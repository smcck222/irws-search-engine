<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 22 Apr--The three-day talks in 
Sevastopol between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers 
on a stage-by-stage settlement of the problems of the Black Sea 
Fleet ended effectively in failure, given that no documents were 
signed as a result. The Russian delegation returned to Moscow 
without holding the concluding meeting with the Ukrainian 
delegation. [passage omitted] 
  "We cannot agree to the staffs of the fleets of two states 
being based in the same town," Grachev emphasized at a news 
conference before flying for Moscow. 
  The Russian defense minister believes that the Ukrainian 
side's position on the basing problem diverges from the accords 
that have been previously reached and with Leonid Kravchuk's 
statements. 
  "Sevastopol should be the main base of Russia's Black Sea 
Fleet. We cannot and do not have the right to undermine its 
combat readiness as an integral part of the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces," Grachev declared. 
  Although no specific documents were signed on the problems 
of 
the Black Sea Fleet, the sides reached fundamental accord on the 
parameters of dividing it up. The delegations agreed that the 
force composition of the Black Sea fleet numbers 833 combatant 
ships and vessels. According to preliminary calculations, 669 
craft should go to Russia and 164 to Ukraine. Given the accords 
reached previously on a 50-50 division of the Black Sea fleet, 
Russia should pay Ukraine compensation for 252 ships. At the 
same time, Grachev pointed out, over the recent period Ukraine 
has unilaterally privatized 126 Black Sea Fleet ships and 
vessels that should have been taken into account when the fleet 
was divided up. 
  Grachev also said that, apart from Sevastopol, the Russian 
Federation side intends to base its subdivisions in Balaklava, 
Feodosiya, Kerch, and Donuzlav. Inter alia, it is planned to 
locate about 70 percent of Russia's part of the fleet in 
Sevastopol, 10 percent in Donuzlav, 5 percent in Balaklava, and 
7 percent each in Feodosiya and Kerch. When the talks started, 
the Ukrainian delegation was insisting that Russia could have 
only one base for its fleet, in Donuzlav. 
  Unless the issue of bases for Russia's Black Sea Fleet and 
Ukraine's Navy is settled, it is inexpedient to start the 
process of dividing up the ships of the fleet, since without a 
land-based infrastructure it cannot exist, Grachev said in 
conclusion.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Over the last few years Ukraine 
has unilaterally "privatized" buildings, structures, engineering 
equipment, property, and ammunition belonging to the Black Sea 
Fleet worth some 94 billion rubles at today's prices. This was 
stated today by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at a news 
conference in Sevastopol when the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the 
problems of the Black Sea Fleet ended. 
  According to the Russian minister, besides 126 ships and 
vessels of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
has seized 38 moorings with a total length of 3,457 meters, 
which is 10 percent of the entire mooring front of the Black Sea 
Fleet. 
  Besides this, Ukraine's military department has seized 2,245 
buildings and structures belonging to the Black Sea Fleet. All 
this, stated Pavel Grachev, should be taken into account during 
the forthcoming dividing up of not only the vessels, but also 
the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 22 Apr -- The Russian military 
delegation has refused to sign any agreements based on the 
results of the talks in Sevastopol on a stage by stage 
settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue. A member of the 
delegation told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that this is due to 
an unconstructive stance adopted by the Ukrainian side on 
questions relating to the basing of the fleets. In his words, 
Russia said it will not agree to the Russian Black Sea Fleet 
being deployed in Crimea merely on a temporary basis, or to the 
proposal that the headquarters of both the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet and of the Ukrainian naval forces being located in 
Sevastopol. 
  It is impossible that the headquarters of the fleets 
belonging to two states should be based in one and the same 
town, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, said 
at a news conference in Sevastopol after the two sides had 
completed their dialogue. He said he is dissatisfied with the 
results of the talks, where the participants came to an 
agreement only with regard to the division of the Fleet. 
  However, according to Pavel Grachev, the process of dividing 
it up cannot start without the question of basing being settled. 
The Russian minister considers that Sevastopol should be 
Russia's principal base, where no less than 70 percent of its 
fleet should be deployed. In addition to Sevastopol, the Black 
Sea Fleet is to be located in Balaklava, Feodosia, Kerch, and 
Donuzlava. Pavel Grachev rejected the proposals of the 
Ukrainian side on the Russian and Ukrainian fleets sharing the 
same bases in Sevastopol. 
  Pavel Grachev flew to Moscow this afternoon without meeting 
Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, the defense minster of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference on the results of his talks on 
a gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet's problems today, 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev described the standpoint 
of the Ukrainian military delegation as unconstructive. It 
follows from his explanation, which cited naval rules, that 
coastal buildings and facilities belonging to the fleet are part 
of the fleet and therefore are a subject of the talks. The 
Ukrainian side, on the other hand, insisted that all this 
property automatically belongs to Ukraine because it is situated 
on its territory. 
  Touching on certain other demands by the Ukrainian 
delegation, Grachev said they were unacceptable and even 
discriminatory with regard to Russia. Specifically, in the view 
of the Russian defense minister, the demand that the whole 
Russian Black Sea Fleet should be concentrated at one base in 
Donuzlav is unacceptable. First, this would contradict the 
notions of military security. Second, it is quite impossible to 
site even part of the fleet's officer corps at Donuzlav. Yuriy 
Dubinin, a representative of the Russian president, who took 
part in the talks, praised the Russian military delegation for 
the diplomatic skill shown and regretted that in spite of this 
the talks produced only a negative result.

<F P=106> [Report by UNIAN correspondent Mariya Starozhitskaya, </F>
specially for IZVESTIYA: "Trying To Divide Black Sea Fleet for 
a Fifth Time"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- The 10 days set aside by the presidents of 
Russia and Ukraine for agreeing the parameters of the division 
of the Black Sea Fleet are not over yet, but the first result 
has already been achieved. [Ukrainian] President Leonid 
Kravchuk has given an assurance that the Ukrainian sailors' pay 
will be no less than that of the Russians (although admittedly 
it will be no higher) and that the question of coordinating the 
term of fixed service must also be resolved: At the moment 
people serve for two years in the Ukrainian Navy, 18 months in 
the Russian Navy. These innovations should help to achieve an 
amicable division of Black Sea Fleet personnel. 
  Replying to IZVESTIYA's question before flying out to the 
Crimea 21 April, [Ukrainian] Defense Minister V. Radetskyy gave 
an assurance that officers and warrant officers will choose 
their place of service solely according to preference: "There 
are no problems at all regarding sailors, soldiers, and petty 
officers -- ships and shore subunits are staffed equally by 
Ukrainians and Russians and among the officers half will be of 
Ukrainian origin. But the human factor must also be taken into 
account, these people have families, apartments, and personal 
ties. But the principle, I repeat, is the same: Everyone will 
serve where they choose." 
  Radetskyy is inclined toward the rapid and constructive 
solution of the problem. In his opinion, this is also true of 
[Russian Defense Minister] Grachev -- recently the ministers 
have been in regular telephone contact with one another. The 
presidents' orders are identical -- matters must be sorted out 
in a calm atmosphere. It is proposed that at the talks being 
held between the defense ministers an agreement will be 
concluded which will envisage the division of the fleet equally 
according to its combat status as of December 1991 (the Black 
Sea Fleet was worth 34 trillion Russian rubles at that time) and 
the sale to Russia -- possibly to the state debt account -- of 
the bulk of the Ukrainian half. After the approval of the 
document by the presidents, 80 percent of the vessels will raise 
the St. Andrew's flag, 20 percent will hoist the Ukrainian flag, 
thus marking the transition to stage two -- the division of 
bases. Several options are being studied here. The most 
popular solution is to lease the Sevastopol base to Russia for 
five years with a subsequent extension of the lease. Ukraine is 
content with the remaining bases from Izmail to Donuzlav. 
Ukrainian Navy headquarters will be transferred to one of them. 
  The ratios have been observed here -- around 80 percent of 
the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure is based at Sevastopol. But 
a quick and easy solution cannot be expected -- the "status of 
Sevastopol" has to be ratified both in the newly elected 
Ukrainian parliament and the State Duma, which has definite 
experience of examining this question. 
  "I see no other possibility of resolving the problem than to 
lease Russia a base for the fleet at Sevastopol and withdraw the 
Ukrainian fleet," Kravchuk noted, "otherwise there will be no 
peace. Right now the fleet, which used to be regarded as a 
common asset -- and I do not want to dramatize things -- is not 
subordinated to Ukraine. It is necessary to sort things out as 
soon as possible so that this becomes Russia's navy under 
Russian laws and Ukraine has its own navy corresponding to its 
needs." 
  The present agreement on the division of the navy is the 
fifth in the past two years. The previous good intentions -- 
the agreements at Dagomys, Yalta, Massandra, and Zavidovo -- 
have not been implemented. Circumstances have changed now, it 
is true -- the Odessa incident showed that it is not only 
inconvenient but dangerous to live a divided existence in the 
same home.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Selivanov report in the "Navy" column: "Where Will </F>
the Ukraine Navy Be Based? It Seems That the `Odessa Incident' 
Has Turned Out Badly for Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Presidents are known to reach accord in principle, 
relying on corresponding ministers and experts for details. In 
this respect the latest Moscow round of talks on the Black Sea 
Fleet problem was not an exception. Yet, as it transpired, this 
time the framework of the general agreement reached appeared too 
broad for the defense ministers of Russia and Ukraine, who met 
in Sevastopol, to come to any mutual understanding. True, 
despite the general vagueness of the formula coordinated in 
Moscow, it has one perfectly unambiguous point: Both presidents 
state the impossibility of joint basing of the two countries' 
navies. No doubt, this conclusion was precipitated by the 
"Odessa incident" which occurred shortly prior to the Moscow 
meeting, in the course of which military servicemen of the two 
countries all but started shooting one another. 
  It is hard to tell what, except emotions, moved Leonid 
Kravchuk to agree to the principle of separate navy basing; yet 
pretty soon it became clear that he has thus driven the Ukraine 
Navy into a corner. Two days later Kiev realized this and made 
a U-turn: It again started saying that Sevastopol should be an 
area for the joint basing of the Ukraine and Russian Navies. 
The reason for such a panicky change of position is evident. 
It suddenly emerged that the Ukraine Navy, apart from 
Sevastopol where it is now located, simply has nowhere else to 
go. And although there are plenty of naval bases on the 
Ukrainian Black Sea coast, the option of redeploying the Ukraine 
Navy somewhere in Donuzlav or moreover Odessa appears quite 
fantastic. Hundreds, and in the future thousands, of Ukraine 
navy officers will simply refuse to move from their cozy 
Sevastopol apartments to a place where nothing is waiting for 
them. Therefore Kiev's agreement to withdraw its fleet from 
Sevastopol is almost synonymous with losing the fleet itself. 
At any rate, the greater part of its officer corps. Aware of 
this, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy during the 
talks in Sevastopol sought to contest the sole specific 
agreement reached by the presidents -- on separate basing of the 
fleets. Yet nothing came of this plan. 
  The presidents' points of view, coordinated in Moscow, have 
touched off an avalanche of irreversible consequences for 
Ukraine. Crimean and Sevastopol city authorities came into the 
game, confirming unequivocally their extremely negative attitude 
to the Ukraine Navy's being based in Sevastopol. 
  Apparently feeling that things have gone too far, Leonid 
Kravchuk, after returning to Kiev, confirmed that Sevastopol 
will be a base of the Russian Navy, although -- he added in the 
same breath -- it will remain a Ukrainian city. This approach 
will hardly arouse particular enthusiasm among the Ukraine 
seamen who have been placed in a quandary by their own 
president. It is perfectly obvious that Russia, relying on the 
presidents' agreements in Moscow, will not back down, especially 
given that in Sevastopol the Russian Navy is today assured 
100-percent public and political support. 
  The Ukraine Navy has been left with only two options, one 
worse than the other: Either to hold on to Sevastopol no matter 
what, which, apart from other things, is fraught with the threat 
of perennial conflicts between the two navies; or to look for a 
new basing location, therefore running the risk of being left 
without the seamen. 
  It is clear today that the so-called "Odessa incident," 
which 
demonstrated graphically the impossibility of the navies' 
coexistence, has ill served Kiev, forcing Leonid Kravchuk to 
accept the separate basing idea. In light of this, the 
excessive excitability demonstrated by the Ukraine military in 
the course of the Odessa events, which manifested itself in an 
unprovoked armed seizure of the 318th Black Sea Fleet Division, 
turned out to be a provocation against Ukraine's own interests, 
whose consequences Kiev will be hard put to neutralize. Unless, 
of course, one presumes that the provocation organically fits 
into a certain confrontation scenario, which is today a subject 
of extensive discussion by many analysts in Kiev.

"Y. Rabin Looks Forward to Meeting With Russia"; from the 
"evening edition"] 
  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated in an 
exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent that during 
his visit to Moscow, which begins on Sunday [24 April], he 
intends to discuss with President Boris Yeltsin and other 
Russian leaders questions concerning a peaceful settlement to 
the Near East conflict and the further development of bilateral 
relations. 
  In connection with this the head of the Israeli Government 
noted in particular: "I am looking forward to my visit to 
Russia. It will be my first visit to Moscow, and these will be 
my first meetings with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. I have already met Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev several times, and in my view, he is a very 
intelligent and businesslike person. I have also met with other 
figures from the upper echelons of the Russian Government. I 
intend to discuss a number of questions concerning bilateral 
relations in the sphere of the economy, trade, and agriculture. 
During my visit certain agreements may be signed. In addition 
I will be going to St. Petersburg -- the native city of my 
mother and her family." 
  Touching on the problems of the Near East settlement, Y. 
Rabin especially stressed that "Russia, as one of the cosponsors 
of the Madrid Conference, could help to create conditions 
facilitating direct talks between ourselves and other 
participants in the conflict. Peace cannot be imposed, but the 
cosponsors can help to bring it nearer." [last sentence omitted 
in later "Nighttime Edition" of newspaper] 
  Dwelling on Israeli-Russian relations, Yitzhaq Rabin noted: 
"Russia is a large country. Many Israeli citizens were born in 
Russia, so that Russian culture has had a huge influence on 
Israel. This applies to music, literature, and poetry. Many 
new immigrants, arriving here from Russia, brought with them 
their extensive abilities in the most varied spheres. I can 
state with confidence that Israel has numerous and deep roots in 
Russia."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] The visit to Russia by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, 
which begins on Sunday [24 April], will be the first in the 
history of bilateral relations. "We have enough things to 
discuss," a senior Foreign Minister official, Viktor Gogitidze, 
told Interfax on Friday. 
  According to him, two big packages of issues will be 
discussed in the course of talks Rabin will have with President 
Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev. "This will include primarily 
Russian-Israeli relations. Solid legal foundations will be built 
for them for the first time ever. Several bilateral agreements, 
accords on cooperation in such areas, as culture, science and 
agriculture among them, are expected to be signed in Moscow," 
the diplomat said. 
  The other package includes issues connected with a 
settlement 
in the Middle East, he said. "Rabin's visit to Moscow is 
particularly important, since it will take place at the 
conclusion of negotiations on Gaza and Jericho. We intend to 
discuss the possible ways out of the complicated situation the 
negotiating process has reached, so that agreements on Gaza and 
Jericho could be signed in the next few days. This would be 
conducive to lowering tensions in the occupied territories," 
Gogitidze said. 
  According to him, "participants in the talks will focus on 
the Syrian direction." "Much in the efforts to gain peace and 
stability in the Middle East will depend on how the things will 
move in that direction. Unfortunately, movement in the Syrian 
direction slowed down of late," the diplomat said. "Therefore 
we intend to discuss separately the Israeli vision of 
settlement, what is needed to break the stalemate in the 
negotiating process, what Russia can do as a cosponsor of the 
peace process and a country that maintains close ties with both 
Syria and Israel." 
  Interfax's interviewee also mentioned Russia's intention to 
get "first-hand information" as to what Rabin meant concretely 
when he proclaimed willingness to remove Israeli settlers from 
the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. "This is a 
totally new development of events," he said. 
  When asked whether Moscow intends to exert "pressure" on 
Rabin, as the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, who visited Moscow 
recently, wanted, Gogitidze said: "As a cosponsor of the peace 
process Russia refrains from exerting pressure on anyone. What 
is needed is a compromise that would suit both sides. Nothing 
should be pressed on any side. What has been pressed on someone 
will never be carried out."

  [Text] The official part of the visit to Russia by Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin started today. It is the first 
such visit in the history of relations between our two 
countries. In the morning the high-ranking guest laid a wreath 
at the tomb of the unknown soldier and honored the memory of the 
Soviet soldiers who lost their lives in the fight against 
fascism. 
  Today Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin received 
the 
Israeli prime minister. They discussed bilateral relations, the 
broadening of economic, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation, 
and international problems, including a settlement of the Middle 
East conflict. Right now the parties are signing six 
intergovernmental agreements on developing cooperation in the 
field of science and culture, the health service, and 
agriculture. The Israeli prime minister plans to meet Vladimir 
Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin, the chairmen of the chambers of the 
Russian parliament, today. Meetings are also planned with 
Russian Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Pavel Grachev. The visit 
will last four days, one of which the Israeli prime minister 
will spend in St. Petersburg, his mother's birthplace.

  [Text] The Russian prime minister has proposed that Russia 
and Israel cooperate on military and defense issues. In a 
meeting between the prime ministers of both countries this 
morning, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin denied 
reports that Russia is going to sell arms to Syria. IDF Radio's 
correspondent Qobi Meydan reports from Moscow: 
  [Begin recording] [Meydan] Israeli sources described the 
meeting between the Russian and Israeli prime ministers as good, 
even excellent. The highlight of this meeting was Russian Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin's proposal for military and defense 
cooperation with Israel. At the same time, Mr. Chernomyrdin 
denied that Russia is about to sell arms to Syria. When the 
issue came up, the Russian prime minister, after denying such 
reports, turned to Rabin and suggested that Israel purchase 
weapons from the Russians. Rabin, for his part, raised some 
additional issues. 
  [Rabin] I raised several issues in the hope that Russia, 
which is currently resuming its activity as cosponsor [last word 
in English] of the negotiations, will help us reach agreements 
first with the Palestinians and Syria -- which of course are the 
two key issues -- and then with Jordan and Lebanon. We also 
hope that Russia will use its connections with Iran, Syria, and 
other Arab countries to create an atmosphere conducive to peace. 
  [Meydan] Viktor Chernomyrdin said that Russia will remain an 
active mediator in the Middle East peace process, just as it has 
been active in other areas of conflict, such as Yugoslavia. The 
two men also discussed the recent tension surrounding Russia's 
uncoordinated involvement in the peace process. Both sides 
preferred to withhold comment on this. 
  As for economic issues, a series of agreements, from 
agriculture to culture and science, were signed at the meeting. 
The trade agreement between Russia and Israel has still not 
been signed. The Russians are pressing to sign the trade 
agreement in the course of Rabin's visit, perhaps by tomorrow. 
Experts are currently at work formulating the agreement. The 
problem is Israel's fears of Russia flooding the local market 
with cheap products. Prime Minister Rabin, who realized how 
important this is to the Russian officials, instructed the 
Israeli team to step up its efforts to find an acceptable 
formulation that will allow the agreement to be signed. 
  At the Jewish Agency building in Moscow, Rabin met with 
Russian immigrants due to fly to Israel tonight. He also met 
with a group of Hebrew teachers from various CIS republics. 
Rabin told everyone that despite all the difficulties, their 
place is in Israel. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 25 April, 
in 
a report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz, adds that "a 
high-level Russian delegation, including several government 
ministers, left for Syria this morning in order to discuss 
future arms deals; however, Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin 
categorically promised his guest Yitzhaq Rabin that it had been 
authorized to discuss only the sale of spare parts for arms 
Syria already possesses and not arms deals for new weapons." 
The report adds that "Rabin told his host that Ron Arad is 
being held either by Iran or by an Iranian element in Lebanon" 
and that "Chernomyrdin promised that Russia will do everything 
in its power to come up with information on this matter. 
Another issue discussed was the sale of a Russian power plant 
to Iran. The Russian prime minister promised that the plant 
would supply only electric power and plays no part in Iran's 
attempts to attain nuclear capability." Qol Yisra'el notes that 
"the Russians continue to support sanctions against Iraq, a fact 
that was also welcomed by the Israeli delegation."]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- "The position of the Russian 
Government and president on Middle East is that settlement in 
the area should be reached by peaceful means and that all armed 
clashes should stop. Our position on settlement in former 
Yugoslavia is the same," Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the 
Russian Federation Government, said today while answering 
questions from journalists after the conclusion of his talks 
with Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the state of Israel. 
  The head of the Russian cabinet emphasized particularly that 
the Russian government "intends to do everything possible to 
reach a peace settlement in the Middle East". 
  At the end of intergovernment Russian-Israeli talks, which 
lasted about two hours, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yitzhaq Rabin 
signed six agreements between the governments of the two 
countries: on scientific and technical cooperation, on economic, 
scientific and technical cooperation in the agro-industrial 
complex, on avoiding dual taxation, on cooperation in health 
care and medicine, on cooperation in education and culture and 
on cooperation in tourism. 
  Highly assessing the importance of these agreements for the 
development of bilateral relations, the Russian premier spoke 
about the necessity for the conclusion of a Russian-Israeli 
document on trade and economic relations in the immediate 
future. He pointed out that Russia and Israel have favorable 
prospects for expanding cooperation in various spheres including 
the economy and military spheres. 
  It has become known to the ITAR-TASS correspondent from 
sources in the Russian Government delegation that during the 
talks various aspects of Russian-Israeli relations were 
discussed in detail and that the two sides spoke in favor of 
developing mutually beneficial trade and economic cooperation. 
The importance of strengthening the friendly relations between 
Russia and Israel, of which the broad cultural and humanitarian 
ties are an important factor, was also pointed out during the 
talks. A number of topical international issues including the 
situation in the Middle East were also discussed. 
  Repying to the question whether the "Zhirinovskiy 
phenomenon" 
has any influence on increasing the threat of anti-Semitism in 
Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin gave the assurance that "a large 
number of Jews live today in Russia but they are not threatened 
by any kind of anti-Semitism and that no kind of `Zhirinovskiys' 
will be able to whip up anti-Semitism." "Fascism or 
anti-Semitism will not prevail in Russia. Though, of course, 
there are certain forces which would like to agitate the 
situation by bringing up the ethnic issue."

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Viktor Viktorovich Posuvalyuk, </F>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special representative for a 
settlement in the Middle East, by correspondent Vitaliy Gan; 
from the "Panorama" program--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Gan] With us in the studio is Viktor Viktorovich 
Posuvalyuk, the Russian president's special representative for a 
settlement in the Middle East. Viktor Viktorovich, PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat has just ended a visit to Russia. Yitzhaq Rabin 
began a visit today. It is thought that attempts are being made 
to draw Moscow more actively into Middle Eastern affairs. 
However, some say that after our diplomacy's major fiasco in 
Bosnia, this is the last straw. What do you think? 
  [Posuvalyuk] Vitaliy, despite the shortage of time and the 
fact that this is not my area of competence, not my territory, I 
would like very briefly to oppose the view of those who talk 
about the fiasco of Russian diplomacy in Yugoslav affairs. 
First, this problem is insoluble without Russia. Second, 
events have revealed the nonuniformity, the political diversity 
of the Bosnian Serbs. Third, I am convinced that had it not been 
for the minister's visit--had it not been for Vitaliy Churkin's 
mission--events would immediately have acquired an even more 
ominous nature. Fourth, and maybe most importantly, strong-arm 
methods are not in themselves effective. As someone who sat 
through the bombing in Baghdad during the Gulf War, I can very 
definitely testify to that. 
  Now with regard to the visits, Russia, as a great power, has 
two key roles with relation to the Middle East. First, it is a 
close neighbor, a major power with very broad 
interests--economic, political, spiritual, religious, and, of 
course, military. Its second role is as a permanent member of 
the Security Council and a cosponsor alongside the United States 
in the Middle East peace process. These visits and 
talks--'Arafat's visit that has already taken place and Rabin's 
visit that has begun--will be guided by these two functions, 
Russia's political functions in the Middle East. 
  There have already been and there will be specific 
conversations on bilateral relations. At the same time, the 
president and the minister have already heard 'Arafat's view, 
and now they will have conversations with Rabin on the state of 
the Middle East peace process. Here there are mutual claims and 
reproaches from both sides. I think that Russia has an 
opportunity as cosponsor to smooth out some points and move 
matters forward. God willing, an agreement on Gaza and Jericho 
will be signed at the beginning of May. 
  [Gan] It is said that 'Arafat's authority and influence in 
the Arab world has been on the decline since he signed the 
agreement with Israel. Is that correct? 
  [Posuvalyuk] I think it would be more correct not to talk 
about how far 'Arafat's popularity rating has risen or fallen. 
I think the point is that 'Arafat has risked his political 
career, his political future. Here one must talk not just about 
'Arafat but about Prime Minister Rabin as well. In our view, 
these are courageous political leaders; they are undoubtedly 
courageous. Take 'Arafat, for example. People are burning 
photographs of him, burning effigies. Incidentally, it is not 
only the loudmouths and extremists who are talking about this, 
but also sometimes, unfortunately, some of our correspondents 
who are there. Take [RTV correspondent] Vladislav Flyarkovskiy 
in Tel Aviv, who relishes this subject and has reported on it 
several times already. Although, incidentally, Israeli 
television avoids reports of that kind because they understand 
that the matter concerns a political partner. They are 
effectively in the same boat. Their future depends on the 
outcome of the peace process. 
  As for Rabin, I was in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently, and 
I 
saw how the radical left-wing [as heard], the extremist wing of 
Israel's political structure, is trying to whip up hysteria 
against the government. For Rabin, it is an enormous 
psychological strain to drive around the city and see 
everywhere: "Rabin, Rabin the Traitor". I am convinced, 
however, that the majority of both Palestinians and Israelis are 
in favor of the peace process and the continuation of talks. 
  [Gan] Viktor Viktorovich, what do you think are the 
prospects 
for a peaceful settlement? 
  [Posuvalyuk] Well, we have the image--perhaps it is 
hackneyed-- of light at the end of the tunnel. Using the same 
image, I will say that for many decades--the conflict has been 
going on practically since the beginning of the century--for 
many decades, at the end of the tunnel there was either gloom 
and darkness or the fire of six wars and innumerable senseless 
conflicts. Now a distant light has appeared. I would not like 
to fall into euphoria; a distant light has appeared. We all 
fell into euphoria, incidentally, after 13 September, when the 
Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington. Maybe we 
even underestimated the strength of opposition to the peace 
process. So a distant light has appeared. In the Palestinian 
talks, in particular, things are moving forward. I say let us 
hope that an agreement will be signed at the beginning of May.

  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The amount of 
Russian-Turkish military cooperation may be significantly 
increased in the near future, announced Russian First 
Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets during his meeting on Friday with 
Turkish Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan. At the same time, both 
sides confirmed that their cooperation in the military sphere 
must not be detrimental to the interests of any third country. 
  The two diplomats wholeheartedly called for the Black Sea 
region to become an area of peace and calm. With that goal in 
mind, they agreed to combine their efforts to put out the fires 
of conflicts in the Caucasus region and the Balkans. 
  The Turkish defence minister reported that his country was 
ready to discuss the possibility of Russia's participating in 
the construction of safe, relatively small heating and nuclear 
power plants in Turkey. 
  In turn, Soskovets voiced Russia's willingness to positively 
respond to Turkey's overtures and study the possibility of 
building a natural gas pipe-line through Georgian and Turkish 
territory. The implementation of such a project would 
noticeably improve the economic situation in Georgia, which is 
suffering from a severe lack of energy resources. He noted that 
the technical and economic foundation for the project could be 
completed as quickly as within two or three months. 
  Both sides expressed their willingness to sign an agreement 
on cooperation in the training of military personnel in the near 
future.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 Apr -- Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose 
Raul Mulino arrived today in the Russian capital on a visit. It 
is the first visit to Russia by the head of Panama's foreign 
policy department since diplomatic relations were established 
between the two countries in March 1991.

expected also with other members of the Russian cabinet of 
ministers, parliamentarians, and representatives of Russian 
business circles. 
  The talks are expected to result in the signing of a 
declaration on the principles governing the development of 
bilateral relations and a joint statement of intent to raise the 
status of diplomatic missions to the level of embassies. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on the eve of the visit 
Mulino 
stated that the Panamanian Government attaches tremendous 
importance to the development and strengthening of mutually 
beneficial relations with Russia. "Panama and Russia today share 
common ideals, based on a respect for democratic principles and 
open access to national economies," he stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs today expressed hope that Tsutomu Hata's 
election as Japan's prime minister will promote "the positive 
development of the whole range of bilateral relations and 
consistent and constructive movement toward genuine partnership 
and good-neighbourliness on the basis of the strategic policy 
laid down during the Russian-Japanese summit meetings." 
  In a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, a 
high-ranking official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation reaffirmed Moscow's immutable policy toward 
the development of comprehensive relations with Japan on the 
basis of the Tokyo Declaration adopted during Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October. Koji Watanabe, 
Japan's ambassador to Russia, expressed a similar stand in a 
recent interview to ITAR-TASS. 
  The Russian diplomat recalled that during Tsutomu Hata's 
visit to Moscow last month while in the posts of deputy prime 
minister and minister of foreign affairs, "the positive mood 
that has been predominant in Russian-Japanese relations recently 
was very clearly demonstrated". 
  The foreign ministry official noted that the two sides "face 
a major task to fill in specific details to the agreements 
reached in Tokyo last October and to bring them to a practical 
level." He expressed hope that "this work will succeed through 
joint efforts in line with the key interests of the Russian and 
the Japanese people." 
  The Russian diplomat said that "active political dialogue 
with Japan, including top level contacts, will help" to achieve 
these aims. He recalled that an invitation to visit Russia was 
handed to the Japanese prime minister last October and confirmed 
in March; it remains in force despite the change of government 
in Japan. Bearing in mind that the Russian head of state 
visited Japan last year, the diplomat said, it is now the turn 
of the Japanese. 
  According to the high-ranking official from the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, "there is every reason to look with optimism 
at the future of Russian-Japanese relations, even though both 
sides will naturally have to make intense efforts to further 
these relations -- a point on which the two countries see eye to 
eye."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- A senior official of 
President Yeltsin's administration has stressed the important 
role of ex-prime minister of Japan Morihiro Hokosawa in the 
development of relations between the two countries. He 
expressed hope that the new Japanese government, headed by 
Tsutomu Hata who was elected prime minister today, would pursue 
the same policy in this sphere. 
  "I think Hosokawa has done very much for the development of 
Russian-Japanese relations," head of a department of the press 
service of the Russian president and specialist in Japanese 
studies Aleksandr Orfenov told ITAR-TASS today. In his opinion, 
Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October is proof to it. Important 
documents were signed during the visit. 
  "We hope Hata will continue the political course of the 
previous cabinet, aimed at developing relations with the Russian 
Federation," the spokesman for the president's press service 
said. In his opinion, Hata's statements during his visit to 
Moscow last March give grounds for such hope. Judging by those 
statements, he is a sober-minded politician. 
  According to Orfenov, it is regrettable that during Tsutomu 
Hata's recent visit to Moscow President Yeltsin was on leave in 
Sochi and could not meet him. At that time Tsutomu Hata was 
deputy prime minister and head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. 
"I think it would be useful for them both to meet and establish 
personal contacts," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, April 25 KYODO -- A senior Russian official 
on Monday [25 April] lauded Japan's new prime minister-to-be 
Tsutomu Hata for his past contributions to improving bilateral 
ties. 
  "Mr. Hata contributed to a smooth development of the 
Russia-Japan relationship," said Nikolay Solovyov, director of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's Asia-Pacific Department. 
  Hata is expected to be elected Japan's new prime minister 
later in the day following the resignation of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet. 
  Hata visited Russia in March as foreign minister, and 
assured 
Russian leaders of Japan's continued support for reforms. 
  Solovyov, a former Russian ambassador to Tokyo, also called 
for progress in bilateral relations to solve "the issue that is 
difficult to reach an agreement on," -- an apparent reference to 
the thorny territorial question. 
  The dispute over a group of Russian-held islands off 
Hokkaido, which Japan claims are part of its territory, has kept 
the bilateral relations in a chill since the end of World War II.

  [Text] On Saturday in Vladivostok, a Russian-Japanese 
inter-governmental commission concluded the Russian stage of the 
discussions devoted to the search for ways to solve the problem 
of storage and re-processing of liquid radioactive wastes which 
is very pressing for the Maritime territory today. The work is 
to be continued in Tokyo. On April 24 the joint delegation is 
to go to Japan. 
  In the course of the conference a concept of a complex 
approach to the selection of different means was presented to 
the Japanese party which proposes to the Maritime territory its 
financial and technological assistance to solve the problem of 
storage and utilization of liquid radioactive wastes. 
  It was proposed to urgently start construction of a complex 
of surface stationary storage facilities for liquid radioactive 
wastes with the capacity 2000 cubic meters on the coast of the 
cape of Sysoyev which would have all necessary systems and 
mechanisms to prevent leakage of liquid radioactive wastes from 
the tankers TNT. 
  The second stage, namely designing and construction of an 
autonomous mobile floating complex to re-process liquid 
radioactive wastes available and being generated in the Maritime 
territory (which can be dumped into the open sea), is to be 
implemented simultaneously. 
  As head of the Russian delegation Nikolay Yegorov, Russia's 
deputy Atomic Energy Minister and co-chairman of the 
Russian-Japanese committee on nuclear disarmament, underlined, 
the developed approach to the problem of liquid radioactive 
wastes in the Maritime territory expresses a single opinion of 
the Russian party and is proposed as the most acceptable variant 
in case the Japanese party finances the planned works.

  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The issue of introduction of 
U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea due to its suspected 
development of nuclear arms is not on today's agenda, head of 
the Korean division of the Russian Foreign Ministry's First 
Asian Department Valentin Moiseyev told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  In his words, the Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the 
fact diplomatic methods have not been exhausted. This stand is 
shared by other interested nations, including China, said 
Moiseyev. 
  The official reminded of the Russian proposal to convene a 
multilateral conference on security and non-nuclear status of 
the Korean peninsula, which, in his words, "has been positively 
estimated by all potential participants in the conference with 
the exception of North Korea". The potential participants 
include the Russian federation, the United States, China, Japan, 
North Korea, South Korea, as well as representatives of the 
United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  At the same time, Moscow is using all political methods to 
influence Pyongyang and has informed North Korea of its stand, 
said Moiseyev. For instance, Moscow has invited the deputy 
North Korean foreign minister to visit Russia in early summer 
within the framework of bilateral diplomatic contacts. But all 
Russian diplomatic efforts "cannot have a force nature or 
pressure form," stressed the official. 
  If the question of sanctions or russian participation in 
them 
is raised, "one will have to take into account feasible 
consequences of this step not only for North Korea but also for 
Russia," said Moiseyev. 
  The Russian-North Korean goods turnover amounted to 530 
million U.S. dollars in 1993, which is 25-30 per cent of the 
North Korean foreign trade turnover. Russia exported 450 
millions worth of goods to North Korea and purchased 80 millions 
worth of products there. The problem of the North Korean debt to 
the former Soviet Union and Russia, which is estimated at 
approximately three billion dollars, remains unsettled.

<F P=106> ["KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Investigation" article by Sergey </F>
Pluzhnikov, Sergey Sokolov, and Mikhail Morozov "prepared from 
materials from more than 100 open Western and Russian 
publications": "Will Kim Il-song Explode Our Atom Bomb?"] 
  [Excerpts] There has long been a debate over North Korea's 
preparations for a nuclear attack on imperialism -- a debate 
which, with time, has been attracting more and more new rumors 
and facts. For a long time this problem remained overshadowed by 
the real nuclear threats to the world posed by the superpowers. 
But now that a relative lull has ensued in the years-long arms 
race between the United States and the USSR, readers have been 
swamped by a wave of information about North Korea's hush-hush 
nuclear program from the pages of many countries' respectable 
publications. Grandfather Kim Il-song, whose "chuche" ideas 
elicited only a wry smile, was instantly transformed by 
journalists' pens into a maniac capable of pressing the nuclear 
button at any moment. The current surge of interest, mixed with 
fear, in North Korea's nuclear affairs has also been occasioned 
by the proximity of this "preserve of socialism" to Japan, the 
only country to have experienced the nightmare of nuclear 
bombing raids. Recently all the arguments have boiled down to 
one question -- does Kim Il-song have a bomb, with whose help he 
could smash to smithereens a very strong mainstay of the world 
economy? [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Hand of Moscow </H5>
  An unprecedented scandal, connected with the improvement of 
missiles and of the DPRK nuclear program as a whole, erupted in 
October 1992. Security Ministry staffers detained 36 Russian 
scientists at Sheremetyevo-2 Airport. They had been intending 
to fly to Pyongyang along with their families. 
  It later came to light that prominent representatives of the 
Russian military-industrial complex had wanted to get jobs in 
the DPRK and had already drawn up contracts: Professor Arkadiy 
Bakhmutov, specialist in rocket engine building and winner of 
the Komsomol [All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League] Prize; 
Doctor of Sciences Valeriy Strakhov, department head at the 
Scientific Research Institute of Special Machine Building in 
Bochkovo; Yuriy Bessarabov, one of the creators of the Zyb 
rocket and a Komsomol Prize winner; and other specialists in the 
sphere of rocket building. The organizer of this work landing 
force on the Russian side was Anatoliy Rubtsov, a specialist in 
the sphere of solid state physics well known in the circles of 
scientists working for the military-industrial complex. The 
organizer on the DPRK side was Major General Nam Chae-uk, who 
was declared persona non grata by the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Security. 
  Anatoliy Rubtsov told journalists that a plan had existed to 
send 200 Russian scientists to the DPRK to create the scientific 
base of North Korean rocket building. "I did not initiate it," 
Rubtsov maintained. "In August 1992 Stepanov, chief of the 
Russian Federation Industry Ministry Machine Building 
Administration, visited North Korea and signed a general 
agreement in this regard. It was proposed that I form a group. 
But South Korea promised Russia aid of $1 billion, and the 
Russian Government abruptly changed the state policy and agreed 
to restrictions in relations with the DPRK." At the same time 
Rubtsov said that the North Koreans had "approached" him back in 
April 1991, when he was lecturing in Beijing: "I was made a 
suitable offer of permanent work, and I accepted it. I was 
elected a member of the North Korean Academy of Sciences and 
appointed director of a scientific research institute. My 
younger sister passed dollars to someone at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and in exchange obtained from the First Consular 
Section clean passports for 200 people to travel abroad. The 
money had been passed to me by a representative of the North 
Korean Embassy in Moscow, and my receipt was sent to Pyongyang." 
  Almost all the scientists detained at Sheremetyevo-2 told 
journalists the same thing: "It is all the same to us for which 
political purposes our knowledge might be used; we only wanted 
to carry on doing our favorite thing." 
  According to data in some respectable publications, more 
than 
20 Russian scientists nonetheless managed to get work in the 
DPRK (mainly through China). They live there under aliases, 
make $3,000-4,000 a month, and want for nothing. According to 
press allegations, however, some of our scientists no longer 
need to risk and negotiate border checkpoints in order to work 
on the North Korean nuclear program. They sit at home and send 
their calculations to Pyongyang by computer mail, which it is 
not yet possible to monitor. 
<H5>  Patriot Games </H5>
  Strange though it may seem, the noisy and protracted scandal 
surrounding North Korea's nuclear program is advantageous to 
almost all the political forces involved in it. Kim Il-song, by 
ambiguously denying the existence of the bomb and not admitting 
International Atomic Energy Agency experts to certain nuclear 
installations, is attracting universal attention to his rotten 
regime and probably hoping in the future to secure some 
financial injections for the paralyzed economy. Russia is 
getting a strong argument in its dialogue with Japan over the 
transfer of the northern territories: Forget about the Kurils 
for the time that it takes to neutralize all our scientists, 
without whom the DPRK nuclear program will simply collapse. 
Incidentally, Russia, which is still lagging behind the grand 
international politics of the United States, is in the worst 
position in this game -- there is a great risk of losing for a 
very long time its former influence in this region, as well as 
any hope of recovering the multibillion [currency not specified] 
debt from the DPRK. China, remaining neutral in respect of 
Pyongyang's semimythical nuclear threat, awaits an easing of the 
U.S. economic sanctions. The Japanese military is acquiring 
authority and influence in its own state, increasingly 
insistently demanding that the government increase defense 
appropriations. Finally, the United States and NATO, 
successfully prompting Japan to create -- with their 
participation, naturally -- a costly ABM "umbrella," are 
cherishing the hope of securing not only military orders worth 
billions [currency not specified] but also access to unique 
Japanese technologies, which, as a result, will enable the 
Americans to weaken their main economic rival. Seoul with its 
10 million residents, keeping calm, as usual, when targeted by 
North Korea's 8,400 howitzers and 2,400 missile launchers, is 
more concerned about rice prices at present. 
  All this resembles a cynically conceived conspiracy, in 
which 
all are at one, but the leading role is, of course, played by 
the United States. Only it is of very great concern that in 
such games the situation frequently gets out of control.

  [Text] State Duma deputies received Thursday the second 
version of the Civic Accord draft developed by a working group 
created by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The new draft 
removes the thesis on non-utilization of assessments of the 
events of August 1991 and September 1993 as factors behind 
heightened social confrontation from the political section of 
the first draft. 
  The provision committing parties to the agreement to refrain 
from amending the Constitution in such a way as to destabilize 
society is retained. However, the new document does permit 
conciliatory procedures to draft amendments and additions to the 
Basic Law in the interests of strengthening human rights and 
improving the system of power division, local government and the 
development of federalism. 
  The new document, in contrast to the original, specifies the 
commitments of state authorities in politics and economics. 
  For instance, the Federation Council and State Duma must, in 
the short term, pass legislation governing elections, and laws 
on referendums, parties, the rights of citizens to form 
associations, and the procedure for holding demonstrations and 
other public and politically-orientated events. The two 
parliament chambers are also responsible for the creation of a 
legislative base to overcome the social and political crisis, 
including by means of passing a Constitutional Law in the next 
six months on the government, a Budget Law, Civil and land codes 
and a number of other acts. 
  In turn, the government is bound by the draft to bring 
inflation down in 1994 and guarantee financial stabilization. 
It will attract more investments and create a platform for 
economic recovery. It will ensure that the principles of social 
partnership and other aspects of the country's life are applied. 
  Regarding national security, the document contains new 
provisions on the joint responsibility of the president, the 
Federation Council, the State Duma and the government to reform 
the law and order bodies. The draft also recommends that the 
speakers of both chambers of parliament take an active role in 
the work of the Russian Security Council and involve 
representatives of the relevant committees of both chambers in 
the interdepartmental Security Council commissions. 
  Provisions on accountability for violating the Treaty are 
have been reworded and amplified: now, according to the 
document, the Conciliatory Commission of authorized 
representatives of the president, the government, the chambers 
of the Federal Assembly, State Duma fractions, the Public 
Chamber under the president, and trade unions will "ensure that 
the provisions written into the acting Document are observed." 
In the original, the Conciliatory Commission had the right to 
raise the issue of removing the signature of any party to the 
Accord discovered to have violated the said agreement and may 
use the mass media as a means of informing the nation of such 
violations. It may also propose measures concerning the 
political accountability of such persons "including their 
dismissal from office or stripping of their deputy's mandate." 
  The document includes a new section on the procedure for 
signing the Accord, which the working group explains as follows: 
the Accord is signed by the president, the speakers of both 
chambers of parliament, the head of government, the leaders of 
constituent members of the Federation, and by authorized 
representatives of political parties in the State Duma, the 
presidential Public Chamber and trade unions "after which the 
Accord will be open for signature by other parties."

  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Those who wish to 
frustrate civic accord demand that the signing of the civic 
accord agreement fixed for April 28 be put off. This view was 
expressed by Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian president's 
administration, at a meeting with chief editors of the Russian 
media in ITAR-TASS news agency on Thursday, the day the 
agreement is discussed at a meeting of the State Duma. 
  Filatov said that 50 telegrams from chiefs of Russian 
regions 
who are ready to sign the agreement without any reservations had 
been received in the Kremlin by now. He said the text of the 
document had been supported by 12 trade union leaders, all 
religious confessions, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the 
Council of Veterans and other public organisations. Chiefs of 
administrations of a number of territories and regions, as well 
as leaders of some parties, sent to the president's apparatus 
their proposals and remarks to the text of the document which 
are discussed by the working group headed by director of the 
institute of state and law of the Russian Academy of Science, 
Boris Topornin. Filatov noted that the presidential 
administration does not interfere in the activity of the group 
for perfecting the draft agreement and brings no presure on it 
whatsoever. He said the opposition took advantage of the pause 
in the preparation for the signing of the civic accord 
agreement. Therefore he believes that the document should be 
adopted before May 1 and that as many signatories as possible 
should be involved.

  [Text] The Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms (RMDR) 
"approves both the basic ideas and the principles" of the 
president-presented draft Agreement on civic accord in Russia, 
however, it "cannot sign it" until the document is 
"substantially revised and supplemented, especially with respect 
to the actions of the government," chairman of the RMDR Gavriil 
Popov declared at a press conference on Thursday in Moscow. 
  In his opinion, it is "harmful" to include the obligations 
to 
observe the RF Constitution into the text of the document 
because "this allegedly gives the right not to observe the 
Constitution to those who do not sign this document." Popov 
believes that the draft is saturated "with promises, statements 
of intent, and declarations" which have much in common with "the 
CPSU Central Committee appeals on May 1," said Popov. 
  One can voluntarily oblige oneself to temporarily not use 
the 
rights granted by the Constitution, for example, the right to 
urge early elections, only in the case "if it is clearly and 
precisely stated for what sake the participants of the agreement 
are abstaining from these or those rights." To this effect Popov 
noted that the draft document "does not contain any precise or 
concrete program of actions with determined dates which are also 
coordinated between major participants of the agreement." 
"There are practically no concrete obligations in the 
agreement, namely to lower taxes by so-and-so percent, to ensure 
such-and-such a rate of inflation, etc.," he said. He drew 
attention to the fact that "the draft does not contain any 
obligations of the government to resign and the State Duma's 
obligations to announce about its self-disbandment in case it 
fails to fulfill concrete obligations in concrete terms." 
  According to Popov, "the activity around this document 
disorients Russia's peoples, creating an illusion of progress." 
He warned that the Agreement "could be a trap into which the 
president and his advisers are being driven." 
  Responding to Interfax, Popov reported that the majority of 
the members of the movement's political council which is to 
finally determine the RMDR position adhere to the same point of 
view.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 23 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
newspaper quotes the Russian president's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov who told a Kremlin briefing on Friday that 
Boris Yeltsin hopes for the success of the treaty on public 
accord which is to be signed on April 28. 
  The newspaper prints the full text of a statement by the 
leaders of the member republics of the Russian Federation, which 
was adopted on April 21 after a meeting with the Russian 
president. The statement expresses support for the agreement. 
  At the same time, the newspaper singles out a report that 
the 
Russian parliament lower house is not ready to sign the 
document, since its new version needs examination. 
  It is reported that parliamentary groups intend to discuss 
it 
at party conferences, and political councils of parties in the 
remaining days before April 28 "to hammer out a common position". 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper carries, in this 
connection, 
an article by Valeriy Zorkin, the former chairman of the Russian 
constitutional court, who claims that "national accord cannot be 
`introduced' by any decree". 
  According to Zorkin, "real compromise means strict 
implementation of clearly outlined top priority measures 
supported by all or the majority of people, without which it 
will be impossible to check the country's sliding to a dreadful 
disaster". 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper concentrates on the talks 
between the Russian and Ukrainian military delegations in 
Sevastopol. 
  The commentary on this topic says that the agreement signed 
in Moscow on a gradual settlement of Black Sea Fleet problems 
"was in actual fact a compromise and a concession of the Russian 
side for the earliest settlement of contradictions between the 
neighbouring countries". 
  However, the Ukrainian military delegation at the Sevastopol 
talks "sees weak positions of the partners in the dialogue 
behind the concession and puts forth absurd demands having 
nothing to do with the presidents' understanding". 
  The military leaders have not cleared up the question which 
was unequivocally settled by the presidents: "to divide the 
Black Sea Fleet bases", the newspaper continues. The way out of 
the Black Sea deadlock "has only gleamed in the distance but has 
not fully appeared for the negotiating sides". 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper features an open letter to 
Boris Yeltsin adopted by a meeting of the Union of Russian 
North-Western Cities held in the city of Kirov. 
  It expresses concern that administration heads of such big 
Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivostok and Nizhny Novgorod 
were released from their posts under the pressure of regional 
governors over the past few months. 
  The newspaper claims that the posts were left by honest 
people vitally interested in the prosperity of their cities. 
The message contains a demand to carry out inspections in 
connection with complaints of ousted administration heads and to 
publish their results. 
  The TRUD newspaper carries an interview with director of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin on 
corruption in executive bodies. Confirming the existence of 
corruption, including in the top echelon, he stressed: "We know 
about this and actively work in this direction", but there is no 
point in raising ballyhoo about this. 
  "We declare an all-out war on corruption", the struggle 
against which, as general struggle against crime, "becomes an 
important task of ensuring national security", Stepashin 
stressed. 
  The Moscow press gives an extensive coverage to the 
situation 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin said in an interview with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI that 
Serbs' continued attacks in the area of Gorazde lead to their 
disaster. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes the following: 
Since 
Russia abides by the opinion that "one should not be in a hurry 
to spread the zone of air strikes in Bosnia", it turns out that 
Russia, the United States, the EU and the U.N. "have no common 
approach to a solution of the crisis". 
  The newspaper claims that the absence of a common diplomatic 
plan for a settlement will lead to a sitation when "a decision 
will be taken, most probably, without taking into consideration 
Russia's opinion". 
  According to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, Moscow and 
Washington do not intend to yield the palm to each other in 
initiatives. The Kremlin insists on calling a summit on former 
Yugoslavia, and the White House does not object against this, 
suggesting only that it should be prepared well. 
  In the meantime, the newspaper states, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton put forth his own plan providing for "possible further 
air strikes on Serbs". 
  The PRAVDA newspaper runs information on demonstrations and 
rallies in Moscow by opposition forces on the occasion of 
Vladimir Lenin's birthday. The newspaper describes in detail 
exhibits of an exposition named "Attempt on Memory" which opened 
at the Pavilion "Lenin's Funeral Train" on Friday.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 22 April TASS -- The majority of 
Moldovan parliament deputies described as interference in 
Moldovan internal affairs the statement of the Romanian 
parliament's Chamber of Deputies denouncing the ratification of 
documents on Moldovan joining of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States and the Commonwealth economic union. 
  An appeal of the Moldovan parliament adopted here today 
reminded that Moldova is an independent state recognized by over 
100 nations, primarily Romania. 
  At the same time, efforts to consolidate Moldovan statehood, 
accord and good-neighbourly atmosphere in the European region 
encounter "fierce resistance of some nationalist-extremist 
politicians, who do not even want to hear about sovereign and 
independent Moldova," says the document. 
  The appeal stressed that the majority of Moldovan citizens 
supported building of independent Moldovan state at the recent 
parliamentary elections.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 78 (568): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] On Friday afternoon President Boris Yeltsin met with 
leaders of the State Duma factions. The meeting focused on a 
draft agreement on civil accord. The new document which is in 
essence a reviewed variant of the draft was discussed the day 
earlier by the State Duma. The opinions of the leaders of the 
factions differed. Leaders of agrarians, communists, liberal 
democrats stated their negative attitude to the draft. These 
factions control more than one third of deputy mandates. The 
document was also criticized by representatives of the factions 
Yabloko, New Regional Policy and Russian Democratic Party. 
However, they noted that the final position on this issue will 
be determined by the factions later. 
  The draft agreement on civil accord was unconditionally 
supported by representatives of the factions Russia's Choice, 
the Russian Unity and Accord Party and Russia's Women. 
  Summarizing the results of hearings, speaker of the State 
Duma Ivan Rybkin stated that "he was absolutely not 
disappointed" with the discussion. Speaking to journalists he 
pointed out that deputies' speeches were "adequate to what is 
happening in the country." 
  Rybkin considers that it is far from certain that political 
parties at their conferences, plenums and congresses scheduled 
for this weekend would support positions of their parliamentary 
factions which spoke against signing the civil accord agreement. 
IF Note: According to the presidential plan, the original 
formula for signing the document on April 28 is as follows: the 
agreement should be signed by the president, chairmen of the 
parliament's chambers, prime minister, heads of the federation's 
subjects, and plenipotentiary representatives of political 
parties represented in the State Duma, the Public Chamber of the 
president, trade unions, "and after that the agreement should be 
opened for the signing by other sides." 
  In this connection, experts indicate a considerable 
probability that next Thursday the signing ceremony will be held 
without representatives of most major parties represented in the 
Duma. Some experts do not rule out that among participants in 
this solemn ceremony there will be no the speaker of the lower 
chamber. According to their forecasts, that may happen if 
deputies, in response to the LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
refuse to authorize the speaker with signing the agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with G.A. Satarov, aide to the Russian Federation </F>
president, by Vasily Kononenko; date and place not given: 
"Those Not Signing Accord Treaty Will Not Be Branded `Enemies 
of the People'"] 
  [Text] The concluding phase of work on the Treaty on Social 
Accord has clearly run into a holdup. A number of State Duma 
factions have delivered virtually an ultimatum demanding that 
their "specific interests" be taken into account. It is 
possible that this show of dissidence was organized in order to 
reserve themselves a place on the sidelines of the system, which 
not everyone in society is greeting with applause. 
  Most likely greater clarity will emerge in this process 
following the meeting between B. Yeltsin and representatives of 
Federal Assembly factions. What are expected at that meeting 
are a speech from the president, a report on the attitude to the 
treaty of the main political forces and regions, which will be 
delivered by S. Filatov, leader of the president's 
administration, and speeches from the leaders of both houses of 
parliament, and also faction leaders. Nevertheless, the main 
approaches and stances with regard to this most important 
document can be seen right now. The president's aide G. Satarov 
answered the IZVESTIYA correspondent's questions. 
  [Kononenko] Georgiy Aleksandrovich, does it surprise you 
that only three factions in the State Duma as of today support 
the treaty, or do you accept it as logical? 
  [Satarov] It is not surprising in the least. The opponents 
of this document advance no convincing arguments, but they do 
uphold their own political interests. In other words, it is a 
matter not of the document's contents but of the factions' 
attitudes. Just take a look at the similar theses of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and the Communists! 
They say: This agreement represents the preservation of the 
present regime until the elections. In the language of 
political scientists this means: It is possible to fight for 
power right now -- therefore, we will fight for power. 
  [Kononenko] But perhaps these factions' proposals were not 
taken into consideration? 
  [Satarov] They were all initially agreed on the following 
approach: No proposals should impinge on the sides' 
constitutional powers. The LDPR representatives' demand for the 
removal of six ministers from the government, for example, 
impinges on the executive's constitutional powers. Therefore 
they cannot be a subject for discussion. 
  [Kononenko] What is the assumed list of participants in the 
treaty? 
  [Satarov] It will evidently be signed by the president, the 
prime minister, the patriarch of All Rus and the leaders of 
other religions creeds, the leaders of factions and the main 
trade union organizations and regions, and so forth. 
  [Kononenko] What is the mood in the regions? 
  [Satarov] Judging by the information arriving from the 
regions, no one disagrees with the document. There is a 
readiness to sign it without criticism and with the 
corresponding proposals. These proposals have already been 
received by the working group. I have not come across anything 
unacceptable in them. 
  [Kononenko] Can attacks be expected on those who do not give 
their signatures to this treaty? 
  [Satarov] No one intends to declare them "enemies of the 
people." Everyone still has a chance to accede to this document.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] The idea of civic accord has become nearly an 
obsession in our society but so far none of the politicians and 
leaders of different factions have shown particular enthusiasm 
about the forthcoming signing of that document, which is to take 
place on 28 April in the St. George Hall in the Kremlin. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent T. Aldoshina] Representatives of political 
parties and public movements will be given air time and, with 
it, an opportunity to make their opinion known to the people - 
especially on the eve of the signing of the civic accord 
agreement. Their right to do this is guaranteed by a 
presidential decree. Its existence became known at today's 
meeting of Boris Yeltsin with representatives of the factions of 
the State Duma. This concession to the parties' demands was 
made by the president in order to confirm that there are 
alternatives to extremism and confrontation in Russia. The 
obligations proclaimed by those who are going to sign the 
agreement contain a hope for successful implementation of the 
idea of civic peace. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] We are talking not about an 
ordinary compromise. It is capable of saving Russia at the 
present stage. At the same time, the participants in the 
agreement are by no means renouncing their convictions, 
programs, and platforms - there is no need for that. On the 
contrary, one of the aims of the agreement is to offer to all 
political forces peaceful, non-violent ways of achieving their 
goals. [end recording] 
  [Aldoshina] Yeltsin aide Georgiy Satarov has described the 
attitudes of the faction leaders to the idea of an all-saving 
compromise, namely civic accord. In his opinion, virtually all 
of those present at today's meeting with the president spoke in 
favor of signing the agreement. The ubiquitous Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy was the first to support the president. The 
Agrarians and Communists are also for it on the whole but they 
have certain conditions, so it is not yet clear if they will 
join the agreement together with the main group of signatories. 
The Yabloko bloc was the only one to speak categorically 
against signing it, in the sense that Yabloko is ready to do all 
it can for the idea of civic peace and accord but does not 
intend to sign any declarations.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- Russia's decision to 
integrate its monetary system with Belarussia's should not have 
any effect on the inflation rate of the rouble until at least 
this summer, announced Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin in 
an interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday. He was commenting on an 
International Monetary Fund statement that a new "spiral of 
inflation" was to be expected in Russia. 
  Only the trade and economic integration of the two states 
has 
begun at present, in accordance with the recently-signed 
agreement on monetary union, Shokhin said. The circulation of 
the rouble on Belarussian territory needs to be approved by the 
parliament since it requires changes in that country's 
constitution, and that takes time, he noted. 
  The vice-premier said that the agreement on monetary union 
was only "partly" signed on April 12. The deal is, he 
explained, that the agreement's articles which were connected 
with commercial and economic cooperation were to go in effect 
immediately after preparation was completed. These concerned, 
in particular, the removal of customs barriers and the 
conclusion of a transit agreement. But it was decided that the 
other, monetary part of the document was to become effective 
only after its legalization in Belarus, since the creation of a 
single centre of emission in Russia contradicts the Belarussian 
Constitution. 
  If the Belarussian legislation is changed in accordance with 
the documents signed in Moscow, then it will be the Russian 
State Duma's turn to examine the benefits of monetary union with 
Belarus. 
  If Belarus is not willing to accept a single emission centre 
in Russia, then there are no chances that Russia will agree to a 
one- to-one exchange of Belarussian notes for Russian roubles, 
Shokhin explained. In that case, Russia will have to follow a 
different unification scheme, by extending credit to Belarus on 
the same grounds as it was given to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan at 
the end of 1993.

  [Text] Bishkek 24 April TASS -- Chinese State Council 
Premier Li Peng, currently on an official visit to the Central 
Asian state of Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], said after talks with 
President Askar Akayev that China did not seek to fill a sort of 
vacuum in the wake of the former Soviet Union's collapse, and 
intended to oppose any form of chauvinism. 
  In his turn, the Kirgiz president said the current visit by 
the Chinese State Council premier to Bishkek was to open good 
prospects for the Republic. 
  As concerns issues of border territories, the two leaders 
noted they would be solved in the spirit of mutual understanding 
and good-neighbourly relations. Expressing sympathy with the 
Kirgiz people that suffered greatly in recent natural 
calamities, China intends to provide humanitarian aid to the 
Republic and a 50 mln yuans credit. 
  On Sunday, the Chinese premier had a rest on Kirgizia's 
famous lake Issyk-Kul. 
  Li Peng is to return to the Kirgiz capital tomorrow and 
visit 
the Chinese Embassy. He will go to the airport at 1530 to fly 
off to Alma-Ata [Almaty].

  [Text] Ashkhabad 22 April TASS -- Turkmenistan will export 
its gas with China's and Japan's help. A preliminary agreement 
was reached on this score here today between the Turkmenian 
Ministry for Petroleum and Gas and officials of the Chinese 
National Oil Corporation, accompanying Li Peng, premier of the 
PRC State Council, in his 12-day tour of four Central Asian 
countries-members of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS). 
  China undertakes to build the necessary pipeline, says the 
bilateral protocol of intent. A commission, including 
Turkmenian, Chinese and Japanese experts, will be set up shortly 
to draw up the project, the document notes. 
  The question of building an Asian super-pipeline was raised 
during Turkmenian President Saparmurad Niyazov's visit to China 
in November 1992. 
  Representatives of Turkmenian and Chinese business circles 
have also concluded an agreement to deliver 20,000 tonnes of 
cotton to China, to promote contacts between the Chambers of 
Commerce of the two countries, to supply to Turkmenistan 
Chinese-made electrical household appliances, and to build 
steel-smelting and aluminium plants.

  [Text] Baku, 22 Apr -- The new Russian draft plan for 
solving the armed Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict and the 
transition to eliminating its consequences "is not acceptable to 
the Azerbaijan side." This is the opinion of the members of the 
National Assembly (parliament) of Azerbaijan who examined the 
draft plan this evening. 
  Although the issue was not included on the agenda, it was 
proposed to National Assembly Speaker Rasul Guliyev that it 
should be discussed. The latter had stressed that "it was not a 
question of adopting any kind of specific decision, but of the 
deputies expressing their attitude to the new Russian 
initiatives." In the opinion of the absolute majority of 
parliamentarians, "the interests of Azerbaijan were not 
reflected" in them. In the view of the deputies, the adoption 
of the draft plan "would in fact set the seal on the occupation 
of the lands captured earlier by the Armenian side, and would 
mean a loss of 35 percent of the republic's territory." It is 
known that at the present time the Armenian armed formations are 
in control of 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. 
  At the same time, it is stressed at the session, that such a 
stand by the National Assembly "by no means signifies that the 
National Assembly is opposed to a peaceful solution to this 
problem." The parliamentarians believe that "the Azerbaijani 
side should draw up an alternative draft plan for a settlement 
of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict and submit it to its Russian 
mediators." 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Azerbaijan has been charged 
with doing this. Hasan Hasanov, the head of the republic's 
foreign policy department, himself thinks that "without 
rejecting the Russian draft, they should work on it to make it 
correspond to the national interests of Azerbaijan." 
  A number of parliamentarians have expressed the view that it 
is necessary to return to the "tripartite initiative" variant 
that envisages Russia, the United States, and Turkey 
participating as mediators, which would allow a mutually 
acceptable variant to be found for settling the conflict 
surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. They also think that 
disengagement forces should operate with a UN mandate.

  [Text] During their talks in Geneva, the Georgian and 
Abkhaz delegations "adopted mutually exclusive positions, 
backing farther away from the commitments they signed in the 
political declaration of 4 April." Feliks Kovalev, the roving 
ambassador who is heading the Russian delegation, said this in 
an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. Summing up the 
results of the Geneva round, he disclosed that, on behalf of the 
United Nations and the Russian Federation, "options for a 
compromise were proposed, and the parties expressed readiness, 
in essence, to adopt them as a basis for further discussions." 
"The next session will be held in Moscow on 10 May, and we may 
be able to make a little more progress there than we have 
managed on this occasion." 
  Two documents proposed by the mediators will be discussed at 
the meeting in the Russian capital. The first deals with 
"political and legal elements of a comprehensive settlement of 
the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict." The second concerns "proposals 
on the establishment of a coordinating commission." The 
documents were jointly prepared by UN and Russian diplomats. 
Kovalev said that the Russian delegation "made a substantial 
contribution." 
  Is there any chance the two sides will reach an agreement? 
"It is very difficult to answer this question," F. Kovalev 
noted. "Judging by their drafts, they have not budged from their 
original positions. In fact, they are going backward rather than 
forward." The main problem is connected with Abkhazia's 
political status. "One side wants to regard itself as an 
independent state entering into a treaty relationship with 
another state. That is the Abkhazian starting point. The 
starting point of the Georgians is to keep everything roughly as 
it was before the conflict started," the diplomat said. 
  The United Nations and Russia are proposing a "union state." 
Their proposals also say that the parties recognize the 
territorial integrity of the entity they might establish as a 
result of the talks, Kovalev concluded.

<F P=106> ["At the Crossroads of Opinion" live phone-in with Ukrainian </F>
President Leonid Kravchuk, moderated by Viktoriya Popovych and 
Vadym Zadorozhnyy] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
  [Popovych] We will begin our conversation with the president 
by analyzing the economic situation in Ukraine, for the economic 
situation directly affects the political situation in our state. 
And so, Leonid Makarovych, the state of Ukraine's economy at the 
moment when it acquired independence and today, and the 
objective and subjective factors, which have affected and are 
affecting our economy, please. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, if one is to compare the figures, then 
naturally the state of the economy on the day of independence 
was better than today. But those were different economies -- 
the one on the day of independence and today's economy. There 
was the economy of the post-Soviet period. It has not exhausted 
precisely these features even now. 
  But the shoots of a new economy, a market economy, are now 
beginning to appear. They are appearing everywhere -- in 
industry, in the agrarian sector, in construction. That is, a 
new structure is now emerging. Proprietors are emerging. And 
the reform of the economy into a market one is proceeding 
gradually. It is difficult, but it is proceeding. Naturally 
this process of transition from one economy to another one 
cannot be painless or easy, therefore, the level of the decline 
of production naturally is great, that is, if one is to look 
only at the process. 
  But there are subjective factors, as you rightly say. These 
are Ukraine's great dependence on energy-carriers, which have 
increased by tens, hundreds, thousands of times recently, I mean 
the prices. There is the problem of management. There is the 
problem of personnel. There is the problem of the purely 
functional dependence of our economy on the economies of other 
states of the former Soviet Union. There are links that truly 
cannot be in the same mode as they were in before. They should 
change. They should improve. They should acquire an entirely 
different substance and nature, not centralized or 
administrative, but namely the search for the best paths, the 
best way out of the situation. 
  And we already see, although it is too early yet to speak of 
some sort of successes, but there are already, well, say, some 
kind of healthy processes too. The rate of inflation has 
decreased. Even the price of the consumer basket has decreased 
somewhat. That is, well, there are complex processes proceeding 
in parallel with the birth of the new. This is the singularity 
we have today. 
  [Popovych] Yes, Supreme Council chairman Ivan Plyushch gave 
these figures at the final sitting yesterday. He gave them and 
spoke of the decline in production too. He cited (?43) percent 
and at the same time these positive points -- the increase in 
the containment of hyperinflation from (?191) percent in 
December of last year to (?5.7) percent in March this year. 
Retail prices --we have noticed this too -- have not been 
rising recently, and have been decreasing for some goods. And 
this is the question: Can one explain this by the fact that the 
deputies of the previous convocation were busy with the election 
campaign, did not assemble for plenary sittings, while the 
government and the president had the chance to work and conduct 
measures planned by themselves, and there was no one to block 
them? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I would not say this, but one thing that is 
well-known: that when the parliament is engaged in its affair, 
the government in its affair and the president in his affair, 
that is not verbally, but realistically, [words indistinct], the 
result is better, and there is no doubt that when deputies 
assemble, say, or assembled, instead of elaborating normal, 
(?say) necessary laws, legislative acts, normative acts, were 
reduced to hearing about and studying, say, the situation, and 
it was difficult to take realistic steps to improve the 
situation -- this was (?not) reflected in the government's work, 
undoubtedly, but I cannot say this was the result of the Supreme 
Council not assembling. 
  [Passage omitted] 
I can stress that the vigor, purposefulness, and energy of the 
government administrative structures are now directed precisely 
at overcoming the economic crisis. This is true. 
  [Popovych] Please tell us, then, does this period of 
stabilization -- the beginning of stabilization -- signify that 
Ukraine is now approaching the peak, the culmination, and that a 
levelling out will begin now, that we will go up? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I would like to think, just like you, and I 
hope that it will happen namely like this, if we do not shake 
up, say, the political situation in the country, if we do not 
stir up differences, if that for which we are calling all the 
time, both the Supreme Council and the president -- for national 
accord, for civic reconciliation, for unity around lofty aims, 
around lofty tasks -- statehood, independence, the market 
economy, democracy -- if we have all this, then I hope that the 
next parliament, which will assemble with these tasks, and if we 
all work, work together energetically, then this beginning can 
then become some kind of course, some kind of stable course 
towards overcoming the crisis. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] So that you can again convince us, and 
possibly 
our listeners, that this stabilization is nevertheless an 
objective process and, thanks to the efforts of our government 
officials, deny this assertion by some specialists, who believe 
that the containment of inflation is a consequence of 
nonpayments, that is neither the producers or consumers have any 
money, and that a new inflationary spiral supposedly awaits us 
in the middle of May when the monetary printing press will be 
started up again, and another monetary emission will take place. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, you know, here one has to take account of 
the fact that money is not given, but earned. I know that many 
producers are making their products for the warehouse. There 
are trillions of karbovantsi worth of products in warehouses at 
present. [passage omitted] 
  But if a commodity is needed, if a cheap quality product is 
made, then it will always find a consumer in a market 
environment. Therefore, money cannot be issued for, say, 
unearned goods, unfinished (?poor-quality) goods. Then it is 
clear that the monetary and payments crisis is also explained by 
the fact that namely these market mechanisms have not been 
elaborated yet -- demand, the consumer's possibilities, the 
producer's possibilities, the production structure, the 
consumption structure, the balance of payments, the cash 
possibilities of Ukraine and directly of consumers, and 
producers, I mean producers and consumers as people who consume 
food products, for example, every day, or other domestic 
products. Time is needed for all of this. Therefore, clearly 
if some people want to throw unearned money into production, or 
into indexation, or to add trillions to circulating assets, then 
clearly inflation will creep upwards, because there can only be 
and should only be as much money as goods produced. 
  [Popovych] Leonid Makarovych, tell us, please, some people 
in Ukraine, most of all, for example, members of the 
Hrynyov-Kuchma Interregional Bloc of Reforms assert that all our 
economic setbacks can only be overcome by renewing economic ties 
with Russia. But will the unification of two exhausted paupers 
do much good? For example, we know it from the Ostankino TV 
programs that large enterprises are coming to a halt in Russia, 
such as ZIL [Likhachev automobile works], a large harvester 
plant was mentioned, oil wells are standing idle, andmachinery 
does not go to the fields. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] In the same manner, they are not paying 
producers. 
  [Popovych] People are failing to receive their wages for 
several months. So how shall we unite and renew these 
relations? What will they give us? 
  [Kravchuk] Here we should look at the problem as follows: 
the 
production and market relations within the framework of the CIS 
are necessary and I do not want anyone to doubt this. They are 
necessary, because the CIS market is so far a determining market 
for us. Not the European market, but CIS. We have not yet 
approached the European market and have not entered it 
seriously, structurally. Although, steps have been made, and 
what is more, significant steps. However, when they talk about 
renewing ties, there is a detail which needs to be explained. I 
can show it to you on one example only. 
  There is a missile-carrying ship in Nikolayev called the 
Varyah. As far as I remember, approximately more than 1,500 
enterprises of the former USSR were building it, I have in mind 
its components. Now, when we offered Russia to renew the 
construction of this ship and then dispose of it appropriately, 
this has already become impossible for objective reasons, 
because as many as nearly 500 enterprises, which had been 
earlier working for this ship, ceased to exist as such. And the 
same happens in every industry. 
  Rather complicated processes are under way. Enterprises are 
being closed down, new enterprises and production shops, which 
manufacture new products, are commissioned. Then how can we 
renew in full measure the ties without taking into account the 
situation which has already taken shape. If someone wants to 
renew the ties in full measure, this means to renew the Soviet 
Union in full measure, to renew the planned-centralized economy 
in full measure, in other words, to renew everything as it was 
before. But this is just impracticable. This is why I am 
talking not about the renewal but about the development and 
expansion of ties on the new principles, in accordance with the 
market situation. Because, if Russia goes further on along the 
road of market and we will be lagging behind, it will become 
just impossible to renew these ties on the new principles. 
  I am speaking not only about Russia, but about other 
countries as well. That is to say, one should approach this 
issue in concrete, not general terms. If the idea is to 
establish economic ties of the new nature and new systems, I 
fully support exactly these ties. 
  As for the developments in Russia, you see, the situation is 
complicated everywhere -- in Russia, in Belarus, and in Ukraine 
-- because the entire economy is being reformed and its 
structure altered. Complicated processes are under way. 
Someone makes it better and someone makes it less good, 
however, everywhere difficulties are of a broad-scale nature. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] It happened that there is competition between 
Ukraine and Russia, in terms of comparisons. 
  But we have already touched upon the issue of the CIS. On 15 
April in Moscow, Ukraine acceded to the CIS economic union as an 
associate member and signed all the economic agreements. 
  Mykola Riznyk from Australia wants to know the difference 
between an associate and full member of the economic union. Is 
the associate membership of Ukraine in CIS fraught with danger 
to Ukraine's independence? 
  [Kravchuk] I will give only one example to answer Mykola 
Riznyk. 
  The treaty on the economic union emphasizes that the full 
members of the economic union cannot accede to other unions. As 
far as the associate members, they can do so. In other words, 
Ukraine, in this particular case, is free to accede to the 
European Union as well, if it is ready for this. By the way, an 
associate member has more freedom of action and more 
opportunities as far as international relations with other 
countries are concerned. But it also has every opportunity to 
participate, as fully as possible, within the framework of the 
economic union. 
  [Popovych] Mr. President, tell me, what advantage does 
Ukraine have or will it have from being a member of the CIS, 
from the agreements that have been signed? For example, any 
commonwealth envisages that its members have certain concessions 
and advantages. It seems that the CIS does not have this, 
because if one takes into account the fact that Russia sells us 
energy sources at the highest world prices... 
  [Kravchuk, interrupting] This is an interesting question. It 
is fairly apt. For example, for there to be competition within 
the framework of the CIS and for there to be normal conditions, 
producers should have identical conditions. If, say, a Russian 
producer buys energy soruces twice as cheaply as a Ukrainian 
one, then what kind of a free, let us say, free CIS market, with 
competition on equal terms, can one speak of? This is difficult. 
  Let us say the same about free trade. It is free when there 
are no restrictions. But for the time being, Russia has made 
certain exceptions for itself, for its goods, say, in the 
document, which we have signed, although it will not come into 
force tomorrow. And this concerns primarily energy soruces. 
Thus trade is sort of free, but with certain reservations and 
certain exceptions. So, this is right. 
  Take the European Union. There they watch pricing, quotas, 
customs duties, and such things very closely so that one country 
does not experience losses from a market that is not regulated 
or coordinated with other countries. We do not have this yet. 
This is the main reason for all of these complexities that we 
have in trade, in settlements, and so on. [passage omitted] 
  [Popovych] Let us return to the issue of the CIS. Mr. 
President, the CIS' acquisition of observer status at the United 
Nations, the desire to acquire this status at the CSCE, the 
endorsement of a CIS flag and emblem, to me these are all signs 
of the creation of a state, which, in addition, is, as before, 
under the aegis of Russia, because Russian representatives 
occupy almost all of the leading posts in CIS structures, and 
Russia will continue to be in the chair at sittings until the 
end of the year. Is this not so? Is this the revival of the 
old empire or the creation of a new empire with the economic 
union being used a means to bring CIS countries into this 
process? Belarus has already made a step into Russia's embrace. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, the European Union also has its parliament. 
It has its flag, it has its emblem. It even has certain 
executive structures. And it does not evoke any doubt in anyone 
that it is some kind of empire or suprastate. This is not the 
only point. The point is something else: that only independent 
states with all of the institutions and attributes of statehood 
-- a currency, a financial and banking system, institutions of 
power, troops, everything of its own that it can have -- should 
enter a union, any union. And then this problem does not arise. 
  As far as Belarus is concerned, there is another problem 
here. Belarus is already going beyond the feature that the 
European Union has -- yes, they are going toward the ECU there, 
but for the moment each country has its own currency. This is 
the main thing in economic independence. Their currencies unite 
Belarus with Russia. Then the problem of integration is 
considerably deeper. It is so deep that it can then turn into 
some kind of political, let us say, integrational processes. 
But this is then the affair of Russia and Belarus. This is 
their affair. 
  Ukraine occupies a different position. We occupy the 
position that every state should have all of the attributes of 
statehood both in the economy and in policy -- in military 
policy and in international policy. This is the most important 
thing. And if we have this, if there are no encroachments from 
anyone on these institutions, then one can enter any union and 
have any pennants, any flags. They are not state ones. 
Incidentally, no one endorsed them. They were simply looked at 
and approved. There was no endorsement and no one put their 
signatures to this. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] And in the context of the question put by 
Viktoriya, the question about unions, what is your attitude to 
the idea of Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev of creating a 
Eurasian union? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this is a continuation of the subject. 
Clearly, Nazarbayev and many leaders of CIS states have a 
problem with the effectiveness of CIS work. Frankly, We see 
that it works with a very low coefficient of usefulness. 
Although I have insisted and insist that it is fulfilling its 
role, and I am convinced that without the CIS resolving 
interstate and internal state problems would be even worse. 
This is a fact. 
  So, each has ideas about searching for a more effective 
system. Well, Nazarbayev proposed a Eurasian union. This is 
the outline of, let us say, the European Union, and I am saying 
that I do not see any, well, complexities in being able to draw 
nearer to a closer economic union. This is very important. I 
am speaking about economic integration. I am not talking about 
political integration, but for this, it is necessary to draw 
nearer. It is necessary for the conditions to evolve. 
  For example, we cannot become a full-fledged member of the 
European Union at the moment, because neither our economy nor 
our domestic and other problems are ready to enter into 
cooperation with them. This is simply unrealistic, and at 
present, the Eurasian union is simply an idea, but its 
implementation is simply unrealistic at present. The right 
conditions have not evolved for this. That is, one has to 
proceed by stages. 
  I have said several times and am saying again that Europe 
was 
going toward the European Union for more than 35 years after the 
Rome sitting, in 1957 I think. This is how long it took for you 
to come to the creation of the European Union. And now take a 
look at the plan for it. With what tolerance, with what 
respect, with the confirmation of legal, international and other 
(?norms) this is being carried out, by means of polls, 
referendums, and so on. One cannot think thus: heads of state 
assemble, sign, and then there is a Eurasian or some other kind 
of union. One has to move toward this. 
  [Popovych] Well, returning to the issue of flags and 
emblems, 
I think that we have already replied to Mr. Oleh Antonyuk from 
London, Great Britain. Because he is asking: if Ukraine is an 
associate member, then what are flags, emblems, joint borders 
and their protection, a joint command, doing there -- everything 
is there, and God knows what else that we do not know about, but 
it has already been written down and signed by you. He is 
addressing you here. 
  [Kravchuk] We did not say anything about flags. Neither did 
we talk about joint borders. We talked only about joint 
protection of borders. That is, where there are borders, for 
example, between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, we signed a 
declaration, a document, on cooperation between our border 
troops to protect the borders, and not on joint borders. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] I think that Boris Yeltsin [word indistinct] 
at 
a news conference, perhaps mistakenly. He said that namely 
joint borders had been agreed on. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, it was probably a mistake. The document 
says that the three of us -- Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus -- 
signed a declaration -- what is it called -- a memorandum on 
joint protection of common borders -- that is, common ones where 
we come into contact with each other and not joint ones as such. 
For example, the border between Ukraine and Russia. It is a 
common border for the two of us. This means that its joint 
protection is the cooperation of border troops, and not that 
there is no Ukrainian border at all or there is no Russian or 
Belarusian border. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] Mr. President, another listener wants to put a 
question to you. We are listening. Speak, please. 
  [Sayuk] Yuriy Sayuk from Bavaria speaking. Mr. President, I 
have two questions. The first question: the existence of the 
state of Ukraine depends on energy resources. However, the 
terminal has not been built yet, the Arab and Iranian 
possibilities have not been fulfilled. [words indistinct] 
(?helplessness). This is the first question. 
  The second question concerns [passage indistinct]. Esteemed 
Leonid Makarovych, I would like your guidance. Where is the 
limit to accommodation? You have already partly touched on the 
matter. But I am interested in the issue of joint 
communications, joint citizenship, language, and suprastate 
structures. And another thing, has the older brother [Russia] 
in the friendship of peoples, and Slavic ones too, handed over 
anything from joint property abroad for Ukraine's embassies and 
missions yet? Thank you for your attention. 
  [Kravchuk] With regard to the terminal, this issue has 
already been presented for practical resolution. There are 
firms ready to begin implementing it. And we are also 
conducting business talks with Turkey on constructing part of a 
pipeline, approximately 300 kilometers long, which should 
transport, say, some part, some amount I would say, of oil and 
energy sources to Ukraine, to the Black Sea, and maybe to 
Europe. So this issue is being resolved. 
  I would simply like to remind you that issues of such a 
large 
scale, which you mentioned, are not resolved so easily, 
especially as Ukraine does not have its own currency [as heard]. 
It has to search for such firms and forms of cooperation so as 
to attract funds from elsewhere. One has to bear this in mind, 
because our desires and our possibilities very often do not 
coincide. 
  Now, regarding the older brother. There is a certain 
exaggeration. I have said and say that fate has dealt with us 
in such a way that we live in friendship and equal partnership 
with Russia. History has not given us another way, because to 
have such a large neighbor and not to find cooperation with him, 
not to find accord with him, not to find understanding with him 
on any issues, equality above all, I stress, partnership, would 
constantly threaten Ukraine's statehood and independence. We, 
you, are doomed by history to act namely thus. If someone 
thinks that there is another way, exacerbation of the situation 
with Russia, this way will not lead to the normal development of 
Ukraine, and not only Ukraine. It is even about wider problems, 
problems of a European and world scale. That is why we will act 
precisely in this way. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] Mr. President, Mr. Yuriy Sayuk also had a 
question concerning the Arab-Iranian agreement and the former 
USSR property abroad. But, please, be brief because other 
listeners are waiting. 
  [Kravchuk] There are examples. I am just not ready now to 
speak from memory. I did not know what questions I would have 
to answer. There are examples of Russia enabling us to use the 
premises abroad for our embassies and consulates. Of course, we 
make appropriate payments for the rent. This is true. However, 
at the official level, let us say, at the interstate level, this 
issue has not yet been solved. There are many problems here. 
  As far as the Arab project is concerned, I have already said 
that we link all the issues pertaining to the construction of 
the oil pipeline with Turkey. [passage omitted: caller from UK 
asks whether people of Ukrainian descent who live in the UK have 
the right to Ukrainian citizenship. Kravchuk explains that only 
persons who arrive in Ukraine for permanent residence can obtain 
Ukrainian citizenship] 
  [U.S. caller Filimonchuk] Highly esteemed Mr. President, I 
have three questions. The first one is this: It was a fatal 
mistake to recognize Crimea, to grant Crimea autonomy. How is 
Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine going to get out of that 
situation [words indistinct]? 
  The second question: Why was former Defense Minister 
Kostyantyn Morozov dismissed? Why was he not appointed to the 
post of prime minister? 
  The third question: Why is Ukraine procrastinating with the 
introduction of the hryvna into the Ukrainian monetary system? 
Thanks. 
  [Kravchuk] As far as the autonomy of Crimea is concerned, if 
we regard ourselves as a democratic and law-governed state, then 
the expression of people's will is a norm for all the civilized 
states as far as their desire to have any structure is concerned. 
  A referendum was held in Crimea that showed that the 
majority 
of the population of Crimea expressed its will that Crimea 
should become an autonomous republic. This is the first thing. 
The second thing is that the decision was made at the time when 
the Soviet Union was still in existence. If we, for example, 
had ignored the will of the people of Crimea, something 
different could have happened. The USSR Supreme Soviet and the 
USSR Congress of People's Deputies could have solved this issue 
without any, let us say, major consent on the part of Ukraine. 
The USSR, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were still in 
existence then, and you know how things were done then. Then we 
could have lost Crimea, let us say, as a result of a decision by 
the USSR Supreme Soviet which was empowered to solve these 
issues. If, for example, any documents were required on the 
part of Russia and Ukraine, these could become available because 
at that time, I repeat this, there was no independent state 
here, at that time it was still the USSR. 
  As far as Kostyantyn Morozov is concerned, this is the post 
which is approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. I 
submitted Morozov's candidacy request to the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine to be appointed defense minister. However, Kostyantyn 
Morozov came to me and asked me to withdraw his candidature for 
the post of defense minister. He explained this by the fact 
that the Supreme Council would not support him. Therefore, I 
withdrew his candidature at his own request. 
  Third, as far as the hryvna is concerned, a stabilization 
fund is required to introduce the hryvna. At present, we are 
carrying out intensive, active work with the IMF and with the 
World Bank so that they would give us a stabilization currency 
fund for the introduction of the hryvna. If such a fund becomes 
available we shall be able to introduce the hryvna with the hope 
of real success and without apprehension of possible inflation. 
If there is no stabilization fund...[pauses] and inflation may 
lead to great damage, to grave losses, and to removing strong, 
authoritative currency -- the Ukrainian hryvna -- from the 
agenda. 
  [Belgian caller Omelyan Koval] [passage omitted] My second 
question deals with the sovereignty of Ukraine and the 
inviolability of its territory stemming from international 
agreements. It is known that Russia is trying to keep the 
Crimean shores for its Black Sea Fleet. How does this conform 
with the principle of independence of the state and 
inviolability of its borders? 
  The third issue deals with foreign trade and export of state 
and private property worth billions of dollars beyond the 
borders of Ukraine at a time when only a small part of its value 
returns to Ukraine, and the rest is replenishing private bank 
accounts. What has been done by the government to make these 
billions return to Ukraine and help stabilize its own currency 
and its convertibility? 
  [Kravchuk] [Passage omitted] Concerning the Russian Black 
Sea 
Fleet in Crimea and how this conforms with Ukraine's 
sovereignty: Well, you see, there are two aspects of this 
problem. There were many countries where the U.S. Navy was 
based; however, this did not endanger the sovereignty of the 
countries concerned. This is the first thing. 
  Second. We should take realities into account. If Russia 
has relevant bases today for its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, 
Sevastopol, and so on, one cannot make Russia leave these bases 
by force. We have to agree with Russia by signing relevant 
agreements, relevant documents which would deal with the 
leasing, let us say, of the bases on the territory of Crimea for 
a certain period of time, until this issue is solved on a 
widescale basis. That is to say, I would not like this to be 
closely linked with sovereignty. The main thing is how to solve 
the issue, on what principles. Second, is there a possibility 
today of solving this issue any other way? I, for example, do 
not see such a way. Those who think that it can be solved by 
means of, let us say, diktat or the use of any sanctions or 
force must see that this is impracticable today. We have to 
solve this issue in accordance with realities. 
  On foreign trade, you are right to say that part of the 
money, I just do not know what part -- unfortunately I do not 
have the figures which are available to you -- billions or any 
other figure -- but I also know that part of the money fails to 
return to Ukraine. There are two ways here: an administrative 
one, that is, the implementation of such measures as, let us 
say, blocking the borders, perhaps, to take some other measures 
-- however, in a democratic society this way is doomed to 
failure, after all -- and another way is to create prerequisites 
in Ukraine for investments. When we have convertible currency, 
when we have the right conditions for investment, when we have 
the right conditions for trade, the commodity producers or 
private individuals will have no desire to transfer money from 
Ukraine, but will be interested in investing the money in 
Ukraine, because here it will give better results and yield 
higher profits. That is to say, we must approach the situation 
in exactly this way. We are moving in this direction step by 
step. [passage omitted on use of Ukrainian language in 
parliament] 
  [U.S. caller Stovbunenko] [Passage omitted] Will Ukraine 
reserve the right to have its own nuclear weapons for 
self-defense? 
  [Kravchuk] [passage omitted] As far as nuclear weapons are 
concerned, I would like you to understand that today Ukraine 
cannot maintain nuclear weapons for objective, subjective and 
any other reasons. It inherited these nuclear weapons, although 
it has neither scientific nor technical servicing ... [pauses] 
Ukraine has no structures whatsoever to manufacture, service, 
and equip nuclear weapons. This is why nuclear weapons here in 
Ukraine could even endanger Ukraine itself, and not only 
Ukraine, rather than protect it, if there is no possibility to 
maintain, equip, service, test and manufacture them. 
  In this case this is a dangerous weapon on the territory of 
the state and we proceed exactly from this fact. Meanwhile, to 
build all this Ukraine would need hundreds of -- I emphasize 
this -- billions of dollars. And we are now looking for at 
least one billion. This is why we are acting in line with our 
possibilities. But this does not mean that we are not looking 
for the other ways toward consolidating defense capacity and 
ways to use such a weapon which will be highly effective, 
although non-nuclear. Like all other countries we are looking 
for exactly these ways. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] [Passage omitted] Of late, there has been a 
tendency for the left- wing forces to return to power in 
countries where parliamentary elections have been held. Ukraine 
has not been an exception. However, if the return of the 
left-wingers in other states means, well, a change in the 
economy or in foreign policy, Ukraine may even face the danger 
of losing its independence. 
  As has been reported, in the near future you are supposed to 
meet Petro Symonenko, the leader of the Ukrainian communists. 
What are you going to clear up first and foremost during this 
meeting? 
  [Kravchuk] I have already met Petro Symonenko. We discussed 
issues of interest, it seems to me, for both the left-wingers 
and the right-wingers and for the centrists; in other words, 
issues of our state's independence, development of market 
relations, development of normal, goodneighborly relations with 
the CIS countries, and not only the CIS countries. In other 
words, we discussed a whole range of issues. 
  It seems to me that the communist leader understands the 
situation and I did not feel, I say this sincerely, that he had 
any thought of casting doubt on the independence of our Ukraine. 
He doubts the way toward, let us say, this independence. This 
is connected, above all, with the economy and with the social 
protection of people. This was the keynote. I put questions 
straightforwardly to receive straightforward answers. If they 
are sincere, well, I hope they are, there was no indication that 
the left-wing forces in parliament would immediately raise the 
question of Ukraine's independence or dependence, or whatever 
you may call it. It is impossible today to assess the 
left-wingers in a negative way only and, let us say, the 
right-wingers in a positive way only. The left-wingers are not a 
homogeneous mass, excuse me for the word mass, the same as the 
right-wingers. Life is much more complicated than just 
labelling this or that deputy either a left-winger or a 
right-winger. [passage omitted] 
  [Popovych] Mr. President, I will put several questions all 
at once, as a listener has now broached this subject. We have 
had very many calls to the editorial office during the week, 
ahead of this program, on this subject -- that is, presidential 
elections. The first question I will put to you is: Are you 
thinking of putting forward your candidacy for president for the 
next term? That question is from Vasyl Semak from England. He 
also expressed the view that presidential elections should not 
be allowed this year at any cost, because, according to him, 
Kuchma will get in and it will be worse. Vasyl Semak from 
England thinks this. Also Mykola Lazarenko from England. 
Highly esteemed Mr. President, can a person with a very limited 
knowledge of the Ukrainian language be nominated as candidate 
for president of Ukraine -- I mean Leonid Kuchma. If in mockery 
of the Ukrainian nation a Russian-speaking president is elected, 
then is there a danger that he will appeal to his northern 
fellow Russian-speakers to defend him. 
  Vyacheslav Dymovyy, a lawyer from Moscow and a Ukrainian. 
This is a slightly different question. Mr. Kravchuk, do you 
accept the appearance of Kuchma as your mistake? Is Kravchuk 
intending to bear responsibility for the fact that he will leave 
the post of president without a struggle? [passage omitted] 
  [Zadorozhnyy] To complete this group of questions, for the 
listeners are listening, they put questions to us before the 
program, and naturally they are checking to see if their 
questions are going to be heard. This is also on the same 
subject. This is from Vasyl Kucherenko, from Toronto, Canada. 
Mr. President, is it expedient at the current stage -- when 
Ukraine is only just becoming consolidated in the international 
arena, constructing its own policies and economy, resolving 
domestic and foreign issues and issues of the social system and 
government, forming a new multiparty parliament, and does not 
yet have a legal constitutional court or an approved basic law, 
Ukraine's constitution -- to elect a new president, spending a 
total of 1.618 trillion karbovantsi on this, plus 462-billion 
karbovantsi on run-off voting? Mr. President, you took upon 
yourself the heaviest burden and responsibility for the fate of 
independent Ukraine and of the Ukrainian people at the most 
difficult time for Ukraine, in December 1991. Can individual 
little groups, little parties, and collectives or associations 
decide whether to elect or not to elect a popular president? 
Only the whole Ukrainian people can elect you or show no 
confidence in you. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I want to answer briefly with certain 
theses. In Ukraine too at present there is also the opinion 
among deputies of all levels and among collectives that the 
election of a president at the present time is premature, (?but) 
no one is raising the issue of elections of a president in 
general, whether preterm or new elections, although our 
Constitution does not envisage preterm elections. The preterm 
suspension of powers following a referendum is envisaged. 
  But the new Supreme Council has to decide this. I am 
inclined to think that the Supreme Council cannot remain outside 
this important question. I have had meetings with deputies, 
with leaders of parties and forces, and have said that if the 
the old Supreme Council of that convocation adopted such a law 
under pressure of, say, and under certain conditions, then the 
new Supreme Council, which will take over responsibility for 
four years, should express its attitude, whether it confirms or 
whether it does something else. But it cannot remain outside 
this issue. 
  I have to appeal to the new Supreme Council with a request 
to 
express its attitude toward the election of both the president 
and local bodies of power. If the Supreme Council is inclined 
to this, well, it will be up to the Supreme Council. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] Do we understand that your stand concerning 
yourself as a candidate to run in the coming presidential 
election remains unchanged? 
  [Kravchuk] You see, if I join these election processes 
today, 
at once, without knowing the Supreme Council's clearly expressed 
opinion, this means that I am inclined to and I take part in 
the election which is not envisaged, let us say, in a 
full-fledged, full-blooded manner, either by the constitution or 
by all our legitimate laws. In other words, I cannot agree to 
this today. However, if the Supreme Council clearly expresses 
its opinion of the status and confirms, at least by 
constitutional majority, or simple majority or in any other way, 
its attitude toward this, then I will be able to say about this 
more distinctly. Now, at this stage, I cannot say anything 
else. [passage omitted on Moscow listener's comments 
establishing he is on air] 
  [Unidentified Moscow caller] I am very indignant at 
yesterday's statement on Ostankino television by Mr. Grachev 
regarding Ukraine's Navy and its location. I would like to hear 
from the president what his attitude to this is. 
  [Kravchuk] Regarding the issue with Russia, I cannot see any 
other way of reaching agreement than by adopting the principles 
of legality, recognized by the international community, and 
settling this issue. As for the details, they always 
are...[pauses] one side is saying one thing -- a Russian 
minister can say one thing and a Ukrainian one will tell you 
another, but this does not mean that what ministers are saying 
is objective truth, let us say, subject to no appeal, as this is 
a very complex and large-scale problem. We are to settle this 
issue conclusively with the president of Russia and the 
government of Russia, and this is what we shall do. 
  I would only like these problems not to be exacerbated 
prematurely on the basis of some preliminary talks and meetings 
between ministers and delegations or to be interpreted as the 
Ukrainian president's position. This is searching for ways, 
while the Ukrainian president has expressed his position. It is 
that we shall support Russia's interest in having a Russian 
naval base in Sevastopol. We shall back, shall we say, Russia's 
position on the use of the infrastructure that there is and the 
accords that exist between Ukraine and Russia -- the four 
documents signed in Yalta, Zavidovo and, let us say, Moscow and 
Massandra -- for everybody after all to get together and settle 
this issue. 
  However, no one -- neither Ukraine nor Russia -- can enforce 
diktat or a unilateral wish or unilateral advantages. This is a 
complex problem which should be tackled wisely and calmly in 
order not to fall out or conflict. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] In that case, can it be understood that the 
next stage of negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet and its 
division will now be tackled by both presidents directly, that 
of Ukraine and that of Russia? 
  [Kravchuk] At any rate, today I had a conversation with the 
leadership of Russia. I talked with Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin. I offered to meet him, now either at governmental 
or presidential level, with appropriate ministers and experts 
seated at our side, and make a decision, because this is the 
issue that will not be settled by ministers. This is to be 
settled by the presidents and governments. Documents and 
estimates, however, are of course to be produced by specialists, 
including military specialists, but this is not the issue that 
can be settled by military ministers. 
  I just would not like any, let us say, far-reaching 
conclusions to be made yet on the basis of the meeting in Crimea 
that was held. It was difficult, it was not easy and there is no 
need to investigate now who is right and who is not -- 
especially on the basis of speeches by ministers and their 
meetings with journalists. This, I would like to repeat, cannot 
be done. This is only searching for ways rather than resolving 
the problem conclusively. The final settlement of the issue is 
up to the presidents. 
  [Popovych] Mr. President, the situation has become so 
aggravated. Please tell us: Can such a situation arise -- I 
will repeat this -- in which Ukraine will have to turn to 
international organizations or seek participation of such 
countries as, for example, the United States of America in the 
solution of this issue? 
  By the way, there was a news item saying that the U.S. side 
expressed its readiness to help resolve the Crimean issue. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] [word indistinct] concerning nuclear 
disarmament. 
  [Kravchuk] This is a matter of a specific nature. Nuclear 
states.... [changes thought]. For example, why was the United 
States involved in this situation? Because an agreement on 
nuclear arms reduction was signed between the USSR and the 
United States of America. We also inherited the treaty that was 
signed, and we are now responsible for it. So, the 
participation of the United States here is logical, and not just 
logical but also concrete. 
  As far as the Black Sea Fleet is concerned, I believe we 
must 
resolve this issue with Russia, and I am convinced that we will 
resolve it. 
  [Zadorozhnyy] Were there any statements concerning a third 
party? Because a statement by President Boris Yeltsin's press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov has already become available to 
us. According to the statement, Yeltsin said the following, in 
particular: Russia will not allow any outside interference in 
the resolution of the Black Sea Fleet issue. 
  [Kravchuk] As far as I know, I have never said this 
anywhere; 
neither Yukhym Zvyahilskyy nor Ivan Plyushch have been saying 
this. Therefore, I do not know the source of this news. I have 
always said that there is a state policy, and there are opinions 
of certain political parties and forces. Therefore, if 
Zhirinovskiy says something, I will not refute him at the state 
level. I will, however, if Yeltsin says it. I have never said 
this, and I have never expressed myself in this connection. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Popovych] We have received another fax; this one is from 
Mykola Plavyuk. I do not think it is necessary to explain who 
Mykola Plavyuk is [former Ukrainian president in exile]. Does 
the (?experience) of the elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council 
help in completing work on Ukraine's constitution, and what are 
the prospects of the Cabinet of Ministers beginning real reform 
of Ukraine's economy in the very near future under your 
leadership? 
  [Kravchuk] With regard to the Constitution, I think that one 
will be able to speak of the new parliament's real possibilities 
for starting on the constitution after the additional elections 
to the Supreme Council have been held. At present, 338 deputies 
have been elected. It was said at the Supreme Council on 22 
April that the authorities of 335 deputies had been confirmed. 
This number of deputies is evidently insufficient for a 
constitutional majority, however; that is 300 votes. Therefore, 
to say now that the Supreme Council can start on the 
constitution immediately, before the additional deputies are 
elected, is impracticable. When a full-blooded parliament that 
represents all of Ukraine and all of its electors is elected, 
however, I believe that this is the largest and most important 
task--with which the old parliament did not manage to deal. 
This was the greatest fault in its work. 
  As far as the economy about which you speak is concerned, I 
already said something at the beginning of the program about the 
fact that some kind of positive, perhaps not processes, but 
rough outlines--I am saying this very carefully--regarding the 
economic situation are already taking place. We should begin 
wide-scale, let us say, privatization of small, medium, and 
large enterprises. The reforms that will take place to improve 
banking, credit, and structural reconstruction are all on the 
agenda. They are not only on the agenda, but in practice are 
already under way. 
  [Popovych] Another question on the elections from Yosyp 
Lesiv 
from Belgium. Elections to local bodies of power in Ukraine's 
oblasts and rayons are proposed in conjunction with the new 
presidential elections. According to my understanding of the 
current electoral law, the elections to local bodies of power 
will abolish the institution of presidential missions. As an 
observer of Ukrainian political life, I believe that Ukraine 
needs strong executive power now. This is the stand of our 
listener. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I can only perceive this is as a stance, 
although I have also said this in my domestic usage that the 
president--if he has powers as head of state and as the 
executive power--he should also have corresponding powers in the 
local bodies of power and in the corresponding structures. I am 
convinced that the Soviet representative form and the 
presidential executive form do not relate to each other. This 
is my conviction. 
  There are also other points of view, but I support the one 
that says that if the president should have strong authority, 
then he should have the corresponding strong structures. If the 
president has representative authority, then he is another type 
of president. One should even begin to think about how to elect 
him, when to elect him. Is it necessary for a president with 
only representative functions to be elected by the public? 
These are the main problems. Without resolving them, it is 
difficult to speak of the seriousness of our intentions. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Popovych] I have a question, Mr. President. Returning to 
the Crimea's problems: Yuriy Meshkov himself, the president of 
the autonomy, is stirring up anti-Ukrainian sentiments in 
Crimea. His calls on the eve of elections show this. In 
general, this is some kind of a paradox for the president to 
call on voters not to vote for deputies to Ukraine's Supreme 
Council. So do his current decrees on personnel changes in the 
power department structures--in the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, the security service. Now he has decided to replace 
the justice minister. Will new measures be taken, as his 
decrees have been revoked, as we know. Will new more efficient 
measures be taken with regard to Meshkov's anticonstitutional 
actions? Perhaps in connection with this, here is a question 
from Taras Voytenko from Moscow as to whether there will be 
political autonomization of the regions in order to avoid 
conflicts such as in Moldova and Georgia. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, naturally there is some kind of link here. 
As far as the decrees by Meshkov are concerned, I have already 
been saying that all the decrees issued by Meshkov will be 
rescinded by the president of Ukraine if they violate the 
Constitution and the laws of Ukraine. This will be done without 
fail. I am speaking about the economic decrees only. There may 
be relevant easements in relation to these, because the idea is 
to give more economic freedom, to apply the Ukrainian 
president's decree that grants additional opportunities for the 
economic liberalization of the economy, and so on. 
  Here we will calculate the situation stemming from this 
decree and from our laws. Those laws and decrees that 
contradict our constitutional norms will be rescinded. They 
mean, as far as I understand, that the more political 
independence granted to the regions will lead to easing the 
situation. Well, this is an opinion. I regard Ukraine as a 
unitarian state today, and there may be some prospects for steps 
forward in this direction. However, if political autonomy is 
granted today to all oblasts, if this is what they mean, this 
could lead to the disintegration--I say this sincerely--of our 
statehood. 
  As far as economic autonomies, economic freedoms, as far as 
the broadest possible freedoms are concerned, I support this. 
However, any talk about political autonomy is premature. 
  [Popovych] What do you mean by political autonomy? Do you 
mean free economic zones in certain regions, or do you mean all 
of Ukraine somehow? 
  [Kravchuk] No, this means, for example, oblasts receive 
great 
powers, say, in dealing with property and utilizing budgets. 
More account is taken of their needs and of the sources for 
covering their expenditures, for example, with regard to issues 
connected with quotas or restrictions and the possibilities to 
make use of products to sell in order to replenish hard currency 
funds. That is quite a lot. I have only named a few points. 
These are economic freedoms whereby it is not necessary to go 
to Kiev, to the center, about every little thing. It can be 
decided there, on the spot. 
  As far as economic zones are concerned, however, that is 
another matter. It is envisaged in the law and should be 
examined in every specific case for each territory. What I said 
about economic autonomy applies to all territories. 
  [Popovych] Another listener, Vasyl Semak from Nottingham, 
Great Britain, asks whether the president believes Ukraine will 
survive to the end of your term, because the foreign press 
writes that Ukraine will be divided. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, everyone is making predictions. As one 
says, curse the tongues of those who say this about Ukraine and 
about its possibilities, and praise God that Ukraine has 
survived now for two and a half years since independence was 
declared. It is surviving, working hard, laboriously reaching 
for economic heights, overcoming crisis, and creating its 
political institutions and laws. We do not succeed at 
everything. Not everything is appropriate to our possibilities, 
as one says. This is true. The foreign press writes what it 
wants to see, however. We do not want this. We listen to the 
foreign press and say that you may bark if you really want to 
bark at Ukraine so much, but the show goes on. [passage omitted] 
  [Zadorozhnyy] Petro Dyadyk from Poland points out that the 
anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean Tatars will be 
commemorated and asks why Poland is silent about the Wisla 
operation. Presumably, he would like to know Ukraine's position 
on this. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, we raised this very issue when I met 
President Walesa at the parliament during my visit to Poland. 
We instructed our relevant institutions, the Ministries of 
Foreign Affairs, to study it more and to submit the appropriate 
adjustments and an appropriate stand on this issue. That is, it 
has not been left unconsidered. [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] You know, I would like to say something else. We 
often hear on the surface of our statehood, for example, in 
political circles, at rallies, in squares, and even in the 
Supreme Council, many words that disturb people because the 
words are against Ukraine. When I talk to people, however--for 
example, in collectives, in collectives in the East, in the 
West, in the South, and in the North--I am even more convinced 
that the issue of statehood, the issue of independence, is now 
internally characteristic to our people of all nationalities. 
This is very important. These years did not pass in vain. 
[passage omitted] 
  Goodbye. I wish all of you radio listeners -- Ukrainians and 
non- Ukrainians abroad -- good health, happiness, and all good 
things. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As unofficial sources in Kiev have reported, the 
signing was expected in Crimea of a treaty on dividing the Black 
Sea Fleet personnel in service afloat and a protocol on 
differences in positions of the delegations. According to the 
Kiev version, the defense minister of Russia did not arrive for 
the previously agreed meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart and 
flew to Moscow without explaining the reasons. As one of the 
members of the Ukrainian delegation stated, Ukraine puts the 
entire responsibility for the disruption of the talks on Mr. 
Grachev.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>
  [Text] Lvov 25 April TASS -- President Leonid Kravchuk 
intends to request the new Ukrainian parliament to postpone 
presidential polls scheduled for June 26. 
  He told the "Ukraine" world service radio on Monday that it 
is "inappropriate" to hold the presidential elections as the 
status of the president had not been determined and the 
constitition was not adopted. 
  Kravchuk added that the former parliament adopted the 
decision on holdng the presidential polls "under the pressure of 
opposition." 
  Kravchuk's intention to move up elections is shared by the 
nationalist opposition Rukh movement, the Green Party and the 
Christian Democrats. They decided at their congresses that it 
is dangerous to hold elections in Ukraine at present and did not 
nominate their candidates. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, the major opponent of Kravchuk, also 
refused to run for the president so far. 
  However, the leftist forces became active in this respect. 
The Socialist Party nominated its leader Alexander Moroz, while 
the communists, who ensured a major success at the latest 
parliamentary elections, nominated Petr Simonenko. 
  Other candidates are Speaker Ivan Plushch, former prime 
minister Leonid Kuchma, Vladimir Lanovoi, Vladimir Pilipchuk, 
Yuriy Kostenko, Larisa Skorik.

  [Text] Here is what Russian President Boris Yeltsin said 
about the death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon to 
American television today: 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] The main thing is that I realize 
that he is probably one of the first politicians, one of the 
first major world politicians who understood Russia, who 
understood what it wants, what it is fighting for, who 
understood that Russia wants rebirth, the return of what was 
lost over those seven decades. I am simply grieving over 
Richard Nixon's death. He had my genuine, sincere, heartfelt 
respect, and I regarded him as one of the strongest, one of the 
strongest politicians in the United States of America. I 
sympathize with, and would like to offer my condolences to, the 
family of this very much respected man and great politician.

has expressed his deep grief at the demise of former U.S. 
President Richard Nixon. A notice issued by the Russian 
president's press service indicates that he has conveyed 
profound condolences to the family of the deceased and to the 
American people as a whole. 
  The Russian president stressed that he "sincerely and 
wholeheartedly respected" Nixon -- a major world politician who 
always had a great liking for Russia. Nixon, the Russian leader 
added, was one of the first major political figures to support 
the establishment of the new, democratic Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- The State Duma today requested 
that Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin reconsider the 
expediency of holding joint Russian-American command and staff 
exercises in July 1994 on the Totskoye training ground in 
Orenburg Oblast, "given the social and political situation in 
the country and the crucial stage we are at in the process of 
working out an all-Russian concept of civil accord." This 
address was made in a resolution by the lower house of the 
Federal Assembly. 
  The same document recommends that the foreign and defense 
ministries of the Russian Federation reconsider the expediency 
of having talks on joint maneuvers, with Russia's participation, 
on the territory of one of the NATO countries.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Ulyanov report under the "Problem" rubric: "From </F>
Whom Will Peacekeepers Take Orders? Emergency Situations 
Ministry and Defense Ministry vs State Duma Committee"] 
  [Text] The State Duma is continuing its discussion of a 
draft federal law, approved in the first reading, "On the 
Procedure of Providing Military and Civilian Personnel of the 
Russian Federation for Participation in Operations to Maintain 
or Restore International Peace and Security and in Other Types 
of Peacekeeping Activities," prepared by the State Duma defense 
committee. 
  Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian Federation deputy defense 
minister, who spoke at the hearings, thus outlined the situation 
that had taken shape in the wake of Russia's having carried out 
its peacekeeping obligations to the United Nations and the 
nearest neighbors. Since October 1973, Soviet, and later, 
Russian observers participated in peacekeeping operations under 
UN auspices in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, in the Iran-Iraq 
border area, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Mozambique, ex-Yugoslavia 
and, besides, along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border and in 
Abkhazia. Mr. Kondratyev reminded his audience that had Russia 
not taken in summer 1992 "resolute measures in hot spots of the 
`near abroad,'" without waiting for a legislative base to be 
prepared, the flame of war could have spread to the territory of 
Russia. At that time the Defense Ministry formed, within the 
framework of the Russian Armed Forces, nine battalions of 
Russian military men and sent them to South Ossetia, Georgia, 
and the Dniester Region. A little earlier -- in April 1992 -- a 
Russian battalion, which was later reinforced, was sent to 
Yugoslavia under the UN flag. In Tajikistan there is the 201st 
Motorized Rifle Division with reinforcement assets as part of 
the CIS peacekeeping forces, and more than 16,500 Russian 
servicemen are based on the territories of North Ossetia and 
Ingushetia. Proceeding from the situation that had taken shape, 
two motorized rifle divisions were detached from armed forces 
personnel, whose servicemen are being trained in accordance with 
a particular program specially designed for peacekeeping. 
  After such a thorough instruction of the scenario, the 
Defense Ministry representatives passed over to the main part of 
his address, which is still causing dispute among the deputies. 
Let me set the record straight right away by saying that the 
text of the draft federal law etches in stone the spontaneously 
established norm under which peacekeeping operations are 
conducted by the Defense Ministry. These functions are 
entrusted to Russian Armed Forces line units. A spokesman for 
the Duma Defense Committee spoke in favor of maintaining this 
position, believing that a reassignment of the peacekeeping 
troops and detaching them from armed forces personnel would call 
for the creation of one more Russian army. The state budget has 
no money to support such a decision. 
  Here is what General Kondratyev said in this connection. 
"Among the Defense Ministry leadership there is worry about 
distracting regular troops for the performance of missions 
unrelated to their direct purpose. The personnel are charged 
with police functions untypical for them. One should also take 
account of the fact that the presence of Russian Armed Forces 
units in conflict zones has a negative affect on the growing 
anti-army sentiment among the local population. The use of a 
regular army produces a negative reaction and gives cause for 
systematic accusations of Russia's having an imperial policy." 
Mr. Kondratyev remarked that these sort of functions should not 
be performed by line units but by specially formed, trained, and 
appropriately equipped military contingents, that is, by 
"peacekeeping forces of Russia." The Defense Ministry spokesman 
promised to turn over completely the special training bases set 
up for the already mentioned two separate peacekeeping divisions 
in the charge of the new separate peacekeeping organization. 
  The reason for such a demonstrative debarring of the 
Defense Ministry from peacekeeping functions is simple. There 
is a proposal from the Ministry of Emergency Situations to the 
Defense Ministry on the transfer of the peacemaking functions 
and the peacekeeping subunits to the Ministry of Emergency 
Situations. The Defense Ministry, in the person of Colonel 
General Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, agreed with this 
proposal. 
  Neither did this Emergency Situations Ministry proposal 
raise 
any objections from many deputies. For example, Mr. Popov of 
the Agrarian faction elaborated an entire conception on the need 
to transfer the peacekeeping functions. Its essence is this: 
Under Articles 77 and 78 of the current Constitution, the Armed 
Forces can be put into action only owing to a threat of 
aggression against Russia. But interethnic conflicts, which 
call upon Russia to show firmness and toughness, do not belong 
to such situations. As a rule, the Russian Federation president 
imposed a state of emergency in zones of interethnic feuding, 
and Emergency Situations Ministry representatives were the first 
to start to settle the conflicts -- but after they proved to be 
unmanageable, military subunits were brought in. Thus the State 
Duma Defense Committee members' fears at the Emergency 
Situations Ministry's little specific experience appear 
far-fetched. Mr. Popov believes that the peacekeeping 
contingent ought to be formed on a voluntary basis (this view is 
backed by the "Women of Russia" faction and the majority of 
deputies of the other factions), organized on different 
principles and wear a uniform distinct from that of the Armed 
Forces. Mr. Popov recalled that in the United States this type 
of activity is in the charge of the National Guard, which is not 
part of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the deputy's view, the main 
distinction of the army from a peacekeeping contingent is that 
the latter has no enemy image in carrying out of operations -- 
its functions are distinctly of a humanitarian nature. 
  The Duma's second hearings of the draft law and its approval 
by the Federal Assembly are still ahead. Time will tell if the 
clear contradiction between the main agents covered by the law 
and its drafters will be removed or not. What causes amazement, 
however, is the very fact that whereas the Duma Defense 
Committee has talked about taking into consideration the Defense 
Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry amendments (the latter 
in its turn recommended to the committee to pay attention to 
expert assessments of the Defense Ministry), it has not 
reflected these amendments in any way in the draft law.

  [Text] The Russian State Duma committee responsible for 
relations with political groups and religious organizations 
produced its bill on political parties at a news conference in 
Moscow Friday. 
  Only those political parties would be regarded as national 
whose membership exceeds 5000, which has local organizations 
with memberships of at least 10 in at least one half of the 
regions and republics incorporated into the Russian Federation 
and which have gained at least 5 percent in parliamentary 
elections. 
  Under the bill, parties would own land, buildings and 
installations, houses, equipment and tools, printing houses, TV 
and radio stations, money and other property. 
  The party's funds would be made up of entry and membership 
fees, state subsidies, voluntary donations and proceeds of 
publishing, educational and other activities. At the end of 
every year the party would publish a financial report and a list 
of its property items. 
  The political party would be able to pursue electoral 
campaigns independently or in blocs with other parties. For the 
duration of the campaign the blocs would have the rights and 
duties of a political party. Should a party violate the 
Constitution and legislation, it would be told by the 
prosecutor's office to stop the illegal activities. A party 
failing to comply would be suspended for a maximum of six months 
by a court decision. 
  The parliamentary group in any legislative body made of 
deputies of a political party that has ceased its activities 
would be regarded as dissolved.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "Results of State Duma Hearings on </F>
Foreign Economic Activities. Government Is Recommended to Give 
a Meaning to its Policy"] 
  [Text] As KOMMERSANT-DAILY already wrote on 20 and 22 
April, the parliamentary hearings on foreign economic activities 
organized by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Duma Economic 
Policy Committee, are unlikely to alter appreciably the 
Chernomyrdin cabinet's foreign economic policy. The committee's 
recommendations can still be considered as a rather promising 
option in a bid to improve Russia's foreign economic ties. 
  The Economic Policy Committee proceeds in its 
recommendations 
from the fact that "a sensible state foreign economic policy is 
absent." This finds an expression in that Russian exports are 
increasingly raw-material-oriented which adds no hard currency 
sources for the Russian budget. Besides, Sergey Glazyev 
believes, the existing sources for adding to the budget from 
foreign economic activities are far from being fully used. He 
is confident that a tougher control over customs and hard 
currency, coupled with the abolition of invalid easy terms, can 
alone add to the budget between $8 billion to $12 billion. 
  The committee also asked the Duma to expedite the passing of 
a package of three economic laws that propose to delimit clearly 
the functions of the authorities, to define the rights and 
duties of the participants in foreign economic activities, as 
well as to set the norms on non-tariff regulation and export 
control. 
  As for the government, it was recommended to submit to the 
Duma a program for expanding the export of finished products, to 
coordinate the industrial, foreign economic, scientific and 
technical policy, to make public the procedure for the 
registration of special exporters, as well as to join hands with 
the Central Bank to impede the outflow of capital abroad. 
  Burdened with the current problems (including those created 
by the foreign economic activities lobby), the government is 
hardly enthusiastic about Glazyev's recommendations -- they 
cause irritation because, from the political point of view, they 
detract from the professional prestige of the executive branch. 
  Many others are also unhappy with Sergey Glazyev's 
persistence. For example, as he was preparing the foreign 
economic activities hearings, he applied to the 
"Rosvooruzheniye" state corporation but its chiefs declined to 
provide information about its operations. In response, the 
Committee decided to hold on 24 May hearings on 
military-technical cooperation.

<F P=106> [Olga Gerasimenko and Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin article: "The </F>
Deputies Have Not Gone Round With the Hat, But They Have Done 
Quite a Bit of Traveling -- Such Are the Preliminary Results of 
the State Duma's First 100 Days"] 
  [Text] As one deputy joked rather aptly -- it's funny, but 
the Duma is working. The first 100 days of its work overturned 
the numerous forecasts about an untimely fate for the new 
parliament. To all appearances, nobody (and this particular Mr. 
"Nobody" is very well known) intends to launch another 
antiparliamentary putsch just yet. Indeed, it has to be 
admitted that the Duma members are giving no cause for such 
action. They suffer their everyday hardships stoically (yes, 
they grumble, they appeal for help to our fraternal newspaper, 
PRAVDA, but they are not blackmailing the Kremlin, nor, touch 
wood, are they taking up arms.) And they are legislating with 
tolerable proficiency. The Federation Council, for instance, 
needed 10 days of table thumping to confirm the budget for the 
second quarter, whereas it took the State Duma just one. 
Approximately 100 decrees have been adopted, several dozen laws 
were passed on their first reading, and three, including the 
most important one -- "On the Status of Deputies of the First 
Convocation" -- even went straight through without further 
review. 
  Speaker Ivan Rybkin attributes this work capacity of the 
Duma 
to its well-formulated internal structure. Each Duma committee 
has become a kind of mini-parliament which does not take nine 
months to give birth to laws like the former Supreme Soviet but 
merely brings the presidential and government drafts up to 
standard by means of argument and reconciliation, after which 
thse drafts are discussed in the State Duma Council where the 
faction and committee leaders come to a uniform opinion. Even 
the actual sessional sitting itself serves more as a channel for 
public pronunciation of a decision than for heated debate. 
  Russians are entitled to reproach the Duma for living beyond 
its means -- what with ministerial salaries, cars, dachas, 
foreign trips, and so on and so forth. But each charge acquires 
virtue in comparison. The former parliament, for instance, had 
a fleet of 1,000 cars at its disposal. The Duma is provided 
with just 72, plus 12 buses. But a decision on the allocation 
of a further 300 vehicles has already been prepared. Come 
summer, deputies will be able to take off with their families to 
one of 14 vacation homes, chalets, and dachas. Incidentally, 
the Empress Catherine II also allowed "distinguished citizens" 
to "ride around the city in a coach and two or four, and to own 
suburban courts and gardens." So the roots of deputies' 
privileges (and not only theirs) run deep. 
  Of all the Duma members, just 25 (first come, first served) 
have as yet received apartments following their enforced move 
[za vyseleniyem], and the rest "drift" between the Moskva, Mir, 
and Rossiya Hotels. 
  Unlike the deputies of yesteryear, today's have been 
relieved 
of the need to stand in line for their wages twice a month. 
They line up just once (as in all respectable parliaments 
around the world), which means they receive a lot all at once. 
A deputy's salary fluctuates between 450,000 and 800,000 
[rubles] depending on his post. 
  But let's be honest here: Parliamentarism a priori is an 
expensive luxury. Totalitarianism is cheaper by far, but who 
will be first in line for this option? We are better off 
recalling (and with good cause!) Vasiliy Shulgin, a famous 
deputy from the Fourth State Duma: "...while the deputies 
debate, while they brawl in the parliaments, the machine guns 
lie still. But as soon as these outlets are silenced...the 
malice is directed through other channels." Very well, it is 
better to let deputies get about in a Volvo or a Mercedes, and 
so be it if Zhirinovskiy, like Panikovskiy, feels the blunt end 
of a rubber-soled boot, and all the better if it is painful, for 
through this extravagance and sacrifice they will simultaneously 
save Russian democracy. Is there any more noble lot for the 
people's elected? 
  The Most Diligent, the Most Important [subhead] 
  Do you know, reader, who the most disciplined member of the 
Duma is? It is the Communist Aleksandr Mikhaylov. He has not 
missed a single session, nor skipped a single ballot. Not far 
behind him are L. Gagut, M. Sidorov, and V. Gusev, members of 
the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the Agrarian S.A. 
Ponomarev, and F. Arslanova of "Women of Russia." They have 
missed just half a session in all. And who is the least 
disciplined? The hypnotist Anatoliy Kashpirovskiy and Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev -- neither has once (!) attended the 
Duma assemblies. 
  Government Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha has attended 
just one session, and then only by necessity: He turned up to 
defend agriculturally related budget stances in front of the 
Duma members. Other ministers have only just bettered these 
records -- Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for 
the Management of State Property, has attended one session in 
33; Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin -- one in 14; 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin -- one in 10; Nationalities 
Affairs Minister Sergey Shakhray -- one in nine; and Minister of 
Justice Yuriy Kalmykov -- one in seven. The most diligent of 
all was Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan, who attended one in 
four. It's enough to make anybody want to become a deputy. 
  Among the most disciplined are the following factions (draw 
your own conclusions, voters) -- "Communists of Russia," 
"Agrarian Party," and the LDPR, while the least disciplined are 
Boris Fedorov's "Liberal Democratic Union of 12 December," 
Gaydar's "Russia's Choice," and Shakhray's Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord [PRUA], and Yavlinskiy's "Yabloko." 
  The following table shows attendance at the Duma sessions 
(in

  By far the most influential deputies, according to a poll 
conducted by the Sociological Center for the Study of Political 
Culture, are Speaker Ivan Rybkin, Yegor Gaydar, and Gennadiy 
Zyuganov. The top 50 "most influential" includes 11 
representatives of Russia's Choice, six from "Yabloko," and five 
from the Communist Party of Russia, the LDPR, PRUA, and the 
Agrarian Party. So the level of attendance is not directly 
proportional to degree of importance. Rather, it is the other 
way around. 
<H5>  A Journey May Beckon Tomorrow </H5>
  The deputies have done quite a bit of traveling to various 
parts of the world. In less than four months, 72 members of the 
Duma visited 26 countries. As a Volgograd deputy told us, 
foreign trips are often a matter of chance. A breathless 
colleague races up (or, maybe, bumps into you in the elevator) 
and asks: "Do you have a foreign travel passport?" "Yes." 
"Come on, then, we fly this evening." "Where?" "Give me your 
passport, you will find out soon enough." The stunned colleague 
does not resist, and, indeed, by evening he is walking carefully 
up the gangway and onto an airbus. It's a REEEAL honor to be a 
deputy. 
  Admittedly, the State Duma has not yet ratified a single 
international treaty, although the president and the government 
have sent it around 60. Well, we live in hope. This, after 
all, is the way we are: It takes a while to break this animal. 
  The altogether most heated debates at the sittings center 
on whom to send where. There was an unimaginably desperate 
political-platform duel, for instance, over a problem of great 
moment for Russia -- whom to send as observers for the elections 
in South Africa. It emerged that there were oh so many worthy 
people! Admittedly, we never had the slightest doubt that, in 
our country, every member of the Duma is prepared to assist not 
only de Klerk and Mandela, but also Clinton, and even 'Arafat. 
<H5>  That's the Duma's Lot </H5>
  We do not know how things stand in Rwanda or Burundi, but 
parliamentarians in Russia are under absolutely no threat of 
physical inactivity. We once saw Vladimir Lukin, former Russian 
ambassador to the United States, negotiate 10 stories in 
succession by foot. Then, on the 10th, he suddenly hopped into 
the elevator and, without breathing in (the "Overload" button 
glowed dimly), and pressing himself up against the other 
unbreathing bodies, he went on up to his International Affairs 
Committee on the 24th Floor. Alas, in the former City Hall 
building, the very same trouble is experienced with the 
elevators as with attendance. 
  Just why Duma members are so unenthusiastic about plenary 
sessions is a particular topic of conversation. But an obvious 
guess would be: In running for parliament they were laying 
claim not only, and not necessarily primarily, to the role of 
legislator. For most of them the Duma platform is a useful 
springboard from which to launch themselves into "celebrity 
status" and win popularity. But the Duma denied itself the 
chance of daily televised coverage, which means there is no 
point racing to grab the microphones: Where is the sense in 
pontificating solely for the benefit of fellow deputies and a 
handful of journalists. Surely this explains the fact that even 
some faction leaders -- Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for instance -- 
have never once delivered incendiary speeches actually inside 
the assembly hall in the entire 100 days, while outside such 
speeches are too numerous to count. 
  Building a political image and maintaining a reputation 
earned requires skilled tactics. And rhetorical speechifying at 
the microphones is not always appropriate here. Incidentally, a 
word about reputation. In the opinion of many Duma members from 
the provinces, it is impossible, even in two years, to break 
into the world of the famous through the powerful armor of the 
capital's monster politicians (faction and party leaders, and 
the Mr. Ministers). This is probably why new shining stars in 
the Duma firmament are hardly even glimmering. 
  On the contrary, another trend is emerging: The provincial 
deputies attack their own electoral districts ever more 
resolutely, getting their governorship and mayorality 
campaigning off to an early start. In point of fact, a new 
political local elite is forming in Moscow. And right here 
there is no shortage of such Duma members. 
  We'll place a small wager -- one in three of those who stand 
for the next elections to local administrative bodies will be 
from among today's Children of the Arbat (the Duma is 
still located on the Arbat, No. 36). They will, of course, have 
powerful competition from the "children of Dmitrovka" (the 
Federation Council is installed at No. 46, Dmitrovka). But 
this, to all intents and purposes, is one and the same group. 
<H5>  Our Conclusion </H5>
  The Duma has not justified the worst expectations. But 
nobody got anywhere near the best. Even for this the Duma 
members are worthy of our recognition. Admittedly, the deputies 
of the current convocation, like their Soviet predecessors, feel 
most painfully every shred of criticism directed at them. But, 
in our view, this vice can be forgiven. The Duma members, it 
seems, do not read the foreign press much. Their colleagues 
abroad frankly have to put up with far more from our foreign 
colleagues. So this infantile disorder of parliamentarism is 
just something you have to go through. 
  That there are very few places where the president and the 
government would place the supreme representative authority in 
the humiliating conditions experienced in Russia is another 
matter. But this is a topic for another article.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Ivanov report: "The Bottom Line of a Political </F>
Scandal. An Ordinary Russian Speaker Who Has Led Everyone Down 
the Garden Path"] 
  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, who became a State Duma deputy on the 
ticket of the Agrarian Party and was elected speaker at the 
initiative of the communists, has definitely broken with the 
opposition. This week he announced that he would step down as 
deputy chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF]. Yesterday, 
the plenary meeting of the CPRF Central Executive Committee 
plenary meeting readily met his request. 
  There are various opinions regarding Ivan Rybkin, current 
State Duma chairman and former second secretary of the Volgograd 
Oblast Communist Party committee. Some see him as a man coming 
from the people who has been elevated to the high post by sheer 
happenstance. "The milestones of my working biography are pretty 
simple," Rybkin said, justifiably so, in a recent interview. 
Indeed, the speaker has a typical agrarian-staff background: 
quiet work at the organization departments of first district, 
then oblast, party committees; and finally the Central Committee 
of the RSFSR Communist Party. It should be added that Rybkin's 
appearance is fully in line with his biography: a short 
stature, a quiet voice, pleasant manners in conversation, and a 
complete absence even of outward signs of willfulness, let alone 
charisma. Nonetheless, unlike most of his colleagues who have 
quietly settled down in all kinds of businesses, not only has 
Rybkin made a brilliant career by assuming one of the highest 
state posts, but he is by right considered one of the ten most 
influential Russian politicians. 
  What appears to be more pertinent is another view whereby 
the 
role of a "gray politician," a "mediocrity," is just a role the 
State Duma chairman sometimes thinks necessary to play. 
Meanwhile, Rybkin did not seem a mediocrity at all at the 
Supreme Soviet, where he carefully but uncompromisingly 
criticized the "Yeltsin regime." Yet more proof of his firm 
political convictions is the fact that in October he was one of 
the last to have been escorted out of the burning White House at 
gunpoint. 
  When Rybkin started talking about loyalty to the president 
and commitment to the course of reform upon having been "pushed 
through" by the communists and agrarians as State Duma chairman, 
the speaker's former supporters accused him of opportunism and 
"working for the democrats." However, those who are closely 
familiar with Rybkin are certain that no metamorphoses have 
occurred in him: "It is not he who is changing, but 
circumstances, and Rybkin is just adapting to the circumstances 
so as to work effectively." In fact, Rybkin can well go to the 
president (for whose impeachment he voted in September) with a 
bunch of flowers on his birthday, or to appoint Andrey Voykov, a 
democrat, who formerly was deputy chief of the presidential 
administration, as chief of the State Duma's staff. All this is 
essentially trifles, but Ruslan Khasbulatov's recent experience 
has shown fairly convincingly that it is trifles (inappropriate 
words or gestures) that can help one fall out with the president 
for good. As regards matters of principle, however, the speaker 
acts decisively and quite independently. After all, it is 
precisely Rybkin's staffers who quickly and promptly formalized 
the release of the "Lefortovo inmates," thus making it 
impossible for the president "to reverse" the amnesty decree. 
  Clearly, Rybkin's apparently scandalous departure from the 
Communist Party leadership should not be overestimated. While 
heading the lower chamber, Rybkin has not become a pawn in the 
hands of the opposition. But seeing him as the president's man 
would also be ill-advised. He is playing his own game. His 
short-term program is quite clear: not to repeat the sad 
experience of Anatoliy Lukyanov and Ruslan Khasbulatov. As for 
his long-term program, many deputies believe that the wise and 
careful Rybkin with an image of "a mediocrity" may turn out to 
be a compromise figure suiting political forces as a 
presidential candidate who will be easy to manipulate in case of 
his victory. But what Rybkin himself thinks on the subject is 
still anyone's guess.

  [Text] London April 26 TASS -- Representatives of the 
United Kingdom, Russia, the United States and France held 
consultations on finding a solution to the Bosnian conflict in 
the British capital on Monday. British Prime Minister John 
Major, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and 
Russian representative, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, 
who arrived here, took part in the meeting. 
  British foreign department told ITAR-TASS that during the 
consultations discussions were held on comprehensive measures to 
normalise the situation in the former Yugoslavia on the basis of 
a universal ceasefire and settlement of territorial disputes. 
In particular, the idea of creating a special contact group, 
comprising high-ranking representatives of all sides interested 
in the speedy implementation of ceasefire in Bosnia, was put 
forward. According to preliminary reports, its first session 
will be held on Tuesday. That is why there is no cause to hurry 
the events, the British Foreign Office told ITAR-TASS. 
  Addressing journalists after his meeting with the prime 
minister, Vitaliy Churkin, who is putting stress on diplomatic, 
and not military means to overcome the critical situation in 
Bosnia, called on the warring sides of the commiunity to display 
goodwill in the interests of signing a peace agreement.

  [Text] The Hague, 25 Apr -- Russia is proposing to hold a 
third international peace conference in 1999. This is stated in 
a note by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The document 
was read out today in the Palace of Peace at a session of the 
Administrative Council of the permanent chamber of the 
International Court of Arbitration by Leonid Skotnikov, the 
Russian ambassador to the Netherlands. 
  On the instructions of President Boris Yeltsin and on behalf 
of Russia as chairman of the two peace conferences at The Hague 
in 1899 and 1907, which adopted the international convention on 
the laws and customs of war, the Russian foreign minister 
appeals to all states with a proposal to discuss the idea of 
convening a third international peace conference, the note says. 
  The agenda of the proposed conference, the document says, 
could include questions of improving the system of the peaceful 
settlement of disputes, filling the gaps in international 
humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts, and also 
creating a system of international criminal justice in relation 
to crimes against peace and mankind and other international law 
violations.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 
Chernobyl disaster anniversary. 
  The newspaper carries a map of the European part of the 
former Soviet Union showing areas of radiological contamination 
after the breakdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. 
  "Radiation affected 70 percent of Belarusian territory. Two 
million and three hundred thousand Belarusians, among them half 
a million children, are the direct victims of the Chernobyl 
disaster. These figure are comparable only with the number of 
victims of Nazi genocide: every fourth out of ten million 
Belarusians was killed." 
  The newspaper also reports the lack of funds for the 
elimination of the aftermath of the disaster, a shortage of 
hospital accommodation, and scarcity of medicines in clinics. 
  PRAVDA on the same subject: 
  "In 1986 the misfortune united people, nations and 
countries. 
Now we live wide apart. Chernobyl-affected people regret the 
break-up of the Soviet Union. They see how the programme for 
the elimination of the aftermath of the disaster has virtually 
disintegrated. Meanwhile, the Chernobyl disaster aftermath 
continues to impair people's health and claim their lives. In 
1993 alone, 7,000 more Chernobyl troubleshooters became 
incapacitated." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Cherbobyl disaster aftermath: 
  "Out of 300,000 people in Russia who were affected by the 
Chernobyl disaster, 30,000 became invalids, more than 5,000 
died, and death rate among them grows with every passing year. 
More than 30,000 of them have no housing accomodation or are in 
need of improved housing". 
  The newspaper gives opinions of experts who believe that 
there are no guarantees against other nuclear breakdowns so far. 
  "One may ask how many people would be ready to display 
heroism and self-sacrifice shown by the Chernobyl 
troubleshooters, if the country, in the name of which they 
sacrificed themselves, has sought to forget about them and their 
needs?" 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes Professor Viktor Mikhailov, Russian 
Federation minister for nuclear power, as saying that 
"technically, a breakdonw similar to the Chernobyl one is ruled 
out. However, this does not mean that no incidents could happen 
again". 
  TRUD carries an article dedicated to the memory of 
academician Valeriy Legasov. In 1986, he was a member of the 
governmental commission for inquiry into the Chernobyl disaster 
and directly participated in putting out the fire there. In 
1988 he committed suicide. The writer of the article makes an 
attempt to unravel the mystery why Legasov took his own life. 
  TRUD interviewed federation council speaker Vladimir 
Shumeyko 
who made an evaluation of a draft treaty on civic accord in 
Russia. He agreed with the document in principle. 
  "I have some observations to make on individual clauses of 
the document. But I believe that if we set about refining it, 
it will never be adopted. Therefore I regard as extremely 
important and correct the proposal to set up a standing 
constitutional commission. Such a commission is essential for 
the entire duration of the treaty and moratorium on political 
wars", Shumeyko said. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an inteview with constitutional court 
member Valeriy Zorkin. Asked about his attitude to the draft 
treaty on civic accord, Zorkin said that "while sharing on the 
whole the idea of the treaty and supporting it, I think its 
initiators has seriously miscalculated, failing to arrange for a 
countrywide discussion of the draft treaty, as is provided for 
in an appropriate presidential instruction. 
  "The treaty will be really effective when it becomes 
agreement of the people, not just of elites or individual 
citizens even if they are worthy of respect". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reprints Boris Yeltsin's interview with 
DER SPIEGEL magazine. Touching upon the question of Russia's 
involvement in NATO's Partnership-for-Peace programme, the 
Russian president said: "We are prepared to sign the partnership 
agrement but at the same time we would like to sign with NATO an 
additional protocol to settle a number of principled matters". 
  NEZAVISIAMAYA GAZETA runs a list of 50 most powerful and 
influential figures of Russian business. The list includes the 
names of the chiefs of major commercial organisations -- banks. 
Exchanges, foundations, joint-stock companies, trading houses, 
insurance companies, joint ventures, etc. 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs a report delivered by Gennadiy 
Zyuganov, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the 
Russian Communist Party, at an all-Russia party conference in 
April.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "NATO Initiative May Be Upheld" -- </F>
first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] At a meeting of the Belarusian Security Council, 
the Foreign and Defense Ministries have been asked to examine in 
detail the issue of possible Belarusian membership in NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative. 
  Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb noted that, to 
fulfill 
the request, Belarusian specialists may even have to go abroad. 
They will have to examine issues concerning the training of 
personnel and holding consultations on possible financial and 
technical assistance. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" initiative, the state leader 
believes, includes aspects that are both admissible and not 
entirely admissible to the Republic. The participation of 
Belarusian servicemen in peacekeeping missions aimed at 
preventing conflicts on territories of other states was 
described by Mechyslaw Ivanavich as one of the inadmissible 
aspects. 
  If a decision is made to join the initiative, the document 
may be signed as early as this year, Mechyslaw Hryb stated.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 79 (569): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin; quotation marks as received] 
  [Text] Below are the excerpts from Parliamentary Chairman 
Mechyslaw Hryb's speech at last week's international forum of 
newly-independent states in Bucharest. 
  "The Supreme Soviet and Belarusian government embraced a 
guarded policy of economic reforms with the main focus on 
treatment rather than shock to be able to ward off a sharp fall 
in living standards. That is why we have used fixed prices on 
some foodstuffs and housing rent and services rather than price 
liberalization over the interim period. We have kept intact 
subsidies on a range of essentials. 
  At the same time, our economy is undergoing hard times in a 
period of transition to market relations. Economic reform is 
hampered because of the huge spending involved for the purpose 
of disarmament and elimination of the after-effects of the 
Chernobyl nuclear accident. 
  It must be said that Belarus was badly hit by the severance 
of economic ties, emergence of new borders and trade barriers 
between the republics of the former Soviet Union. Having no 
mineral resources of our own and being a virtual assembly plant 
of the former Soviet Union, we have found ourselves at an 
extreme disadvantage. Our producers are having to buy raw 
materials and fuel at prices much higher than Russia's internal 
prices. Nonetheless, we find it increasingly hard to compete 
even in the Russian market at which the country's exports are 
oriented. 
  In these conditions, we have embarked on forming an economic 
and monetary union with Russia in an effort to remove hurdles to 
the flow of goods and services, realign prices for mining 
products and set better conditions for the country's economic 
performance. In the meantime, it must be said that this will 
have no serious impact on our sovereignty. 
  Of course, we are well aware of being just at the onset of 
reforms and of the daunting job to be done. However, the legal 
groundwork for reform is already there and the pace of economic 
reforms is accelerating." 
  Hryb next pointed to a number of conclusions made following 
three years of the country's economic reform. 
  To begin with, he said, the pace of overhauling the old 
administrative system of economic management was lower than that 
of forming market infrastructures leading to lower efficiency in 
economic management. 
  Secondly, apart from internal factors, the strategy of 
market 
reforms was largely dependent on external ones which for a 
variety of reasons proved difficult for readjustment to the pace 
of domestic reforms. 
  Thirdly, the mentality of the public used to accept high 
social security guarantees as something granted appeared to be 
one of the stumbling blocks to the acceleration of market 
reforms. 
  Next, the widespread support for radical political and 
economic reforms of the late 1980's and early 1990's was 
followed by a sense of profound anxiety for the future. The 
cost of perestroyka turned out too high. Efforts aimed at an 
artificial acceleration of reforms have failed to bring any 
tangible results causing general disenchantment which has 
largely dented the idea of shifting to market economy. 
  Next, we have underestimated the factor of public unity with 
an aim of building a democratic society and embracing market 
reforms. 
  And finally, the emergence of an attractive legal groundwork 
has failed to bring the much wanted foreign investment in areas 
such as joint projects in engineering and power generation 
industries, transport and communications, chemicals and 
petrochemical industries and the farming sector.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Amageldy Akhmetalimov </F>
and Gennadiy Kulagin] 
  [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 24 April TASS -- Li Peng, premier 
of China's Council of State, begins a four-day visit to 
Kazakhstan on Monday, 25 April, on the final leg of his tour of 
Central Asia republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  This will be the first visit to sovereign Kazakhstan by one 
of top Chinese leaders. Judging by information coming in from 
official circles, the visit is associated with hopes for the 
revitalisation and development of bilateral relations. 
  Goods turnover between Kazakhstan and China decreased to 
$205 
million U.S. dollars last year as against $433 million in 1992. 
Only a few out of 150 registered joint ventures are engaged in 
production activities while the bulk of them practice trade and 
purchasing operations. 
  A number of direct agreements were concluded recently 
between 
Kazakhstan and China enterprises on establishing the 
co-manufacture of various types of industrial products and 
consumer goods. This is a good sign which shows that the basic 
document which determines long-term cooperation between the two 
neighbouring countries -- the joint declaration on the 
principles of friendly relations, which was signed during 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to China in October last 
year -- begins to work in earnest at last. 
  In all, 15 bilateral agreements have already been concluded. 
They concern political, trade, economic, scientific, technical 
and cultural contacts between Kazakhstan and China. 
  Li Peng is to hold talks with Nazarbayev here in a narrow 
format and meet with members of the Republic's business 
community. There will be also talks between official 
delegations. 
  As a result of the visit, the two sides are to sign an 
agreement on the Sino-Kazakhstan state border, which is 1,700 km 
long, and agreements on a Chinese commodity credit, which is 
expected to amount to about 50 million U.S. dollars, to 
Kazakhstan, and on Chinese humanitarian aid to the Republic to 
the tune of 1.5 million yuan.

  [Excerpts] An official Chinese delegation led by Prime 
Minister Li Peng arrived in Almaty this afternoon for a four-day 
visit. At the airport of our capital, which was decorated by 
the state flags of the two countries and welcoming slogans, the 
delegation was met by President Nazarbayev and other officials. 
Kazakhstan Ambassador to China Murat Auezov and Chinese 
Ambassador to Kazakhstan Chen Di were also present. [passage 
omitted] 
  The program for the visit envisages talks between Nazarbayev 
and Li Peng in a narrow circle as well as talks between the 
delegations. The prime minister will hold a meeting at the 
business center with representatives of the business circles of 
Kazakhstan and a large group of their Chinese counterparts who 
have arrived in Almaty. Li Peng will visit the Merey furniture 
production joint stock amalgamation, hold a news conference, and 
familiarize himself with places of interest in our capital. 
  An agreement on the Kazakh-Chinese state border is expected 
to be signed as result of the talks, as well as agreements 
related to a commodity loan and humanitarian aid given by China 
to our Republic. These documents will be added to the range of 
joint agreements which have been signed concerning bilateral 
political, trade and economic, scientific and technical, and 
cultural relations. These include the joint declaration on the 
foundations of friendly relations, which is the main document 
determining future cooperation between the two neighboring 
states. This was signed last October, when Nazarbayev visited 
China.

  [Text] At their Saturday, 23 April, session, the 
parliamentarians examined a draft of the temporary regulations 
of the Supreme Council presented by Nikolay Akuyev. From the 
outset of the discussion of the document, it became clear that 
the deputies are very strict and particular about its 
endorsement. Serious debates were held with regard to 
nominations of candidatures for the posts of chairpersons of the 
parliamentary committees. A provision was adopted that these 
candidates would be nominated not only by the speaker, but also 
by the deputies. 
  A statement on behalf of a group of the members of the 
Supreme Council representing Karaganda and Kostanay Oblasts was 
made by Boris Marinushkin. The serious economic situation of 
the Republic is at issue in this statement. The deputies 
believe that the government and the leadership of the National 
Bank are to blame for this situation. The deputies put forward 
a proposal to the Constitutional Court of the Republic to 
examine the competence and legality of measures taken by the 
Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank. 
  At today's morning session examination of the draft of the 
temporary regulation was resumed. Provisions for setting up 
deputies' factions and groups and organizing hearings in the 
Council were discussed in full detail. The deputies disputed 
those articles of the temporary regulations that envisage the 
setting up and functioning of the coordination council of the 
Supreme Council. The Supreme Council should have a special 
collegiate organ that will resolve unresolvable problems. The 
position of those who put the proposal forward got the upper 
hand as result of the vote. At last, the temporary regulation 
was endorsed; it has been suggested to produce by 1 July the 
standing regulation of the Supreme Council for examination by 
the deputies. The session then began to examine behind closed 
doors the issue concerning the maintenance and provision of work 
of the Supreme Council deputies.

  [Text] After returning from a visit to the U.S., Estonian 
Prime Minister Mart Laar, on Monday [25 April], pointed to his 
meetings with U.S. Defence Minister William Perry and UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali as the most influential 
during his visit. 
  Laar told a press conference, on Monday, that his meeting 
with Perry was extremely efficient in discussion of situation of 
Estonian defence forces, borderguard and the Baltic peacekeeping 
battalion to be formed. He pointed to Perry's statement that 
the U.S. will not let anyone "dictate in what amount and with 
whom it will develop security policy cooperation". He added 
that U.S. concern about Estonian-Russian interstate negotiations 
was illustrated by the fact that Perry expressed clear support 
to unconditional Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by August 
31, 1994. 
  Laar said that during his meetings in the U.S., he discussed 
possible arms deals but no concrete plans to buy arms have been 
made yet. He said that we had to better define our defence 
forces conception to decide what kind of arms Estonia needed. 
He added that arms aid programmes will be discussed more 
closely at the forthcoming visit of a NATO delegation. 
  As to his meeting with UN Secretary General, Laar said that 
Butrus Butrus- Ghali adopted a very strong position as to 
Russian troop withdrawal. "If it is clear in May that Russian 
troops do not move and no preparations to troop withdrawal take 
place, Ghali asked to turn to UN to apply mechanisms that are in 
UN disposal," Laar said.

informs that the Estonian consumer price index rose by 16.9 
percent in the first three months of this year against the 
fourth quarter of 1993.

and 5.5 percent in January. 
  In the first quarter, services went up by an average of 24.7

manufactured goods, by 6.7 percent. 
  Under services, housing expenditures grew the most, by 25.3 
percent, followed by transport and communications with a 21.7- 
percent increase, and outlays on leisure with 11.2 percent. 
  Of foods, fruit and vegetables showed a 33.6-percent 
increase 
for seasonal reasons; milk, dairy products and eggs went up by 
30.3 percent, fats by 20.7 percent, meat and fish by 17.4 
percent, and non-alcoholic beverages by 16.3 percent.

  [Text] The Foreign Affairs and Security Committee of the 
Cabinet of Ministers today approved the concept of the defense 
system of the Republic of Latvia. According to this concept, 
the state defense system comprises the national armed forces, 
the joint systems of personnel and supplies, and non-military 
institutions of the state defense system. 
  The concept of the defense system provides for Latvian 
involvement in general and regional processes of the European 
economic and political development and the unified European 
security system, coordinated exercises of the Baltic states, 
setting up weaponry and information exchange systems and joint 
military units with them, and cooperation with them in the 
spheres of control of the state border, territory, territorial 
waters, the economic zone of the Baltic Sea, and airspace. The 
concept lays down tasks for each constituent part of the 
national armed forces in implementing the state's defense.

  [Text] The Russian delegation which is to take part in the 
final stage of the interstate talks, before the two countries' 
presidents sign a treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Latvia, this afternoon arrived in Riga from Moscow. 
  Russian delegation head Sergey Zotov told journalists that 
the talks about the last adjustments to the treaty will be 
taking place in Riga for no longer than two days. 
  [Begin Zotov recording in Russian with superimposed Latvian 
translation] First I want to say that the agreements initialled 
by us have been misunderstood in Latvia. I repeat, Russia 
itself will take care of the social guarantees for the military 
personnel discharged from its Army, and the payment of pensions 
will also be our responsibility. We do not ask that the Russian 
military be given special privileges. However, I will add that 
the international obligations which your country has undertaken 
to guarantee at the United Nations for the citizens of another 
country must be observed. 
  Reports by the mass media on the interstate agreements 
initialled between Latvia and Russia, as well as their 
discussion by the Saeima, have been distorted. Russia will 
withdraw the Army by 31 August. We are ready for the meeting of 
the two countries' presidents and the signing of the treaty. 
Russia is not interested in changing its stance, which has 
already been in force for two years. [end recording]

  [Text] Vilnius, April 25, ELTA -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas told the radio that he "would try to 
evaluate the historical stage of the Lithuanian-Polish relations 
at the Seimas plenary meeting on Tuesday" [26 April]. 
  Speeches by Lithuanian and Polish presidents will be 
delivered soon after the treaty is signed. The ceremony should 
take place around the noon on Tuesday. 
  Brazauskas said that the treaty included problems of the 
national minorities and expressed hope that the articles of the 
treaty would make a solid background to solve the problems of 
Lithuanians in Poland and Poles in Lithuania on a parity basis". 
  Brazauskas put accents on educational problems. He said that 
meanwhile 127 Polish schools worked in Lithuania while at the 
beginnning of the national revival there were only 92. Last 
year there were 148 groups for Polish children in the pre-school 
institutions. 
  1200 young people of Polish nationality study at the 
institutions of higher education, 400 every year leave for 
Poland to study. Brazauskas reminded that last year the Polish 
language and literature department had been established at 
Vilnius University. 40 students study at the department. 
  Six specialities can be studied in Polish language at 
Vilnius 
Pedagogical University. Polish is also studied at Kaunas and 
Vilnius Seminaries. 
  Four Polish periodicals out of eight which circulate in 
Lithuania receive the support from the state. Polish radio and 
television are broadcasted in Lithuania. 
  At the beginning of the year 261.5 thousand people of Polish 
nationality lived in Lithuania, which made seven percent of the 
total population. 
  There are 35 thousand of Lithuanians in Poland. They have 
several schools, a magazine and broadcast radio features from 
Bialystok. 
  Brazauskas said he did not want to set one nation against 
the 
other, however, Lithuanians in Poland had more cultural 
problems. Brazauskas hoped to discuss many of them during the 
meeting with Walesa.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 25, ELTA -- Polish social democratic 
newspaper the TRYBUNA published an interview with Stanislav 
Meler, deputy director of the European Department at the Polish 
Foreign Ministry who had participated in drafting the bilateral 
treaty. 
  Meler said: "During the conversations with Lithuanians I 
have 
noticed well-grounded doubts about whether the treaty really 
will change relations between our countries or whether it will 
merely be a paper. Everything will depend on the "political 
will". 
  "All the articles of the treaty on the national minorities 
make a solid background for the normalization of our relations, 
in the psychological aspect in particular. We managed to avoid 
formulations in the treaty which could stipulate irritation or 
show the superiority of one country over the other", Meler said. 
  "The realization of the treaty which will be signed for 15 
years and then automaticaly expanded, will depend on the 
political benevolence of the both states", Meler noted. 
  It is admitted in the article that the preparation of the 
treaty with Lithuania, the last neighbour with which Poland did 
not have any document, was long and complicated. It was 
protracted because Lithuanians demanded that the so-called 
occupation of Vilnius region in the inter-war period by Poland 
should be condemned in the treaty.

  [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas believes that the 
process of delimitation and demarkation of the border between 
Lithuania and Belarus "is unjustifiably dragged out" after the 
change in the Belarussian government. 
  In an interview with Interfax in Bucharest where Brazauskas 
arrived for taking part in the international forum on the 
burning economic and political problems, the Lithuanian leader 
noted that after the resignation of the chairman of the 
Belarussian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich "meetings 
suspended" between corresponding intergovernmental delegations 
and experts of Foreign Ministries. The Lithuanian president 
intends to discuss this subject with the head of the Belarussian 
parliament Mechyslaw Hyrb now visiting Bucharest and hopes that 
corresponding talks will resume in the near future. 
  Brazauskas made it clear that he intends to insist on the 
division of the border railway station Adutiskes claimed by both 
states and on its joint use. 
  Interfax has information that the dispute over this station 
occurred during the delimitation of the Belarussian-Lithuanian 
border at the level of experts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Adolfas Slezevicius, Lithuanian prime </F>
minister and LDDP chairman, by LDDP Deputy Chairman Gediminas 
Kirkilas; place and date not given: "We Will Continue To Seek 
Stability"] 
  [Text] [Kirkilas] Mr. Chairman, tomorrow marks the first 
anniversary of your election as the new leader of the Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] at its third congress. 
  Assuming this double responsibility, you, as well as the 
LDDP, legalized a norm which is new to Lithuania's political 
life, but which is traditional in Western democratic systems, 
when leaders of a party that has the majority in the legislature 
also become heads of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  [Slezevicius] If this tradition takes root in our country, 
the voters will know in the next elections who will be prime 
minister if one party or another wins the ballot. 
  [Kirkilas] Currently, the Social Democrats are trying to 
collect signatures from Seimas [parliament] deputies so as to 
announce an interpellation to your government. According to 
Western standards, this would mean that A. Sakalas, leader of 
the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, claims... the office of 
prime minister. However, I would like to ask you about something 
else. In your opinion, why is a no-confidence vote, which -- 
this is clear -- has no perspective, initiated now when the 
first shoots of stability are emerging in the country, albeit 
with difficulty? 
  [Slezevicius] Maybe, because of this particular fact. I 
would not like to believe, however, that Lithuania's Social 
Democrats could be for destabilization. They may be trying to 
correct in a peculiar way the mistake they made after the 
elections -- their refusal to form a governing coalition with 
the LDDP. 
  [Kirkilas] Why did that happen? Did they want to attract 
attention to themselves or prevent the LDDP from joining the 
Socialist International? 
  [Slezevicius] Both the Social Democrats and other parties 
are 
misled by the thought that the LDDP will fail to form a cabinet 
by itself, and that it will collapse shortly in this difficult 
and critical situation when hyperinflation is flourishing, 
prices are rising, and living standards are declining, to say 
nothing of the crime rate. Why should they go with those who 
will fall soon? Therefore, they have chosen the position of 
hesitation, observation, and criticism. 
  [Kirkilas] After it became clear that these tactics are 
fruitless, they have undertaken more radical moves -- to declare 
an interpellation to the government, that is, to enhance the 
post- election mistake. Might the Social Democrats' criticism 
be partially correct? 
  [Slezevicius] Of course. We ourselves see certain faults. 
  The government is open to all political forces. As the 
government and party leader, I am ready to consult with other 
parties and adopt their proposals. This does not require the 
moves that discredit Lithuania's stability. 
  The Social Democrats' actions are quite controversial: They 
are proposing a coalition alongside a no-confidence motion in 
the government. They immediately put forward additional 
conditions -- other parties must also participate in this 
coalition.... 
  [Kirkilas] A broader coalition is hardly possible in 
Lithuania today. Moreover, the right-wing parties do not voice 
such a desire. However, I believe that it is necessary to 
discuss and consult on these issues. 
  Let us go back to the LDDP. You have toured more than 30 
Lithuanian regions and towns over the year. What are your 
impressions? 
  [Slezevicius] There have really been quite a few meetings. 
They were extremely useful: I saw how people react to and 
assess government actions. I understood better which governing 
methods are more effective and what problems are the most 
pressing. 
  I see that society is changing: Aggressiveness and anger are 
fading. There is a more constructive and businesslike approach. 
Most of the questions (about 60-70 percent) concerned the return 
of property and loans. Particularly many mistakes were made in 
agriculture. They are also the most difficult to correct. 
  LDDP members are very active everywhere. They are often more 
critical than their political opponents. However, they are 
benevolent. 
  [Kirkilas] Could you now say that both positions -- the 
leader of the government and the party -- compliment or impede 
each other? 
  [Slezevicius] I can say with confidence that this not easy. 
One thing is obvious that the government leader, who is 
constantly accountable to the party and the political force that 
has nominated him, will always be more determined in making his 
decisions and will understand problems much better. All of 
Lithuania's former prime ministers were not delegated to the 
government by definite parties. This may have partially 
determined their failures. 
  A party represents support not only during elections, but 
particularly after them, when one must implement the promised 
program. 
  [Kirkilas] What are your immediate plans as party leader? 
  [Slezevicius] We will continue to seek stability -- in the 
economy, politics, social life, and relations with our neighbors. 
  Although our opponents do not notice any positive changes, 
the latter do exist nonetheless. Not only we ourselves, but 
also independent experts and specialists from the World Bank and 
the IMF speak about them. One has the impression that it is 
this fact that causes our political opponents' greatest concern. 
Therefore, their criticism resembles more an election campaign 
than a constructive opposition. 
  Our party has begun to prepare for the self-government 
elections. It is very important that Lithuanian people choose 
those who will be capable of dealing with the problems in their 
region, town, or village, and of resolving them in a competent 
manner rather than engaging in politics. 
  The LDDP leadership, Presidium, and Seimas faction have 
recently discussed and projected decision lines in social, 
health, cultural, educational, and other spheres. We will 
return to legal, national security, and other problems in the 
immediate future. 
  [Kirkilas] I wish the following year was successful for you 
as LDDP leader.

<F P=106> [Speech by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas before </F>
the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in 
Strasbourg on 14 April] 
  [Text] Mr. President, 
  Madame Secretary General, 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, 
  I am exited to be able to speak to you today. I represent 
Lithuania -- one of the three Baltic states which base their 
development on universal and acknowledged values: Democracy, 
freedom, human rights, the supremacy of law, and social justice. 
  I believe that one of the most important things that we have 
gained in Lithuania after the restoration of independence on 11 
March 1990 is the feeling of, and the aspiration for, unity with 
Europe. This is a clear understanding in the people that 
Lithuania is a European state. Lithuanian people are 
consistently implementing and testifying to this inner principle 
in practice. Apart from all this, we do not mean that Lithuania 
expects benefits from Europe, but we mean that it is actively 
looking for ways of becoming useful and interesting to Europe. 
We pursue neither a policy of nationalistic egoism nor state 
isolation. On the contrary, our openness and readiness to 
reconciliate different interests meeting in Lithuania and the 
desire for wise compromises push us ahead. We cannot allow 
Lithuania, which, incidentally, is in the geographic center of 
Europe, to become its province. 
  There are people in this assembly who are familiar with my 
background and who have heard that I headed the secession of the 
Lithuanian Communist Party from Moscow. Back in 1989, we 
clearly spoke out for a democratic and independent Lithuanian 
state. That was the first move of its sort in the former Soviet 
Union, which was transferred to the CPSU monolith in 1989. I do 
not want to overestimate any party or movement, the role of one 
politician or another in restoring the independent Lithuania. 
The will of the Lithuanian people themselves to manage their 
affairs and create a citizens' community and a democratic state 
was and remains the decisive basis for change. History itself, 
the beginning of reform in the former Soviet Union, and support 
of the free world community for our aspirations, which pursued 
the policy of nonrecognition of occupation and annexation, 
create conditions for this state to become a reality. 
  In the first direct presidential elections in the history of 
Lithuania, people voted for me as I am, knowing my background. 
I am convinced that history has granted a chance for all 
Lithuanian people, including myself, to create a democratic 
state and a new community, where people should not be divided 
into winners and losers. 
  The collapse of the communist system in Eastern and Central 
Europe, and the deepening processes of integration in the West, 
simply do not leave any other alternative than participation in 
building the new Europe. Following the "Cold War" and 
ideological confrontation, I think that we would not be 
satisfied with a Europe of "cold peace" and local conflicts. 
Lithuania, as well as other Eastern and Central European 
states, would like to see the West expand its attention and 
assistance to the countries east of the fallen Berlin Wall, 
treating this region as an integral part of the new Europe. The 
West should have a better understanding of the complicated and 
real problems, and even dangers that could ensue from the 
increasing instability in some Eastern states. 
  In terms of European security and stability, and within the 
context of the predicted expansion of the European Union to the 
East, the importance of the Stability Pact becomes obvious. 
Lithuania understands this initiative not only as a forum for 
discussions on regional security and stability problems, but 
also as an effective measure for regulating interstate political 
conflicts and a means of preventive diplomacy. Exerting our 
efforts to prevent the problems of ethnic minorities and borders 
from posing additional threats to the security of regions or 
even of all Europe, we should not forget the influence of 
economic and social factors and their link with these problems. 
It seems that the latter could be resolved through the 
so-called "additional agreements" which are envisioned in 
executing the pact. 
  Last spring, during my meeting with members of the Vilnius 
University Senate and ambassadors accredited in Vilnius on the 
occasion of Lithuania's admission to the European Council, as 
well as during the summit meeting in Vienna, I proposed to hold 
a conference of the heads of new democratic states. 
  This conference could be held under the auspices of the 
European Council. This would not be an attempt to form another 
bloc or a place to complain of economic difficulties. The most 
important thing is that we could have businesslike consultations 
on how to strengthen the democratic system, conduct reforms 
related to it, and overcome difficulties that are common to most 
countries. West European states have learned the art of 
democratic and equal cooperation for decades. We do not have so 
much time. It would be very important if we could shorten this 
time by joint effort and with the assistance of the European 
Council. I believe that the participation in this conference of 
Western States, which have the experience of the successful 
transition from autocracy to democracy, would be extremely 
significant. 
  I see the exceptional role of the European Council in 
ensuring progress in the creation of a new and democratic 
Europe. The activities of the Parliamentary Assembly are 
important both in implementing pan-European political 
cooperation, and in specifying, defining, and defending human 
rights and freedoms considering the world changes under way. It 
is very important that all European institutions, which are 
already operating or which are being created, function in 
agreement, without mutual duplications and contradictions. 
  Our country has achieved a sufficient level of political, 
economic, and social stability. Since the 1992 democratic 
elections, all government institutions projected in the new 
Constitution, that was adopted in a referendum, have functioned 
in Lithuania. Nine political parties are represented in the 
Seimas [parliament]. The current majority in the Seimas is held 
by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, which has formed a 
stable government. Several opposition factions are very active. 
Implementing the principle of division and balance of powers, 
the Constitutional Court has begun its work. A multiparty 
system is emerging in society, while the government does not 
restrict the freedom of speech. The Seimas is debating the law 
on local self- governments, which defines their duties, 
responsibility, and relations with central bodies in a more 
detailed and stricter manner. We do not have any problems with 
either ethnic minorities or borders. We have adopted a law on 
investments favorable to foreign investors. We have curbed 
inflation. Lithuania has had a stable currency for a year, the 
viability of which is guaranteed by sufficient gold and hard 
currency resources. According to the statistics of 
representatives of the European Union [EU], privatization in 
Lithuania is the most rapid among all other Eastern and Central 
European countries. More than half of the employed population 
works in the nonstate sector. Living standards have stabilized 
after a four-year decline, even though they are not high. We 
have halted the dangerous rise in the crime rate. A stratum of 
active people with initiative is emerging in the process of 
reform. Certainly, all of this strengthens the foundation of 
democracy. 
  At the same time, we notice, however, that hidden 
unemployment is spreading in Lithuania. A considerably high 
crime rate infringes on citizens' rights and affects the 
development of market relations. Sometimes the freedom of speech 
also encounters economic problems, when it is necessary not only 
to publish but also to sell a newspaper, or to financially 
support an independent radio or television station. There are 
too many people living on the verge of poverty. The middle 
class is slow in emerging. The ill- considered reform in 
agriculture has produced very painful social and economic 
effects. The influx of foreign investments into Lithuania is 
overly slow. I regret that last fall, the Seimas failed to 
rally the qualified majority for the constitutional amendment 
allowing the sale of land to foreign investors. Under current 
Lithuanian law, foreigners can lease land for 99 years. 
  Seeing these troubles as typical of newly democratic states, 
we realize that thus far we have secured the irrevocability of 
reform. However, we have not yet achieved the stage in which 
reform, designed to create a social market, would become the 
source of wealth and progress for all citizens. Therefore, we 
will require much effort to escape impasse in the transitional 
period and the danger of returning to the autocratic rule common 
to Eastern and Central Europe between the wars. 
  Taking this opportunity, I would like to repeatedly express 
Lithuania's determination to sign the European (Association) 
Agreement with the EU as early as this year, which would become 
an unequivocal sign of support for our reform. It seems that 
this time we, the people from Eastern and Central Europe, must 
encourage Westerners for more resolute and powerful moves, and 
remind them that their hesitation and indecisiveness can again 
divide Europe and deprive us of our future. The time has come 
to welcome our future. The European Council seems to have been 
the first organization that had enough courage to greet and 
admit this future along with us, the newly democratic states. 
On behalf of Lithuania, I express my gratitude to the European 
Council, which rendered and continues to render vital support to 
the development of democratic traditions in our state. 
  European security is indivisible. Therefore, Lithuania's 
security is indivisible from that of Europe. On 27 January of 
this year, Lithuania joined the NATO "Partnership for Peace" 
program, stressing its goal -- from partnership to full NATO 
membership. It is important to note that Lithuania's 
cooperation is not and cannot be directed against any European 
state. Defense and political integration with Europe through 
cooperation with NATO and the West European Union will be 
impossible and unreal without the possibility of speeding up 
Lithuania's political and economic relations with the EU. 
  Good relations with neighbors is Lithuania's priority. Thus 
far, there have not been any serious reasons that could hamper 
Lithuania's good-neighborly relations with Russia, Poland, or 
Belarus. I say nothing about cooperation among the three Baltic 
states, where recently we have passed over from good intentions 
and projects to their implementation and the creation of 
relevant structures. The free-trade agreement among Lithuania, 
Estonia, and Latvia has come into effect. A unified visa space 
is emerging. The bodies of parliamentary cooperation are 
operating, while those of government cooperation are being 
created. Meetings among the presidents are held regularly. 
  The three Baltic states attach great importance to the 
expansion of cooperation with the five Nordic states according 
to the formula "3 plus 5," as well as with the states of the 
Baltic Sea region and Eastern and Central Europe. This complies 
with Lithuania's strategic foreign policy goals. 
  I assess the initialing of the Lithuanian-Polish treaty as 
a great political success. The treaty testifies to the growing 
mutual understanding between the two countries and nations, and 
provides a legal backdrop to our historical conflicts. The 
Lithuanians and the Poles, who had lived in one state in the 
Middle Ages, were divided by profound hostility in the first 
half of this century concerning the fate of Lithuania's capital 
Vilnius and its region. Echoes of this hostility are sometimes 
felt in society's moods and in statements by some politicians 
even today. I think that this agreement, which President L. 
Walesa and I will sign in 12 days in Vilnius, will allay the 
path of both countries to the new Europe and become a 
substantial contribution to the stability of the continent and 
the Stability Pact. The process of reconciliation, which began 
in Europe after World War II, is inexorably spreading from West 
to East. The place where this process would halt could, 
probably, mean an end to the Europe of the 21st century. In 
sight of the tragedies in the Caucasus and former Yugoslavia, 
which seemed to be impossible in the late ah century, we must 
find a more operative and effective possibility for utilizing 
the influence of international organizations, including that of 
the European Council. 
  Multilateral international cooperation is another level 
about 
which I would like to speak. Although Lithuania is not a large 
state in geopolitical terms, I believe that from most viewpoints 
all countries are relatively small today in comparison with the 
problems that have befallen Europe, the goals of universal 
integration, and the future perspective. Therefore, I fully 
support the idea of the French prime minister that there are no 
small or large states in Europe but that there are only partners 
of the common cause. I suppose that the European Council will 
have an exceptional role in Europe's architecture -- as a forum 
of equal pan-European states, an effective guarantor of states' 
commitments in the sphere of human rights, and a mechanism for 
implementing new initiatives. 
  The expansion of the European Council is another responsible 
task that emerges in projecting the new Europe and promoting 
political dialogue. I am certain that the compliance of 
candidates with the principles and standards of the European 
Council will be checked on very thoroughly, and that they will 
be rendered the necessary assistance in implementing these 
principles and standards. 
  The integration among the three Baltic states largely 
depends 
on Latvia's membership in the European Council. The ethnic 
situation in Latvia, which emerged over the period of Soviet 
occupation, is unique. However, the problems arising from it 
should not be the reason for delaying Latvia's full membership. 
  I suppose that Russia has a chance to implement democracy 
and 
escape the outbreak of dangerous imperial forces. Therefore, 
the procedure of Russia's membership begun by the Parliamentary 
Assembly implies political and moral support for the democratic 
forces of this country. The withdrawal of its Army from Latvian 
and Estonian territories by 31 August of this year would be a 
favorable reflection of Russia's intention to peacefully 
regulate its relations with neighbors. 
  At the same time, I would like to draw your attention to 
another trait in Russia's relations with neighbors that has 
become distinct recently. One had the impression in the second 
half of the past year that new relations based on constructive 
and mutually beneficial cooperation were emerging between 
Lithuania and Russia. As had been agreed, Russia withdrew its 
Army from Lithuania, and I met with President B. Yeltsin. 
Shortly thereafter, Russian Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin paid 
a visit to Vilnius where he signed 10 agreements. 
Unfortunately, the subsequent developments demonstrate that it 
is not so easy to change the established stereotypes in 
relations with smaller neighbors. The trade and economic 
agreement signed between Lithuania and Russia has not yet come 
into force due to the latter's position. Lithuania, as well as 
other Baltic states, is not included on the list of countries 
with which Russia concludes normal trade agreements. It would 
be important for us, and, I think, also for other European 
states, to know whether the aforementioned facts reflect the 
work style of Moscow's officials or its political line. It is 
regrettable that defending the Russian- speaking population by 
words, Russia is actually worsening the social situation of 
those citizens by applying economic levers against Lithuania. 
This will primarily halt large enterprises in Lithuania and 
other Baltic states, the output of which is largely exported to 
Russia and the workers of which are mostly Russian speakers. 
  In my opinion, Russia's principles in relations with 
neighbors should comply with universally acknowledged principles 
of international law. I think that Russia's respect for the 
sovereignty of the Baltic states, the rejection of the concept 
of "near abroad countries," and the execution of international 
agreements would speed up the decision of the European Council 
on this country's membership. The Baltic states and, I would 
suppose, the European Council would assess it as most positive 
if Russia's governmental institutions officially dissociated 
themselves from some political groups in the parliament and 
their statements negating the lawfulness of the independence of 
the Baltic states and the territorial inviolability of some 
European states. 
  Lithuania has a common border with Russia through 
Kaliningrad 
Oblast. Therefore, it is very important to us whether this 
region that used to be the military outpost of the former Soviet 
Union will gradually be demilitarized and will become a zone of 
active business. We feel positive efforts in this direction 
both from Moscow and Kaliningrad. However, sometimes one can 
notice the opposite tendencies as well. I think that Russia and 
its neighbors would be interested in attracting capital and 
various businessmen to this area, and in a larger role of 
international organizations there, particularly that of the EU. 
  Here is the last idea that I would like to share with you. 
Lithuania freed itself after 50 years of oppression. Therefore, 
the appeal that was voiced at the summit meeting of the European 
Council in Vienna urging to combat national egoism, ethnic 
hatred, racism, and anti-Semitism is very important to us. I 
can assure you on behalf of the Lithuanian leadership that we 
are strictly following this Vienna declaration. Lithuania can 
rightly take pride in the rational resolution of ethnic 
problems, including those of the Russian minority. It is 
strange that now and then we hear unfounded accusations against 
Lithuania, from both the Russian press and some politicians. 
The tradition of ethnic tolerance is viable in our country, and 
we are interested in its further promotion, particularly among 
young people. We can remember that not a single ethnic minority 
has disappeared in Lithuania over 600 years. 
  Another historical topic painful to all of us is linked with 
the Jewish genocide and the execution of the fascist regime in 
Lithuania during World War II. I mourn those numerous victims. 
I also regret the fact that some Lithuanians participated in 
punitive actions. Therefore, I state firmly that all criminals 
who have not yet been reached by the hand of justice must be 
exposed and punished. We are accomplishing this with 
consistency and calling on all interested organizations and 
individuals to cooperate with us. Maybe, not everything has 
been yet said about those tragic events. However, we are not 
afraid to speak about them, and with open hearts we seek mutual 
understanding both with Israel and the Jewish communities in our 
state and others. The firm basis for this is not only the 
centuries-old tradition of the Lithuanian and Jewish nations 
living together on the same land, but also the self-sacrifice of 
hundreds of Lithuanians in saving Jews persecuted during the 
war. Now that we have restored Lithuania's independence, we 
have accomplished much in rebuilding hundreds of Jewish 
graveyards and monuments, and granting possibilities for their 
cultural and educational activities. 
  Lithuania is working intensively to bring its laws in line 
with the European Council Convention on the Protection of Human 
Rights and Freedoms. The president's duty to submit 
international agreements for ratification, contained in the 
Constitution, has encouraged me to set up a group that engages 
in active work and cooperates with European Council experts. 
Being fully aware of your constant attention and the fixed 
limit of the "proper period," I will assure the most rapid 
ratification of this convention. By joining conventions that 
constitute the European Agreement System, Lithuania not only 
assumes new commitments but also acquires new possibilities. 
Integration with this system is one of our state's priority 
goals. 
  Lithuania realizes the importance of its state commitments 
to 
the international community, and primarily to its people. The 
exceptional significance of the European Council in Europe's 
current changes repeatedly proves that the human dimension is 
the basis for the lives and reinforcement of all democratic 
states.

<F P=106> [Andrey Lekant report in the "Counterattack" column: "Petr </F>
Filippov Is Awaiting Resignation"] 
  [Text] Petr Filippov, former chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet's Privatization Subcommittee, is to face an official 
investigation initiated by presidential administration chief 
Sergey Filatov. Administration officials reported that Mr. 
Filippov is likely soon to resign from the post of chief of the 
presidential administration's Information Support Directorate. 
  As SEGODNYA has learned, the reason for the inquiry was the 
analytical materials worked out under Filippov's supervision, 
containing recommendations for reorganizing large agricultural 
enterprises and supporting collective peasant farms. The 
authors of the memorandum propose the voluntary breakup into 
smaller units and sale of the land and property of corporatized 
kolkhozes at internal auctions, and using them to create small 
-- approximately 30 people -- peasant farms. 
  The preparation of corresponding normative documents took 
two 
and a half months and was of a planned character. The authors 
thought that if a decision about a presidential edict or 
government decree was adopted on this subject, they could be 
released this fall. As is apparent from the content of these 
documents, they are of a purely recommendatory character and 
could be addressed only to two persons: presidential 
administration chief Sergey Filatov and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. The latter, however, deemed it necessary to 
transfer them to Agriculture Minister Khlystun, who in his turn 
forwarded them to Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Duma's agrarian 
faction. From that point on the documents finally lost their 
confidential character, were duplicated and circulated to "all 
rural councils." 
  The agriculture generals assessed the recommendatory service 
memoranda as guidance for action. According to some Directorate 
officers, they demanded explanations from the president and the 
prime minister, and from Sergey Filatov, an official 
investigation and punishment of the guilty. 
  The outcome of the battle between the agrarian lobby and 
Petr 
Filippov arouses practically no doubt in Staraya Ploshchad.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Tyshkevich article: "Their Drugs Barons Will Not </F>
Turn Up in the Russian Market. We Have Enough of Our Own" -- 
from the "Retsept" section] 
  [Text] We have recently seen in the mass media 
increasingly frequent forecasts that Russia is destined to turn 
more or less into an international market for the sale of drugs 
in the near future. How accurate is this claim? Let us turn 
for comment to criminal specialists engaged in this area and 
doctors specializing in drug abuse, and also see what some 
foreign publications have to say. 
  In the opinion of experts from the Russian MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] Department for Struggle Against the Spread of 
Drugs, the appearance of international criminal syndicates in 
our country's market in the near future is impossible for two 
reasons. First, the prices for the imported "goods" are so high 
that they will be beyond the domestic "consumer's" reach: For 
example, a gram of cocaine costs about $100. Second, Russia and 
the CIS countries are themselves capable of becoming vendors of 
the raw materials for drugs production and are already doing so: 
For example, Chu and Amur hemp, from which hashish is made, 
differs very little in its properties from the equivalent 
commodity which the international cartels are buying up in the 
countries of the "golden triangle." 
  Apart from this, Russian drugs dealers are not allowing 
their 
foreign competitors to penetrate their market: After all, drug 
dealing is becoming one of the most profitable businesses, 
ranking second after arms dealing. What is more, we are talking 
not just about natural substances but also about synthetic drugs 
used in medicine. 
  There are quite a few confirmations of this. You only have 
to recall the "Olaynfarm" [name as transliterated] affair which 
caused a sensation some time ago. Invar Penke [name as 
transliterated], director of the collapsed pharmaceutical giant, 
began to produce amphetamine, a stimulant which is classified as 
a narcotic all over the world. Then the unlicensed sale of this 
drug to Germany began. As a result Penke was arrested by 
Interpol's German agency. A second example is this: A St. 
Petersburg medicinal compounds plant mastered the industrial 
production of ephedrine -- a drug for asthmatics from which you 
can make a cheap narcotic, the so-called "dzhef" [an ephedrine 
derivative], at home. 
  The following is a very recent example. Not long ago, in the 
settlement of Kupavna (Moscow Oblast), the garage of Ivan 
Tyulyayev, director of the "Akrikhin" Chemical and 
Pharmaceutical Combine, burned down. Before this, several 
attacks had been made on his property, and there are always 
these genuine, imported mafia cars with their zonked young 
drivers parked outside the plant. Ivan Ivanovich himself stated 
to the militia on several occasions that he is being threatened 
and pushed into illegal activities. 
  All these details were received from the MVD. 
  But what are Western journalists writing about this matter 
of 
concern to us? The following details are to be found in the 
journal MEDICINE REVIEW. It emerges that cheap and particularly 
toxic drugs of unknown origin -- hallucinogens as a rule -- have 
recently been appearing on the U.S. and European drugs markets. 
The number of cases of clinical intoxication has increased with 
their appearance. The article also presents figures: The 
number of people poisoned by narcotic substances in the United 
States rose from 1,234 a month (in 1985) to 10,345 people a 
month (in 1992 when, it is believed, a massive expansion of the 
narcotics market began from CIS countries). 
  But their drug addicts are ultimately their own problem. But 
to what degree are the rumors about the spread of their opium to 
our market justified? From a set of figures provided to us by 
the State Drug-Abuse Center, you can clearly discern the group 
of users of this potion in this country. On the whole what we 
have here are examples of multiple drug addiction. Moreover, 
our drug addicts use substances whose narcotic properties are 
simply beyond the imagination of people in the West. So the 
doctors' opinion coincides precisely with that of the law 
enforcement agencies -- the Medellin or any other cartel will 
never break into the Russian market as a vendor.

  [Text] The group seeking to create an Accord for Russia 
Movement did not discuss whether the former Russian 
vice-president, Aleksandr Rutskoy, will be the leader of the 
Movement, one of the Movement organizers, member of the Russian 
Constitutional Court, Valery Zorkin said Monday. He was 
speaking in an interview with INTERFAX concerning Rutskoy's 
Sunday TV interview where the latter said that he was prepared 
to be the opposition leader. 
  Zorkin said that while constructive forces have no clear 
program and no concrete measures to overcome the crisis, it 
would be absurd to speak about someone coming to save everyone. 
People should unite and choose their leader themselves, said 
Zorkin. He believes that the treaty on civic accord should also 
be based on an initiative from "below". 
  Speaking about the essence of the treaty, Zorkin said that 
the document should be based on an agreement on principles of 
overcoming the crisis. Only then the existing institutes will 
win the people's confidence. Zorkin said that it was the 
question of power institutes not of individuals. Certain 
personal changes in the power structures are possible, he 
believes. 
  Zorkin also said that it was not legitimate to raise the 
question of whether Accord for Russia would sign a treaty on 
civic accord in the Kremlin on April 28, since the Movement had 
not yet been created. He said that the constituent conference 
of the Accord for Russia Movement is scheduled for mid-May.

led by Vasily Lipitsky and informally by Alexander Rutskoy, who 
left the party after the October events of 1993 in Moscow, will 
enter the Russia's Choice Party organized by Yegor Gaydar, the 
former co- chairman of the Popular Party Free Russia Aleksandr 
Sharavin told Interfax. 
  He said that in ten districts of Moscow members of the party 
joined the organizing committees of the Russia's Choice Party, 
which set the date of its constituent congress for the end of 
May - beginning of June. 
  According to Sharavin, the regional organization of the 
Popular Party Free Russia in Astrakhan, Izhevsk, Severodvinsk, 
Ulan-Ude, Nizhny Novgorod, Omsk, Tver, Yekaterinburg and other 
cities supported the idea of their structures' entry into the 
Gaydar party. 
  Press secretary of the Russia's Choice faction in the State 
Duma Anna Tyagunenko told Interfax that Yegor Gaydar has no 
objections to the shift of former supporters of Aleksandr 
Rutskoy to the Russia's Choice Party, although, in her words, 
Gaydar notes a certain awkwardness in the situation.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 -- Co-chairmen of the Democratic 
Russia Political Movement Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin sent on 
Monday an open letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin with a 
suggestion that he put off the signing of the memorandum on 
civic peace and accord, which is scheduled for April 28. 
  The Democratic Russia leaders justified their position by 
referring to an article published by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in 
the liberal daily paper IZVESTIYA. They said the nationalist 
leader's article contained expansionist desires and 
anti-constitutional appeals. Expressing their opposition to 
"civic accord" with Zhirinovskiy, the Democratic Russia leaders 
said he should either publicly renounce the anti-constitutional 
appeals or not be allowed to sign the treaty.

Yeltsin Has Met With Yuriy Skokov. Consultations Between the 
Russian Federation President and the Leader of the Commodity 
Producers Federation Will Be Regular"] 
  [Text] On 22 April a meeting took place in the Kremlin 
between Boris Yeltsin and Yuriy Skokov, which lasted more than 
an hour. 
  As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reported earlier, the Russian 
Commodity Producers Federation [RCPF], led by Skokov, has worked 
out a number of proposals aimed at taking immediate measures to 
salvage domestic industrial and agricultural production. The 
RCPF initiatives have found a response not only in Russia but 
also abroad. During Yuriy Skokov's visits to Germany and France 
representatives of the government and the business community of 
those countries accepted the RCPF's proposal to conclude 
agreements with major employers associations in these states. 
The agreements should become the basis for a system of 
nongovernment interaction between Russian and foreign 
manufacturers. 
  In its report NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA wrote about the message 
sent by Yuriy Skokov to the president of Russia. In it, the 
RCPF chairman presented proposals for organizing a system of 
interaction between the federation and the government to 
elaborate and implement concrete joint projects. After studying 
the message, Boris Yeltsin tasked Viktor Chernomyrdin with 
setting up cooperation with the RCPF in order to overcome the 
catastrophic production decline and to slow down the growth of 
unemployment. 
  In addition to the RCPF's proposals to defend the interests 
of domestic commodity producers, the meeting between Boris 
Yeltsin and Yuriy Skokov last Friday also discussed a broad 
range of socioeconomic problems. Yeltsin related with 
understanding to Skokov's concern over the position of Russia's 
commodity producers. Accord was reached about regular 
consultations between the president of the Russian Federation 
and the RCPF leader and their collaboration in addressing 
Russia's economic problems. 
  It is noteworthy that at the request of Boris Yeltsin's 
press 
service the meeting was filmed by a TV crew. Footage of it, 
however, only appeared in an NTV news program. Neither 
Ostankino nor Russian TV reported the meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "The Central </F>
Bank of Russia: What Next?"] 
  [Text] None of the state's economic institutions today is 
more important than the Central Bank. Some five years ago 
hardly anyone knew its chairman's name, whereas now it has 
become a political office attracting universal attention. 
  The only question now is: To what extent does the Central 
Bank perform its functions which, in the conditions of market 
economy, are always extremely simple -- to ensure the stability 
of the currency and the stability of the banking system. 
Stability of the currency means low inflation and a stable 
exchange rate. Stability of the banking system means the 
absence of defrauding of clients and the stability of banks. 
  No country in the world has a stable currency with a weak 
economy. On the other hand, most countries with weak currencies 
have very weak economies. It is obvious that today we fall 
within the second group and the length of time we will spend in 
this group depends largely on the Central Bank. 
  A sound way of boosting the Central Bank's activeness in 
this 
sphere has been devised in New Zealand -- the Central Bank 
chairman's salary there is linked to the level of inflation. 
The lower the inflation, the higher the salary; the higher the 
inflation, the lower the salary. There we have some food for 
thought. 
  The Central Bank's independence is a key question. The 
Germans had a taste of hyperinflation in the wake of two world 
wars, and no Central Bank is stronger or more independent than 
Germany's. The independence question was widely discussed in 
our country in 1989-1990, but independence was in fact replaced 
by excessive dependence on parliament and -- frequently -- by 
irresponsibility. I recently read a report analyzing the link 
between the level of inflation since the beginning of this 
century and the Central Bank's status. Thus, we are a unique 
country where greater independence for the Central Bank means 
higher inflation. 
  I am reluctant to draw the conclusion that we have not yet 
fully experienced the "wonders" of hyperinflation. I am in 
principle against any form of subordination of the Central Bank 
to either the government or the parliament. Both are equally 
bad, politicians should not interfere with professionals 
provided, of course, that they are professionals and are 
accurately performing their functions. 
  In our case it is necessary to change the system of running 
the Central Bank so as to reduce the likelihood of dangerous and 
unlawful decisions. On the one hand, there must be a 
supervisory council -- a "political" organ comprising 
representatives of the banking system, industry, and trade, 
which would make key decisions of monetary, credit, and banking 
policy. On the other hand -- a board of directors as an organ 
for daily leadership of the bank's activity which would prepare 
all basic decisions. Collective and professional leadership 
should protect the economy against arbitrariness. Such a system 
exists in all countries in the world. 
  Furthermore, it is necessary to render banking legislation 
as 
detailed as possible, and it must be operating directly, ruling 
out any free interpretation and precisely defining normatives 
and their limits, the instruments of policy, and the Central 
Bank's mutual relations with the government and other 
institutions of power. Nowadays hardly anyone in the country has 
any accurate knowledge about questions affecting the lives of 
each and every one of us. 
  I fear that many people have an incorrect perception of the 
idea of a federal reserve system. The specific U.S. system is 
"federal" on the surface, but the United States does have a 
unified policy, all decisions are made in Washington and there 
can be no autonomization. Any experiments with a total 
restructuring of the banking system can bring more harm than 
good. 
  On the other hand, it is time to say honestly that the 
processes now under way in several republics within Russia are 
extremely dangerous. The redesignation of the Central Bank's 
territorial organs as national banks, the adoption of their own 
banking laws, and the demands for greater autonomy and 
regionalization of monetary policy -- all these are signs of 
separatism. Therefore, there is perfect justification for 
creating territorial organs of the Central Bank in economic 
regions comprising several Federation components. Such organs 
would exercise greater powers and would be less dependent on 
local authorities. 
  Another problem facing the Central Bank is its withdrawal 
from the sphere of commercial activities. This means 
liquidating its holdings in former Soviet banks abroad, the 
Foreign Trade Bank of Russia, the Bank for Labor Savings and 
Credit to the Population, and the Sovfintrade [expansion 
unknown]. It is impermissible to mix the functions of banking 
regulation with direct involvement in business dealings -- this 
creates a conflict of interests. Another aspect of the question 
is the persistent desire of former Gosbank [USSR State Bank] 
officials to remain involved in credit facilities for the 
economy under the cover of conducting operations through 
commercial banks. I am profoundly convinced that, for as long 
as central bankers engage in business, they will not tackle 
monetary and credit policy. 
  It is obvious that the current law on the Central Bank is 
outdated and we can no longer remain satisfied with cosmetic 
amendments to the legislation. A new law on the Central Bank is 
needed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Which Banker Lacks a Billion?"] </F>
  [Text] The Fourth Congress of the Association of Russian 
Banks concluded its work in Moscow yesterday. Perhaps none of 
the spheres of the market infrastructure is developing as 
swiftly as the credit-monetary sphere. There is a total of 
2,041 banks in Russia today, with over 4,000 branches. And 
sizeable funds are in circulation in them -- the total assets of 
commercial banks exceed 110 trillion rubles [R]. 
  However, both the association's President Sergey Yegorov and 
the bankers from the localities who addressed the congress spoke 
less about the prosperity of financial affairs, and more, 
strangely enough, about the threat to them posed by the state. 
Such as, for example, the recent directive on increasing income 
tax fivefold in comparison with the first quarter of last year. 
Thus, we are not far from utter ruin. 
  Businessmen are also skeptical about the authorities' 
decision to increase the minimum amount of the authorized 
capital for new banks to R2 billion. Such money is not 
available, particularly in the provinces, which is precisely 
where there is an acute need for the creation of new structures. 
  Speaking at the congress, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets 
announced a project which envisages a significant increase in 
banks' contributions to investment purposes. And Central Bank 
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko promised to reduce the discount 
rate in the near future, although admittedly on certain 
conditions.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Preliminary marine pollution 
measurements taken from the sites of radioactive waste dumping 
by the former Soviet Union and Japan in the Sea of Japan did not 
reveal any Caesium-137 radioactive level fluctuations. These 
preliminary conclusions were reached at the end of the joint 
Russian-Japanese- South Korean expedition' first stage, which 
was undertaken with the participation of IAEA (International 
Atomic Energy Agency) specailists from March 18 to April 15. 
  The Russian Navy press centre told ITAR-TASS that the tests 
were conducted on board the Russian hydrometeorological 
scientific reasearch ship "Okean" (ocean). The expedition 
helped obtain information about the real radioactivity and 
ecological situation in the areas of radioactive waste dumping 
by the navy of the former Soviet Union and Russia. 
  Detailed analyses of sea water samples, sea bottom 
sediments, 
animal plankton and organisms living on the sea bottom, will be 
carried out in laboratories of Russia, Japan, South Korea and 
IAEA and published as a complete report within one year at the 
end of the expedition.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov report: "Security Council Takes a Closer </F>
Look at Information"] 
  [Text] In its meeting yesterday the Russian Federation 
Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission on Information 
Security considered the fundamentals of a concept of the same 
name. Its authors expect that the information security concept 
will be finalized by November, but even at this stage they 
kindly suggested that the press familiarize themselves with its 
basic provisions. 
  According to Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of the 
Security Council, without an "adequate solution" to information 
problems "it is hard to talk about national security." Among 
such problems Mr. Rubanov mentioned the exercise of the 
citizens' right to information. "This problem should be 
resolved for political reasons" at least because these rights of 
citizens have been set forth in the Constitution, "but the 
existing structures cannot ensure them." 
  Mr. Rubanov said also that for the purpose of protecting 
Russia's intellectual potential a possibility should finally be 
given "to registering information as a commodity." Among other 
things, the draft concept calls for the recognition of 
information as an object of ownership and its introduction in 
"economic circulation." 
  In addition, Mr. Rubanov called for a conception of 
"protectionism" in the area of production and distribution of 
information, warning that far from all distributors of 
information, including a number of firms specializing in data 
bases, act "in conformity with Russia's vital interests." In 
other words, the state is seriously concerned by the leakage of 
formerly secret materials of scientific-technical or economic 
nature to its "partners," former opponents of the USSR. The 
Security Council will apparently urge the introduction of 
licenses and certificates for the distributors of information, 
particularly exporters. 
  It seems encouraging that the Security Council, at least the 
part of its staff that deals with working out the information 
security concept, thinks it necessary publicly to declare that 
if citizens are to exercise their constitutional right to 
information, it requires appropriate legislation, including 
direct-action laws. Just as important, information has been 
introduced "in economic circulation" as "a crucial national 
resource comparable with energy resources" (in Mr. Rubanov's 
words). Maybe this will correct to some extent the usage of the 
term "commodity producer," which is currently applied to those 
who produce "material values," not to designate those who 
actually manufacture marketable products. 
  Naturally, the preliminary presentation of the concept has 
also left numerous questions unanswered. According to Mr. 
Rubanov, power structures will have an "auxiliary role" to play 
when the concept and enforceable enactments on its basis are 
worked out. If this is really so, so modest a role for the 
special services will be a first, of sorts. Of course, one will 
be able to find out how "auxiliary" it is only when private and 
commercial producers and buyers of information face the 
consequences of this idea in practice. 
  For the time being, however, materials presented showed the 
desire to pass "between the Scylla of secrecy and the Charybdis 
of misappropriating information resources with no holds barred." 
Since the drafters of the concept concede that it would be more 
advantageous for the state to establish "a high level of 
secrecy," the other components of society should evidently 
champion the "no- holds-barred" approach, so as not to veer off 
toward Scylla.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Russia needs to create a 
general informational defence system, according to Deputy 
Secretary of the Russian Security Council Vladimir Rubanov. He 
stressed to ITAR-TASS that computer crimes themselves are 
capable of causing as much monetary damage as all the art thefts 
in the entire world. The most danger is represented by attempts 
to penetrate the networks controlling energy systems, the 
production of dangerous substances, and the use and control of 
troops and weapons, Rubanov said. 
  Some of the state's top-priority tasks in the information 
security field concern the defence of personal informational 
rights and intellectual property, the official said. Special 
attention should be paid to preventing the distortion, 
concealment, and destruction of information. Leaks of 
information representing state secrets must likewise not be 
tolerated. Adherence to such guidelines is designed to ensure 
information security in the political, economic, military, and 
other essential spheres of Russia's activity, Rubanov explained. 
  Important steps towards the defence of security contained in 
and transmitted by computers will be personal access devices 
which identify the user of a computer and the quick-acting 
algorythyms in the cryptographic programme "electronic 
signature". If these defence measures are not taken advantage 
of, computer crimes could block the work of Russia's banking 
systems, as exemplified by the recent attempt to steal 68 
billion roubles through the Russian Central Bank's computer 
system. 
  The Russian Federation's conception of information security, 
which was examined by the Security Council Inter-Departmental 
Commission on Monday, should be considered an integral part of 
the country's system of national security, Rubanov declared.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The goal of the command and 
staff "north-west" war games, which began on Monday in Russia's 
Kalinigrad region and the Leningrad military district, is to 
perfect the ability of command and staff officers to direct 
their units. ITAR-TASS was told by the Defence Ministry's press 
bureau that the exercises, run by Russian Chief of General Staff 
Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, will last until April 29. 
  According to military sources, the exercises are meant to 
check the military capabilities of the troops stationed in the 
Kaliningrad region in particular. Earlier, those troops had 
"powerful back-up in the rear, but have now ended up surrounded 
by states whose policies concerning Russia are not always 
clear", the source said. 
  This spring is full of army and naval training exercises. 
Large- scale tactical maneuvers were held in Tajikistan. The 
"Pomor-94" naval exercises were held in the Barents Sea, and 
Russian-American- Canadian "Arctic-Sarex" war games were held in 
Alaska. Eastern Siberia was host to the "Baykal" command and 
staff exercises. Over- all, by the end of 1994 will have been 
held three exercise programmes for the strategic nuclear forces 
and more than ten in the operational and tactical fields. 
  Such an intense schedule of military exercises is designed, 
according to Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, "to maintain the 
battle-readiness of the Army and the power of the Navy, and to 
further develop the coordination of the commanding staff and 
troops, especially those that have been withdrawn from abroad 
back onto Russian territory".

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "General Grachev Sees No Tragedy </F>
in Breakdown of Sevastopol Talks"] 
  [Text] "The dividing up of the Black Sea Fleet, in my 
view, is part of the election campaign, and it is impossible to 
resolve this problem until the presidential elections in 
Ukraine," Russian Defense Minister Army General P. Grachev 
stated in answer to a question from your IZVESTIYA correspondent. 
  On his return to Moscow from Sevastopol, where he headed 
Russia's official delegation at the talks with Ukraine on the 
problem of dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, the general held a 
press conference for Russian and foreign journalists. Grachev 
described the Ukrainian delegation's stance vis-a-vis Russia as 
discriminatory. 
  Kiev proposed creating a base for the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet, which, as is well known, includes 85 percent of the 
fleet's ships and craft, in a small coastal settlement. Kiev's 
representatives also refused to discuss dividing up the fleet's 
infrastructure, namely bases, aircraft, airfields, depots, and 
shore units, without which the fleet cannot exist. Moreover, 
the Ukrainian military proposed that Russian ships should put to 
sea and return only via a single channel, each time securing the 
Ukrainian side's permission three days in advance. 
  The Russian defense minister said that his department has no 
confrontation with the Ukrainian military. No tragedy occurred. 
Russia expressed its viewpoint and listened to the Ukrainian 
side's position, and let the presidents now put the military 
right. The two sides simply must resolve the problem on a 
compromise basis in the interests of both countries, their 
peoples, and the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Russia's position is this: We must continue the talks, set 
up a state commission under the leadership of the prime 
ministers or their first deputies, and include in the delegation 
not only military men and diplomats, but also specialist 
economists, financiers, and others.

  [Text] Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral Eduard 
Baltin said he was surprised by Ukrainian politicians' 
statements that a third party should be involved in tackling the 
Black Sea Fleet problem (the U.S.--Interfax). He told Interfax 
that he categorically opposed the idea of involving Washington 
in this dispute. 
  "To begin with, this is Russia's problem. Historically, it 
is Russia that is conducting talks with Ukraine. So Russia will 
hardly put up with the idea of American participation," he said. 
  Speaking about the talks on the Black Sea Fleet between the 
Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers, Baltin said that Kiev 
had interpreted the Moscow agreement between the Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents in its own way and violated one of its 
basic provisions on the separate location of the Russian and 
Ukrainian headquarters. The presence of the Ukrainian and 
Russian headquarters in Sevastopol would destabilize the 
situation in the city and complicate the work of the personnel, 
he said. 
  Such a situation may entail unpredictable consequences, he 
added. 
  To quote Baltin, behind the Ukrainian position is the lack 
of 
money for the construction of its own naval base. "It is much 
easier to live at someone else's expense," he said. 
  Commenting on the allegations that Russia scuppered the 
talks, he said that "attack is the best form of defense." 
"Obviously, Kiev has taken this saying to heart," he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- "Ukrainians have undertaken 
a series of measures against the Russian personnel of the Black 
Sea Fleet which are impossible to call friendly or 
constructive", ITAR-TASS was told in the Black Sea Fleet press 
centre on Monday. 
  The fleet representative reported that, in particular, one 
of 
the Ukrainian naval groups, stationed on Cape Khersones, held 
military exercises in which a Russian regiment was considered as 
the "potential enemy". 
  After the end of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in 
Sevastopol 
on dividing the Black Sea Fleet, Ukrainian military leaders have 
increased their pressure on Russian personnel under their 
command to take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine, the 
representative said. They are using not only blackmail and 
threats, but lures of promotions in the Ukrainian Navy and a 
respectable increase in pay. 
  The Russian Black Sea Fleet press centre thinks that the 
Ukrainian naval officers are acting against the official 
position of the Ukrainian Government, which has often repeated 
its commitment to a civilized settlement of the Black Sea Fleet 
problem.

  [Text] In Sevastopol the Russian and Ukrainian negotiating 
teams have agreed, according to the commander-in-chief of the 
Russian Navy Felix Gromov, that 100 of the Black Sea Fleet's 143 
war ships will belong to Russia and the remaining 43 to Ukraine. 
  The negotiating teams led by Defense Ministers Pavel Grachev 
and Vitaliy Radetskyy, met on April 21 and 22. It was agreed, 
in principle, that Ukraine would own 164 vessels, or 18.3 
percent, of the Fleet, and Russia -- the remaining 669 of the 
Fleet's 833 ships and support boats. 
  In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX Gromov said the 
vessels' age, cost and class were taken into consideration. On 
its own suggestion Ukraine would have more ships than previously 
planned (more than 18.3 pct of the Fleet's total strength) but 
its ships would be of a lower class, whereas Russia would have 
more first and second class vessels -- destroyers and large 
antisubmarine boats. 
  The antisubmarine cruiser Moskva with the deadweight of 
18,000 tonnes, is the Fleet's biggest ship. It is to belong to 
Russia. The biggest ship Ukraine is to have, is Getman 
Sagaidachni with the deadweight of some 4,500 tonnes. 
  Gromov said that under the Yeltsin-Kravchuk Massandra 
agreement the Fleet's aircraft are to belong to Russia.

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- President Yeltsin's visit to 
Ukraine is not on his immediate agenda, presidential press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov says in a statement forwarded to 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  The statement says: "The mass media has reported with 
references to diplomatic sources that considered at present `is 
the possibility of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Ukraine' and that `the problem of the Black Sea Navy could be 
discussed at a possible meeting between the Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents'." 
  In connection with this, Kostikov explained that "Boris 
Yeltsin regards the situation in quite another sequence. 
Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine is not on the president's immediate 
agenda. Yeltsin believes it is first necessary to resolve the 
Black Sea Navy problem proceeding from the fundamental agreement 
on separate naval bases. After this problem is settled and a 
political climate of trust and dependability is created, it is 
necessary to draw up a full-scale treaty, which is to open up 
prospects for the Russian president's visit to Kiev," says the 
statement of the presidential press secretary.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- A high-ranking NATO official 
said the alliance is going to closely cooperate with Moscow in 
solving the Bosnian crisis. 
  "The North Atlantic Alliance intends to closely cooperate 
with Russia" in solving the Bosnian crisis, Gebhardt von Moltke, 
NATO deputy secretary general for political issues, told TASS on 
Monday, adding that NATO welcomes all initiatives undertaken by 
the USA, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. 
  "It is absolutely clear that it is imsposible to ensure 
security in Europe and in the world without Russia -- a major 
Euro-Asian power", he stressed. 
  "That is why we would welcome and expect that Russia joins 
the (NATO) Partnership for Peace plan whose participants will 
share responsibility for ensuring a just and lasting peace", von 
Moltke said. 
  He is heading a NATO delegation which participates in the 
international conference "Russia and NATO: Security in

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- "Active work, both by special 
representatives for the former Yugoslavia and by the foreign 
ministers of Russia, the United States, and EC with UN 
participation," is called for to lay the basis for a summit 
meeting on a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be held in the 
near future. This is set out in a statement released here today 
by the Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman. 
  "We expect both the Bosnian parties and our partners working 
to achieve a settlement to be actively involved in this 
process," the document stresses. The stance taken by the 
Russian Foreign Ministry is expressed once again in the 
statement: "Despite the complexity of the situation, military 
measures should not mask the main thing -- policies to bring 
about a political settlement."

  [Text] Moscow has put forward new proposals for a 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "A meeting of the (U.N.) Security Council convened at the 
initiative of Russia has decided that the decisions made by NATO 
in response to the request of the U.N. secretary general to 
protect Gorazde and other 'safe havens' in Bosnia were correct," 
a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement issued 
in Moscow on Monday. "Grave as the present situation is, 
military measures must not replace the principal line, that 
towards a peaceful settlement. We expect that the Bosnian 
parties and our partners seeking a settlement will be actively 
involved in the process." 
  Russia's settlement program has the following principal 
elements, the spokesman said: 
  1. Tighter regulations for safe havens in Bosnia on the 
basis of U.N. Security Council decisions. 
  2. An agreement between Serbs and Muslims for an indefinite 
and universal cease-fire. Such a document has already been 
drafted and must be signed as soon as possible without any 
reservations. All parties to the conflict must realize that the 
international community will tolerate no more provocations or 
barbaric responses to them. Both mean disregard for the United 
Nations. 
  3. Embarking on a comprehensive peaceful settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a decision must take account of the 
legitimate interests and equal rights of all three peoples of 
Bosnia. A Muslim-Croat federation would form no basis for the 
future of the Bosnian Serbs. The sharing of territory must be 
based on earlier plans and be carried out only by negotiation. 
A political agreement must naturally involve all humanitarian 
aspects of the Bosnian problem. 
  4. Progress towards peace in Bosnia must be accompanied by 
weaker sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  "There is a need for active work both on the part of special 
envoys to the former Yugoslavia and on the part of the foreign 
ministers of Russia, the United States and the European Union, 
with the participation of the United Nations. This would 
provide a basis for convening in the near future a summit on a 
settlement in Bosnia," the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov report under the "Bosnia" rubric: "Chances </F>
of Peaceful Settlement Are There. Success Is Expected if 
Movement Toward Settlement Proceeds in Two Parallel Courses"] 
  [Excerpts] The NATO ultimatum seems to have once again 
demonstrated its effectiveness as a peacekeeping tool. 
Yesterday, the Bosnian Serbs continued the pullout of heavy 
arms from Gorazde. Although Russian Federation Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev remarked yesterday that these actions were at 
least one week late, one still should not underestimate the 
importance of this fact. [passage omitted] 
  In regard to Vitaliy Churkin's words heard in the Sunday 
television program "Itogi," Kozyrev said that the constant 
rotation of Russian ambassadors is a style normal for the 
Foreign Ministry's work, but Churkin has yet to work on settling 
the Yugoslav crisis. 
  The threat of new NATO strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions 
still remains. At the same time, the current diplomatic 
activity by the world community leaders opens ways for the 
resumption of the interrupted negotiating process.

Solovyev, including recording of interview with N. Bezborodov, 
head of Russian State Duma delegation; from the "Novosti" 
newscast] 
  [Text] [Solovyev] For over three days the first official 
delegation of the Russian State Duma to former Yugoslav 
republics has been continuing its familiarization with the 
details of the Balkan tragedy. After a number of meetings in 
the Yugoslav capital at the weekend, the deputies visited Pale 
and Sarajevo where they held consultations with leaders of the 
Bosnian Serbs and Sarajevo Muslims. They visited the Russian 
paratroop battalion in Grbavica, Sarajevo's Serb section. Today 
the parliamentarians saw Vukovar -- a Yugoslav Stalingrad -- and 
Klisa, the main base of the Russian contingent of blue helmets. 
  [Bezborodov] We believe that the initiative put forward now 
by Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin must be urgently 
discussed. It is a question of holding a conference attended by 
Russia, the United States, the United Nations, the European 
Union, and the parties to the conflict, in order to sit at the 
negotiating table as soon as possible and to solve all the 
disputes peacefully. 
  [Solovyev] Some members of the Russian delegation took a 
special UN flight to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, today. The 
Russian deputies are to meet Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Eleven Russian observers who 
served at U.N. mission's civil police in former Yugoslavia, 
returned to Moscow on Monday. They monitored movements of 
humanitarian cargoes, exchange of refugees and observance of 
human rights in that region in the framework of U.N. 
peace-keeping activities. 
  "Such practice exists at all the U.N. missions in various 
countries when civil police work along with military observers," 
Aleksandra Zemskova, representative of the Interior Ministry 
personnel department, told journalists later in the day. 
  Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo and Tuzla are some of the places 
where Russian observers work. Their first group was dispatched 
to the Balkans in the spring of 1992. Russian Interior Ministry 
staff members have been regularly relieving one another since 
that time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian President Boris Yeltsin by Joerg R. </F>
Mettke, Hans Werner Kilz, and Fritjof Meyer in Moscow; date not 
given: "Ready for Any Struggle"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Boris Nikolayevich, Russia has 
worked for the benefit of the Serbs in the Balkans, and the 
Serbs broke the agreements with your envoy. Do you feel cheated 
by the Serbs now? 
  [Yeltsin] I do have this feeling. Russia, the United 
States, and Germany have exerted their influence where they were 
listened to -- the Americans on the Muslims, the Germans on the 
Croats. We were the ones with the stronger influence on the 
Serbs. In this way we jointly prevented a harsh militant 
conflict. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But the Serbs have attacked Gorazde again and 
have not kept their promise. 
  [Yeltsin] I discussed the matter with Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
and suggested to convene a summit. Russia, the United States, 
the European Union, the United Nations, and the other sides 
should sit down together at a table somewhere in Europe to sign 
an agreement on a cease-fire and on peace after such an 
agreement has been prepared by the foreign ministers. Last 
night I had an extensive conversation with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And the result was? 
  [Yeltsin] Air raids can only worsen the situation, the war 
becomes endless. If we all exerted our influence as the 
guarantors of peace and could look into the eyes of the Yugoslav 
leaders, then a final agreement could be achieved. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you agree with Clinton or are there 
differences now? 
  [Yeltsin] Our relations are close, we are good partners. It 
is normal in the relations between two states that the positions 
do not fully concur on all issues. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, you are against bombings? 
  [Yeltsin] We have the experience in our CIS countries that 
any violence gives rise to counterviolence. The attempt to 
defuse the situation and to come to an agreement is better. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you would like a UN mandate for the CIS 
states? 
  [Yeltsin] The United Nations has refused to send its 
peacekeeping forces to the CIS. Therefore, this remains our 
task. The United Nations can just send observers, but we must 
send the troops -- to Georgia, Ossetia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, 
Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What could the Germans do in the Balkans? 
Should they also send soldiers? 
  [Yeltsin] We would welcome it very much if the Germans were 
able to use their soldiers as peacekeeping forces, not only in 
Yugoslavia. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For that the FRG would have to amend its 
constitution. Would you find it good if the Germans were freer 
in sending troops? 
  [Yeltsin] I would consider this the right path. This year, 
our army will finally withdraw from German territory. In 
return, so to speak, the German Army could also be used together 
with the UN peacekeeping forces in the CIS countries and thus 
take over an important and noble mission. After all, we are all 
Europeans. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you intervene in the Balkans -- to 
show Russia in the role of the superpower, or did you want to 
help your Slav brothers? 
  [Yeltsin] We let ourselves be guided by the final goal; we 
are referring to the UN resolutions and the decision by the 
Security Council. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the NATO offer of a "Partnership for Peace" 
still acceptable to you? 
  [Yeltsin] It is a fair offer, but some things still have to 
be clarified. We have a big army, just as NATO. We are willing 
to sign a partnership agreement, but, at the same time, we also 
want to negotiate an additional protocol with NATO about basic 
issues. Two formerly hostile blocks now want to cooperate 
militarily. This cannot happen completely without technical 
problems. We have other weapons systems, which are very 
different from those of NATO. Now they probably have to be 
harmonized. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Recently you have often complained that 
Russia's size is not sufficiently respected in the world. Where 
do you see discrimination against your country? 
  [Yeltsin] I can give you a long list. The Cocom Committee 
[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] has 
now been dissolved, but the Western countries immediately 
established other committees, which are to regulate controls of 
goods exports to the former socialist countries in a new way. 
Why is Russia not represented in these committees? We were not 
even invited to the preparations. This is unjust. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] A second example? 
  [Yeltsin] We are part of Europe, we have been a European 
state for centuries, even though part of our territory is in 
Asia. We have agreed with the European Union on signing an 
economic agreement. For our accession we first have to develop 
an economic model. However, for this purpose we would need a 
cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia. We 
have not made progress in this matter for a year now. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You and European Union Commission President 
Jacques Delors signed a declaration in Brussels last December.... 
  [Yeltsin] ....more and more conditions are put up that 
clearly discriminate against Russia. We do not demand 
preferential treatment, just the same rights as any other 
European country, even though Russia is a superpower. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Council of Europe does not want to 
accept Russia as a member because its democratic institutions 
have not been consolidated. The seven industrial powers do not 
want to have Russia in its G-7 club as long as the Russian 
market economy is so little developed. What is the basis of 
Russia's role as a superpower, apart from nuclear weapons? 
  [Yeltsin] I am for the complete destruction of nuclear 
powers. A dream of mankind would be fulfilled if we entered the 
21st century without nuclear powers. Russia can fully join in 
that. Russia remains a superpower also without nuclear weapons. 
Our greatness lies in tradition, in history, in our culture. I 
do not want to offend the Americans, but their history goes back 
only 200 years, while ours is millennia old. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this justify the claim of being a 
superpower? 
  [Yeltsin] There is our gigantic territory of 17 million 
square kilometers, our population of 150 million. And then the 
natural resources. Our country has everything that man needs 
for life. Our natural gas resources of trillions of cubic 
meters are sufficient of Russia and for all of Europe for a few 
centuries. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But the democratic institutions are still 
underdeveloped. 
  [Yeltsin] Certainly, Russia has to live up to the 
international standard there, too. It needs a mixed market 
economy. man's rights and freedoms must be respected and 
protected. This is the top priority of our Constitution. 
However, the decisive elements for our weight and our greatness 
are tradition, history, and culture. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This weight is largely bearing down on your 
neighbors in the CIS. Will Russia act as a power of order on 
the territory of the former Soviet Union also without a UN 
mandate? 
  [Yeltsin] This lies within the discretion of these states. 
Georgia wants the United Nations with its peacekeeping forces to 
bring about order in its conflict with Abkhazia. Russia is to 
provide some of the blue-helmet soldiers. We would be willing 
to do that. However, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali told me 
that this has no chance -- the United Nations can, at best, send 
observers and is grateful to Russia for its readiness to send 
soldiers there. According to this model, Russia could also act 
in other hot spots on the territory of the former Soviet Union. 
If the CSCE, the United Nations, and NATO joined in, we would 
simply have fewer problems. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many of the troops that have been withdrawn 
from Germany, are now stationed in Kaliningrad, in the former 
Koenigsberg. Why does Russia need such a powerful base there? 
Who is threatening this region? 
  [Yeltsin] No one is threatening this region. There were 
simply barracks vacant in Kaliningrad. With the help of the 
German side, apartments for soldiers are now being build in 
various places. Later on, some troops will be transferred from 
Kaliningrad further to the east. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You will come to Germany next month. 
Potential investors will want to hear something about 
guarantees -- against bureaucratic harassment, impounding, 
arbitrary taxing, extortion of protection money. What can you 
offer in this respect? 
  [Yeltsin] We have founded an insurance company, which is to 
insure private investors against political risks with government 
guarantees. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Like the Hermes insurance company in Germany? 
  [Yeltsin] Exactly. We have studied the experiences of 
Hermes and believe that we can use much of that. Of course, 
there are no government guarantees against economic risks 
anywhere in the world. Incompetent entrepreneurs will fall flat 
on their faces in our country just as elsewhere. Political 
risks, however, are to be compensated for. In Germany I will 
explain this extensively to private investors in mid-May. They 
must understand that they must not neglect the Russian market. 
This market is uniquely interesting for them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, production is still going down in 
Russia and enormous subsidies are being paid to prevent mass 
unemployment. What about your promise that the economy will 
experience an upswing now? 
  [Yeltsin] I expect a stabilization this year. For two 
months the inflation rate has been 8 to 10 percent and thus 
considerably lower than last year. The production decline has 
also slowed. The budget deficit is also lower than last year. 
Armament production is deliberately being reduced. In other 
fields of production we want to reach a normal level by the end 
of the year. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The country will become credit-worthy again? 
  [Yeltsin] A partial loan of $1.5 billion has just been 
approved by the IMF. In 1995, we want to fulfill the conditions 
for loans, too, so that we get further means from the G-7 -- 
perhaps then it will already be called G-8. This would 
alleviate the situation in our national economy and contribute 
to the stabilization of the ruble. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Because they have economic problems, the 
voters have defected in masses to the nationalist firebrand 
[Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir] Zhirinovskiy. Do you 
intend to continue floating above the political groups, or will 
a presidential party soon be established? 
  [Yeltsin] The president is elected by all the people and is 
responsible for every citizen, not just for the followers of his 
own party. However, I can, of course, express more liking for 
one party than for another or for Zhirinovskiy's party. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why is it not possible to form a coalition 
against the chauvinist Zhirinovskiy? Is the agreement of all 
groups on a national consensus regarding constitutional good 
behavior supposed to be a substitute for that? 
  [Yeltsin] This is indeed intended. This agreement has great 
political importance and we expect that its signing on 28 April 
by the president, the government, the parliamentary chambers, 
the political parties, and the regions can form the basis for a 
consensus among the citizens in Russia. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you understand the concern of many people 
after Zhirinovskiy's appearances in Western Europe, or do you 
think that the Western reaction is exaggerated? 
  [Yeltsin] I think that the West greatly overestimates this 
man. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the impression incorrect that Zhirinovskiy 
has a chance of becoming Russian president? 
  [Yeltsin] Completely incorrect. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Among the radical democrats in Moscow the 
terms "autumn of the patriarchs" and "Yeltsin stagnation" are 
circulating. Are you tired of your office? 
  [Yeltsin] It is a tough job to be Russia's president in such 
a period. In my new book "On the Razor's Edge" [as published] I 
try to describe this. But courage does not desert me. I am 
always eager for action, I am ready for any struggle. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Also beyond 1996? 
  [Yeltsin] I have committed myself to not talking about this 
issue. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Committed yourself to whom? 
  [Yeltsin] The people from my team tried to persuade me for 
some time to run again in 1996. I did not want to. Then we 
agreed on a compromise: We will not talk about this issue for 
two years. In 1996, the decision will depend on whether the 
reforms in Russia cannot be reversed anymore. If I see that 
things are improving in Russia, I can leave this office with a 
clear conscience and a raised head. If the difficulties have 
not yet been overcome, then everything has to be reconsidered, 
depending on the situation. So far, I stick to my previous 
decision. I expect that, in 1996, Russia will stand on firm 
legs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you see younger people in Russia's 
leadership, who can continue your policy and, at the same time, 
have enough charisma? 
  [Yeltsin] I see many who want to do that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Someone like General Rutskoy cannot become 
that anymore? 
  [Yeltsin] No, never. He is too narrow-minded. And since he 
became a criminal, he has lost his political profile. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you worried that a vacuum could develop? 
  [Yeltsin] Very much so. I am now looking for candidates who 
can make a serious claim to the president's office in 1996. But 
this will be extremely difficult. The people must get used to 
someone and gain trust. This is not so easy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In your book you write that there are 
situations in which one should actually have to apply a whip -- 
so that criminals, but also civil servants, stick to the laws. 
What other means can be used to establish a rule-of-law state? 
  [Yeltsin] All civilized countries of the world have followed 
the path of democracy, nothing must be invented anew. We have a 
Constitution, which has been brought about through a democratic 
referendum. We have elected our parliament democratically. 
More than 57 percent of those eligible to vote have elected 
their president. We have thrown the Communist ideology and the 
totalitarian state overboard. These are steps on the path 
toward democracy, even though we have not yet completed this 
path. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Very soon the last formerly Soviet troops will 
leave the former GDR [German Democratic Republic]. German- 
Russians relations thus gain a new quality. Do you believe that 
these could be special relations in the future? 
  [Yeltsin] Russians and Germans are the two largest peoples 
in Europe. There relations with each other are of quite 
decisive importance for the fate of the entire continent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What can the Germans do to support the reforms 
in Russia? 
  [Yeltsin] The Germans are already doing enough. May God 
give that other states of the G-7 will act in the same way. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have very close, friendly relations with 
Helmut Kohl -- not only in the sauna. 
  [Yeltsin] He is a very interesting man. One can discuss 
complicated political topics with him quite easily. We 
understand each other immediately. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are there any differences of opinion? 
  [Yeltsin] This is just natural, but each of us also 
understands these different positions. He says: In your 
situation you are doing the right thing. I often have to tell 
him the same: I would have done the same in your place. He 
emanates an incredible joie de vivre, optimism, and energy. 
Yes, I like Helmut Kohl a lot. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that he understands the Russian 
people? 
  [Yeltsin] This is my impression. In any case, he 
understands me rather well. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think he is a typical German? 
  [Yeltsin] I am not quite sure what a typical German is. Who 
is a typical Russian? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Yeltsin] Any person is a special type, unique. He has his 
nationality, but also his individuality. Everyone is rooted in 
the traditions of his people. One can see that Helmut Kohl is a 
German. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Boris Nikolayevich, thank you for this 
interview.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- "We are constantly coming back to 
the fundamentals of multilateral cooperation. We understand 
that we are to live together and therefore want stability and 
peace more than anything else," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said in conversation with Rasul Guliyev, chairman of 
Azerbaijani National Assembly, today. 
  Karabakh is our common sorrow. The Russian plan is as 
realistic as possible. We are offering an honest mediation 
together with the CSCE and the United Nations, Andrey Kozyrev 
noted. We can introduce CIS peacekeeping forces, and this will 
not mean a Russian military presence but a peacemaking 
operation, the Russian minister stressed. 
  Rasul Guliyev highly appraised the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's 
efforts. The Azerbaijani politician believes that economic 
interests should be at the basis of bilateral relations. "Of all 
CIS countries we have the deepest integration. Economic ties 
should be strengthened but for this the war must be stopped," 
Rasul Guliyev noted.

  [Text] Following the talks between Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and Chairman of the Azeri parliament Rasul 
Guliyev in Moscow on Monday the two sides agreed to modify the 
Russian plan for the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. This 
was stated to INTERFAX by Guliyev after a one and a half 
hour-long conversation with Kozyrev, most of which was face to 
face. 
  Asked by INTERFAX correspondent whether Azerbaijan's 
attitude 
to the Russian settlement plan changed after the meeting, 
Guliyev said: "I have always had a positive attitude to this 
plan. I have always supported Russia's peacekeeping efforts. 
Another problem is that the plan should take into account the 
methods of liberating the seized Azeri territories." According 
to Guliyev, Kozyrev agreed with his arguments. 
  Guliyev also said that he had not discussed with Kozyrev the 
timetable and all the technical aspects of the Russian plan. 
"These issues will be handled by the special envoy of the 
Russian president, special ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov and the 
Azeri Foreign Ministry," the speaker of the Azeri parliament 
said. 
  In turn, ambassador Kazimirov told INTERFAX that "the 
introduction of modifications to the Russian plan for the 
settlement of the conflict is continuing on a constant basis." 
"This is...a natural course (for such negotiations), so there is 
nothing extraordinary in Azerbaijan's position on this issue," 
the Russian diplomat said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- An Azerbaijani delegation, 
led by Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev, criticised a draft 
Russian peace plan for Karabakh during a meeting with Vladimir 
Lukin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for International 
Affairs. 
  The delegation's opinion is that this "starting document" 
infringes the national interests of Azerbaijan. If this plan is 
adopted as a basis, they argue, the republic would lose control 
over some more of its territories. 
  The Azerbaijani side expressed bewilderment over the 
suggested establishment of a number of checkpoints in now 
non-occupied lands and the zone of combat operations. Similar 
unacceptable proposals, they assert, are also envisaged for 
railway sections linking Azerbaijan with Armenia and located far 
away from the conflict zone. 
  The Azerbaijani parliamentarians are particularly concerned 
over issues related to the return of tens of thousands of 
Azerbaijani refugees to Nagorno-Karabakh, which did not find 
reflection in the new Russian initiatives. 
  While coming out in favour of an immediate cessation of fire 
and hostilities, they nevertheless believe that talks on a 
settlement of the conflict should be equal and fair. 
  Lukin's opinion is that the problem is that it is essential 
to cease fire to resolve the conflict but this does not at all 
mean that thereby someone demands the Azerbaijani side's 
recognition that the Russia-suggested plan is ideal and fair in 
every respect. There are no ideal documents in the world except 
the holy scriptures and the Koran, Lukin remarked. 
  The State Duma committee chairman is convinced that 
following 
a ceasefire it is necessary to sit down at the negotiating table 
to discuss all contenctions aspects to reflected in the Russian 
plan concerning in particular the delimitaiton of the 
conflicting forces and the forthcoming signing of an agreement 
on the cessation of hostilities. 
  As far as occupied Azerbaijani territories are concerned, 
they are to be vacated within 40 days in accordance with the 
suggested time-table, it was stated during the meeting. 
  Lukin said the Russian proposals are of benefit to the 
Azerbaijani side. These are not just Russian initiatives. They 
have been elaborated in conjunction with the conference on 
security and cooperation in Europe. It is difficult to resolve 
otherwise the problems that have piled up over the years, Lukin 
emphasised. 
  The development and deepening of economic departments 
between 
Russia and Azerbaijan depend in many respects on the cessation 
of military operations in the region, speakers said during the 
meeting. 
  On Tuesday the Azerbaijani MPs also met with representatives 
from various factions of deputies in Russia's State Duma. They 
are expected to meet with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev 
on Tuesday afternoon.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- A meeting took place 
today at the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 
building between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is in 
the capital on an official visit, and Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Speaking to Russian and foreign journalists after the 
meeting, Andrey Kozyrev stressed that the conversation between 
the high-ranking guest from Israel and Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin which took place earlier covered a great 
many topics and touched on all aspects of bilateral relations 
and of the problems of a Near East settlement. "We can state 
that our relations are improving," the minister said. "They are 
developing in a positive, specific way both with regard the 
former and the latter range of issues. Russia has serious and 
long-term interests in the Near East; they spring from 
full-scale cooperation and partnership with Israel and the Arab 
states, and from providing maximum assistance to the Near East 
peace process as a co-sponsor of it." 
  Summing up the results of the meetings already held, Yitzhaq 
Rabin noted that during the meetings he understood Russia's 
striving to continue assisting the establishment of peace and 
security in the Near East. Russia and the United States are 
helping the sides at the talks when it is requested of them, he 
pointed out. The Palestinians would like Moscow to help them in 
attaining certain aims, and we view this with understanding. 
  The Israeli head of government spoke of the desire to 
develop 
broad contacts with Russia, particularly because they have been 
frozen for the last four decades. "Therefore, cooperation needs 
to be started virtually from scratch and not only in the areas 
on which agreements were signed yesterday," he said. He said 
that he has invited Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and also 
the speakers of both houses of the Russian parliament to visit 
Israel because "the bilateral dialogue should take place at the 
highest level." 
  Yitzhaq Rabin said that he expressed profound gratitude to 
Boris Yeltsin for the fact that Russia granted its Jewish 
citizens the right to emigrate. "In all my meetings," he said, 
"I stressed that outbreaks of nationalism, neofascism, and 
neonazism can be seen in many countries. A careful watch must 
be kept on these processes." The prime minister also noted 
Russia's desire to assist in the release of Israeli 
prisoners-of-war seized at various times by the Arab side, and 
greeted with satisfaction Andrey Kozyrev's statement that Oleg 
Soskovets, a first deputy chairman of the Russian Government, 
who is visiting Syria, will raise this problem in talks with 
Syrian officials.

  [Text] At their meeting in the Russian State Duma Monday, 
Russian Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Rybkin and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin discussed the peace process in the Middle 
East. 
  The State Duma press office said Rybkin had informed the 
Israeli prime minister of Russia's sincere intention to achieve 
a political settlement in the Middle East. "Our country was 
among those who backed the creation of the independent Israeli 
state, and today we will be consistent in the development of 
cooperation," he was quoted as saying. 
  Rabin pointed out Russia's interest in and responsibility 
for 
the settlement as a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process. 
He hoped that the first part of P.L.O.-Israeli agreements 
concerning Palestinian self-rule would be accomplished within 
two or three weeks. "We want peace in the Middle East, and I 
think Russia's interests correspond to ours," Rabin pointed out. 
  The Israeli prime minister said he highly praised Russia's 
efforts intended for the settlement of the Middle East conflict. 
  The chairman of the State Duma committee for international 
affairs, Vladimir Lukin, said Rabin informed Rybkin of the 
creation of a Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
pointing out possible economic and financial difficulties. 
Rabin said he was concerned over the future of Israeli 
nationals staying within the autonomy. He added that the 
Israeli leadership would ensure the region's external defense, 
while its internal autonomy would be quite sufficient. 
  In the course of the meeting, the two sides expressed their 
dissatisfaction with the volume of Russian-Israeli trade, 
amounting to as little as $170 Mn at the moment, Lukin said. 
  The meeting also touched on expansion of bilateral ties in 
various fields taking into account that about 800,000 former 
Soviet and Russian citizens are residing in Israel. 
  During the meeting, Rybkin said he feared increasing 
nationalist and pro-Fascist tendencies in Russian society. In 
an answer to Rabin's questions, Rybkin referred to the fact that 
"such tendencies have always been in Russia" and that "one 
twentieth of society in any village or city preached exotic 
views of similar kind." At the same time, Rybkin said the State 
Duma was preparing hearings of the issue. 
  After the meeting, the Israeli prime minister told 
journalists that he had invited Rybkin to visit Jerusalem on 
behalf of the chairman of the Israeli parliament. For his part, 
Rybkin invited a delegation from the Israeli parliament to 
Moscow, Rabin said.

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- A meeting between President 
Boris Yeltsin and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has begun 
in the Kremlin. 
  In his opening remarks, Yeltsin said he was "glad to greet 
the prime minister on the first visit to Russia". He voiced 
satisfaction with the fact that the Israeli premier had come to 
Russia for a visit. 
  Yeltsin pointed out that there had been various periods in 
the history of bilateral relations: a deterioration of 
relations. At the same time the president said there had been 
also positive aspects, by relying on which "we can actively 
develop bilateral relations."

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin conferred in Moscow 
with President Yeltsin for one hour, and Israeli sources said it 
was a warm and good meeting. President Yeltsin and his foreign 
minister told Rabin that Russia's deputy prime minister is now 
visiting Damascus and will take up the issue of Israeli POW's 
and MIA's. He was also instructed to promote the negotiations 
between Israel and Syria. 
  President Yeltsin stressed to the prime minister that Russia 
will not provide Syria with new military equipment, only spare 
parts. Our correspondent Shlomo Raz adds that both men mentioned 
the danger of Islamic extremism. President Yeltsin said that 
this extremist movement is a danger to Russia and that his 
government is trying to build a belt to keep Islamic extremism 
away from the republics bordering on Iran. 
  Our correspondent notes that the Russians are pressing the 
Israeli delegation to sign a trade agreement. Israel has 
several reservations about clauses in the proposals, but the 
agreement might still be signed. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 26 April, in a 
similar report by Qobi Meydan, adds the following recorded 
remarks by Rabin following his meeting with Yeltsin: "I 
understood from the meeting with the president, the prime 
minister, and the foreign minister that Russia, unlike in the 
past, is interested in assuring progress in peace, security, and 
stability in the Middle East, and perhaps not only in the Middle 
East. From my viewpoint as an Israeli, however, that was the 
main issue I wanted to understand about the Russian position. 
Russia, together with the United States, will continue to act 
as cosponsor of the peace negotiations with our three 
neighboring Arab states and with the Palestinians."]

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- The press service of the president 
of the Russian Federation has issued the following statement: 
  "In the Kremlin today B.N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian 
Federation, received Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the State 
of Israel, who is paying an official visit to Russia. During 
the talks the sides discussed the situation in the Near East, 
the state of bilateral relations, and prospects for their 
development. 
  "During the discussion of the Near East peace process B.N. 
Yeltsin stressed that Russia will continue to play an active 
part in Near East affairs, in the interests of achieving 
practical results in the peace process as soon as possible and 
creating a zone of good-neighborliness and stability in the 
vicinity of its southern borders. 
  "Y. Rabin expressed gratitude for Moscow's energetic efforts 
to keep the Arab-Israeli talks moving forward and stressed 
Israel's interest in the development of broad cooperation with 
Russia in regional and international affairs. 
  "During the talks the two sides gave a positive assessment 
of 
Russian-Israeli relations. It was noted that the signing of a 
number of important intergovernmental documents during the 
current visit created a solid basis for their further 
development. Both sides expressed interest in effective use of 
the potential for cooperation in trade, economic, scientific, 
technical, cultural and other spheres."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Damascus April 26 TASS -- The first round of the 
Russian-Syrian talks was held between First Russian Vice-Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets, who arrived in Syria on Monday on an 
official visit, and Syrian Vice-Prime Minister of Economic 
Affairs Salim Yasin. 
  The ministers had a closed door meeting. But sources in the 
Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS that during the talks 
attention was focussed on questions concerning political, trade 
and economic cooperation between the two countries. According 
to the Russian side, the questions do not conform to the 
interests of the two states [as received]. Problems of military 
and technical cooperation were also touched upon during the 
negotiations. 
  Soskovets called on the Syrian side to "constructive 
cooperation", and also expressed readiness to "adopt specific 
decisions" during his three-day visit. In this context, he 
offered to form three working groups. The first one to deal 
with questions concerning mutual obligations, the second to 
resolve econimic problems, and the third to deal with problems 
of arms and special technologies. The first two groups from the 
Russian side will be led by Minister for Foreign Economic 
Relations Oleg Davydov, and the third by Chairman of the Russian 
Committee for Defence Industry Viktor Glukhikh and the Russian 
Defence Industry Committee Chairman Viktor Samoylov. 
  At the end of the talks Russian State Industry Committee 
Chairman Igor Suchkov told ITAR-TASS that the delicate question 
of Syria's debts was also touched upon during the talks. Till 
date it amounts to about 10 billion U.S. dollars. In this 
connection, he expressed assumption that if the Russian side 
"returns at least 20 per cent of the debts in the form of goods 
and simply in cash, then it will be equivalent to those expenses 
which we have borne." 
  The second round of the Russian-Syrian talks will be held on 
Tuesday.

<F P=106> [By diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy </F>
Trubetskoy, and others; from the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] Russia is interested in regular contacts with the 
West-European Union (WEU). The meeting between Russia's Foreign 
Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and the WEU Secretary General, Willem 
van Ekkelen, planned for Monday should be viewed in precisely 
this context, the director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
Department for European Cooperation, Yuriy Ushakov, told 
Interfax. 
  According to him, the WEU is beginning to play a more active 
role in European affairs. "We would like to synchronize the pace 
of our cooperation with the WEU with the development of our 
interaction with the European Union in the economic and 
political areas," the diplomat said. 
  Until recently the WEU did not play a noticeable role in 
European affairs, "because it was on the brink of death", he 
said. "The European Union reanimated that organization, when it 
took its decision on greater interaction with the WEU in 
Maastricht. So life itself has forced us to raise the level of 
relations with the WEU and develop them more extensively," 
Ushakov concluded.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The negotiations between the 
Russian and Panamanian foreign ministers, Andrey Kozyrev and 
Jose Raul Mulino, ended at the Russian Foreign Ministry on 
Monday with the signing of the declaration on the principles of 
mutual relations and cooperation between Russia and Panama. 
"The declaration is the first document laying down the 
foundation for our relations", Kozyrev said after the signing of 
the declaration. "We have agreed to transform the 
consulates-general into embassies so that Russia and Panama 
should have full-scale diplomatic relations". He said Russia 
closely follows developments in Panama. "We have a large 
interest in economic relations with that Latin American 
country," Kozyrev said. 
  Kozyrev noted that Russia welcomes Panama's role in the 
development of the peace process in Central America. On its 
part, Russia is vigorously participating in the Central American 
settlement the beginning to which was put by the negotiations on 
the Panamanian island Contadora back in 1983. 
  In his turn, the Panamanian foreign minister expressed 
confidence in the development of Panamanian-Russian contacts. 
  Jose Raul Mulino is in Russia on an official four-day visit, 
the first one since the two countries established diplomatic 
relations in March 1991.

  [Text] Russian-Chinese ties are evolving in quality from 
relations between neighbors to bilateral partnership. This was 
declared at Duma hearings on bilateral ties by Aleksandr Panov, 
a deputy Russian foreign minister. 
  In his words, the main stress in relations between the two 
countries is laid on their closer commercial ties. Last year's 
bilateral trade totalled 7.2 billion dollars, a 23 percent rise 
since 1992. That put Russia third among China's trade partners. 
  Panov argues that since Russia's barter trade is now 
obviously obsolete, priority should go to joint ventures and 
investment. 
  On the problem of border demarcation with China, Panov noted 
that the agreement signed between USSR and China on May 16, 
1991, took effect after its ratification by the former Supreme 
Soviet on February 13, 1992. He stressed that for the first 
time ever, a 4,300-kilometer-long eastern border between Russia 
and China had been determined with 3,700 kilometers of this 
stretch passing along the Amur, Ussuri, and Argun rivers. 
  He explained that the issue remained open on three islands 
-- 
the Bolshoy Ussuri and Tarabarov islands near Khabarovsk and the 
Bolshoy Island in the upper flows of the Argun river. 
Negotiations continue on the latter. 
  As for the western frontier with China (ie. west of 
Mongolia), stretching for 55 kilometers, the current talks with 
a joint delegation from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and 
Tajikistan have not revealed any differences, Panov declared.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Chinese `Commuters' Find It </F>
Difficult To Obtain Russian Visa"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- The volume of Russian-Chinese trade has 
started to fall off in recent months. In the opinion of Wang 
Zongzhang, vice governor of Heilongjiang Province, which borders 
Russia, restrictions on the entry of Chinese businessmen 
introduced at the end of February 1994 are the cause of this 
reduction in trade turnover. 
  Whereas previously Chinese citizens could, after paying a 
small sum to the state, acquire official so-called 
general-purpose passports and cross the Russian border without 
hindrance, a new agreement whereby they are required to have 
visas has now come into effect. 
  The former liberal system of registration afforded not just 
entrepreneurs but also small-time speculators and criminals the 
opportunity to get into Russia and stay there for an indefinite 
period. Now the invitations on which people come to our country 
from the PRC are carefully checked. 
  The falloff in trade is the other side of the coin. 
Russian-Chinese trade exchange has relied to a significant 
extent hitherto not on major firms but on "pedlars," who bring 
all their goods with them. As soon as the number of such 
traders declined, the volume of trade dropped. 
  A Russian expert, in private conversation with me, said that 
this might be not so bad. Too much of what was brought here was 
plain junk. In his opinion, the situation could change for the 
better thanks to the fact that Russia and China have agreed to 
certify goods according to standards accepted in Russia. 
  These duties will be assumed on the Chinese side by the 
Industrial Inspection Service for Import-Export Goods. Liu 
Baoyi, deputy general director of the inspection service, says 
that the arrangements whereby Chinese foodstuffs, electronics, 
and machines, items on which people's health and safety directly 
depend, receive an expert quality certificate will be introduced 
before this year is out. Quality control will gradually be 
applied to other goods.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Gypylov report: "Herds Being Rustled From Across </F>
the Border"] 
  [Text] Ulan-Ude -- A mixed commission on border issues is 
now working along the Russian-Mongolian state border which is 
more than 3,000 km in length. Immediately rumors started: 
There are disputed sectors. Even the press has divulged this. 
  "Mongolia and Russia recognize the inviolability of the 
existing borders," J. Choynhor, Mongolian deputy minister of 
foreign relations, was forced to state in the government 
newspaper ARDYN ERH. The present commission's cochairman, N. 
Pavlov, explained that "a planned verification is in progress 
which is stipulated under the treaty on friendly relations and 
cooperation between the two countries. Neither of us have any 
territorial claims toward each other." The inspection is not of 
a political nature. Nevertheless, there is disquiet. Especially 
in the area of Tuva. 
  The inhabitants of the border regions of Tuva and Mongolia 
have the same attitude toward the striped border posts as to a 
telegraph pole. They simply cross the border at any time and 
steal each other's cows, horses, and sheep. At times they they 
set fire to yurts, brawl, and when sorting out their differences 
go for their knives and rifles. Recently, Major General A. 
Kochetov, deputy commander of the Transbaykal Border District's 
forces, visited this area. He ordered the homeland's sentries 
to*strengthen their combat training. As soon as he had left, a 
herd of cows was rustled from beside the Shara-Suorata border 
post. But later Tuvinian shepherds crossed over, killed some 
Mongolians, and seized some horses. The guerrilla war in the 
Eastern Sayan Mountains continues.

  [Text] Colonel-General Grigoriy Bessmertniy, the chief of 
staff of the joint peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, told 
INTERFAX that the opposition was stepping up its activity on the 
Tajik-Afghan border. Military experts estimate that about 8,000 
militants have been concentrated along the Tajik-Afghan border, 
he said. 
  The situation is particularly tense in the Pyanj section, 
where militants attempt to cross the border and bring weapons to 
Tajikistan. 
  The opposition formations are equipped with automatic 
rifles, 
Stinger missiles, grenade launchers, recoilless rifles and 
self-made rocket launchers, and are much better trained than the 
Tajik forces. 
  Despite this, the Tajik opposition will not be able to break 
the defense line and penetrate into Tajikistan, said 
Bessmertniy. Tajikistan is strong enough to prevent civil war, 
he added. 
  Speaking about the role of the peacekeeping forces, he said 
that fighting against the Islamic opposition was not their goal. 
"Our goal is to prevent armed conflicts and help border guards," 
said Bessmertniy.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 25 April TASS -- Russian border troops 
guarding the Ishkashim section of the Tajik-Afghan border 
intercepted a group of five militants as they tried to cross the 
border into Afghanistan on Sunday. 
  According to military sources in Dushanbe, the militants 
opened fire on the border troops upon being uncovered. Two of 
them were killed during the resulting shoot-out, and the fate of 
the other three is still unknown. 
  Saturday evening, in the same area of the border, three 
armed 
men tried to enter the Gorno-Badakhshan region of Tajikistan 
from Afghanistan. Their crossing attempt was supported by fire 
from the Afghan side. The Russian border guards returned fire, 
taking out the enemy's positions and killing three of the 
fighters, while suffering no losses themselves. 
  According to reliable sources in Dushanbe, Tajik opposition 
forces have been concentrating in the Badakhshan area of 
Afghanistan in the past several days. Military sources say the 
aim of such a concentration is to break into the 
Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region of Tajikistan and unite there 
with the domestic opposition from the Pamir mountains and the 
central areas of Tajikistan neighboring on Pamir. The commander 
of the 29th infantry division of the Afghanistan Defence 
Ministry, Abdol Bashir Khaled, is supporting the Tajik 
opposition forces with transportation and military cover, 
according to the sources. 
  The Russian border troops are working together with Tajik 
Government forces to reinforce the threatened sector of the 
Tajik-Afghan border.

  [Text] Dushanbe 26 April TASS -- According to forecasts 
made by the military, in the near future the situation in the 
Pamir area of the Tajik-Afghan border will be tense. 
  At present, the re-stationing of armed militants, belonging 
to the movement of the Islamic Party of Tajikistan's Revival, 
continues in northern provinces of Afghanistan, and in 
particular, in the Badahshan Province where modernised military 
formations are arriving. 
  Military sources say that a large group of militants has 
concentrated in the Afghan settlement of Baharvk. The aim of 
the group is to destabilise the situation in the Pamir border 
area and cross into Tajikistan. Tajik anti-government militants 
are being assisted by high-ranking Afghan military officials. 
  The command of Russian border guard troops in Tajikistan 
jointly with Tajik government troops are taking additional 
measures to prevent armed provocations in border areas 
controlled by the Ishkashim and the Horog border guards units. 
Border guard posts have been reinforced in the most vulnerable 
border areas.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrei Petrovsky, Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The leader of the Tajik opposition Akbar Turajonzoda 
believes that the government of Tajikistan is unable to remain 
in power without Russian military or economic support for even 
three days. In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX he stressed 
that if Russia wished, the civil war in Tajikistan could be 
stopped in a month. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that the opposition 
might 
exert military pressure on Dushanbe to speed up the inter-Tajik 
talks. According to Turajonzoda, this was told to the Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshev. 
  He said Moscow on which the future of the country largely 
depends underestimates the opposition. "We do not want war or 
bloodshed, though we are quite strong even in Dushanbe," he said. 
  In the opinion of Turajonzoda to prevent the inter-Tajik 
dialogue from following the pattern of the Georgian-Abkhaz talks 
the Kulyab clan that controls all key posts in the cabinet 
should be invited to it. 
  He said Tajikistan should be a democratic secular state with 
the church separated from the state. According to Turajonzoda, 
the opposition does not intend to build an Islamic state because 
"we shall soon be entering the 21st century." He thinks Muslim 
traditions can be revived only with public will through 
referendums. "Even if we come to power through elections, we are 
not going to change fundamental constitutional norms, such as 
the freedom of the press and the functioning of parties," he 
said. 
  The chief of the information department of the Tajik Foreign 
Ministry Zafar Saidov told INTERFAX that Dushanbe is aware of 
"plans of hostile actions" made by the irreconcilable wing of 
the armed opposition in the border zone. "Their purpose is to 
destabilize the situation in the country by escalating armed 
confrontation on the frontier," he said. 
  Quoting reliable sources Saidov claimed that military 
advisors and instructors from several foreign countries have 
come to border areas of Afghanistan to help the Tajik armed 
opposition. 
  The Tajik Foreign Ministry is also aware of the 
concentration 
of armed groups of the Islamic Renaissance Party in the 
immediate vicinity of the border across the Pyandzh section. 
According to Saidov, the ministry has reliable information 
about Afghan military commanders helping Tajik opposition groups 
carry out their hostile plans.

Sidorin -- TASS] 
  [Text] Dushanbe, 26 Apr -- The European Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] will invest in a number of 
economic projects in Tajikistan, such as the exploration of 
major deposits of minerals, hydro power engineering, and 
creation of joint enterprises for the processing of agricultural 
produce. The KHOVAR correspondent learned abut it today from 
Gani Dzhamalov, head of the foreign economic relations 
department of the Tajik Council of Ministers. 
  This powerful international financial body has allocated 
200,000 U.S. dollars to carry out a professional assessment of 
the republican agro-industrial complex.

funds for the development of small and medium businesses in 
Tajikistan.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station observer Mulatov; from the special </F>
column "Comments on China" in the "Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" 
program] 
  [Text] Listeners and friends! Now we air the special 
column "Comments on China." Today we will first talk about 
China's interrelationships with the Central Asian nations of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS]. Our station observer 
Mulatov wrote a commentary on this issue: 
  After a one-and-a-half-year break, Chinese Prime Minister Li 
Peng is back on an overseas trip again. Foreign observers have 
pointed out that this time he is first visiting four CIS nations 
-- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan -- and 
then Mongolia. It can be said that China's relations with the 
Central Asian countries are going through their second spring, 
because these countries are located along the route of China's 
ancient Silk Road. 
  President of Uzbekistan Karimov said at a state banquet 
honoring the distinguished guest from China: China and 
Uzbekistan already were linked up by the Silk Road in ancient 
times; and, today we have all the necessary conditions for 
restoring this ancient channel. The Uzbek president saw a good 
opportunity for developing bilateral economic cooperation and 
trade, as there were many entrepreneurs accompaning Prime 
Minister Li Peng on his trip. We will continue to talk about 
China's relations with the CIS Central Asian nations in our 
station programs. 
  Russia understands and appreciates China's wish to develop 
equal, stable, and friendly relations with these countries on 
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Some 
Western media are now talking about so-called Sino-Russian 
competition in carving out spheres of influence in the Central 
Asian region. I think this is wishful thinking. During a press 
interview, Prime Minister Li Peng unequivocally pointed out: 
China supports Central Asian countries' good relations with 
Russia. Diplomats noted that the development of China's 
relations with the CIS Central Asian nations, and the 
strengthening of Sino-Russian relations and cooperation in the 
economic and other fields have progressed at the same pace. 
Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian federal government, will visit 
China next month. Therefore, Russo-Chinese relations also are 
developing continually.

  [Text] Tashkent, 25 Apr -- French President Francois 
Mitterrand arrived this evening in the capital of Uzbekistan on 
a three-day state visit. At Tashkent Airport, which was 
decorated with the flags of the two countries, he was greeted at 
the steps of the presidential Concord by Uzbekistan's President 
Islam Karimov. 
  The two heads of state had a private meeting at the country 
residence "Durmen," where the guest is staying. Later the Uzbek 
president hosted a banquet in Francois Mitterrand's honor. 
  Official talks with the participation of the delegations 
from 
both countries will continue tomorrow. It is expected that the 
agenda will include a wide range of topics on international 
politics and bilateral relations. It seems that the parties 
will also talk about the situation in the region, in particular 
about the situation in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as well as 
security problems and stability in the Central Asia, and 
relations between CIS countries. A large group of bankers and 
heads of major companies is accompanying the president. They 
are hoping to establish positive contacts with their Uzbek 
counterparts. 
  The tense situation in Bosnia has had an interesting effect 
on the protocol of the visit. Paris, apparently unwilling to 
leave unattended the Balkan side of its international policy, 
announced at the last minute that the composition of the 
delegation would be changed. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has 
been replaced by Minister of European Affairs Alain Lamassoure 
on the list of officials accompanying the president.

  [Text] Today, French President Francois Mitterrand will 
arrive in our country on a state visit until 27 April. This 
visit will further deepen equal and mutually advantageous 
cooperation between the two countries. Our program recorded an 
interview by our correspondent with Jean-Paul Vezian, 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of France to 
Uzbekistan. 
  [Vezian, in French fading to Russian report] The official 
visit of French President Francois Mitterrand to your country, 
says Jean-Paul Vezian, is considered in France to be very 
important because this is the first visit by a head of state of 
one of the EU countries. Today, we know Uzbekistan as a country 
with an ancient culture and at the same time a young and quickly 
developing country that values the preservation of peace and 
provisions for collective and calm work of all the peoples 
residing in Uzbekistan. We are expecting a lot of development 
in the social and political spheres, the creation of a 
democratic and open society, and the implementation of reforms 
allowing for the overcoming of the crisis situation in the 
economy inherited from the former USSR. 
  Answering a question on specific examples of French-Uzbek 
cooperation, Vezian pointed to cooperation in reviving the field 
of aviation in the country. Uzbekistan is one of the first 
countries in the region that has introduced airbuses constructed 
by Europeans for its aviation routes. These are being prepared 
in France and in Germany. There is a very interesting project 
for the joint reconstruction of Tashkent airport, which in its 
current condition cannot meet the increasing demands of Tashkent 
as a major center in Central Asia. The firm Thompson for 
example, is carrying out the introduction of radar equipment at 
Tashkent airport. 
  We are hoping to participate in the development of all 
spheres of industry, noted Vezian, which will allow Uzbekistan 
to achieve real economic independence. This is foremost in the 
fields of oil and cotton processing, and also the food industry. 
We already have interesting projects for irrigation, 
construction of textile and oil processing enterprises, the use 
of cotton for the production of paper, and also public services 
in various cities of the country. We hope for the successful use 
here of French firms' experience in the production of food 
products. In short, we are prepared to support all efforts for 
the speedy industrialization of the most important areas in the 
economy. 
  I think that initial successes will be strengthened by the 
introduction of the national currency, which will strengthen the 
mechanism for guaranteeing foreign investments. In the final 
instance it will be these factors that will create favorable 
conditions for the successful economic development of the 
country.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Yerkanyan: "The Reservist Call-Up Was </F>
Successful"] 
  [Text] Yet another three-month call-up of reserve officers 
and reserve personnel which has outraged the advocates of human 
rights and delighted the military has ended. There are clearly 
more men on the streets. Functionaries of law enforcement organs 
have clearly become more restrained. 
  Pacifists and militarists continue to argue about the 
justification of the use of coercive measures with regard to 
those evading service. At the same time, enemy designs are being 
manifested as plainly as the unhappiness of the world community 
with the militarization of the region. Therefore, which is more 
proper under the existing conditions--to enhance combat 
readiness in order to confirm for the enemy that the designs do 
not make sense, or refrain from unpopular measures that upset 
the world in order to demonstrate our lack of involvement in 
combat actions to the east of our borders? In answering this 
question, we should still take into account the fact that the 
Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict long ago entered the stage at which 
it could easily spread to the territory of interested states. 
  The latter circumstance is the main argument of the leaders 
of the defense department. 
  As far as the call-up itself is concerned, it was quite 
successful, as was to be expected. The activities held were 
evaluated as excellent by the organizational and mobilization 
directorate. Chief of the Directorate General Artur Arutyunyan 
stated that "everything went even better than could have been 
expected. The plan has been fulfilled 100 percent." Likewise 
according to him, "the martial spirit of the draftees is at the 
appropriate level" and "an overwhelming majority of them set out 
to serve with song and dance and in a wonderful mood."

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Georgian State Council </F>
Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani in Tbilisi--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Good morning. We are presenting a 
radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the 
Georgian parliament and head of state. Mr. Shevardnadze, I 
remember you said during last week's interview that no grave 
crime had been committed in the republic for the last 24 hours. 
On 20 April, a new terrorist act was committed in Tbilisi, when 
Major General Gia Gulua, head of the transport police and a 
deputy interior minister, was assassinated. 
  Do you think this killing could be politically motivated? At 
any rate, considering the result, we can say that the event has 
created the impression that the authorities are not sufficiently 
secure; it has also raised questions as to who will be next and 
why all this is being done. A feeling has been created both 
within the country and outside that terrorist acts are common in 
Georgia. Furthermore, the time has come when it is necessary to 
have the investigation brought to completion so that this case 
will not remain a common unsolved case of a terrorist act. 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. I already 
expressed some of my concerns regarding this case at a meeting 
of heads of law enforcement bodies and rayons of the republic 
which was shown on Georgian television; those who were 
interested were able to hear them then. This is an event that 
has given rise to grave concern. [passage omitted] 
  Of course, I have charged the law enforcement bodies to 
solve 
the case in the very near future and to ensure that incidents 
like this do not happen again. I have said that the bodies 
which must fight terrorism and which must aim to reach a 
situation where they are able to rule out terrorism as a 
phenomenon are still not up to the mark. 
  This cannot be justified by asserting that Georgia is not an 
exception and terrorist acts happen in other countries, too. 
This is true. They do happen in other countries, too. But 
this could prove disastrous for Georgia. If the world gets an 
established image of Georgia as a country where terrorism is a 
common occurrence, we will not be able to speak about the 
development of a large and serious economy or about the 
involvement of big and serious foreign business. 
  So this is a political issue, and that is why I regard 
terrorism as a phenomenon which should be combated with all 
possible means. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
Gia Gulua's assassination was connected with past deeds. 
[passage omitted] 
  Now, are the authorities and senior officials in general 
adequately protected? I would say that they must be provided 
with the essential minimum. Although I prohibit anything 
excessive -- I mean special means and special transport that 
require large expenses -- the minimum of what is needed to 
protect the authorities should be provided and it has not been 
sufficiently provided so far. In any normal country, the 
authorities should have guarantees of security. Thus, we have 
to draw serious conclusions from what has happened. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Oniani] During your meeting with law enforcement bodies 
you spoke about drug addiction. Last week your edict on urgent 
measures to enhance the struggle against drug addiction and drug 
trafficking was released. According to this edict, a national 
bureau to combat drug addiction and drug trafficking has been 
established on the basis of a former ministry department with a 
similar task. Is it possible that this edict will share the 
fate of your previous edict? We are very well aware that no one 
has quit his post because of drug addiction; there have been no 
cases like this. Do you think it possible to fight against the 
phenomenon when, for instance, Irakli Menagharishvili, our 
deputy prime minister, said during that meeting that the 
narcotics gangs had powerful patrons in the power structures 
[Security, Defense, and Interior Ministries and Procurator's 
Office]. The population knows everything and is very well aware 
of the ways drugs are brought into Georgia, who sells them, and 
what bars a supplier has to pass, or rather, whom and how much 
he has to pay to bring these drugs into Georgia. Yet another 
question, if you permit. Will the law relating to drug 
traffickers become stricter? This was also mentioned at your 
meeting with law enforcement bodies. 
  [Shevardnadze] Drug addiction, together with terrorism, must 
be considered as the most serious threat to our national 
statehood and, I would say, to the whole population -- all 
citizens and our future generations. The thing is that Georgia 
attracts drugs trafficking by its geographic situation, and will 
attract more in future. Regrettably, no guarantees have been 
created in the world to restrict the growth of drug trafficking 
into an international force. It is not late yet; drug addiction 
and drug trafficking have not reached syndicate proportions and 
they should never do so. [passage omitted] When drug 
trafficking reaches that stage, Georgia will not be able to 
afford a fight like this. It will hardly be possible to overcome 
the problem later. [passage indistinct] 
  Thus, paramount importance is attributed to an edict I 
signed 
recently and structures being established at the moment -- in 
particular, a government commission which will be chaired by 
Deputy Prime Minister Irakli Menagharishvili. Working groups 
have been established. The same sort of commissions and groups 
should be established in rayons and towns. [passage indistinct] 
A battle has started. This will be a long and complex battle 
and I agree with Deputy Prime Minister Menagharishvili that much 
will depend on how we succeed in destroying any kind of support 
for drug trafficking within the law enforcement bodies. Playing 
with drugs and especially patronizing drug trafficking must be 
declared a dreadful crime. 
  I am for making laws stricter. Of course, parliament will 
make the ultimate decision but, if needed, I can use my right of 
legislative initiative to speed up drafting laws and to set 
conditions for the parliament to create a legal basis for 
fighting drug addiction and drug trafficking. 
  [Oniani] Talks pertaining to the Abkhazian issue continued 
last week. How should the results of our activities be seen 
today in light of the Moscow meeting in May? Another question: 
It was said on television yesterday that we did not capture 
Gudauta because Shevardnadze thought that this would result in 
the genocide of Abkhazians and psychologically that was not the 
aim of the Georgian side. Could you comment on this, because it 
is not very explicit? 
  [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] A meeting in Moscow has 
been 
arranged for 10 May. Roughly the same parties as in Geneva will 
be involved there. The representation may be wider in certain 
issues. I would say that if the 10 May Moscow meeting fails to 
pass a decisive and serious resolution under the UN aegis, 
securing all conditions for a safe return of refugees that would 
be acceptable to us, we will be obliged rather than forced to 
appeal to the CIS. [passage indistinct] 
  There is a third version combining the two. According to 
this, there will be military forces in accordance with the CIS 
summit concept and UN observers. However, this combination 
would be more complicated, I suppose. We are rather short of 
time and I believe the UN representatives will seriously 
consider compressing the time so that the UN accomplishes its 
mission. If it does not, we will turn to the CIS and will have 
everything done within a CIS framework. 
  As for the question pertaining to last night's television 
program, I can say that the question was asked in such a way as 
to imply that Shevardnadze was concerned about danger and so on. 
My God, some people enjoy turning inside out 100,000 times what 
I have said 10,000 times. 
  I have explained why all this happened so many times. There 
were not even any plans to enter Gudauta, just as there were no 
plans to stop in Sukhumi. There were even no plans to enter 
Sukhumi. I did not issue an order to enter Sukhumi. This was 
an unauthorized action. And now it is being interpreted in a 
special way. I think that, having entered Sukhumi, the troops 
should not have stopped there. We spent [word indistinct] days 
in Sukhumi and no one knows how we spent these days. You all 
know that. 
  Later, after Sukhumi, our troops were in Leselidze, 
Gantiadi, 
and Gudauta and then the question of joining those troops by 
marching from Sukhumi through Gudauta was put forward, but it 
was too late. Strong defense lines and covering forces had been 
created there. A question was asked whether to enter Gudauta or 
not. Then I expressed my opinion, indicating that it would be 
wrong to enter Gudauta. There would be heavy casualties. Of 
course many thousands of Georgians would be killed but the 
Abkhazians who were there would be exterminated. I do not think 
anyone can see anything odd in the fact that the head of state 
demonstrated certain caution and care about people. We can call 
it genocide or simply elimination. This was the case. 
  But this probably was not the only thing. I am saying this 
for the first time. Marching into Gudauta meant a virtually 
direct clash between Russian and Georgian Armed Forces. This 
was the issue then. [passage omitted] Everyone must realize 
that it was not just like that that we could march into Gudauta, 
and because we did not do it, we lost everything. But 
apparently we have not lost absolutely everything because we did 
not go for Gudauta. You are all well aware what a direct clash 
with Russia Armed Forces would mean. Everyone knows why it was 
like this, what forces were accumulated at Gudauta Bombora 
airport and the adjacent territory, how much armament was 
concentrated there, and many other things. This is my answer: 
we could not act otherwise. 
  [Oniani] There is no logic in demanding that the government 
admit officially that Russia was fighting against us in Abkhazia 
on one hand and on claiming that we could capture Gudauta and 
did not do so on the other hand, because if Russia fought 
against us and Russian forces were involved in it, no one would 
give up Gudauta. 
  [Shevardnadze] This kind of talk has to be stopped, too. 
Some say that we have to declare that we were and we still are 
in a state of war with Russia. They did not realize then and 
fail to realize now what effect this would have. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, you visited the Tavtavi 
agricultural scientific and production organization yesterday 
and familiarized yourself with its activities. What are your 
impressions? 
  [Shevardnadze] I spoke yesterday at the meeting attended by 
scientists, practical workers, experts, and in the first 
instance the staff of Tavtavi and the management of the 
organization. [passage omitted] The less we talk about the 
country having been ruined and about the country being doomed 
and beyond salvation, and the more we think of the available 
resources and possibilities which remain unused and which do not 
require investing billions, the better. 
  Here is one concrete example. What can be done by 
cultivating soya? No country can survive without fats. We are 
importing fat just by grams. We sell 200 grams of margarine a 
month to the population and think that this is the height of 
delight. But life cannot go on like this. [passage omitted] 
Georgia seems to be created for the purpose of cultivating 
soya. I said yesterday that in 1905-1910 some 360,000 pounds of 
soya was exported from Kutaisi to Japan. We have forgotten all 
this. 
  I returned from my visit very encouraged. The people there 
care about production. We have certain foreign credits we can 
invest in this business. We can after all buy a factory. We 
can conclude a contract with farmers on good and favorable 
terms. A possibility will probably be found to pay them in 
kind, or in dollars so that they are able to safeguard their 
life. 
  The main thing is that we have to create an owner, a 
proprietor, I mean a proprietor in science, in industry, and a 
proprietor in breeding this culture. I am deeply convinced that 
if we take to this business using all our potential fully, I 
mean the scientific potential, an industrial potential and all 
our experience, the harvest will be miraculous. [passage omitted] 
  If we add the production of rape which provides huge 
long-term effects, and which also provides a large quantity of 
vegetable oil, we will be able to satisfy our own requirements. 
The development of cattle production will take a little longer 
and we have to search for ways to do this. 
  Although the meeting could have been held without me, I went 
there yesterday to say that we possess huge reserves. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Oniani] The parliamentary majority made a statement last 
week about the necessity for drastic economic reforms. During 
your speech at the meeting with the law enforcement bodies you 
said that the implementation of decisions made in the economic 
sphere is essential. Does this mean that a decision has already 
been made and really drastic economic reforms will be 
implemented in the very near future? 
  [Shevardnadze] I have long been aware that without drastic 
economic reforms the country will not be able to overcome the 
crisis and [words indistinct]. But in order to speak seriously 
about drastic reforms we needed basic preconditions -- I mean, 
we had to prevent the danger of a civil war and help the country 
to escape the state of war. Now, we have an opportunity to draw 
breath. It has also been necessary to establish basic order. 
One can hardly speak of drastic economic reforms without 
establishing basic order. At present, this precondition is also 
being created. [passage omitted] 
  For me, a decision on the implementation of drastic economic 
reforms already exists. The essence of the activities is to 
speed up the process and we are creating grounds to go ahead in 
this direction. Drastic measures are necessary for the creation 
of [word indistinct] of money. We have had talks on this 
subject and I think that by the end of April we will know what 
to do and what actions are to be taken to bring the economy into 
a relatively healthy state. 
  A drastic turn is necessary toward ownership. I dream of the 
time when every citizen is as proprietor. Every citizen must 
have a certain share in the wealth created over hundreds of 
years. This may be production or commercial spheres or any 
other. [passage omitted] 
  Drastic measures are also required to create the most 
favorable conditions for foreign investments. There is 
competition in this field, too. Investments stream down to 
countries where the most favorable conditions exist. Conditions 
for this can be created by geography, geopolitics, relative 
order, and so on, but unless there is a taxation system 
stimulating investors to come here, to settle down, and lay firm 
grounds for himself in order to help us and gain something for 
himself, no large-scale foreign investments will enter Georgia. 
  Also drastic measures must be taken in the fight against 
corruption. I have often spoken about this. Corruption will 
nip in the bud any kind of initiative. A proprietor's work will 
be made futile if this disease gets into the whole structures of 
the huge state institutions and lawenforcement bodies. [passage 
omitted] 
  In concluding our present conversation I would like to say 
that we shall be able to come out of the crisis only by drastic 
reforms, and the time is ripe for this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- The Federation Council welcomes 
the political will of the Russian Federation president, 
expressed in his message on strengthening the Russian state, to 
continue the policy of reforms and to unite constructive forces 
in society for creative work for the good of the country and its 
citizens. The upper chamber of parliament expressed this stance 
in the Federation Council's address to the Russian Federation 
president in response to his message. The chamber adopted the 
address at its sitting today. 
  Deputies have informed Boris Yeltsin that they have defined 
"measures which when implemented will promote steady interaction 
between branches of authority in the interests of democracy." 
  Deputies stressed that "they regard the treaty on achieving 
civic accord in Russia as an important step toward implementing 
the president's message," since it allows "obligations 
undertaken by all branches of authority, parties and public 
organizations to be placed under democratic surveillance." 
  The document addressed by the parliamentarians to the head 
of 
state stresses that they are counting on a responsible attitude 
on the part of the the president and government towards topical 
problems raised by the Federation Council. 
  Deputies note with regret that so far the chamber's appeals 
have not always met with a proper response from the executive 
authority.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The Federation Council has 
assigned its chairman Vladimir Shumeyko to sign the treaty on 
civic concord. The council discussed today the draft treaty, 
submitted by the president. 
  Deputies to the Federation Council agreed, in general, with 
the decision of the Federation Council Committee for 
Constitutional Legislation about the topicality of raising the 
problem of establishing civic concord. In the opinion of the 
committee, the treaty is a "political document, which will not 
be a substitute to the Constitution." The obligations of the 
upper chamber of parliament, recorded in the treaty, "do not go 
beyond its constitutional prerogatives." The committee decided 
that the Federation Council may take part in the signing of the 
document. Chairman of the Committee Isa Kostoyev called 
attention to the fact that "the concluding of the political 
agreement is the result of the initiative of the president's 
side, which means that it no longer claims the monopoly on state 
power."

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
turned down on Tuesday a proposal of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [of Russia -- LDPR] of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to include 
into its agenda the issue of dismissing Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and special envoy to former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin. 
  Alexey Mitrofanov from the LDPR proposed that the Duma 
discuss "recommendations to the Russian president" on dismissing 
the two politicians for "collapse of the Balkan policy of 
Russia", a clear reference to the latest Bosnian developments. 
  Zhirinovskiy, known for his open pro-Serb policy, has often 
stated that Kozyrev is the main government member whom he wants 
to be sacked.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The lower house of the 
Russian parliament held on Monday hearings on the state of and 
prospects for Russian-Chinese relations. The hearings were 
initiated by the International Committees of the Russian 
parliament's two chambers. 
  According to the deputy foreign minister, Aleksandr Panov, 
Russian-Chinese relations are a priority area of the Russian 
foreign policy. 
  The diplomat also noted in his speech that the Russian 
Foreign Ministry conducts a course for strengthening bilateral 
ties with China and sees its main task "in bringing 
Russian-Chinese relations to a level of constructive 
partnership". Panov noted that this line pursued by the Russian 
Foreign Office finds support from the Chinese side. 
  The deputy minister dwelt at length on problems in Russian- 
Chinese relations. He stressed that the situation in connection 
with the massive immigration of Chinese into Russia needs close 
attention. 
  It is aggravated by the fact that there is no law on the 
status of foreign citizens in Russia for the time being. In 
this connection the sides concluded an agreement which 
drastically cut the number of people having the right to a 
visa-free entry to Russia. 
  Apart from this, Panov continued, the problem of the border 
between the two countries remains acute. The diplomat 
underlined that the problem was "the main irritant in our 
relations until recently". 
  However, a joint Russian-Chinese demarcation commission is 
now actively working. It successfully resolves questions on 
ownership of disputed islands on border rivers. The diplomat 
also said that talks are in progress on cutting the strength of 
Russian and Chinese troops in border areas. 
  In the opinion of the deputy minister, it is necessary to 
develop infrastructure of the Russian-Chinese border in future, 
which will help promote trade and economic cooperation between 
the two countries. 
  Panov added that the turnover of border trade between Russia 
and China totalled 2.5 billion U.S. dollars last year. 
  He expressed opinion that it would be very profitable for 
Russia to lend a helping hand in modernisation of Chinese 
industrial enterprises built with Soviet assistance in the 1950s.

  [Text] A new version of the 1994 draft federal budget was 
submitted to the State Duma this evening. 
  As a result of amendments made by the Finance Ministry, the 
budget deficit has increased by nearly 6.5 trillion rubles, 
totalling 70 trillion rubles. It will be funded by credits from 
the Central Bank. 
  According to the document, the deficit grew because the 
expenditure part increased by 8 trillion rubles. This money has 
been earmarked for food purchases and investment in agriculture. 
The income part has also slightly increased because export and 
import duties have been raised. 
  Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the committee for 
budget- related issues, told a correspondent of Ekho Moskvy that 
a joint parliamentary and government commission will now start 
work on the document since there are still many criticisms 
targeted at the budget.

  [Text] During the 23 April parliamentary hearings in the 
Federation Council, Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation 
Council Budget Committee, heard the experts' opinion and 
proposed that the Finance Ministry's proposal on the complete 
abolition or considerable reduction of the number of tax 
privileges be supported. The hearings also made a decision to 
get the Federal Assembly to examine this draft in September to 
October 1994. It was proposed to enlist as experts Sergey 
Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee; 
Vladimir Gusev, head of the tax service; and Dmitriy Lvov, 
corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, among others. 
  Participants in the hearings recognized that Russia's tax 
system is imperfect. Tax service chief Sergey Almazov stated 
that tax evasion "has taken on a mass nature" and the number of 
court cases instituted does not reflect its real dimensions. 
Vladimir Gusev in turn intimated that the nonpayment of taxes 
into the budget had grown during the first quarter of 1994 by a 
factor of 1.7 over the corresponding period in 1993. The State 
Committee for Taxes is planning to discuss this problem at a 
sitting of its collegium in the second quarter. 
  Aleksandr Bukin, head of the Finance Ministry tax 
department, 
was more sanguine. He still expects that the revenue part of 
the budget will be completed as forecast.

  [Text] TV and radio agency Novyny learned from official 
sources that the negotiations in Sevastopol on the Black Sea 
Fleet division between Ukraine and Russia were frustrated 
through the fault of the Russian side. On 22 April at 1500 Kiev 
time, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was to hear and 
sign, together with his Ukrainian counterpart Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
the texts of relevant documents drafted by expert commissions. 
Without explaining his unexpected decision, Grachev left the 
session hall and departed from Crimea. You can hear more about 
further developments in Crimea in our subsequent news bulletins.

  [Text] Moscow 23 April TASS -- The position of the Black 
Sea Fleet commanders fully coincides with that of the Russian 
delegation to the talks on gradual settlement of the Black Sea 
Fleet dispute, First Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet 
Vitaliy Larionov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, Larionov said 
that number one problem is the location of the Black Sea Fleet 
and the Ukrainian Navy. He accused the Ukrainian side of shying 
away from this issue and concentrating instead on the division 
of the fleet. 
  Ukraine believes that both forces should stay in Sevastopol 
and rules out other variants. But the Black Sea Fleet includes, 
apart from ships, land infrastructure, aviation, coastal guards, 
engineering systems and other facilities. 
  The Russian delegation showed patience and willingness to 
find a common ground at the talks. But after Ukraine refused to 
discuss the location of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian 
Navy and sign a protocol of disagreements the Russian side had 
to suspend negotiations. 
  Larionov believes, however, that there is still a chance of 
resolving the dispute. He called on both sides to take a 
responsible approach and work out a constructive position.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev 25 April TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said on Monday that the documents on the Black Sea 
Fleet signed by Ukraine and Russia provide ample possibilities 
for settling the dispute. 
  Speaking to journalists in Kiev on Monday, Kravchuk said 
that 
the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers sought possible 
solutions at their meeting in Sevastopol, but the problem can be 
solved fully only by the presidents of the two countries. "I am 
against hasty assessments. I would not like the work of the two 
ministers to be viewed as a position of either side," he said. 
  "Our position is clear. We want Russia to agree to divide 
the fleet 50-50 as stipulated by the Yalta agreements. 
Proceeding from present-day realities, Ukraine should take 
15-20 per cent of ships. The rest 30-35 per cent will be either 
sold or used to compensate Russia for Ukrainian debts," he said. 
  Speaking about the location of the fleet, Kravchuk pointed 
out that "a Navy base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is being 
set up in Sevastopol in accordance with generally-recognised 
international norms. This is not new. This has been done 
before in other countries. Balaklava will be the home base of 
the Ukrainian Navy. We do not say that everything must be 
changed in one day. But the Russian side should take into 
account our position -- we cannot take only ships and leave 
officers. It must be settled in a civilised manner." 
  The president believes that the dispute can be solved by 
Russia and Ukraine without any outside interference or 
assistance. "The Black Sea Fleet is a local issue. It is not as 
global as the nuclear problem. We must solve it in a civilised 
manner, taking into account long-term interests of the two 
countries and counting on equal partnership. That's what should 
be used as the foundation for resolving the problem, not 
ambitions or wishes of some concrete people. The military think 
by military categories. We must think by national categories, 
the interests of the two great nations. We must not rush 
conclusions, statements and hints. We need to be patient," 
Kravchuk said. 
  He believes that the present tensions over the Black Sea 
Fleet were also caused by the actions of Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov. "When the defence ministers were meeting, Yuriy Meshkov 
made a statement that Ukrainian troops must leave the 
peninsular. Such statements border on ignorance. One cannot be 
serious demanding that Ukraine must leave the Crimea, its 
territory which has been officially and constitutionally 
recognised by the world and Russia. The 1990 agreement says that 
we have no territorial claims. This is also written down in the 
three-party agreement, under which Ukraine, the United States 
and Russia support sovereignty, inviolability of borders and 
independence." 
  During the meeting on 15 April President Boris Yeltsin and 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin confirmed their 
respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity and its sovereignty. 
This was said openly and straightforwardly, Kravchuk noted. 
  "Relations with the Crimea, which is part of Ukraine, should 
be normal and business-like. We want to help the Crimea and we 
do help it," he added. 
  Speaking about Ukraine's next move in settling the Black Sea 
Fleet dispute, Kravchuk said "we will get in touch with the 
president of Russia and agree our next meeting. I am convinced 
that we must solve this problem not to the detriment of Ukraine, 
the Crimea, Russia or the world community. We must solve it for 
the benefit of security, cooperation and friendly partnership 
relations."

the demise of Richard Nixon, the eminent United States 
politician and statesman." Thus run the condolences expressed 
by President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine. 
  "Richard Nixon," the Ukrainian president notes, "visited 
Ukraine several times. I recall with pleasure our meeting a 
month ago. Mr. Nixon had a deep understanding of the problems 
facing Ukraine on its path to restoration of statehood and he 
was sincere in striving to assist in solving them. The people 
of Ukraine are warmly grateful to him for his friendship and 
assistance." "I share the grief of the deceased's family and 
express my deepest sympathy for it," the Ukrainian president 
says in his condolences.

  [Text] Kiev, 22 Apr -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
has received Willem van Eekelen, secretary general of the 
Western European Union [WEU], who is on an official visit to 
Ukraine. 
  Ukraine comes out for the creation of an all-embracing 
security system in Europe and regards its participation in this 
system as one of the main external guarantees of its own 
national security, pointed out President Leonid Kravchuk. He 
told the guest that Ukraine regards cooperation with European 
structures as one of the priorities in its foreign policy. A 
proof of this is the fact that Ukraine was the first among the 
CIS countries to joint NATO's Partnership for Peace. 
Possibilities of admitting Ukraine to the consultative forum 
for cooperation of the WEU with the countries of central-eastern 
Europe and the Baltic states were discussed during the meeting. 
The Ukrainian president informed the secretary general about 
the political situation inside the state after the parliamentary 
election, which, in the opinion of the interlocutors, should not 
affect relations with foreign states.

  [Text] Kiev 23 April TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk and Secretary-General of the Western European Union 
[WEU] Willem van Eekelen who met here on Saturday, discussed 
collective security in Europe, stability in the region and 
development of contacts between the Western European Union and 
Ukraine. 
  Later in the day, Eekelen who visits Ukraine on an official 
mission at the invitation of the Ukrainian Peace Fund held a 
news conference where he stressed that he was satisfied with the 
results of his visit. 
  He noted that meetings with Kravchuk and other Ukrainian 
leaders as well as broad exchange of opinions gave him a chance 
to understand better problems facing Ukraine. 
  The secretary-general said that Europe now is not divided 
into two blocs. All nations should assume obligations to 
promote peace processes. "I believe that Ukraine, an influential 
European state, should play an important role in such issues." 
This is largely explained by its geopolitcal position in Europe. 
  Asked by UKRINFORM whether Ukraine can be at least an 
associated member of the European or Western European Unions, 
the guest replied that this process will be gradual. However, 
the process does not preclude broader cooperation between 
Ukraine and European structures. 
  This cooperation can develop even now in the form of a 
political dialogue and consultations, interparliamentary 
relations as well as in the framework of the Institute on 
Studies of Political Security which functions at European 
structures and which can establish fruitful relations with the 
International Relations Institute at the Kiev University. 
  The secretary-general stressed that the Ukrainian president 
displayed interest in these forms of cooperation. According to 
Eekelen, Kravchuk said that such contacts should be actively 
developed.

  [Text] Hanoi, 22 Apr -- The talks in the Vietnamese capital 
have confirmed that both sides wish to deepen bilateral 
cooperation. This was stated at a news conference today by 
Anatoliy Zlenko, who is here on an official visit. This is the 
first visit to Hanoi by a Ukrainian foreign minister since 
diplomatic relations were established between the two countries. 
  Vietnam occupies an important place in our foreign policy 
and 
foreign trade, A. Zlenko stressed at the news conference. 
Ukraine is aware of the benefits that relations with the SRV 
offer to both sides, and the talks in Hanoi have made it 
possible to clarify ways of deepening bilateral cooperation and 
mapping out new forms in which it can be conducted. There are 
good prospects for the development of economic cooperation 
between the two countries, including cooperation in oil 
refining, engineering, ferrous metallurgy, and sea transport, 
the Ukrainian foreign minister pointed out. 
  A. Zlenko held talks here with his Vietnamese colleague 
Nguyen Manh Cam. Today he was received by Vo Van Kiet, the SRV 
prime minister, and Le Duc Anh, the SRV president. The head of 
the Vietnamese Government confirmed his intention to pay an 
official visit to the Ukraine. A. Zlenko said this would open 
up a new page in relations between the two states. Agreements 
on encouragement and protection of investments and avoidance of 
double taxation are expected to be signed during the visit. 
These will be the basis of long-term cooperation between the 
two states. A. Zlenko told ITAR-TASS that the visit to Kiev by 
Vo Van Kiet -- the first by an SRV prime minister in the history 
of bilateral relations -- is scheduled for the first 10 days of 
June. 
  The great importance which both sides attach to the 
development of traditional cooperation on a new basis was noted 
during the meeting between the Ukrainian foreign minister and 
the Vietnamese president. A. Zlenko handed Le Duc Anh a 
personal message from Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk.

  [Text] Hanoi, 22 Apr -- We are eager to see accords on a 
Bosnian settlement, including those reached with the active 
involvement of Russian diplomacy, applied in practice. This was 
stated in an ITAR-TASS interview today by Ukrainian Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who is here on an official visit. We 
would like peace and tranquility to return to that region as 
quickly as possible, he said. If good will is shown and the 
warring parties and all interested states display a willingness 
to cooperate, a political solution to the Bosnian question can 
be found. A cease-fire is, unquestionably, the key to this. 
This must be followed by the continuation of peace talks 
involving international organizations, the Ukrainian foreign 
minister said. 
  We will do our best to facilitate a political settlement of 
the Bosnian problem at the United Nations, the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other international 
organizations, Zlenko stressed. Ukraine is also prepared to do 
its utmost to promote an international meeting on a Bosnian 
settlement. We believe that the Bosnian problem poses a threat 
not only to the peoples of the Balkans.

  [Text] Anatoliy Zlenko, Ukraine's minister of foreign 
affairs, who has been on official visits to Iran, India, and 
Vietnam, returned to Kiev on 24 April. Replying to journalists' 
questions, he said in particular that the development of 
relations with countries of the Asia-Pacific region fully 
corresponds to Ukraine's foreign policy concept. The realities 
of life in our state, he said, nudge us toward searching for new 
partners, who have already accumulated a great deal of 
experience in various fields. In the opinion of Anatoliy 
Zlenko, on the one hand this experience would be extremely 
useful in the implementation of reforms in Ukraine, and on the 
other hand it would be useful in the practical resolution of 
economic problems. We would like to see advantageous partners 
in the countries of the Asian region, who are currently also 
looking for a way in to new markets, the minister noted. 
  On the way to Kiev Anatoliy Zlenko stopped in Ashgabat, 
where 
he met the leaders of Turkmenistan's cabinet of ministers. The 
discussions centered on the development of bilateral relations, 
particularly in the economic field.

  Kannik told BNS after the meeting that Chernenko and the 
high-ranking officers who attended the meeting offered Estonia 
extensive cooperation in the defense sphere. Ukraine is 
prepared to advise Estonia in hi-tech manufacturing of military 
hardware and consider selling military technology and armaments 
to Estonia. Ukraine also proposed that Estonian servicemen 
might rest at Ukrainian resorts and vice versa. 
  Rein Helme, the chairman of the parliamentary defense 
commission who accompanies Kannik on his visit to Ukraine, told 
BNS that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry was interested in the 
output of the Estonian light and food industry, especially fish 
products and textiles. 
  The meeting discussed the possibilities for producing and 
procuring ammunition, but no concrete agreements were made. The 
parties decided to set up working groups to explore and resolve 
the issue. They also touched on the possibility of repairing 
Estonian armaments in Ukraine. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Russian leader Boris Yeltsin 
should recognise Dzhokhar Dudayev, the head of the self-styled 
Chechnya, as the official president of the Caucasian republic 
and begin negotiations with him, according to Vladimir Shumeyko, 
the speaker of the Federation Council who added that Chechnya 
should also display goodwill. 
  "Certain political goodwill should be displayed not only by 
the Russian side. President Dzhokhar Dudayev should recognise 
that the Chechen Republic is a subject of the Russian 
Federation", Shumeyko said in an interview with the "TRUD" 
newspaper on Tuesday. 
  "As soon as he does it negotiations should immediately 
begin", the speaker said. 
  Dudayev's election as president of Chechnya was annulled by 
the former Russian Supreme Soviet. The maverick president 
proclaimed independence from Russia, however, now Yeltsin had 
authorised to hold talks with the republic and appointed 
Nationalities Minister Sergey Shakhray to head the negotiations. 
  Shakhray believes Chechnya should follow suit of Tatarstan 
and sign a share-power deal with Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov 
has disagreed with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on 
matters of carrying out privatisation in Moscow. Luzhkov 
expressed his disgreement in an offficial message addressed to 
the Russian prime minister. 
  The document, which came to ITAR-TASS today, says that 
Luzhkov cannot put up with the fact that the Russian prime 
minister did not support proposals nade by the city 
administration about special ways of holding privatisation in 
Moscow. 
  In Luzhkov's opinion, "special conditions" suggest that the 
mayor's office can manage facilities of federal property located 
on the territory of the capital, reserve the right to control a 
package of shares of privatised enterprises and independently 
determine the size of the authorized stock of auctioned 
enterprises. Luzhkov believes that all this runs contrary to 
the law on privatisation, including in part that a considerable 
part of colossal property concentrated in the capital will not 
be exchnaged into privatisation vouchers. 
  Earlier, it was reported that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin 
familiarised himself with a draft law worked out by the Moscow 
city authorities in 1993 " on the introduction of a special 
order of privatisation in Moscow" and instructed the Russian 
government and the Russian Committee for State Property to 
jointly work out "compromise proposals." 
  However, officials of the Moscow government reported that 
the 
Moscow authorities had not yet sat down at the negotiating table 
with experts of the Russian Committee for State Property. 
  Recent developments show that a conflict between the Moscow 
mayor's office and the Committee for State Property over the 
pravatisation of the city property might turn into a conflict 
between the Moscow authorities and the federal government.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- A document on civic accord 
should be called a declaration and should be signed, believes 
President of Tatarstan Shaymiyev. He believes the title of a 
declaration would mean a milder political approach to the 
agreement being concluded. Shaymiyev, a deputy of the 
Federation Council, said this in an interview to ITAR-TASS 
during a break in the council's meeting where the draft treaty 
on civic accord is being discussed today. 
  The Tatarstan president believes the agreement refers above 
all to parties and movements, but for comprehensive accord it 
should be joined by all republics, territories, regions. 
Stability in the country for the implementation of the economic 
reform should be achieved within definite political frameworks, 
Shaymiyev said.

<F P=106> ["Our correspondent" report: "Without Money Life Is Bad--No </F>
Good at All"] 
  [Text] The Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan 19th session, which 
opened on Monday, has a very brief agenda. But it contains the 
extremely important question of the budget message of M. 
Shaymiyev, president of the republic. The mere fact that the 
Tatar Parliament is considering the question of the budget when 
there is as yet no Russian budget clearly illustrates the 
commencement of the Russian-Tatar treaty. After all, this was 
previously impossible in principle, and local members of 
parliament could only discuss figures already confirmed by 
Moscow. 
  No great joy on account of the new independence was 
discerned 
in the faces of the deputies, for that matter. A very gloomy 
picture is already taking shape from the three reports delivered 
on the first day of business of the session by the two deputy 
prime ministers and the minister of finance. All the negative 
trends of 1993 have only intensified in the first quarter of 
1994. The decline in production, enterprises' nonpayments, and 
the corresponding reduction in the tax base are making 
optimization of the budget a nearly insoluble problem. This was 
why the deputies had a sea of questions for Finance Minister D. 
Nagumanov and F. Khamidullin, chairman of the State Committee 
for the Economy, who presented the forecast of socioeconomic 
development for 1994. 
  The question-and-answer warmup did not satisfy the deputies, 
and they decided to devote the latter half of the first day of 
business to a detailed study in committee of the material that 
had been presented. 
  The morning of day two of the business of the session began 
with questions to Deputy prime Minister R. Muratov, who had the 
day before reported the results of foreign economic activity. 
There were things to ask about. Imported food has been sold here 
at prices higher than world prices, and it is hard to see in the 
documents how the money earned was returned to the treasury or 
if it was returned at all. There are many puzzles concerning the 
petrodollars. It is now several sessions running that the 
deputies have attempted to obtain detailed information on the 
use of the oil money--and all to no avail as yet. 
  But the question of the coming reform of the Cabinet of 
Ministers was the most interesting. R. Muratov had already let 
slip this measure at the recent annual meeting of the Trade and 
Industry Chamber, and this topic was now heard at the session. 
  Just one thing was said about the essence of the reform: 
"Marketeers" should join the government. About everything else, 
we can only guess. 
  The first conjecture is an unsubtle one--an increase in the 
machinery of administration. We heard at the session that 
expenditure on this in 1991-1993 had tripled, so the trend is 
clear. 
  Things are more complex with regard to the "marketeers." Who 
personally? And in which position? 
  President M. Shaymiyev is remaining silent also. The deputy 
prime minister is responding to all questions in a skillfully 
evasive manner. And the presentation to parliament of the most 
important budget question was for some reason or other entrusted 
not to the prime minister.... 
  The subject of reform of the government was heard in the 
debate also, but there was no further clarification. The main 
motifs in the deputies' speeches were, for all that, demands for 
money for various sectors, depending on their place of 
employment. V. Mustafin defended the interests of the defense 
industry, specifically the KAPO. M. Shaykhiyev put the main 
emphasis on agriculture. V. Ivanov, on housing construction. O. 
Vladimirov, on investments in power engineering. This could be 
continued ad infinitum. 
  The simple question of where the money for all this was to 
come from remained unclear. 
  Through the mouth of Deputy A. Shtanin the "Power of the 
People" group moved that the budget in the form in which it had 
been presented be rejected and modified, revenue from exports 
and off- budget funds having been included in it. Deputy I. 
Salakhov made even more drastic proposals. The main one was that 
the cabinet be required before mid-May to have drawn up an 
anticrisis program and that socioeconomic development be 
forecast and the budget approved only then. 
  Somehow on the quiet and imperceptibly in the interval 
between money battles the Supreme Soviet elected eight people's 
judges and terminated ahead of time the authority as deputies of 
I. Grachev, V. Mikhaylov, and G. Yegorov in connection with 
their election to the Russian Duma. Well, bon voyage! 
  The evening sitting was addressed by M. Sabirov, prime 
minister of Tatarstan.

<F P=106> ["Our correspondent" report: "Parliament Days"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday's business of the Supreme Soviet 19th 
session began with the perfectly composed approval of the 
account of administration of the budget for 1993. The acute 
critical charge of the speeches on the previous two days was not 
reflected in the results of the voting at all. 
  The bill on the budget system for 1994 was taken as read 
just 
as calmly. The Planning and Budget Commission embarked on its 
modification, and everyone else embarked on the "resort" act 
submitted by the trade unions. 
  The essence of the problem here is as follows. The passes 
that are sold by the unions at preferential prices or provided 
altogether without charge and paid for from the social insurance 
fund are regarded by the tax inspectorate, apparently, as 
citizens' supplementary income. Accordingly, income tax, 
according to currency legislation, has to be collected from this 
income. 
  An example: The full cost of a pass is R700,000; the 
preferential 10 percent cost, R70,000; the income of the 
vacationer (or patient), R630,000; income tax, R75,600. And even 
if the pass is free, the tax forces a person to pay the treasury 
R84,000. Yet the social insurance fund is formed from enterprise 
deductions, that is, from wages, essentially. 
  At first sight the matter is clear: People need to be 
exempted from this tax. But an attendant question arose at the 
session also: Should this privilege be accorded to all in 
succession or should its use be confined merely to needy 
citizens? The latter proposal of Deputy M. Khafizov was 
supported by President M. Shaymiyev also. As a result, the 
Legislation Commission received the assignment of urgent 
modification of the bill. Then Deputy K. Iskhakov presented a 
draft decree on the procedure of implementation of the Public 
Service Act. The act itself was adopted at the previous session, 
and VEDOMOSTI has already written about its content. It remains 
to add that the law will be introduced gradually and that 
government officials will start their free leave travel in 1995. 
  Serious problems arose over the law on off-budget funds. 
Things had gone well at the morning sitting, seemingly, and the 
first two articles were, albeit not without difficulty, adopted. 
In the break something [line missing] began to kill article 
after article. One clearly had the feeling that some people had 
done some active work with them. Who might this have been? 
  If it is considered that from the very start of business of 
the present Supreme Soviet the government has carefully been 
withdrawing the off-budget funds from the deputies' control, the 
first suspicion is clear. It is, in fact, the last one also 
inasmuch as no one other than the government has such a level of 
influence on the corps of deputies. Ultimately the bill was sent 
for modification. 
  After an early lunch, which came about on account of 
problems 
over modification of the budget act, the session adopted quite 
rapidly the "resort" act, after which came one further 
unscheduled break, and for the same reason. The intensive 
bargaining in the Planning and Budget Commission with the 
participation of the government produced no result. 
  Ultimately the deputies were offered a draft budget with 
expenditure approximately one-fourth in excess of revenue. How, 
we would like to know, is this difference to be covered? 
  In the February budget this question was solved simply--by 
money issue. But Tatarstan does not have its own printing press, 
and it will be necessary, consequently, to look for some other 
ways. 
  The budget was not adopted, and the deputies will, 
therefore, 
work tomorrow also.

Viktor Tkachenko, identified by caption; figures in brackets 
denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] 
  [Excerpts] [124158] [Tkachenko over aerial view of Mirnyy 
and missile transporters on a road] Many details pertaining to 
the history of the strategic missile forces have been kept 
secret. To this day, Arkhangelsk Oblast's Mirnyy city, which 
has a population of 40,000, does not feature on any maps. There 
is an explanation for this. Since 1957 missiles systems have 
been tested and satellites have been launched here at the 
Plesetsk test range. 
  Our country had to pay a high price for the acquisition of 
its nuclear missile shield during the Cold War years. Accidents 
occurred during delivery vehicle launches in 1973 and 1980. 
More than 50 people died. [video shows explosion and two 
soldiers dragging a third from scene of accident] [124232] 
  [124233 thru 124243 -- passage omitted -- unidentified 
officer over video of memorial to those who died says he helped 
organize funerals and speaks of the impact the accident left on 
him] 
  [1244244] [Tkachenko over video of missile museum] Events 
connected with the Cuba crisis in the sixties form a special 
page in Plesetsk's history. 
  [N. Moroz, identified by caption] When it became known that 
the Soviet Union had 12 missiles which could reach the United 
States, this had a very sobering influence on politicians. 
  [Tkachenko over video of computer center] Now the 
international climate has changed. Since January 1992 missile 
test experts have a new mission -- monitoring Russian and U.S. 
implementation of treaty obligations on the exchange of 
information about test launches undertaken by the former 
potential enemies. This equipment was installed at the secret 
Plesetsk computer center by Americans. And Russian specialists 
have installed similar equipment in the United States. Thus no 
strategic missile test launch in either Russia or across the 
ocean is a secret any longer. But equally it is no secret that 
both the Russian and the American missile experts are keeping 
their powder dry and already thinking about the missiles of the 
21st century. [video shows missile transporters on road, aerial

  [Text] Farmers in the Maritime Kray have started sowing 
their early grain crops half a month later than usual. The 
reason for the disruption to the agricultural timetable was the 
acute shortage of funds during the preparations for sowing, 
which caused numerous shortcomings in equipment repair, fuel, 
and mineral fertilizers. In March the Russian Government 
promised nearly 40 billion rubles in loans to assist peasants in 
the Maritime Kray with their sowing operations. However, up to 
now only a little more than half of this sum has been received. 
  Commercial banks to which the peasants have applied for 
advances are giving loans only on collateral. However, the 
majority of farmers have no possibility of accepting this; their 
workers have not received wages for several months. 
  As a result, only 4,000 hectares of early grain crops have 
been sown in the Maritime Kray so far, which is 15-fold less 
than for the same period last year.

  [Text] At the very height of field work, the sowing of 
early grain crops in Belgorod Oblast has been suspended. The 
reason for this is bad weather. 
  Sowing machines have stopped work in most rayons because of 
the rain which has affected practically the entire territory of

have already been sown to early grain crops. So as not to lose 
time and to complete sowing in the shortest time possible, 
machine operators have organized duty rosters in field camps. 
As soon as weather conditions permit they are ready to bring 
the full range of agricultural equipment into operation.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk believes that 
the holding of presidential elections on 26 June is "not 
completely legal." If a new parliament confirms its decision on 
holding elections and gives them legal force, then the president 
will determine his attitude to the elections, INTERFAX-UKRAINE 
was told Monday by the head of the presidential service 
responsible for internal policy, Nikolai Mikhalchenko. 
  On Saturday, the president said that he intended to request 
that the new parliament give its opinion on presidential and 
local elections. Kravchuk also said that he still believed that 
presidential elections in Ukraine on 26 June were premature. 
  Speaking about his attitude to the presidential elections, 
he 
said "I shall not agree to holding elections until they are 
backed by our Constitution and laws." 
  In January, President Kravchuk said that he did not intend 
to 
take part in the presidential elections on 26 June. In later 
statements he did not change his point of view. 
  Mikhalchenko said that the organizations which nominated 
Kravchuk as candidate for presidency may collect signatures 
without waiting for his final decision on standing for election. 
  According to Ukrainian electoral law, the nomination begins 
90 days before the elections and ends 60 days before. 
  A candidate may be nominated by a party at a congress or by 
an assembly of 500 voters. 
  The nominee may be registered if he collects 50,000 
signatures, including at least a thousand from each of 
two-thirds of the total number of constituencies.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 25 April TASS -- Crimean leader Yuriy Meshkov 
rejected on Monday accusations of separatism voiced by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk and accused Kiev of pushing the 
peninsula out of the country. 
  Speaking to ITAR-TASS by telephone, he turned down 
Kravchuk's 
allegations that the Crimea is looking for independence. On the 
contrary, Meshkov stated, it was Ukrainian Defence Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy who actually "expelled the Crimea from 
Ukraine" banning its president from participating in the 
Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea fleet held last week in 
Sevastopol. 
  Meshkov said that "on the eve of the presidential elections 
Kiev is merely staging a political show to please nationalists 
of all sorts". 
  According to the Crimean president, the Ukrainian leadership 
makes "a serious mistake" by ignoring the opinion of Crimea's 
people on the sharing of the fleet, whereas it would be the best 
option to attract the Crimea to the negotiations in the capacity 
of the third party.

<F P=106> [Interview with chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I. </F>
Plyushch by Serhiy Pravdenko, HOLOS UKRAYINY editor in chief, 
Eldar Seyidbekirov, and Svitlana Pysarenko for the newspapers 
HOLOS UKRAYINY and GOLOS KRYMA on 13 April 1994; place not 
given: "The People Are Looking Forward to Changes and Are 
Associating These Changes With New Democratic Forces"] 
  [Text] [Question] Ivan Stepanovych, is it possible, 
already today, to draw some conclusions on the elections. How 
do you see the new parliament? 
  [Plyushch] I am generally pleased with the elections to the 
new parliament, although I expected better results. Take, for 
example, Kiev. The capital has remained as though uninvolved. 
Only five out of 23 constituencies elected their deputies. 
Many of the constituencies were 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000 voters 
short each. This indicates that the elections were not properly 
organized and that the election campaign was not sufficiently 
well conducted. 
  I hope that Kievans do strive to create a law-governed state 
and that they will express this striving at repeat elections by 
taking part in the voting. 
  Regarding the political forces that came to the parliament, 
this question is not a simple one. One should not make hasty 
conclusions as though the "left-wing" or the "right-wing" forces 
have prevailed. Had our society been structured as "left" and 
"right" or in terms of parties, then some conclusions could be 
drawn. More that 100 deputies from the "left-wing" forces have 
come to the parliament -- representatives of the Communist 
Party, Socialists Party, and Peasant Party. However, when I 
went over their election platforms, I did not come across any 
indication there that they had come to the Supreme Council in 
order to fight it. They do not cast any aspersions on Ukraine's 
strategic course. It is only a matter of changing tactics. 
  However, one cannot say that the democratic forces suffered 
a 
defeat. Talking about the defeat of Rukh [Ukraine's People's 
Movement for Perestroyka], the Democratic Party, the Ukrainian 
Republican Party, or the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party 
-- it is true that the number of their deputies has dwindled. 
Well, there are about 100 "left-wingers" and more than 50 
"right-wingers." The total is about 150. How about the rest of 
the elected deputies? I think that they constitute a healthy 
center. In my opinion, this political force will constitute 
that backbone to which both "left-wingers" and "right-wingers" 
will cling. Perhaps, small "wings" of the "radical left" and of 
the "radical right" will remain. It is a normal phenomenon. 
  Nor do I see a tragedy in the fact that many well-known 
people's deputies failed to gain a victory at these elections. 
Objectively, people are looking forward to changes and are 
associating these changes, at the new stage, with new democratic 
forces. Those deputies who have not been elected at the recent 
elections have extensive experience and will be able to put it 
to use by getting mandates of deputies in local councils as well 
as in executive structures. 
  I was in favor of holding the elections during the fall of 
1993. The level at which the democratic forces were at that time 
was quite high and strong. We arrived at the elections at a 
different and a lower level, when the so-called democratic 
forces retreated from their positions somewhat. Unless 
elections to the local power structures are held in June, the 
situation will become further exacerbated. This is one of the 
factors -- a political one. Here is another factor, just 
appraise it. If one plans to contend at elections and wants to 
get a mandate, he will work with double energy. If the time for 
elections comes and one is not sure that he will be elected, he 
will primarily resolve his personal problems. 
  Third, people are already looking forward to elections. It 
is clear that those who want the process of development to be a 
guided one and who do not want chaos to prevail are looking 
forward to elections. The opinions became divided: Those who 
are sure of themselves are in favor of elections, and those who 
fear elections are against them. I believe that elections of 
representative and executive bodies from villages to oblasts 
will take place. Regarding presidential elections, it is not 
such a burning question as it is presented. If the Supreme 
Council approves the amendment to the Constitution and the prime 
minister becomes head of the executive power and forms that 
power, then is it really necessary to elect a president through 
nationwide elections, or perhaps the president who is now in 
office will continue fulfilling his functions? Meanwhile, the 
Law on Ukrainian Presidential Elections is still in effect.... 
  Unfortunately, the parliamentary elections proceeded against 
the background of strained relations with Russia. You know, 
after the first round of voting, I met with representatives of 
the Russian State Duma and I thought that political forces that 
realized that Ukraine was in earnest and forever were beginning 
to prevail and win in Russia. However, for some reason, 
recently, when gleams of political stability appeared in Ukraine 
and when changes for the better started taking shape in the 
economy, as we are already repaying our debt to Russia, despite 
everything, certain political forces in Russia have made 
themselves felt. Not only on the territory of the CIS, but also 
far away from it, they stir up passions and impose upon 
everybody their opinion that Ukraine cannot exist without Russia 
and that Russia cannot exist without Ukraine. The Crimean card 
is being played with increasing fervor. 
  [Question] How do you, Ivan Stepanovych assess the recent 
events in the Crimea? What is your opinion of the institution 
of presidency in the Crimea and the first steps taken by 
[Crimean President] Yu. Meshkov -- the transition to the Moscow 
time, the directive on the military service for the Crimeans on 
the Crimean territory, and the dismissal of the Security Service 
chief and the minister of internal affairs from their posts? 
  [Plyushch] You have formulated your question in a very 
narrow way. The Crimean problem did not start with electing 
Yuriy Meshkov as president of the Crimea. It is older than 
that. Of course, I do not claim to be the only owner of the 
truth. However, as a citizen and a political figure, I cannot 
remain silent. My conclusion is as follows: It is a 
well-planned and coordinated action on the part of certain 
political forces in Russia that have inherited the 
aforementioned qualities from the former Soviet Union. I think 
that it will not be long before we learn the truth about this. 
Only then will we assess objectively everything that is going 
on in the Crimea; this is just a fraction of the large-scale 
operation. Journalists will find a name for it. 
  I recommend that you read the interview with Lieutenant 
General Lebed in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He thoroughly imbibed 
everything that has been going on in the former Soviet Union 
during recent years and what is going on now. In my opinion, 
Lieutenant General Lebed, who was in charge of individual 
operations, wants the people to know the truth. A reporter 
asked him why he had started writing (this frontline general 
writes books), and he replied that he hoped that the people 
would stop and think of how to put life in order in such a 
colossally large country as Russia with its 150-million 
population. If this figure -- 150 million -- had not been 
mentioned, I would still have doubts as to what country he had 
in mind.... He was only talking about Russia. First, build 
life in your own country and then pacify, teach, and improve 
others. It is not Russia that must unilaterally resolve 
problems of the former Union. The CIS had to do this. However, 
nothing has been resolved over more than two years. The 
Dniester Region, according to him, is the problem for Moldovans 
and Russians and the Crimea -- for Russia and Ukraine. How 
about Baykonur? [President of Kazakhstan] Nursultan Nazarbayev 
is an intelligent person. An agreement for leasing Baykonur was 
concluded, and billions [monetary unit not specified] were hoped 
for. Where from? Where can a country that imports much of its 
foodstuffs get this much money? Well, the CIS had to tackle the 
problems of the Black Sea Fleet, the Crimea, the Dniester 
Region, Abkhazia, and so on. Just a few years ago, Gorbachev 
repeatedly said: "Don't you worry, this will also start in 
Ukraine." Some people now want this to start. Even in Russia's 
embassies much is done to shape the opinion in the United States 
and in developed Western countries to the effect that it is 
impossible to separate Ukraine from Russia. 
  On the television, they show, close-up, Chernomyrdin and 
Kebich signing the agreement on common currency. Nobody is 
saying how they understand it. The ECU in the European 
Community did not emerge right away, but only after 
corresponding conditions were created and only for interstate 
settlements, whereas the states have retained their national 
currencies. In the CIS, attempts are being made to draw the 
countries into the ruble zone. This is also one of the 
fundamental problems that the CIS must resolve. 
  The same applies to the Crimean issue. Who can determine 
today which of the peoples residing in the Crimea has more right 
to talk about itself as the people of the Crimea? The Crimean 
Tatar population is speaking about its autonomy. Undoubtedly, 
it has every reason for this. Today, hardly anybody would 
disagree with the fact that 50 years ago, a crime was committed 
against this people -- a whole people. It took almost half a 
century for this people to be rehabilitated; apologies were made 
to them, and they were offered to come and settle [in the 
Crimea]. However, it was Suslov's ideology. In adopting this 
decision, they did not think that it needed to be fulfilled. It 
was simply a political step, like yet another noisy campaign; to 
say one thing, to write something else, and to do something 
entirely different. 
  Furthermore, some people say that the Russian-speaking 
population residing in the Crimea is the troublemaker. In the 
course of the implementation of the specific Soviet national 
policy, the Crimea and Sevastopol were specially colonized by 
Russians. How can these people inhabiting the peninsula be 
accused of anything, these people who previously served for 15 
or 20 years in the cold seas? They knew that, after the 
service, they would live in warm Sevastopol under the gentle 
Crimean sun. Or take Tauria, the northern part of the Crimea, 
where Ukrainians constitute one-third of the population; did 
they ever think that they would see the times when somebody 
would try to determine whether or not they are indigenous, 
whether they have the right to live in the Crimea, and whether 
they side with Ukraine or with Russia? It never occurred to 
them. I know the moods of those people. 
  I am sure that the Crimean population understands all of 
this. Look, Moldova has changed its stand and held elections. 
There were 75 percent of voters, they elected the parliament, 
and embarked upon the road toward development. They don't even 
think about [uniting with] Romania. What should the Dniester 
Region do? Where to go? Russia does not accept it. Nor does 
Ukraine. We have an agreement with Moldova, and we cannot 
violate it. The same may happen to the Crimea -- as is 
happening in Abkhazia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. This 
must be realized by those high-ranking officials, who cannot 
properly handle their presentation weapons, which go off inside 
their pockets [an allusion to commander of the Black Sea Fleet 
Admiral E. Baltin]. 
  [Question] Ivan Stepanovych, in 1991, at an assembly of the 
Crimean Tatars -- Kurultay -- a Majlis was elected and granted 
the status of a supreme plenipotentiary representative body. At 
the recent elections to the Crimean Supreme Council, where the 
quota was 14 seats, the Majlis actually received all the 
mandates. Do you find it expedient to recognize the Majlis as a 
supreme representative body? 
  [Plyushch] I will, perhaps, disappoint you. I have deep 
respect for Dzhemilev and Chubarov, leaders of the Majlis. 
However, as an official, I am responsible for maintaining peace 
and calm in the state -- among the Crimean Tatars, among the 
Russians, and among the Ukrainians. If, as you are saying, the 
Majlis is recognized as a representative body of the Crimean 
Tatar population, this would not do any good either to the 
Crimean Tatars themselves, to the Russians, or to the 
Ukrainians. It would lead to hostility and confrontation. 
  A certain protocol must be followed in intrastate and 
interstate relations. I will quote an example. Before leaving 
for the celebration of the 72d anniversary of Turkey's Great 
National Assembly, I included Kurashyk, who was at that time 
chairman of the Crimean Council of Ministers, in the delegation. 
However, it was quite embarrassing for me when, among the state 
delegations that took part in the festivities, I also saw a 
Crimean delegation with Dzhemilev and Chubarov at the head. It 
was regarded as a state delegation. They should have officially 
made proposals on the composition of the Ukrainian delegation, 
taking into account Dzhemilev's and Chubarov's long-standing and 
close ties with Turkey. Then everything would have been entirely 
different. As it were, the situation might be regarded as a 
challenge to Ukraine. 
  Later, I had a conversation with the president of Turkey. I 
thanked him for his understanding of the problems of the Crimea 
and Crimean Tatars, who were settling in the Crimea, and for the 
intention to provide assistance to Ukraine for resolving urgent 
and vital issues of the Crimean Tatar population -- the building 
of housing, reclamation of land, arrival in the homeland, and so 
on. 
  I would like to thank the peninsula's Crimean Tatar 
population and the Majlis for the well-balanced policy it has 
been pursuing over recent years. Believe me, my attitude toward 
the Crimean Tatar autonomy is precisely the same as toward the 
Crimean Russian, or, for example, Crimean Ukrainian autonomies. 
Yuriy Meshkov gives preference to the Crimean Russian autonomy, 
Chubarov, and Dzhemilev to the Crimean Tatar one. I want an 
Autonomous Crimean Republic within Ukraine. 
  [Question] They say that Crimean autonomy has become a 
precursor for Ukraine's federalization. What is your attitude 
toward this and how do you assess the situation? 
  [Plyushch] The Crimea is one thing and Ukraine's 
federalization is something different altogether. Do not link 
the Crimea to federalization. Even though the law "On the 
Division of Powers Among the State Bodies of Ukraine and the 
Crimea" with changes and additions to it is the first stage in 
the development of future federal principles of organizational 
administration in Ukraine, the division of functions among the 
Cabinet of Ministers and central power structures, on the one 
hand, and regional bodies of executive power and 
self-government, on the other hand, may become the next step. 
How many years this is going to take will depend upon the 
course of reforms. How can there be any talk about a federal 
structure in the conditions when central organs govern 70 
percent of property. When people think in the following terms: 
If we speak Russian, our pension will double and if Ukrainian 
it will be in coupons [karbovantsi]. Who talks of a 
federalization here? 
  Our society needs to mature. This is my opinion: If we are 
in favor of a democratic and law-governed state, then we are in 
favor of a federal structure. If we advocate an administrative 
command system -- this means a unitary system. This is largely 
how things are.

<F P=106> [Declaration by the Fifth All-Ukrainian Assembly of the </F>
Ukrainian People's Rukh] 
  [Text] The two and a half years of Ukraine's national 
independence have demonstrated the impossibility of resolving 
the urgent issues of state construction without a decisive 
choice of the direction of the state's development. The absence 
of strategic definiteness and successiveness in the activities 
of the supreme bodies of power, primarily the Supreme Council 
and the president, have become the principal causes prompting 
the decision to terminate their powers and call early elections. 
  The elections of the first Ukrainian legislature held in 
accordance with the electoral law adopted by the last Supreme 
Council of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, a law of an 
explicitly antistate nature, hampered the creation of a 
politically determinate and structured Ukrainian legislature. 
  Under these circumstances, the issue of an expeditious 
choice 
of ways to form the bodies of state power and administration, 
and their structure is becoming of primary importance. In 
particular, this concerns executive power, as well as the 
status, functions, and powers of the head of the Ukrainian state. 
  Confirming its opposition to the current executive power and 
its leadership, and supporting the resolution by the Small 
Council on the expediency of postponing presidential elections 
until a later date when the above issues have been resolved, the 
Fifth All-Ukrainian Congress of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, in 
light of the current circumstances, believes it advisable to 
refrain from nominating a Rukh candidate for president. 
  The People's Rukh's Small Council has been requested to 
finalize the decision regarding Rukh participation in the 
presidential election campaign. 
  We are appealing to all democratic and national-patriotic 
forces to join their efforts to prevent Ukraine from embarking 
on the procommunist and proimperial path.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleksa Kurpas: "A Pig in a Poke From Meshkov"] </F>
  [Text] On the economic front in the confrontation between 
the Crimea and Ukraine, the latter has sustained a defeat. On 
11 April, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed three edicts 
under the numbers 37/94, 38/94, and 39/94.... These are the 
edicts "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," "On Banks 
and Banking Activity," and "On the Improvement of Taxation and 
the System of Settlements in the Economic Circulation." This 
has become a real shock for Ukraine's entrepreneurs. 
  For example, the first of the edicts allows the circulation 
on the Crimean territory of any foreign currency and, to spite 
Zvyahilskyy, it envisages the creation of the Crimean Interbank 
Currency Exchange. By the second edict, the peninsula has 
placed Ukraine's National Bank and our commercial banks in a 
quite desperate situation. At present, the Central Bank in the 
Crimea may carry out functions of a national bank (with the 
exception of issuing money). It may be expected that newly 
created Crimean banks will gather speed very fast, because low 
fixed capital will be assigned to them and they will be allowed 
to purchase and sell precious metals and stones, as well foreign 
securities. Incidentally, it is now possible to expect a 
difference in the rates of exchange of the Ukrainian karbovanets 
because in the Crimea, its rate of exchange will be determined 
through auctions at the Currency Exchange. 
  The third edict is a blow below the waist to Ukraine's 
Ministry of Finance. It envisages immediate replacement of the 
income tax by the tax (30 percent) on the profit and further 
improvement of the taxation system with canceling many types of 
Ukrainian taxes. 
  If these innovations are taken into account, it may be 
expected that the activity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs will be 
focused precisely on the Crimea. The Crimea is now becoming a 
kind of entrepreneurs' paradise through which money can be 
easily transferred abroad (incidentally, this mainly attracts 
shadow capital). Crimea itself will lose large sums of money, 
because the profit of enterprises will immediately become 
(artificially) minimal. 
  Yet, there also is a positive aspect: Such free 
convertibility of the karbovanets may be fabulously instrumental 
in raising its rate of exchange. However, an economic 
confrontation has added up to the political confrontation 
between the Crimea and Ukraine.

  [Text] There was a press conference today at the Crimean 
Council of Ministers. Acting Minister of State Affairs Viktor 
Minin answered questions. He is one of the Russian specialists 
that have come to the Crimean Government together with Yevgeniy 
Saburov. 
  The main directions of the government's activities are 
already outlined. These comprise urgent reforms of the economy. 
Ukraine, in spite of strained political relations with Crimea, 
does not hinder these reforms and is ready to help in certain 
aspects. In any case, the policy of an open economy in Crimea 
is being set up in accordance with Leonid Kravchuk's decree. 
  For the reforms to be successful it is necessary to have a 
bilateral Crimean-Ukrainian treaty and a bilateral 
Crimean-Russian treaty. Second, there must be a favorable 
political atmosphere. Unfortunately, the balance of political 
forces on the peninsula is such that the Crimea can be regarded 
as a hot spot. As Minin said, Crimea could become a center from 
which reforms start, but it could also become a center from 
which war starts. He confirmed his fears with the following 
figures: In 1992 there were 2,500 people from the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces on the peninsula. In 1994 there were 50,000 
people. Their deployment in the region of Sevastopol and other 
bays leaves one in no doubt of their aims. 
  Meanwhile, it is absolutely essential to Crimea that people 
not be afraid to come, because the summer resort season, 
according to Minin, is our main source of income. 
  There were also questions concerning the status of 
Sevastopol 
at the press conference. Minin said that every fourth 
inhabitant of that city is engaged in supporting the Black Sea 
Fleet. If the fleet is taken out of Sevastopol, this might mean 
a new deportation. Previous attempts to settle the Sevastopol 
problem have strained the situation even more.

<F P=106> [Article by political researcher Artur Belous: "With What </F>
Will the New Parliament Begin?"] 
  [Text] In my opinion, a party system of so-called 
"political pluralism" has been established in Ukraine. Such a 
system is characterized by the existence of a political center, 
with ultraright and ultraleft oppositions. A political center 
is usually formed by social-democratic, liberal, and 
conservative parties and movements; the leftist opposition by 
communists; and the right is represented by neofascists. The 
stability of this system, and thereby the integrity of the 
political basis of the state, is entirely dependent on the 
centrist parties which form the bodies of power. When the 
centrist parties weakened in Italy during the 1970's, ultraleft 
"red brigades" unleashed their terror. In contrast, the ruling 
right-centrist coalition in modern France set a reliable barrier 
to the ultraright National Front headed by the notorious Le Pen. 
  Preliminary results of the legislative elections in Ukraine 
show a relative weakness of the center. The Interregional Bloc 
of Reforms [MBR] (Kuchma-Hrynoyv bloc) can be called a centrist 
one. "Pure" MBR members will receive no more than 20 seats. We 
can expect that 30-40 "independent" deputies will join them. 
The second part of the center is represented by the party of 
power. Their number of seats varies from 60 to 70, with an 
additional 20-30 "independent" lawyers, economists, and 
entrepreneurs. Therefore, the center is amorphous and resembles 
"a bog" more than the basis of our state's legislature. 
  To the right of center there is the national-democratic 
bloc, 
of which Rukh is the leader, having 28 "pure" Rukh deputies and 
around 10 Rukh-sympathizers. Uniting with representatives of 
various parties, the national democrats will likely establish 
the so-called Supreme Council 2, with 60-70 deputies. 
  The ultraright Ukrainian National Assembly and Ukrainian 
National Self-Defense and Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative 
Republican Party won five seats, and will hardly pull any 
strings in the legislature. The ultraleft -- communists, who won 
86 seats -- are dangerous. Closer to the center are socialists 
(14 seats) and "agrarians" (18 seats). Slogans advocating the 
restoration of the USSR, which characterized election campaigns 
by communists in Donbass, question the "system" character -- 
respect for the fundamental basis, first and foremost, of our 
statehood -- of the revived Communist Party of Ukraine. 
  With what will the new legislature begin? With elections of 
its speaker, his deputies, and committee chairmen, because no 
force has a majority, "independent" Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch 
has a chance of becoming twofold champion in the legislative 
game. Communists will likely head up to two-thirds of the 
commissions and bear no responsibility for the formation of the 
government, which will likely remain unchanged, or change only 
slightly, pending the upcoming presidential elections. 
  The key issue is presidential elections. Leonid Makarovich 
has a weak lobby (a little over 10 presidential representatives 
have been elected deputies). In addition, some presidential 
agencies, having erroneously forecasted the nonelection of the 
required number of deputies -- which is sufficient for the 
normal work of the legislature -- have rendered clumsy 
assistance to the president, who was only once doubtful of the 
possibility of electing a legislature. Currently, simply out of 
a spirit of defiance, many deputies will not fail to remember 
all this. 
  However, external influences can work in favor of a possible 
subjective presidential wish to "postpone" elections. First, 
many potential candidates will wait for the beginning of the 
elections. A month and a half is not sufficient time to conduct 
a campaign (the legislature will begin its work on 10-15 May, 
while presidential elections are scheduled for 26 June). 
Secondly, the voting could be postponed until fall because the 
Rukh and other parties are not ready for the elections. This 
unreadiness will be masked by truly necessary constitutional 
changes to specify the powers of a newly elected head of the 
state. In addition, communists, who favor the liquidation of 
the post of president, will also play their part here. In 
addition, though Ivan Stepanovich favors the holding of timely 
elections, he cannot but consider the opinion of his supporters 
from the local soviets, who wish to shift the elections to 
prolong their existence and "resolve" issues of ownership. 
Leonid Kuchma, who ranks first in popularity polls, could always 
oppose the shifting of elections, but he will hardly have 
majority support among the new legislators. 
  Given the legislative and presidential elections, we have 
forgotten about the election campaign for local representative 
organs. The battle will hardly be any easier because control 
over property remains the key issue. I would like to hope that 
a new legislature will have enough willpower to change the past 
legislature's decision and limit direct elections for the heads 
of local administrations in towns, villages, and settlements, 
thereby leaving only the opportunity to nominate executive heads 
in rayons and oblasts. Otherwise, Ukraine will face the danger 
of irreversible decentralization. However, the leftist bloc 
(more than a third of all deputies) will hardly assist in 
preventing the soviets' next round of attacks. 
  Finally, Ukrainian membership in the CIS economic union can 
become a key issue in the new legislature. The MBR members 
(potential partners of the national democrats in domestic 
economic reforms) could unite with communists and socialists. 
It is easy to foresee that many lances will be broken over the 
CIS economic union, which has value on paper rather than in 
reality.

  [Text] The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Navy, Rear 
Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainyy, has described relocating the 
Ukrainian navy from Sevastopol as "unrealistic." 
  In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine Monday, he said "in 
this case it would be necessary to relocate about 4,000 families 
of officers and midshipmen of the Ukrainian Navy." "Under the 
current economic situation in Ukraine, this is practically 
impossible," Bezkorovainyy said. 
  A top-ranking Ukrainian Navy officer told INTERFAX-Ukraine 
that stationing the Ukrainian navy in Balaklava was impossible. 
The officer added that "in the bay of Balaklava there were only 
17 moorages, 15 of which were already occupied by border guards' 
boats." 
  Prior to this, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said the 
Ukrainian navy could be stationed in Balaklava. 
  The same source was quoted as saying that "vessels with a 
displacement of more than 1,000 tons presently built for 
Ukraine's fleet -- patrol boats and small anti-submarine vessels 
-- cannot enter the bay." 
  To ensure the fleet's normal functioning, it also needs to 
use the Streletskaya and Karantinnaya bays situated within 
Sevastopol's city line, a source in the Ukrainian navy 
headquarters said. 
  The same source supposed that the Ukrainian navy could 
jointly use 17 infrastructural installations of the Black Sea 
Fleet located in Sevastopol. "Only in this case the Ukrainian 
navy will be able to develop normally," the officer added.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 78 (568): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] On Friday afternoon President Boris Yeltsin met with 
leaders of the State Duma factions. The meeting focused on a 
draft agreement on civil accord. The new document which is in 
essence a reviewed variant of the draft was discussed the day 
earlier by the State Duma. The opinions of the leaders of the 
factions differed. Leaders of agrarians, communists, liberal 
democrats stated their negative attitude to the draft. These 
factions control more than one third of deputy mandates. The 
document was also criticized by representatives of the factions 
Yabloko, New Regional Policy and Russian Democratic Party. 
However, they noted that the final position on this issue will 
be determined by the factions later. 
  The draft agreement on civil accord was unconditionally 
supported by representatives of the factions Russia's Choice, 
the Russian Unity and Accord Party and Russia's Women. 
  Summarizing the results of hearings, speaker of the State 
Duma Ivan Rybkin stated that "he was absolutely not 
disappointed" with the discussion. Speaking to journalists he 
pointed out that deputies' speeches were "adequate to what is 
happening in the country." 
  Rybkin considers that it is far from certain that political 
parties at their conferences, plenums and congresses scheduled 
for this weekend would support positions of their parliamentary 
factions which spoke against signing the civil accord agreement. 
IF Note: According to the presidential plan, the original 
formula for signing the document on April 28 is as follows: the 
agreement should be signed by the president, chairmen of the 
parliament's chambers, prime minister, heads of the federation's 
subjects, and plenipotentiary representatives of political 
parties represented in the State Duma, the Public Chamber of the 
president, trade unions, "and after that the agreement should be 
opened for the signing by other sides." 
  In this connection, experts indicate a considerable 
probability that next Thursday the signing ceremony will be held 
without representatives of most major parties represented in the 
Duma. Some experts do not rule out that among participants in 
this solemn ceremony there will be no the speaker of the lower 
chamber. According to their forecasts, that may happen if 
deputies, in response to the LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
refuse to authorize the speaker with signing the agreement.

minutes and 15 seconds statutory Moscow time with the help of 
the "Cosmos 3M" light rocket carrier. ITAR-TASS has learned at 
the press center of the military forces that the launch, which 
was carried out for the Russian Defense Ministry, was successful.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev said that despite the failure of his talks with 
the Ukrainian defence minister on the Black Sea Fleet the 
dialogue must continue at a higher level. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Monday, Grachev 
said that it is pointless to begin a new round of talks unless 
top level officials agree to take part. He believes that the 
talks should involve the first vice-prime ministers or even the 
prime ministers of the two countries. 
  The minister believes that before that it is necessary to 
agree some navy terms in order to rule out any 
misinterpretations in the future. Ukraine has been considering 
the term "navy" as including only ships and other navy vessels. 
However, in reality the navy includes, apart from ships, navy 
aviation, marines, bases and logistics units. 
  "The navy is not only what floats but also what provides 
support on the ground. The division of ships and vessels of the 
Black Sea Fleet is only one tenth of the implementation of the 
decision on the division of the fleet on the whole, only its 
first stage," Grachev said. 
  He said that at the talks in Sevastopol Ukraine set forth 
unacceptable conditions, including joint location of the 
Ukrainian Navy and the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, which 
contradicts the agreement reached by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Ukraine suggested that Russian Black Sea Fleet ships should 
enter and leave their temporary bases through two-mile sea 
corridors and request permission three days in advance. 
Additionally, it proposed to regulate the navigation of Russian 
warships in Ukrainian territorial waters and the economic zone 
not by international acts, but Ukrainian laws.

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Azerbaijan wants to have 
"transparent" borders with Russia and is concerned over border 
posts which are now being constructed on the frontier between 
the two former Soviet republics. 
  The concern was voiced by Azerbaijani parliament speaker 
Rasul Guliyev who had a meeting with Russian State Duma speaker 
Ivan Rybkin on Tuesday. 
  Guliyev recalled that earlier it had been planned to create 
a 
free trade zone on the Russian-Azerbaijani border. 
  The speaker also called for a greater Russian role in ending 
the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. He said much in this respect 
depends on the Russian peace-keeping efforts. 
  "We greatly want that Russia says its important word in this 
respect", Guliyev stressed. 
  Political stabilisation in both countries can be promoted 
through better economic ties, according to him. "We count on the 
understanding of Russian partners" in this respect, he added.

  [Text] Russian border guards are preparing to repel a cross 
border attack in Tajikistan. Officials in the Russian border 
guard headquarters told INTERFAX that Tajik opposition fighters 
and Afghan Mojahedin were expected to attack the 12th post of 
the Moskovskiy unit towards the end of April. 
  The border guard chief of staff Lieutenant General Aleksandr 
Tymko did not rule out the possibility that other posts of the 
unit would be attacked. He thought that the objective of the 
provocations was to wreck the peace process. 
  He also emphasized that the Russian border guards were 
capable of repelling any attack on the Tajik-Afghan border.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Simonov: "It Is Good To Be a Guest of </F>
Turkmenbashi"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the foremost Russian publications 
who visited Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] for the weekend at the 
invitation of Turkmenia President Saparmurat Niyazov had 
occasion to be convinced of this personally. The new five-star 
hotel, a whole convoy of red Volvos for the guests, lavish 
feasts -- all this was to serve as graphic illustration of the 
fact that the "10 years of prosperity" economic program 
proclaimed by Turkmenbashi has begun to operate. 
  In their official, but sufficiently frank talk with 
President 
S. Niyazov, the Moscow journalists learned that: 

  -  Turkmenia could soon become Kuwait if it sells its energy 
carriers to states with the real ability to pay (at present the 
debts of Ukraine, Georgia, and several other CIS members for 
Turkmen gas and oil are $1.3 billion). The president pins great 
hopes on the construction of gas pipelines to the West -- to 
Iran, Turkey, and Europe -- and to the East -- to China and 
Japan; 
  -  The idea of a Eurasian Union voiced by Nursultan 
Nazarbayev to the recent Moscow summit is unfounded and that 
countries which recently had a taste of independence will 
scarcely agree to some "coordinating and guiding 
center;" 
  -  Turkmenbashi himself is not against criticism leveled 
at him but would prefer to meet it face to face in personal 
talks with his fellow fighters and not in the press. The 
president was disapproving about the Russian press, which allows 
itself keen attacks on Boris Yeltsin -- because in Niyazov's 
opinion these attacks contain more destructive than creative 
force; 
  -  The national assembly has already approved agreements 
whereby the 400,000 Russians living in Turkmenia will be able to 
acquire second -- Russian -- citizenship. That, incidentally, 
is so far the only instance of the solution of the problem of 
dual citizenship -- such difficult and delicate one for the 
entire CIS; 
  -  The Turkmen leader does not greatly like the 
abundance of portraits and sculptures of himself but believes 
this is a temporary enthusiasm -- until the completion of the 
economic reforms and the appearance of property owners who will 
become far more independent of all kinds of ideological 
epidemics. Nonetheless it is better to decorate the bank notes 
with a portrait of the first president in Turkmenia's history 
than to put pictures of animals on them.... 
  Apart from its familiarization aspect, the Moscow 
journalists' meeting with Saparmurat Niyazov had a diplomatic 
nature: The president did everything to emphasize his right to 
an independent view, differing greatly from others, of the 
strategy and tactics of reforms and insisted on the correct 
coverage of Turkmen problems from Moscow and the newspapermen of 
course promised to be objective and assured him that Russian 
newspapers will not harm the Turkmen people's political 
stability or moral health. 
  As a result of this dialogue the guests hoped that the 
Turkmen Government will find the opportunity to subscribe to 
Russian publications in the second half of 1994, earmarking 
funds for the conversion of the manat, with which subscribers 
now settle acocunts for Russian publications. It was with this 
hope that the guest left.

  [Text] Vladivostok April 26 TASS -- An armed attack was 
made on a naval unit of the Pacific Fleet here on the night from 
Monday to Tuesday. Attackers fired two shots killing an officer 
on duty, Major A. Tedeyev, and managed to flee. 
  According to the press centre of the Pacific Fleet, there 
were four attackers. The gunmen, most likely, penetrated the 
unit's location with a view to stealing weapons. As a result of 
the attack, they seized two Makarov pistols and cartridges for 
them. 
  This was already a second such attack in recent days. 
Literally a week ago, on April 20, unidentified gunmen attacked 
a small arms depot in a Vladivostok suburb. At that time the 
patrolmen and the sentry mamaged to beat off the attack without 
losses. 
  The military prosecutor's office has launched an 
investigation of facts related to the attack.

  [Text] The leaders of four of the nine Russian Duma 
factions are ready to sign the Civic Accord. They are Yegor 
Gaydar (Russia's Choice), Sergey Shakhray (Unity and Concord 
Party), Nikolay Travkin (Democratic Party), and Ekaterina 
Lakhova (Russia's Women). 
  The document will be signed in the St. George's Hall in the 
Kremlin on April 28. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (Yavlinskiy's faction) and Gennadiy 
Zyuganov (Communist Party) said they did not intend to sign the 
accord. 
  Yavlinskiy told journalists that he has no need to sign an 
agreement with Gaydar, but he does not want to sign such an 
accord with Zhirinovskiy. 
  The Communist Party at an all-Russian conference over the 
week- end declared that the signing of the document was not 
meaningful since "sources of confrontation" remain. 
  The Agrarian Party, led by Mikhail Lapshin, links its 
signing 
of the accord with the conclusion of an agreement between the 
cabinet and farmers on the guaranteed state purchase of crops. 
  The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], led by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, is to adopt a decision on Tuesday. Although 
Zhirinovskiy sets a number of terms (including the resignation 
of six cabinet ministers), he considers signing the accord 
possible "as a compromise, enabling further progress." 
  The New Regional Policy faction, led by Vladimir Medvedev, 
has so far been undecided since some members have been for and 
others have been against signing.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent tamara zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The memorandum on Civic 
Peace and Accord was fundamentally amended after Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin met with leaders from factions in the 
State Duma and with the heads of Russia's regions, presidential 
chief-of-staff Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
  He reported that the ban on proposing constitutional 
amendments which could destabilize the situation in society was 
removed. The text now states that the signatories agree to 
prepare constitutional amendments "on the basis of agreement." 
  In addition, the working group which prepared the memorandum 
removed the thesis about the obligation of bringing regional 
constitutions into line with the federal one, after taking into 
account the objections of local leaders. "That task will be 
resolved outside of the memorandum," Filatov said. Also in 
accordance with regional desires, the document calls for the 
proper implementation of the law on rehabilitating small 
nationalities which were persecuted during Stalinist rule. 
  The leaders of the agrarian and communist parties were 
likewise listened to; the memorandum now states that the 
signatories promise to work towards decreasing the income 
difference between the wealthy and poor. 
  ITAR-TASS asked Filatov if he thought the president did the 
right thing in canceling his decree depriving the former 
deputies which participated in the anti-Yeltsin events of 
October 3 and 4 of monetary compensation and housing, 
considering that leader of the front of national salvation Ilya 
Konstantinov is continuing to call for early presidential 
elections. In response, filatov explained that the cancellation 
of that decree did not mean those deputies who were 
"black-listed" would receive their housing for free. "Let them 
buy it at its market price," he said. 
  The chief-of-staff noted that Yeltsin did not count on the 
support of extremist organisations for the memorandum on accord 
and did not invite them to sign it. Concerning the refusal of 
the leader of the liberal "Yabloko" fraction, Grigory Yavlinsky, 
to participate in the agreement process, Filatov commented that 
"the voters are hardly likely to support him in that refusal."

  [Text] A copy of the now-amended draft of a civic accord 
for Russia has been made available to INTERFAX. 
  One crucial amendment allows for stabilizing changes to be 
made in Russia's basic law but as before, the signatories are 
banned from launching campaigns in favor of an early general 
election which is not envisaged in the constitution. 
  One other amendment binds the government to try to narrow 
the 
income gap this year. 
  Unlike the previous version shifting the burden of 
responsibility for CIS integration and Russia's breakthrough 
into the world market on the government alone, this is to be 
shared by the president and two houses of parliament as well. 
  At the same time, the Federal Assembly is bound to approve 
this year's budget come what may. 
  The clause binding the republics and regions to drop any 
claims for a change in their constitutional standing has been 
deleted and a new paragraph inserted in the chapter on ethnic 
relations which outlines mechanisms for implementing the law on 
the rehabilitation of deported peoples. 
  The section on ways of implementing the civic accord was 
largely amended including a new clause saying the president can 
hold regular meetings with signatories to discuss key issues 
relating to the enforcement of the accord. Apart from a 
monitoring function, the conciliatory commission is now vested 
with powers of permanent coordination. 
  Parts of the document dealing with its validity term and 
signing procedure have also been deleted.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 25 April broadcasts an 8-minute report 
within the "Details" program, during which Sergey Dorenko speaks 
to Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Yabloko faction, and 
briefly with Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, opponents 
of signing the Public Accord agreement. 
  Zyuganov lists his reasons for not signing the document, 
which include the fact that he believes the government has lost 
the trust of the people and that its social policies have 
failed. Although many parties and movements have signed 
agreements, there is no guarantee that these agreements will be 
implemented, he argues. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy tells Dorenko that some 7-8 million 
people voted for him during the elections. He says that his 
party believes in stability, but does not believe that signing 
this agreement will lead to stability. On the contrary, he 
stresses, it will exacerbate the situation in the long term, as 
it will separate reformers from anti-reformers. 
  Yavlinskiy says he believes that the agreement should be on 
more specific issues, such as privatization, social policy, or 
foreign policy. He expresses his displeasure with the fact 
that, among the signatories of the document are parties which 
could not be trusted, such as the Liberal Democratic Party, 
saying he does not believe their slogans and objectives or their 
policy, which is fraught with war. 
  Asked if he felt he would be isolated if he does not sign 
the 
document, Yavlinskiy responds that this would not be the case. 
His party cannot take part in matters which it does not believe 
in. 
  Dorenko sums up by saying that some people will be signing 
the document in order to stress their closeness to the 
president, and to help influence decision-making. Meanwhile, 
the non-signatories will continue the struggle out on the 
streets, Dorenko concludes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin: `Taxes Should </F>
Not Be Detrimental to the Citizens.' Government Approves Basic 
Spheres of Social Policy for 1994"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government has determined "the 
stabilization of the living standard of Russian Federation 
citizens, with its subsequent rise as the economy develops" as 
the target of its social policy for 1994. This target has been 
drawn up in a document adopted 21 April at a sitting of the 
Russian Federation Government Presidium -- Main Guidelines of 
the Russian Federation Government's Social Policy for 1994. 
  The document stresses that the "Russian Federation 
Government 
proceeds on the premise that a fruitful and considered social 
policy is a vital condition for continuing reforms, 
strengthening their social base, and improving the 
sociopolitical situation in the country." 
  The following main guidelines of social policy for 1994 are 
envisaged: the creation of economic and legal conditions to 
give an incentive to the active, able-bodied section of society 
to ensure its own prosperity through highly productive work; 
support for optimum correlations between the income of the 
active part of the population and disabled citizens; the 
provision of basic social guarantees; and the prevention of mass 
unemployment. 
  In order to put these aims into effect in 1994, the 
government intends to concentrate its efforts on preventing a 
reduction in the population's real monetary income, ensuring an 
equitable balance of economic interests and material 
possibilities of hired workers, entrepreneurs, and disabled 
citizens... 
  Summing up the discussion, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that 
the 
reform of taxation, to which he attaches prime significance, 
should be the key element in conducting policy in the social 
sphere. According to him, taxes "should not be detrimental to 
the citizens." 
  The government Presidium also examined the draft federal 
program for assisting with job placements for the population in 
1994, presented by the Federal Employment Service. 
  Presenting the draft program, Fedor Prokopov, chief of the 
Federal Employment Service, noted that its activity will mainly 
extend to able-bodied citizens who have work, but are at risk of 
losing it, as well as to those who are unemployed and are 
registered at the organs of the state employment service. 
  Potential "partial" unemployment during 1994 is put at 
between 5 million and 8 million people. Fedor Prokopov also 
predicts that the risk of citizens' losing their jobs will be 
increased -- the total number of workers who will be released 
from their jobs in 1994 will be 2.4-3.8 million. The work force 
supply on the labor market will also grow; the number of 
citizens who do not have work or have lost it, and are seeking 
work, will exceed 12 million people. 
  In the sphere of economic support for employment, the 
government intends to curb the cutback of economically expedient 
posts and those posts which are promising for the long term, and 
promote the growth of investment activity which creates new 
posts. 
  According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, job-placement measures for 
graduates of schools and higher educational establishments have 
been insufficiently thought through in the program, and 
investment programs in whose implementation the unemployed could 
be involved fully or partially have not been taken into 
consideration. A government commission headed by Vice Premier 
Yuriy Yarov has been created for further work on the federal 
program.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has 
said that "it is our duty do everything to rid the world of 
radiation calamities for ever." 
  In an address to the citizens of Russia in connection with 
the day of memory for those who have perished in radiation 
disasters, the president notes that recently the state has taken 
a number of steps to strengthen the social protection of people 
who have suffered from radiation. 
  "I believe that it is the duty of the state to pay 
particular 
attention to these people and to give them social support and 
protection. The problems of radioactive pollution should become 
a priority in the affairs of the federal structures and 
executive power bodies of the components of the Federation," he 
stresses.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- "Russia rightfully claims to 
host the 2002 Winter Olympics," said Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin at a ceremony of awarding Russian olympians in Moscow on 
Monday. 
  As is known, Russian southern resort of Sochi competes for 
the right to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
  "The successful performance of Russian national team at the 
(Lillehammer) Winter Olympics was a surprize for many foreign 
observers and athletes," he noted. 
  "The once powerful Soviet team had managed only once to win 
more medals than the present-day Russian team (in the Winter 
Olympics)," he remarked. 
  "The (1994) Winter Olympics have shown that Russia's 
athletes 
are in the vanguard of the world's top-level sport," President 
Yeltsin emphasized. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of State Duma, Russian parliament's lower house, were 
also present at the awarding ceremony.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report in the "Financial" column: "CIS </F>
Bankers Want To Build a New Payment Union. European Colleagues 
Think This Is Hardly Feasible"] 
  [Text] On 23 and 24 April in the Bor hotel in the Moscow 
region an international banking conference was held which 
discussed problems of Russia's financial settlements with 
neighboring states. The aim of the conference was, based on the 
commercial banks' practical experience, to elaborate a new 
settlements system on the post-Soviet subcontinent. The 
conference was held on the initiative of the Russian Banks 
Association, the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, the New 
Policy Center for Humanitarian Relations and Business 
Cooperation, and Mezhekonomsberbank. 
  By the admission of Vyacheslav Solovov, Russian Federation 
Central Bank deputy chairman, the actual disintegration of the 
ruble zone occurred on 1 July 1992 when Russia announced that 
all of its ruble accounts beyond its borders would not be 
recognized. This meant that Russia effectively introduced its 
own currency in non- cash circulation. The process was 
completed exactly a year later when Russia finally privatized 
the "Soviet" currency and stopped providing technical credits to 
the republics to finance commodity exchanges. Experiencing an 
acute ruble shortage, those republics that were unprepared for 
that had to launch their national currencies. Yet it would be 
unfair to blame Russia for the disintegration. The preservation 
of the old regime, with the administration test site 
[administrativnyy polygon] turning into a semblance of 
international economic space, would have made Russia a 
gratuitous donor. 
  After the bulk of interstate settlements moved from national 
to commercial banks, new settlement systems emerged 
spontaneously, adapted to the mixed post-Soviet economy. From 
primitive communal barter to attempts to create a foreign 
exchange market. According to the Russian Federation Central 
Bank, in 1993 the volume of financial settlements processed by 
Russia's commercial banks was triple those that went via the 
Central Bank. Commercial banks, operating with the CIS 
countries' "ersatz currencies," quote them at their own risk. 
There are practically no official quotations. The exchange 
rates of "ersatz currencies" published by the Central Bank are 
not recommended to commercial banks for conducting settlement 
operations. 
  According to Russian Banks Association President Sergey 
Yegorov, the new payment system should be built on the 
experience acquired by commercial banks. All scenarios proposed 
by the forum participants in essence boiled down to two 
variants: creating a Eurasian currency system, using the 
experience of Western Europe; or creating a new-type ruble zone, 
whose prototype could be the integration of the monetary systems 
of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus]. Both options were presented 
in a concept elaborated by Mezhekonomsberbank's expert council. 
The first variant envisions a lengthy preparatory period and a 
high extent of coordination at intergovernment level, which 
makes its execution rather problematic. The second presupposes a 
single emission center -- the Russian Central Bank, which will 
hardly be acceptable to the majority of CIS republics. 
  Meanwhile, according to expert appraisals by the Center for 
European Political Studies, the former USSR is not threatened 
either with the repetition of the West European experience or 
the creation of a new-type ruble zone. According to Western 
analysts, the CIS countries do not constitute an "optimal 
currency space." First of all, the former USSR republics lack 
two substantial elements: compatibility of economic structure 
and consensus on the need for a common economic policy. The 
greater part of trade links created in the past, analysts 
believe, will not hold for more than five years. Currently 
Russia's trade with its immediate neighbors constitutes 
one-third of its trade with the rest of the world.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- Creative and 
technological interaction in the unified information area of the 
CIS for objective and comprehensive coverage of events are 
discussed today by chiefs and technical directors of a number of 
news agencies of member-countries of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. They gathered in ITAR-TASS for a two-day 
conference that has become traditional. 
  Taking part in the meeting are delegations of state agencies 
of Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. 
  "The task of preserving and developing the unified 
information expanse is equally important for all republics of 
the former USSR in conditions of the establishment of their 
political and economic independence", Vitaliy Ignatenko, 
ITAR-TASS director-general, said inaugurating the conference. 
"The processes taking place in Russia are largely adequate to 
what happens in former union republics. We have common 
problems. One of them is preserving positions in the 
information market. It is no secret that a large number of 
foreign correspondents well-equipped technologically, works in 
CIS countries. They supply information to users in CIS 
countries". 
  Ignatenko invited representatives of news agencies of CIS 
countries to participate more actively in cooperation, 
specifically, in fuller joint use of the technical potential of 
ITAR-TASS. 
  Later the participants in the conference began debating 
prospects and potentials of expanding their ties and interaction 
in the unified information market. Participants in the 
conference are to meet chairman of the Council of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS Vladimir Shumeyko on 
Thursday.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 27 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA newspaper examines two versions of a treaty on public 
accord which members of the lower house now compare. One of 
them is planned to be signed in the Kremlin on Thursday. 
  "What has changed in the version (of the treaty -- eds.) Of 
April 26 as compared with the text of April 24 and the more so 
of April 20?" the newspaper asks. 
  "While the sides took obligations to refrain from demands to 
make amendments to the constitution in the version of April 20, 
which destabilise the situation in society, such explicitness 
disappeared in the document of April 24: the sides decided that 
amendments to the constitution can be made but only those which 
promote stabilisation. 
  "Explicitness again appeared in the draft of April 26 but 
this time with the sign plus: amendments stabilising the 
situation must be made. True, as in previous cases, nothing is 
said who will reject amendments. Nothing was changed in the 
thesis either that the sides take obligations not to initiate 
propaganda campaigns for early elections of federal bodies of 
power." 
  Continuing this theme, the NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA daily 
notes: "In our opinion, the signing of a treaty on social accord 
will be the most important event of this month. It is difficult 
to overestimate this event, irrespective of its results. 
  "Realisation (any) and failure are equally important. We 
believe that the treaty is not a scrap of paper and not a formal 
act in the train of many such events which will pass without 
notice. 
  "We regard this event in a broader context: in the context 
of 
actions which preceded the signing of the treaty and which will 
follow. 
  The treaty, at the same time, is a symbol, a seal which will 
authorise processes taking place now at the top echelons of 
power and a lever helping to speed up these processes without, 
although, completing them." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that it learnt from reliable 
sources that another reorganisation of the Russian cabinet's 
office is brewing at the white house. It will take place in the 
near future. 
  "According to new draft regulations, divisions of the 
government's office will be liquidated, and their functions will 
be assumed by newly-formed departments. Naturally, expected 
personnel reshuffling is the most burning question now. 
  "According to available information, the office head 
Vladimir 
Kvasov will be replaced by Valeriy Katukov who is now chief of 
the organisational division." 
  The ROSSIISKIYE VESTI newspaper comments on the 
Russian-Ukrainian talks in Sevastopol. "Apart from a diplomatic 
failure of the talks on the Black Sea Fleet between the Russian 
and Ukrainian defence ministers, the visit by General Pavel 
Grachev to Sevastopol brought him personal annoyance," the 
newspaper holds. 
  Following the failure of the talks, Ministers Grachev and 
Vitaliy Radetskyy exchanged recriminations in public: General 
Radetskyy was very caustic with respect to Grachev, speaking 
over Ukrainian television. 
  In turn, General Grachev, standing on the gangway of his 
"ministerial" plane before departure, expressed his opinion to 
Ukrainian officers, who were seeing him off, about the reception 
of the Russian delegation on Ukrainian soil. 
  The essence of Grachev's speech was that Ukraine is of 
course 
is a young state, but this does not justify how it receives 
foreign delegations (he meant the Russian military delegation). 
  The minister mentioned in passing that the Ukrainian side 
has 
no notion about diplomatic etiquette and that he would not be 
surprised if the russian delegation would have been arrested 
right at the airport instead of flying to moscow and he defence 
minister would have been handcuffed. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview 
with 
chairman of the state committee for the munitions industry 
Viktor Glukhikh who stresses: "We are extremely concerned over 
the situation with the state defence order for 1994. 
  "Its reduction by 80 per cent will cause, to put it mildly, 
very serious difficulties with the development and production of 
promising systems of weapons. It will deprive 150,000 people in 
the munitions industry of their jobs as well as over 100,000 
workers in the industry of ammunition and special chemistry." 
  The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with ex-premier of 
the former Soviet Union Nikolay Ryzhkov, which is entitled "I'm 
from the party whose name is Russia". 
  Ryzhkov writes: "To serve in the government now means to 
come 
under suspicion from honest people of complicity in corruption. 
The present executive power is very corrupt. Besides, it is 
against people, against the country. I don't see my place in 
it." 
  Under the headline "Master of Intelligence Partially Reveals 
Secrets", the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper started publishing 
reminiscences by Pavel Sudoplatov, one of the former heads of 
Soviet intelligence during Stalin's rule. 
  "The brilliant and tragic fate of this man," the newspaper 
notes, "reflects all vicissitudes of time at which he happened 
to live."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 28 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow 
newspapers concentrate on a response to the murder of Andrey 
Aizderdzis, member of the Russian parliament's lower chamber, 
and on the signing of a treaty on social accord which will take 
place in the Kremlin on Thursday. 
  No matter what were the reasons for the murder, the 
ROSSIISKIYE VESTI newspaper notes, "its very fact committed a 
day before the signing of a memorandum on civic accord and five 
days before mass May demonstrations, can provoke a political 
crisis". 
  Referring to the opinion of most Russian legislators, the 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper states that "it is chaos in the 
country and Interior Ministry organs cannot do anything with it. 
The underworld executes its sentences every day. Nothing can 
stop it even the legislator's mandate". 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDa newspaper reports the murder under 
the headline "Russian legislators have not been killed since 
1917". Quoting statements by "some militia officers", the 
newspaper concludes: "Aizderdzis was evidently killed, because 
the WHO IS WHO newspaper, which he patronised, printed the list 
of major criminals. It is out of question that he was killed for 
political reasons". 
  The TRUD newspaper devotes several materials to this event 
under the general headline "a shot at legislator also hit 
minister (eds: Interior Minister Viktor Yerin)". 
  The newspaper reminds that the lower chamber demanded that 
President Boris Yeltsin release the minister of his duties and 
"use to the full his constitutional powers to establish law and 
order immediately". TRUD quotes a statement by the Russian 
leader that assassins will be found. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper singles out information 
about this tragedy, noting that the assassination of the 
lawmaker infuriated the lower house so much that it "almost 
forbade its speaker (eds: Ivan Rybkin) to sign a treaty on civil 
accord". 
  At the same time, it expresses doubts that Aizderdzis was 
killed because of the above-mentioned publication in the WHO IS 
WHO newspaper. 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper runs an article devoted to 
Aizderdzis, noting: "Every of his speeches before audiences 
resembled vigorous attacks". The newspaper claims that 
Aizderdzis exposed families of those who gave orders to shoot at 
innocent people during the tragic October days. "He said 
everywhere that he was a participant in the parliament building 
defence, a communist." 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI examines another leading theme of the 
press 
-- the signing of a treaty on social accord -- from a position 
of "will the Russian nation obtain a creative perspective?". 
Under the above headline, the newspaper prints several 
materials devoted to this event. 
  "Russia is ready to obtain, at long last, a document of 
nation- wide importance, without a precedent in national 
history," says one of the articles. It is high time to 
understand that the Russian nation, all its parties, movements 
and segments of population, all its generations badly need 
peaceful continuity. 
  "Sure, recent antagonists cannot agree with each other in 
everything. But this is exactly the case when there cannot and 
should not be victors and vanquished." 
  The PRAVDA newspaper believes that the treaty will be signed 
by representatives of the so-called new bourgeoisie. "Nearly all 
left-wing parties" will be against. The newspaper claims that 
"there are grounds to believe that the signing of `the 
agreement' will eventually turn either into a farce or a 
tragedy." 
  TRUD publishes with some abbreviations a chapter from the 
book "The President's Journal" by Boris Yeltsin. It is named "a 
bleak streak". Describing the tragic events in moscow on 
October 3-4, 1993, the author notes that "that was struggle 
against the president, struggle for power... That was struggle 
for changing the state foundations". 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper features an interview with 
Viktor Samoilov, managing director of Rosvooruzhenie firm, a 
state company on export and import of arms and combat materiel. 
  He writes that the company does not intend to surrender its 
position in competition struggle. At the same time, it will be 
guided, in future too, by the following motto: "Cooperation in 
Trust". "We Are Open for Partnership".

  [Text] Minsk 25 April BELINFORM-TASS -- The Byelorussian 
(Belarusian) Government announced on Monday [25 April] a 
programme of state support for the producers of basic 
necessities in the Republic. 
  The move has been prompted by the worsening financial status 
of enterprises making consumer goods, especially in the light 
industry. 
  Rampant inflation, unstable money circulation, decline in 
the 
buying power of the population and insolvency of partners have 
caused a decrease in the production of key goods and negatively 
affected their competitiveness on the domestic market. 
Additionally, enterprises have been using their industrial 
potential and personnel resources by only 50 per cent. 
  The resolution adopted by the Byelorussian Government 
envisages a number of measures aimed at stabilising and 
increasing the production of basic goods, improving the 
situation in the domestic market and boosting exports of 
consumer goods. 
  The Government has requested the National Bank of 
Byelorussia 
to allocate 150 billion roubles to the light industry at a 
discount interest rate to buy wool, cotton and fur in 1994 and 
another 50 billion roubles to offset mutual debts with its 
partners.

  [Text] Mechyslaw Hryb and members of a governmental 
delegation -- Deputy Prime Minister Syarhey Linh and Ivan 
Tsyareshka, chairman of the Supreme Soviet permanent commission 
for international matters -- have held a news conference at the 
Supreme Soviet. The news conference was devoted to the results 
of the delegation's participation in the session of the European 
Parliament in Strasbourg. 
  The Belarusian delegation, Mechyslaw Hryb said, proposed to 
discuss issues concerning mutual relations with European 
countries and prospects for cooperation in various spheres of 
life. The talks followed this direction. 
  I have understood, Mechyslaw Hryb said, that we are moving 
toward the European Union, toward the European Parliament, very 
slowly. We should have been there long ago, because people in 
Europe have scarcely heard of us -- they believe that we are 
still living under totalitarianism without any changes. 
However, during our talks at the European Parliament, they were 
convinced that this is not the case any longer. 
  After leaving Strasbourg, our delegation arrived in 
Bucharest, where it participated in the Transmontana forum 
devoted to various political and economic issues facing European 
countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikalay Halko: "Henadz Karpenka Has an Answer to </F>
Any Question"] 
  [Text] On 19 April at the House of Publishing, People's 
Deputy Henadz Dzmitryyevich Karpenka, [leader of the Party of 
People's Accord] one of the candidates for the presidential 
office, held a news conference with journalists. 
  The first issue he considered necessary to emphasize was 
that 
he will not fight with his opponents by collecting compromising 
materials against them. Henadz Dzmitryyevich briefed on his 
meetings with company staffs in Brest and Kobryn. Even though 
high officials were trying to obstruct these meetings -- since, 
according to Karpenka, they had been requested to support [Prime 
Minister Vyacheslaw] Kebich, the talks were constructive. In 
general, Karpenka believes, the interests of the working class 
remain undefended. 
  Which problems does Karpenka consider most urgent? The first 
most painful problem is the lack of housing (the candidate has 
his own proposals in this regard); second -- stabilization of 
enterprises' work; third -- reasonable reorganization of the 
taxation system. 
  When the conversation touched upon the ruble zone and the 
agreement signed in Moscow, Henadz Dzmitryyevich quite sharply 
criticized eulogies published in the press in this regard, since 
such a campaign has only one goal -- to support Kebich. 
Karpenka said that the document should have been signed three 
years ago. At that time however, Vyacheslaw Frantsavich had a 
different opinion and wanted to create a "financial zoo" 
[relates to nicknames of the Belarusian currency] in Belarus. 
He has currently renounced this idea. It was not the first 
time Karpenka publicly stated that the Cabinet of Ministers is 
stuck in a political mire and neglects economic issues, which is 
the reason behind the current economic collapse. The Cabinet of 
Ministers has wasted three years on blabbing and now it is 
describing the signing of the Moscow agreement as an astonishing 
achievement. 
  Continuing to answer the questions concerning the ruble 
zone, 
Henadz Dzmitryyevich voiced concern over the fact that the 
methods of establishing the zone do not conform to Belarus' 
interests, but are dictated by Russia's powerful economic 
organizations. However, as Karpenka believes, in two or three 
months, everyone will see that we have received another "useless 
scrap of paper," as has already happened before. The people 
have heard many sweet promises of Kebich. Where are those 
promises now? 
  The presidential candidate provided examples of Minsk Oblast 
officials who have been neglecting agricultural problems, 
conducting a smear campaign against the Molodechno City Council 
chairman instead, which vividly describes the rotten 
administrative system and its immorality. 
  Karpenka also presented his opinion on the agricultural 
sector. Perhaps Vasil Staravoytaw, the well known chairman of 
the Rassvet kolkhoz, whom Karpenka highly respects, has 
something to do with that. His agrarian program envisions a 
unique approach and advocates support for large and medium-sized 
kolkhozes; small ones can be transformed into farms. 
  It is impossible to relate all topics addressed at the news 
conference. Karpenka provided comprehensive answers to all 
questions, including those concerning his family. His 
adversaries used to claim that he is the son-in-law of this or 
that secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central 
Committee. As a matter of fact, Karpenka's father-in-law has 
nothing to do with the KPB Central Committee. 
  Unfortunately, attempts to drag someone through the mire 
have 
not disappeared, but have become even more frequent. Karpenka 
won journalists' sympathy thanks to his openness, erudition, and 
ability to deeply analyze the state of affairs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Martinovich Morkovskiy, deputy </F>
chairman of the "state committee for the elimination of the 
consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe in Belarus," by 
Dietmar Ostermann: "Therefore, This Must Never Be Forgotten"] 
  [Text] [Ostermann] Eight years after the reactor accident 
at Chernobyl, many have done with the maximum credible accident 
or take it as a proof that the world also overcomes such 
catastrophes. Belarus was among those who suffered most from the 
consequences. Is all that already forgotten and over? 
  [Morkovskiy] Twenty-two percent of our territory is still 
radioactively contaminated. One-fifth of the Belarusian 
population lives there. An area of the size of your Saarland 
cannot be used; 130,000 people were resettled. We had to build 
new apartments, outpatients' departments, schools, and whole 
cities. The program is being continued. Belarus is spending 12 
percent of its state budget on the elimination of the 
consequences of Chernobyl. And that is after eight years! 
  I do not think that one can say that we have forgotten 
Chernobyl. 
  [Ostermann] Nevertheless, many affected persons are 
complaining about a lack of support; 45,000 Belarusians are 
still living in highly contaminated areas. 
  [Morkovskiy] Not all of them want to leave. In May 1986, 
one week after the catastrophe, I myself organized the first 
evacuations in the rural district of Narovlya. At that time, we 
were not properly briefed ourselves, and the people did not 
believe in the danger and wanted to stay. Then they nailed up 
their doors and windows with boards and said: We will come back 
in three weeks. 
  Out of the 320,000 inhabitants of the district, 12,000 still 
live there, although half of the district is still part of the 
"prohibited zone" with a radiation of more than 15 curie per 
square km and everyone has the right to free resettlement. This 
also applies to the city of Narovlya itself, where 12,000 people 
lived before. Out of the 7,000 inhabitants who stayed there, 
only 1,000 applied for resettlement. The others wanted to stay. 
  [Ostermann] Former helpers after the catastrophe and 
radiation victims are threatening a hunger strike, in order to 
draw attention to their disastrous situation, among them there 
are also Belarusians. Are all of them to blame themselves? 
  [Morkovskiy] I have not heard anything of that. Perhaps you 
are right that the situation is deteriorating. I also belong to 
the categories of liquidators. The diseases from which I am 
suffering need not come from radiation. They may also be due to 
the nervous strain that was so great in all those years. One 
looks at oneself and asks oneself: How come? In a poor country 
there are many problems, also without Chernobyl. 
  [Ostermann] Nor can you say that to a mother whose child has 
increased levels of radioactive iodine in its thyroid nor to a 
person suffering from cancer who has to wait for treatment for 
months. 
  [Morkovskiy] Many things were planned, but the money is 
lacking. In 1989, the Soviet Parliament adopted a program for 
the elimination of the consequences, but the Soviet Union does 
not exist any longer. Today, the means that are available to us 
suffice just for a quarter of the planned measures. If we were 
to implement everything, we would have to spend half of our 
state budget. This would ruin us. 
  [Ostermann] Does this mean that the other republics 
abandoned the program? 
  [Morkovskiy] Ukraine refrains from helping us in any way, 
although an agreement provided for it. Last year, Russia 
supported us with 8.5 billion rubles. We bought medicine and 
medical equipment with the money. 
  [Ostermann] Russia and Ukraine have again taken a fancy to 
nuclear power. Moscow is planning new nuclear reactors, Kiev 
does not switch off Chernobyl despite numerous incidents. What 
does Belarus think of it? 
  [Morkovskiy] If some have the advantages and some the 
damage, one comes to different opinions. Two-thirds of the 
areas that were contaminated in the Soviet Union at that time 
are in Belarus. Chernobyl is in Ukraine and supplies the 
Ukrainians with electricity. Our parliament called for the 
shutdown of the power plant in a resolution. From our point of 
view, this is probably justified. 
  [Ostermann] Kiev argues that it cannot afford to switch it 
off. 
  [Morkovskiy] Perhaps it is better to be a little afraid than 
to die of cold and hunger. This cannot be definitely said, 
there are pros and cons. In Belarus the situation is clear: We 
do not have nuclear power plants, but we have the consequences 
of the Chernobyl catastrophe. And nuclear power plants are 
everywhere at our borders -- in Smolensk, Chernobyl, near Rivne 
and Ignalina. 
  [Ostermann] Western experts remembered Chernobyl punctually 
on the anniversary of the catastrophe and they are warning 
against a new catastrophe. Are you alarmed? 
  [Morkovskiy] I think that there would not have been an 
explosion if rules had not been violated at that time. 
Irresponsibility and the violation of norms led to it. However, 
I am an agronomist, not a nuclear physicist. There should be 
projects that are completely safe. In this way, however, the 
danger to the people remains. Therefore, one must never forget 
what happened here.

  [Text] An IMF mission has arrived in Minsk to continue 
talks with the government on granting the second part of a 
credit to Belarus in the amount of $98 million. As is known, 
the first credit in the same amount was allotted by the IMF last 
summer due to the government's simultaneous signing of a 
memorandum on economic policy. The fulfillment of the 
memorandum's conditions by the government, which provide for 
radical market transformations with concrete terms of their 
implementation, is being taken by the IMF as a basis during 
talks on granting the second credit. 
  According to experts, the main difficulty in the talks will 
be an uncertain fate facing further Belarusian monetary and 
credit policies in connection with the declared monetary merger 
with the Russian Federation. IMF credits are intended to 
equalize the balance of payments in the country which gave [as 
heard] a loan.

  [Text] Belarussian [Belarusian] parliament speaker 
Mechyslaw Hryb predicts social tensions in connection with the 
current presidential campaign. He told a press conference on 
Tuesday that the Central Electoral Commission had officially 
registered the support groups of 19 candidates. Hryb also said 
that the current developments in Belarus must be closely 
followed. 
  Commenting on the agreement on the unification of the 
Belarussian and Russian monetary systems and on its compliance 
with the constitution, above all the provision on the powers of 
the National Bank of Belarus, Hryb said that interpretation of 
laws and state documents was the exclusive prerogative of the 
parliament. 
  He also announced that the problem of parliamentary 
elections 
would be considered during the spring parliamentary session. In 
experts' estimate, this means that the current parliament will 
perform its duties until the end of the constitution-provided 
term and that early parliamentary elections will not be held. 
  Among the main issues to be discussed during the emergency 
session opening on 27 April, is elections of the Constitutional 
Court and amendments in the customs legislation that are 
expected to cancel customs duties in Russian-Belarussian trade, 
given the forthcoming unification of the monetary systems.

  [Text] Minsk 26 April TASS -- Belarus does not have 
economic conditions for the introduction of a national currency 
and its security, Belarussian Vice-Premier and Minister of 
Economy Syarhey Linh told a news conference here today. 
  In his opinion, when introducing a national currency "one 
should avoid the mistakes of Commonwealth nations whose 
currencies collapsed within several weeks". This measure 
requires a hard currency reserve or a gold stock equal to 
$500-700 million, which Belarus does not have. 
  "That is why, we have so far decided on the Russian ruble. 
Time will show," said Linh. 
  Asked whether the treaty on unification of Russian and 
Belarussian monetary systems violates the Belarussian 
Constitution, Parliament Speaker Mechyslaw Hryb said the 
juridical service of the Belarussian Supreme Soviet has made the 
following conclusion on the basis of the republican 
constitution: "An article of the Belarussian fundamental law on 
the Belarussian National Bank says it shall have the right to 
monetary emission but there is no indication of the currency 
unit. It can be either Belarussian money or money of any other 
state."

Soviet deputies have declined the question of violations of the 
Constitution in connection with the signing of the monetary 
merger agreement with Russia. This motion was supported by only 
63 votes. 
  Since the former -- 13th -- Supreme Soviet session did not 
adopt a resolution on the activity of the temporary commission 
for combating corruption, which is headed by Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka, this issue was again included on the session agenda. 
However, this issue was declined by a majority vote. [passage

  [Text] Minsk 25 April TASS -- The agreement on the merger 
of monetary systems signed with Russia will help Byelorussia 
[Belarus] stabilise and improve the situation in the republic by 
the end of the year, Byelorussian Prime minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich said. 
  Speaking at a meeting with law enforcers in Minsk on Monday, 
Kebich said that the fist part of the agreement reducing customs 
tariffs will enter into force on May 1 and allow enterprises to 
sell their products and receive orders. 
  "Additionally, the prices of basic goods and communal 
services will be frozen in May. People's well-being will begin 
to grow due to increases in wages and salaries and 
implementation of targeted social programmes," he said. 
  Kebich believes that one of the factors that has allowed the 
Byelorussian economy to survive is that it has preserved "even 
relations with Russia. They have remained unchanged even in 
conditions when our local nationalist reformers celebrated their 
`victory' over `Muscovites' near Orsha or unwind in their absurd 
articles a new spiral of Russophobia." 
  Kebich also pointed to the "conscientious rejection of shock 
therapy" and "populism, adventurism and nationalism" as major 
factors that helped preserve stability in Byelorussia.

  [Text] President Mircea Snegur met on Wednesday morning 
President of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic Stepan Topal 
and chairman of the Gagauz parliament Mikhail Kendigelian. The 
meeting was held behind closed doors and journalists in Kishinev 
received official information of its results. 
  The spokesman for the Gagauz leader, Andrei Ibrishim, told 
Interfax that the two presidents discussed status of the regions 
densely populated by the Gagauz. He said that the bilateral 
commission was working successfully and the draft law may be 
worked out shortly and submitted to parliament within a month. 
  The spokesman refused to disclose the essence of the 
discussed document. He said, However, it coincides largely with 
the earlier bill on a special legal status of Gagauzia with 
account of proposals of the CSCE standing commission and US 
independent experts. 
  Another problem urgent for Snegur is the settlement of the 
situation in Transdniestria. Chairman of the parliament of the 
self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic, Grigory 
Marakutsa, said that another round of the 
Moldovan-Transdniestrian talks would be held shortly. Leaders of 
Kishinev and Tiraspol deputies of both parliaments and senior 
Russian officials are expected to take part. 
  According to Marakutsa, following recent elections in 
Moldova, the situation for Tiraspol changed for the better and 
hopefully, the two sides will agree to compromise. The 
Transdniestrian leader believes that Kishinev should agree to 
the creation of a confederative state to settle the situation. 
He said that Transdniestria will be part of such a state until 
Moldova is a sovereign state. However, the official Kishinev is 
flatly against the variant, said Marakutsa. Its rapprochement 
with Romania has suspended so far and no one will guarantee that 
this will never happen.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 27, BNS -- Aliens who were permanent 
residents of Estonia as of July 1, 1990, will be granted 
permanent residence permits, Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar 
said yesterday in Tallinn at a meeting with Russian journalists. 
  "Under the aliens law, those people are entitled to a 
permanent residence permit and nobody is going to deprive them 
of this right," Laar said. 
  Issuance of temporary three-year permits to that category of 
people stems from the need to observe international legal norms, 
Laar claimed. 
  "International legislation stipulates that a resident must 
have a temporary residence permit before he can be issued a 
permanent permit," the government head underscored. 
  Since this regulation "gives rise to concern" among aliens 
living in Estonia, the Cabinet plans to take some steps to 
alleviate it. 
  "To calm down the people, the government will allow those 
people to apply for the permanent residence permit immediately 
upon receipt of the temporary permit," Laar said. 
  The premier underlined that temporary residence permits 
grant 
aliens the same rights in privatization and the social sphere as 
Estonian citizens have. 
  "If somebody feels he is being discriminated against, he may 
fearlessly turn to the court," Laar said. 
  The Estonian premier emphasized in conversation with Russian 
reporters that Russia knows too little about developments in 
Estonia. 
  "Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev is lying when he 
says that Estonia is deporting Russians or that Estonia grants 
its citizenship on ethnic principles," Laar said. "Let Kozyrev 
come here and see for himself that he has more cause for anxiety 
about the situation of Russians in Central Asia." 
  The premier claimed the situation in Estonia is being 
aggravated by the some Russian citizens residing in that Baltic 
country. 
  "Being citizens of a foreign country resident in Estonia, 
they trumpet forth all over the world blatant lies, for example, 
about concentration camps for Russians being built here. 
  "Such people may become unwelcome in Estonia," the premier 
emphasized.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 26, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs returned Tuesday [26 April] from the Dusseldorf 
Dialogues forum, in which he delivered a report on the theme 
"From singing revolution to market economy and democracy." 
  The forum was attended by the leading entrepreneurs and 
politicians of the North Rhine-Westphalia Land, chiefly persons, 
linked with Latvia by present and future business interests. 
  The participants of the forum reached a series of principal 
agreements on technological cooperation to develop small and 
medium size businesses, Birkavs briefed reporters at the Riga 
airport. 
  The North-Rhine Westphalia's entrepreneurs already implement 
around 30 joint projects with Latvians. 
  Birkavs received formal support for the setup of a 
foundation 
to repatriate Russian retired servicemen and rehabilitate the 
environment of Skrunda, the site of the renowned Russian radar 
facility in Latvia. 
  However, "there is no real money yet" because Germany favors 
a temporizing policy regarding Latvian-Russian relations, 
Birkavs said. 
  Birkavs achieved the extension of German government 
sponsorship of the Latvians high school at Munster for one more 
year. Germany planned earlier to suspend the subsidies. 
  During this one year, Latvia will draft a project on how to 
convert the Munster school into its own education, culture and 
science center in Germany.

  [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa arrived in Vilnius 
Tuesday for a two-day official visit. 
  Following the welcoming ceremony at the airport, Walesa and 
his entourage went to the Antakalnis city cemetery where they 
paid tribute to the memory of those killed for the freedom and 
independence of Lithuania. Then the Polish president met 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  A treaty "On Friendly Relations and Neighborly Cooperation 
Between Lithuania and Poland" is expected to be signed on 
Tuesday. Its draft was prepared for several years. 
  The differences in views on the historic developments taking 
place 70 years ago were the main obstacle in preparing the 
treaty. The Lithuanian side wanted that the period from 1920 to 
1939, when Vilnius and its suburbs were part of Poland, be 
described in the treaty as "occupation". The Polish side 
disagreed with the wording. 
  The speaker of the Lithuanian Parliament told Interfax 
before 
the visit that the arrival of Walesa and the signing of the 
Lithuanian-Polish treaty should put an end to the past relations 
and become the basis for the development of good relations in 
the future. He said that the visit by the Polish leader would 
help an early integration of Lithuania into the European 
structures, the development of a mutually advantageous 
cooperation between the two states. 
  According to the Lithuanian statistics, in 1993 Lithuania 
exported to Poland goods to the sum of about $33.6 million which 
is 2.8 pct of total export. The country imported goods from 
Poland to the tune of about $9.1 dollars (about 0.7 pct of total 
imports).

  [Text] In Vilnius an hour ago the presidents of Poland and 
Lithuania, Lech Walesa and Algirdas Brazauskas, signed a treaty 
on cooperation and good-neighborly relations. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] This is a breakthrough in our 
bilateral relations because, out of seven our neighbors, 
Lithuania was the only one with which we did not have a 
bilateral treaty. The treaty was prepared not without 
difficulties, with accompanying protests from extreme 
nationalists on both sides. The Lithuanian side wanted to 
condemn in the treaty the occupation of Vilnius region in the 
period 1920-39 and regard as illegal all the effects of the 
presence of the Polish state in that region. 
  This was not acceptable to us, among other things because of 
the Poles living in Lithuania. Apart from that, it would be 
difficult to find a country which would condemn its own history 
in a treaty. Finally, both sides agreed that historical entries 
should be included in a separate declaration which would not 
have the force of an international agreement. 
  As a result, we are talking about the bad experiences of the 
past. Instead of a condemnation of the occupation there is a 
statement that Warsaw is the capital of Poland and Vilnius is 
the capital of Lithuania. This confirms Lithuania's historical 
rights to Vilnius. Neither Poland nor Lithuania have any 
territorial claims on each other. Both countries consider the 
present border as inviolable.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 26, BNS -- The Lithuanian-Polish 
agreement on friendly relations and good neighborly cooperation 
that was signed in Vilnius Tuesday [26 April] will have to be 
ratified by the legislations of the two nations and will come 
into effect when countries exchange ratification documents. 
  The treaty will be registered at the Secretariat of the 
United Nations in accordance with Article 102 of the U.N. 
Charter. 
  The accord will be effective for 15 years and will then be 
automatically extended every 5 years if not canceled by one of 
the sides. 
  The agreement says Lithuania and Poland regret the conflicts 
that occurred between them after World War I when Lithuanians 
and Poles started their new independent existence. The two 
nations condemn the use of force in their previous relations. 
  According to the treaty, both countries recognize each 
other's territorial integrity with their capitals Vilnius and 
Warsaw, irrespective of all border forming processes of the past. 
  Lithuania and Poland recognize the currently existing border 
between them and pledge to respect each other's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity. The two countries confirm that they have 
no territorial claims to each other and will not make any such 
claims in the future. 
  According to the agreement, the two nations will cooperate 
in 
order to preserve and enhance security in Europe, will seek to 
enhance security and trust in Europe and will pay special 
attention to security and trust in the Baltic Sea region. 
Lithuania and Poland intend to sign separate agreements on 
bilateral military relations. 
  The treaty says that in case one of the states is invaded by 
a third country, Lithuania and Poland will not help the invading 
country during the conflict. 
  The two countries intend to expand contacts between their 
state institutions and to create favorable conditions for 
parliamentary cooperation. According to the agreement, 
Lithuanian and Polish presidents and prime ministers will meet 
at least once a year. Foreign ministers will maintain regular 
contacts. 
  The accord provides for the creation of a joint commission 
to 
deal with border cooperation problems and to sign a respective 
agreement. Lithuania and Poland intend to increase the number 
of border crossings and to modernize the already existing ones. 
The two countries will seek to improve and to speed up customs 
and border procedures, as well as to develop cooperation between 
respective government agencies. 
  The two countries agree to base themselves on international 
principles and standards in defending the rights of national 
minorities. 
  According to the agreement, Lithuanian and Polish minorities 
in the two countries have the right to freely use their native 
languages in personal and social life; to use, distribute and 
exchange information in their native language and to have their 
own media sources; to use their language for studies; to create 
their own institutions, organizations or societies, especially 
cultural, religious and educational, as well as all types of 
schools. 
  National minorities would also be allowed to use their names 
and surnames the way they are pronounced in their native 
language. According to the agreement, spelling rules for 
surnames will be set by a separate agreement. 
  The two countries will preserve the national, cultural, 
linguistic and religious identity of national minorities on 
their territory. 
  The sides also pledge to determine the use of national 
minority languages in state institutions, especially in areas 
where a national minority makes up a greater part of the 
population.

  [Text] [Announcer] President Lech Walesa has said in 
Vilnius that the Polish-Lithuanian Treaty has put an end to the 
past. 
  [Correspondent Prygon] Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas had a similar view and expressed the hope that the 
treaty will prove to be sufficiently substantial to be 
beneficial to both our states and nations. Thus, the principle 
that in Polish-Lithuanian relations we should look into the 
future rather than the past has been reiterated. Poland and 
Lithuania are linked by similar interests in the economy and 
foreign policy. For this reason, and despite the fact that Lech 
Walesa is still skeptical about the Partnership for Peace 
program, he thinks that we should, I quote, turn this 
partnership into a great factor for security for Europe. He 
added that there is no free Poland without a free Lithuania. 
  Lech Walesa supports the idea put forward by Algirdas 
Brazauskas yesterday for a meeting between the heads of the 
Baltic states and the heads of the Visegrad Group. 
  Asked about the rebroadcasting of the Polish Television 
First 
Program to Lithuania, Lech Walesa said he will do everything he 
can to ensure that as many programs as possible reach Lithuania. 
He admitted, however, that there are technical difficulties. 
It is possible to overcome them, in the same way as we can 
overcome the situation at our border-crossing points. At the 
same time, he expressed the hope that by the year 2000 we will 
not be divided by a border.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 27, BNS -- "Too much concessions were 
made to Poland" in the Lithuanian-Polish friendship and 
cooperation agreement, says Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the 
rightist opposition in the Lithuanian parliament. 
  The accord was signed in Vilnius Tuesday [26 April] by 
Polish 
President Lech Walesa and Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas. 
  In an interview with the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper, 
Landsbergis noted, however, that the signing was an important 
step in relations between the two countries. The opposition 
leader said the shortcomings in the treaty were partly 
compensated by Brazauskas' speech in the parliament after the 
signing ceremony. "The president spoke about important things, 
which should be understood as unwritten contents of the treaty," 
Landsbergis said. 
  The Lithuanian opposition earlier sharply criticized the 
agreement and the Lithuanian Government for dropping a demand 
that the annexation of Vilnius and its region by Poland in 1920 
be mentioned in the treaty.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 26, BNS -- History should be left to 
historians, and more attention should be paid to regional 
cooperation and human rights, Polish President Lech Walesa said 
addressing the Lithuanian parliament Tuesday [26 April]. 
  Walesa and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas made 
speeches in the parliament after they signed an agreement on 
friendship and cooperation. 
  Walesa said Lithuania and Poland have a common history, 
which 
must be studied well in order to avoid mistakes in the future. 
  The Polish president said the two countries must not 
passively observe the changes in Europe and around the world, 
but should actively participate in the stabilization process 
that goes on in Eastern and Central Europe. 
  Walesa said relations within the Visegrad group (Slovakia, 
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic) and cooperation between 
the three Baltic states serve as examples for developing 
stronger regional cooperation. 
  He said Poland, as a Visegrad country and Lithuania's 
neighbor, seeks to develop cooperation in the entire region, 
including Germany, Russia and Scandinavian countries. 
  Walesa noted that membership in the European Union is a 
common goal of both Lithuania and Poland. He said "Poland is a 
natural ally of the Baltic states" on the road to a unified 
Europe. 
  "An expanded NATO bloc should be a guarantee of stability in 
this part of Europe," the Polish president said, and added that 
Poland and Lithuania are concerned about the extreme 
militarization of the Kaliningrad region. 
  Walesa called the signed Lithuanian-Polish accord an 
achievement of democracy, and noted that democracy means equal 
rights to all, including national minorities. He expressed hope 
that the Lithuanian parliament will manage to guarantee equal 
rights to Lithuania's Poles. In Walesa's words, Poland is 
pleased with the activities of its Lithuanian minority, 
especially the self- government and agricultural achievements in 
the predominantly Lithuanian-populated Punsk region. 
  In conclusion, Walesa said he is certain that an agreement 
between the Polish Eagle and the Lithuanian Vytis (the state 
emblems) will become "a foundation of a home for Poles and 
Lithuanians." 
  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, who spoke after 
Walesa, proposed to hold a summit of Visegrad and Baltic leaders. 
  Brazauskas said Poland and Lithuania, which are the biggest 
Visegrad and Baltic states, could stimulate a dialog between the 
two regions on all levels. A free trade agreement between the 
Baltics and Visegrad countries would be a step in this 
direction, he said. "I think Vilnius and Warsaw could join 
efforts to arrange a meeting between Visegrad and Baltic leaders 
this or early next year." 
  During a summit in March, the presidents of Estonia, Latvia 
and Lithuania said their countries will seek to expand 
cooperation on the North-Baltic-Visegrad axis. 
  Discussing pan-European political processes, Brazauskas 
pointed out certain aspects of relations with Russia. He said 
Poland and Lithuania, which have borders with the Kaliningrad 
region, are especially interested in a successful development of 
democratic reforms both in the region and in Russia in general. 
"The Russian Federation could essentially contribute to security 
and stability in the area by gradually transforming the region 
from a military stronghold into a zone of active international 
business." 
  Brazauskas expressed regret that a free trade agreement 
between Lithuania and Russia is blocked and that "a 
commercial-economic agreement does not come into force because 
of Russia's positions. Such a policy is neither positive nor 
having prospects, and it does not stimulate stability in Europe." 
  Commenting on the Lithuanian-Polish friendship and 
cooperation agreement, Brazauskas said "Lithuania achieved its 
most important goals but did not violate any of its essential 
and vital interests. A clever compromise was reached." 
  Brazauskas noted, however, that "Lithuania does not give up 
its principled position that Vilnius and the Vilnius region were 
a part of Poland before the war only by fact, but not lawfully."

  [Text] Vilnius, April 27 -- "The worst in the relations 
between Poland and Lithuania has been left behind. We now 
should show more optimism because everything that is ahead of us 
will certainly be better and nicer", President Lech Walesa said 
in Vilnius on Wednesday. 
  Appearing during a joint press conference the presidents of 
Poland, Lech Walesa, and of Lithuania, Algirdas Brazauskas 
stressed that the Polish-Lithuanian treaty has created 
foundations for further cooperation and it will depend on 
societies of the two countries how these opportunities will be 
utilized. 
  "It seems that the treaty has in a way closed the past. Now 
we are facing the tasks of construction, of the future. Poland 
is prepared for this," President Walesa said. 
  Replying to a question asked by one of the journalists 
concerning the consequences of Lithuania's stand claiming that 
Vilnius and the Vilnius region had illegally belonged to Poland 
in the period between the two world wars, President Brazauskas 
stated: 
  "It is difficult to speak of any consequences after fifty 
years. All the inhabitants of that area are Lithuanian citizens 
and all have to respect the same laws." 
  Walesa confirmed that he is sceptical about the "Partnership 
for Peace" programme and the plan is unsettled and dependent on 
how much will be jointly done. "Poland will encourage other 
countries, including Lithuania, to turn "Partnership for Peace" 
into joint, big and important security for whole Europe" Walesa 
said adding that there is no free Poland without free Lithuania. 
  Asked to comment on the Lithuanian president-voiced proposal 
for a joint meeting of the Baltic states and Visegrad Group 
leaders, Walesa said he is ready for such a meeting. "If 
nations expect us to meet, then the meeting would be advisable. 
If this is Lithuania's wish, I will prompt it to Visegrad 
Group." 
  The presidents agreed that the issues of Kaliningrad 
district 
and transit through Poland or Lithuania have to be settled. The 
Polish president emphasized that Poland and Lithuania will seek 
the transit provided that it is economic, profitable and 
controlled." 
  "Geographically, from the economic and not military point of 
view Kaliningrad is a very good location. We have not heard 
that Poland or Lithuania are willing to invade Russia. From 
what we hear, but in a little bit silent way, Russia is not 
going to invade Poland or Lithuania, either. One has to turn 
the tanks and other hardware into ploughshares. Then transit 
will be profitable for all," Walesa said. 
  Brazauskas told newsmen that Russia should not complain 
about 
transit through his country as it is conducted in compliance 
with international standards.

  [Text] Vilnius, April 27, ELTA -- Polish President Lech 
Walesa by the end of his visit to Lithuania met with 
representatives of the Polish community in Lithuania. 
  According to the statistical data, at present 261.5 thousand 
Poles live in Lithuania. 
  "Despite a great number of obstacles you have not lost your 
nationality", Walesa said. "You still belong to a large Polish 
family. You never reached outside the border, the border 
stretched over you. You are not here guests or newcomers or 
emigrants". 
  Walesa emphasized that Poles in Lithuania are citizens of 
Lithuania. "Lithuania is your country. The prosperity of 
Lithuania is your prosperity. You must be good citizens. You 
must care about your homeland and participate in the changes. 
You must show that you can usefully and creatively work for 
Lithuania in building the common home for both Lithuanians and 
Poles". 
  Poles who live in Lithuania should be loyal for the state 
and 
respect its institutions. The state in its turn should 
guarantee the ability to foster national identity, culture, 
education and language.

"`Stones' on Borders. A Cooling Has Become Apparent in 
Lithuanian-Russian Relations"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- Relations between Vilnius and Moscow, 
which only recently were almost a model of good-neighborliness, 
have started to cool appreciably of late. At a routine briefing 
A. Slezevicius, the republic's prime minister, voiced regret 
that several of his letters to V. Chernomyrdin, leader of the 
Russian Government, have gone unanswered. Moreover, according 
to the premier, Russian economic policy in respect of Lithuania 
is becoming increasingly aggressive. 
  All this has obliged A. Brazauskas, president of the 
republic, to send his own message to Boris Yeltsin. 
Lithuanian-Russian relations were also discussed at a session 
of the Coordinating Council on Foreign Policy. The decisions 
adopted there were evidently quite serious, since the Lithuanian 
head of government declared that "Lithuania will take 
appropriate measures if Russia does not alter its decision 
regulating exports and imports. One of these measures could be 
to restrict the transit of electricity to Kaliningrad Oblast." 
  What has prompted Lithuania's leaders not only to "avoid 
kisses" but even to threaten to "throw stones"? In the opinion 
of certain Russian Embassy staffers in Lithuania -- an opinion 
which coincides, incidentally, with that of the republic 
government's apparatus staffers -- the stumbling block is 
Kaliningrad Oblast, the Russian enclave on the Baltic coast. In 
signing the treaty on trade and economic cooperation back in 
November last year, the Russian premier stipulated, in exchange 
for most-favored-nation status in trade, a number of measures 
providing for Kaliningrad Oblast's life-support system to be 
facilitated. It was a question, in particular, of simplifying 
the fiscal-customs regulations on the border of Lithuania and of 
preferential transit across its territory for Russian freight. 
Today, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes, 
nothing real has been done in this area. Moreover, the 
Lithuanian side does not conceal its reluctance to reach 
agreement on organizing Russian military transit on the basis of 
a bilateral agreement, intending to define its regulations only 
in internal documents. 
  The two states' diplomats are also failing to find a common 
language in questions of delimiting the border. 
  "Unfortunately, it has not been possible to reach any 
compromises," Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas declared after 
returning from the latest round of talks on this question. The 
sea border is the stumbling block. In the Russian side's 
opinion, Lithuania is proposing a solution which runs counter to 
the UN Law of the Sea Convention. The Lithuanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs takes a different stand: Various international 
documents propose different methods for determining the position 
of a sea border, he believes, and the contracting parties single 
out paragraphs which are advantageous to themselves. 
  It can be assumed that the diametrically opposite 
interpretation of international documents is mainly influenced 
not by the sides' competence or even by the experience of the 
participants in the talks. The main reason is the perfectly 
understandable desire to gain possession of the quite 
significant oil fields located on disputed regions of the 
seabed. In our restless times people do not reach agreement 
quickly where there is a smell of oil....

  [Text] Bishkek 27 April TASS -- During a one-day visit to 
Bishkek, Afghan Foreign Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala discussed 
with Kirgiz diplomats the situation on the Afghan-Tajik border 
and development of the two countries' good-neighbourly 
relations. The Afghan Foreign Ministry's head is also to visit 
Tashkent on Wednesday [27 April]. 
  The situation on the Afghan-Tajik border causes serious 
concern to the Kirgizia [Kyrgystan] because its troops are among 
the CIS peacekeeping forces guarding the border. Secondly, 
drugs and arms are illegally transported from Gorno Badakhshan 
in Tajikistan to Kirgizia. Besides, residents of Kirgizia's 
southern regions are concerned over rumours about opposition 
spring offensive on Badakhshan located not far from Kirgizia and 
home for a lot of ethnic Kirgizians. 
  Officials from Kirgiz security services state that the 
rumours about a forthcoming conflict in neighbouring Tajikistan 
do not correspond to reality. President Askar Akayev calls on 
the warring sides to begin negotiations. Nevertheless Kirgizia 
is concerned over every little change in the situation in Gorno 
Badakhshan.

  [Text] Talks on conflict settlement among Armenia,

capital between 3 and 5 May. 
  Speaker of the Kyrgyz Supreme Council Medetkan Sherimkulov,

  [Text] Tajik opposition forces are readying for an attack 
on the Ishkashimski border guard unit in Gorni Badakhshan. 
  According to military sources, the opposition forces are 
planning to disrupt efforts to defend the Tajikistan-Afghanistan 
border and to capture Army hardware and ammunition for their 
further use against Dushanbe Government troops. 
  The opposition buildup of up to 1,500 men is seen as a sign 
of preparations for the attack. Reconnaissance missions are 
being carried out to try to familiarize with the strength and 
technical capabilities as well as daily routine of the border 
guard units, and the system of fortifications under their 
control. 
  Both the command of the Russian border guards in Tajikistan 
and the unit's commanders are taking actions to be ready to 
rebuff possible attacks and insure the safety of their units.

  [Text] Dushanbe 27 April TASS -- Rizvon Alimardon, one of 
the leaders of irreconcilable Tajik armed opposition in exile, 
called on citizens of Tajikistan to support jihad (holy war) 
against the present regime in the republic. 
  He calls himself commander of united armed forces of Tajik 
Mujahideen. The appeal was printed in leaflets circulated in 
some residential areas of Dushanbe on Tuesday [26 April] as well 
as in the suburban Kofirnikhonskiy, Leninskiy and some other 
districts of the republic. 
  The appeal signed by Rizvon says that the present 
"pro-communist government" is responsible for all social and 
economic evils of the Republic as well as impoverishment of its 
citizens. Therefore, the government should immediately step 
down. 
  Leaflets spell out in detail instructions on how to organise 
resistance to government forces and to give aid to detachments 
of domestic opposition existing in the Republic. 
  Competent Tajik bodies confirmed to ITAR-TASS the appearance 
of anti-government leaflets, calling them a provocation by the 
extremist wing of opposition, aimed at destabilising the social 
and political situation and thwarting the second round of the 
intra-Tajik talks on national reconciliation, which is to be 
held late in May in a Moslem Mid-East country. 
  It was stressed that, since leaflets contained a call for an 
overthrow of the constitutional system in Tajikistan by force, 
competent bodies instituted a criminal case in connection with 
this action.

  [Text] Dushanbe 27 April TASS -- Tajikistan leadership is 
deeply concerned over the escalation of terroristic actions 
along the Tajik-Afghan border, the Tajik Foreign Ministry said 
in a statement circulated on Wednesday. 
  Tajik Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zafar Saidov told ITAR-TASS 
that according to "irrefutable evidence" a thousand and a half 
Tajik rebels are massing in the Afghan border village of 
Bakhorak. The group is headed by Abdul Rashid Badakhshi, 
commander of the so-called Badakhshan Resistance Front. The 
rebels plan to intrude into Tajikistan's inner mountainous 
regions and launch military actions against the government 
troops, he said. 
  Abdul Basir Khalid, commander of Afghanistan 29th Army 
controlling the region where the rebels are based, is not only 
tolerant to all their actions but assists rebels, Saidov said. 
  Tajikistan leadership considers such actions as open 
hostility against the government and as an attempt to provoke a 
new armed confrontation in the Republic, and warns that the 
government will make appropriate moves to prevent provocative 
actions. 
  The Tajik Government appeals to all Afghanistan-based rebels 
to give up irresponsible actions and turn to search for 
political decisions whithin the framework of the inter-Tajik 
negotiating process.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 28 Apr -- The Tajik Special Services 
arrested several people in Dushanbe on Wednesday [27 April] for 
disseminating antigovernment leaflets calling for the armed 
overthrow of the Republic's present regime. Those arrested were 
caught red-handed with a stack of proclamations. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told this today by the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs press center, which declined to give more information in 
view of the interests of the investigation. 
  Two days ago in Dushanbe and adjacent areas unidentified 
people distributed proclamations signed by Rizvon Alimardon, one 
of the leaders of the irreconcileable opposition in exile, who 
calls himself commander of the Joint Armed Forces of the Islamic 
Revival Movement of Tajikistan, calling on compatriots to wage a 
general armed struggle against the "pro-Communist government." 
According to the authors of the leaflets, the pro-Communist 
forces are mainly to blame for the civil war that has been 
unleashed in Tajikistan, and on coming to power they "brought 
the people to complete destitution." According to the 
proclamation, the "Red Plague" in Tajikistan should be destroyed.

  [Text] Tashkent, 26 Apr -- France is prepared to assist 
Uzbekistan in the modernization of its economy, said French 
President Francois Mitterrand at talks here with Uzbek President 
Islam Karimov. They touched upon various aspects of 
French-Uzbek economic cooperation. 
  Regarding the two major projects in which French firms are 
participating -- the construction of an oil refinery in Bukhara 
and the modernization of Uzbek air traffic control systems -- 
Mitterrand expressed France's readiness to guarantee the credits 
it needs to the sum of 700 million francs. 
  He stressed that France's participation in the modernization 
of Uzbekistan's economy does not stop there. Many French 
enterprises, whose representatives arrived in Uzbekistan 
together with the official delegation, he said, have been 
attracted by the possibility of cooperation with their Uzbek 
counterparts in various sectors of the economy, such as sugar 
and textile production, gas, the construction of airports, 
interbank activities, and also in cotton growing and water 
conservancy. 
  France will help Uzbekistan to acquire financial assistance 
from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, as 
well as credits for European technical assistance, the French 
president stressed.

  [Text] Tashkent, 27 April (TASS) -- "The ultimatum against 
Bosnian Serbs is a forced measure authorised by the 
international community. I shall only welcome if its conditions 
are observed," French President Francois Mitterrand told a news 
conference in Tashkent on Tuesday where he is on a state visit. 
  France prefers a peaceful solution of the problem, the 
president continued. Therefore, "we support the initiative to 
call an international conference with the participation of 
Russia, the United States and the European Union under the U.N. 
aegis. 
  "Russia and the U.S. are now discussing this proposal. To 
all appearances, its convocation can take one month. Therefore, 
I conveyed my opinion to Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton that 
such a conference should be called at the earliest. If possible 
-- immediately. 
  "All initial data for settling the problem are known. They 
were discussed for many months. It is necessary, at long last, 
for the great powers, in contact with the warring sides, to find 
a solution meeting their interests." 
  Replying to ITAR-TASS, Mitterrand stressed that, following 
the collapse of the Soviet Union, some concern developed in 
Europe over a future military and political situation. 
  "To maintain political stability and security," he said, "we 
have several mechanisms at our disposal. These are the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the 
U.S.-brokered `Partnership for Peace' programme. 
  "Last but not least, this is an idea put forth by France to 
call an international conference at which we suggest that a pact 
on stability in Europe be concluded and that obligations of all 
countries be defined on preventing and settling conflicts at the 
earliest possible stage." 
  Mitterrand also noted that he understands Russia's 
hesitations concerning its accession to NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace" programme. "Russia is a great country, and it remains a 
nuclear power. It led the system opposing NATO. 
  "Such a confrontation was fraught with war but at the same 
time, it served as a balance of forces." The president did not 
want to give advice to Russia how to get out of this situation. 
"It should make its own choice," he stressed.

  [Text] Tashkent, 27 April (TASS) -- The presidents of 
France and Uzbekistan have expressed profound satisfaction with 
the results of Francois Mitterrand's visit to Uzbekistan and 
confidence in the bright future of relations between the two 
states. "The talks and frank conversations we've had," Uzbek 
President Karimov told a press conference here on Tuesday 
evening, "has shown that Uzbekistan and France have identical 
views on pressing international and regional problems. We 
regard France as a reliable partner, which has huge political 
weight." The Uzbek president believes that France is setting an 
example of how to promote equitable and mutually advantageous 
relations with young sovereign states. 
  "We had signed fundamental documents half a year ago in 
Paris 
and today we are adding concrete substance to them," the French 
president said. "The French side has already provided financial 
guarantees to some major joint ventures. Fruitful cooperation 
between our two countries is perfectly feasible." 
  The sides have also discussed the situation in Central Asia, 
including Tajikistan and Afghanistan, various aspects of 
cooperation in the military-political sphere and in the 
switchover of defence enterprises to civilian rails, some 
concrete projects of economic cooperation. 
  Mitterrand will visit the gem of Uzbekistan -- Samarkand -- 
today morning. In the afternoon he will go to Ashkhabad for a 
two-day state visit. He will hold talks with Turkmenian 
President Saparmurat Niyazov. The sides are expected to sign a 
treaty of friendship and cooperation.

  [Text] In the second half of the day, the French president 
visited the National Park in the capital of the Republic and 
placed a wreath at the monument of Ali Sheri Navoi, an 
outstanding poet and statesman. The president of Uzbekistan 
spoke to the highly esteemed guest on the great respect which 
the people of Uzbekistan have for the talent of this great poet 
who has left behind philosophical works and poems. On his side, 
Francois Mitterrand noted the ever increasing role of Uzbekistan 
in the world community. 
  Following this, talks were held between the two presidents 
on 
a number of questions of mutual interest. Official talks 
between the French and Uzbek delegations were also held here 
with the participation of the heads of state. Joint documents 
were signed on the results of the talks, including the agreement 
between the governments of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the 
Republic of France on cooperation between the ministries for 
internal affairs, a joint declaration on cooperation in the 
field of air transport, and an agreement between France and 
Uzbekistan on the freedom of movement of the citizens. 
  A news conference was held after this by President Francois 
Mitterrand and President Islam Karimov. Our correspondent 
Aleksandr [word indistinct] now reports. 
  [Correspondent] This news conference at which the heads of 
both states spoke on the major results of the visit attracted 
unusually large attention from the representatives of the mass 
media, including correspondents from home and abroad and 
correspondents as well as from well-known French media. Opening 
the news conference Uzbek President Islam Karimov: 
  [Begin Karimov recording, in Russian] We attach great 
importance to the visit of Francois Mitterrand, president of the 
Republic of France, to Uzbekistan and consider it an important 
step for the development of bilateral relations between our 
countries. The talks held during the visit and the frank talks 
with the president demonstrated the similarity of positions of 
Uzbekistan and France on [word indistinct] international and 
regional problems, once again confirming the sincere efforts of 
both countries to develop and strengthen mutually advantageous 
cooperation in all spheres. [end Karimov recording] 
  This is what French President Francois Mitterrand stated at 
the news conference when evaluating the talks and the signed 
agreements. 
  [Begin Mitterrand recording in French, fading into 
correspondent's report in Russian] The current meeting, says 
Mitterrand, is a continuation of our meeting with President 
Karimov six months ago in France during which the Paris [word 
indistinct] and the agreement on cooperation between the two 
countries were signed. We were able to achieve agreements in 
the political and in the military field. I would like to take 
(?this opportunity) to thank the president for the warm 
reception, and would like to state to you that we [word 
indistinct] Uzbekistan as a country with a rich culture and a 
great future. It must be noted, said Mitterrand, that relations 
between our countries are taking on a regular character. This 
allows us to hope for their dynamic development. Presidents 
Islam Karimov and Francois Mitterrand answered the many 
questions of the journalists.

  [Text] Tashkent 27 April TASS -- "I have no doubts that we 
needed the Commonwealth of Independent States. Otherwise we 
would have had a Yugoslavian version here after the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. History shows that such apprehensions are 
grounded," Uzbek President Islam Karimov told a joint press 
conference here, devoted to the results of French President 
Francois Mitterrand's state visit to Uzbekistan. 
  Replying to an ITAR-TASS question, the Uzbek leader noted 
that he believed the future of the CIS lay in economic 
integration, including the formation of inter-state 
transcontinental corporations, which could unite Russian and 
Uzbek enterprises in joint-stock societies. 
  "We believe that the future of the CIS depends precisely on 
the formation of such associations, uniting the enterprises of 
Russia, Uzbekistan, and other republics. It will be even better 
if such associations are created not on a bilateral, but on a 
multilateral basis," Karimov stressed. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the idea of the Euro-Asian 
union, recently voiced by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, 
Karimov said: "Much is left unsaid when the term Euro-Asian is 
used. If this implies a single parliament, single suprastate 
structures and even a single citizenship and a single 
constitution, it means the restoration of the old union, no 
matter how it is called. I am vehemently opposed to any 
comeback of the past. It is not for this that we have achieved 
sovereignty and are now engaged in national revival. There is 
no return to the past. History moves only ahead." 
  "To put it in a nutshell," Karimov stated, "the Euro-Asian 
idea smacks very much of populism, no matter who voices it."

<F P=106> [Report by Shakhabutdin Zaynutdinov: "Tighter Currency </F>
Control in Uzbekistan"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- A new statute has come into effect in 
Uzbekistan controlling foreign economic transactions by 
individuals and corporate bodies. 
  This has been done, it is believed here, primarily to 
strengthen currency circulation in the Republic and increase the 
purchasing power of sum coupons during the transition to an 
official national currency. It is laid down that quotas for the 
export of goods (works, services) cannot be sold, transferred or 
reallocated to other corporate bodies. 
  A ban has been imposed on the settlement of accounts for 
foreign economic transactions by Uzbekistan enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions with foreign partners, including 
CIS countries, through firms' accounts in foreign banks. They 
are only allowed to open currency accounts in authorized 
Uzbekistan banks if properly registered as participants in 
foreign economic activity. Each corporate body is entitled to 
open such an account in only one establishment of an authorized 
bank; except that, if the bank in question lacks the credit 
resources, credit can be obtained by agreement with another bank. 
  All contracts concluded by enterprises with foreign 
partners, 
including partners in CIS countries, for the export of licensed 
goods, works, and services will be subject to registration at 
the local Foreign Economic Relations Ministry. The statute 
envisages the obligatory sale of currency earnings (including 
CIS countries' currencies) to the Republic Central Bank, with 
the simultaneous payment of the equivalent in sum coupons into 
the enterprise's clearing account at the current rate.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila </F>
Glazovskaya and Mikhail Kalmykov] 
  [Excerpt] Ashgabat, 28 Apr -- Talks between French 
President Francois Mitterrand, who is in Ashgabat on a state 
visit, and Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov centered around 
the situation in Central Asia and the difficult situation in 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The first round of talks took place 
late on Wednesday [27 April] evening. 
  Conducting a policy of positive neutrality and open doors, 
Turkmenistan is seriously concerned by the security problems 
close to its borders. As the Turkmen leader noted during the 
talks, the country's decision to adhere to the Partnership for 
Peace Program will enable it to pursue more actively ideas of 
broad international cooperation in its foreign policy. He 
pointed out that the program could become a real means of 
guaranteeing not only the security of the peoples of Europe, but 
of the regions that it borders. 
  The Turkmen side took pleasure in noting that by displaying 
its practical aspiration toward organizing a dialogue between 
East and West, France had of late been paying more attention to 
the Central Asian region -- an explosive region of the world. 
In the opinion of Turkmen diplomacy, the conflicts in 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan pose a serious threat to 
international security. 
  In turn, Francois Mitterrand welcomed the role being played 
by independent Turkmenistan in helping to resolve conflicts and 
overcome crises in the region peacefully. "We wish for a return 
to civil peace in Afghanistan and want that country to find 
internal accord once again. The United Nations must be brought 
more actively into this process to relieve the suffering of a 
people that has come into collision with the misfortune of war," 
the French president said. Recalling the proloned conflict in 
Afghanistan, he voiced his hope that Ashgabat would continue in 
the search for a peaceful settlement in that country. [passage

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- Vyacheslav Kostikov, press 
secretary of the Russian president, has described the signing of 
the Treaty on Social Accord as "a very major event in the 
history of Russia." 
  The treaty "has become a reality," "Russia has entered a new 
political and historical dimension, and the foundations for the 
civilized existence of a civil society have been laid," he told 
journalists after the treaty signing ceremony. 
  The press secretary said: "Only three people did not sign 
the 
treaty. They were Mr. Zyuganov, the leader of the Communist 
faction; Mr. Vinogradov, chairman of the Vladimir Oblast 
Soviet; and Mr. Tuleyev, chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Soviet."

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- The State Duma faction of 
the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] ruled on Tuesday 
that its leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will personally take a 
decision whether to sign or not the memorandum on civic peace 
and accord on behalf of the faction. 
  The main argument in favour of this rather unusual decision 
was that Zhirinovskiy's "intuition has never let him down in 
such cases". 
  In turn, Zhirinovskiy said that he will take the final 
decision on Thursday morning (the date scheduled for a ceremony 
of signing the accord) "maybe after consulting" his party 
leadership. 
  The LDPR faction expressed doubt that Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin has the right to sign the memorandum on behalf of the 
lower chamber of the Russian Parliament. The faction is going 
to submit their doubts for Duma's consideration on Wednesday.

  [Text] The Centrist Bloc of Political Parties and Movements 
headed by Vladimir Voronin has made a statement against signing 
the Agreement on Civil Accord. 
  In the statement published Tuesday, the bloc pointed out 
that 
the president and those close to him needed civil accord for the 
sole purpose of "doing away with any possibility for society to 
criticize the official line and therefore allow those who have 
been granted access to power in any way, but demonstrated their 
complete incapacity for managing a great country, to remain in 
power for at least another couple of years, maybe more." 
  The bloc believes civil accord could be achieved through 
early presidential elections and forming a new government. 
  The bloc called on all political parties and movements, 
"healthy forces" in all branches of power and the people to 
support early presidential elections and other related social 
and state reforms. 
  On the same day, the bloc proposed the Patriarch of Moscow 
and All Russia Aleksiy II call on the people to refrain from any 
political activities on Easter day, May 1.

  [Text] Russian presidential aide Georgiy Satarov in an 
interview with Interfax on Tuesday spoke against the 
transformation of the treaty on civil accord from a political 
document into a judicial one. 
  In particular, he considers it inexpedient to hold a 
referendum or a plebiscite on the treaty, as well as its 
adoption as a federal law. In his opinion, responsibility for 
non-observance of the agreement should be more of a moral 
character. In this connection, Satarov pointed out the role of 
media as one of the most effective controllers of the treaty's 
implementation by the sides. 
  Satarov suggested that relations between those who will sign 
the document on April 28 and "non-signatories" will be built 
"normally." To prove his viewpoint he cited an episode during 
the recent meeting between Boris Yeltsin and leaders of the 
factions; when reacting to sharp criticism of the draft by a 
Yabloko representative Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy, the president 
said: "Whatever you say about the agreement, we will still be 
friends." 
  "The non-signing of the treaty does not mean discrimination 
against nonaligned public organizations," Satarov pointed out. 
Otherwise, he said, "the idea of civil accord itself would be 
discredited." 
  Satarov noted that the process of civil reconciliation 
should 
not be exhausted with the conclusion of the treaty. He 
considers the mechanism for the solution of concrete problems as 
the most important issue in the document. Satarov has in view 
one of the functions of the conciliatory commission, to be 
created under the treaty, which will organize roundtable 
meetings and working groups on various issues. 
  The presidential aide said that "according to latest 
reports" 
about 220 people had been invited to the ceremony of signing the 
civil accord treaty on Thursday.

<F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Trade Unions" rubric: </F>
"FITUR Ready To Sign Memorandum on Accord, But Demands Some 
Additions to it"] 
  [Text] Stanislav Kramarenko, adviser to the chairman of 
the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR], 
told your SEGODNYA correspondent yesterday about the Federation 
leaders' intention to sign the memorandum on accord. According 
to Stanislav Kramarenko, FITUR political leaders find themselves 
"in a difficult situation" because they are getting numerous 
cables and letters from primary trade union organizations in 
which the signing of the memorandum "is hedged" with the most 
varied demands. In a number of trade union organizations, the 
adviser thinks, the "civic accord" notion is interpreted as 
"accord in the area of a single approach to economic reforms," 
although it implies a treaty of principles between public and 
political organizations on the existence together with power 
structures without a rigid standoff and upheavals. 
  In this situation, according to the adviser, the FITUR 
political leadership proceeds from the fact that trade unions 
are supposed to state their readiness to conduct with the 
current president, government, Federal Assembly, the State Duma, 
as well as with the other participants in the agreement, a 
constructive dialogue on a platform of civic accord. The FITUR 
leadership also believes that "the most important interests of 
working people can be protected only within the framework of a 
powerful state," the adviser stated. 
  At the same time, Stanislav Kramarenko underscored that the 
agreement "should not be signed at the expense of working 
people's interests." For his part, FITUR Chairman Mikhail 
Shmakov passed on the main remarks and proposals to Boris 
Topornin, chairman of the public chamber under the president, 
and, during a recent meeting with Boris Yeltsin confirmed, the 
need for their inclusion in the text of the memorandum. Among 
these proposals, perhaps the main ones are to ensure the 
implementation of the principles of social partnership detailed 
in the General Agreement between the trade unions, employers, 
and the government; to follow an active social policy aimed at 
"stabilization and subsequent raising of people's living 
standards; adapting the able-bodied population to new economic 
conditions..." 
  If these proposals go through, Stanislav Kramarenko thinks, 
FITUR-member trade unions would fundamentally have no special 
remarks to make about the other sections of the memorandum. 
Besides, "in a bid to strike off many existing trade union 
demands" the federation leaders insist on the inclusion in the 
text of the agreement, in the item on pledges by trade unions 
and their amalgamations, "not to hold and not to participate in 
organizing strikes aimed at redistributing budget funds," an 
amendment -- "after the budget has been approved." Virtually 
all Federation trade unions now vigorously uphold this amendment 
because in this case they reserve the right to collective 
actions, including strikes, before the budget has been approved. 
  According to a FITUR information and analysis center report, 
the Federation General Council's executive committee made a 
decision late last night "to form a delegation for the signing 
of the memorandum."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Price of Signature Is Civil Peace. </F>
Process of Signing Document on Public Accord Begins in Kremlin 
Tomorrow"] 
  [Text] Kursk Oblast Administration Head Vasiliy Shuteyev: 
  Let me say straightaway that as head of the administration 
of 
a Federation component I will certainly sign the draft "peace" 
agreement proposed by the president. 
  Needless to say, the text needs some adjustments and we will 
obviously do that during the discussion. But this is purely a 
question of editing: Some provisions that do not duplicate the 
constitution can be expanded, while some can be shortened; 
however, it is not the details that should be primarily worrying 
us today but the essence, objectives, and positive qualities of 
the document. And the essence of the document is that the 
signatories are making the appropriate commitments, aware that 
Russia has no future without the agreement. 
  Khabarovsk Kray Administration Head Viktor Ishayev: 
  Everyone has gotten well and truly sick of the constant 
wrangling in our society and I think that the Federation 
components will favor consolidation in any form. The agreement 
on civil accord is essential. And we have already said that it 
must be signed. 
  We, the people of the Far East, are most concerned about the 
economic basis for consolidation. Local administration heads 
believe that the unequal economic conditions both between the 
territories themselves and in relations with the government that 
exist for instance for krays, oblasts, and republics within 
Russia may become an unpopular political factor. Khabarovsk 
Kray, which borders on Yakutia for instance, is cannot help 
seeing that the latter receives privileges from the center. Yet 
we have exactly the same problems. And we too are an equal 
Federation component. So let us create equal conditions for all. 
  Bryansk Oblast Administration Head Vladimir Karpov: 
  Along with the other administration heads, I signed an 
appeal 
to political parties and movements following the meeting with 
the president. Accord is vitally necessary in Russia today. I 
am convinced that the country has no future unless reforms are 
continued, the norms of a civil society are established, and 
economic and political stability are ensured. The tasks facing 
society are too complex to waste effort on political 
confrontation and continue the protracted political games. 
  A compromise is possible and necessary. Everyone merely has 
to be able to get over their arrogance in order to rescue the 
country and cast aside their political passions and ambitions. 
  Novosibirsk Mayor Viktor Tolokonskiy: 
  I think that most people of Novosibirsk fully understand the 
need for the civil accord that the Russian president has 
proposed. But at the same time many people are worried that the 
conclusion of this agreement might prolong the state of apathy 
and inactivity in the parliament and government. And I think 
that the proposed form of civil peace and accord should also be 
a pledge for all its signatories at once to get down in earnest 
to effective work to extricate the country from crisis.

  [Text] President Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov sees the 
rejection, by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, of 
the agreement on civic accord as a sign of inconsistency. In an 
interview with INTERFAX Satarov accused Communist leader 
Gennadiy Ziuganov of failing to voice his objections to the 
agreement at the April 22 meeting between Boris Yeltsin and the 
leaders of the parliamentary factions. Ziuganov rejected the 
agreement at a party conference last Saturday. 
  Satarov said that at the April 22 meeting Ziuganov came out 
with a number of constructive suggestions which were taken into 
consideration by the authors of the agreement. 
  Later Ziuganov said that the agreement aimed to perpetuate 
the negative tendencies which led to the destabilization of 
society and Russian state structures. Satarov saw his statement 
as a clear-cut attempt to call white - black. 
  In Satarov's view, the agreement aimed to promote social 
accord and civic stability. And, he said, the document was 
phrased by a working group which brought together 
representatives of all parliamentary factions, including the 
Communists and Agrarians, meaning, according to Satarov, that 
their criticism of the agreement backfires on themselves. 
  Satarov failed to understand what Ziuganov meant by calling 
for sweeping changes in the social and economic policies and 
describing the civic accord agreement an ultimatum to the 
opposition. What Ziuganov said was something on the order of an 
ultimatum rather than a call for accord, Satarov said. 
  Satarov was confident that in spite of the negative moves by 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the YaBloko 
grouping and some other organizations, the country's leading 
social and political forces would voice approval of the 
agreement on April 28.

support to Boris Yeltsin's initiative to sign an agreement on 
civil peace. BUSINESS-TASS reports that the document will be 
signed by Sergey Yegorov, president of the association. 
  A statement issued by the management of the Association of 
Russian Banks says that it will be impossible to solve any 
serious problems of either economic or social transformations in 
Russia without guarantees of a political stability in the 
society, and without the support of a growing civil peace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Before Signing Your Autograph"] </F>
  [Text] Some crucial documents were adopted at a conference 
of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] held 
last weekend. They include the theses "The CPRF on the Path to 
Accord for Russia's Sake." They say: Formulating a tactical 
task, the CPRF proceeds from the premise that it is insufficient 
to put forward general program aims, whose full implementation 
is only possible when the people of labor come to power -- there 
must be a plan for specific actions. 
  The CPRF believes that preserving civil peace and 
strengthening it on the basis of switching to a socialist method 
of development are vital conditions for averting a 
national-state disaster. 
  To this end, the CPRF proposes: 
  -- to form a broad coalition of left-wing, centrist, 
patriotic, and popular-democratic forces capable of 
neutralizing, and then politically, economically, and morally 
isolating, the "party of civil war"; 
  -- to bring the coalition to power as the result of victory 
at elections or another peaceful, non-violent method. 
  The CPRF realizes that achieving civil peace is not a 
one-shot act of signing some kind of solemn statement, it is not 
a declaration, but a package of steps which are perceptible in a 
practical sense and are primarily aimed at eliminating specific 
sources of civil confrontation. Today these sources, "risk 
factors" of a kind, include the sharp property stratification 
against the backdrop of an unrestrainable fall in production and 
inflationary processes, and the violation of the workers' 
socioeconomic rights. 
  The Communists are prepared to propose a package of measures 
to reestablish legality in the country. 
  The Communists see a change in the socioeconomic course as 
another very important precondition for reestablishing civil 
peace. A full program for the economic improvement of the 
situation in the country and a way out of the crisis may be 
agreed only through the joint efforts of all interested parties. 
  But a number of measures will brook no delay. These include: 
  -- putting a stop to the plundering privatization, checking 
the legality and economic expediency of all deals which have 
already been concluded, and clarifying the origins of the 
capital invested in privatization; 
  -- making legislative provision for the most important 
rights 
of working collectives to own and use national property and to 
choose specific forms of destatization where this is 
economically justified, and banning interference in the economic 
life of enterprises in collective-group forms of ownership, 
particularly in the agro-industrial complex; 
  -- recompensing the losses borne by citizens and economic 
organizations as a result of the "shock therapy," and finding 
ways of settling the nonpayments crisis, eliminating debts in 
wages, and indexing savings deposits, and indeed not by means of 
an extra emission but by freezing illegally accumulated capitals.

  [Text] The Russia's Choice faction has doubts in terms of 
the signing of the agreement on civic accord. At the special 
meeting on Tuesday the faction discussed the draft statement 
which says that on April 25 the president's administration 
agreed to groundless concessions to the separatist tendancies of 
regional elites, by excluding from the text the unconditional 
priority of the Constitution of the Russian Federation over the 
constitutions of the Federation's constituent members. In view 
of this, the faction said that this violated the will of the 
people of Russia who voted on December 12, 1993 for the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation. The statement says that 
the faction can sign the treaty without the above changes. 
  Faction members have proposed several wordings. Deputy Gleb 
Yakunin proposed to recommend that the Russian president 
postpone the signing ceremony before the treaty's text is fully 
coordinated. 
  The faction will make the final decision on the signing 
before its morning meeting on Wednesday.

  [Text] The Democratic Russia Movement supports public 
concord in Russia, however, suggests postponing the signing on 
civic accord from April 28 for a later date. 
  In an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin, the movement's 
leaders Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin motivate their suggestion 
by the fact that on the threshold of the accord's signing the 
newspaper IZVESTIYA carried an article with anti-constitutional 
calls by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia -- LDPR] 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  Zhirinovskiy proposes that "sovereign republics be done away 
with," "the sovereign presidents unwilling to transform into 
governors be medically examined in Moscow," that former Soviet 
republics reunite with Russia as provinces, and a crusade 
southwards to the Indian Ocean be launched. 
  Ponomarev and Yakunin wonder for this reason "can the 
presidents and leaders of the republic within the Russian 
Federation put their signatures on the accord next to that of 
Zhirinovskiy?" 
  They insist that Zhirinovskiy should either publicly 
renounce 
his anticonstitutional calls or be barred from signing the 
document.

  [Text] "Some shifts in direction for satisfying those who 
do not share the president's stand have been made in the draft 
agreement on civic accord, but these changes are quite 
insignificant, and they do not alter the current course 
fundamentally." This statement was made in an interview with 
INTERFAX by Anatoliy Lukyanov, member of the State Duma, who 
belongs to the unregistered Russian Way faction. 
  Lukyanov commented on a televised statement by the former 
vice president Aleksander Rutskoy, who said that he is willing 
to lead those forces opposed to the president, which refuse to 
sign the agreement on civic accord. 
  According to Lukyanov, "if, with the silent consent of Boris 
Yeltsin, the pro-president and pro-government press begins to 
harass those who refuse to sign the agreement, the authorities 
themselves will push them toward Rutskoy." The Yavlinskiy 
faction in the State Duma might also join the opposition bloc, 
he said. 
  "We are open to union with all patriotic forces with which 
our positions coincide to some extent," Lukyanov declared. He 
referred to the fact that at the December-12 referendum not only 
the Communists, the Agrarians and the Russian Pan-National 
Union, but also the Yavlinskiy bloc, stood against adopting a 
new constitution.

ataman of the union Major-General V. Ratiyev and head of the

unites over 15 million people living in various Russian regions, 
is ready to sign 'the agreement on civic accord in russia' and 
carry its share of responsibility for the agreement fulfilment. 
  "In this connection we consider inadmissible attempts of any 
parties, including the Agrarian Union to voice a different 
opinion on behalf of those who actually live and work on the 
land. 
  "We, Cossacks, can estimate ourselves the significance of 
the 
civic accord agreement for peace and tranquility on lands 
traditionally populated by Cossacks".

  [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin on 
Wednesday visited the headquarters of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service (FIS) of Russia and met with its leadership and staff. 
  Yeltsin first visited the FIS headquarters in Yasenevo on 
December 26, 1991. At that time his meeting with the leading 
personnel of the FIS was marked by an official confirmation of 
academician Yevgeniy Primakov, Dr. of Science (Economics), as 
the FIS chief, and a call "to tackle more actively the 
accomplishment of current tasks". 
  The FIS was established by a presidential decree dated 
December 18, 1991. It is the successor to the former first 
directorate of the Soviet Union's KGB and the Central 
Intelligence Service of the USSR (from November to December 
1991).

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Ovcharenko and Sergey Postanogov: </F>
"President Has Visited Intelligence Service"] 
  [Text] Yesterday was a holiday for our intelligence 
agents: For the first time in the entire history of the foreign 
intelligence service's existence the valiant "knights of the 
cloak and dagger" were visited by the Russian president himself, 
who addressed the collective in an 800-seat auditorium at the 
foreign intelligence service headquarters. Actually, the 
audience was far bigger because his speech was transmitted on 
the radio communication system. 
  According to our information what particularly pleased the 
intelligence agents was the specific nature of the president's 
speech and his extensive acquaintance with a whole series of the 
foreign intelligence service's specific problems. 
  What was the thrust of the speech? Unemployment obviously 
does not threaten the foreign intelligence service staffers. As 
the president said, "under conditions where military budgets are 
being reduced, intelligence becomes a very important guarantee 
of security and that means that the role of the intelligence 
service must and will grow." "The supreme function of the 
foreign intelligence service," the Russian leader stressed, "is 
to serve Russia's national and state interests." 
  The president admitted that the foreign intelligence service 
has a high reputation in the system of Russian state power. "I 
believe that your operational information, analytical 
conclusions, and recommendations will receive only high 
assessments," he noted. The guest stressed that Russia will 
strengthen the intelligence service -- that is the authorities' 
intention and, which is even more interesting, the president's 
personal understanding of this issue. 
  So is Yeltsin's visit to the foreign intelligence service an 
attempt to improve our intelligence agents' morale or an attempt 
to render them their due for their work? Most likely both. And 
it is irrelevant whether Ames was a Russian special services 
agent. Probably now even if you are not a specialist in the 
affairs of the foreign intelligence services you can imagine 
that the situation over Bosnia and the trouble spots in the 
former USSR republics require close attention and strenuous work 
from the intelligence service. 
  Concluding his speech the Russian president had a one on one 
meeting with the leader of the foreign intelligence service. 
  It is not out of the question that meetings like yesterday's 
will become traditional. To spite our enemies?!

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin thinks that Russia's 
relations with Western countries have recently radically 
improved and that Russia has attained the level of partnership 
as far as some of these countries are concerned. However, he 
told today's meeting with the chiefs and staffers of the foreign 
intelligence service, "it is now particularly important to draw 
a distinction between partnership and attempts to dominate or to 
foist on us their own actions, which run counter to Russia's 
interests. It is unacceptable to Russia." 
  Russia, stressed Boris Yeltsin, has its own view of the 
priorities in the foreign and domestic policies and it also has 
interests of its own on the international arena. This is 
convincingly shown in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis and 
Russia's activities in close neighboring countries. However, 
noted the president "we have recently come to see clearly that 
such activities by Russia do at times cause irritation." Boris 
Yeltsin expressed the thought that the political campaign 
surrounding the so-called "Ames" affair illustrates this 
clearly. The real motives and goals of this anti-Russian 
action, continued the president of Russia, have clear political 
overtones. 
  Boris Yeltsin said that American intelligence is stepping up 
its efforts to acquire an agent network in Russia, but U.S. 
special services think that the foreign intelligence service and 
its military colleagues from the GRU have no right to act in the 
same manner. "I can give assurances," said the President, "that 
Russia is no longer prepared to reconcile itself with this kind 
of discrimination. We are ready to take all the measures 
provided for in international law to rectify the situation." 
  "Russia," stressed Boris Yeltsin, "is for an equal and 
mutually advantageous cooperation and mutual respect, and I 
believe that our partners will learn to take account of our 
position."

  [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- The Russian Intelligence 
Service must be one of the leading think tanks working to 
stabilise the situation in the world and avert threats to the 
national security of the country, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said at a meeting with foreign intelligence leaders in 
Moscow on Wednesday. 
  The president said special attention should be paid to 
forecasting problems which Russia may face in the near future 
and in a long-term perspective. 
  Although the period of global confrontation is over and the 
vector of the world's development is on the whole favourable for 
Russia "we must remember that its direction may change," Yeltsin 
noted. He believes that "the world is standing at a crossroads, 
largely because Russia, one of the great powers, is going 
through the transition period." 
  "You should know that there are forces abroad which would 
like to keep Russia in the state of uncontrolled paralysis," 
Yeltsin continued. He stressed that "only a strong, democratic 
and prosperous Russian state can become a factor which will 
bring the world a new perspective. It is our common task to 
make this goal a reality." 
  "The ultimate objective of foreign intelligence is to serve 
the state interests of Russia. We will strengthen it and 
promote the authority of those who work in it. This is not only 
the president's opinion, this is my policy," he said. 
  In conditions when the military budget is shrinking, the 
role 
of intelligence grows considerably and information it supplies 
becomes a major guarantee of the country's security, the 
president noted. 
  Yeltsin pointed out that the foreign intelligence service 
has 
a high reputation in Russia's system of power. "I hope that your 
prompt information, analytical conclusions and recommendations 
will receive only the highest marks," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia is interested 
in stepping up the integration processes within the framework of 
the CIS and will strive to play a more active role in them. 
However, as President Boris Yeltsin stressed today at a meeting 
with the leadership and members of staff of the Foreign 
Intelligence Service, some politicians in the West regard this 
as proof of the revival of the former imperialist claims of 
Russia. In his opinion this far- fetched thesis is being used 
to cause an artificial exacerbation of relations among the CIS 
and the Baltic countries with Russia. 
  Rejecting the concept of "global" and "total" intelligence 
activity, Boris Yeltsin thinks it necessary to systematically 
keep track of the situation throughout the perimeter of the 
frontiers of Russia. In this connection, he stressed, the 
Foreign Intelligence Service has a crucial task to tackle -- to 
obtain advance information on the relevant plans and intensions 
of the leading countries of the West with regard to Russia's 
neighbors, and to make timely proposals to neutralize this type 
of design.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Armed conflicts near 
Russia's borders, which in some places are threatening to spread 
onto its territory, represent a direct threat to the country. 
In this connection, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin stressed 
today at a meeting with the heads and employees of the Foreign 
Intelligence Service [FIS], that the Russian intelligence 
service must reveal, in good time, the moving forces behind each 
conflict and the opportunities for settling it by political 
means and by compromise. 
  Speaking about the intelligence service's tasks in 
guaranteeing the Russian Federation's national security, the 
president noted that the country's leaders need in-depth and 
accurate assessments of foreign states' approaches toward Russia 
and the processes occurring there. "It is important to uncover 
and skilfully frustrate outside attempts to influence the 
situation in our country," Boris Yeltsin stressed. 
  The president considers that the intelligence service can 
also make a weighty contribution toward securing Russia's 
economic security. In its economic interests, he continued, it 
is much more important to guarantee free access to other 
countries' markets for goods and other Russian output. Boris 
Yeltsin is convinced that the resolution of this problem is an 
important task both for foreign policy and for the intelligence 
service. 
  Russia's president also named the uncovering of organized 
crime links with European and American criminal clans as an 
important task for the FIS. Partnership links with foreign 
secret services may play a useful role in combating 
international organized crime. The FIS, Boris Yeltsin stated, 
"has such powers and is able to use them, as we know."

  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- A meeting of the 
Presidential Council was held in Kremlin today to discuss ways 
and methods to achieve civic accord, the presidential press 
service reports. 
  The meeting noted that the adoption of the new Russian 
Constitution enabled more tranquil situation in the country and 
signing of the agreement on civic accord may become a new step 
towards civic peace. 
  An introductory speech of President Yeltsin stressed the 
importance of the current level of mutual understanding between 
the president, the government and the Federal Assembly. The 
Presidential Council members basically shared this point of view 
but called the president's attention to the fact the State Duma 
has not begun the fulfilment of its major task -- legislative 
renovation of Russia. 
  Speaking of acute Russian problems, council members urged 
the 
president to enhance consolidation of Russian statehood, 
including more tough measures against crime. Some members of 
the Presidential Council sharply criticized the procurator's 
office. 
  When commenting on economic issues, the meeting participants 
called attention to social dangers caused by the aggravated 
problem of non-payments and further production recession. 
  A number of council members expressed concern over the 
president's passiveness in encouragement of reforms.

  [Text] "Today we have the most corrupt government in the 
history of Russia," chairman of the State Duma committee on 
security Viktor Ilyukhin told a press conference on Tuesday (the 
Communist party faction). [sentence as received] In his words, 
"corruption is corroding the state apparatus." Ilyukhin 
believes that the most corrupt body is the Goskomimushchestvo 
(the State Property Committee), and that "the dock has long been 
waiting for" its chairman, vice-premier Anatoliy Chubays. 
  Ilyukhin said that at the beginning of the '80s, specialists 
estimate, 35 percent of stolen money was spent to bribe 
officials, now -- 50 percent and more. In 1993 150 major 
criminal organizations operated in Russia with more than 35,000 
enterprises within their spheres of influence. 4,500 case of 
bribery were registered. 
  Speaking about "financial subversion against Russia", 
Ilyukhin said that in 1993 4,300 crimes were disclosed in the 
banking system. All in all, 52,000 corruption-related crimes 
were registered last year. Cases against 1,500 officials were 
opened. In his opinion, "a totally criminalized economy may 
develop" in Russia. 
  Ilyukhin also said that the security committee had prepared 
a 
draft law on fighting corruption. On May 11 it will be 
submitted to a plenary session of the State Duma. He noted that 
a new provision in the draft law is that a state official should 
sign a document on his income, real estate and personal property 
worth over 100 minimal salaries, bank deposits and securities, 
financial obligations, including those abroad. 
  Referring to the Central Electoral Commission, Ilyukhin 
accused Russia's Choice faction and Yabloko faction that during 
the election campaign they used the money received from joint 
ventures in violation of the Russian president's decree. 
  He said that Russia's Choice had received more than 300 
million rubles from these joint ventures for holding the 
election campaign, and Yabloko -- more than 30 million rubles. 
  Answering an Interfax question Ilyukhin said that at the 
next 
meeting the council of the State Duma will consider this issue 
and will obviously put it on the agenda of a plenary meeting. 
Ilyukhin believes that the legality of deputy mandates of the 
above mentioned factions "should become a subject for 
investigation by the mandate commission of the State Duma."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The Federation Council of the 
Russian Federation has approved the Russian president's edict on 
a state of emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The 
chamber received the decree today and discussed it behind closed 
doors. 
  Valeriy Fateyev, chairman of the commission of deputies 
which 
worked in the zone of state of emergency, told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that the decree "amended the mistake made in the 
similar edict of 5 April, whereby four populated areas were 
excluded from the emergency zone." This resulted in a sharp 
aggravation of the crime situation in the area and victims. The 
president amended the edict in relation to the zone of state of 
emergency at the Federation Council's proposal. 
  The problem of the conflict, however, has not been solved, 
the deputy stressed, and the central authorities should change 
the forms of administration in that area. Fateyev and some 
other deputies are convinced that all executive power should 
rest with the federal center, that is the Russian president and 
a local body of power authorized by him, whereas representative 
bodies of power, whoever they belong to, should temporarily 
suspend their activity.

  [Text] [Announcer Vladimir Baburin] On Tuesday we received 
notice from the director of the Mosenergo joint-stock company 
that our most powerful radio transmitter had been switched off 
because of unpaid bills, which, our company, just like 
Ostankino, is unable to pay as the state does not finance its 
state TV and radio companies. True, this time the power workers 
switched off the knife switch because the communications 
industries have not been paying them, whom in turn the state has 
also not been paying. Our correspondent Vladimir Mishnev rang 
Anatoliy (Batyushkin), head of the Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Department of the Communications Ministry: 
  [Begin recording] [Mishnev] Please tell us who must pay 
those 
bills. 
  [(Batyushkin)] The communications enterprises. It has been 
decided to allocate funds for paying wages only to workers in 
communications enterprises for the first quarter. 
  [Mishnev] It must be said that you do not have the money to 
pay the power workers. 
  [(Batyushkin)] None at all. 
  [Mishnev] And in such a situation what will happen now? 
  [(Batyushkin)] Eventually there will be a natural withering 
away. 
  [Mishnev] Please tell us whether the Finance Ministry is 
contemplating paying the arrears. 
  [(Batyushkin)] The Finance Ministry says the following: 
Bring 
your broadcasting amount in accordance with the money that is 
being allocated under the budget. 
  [Mishnev] So, the possibility is not ruled out that other 
transmitters will also be switched off? 
  [(Batyushkin)] According to the results of work in the first 
quarter, the power workers should now have switched off 
virtually all TV and radio broadcasting. 
  [Mishnev] Who is to decide whether the transmitters are to 
work? 
  [(Batyushkin)] I believe only the government. [end 
recording] 
  [Baburin] So that for the umpteenth time the prospect of 
reviving the old tradition of table-talk is beginning to loom 
before us. After all, following the radio receivers, TV sets 
could also be switched off. So, get ready to entertain one 
another by retelling Santa Barbara parts you have already 
watched, the others you might just not see.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- During my travels 
through Yakutia I was convinced many times that the main wealth 
of your harsh land lay not in diamonds or gold, but in your 
inhabitants. This was stated in greetings from Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin to those taking part in the Assembly of Peoples of 
the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The once backward, distant, 
northern outpost of Russia was transformed by the persistent and 
concerted hard work of the Yakuts, Russians, and other peoples 
of Yakutia. 
  Today, under the difficult conditions of the transition 
period, economic progress and political stability in the 
republic depend to a great extent on prosperity in the ethnic 
relations sphere. Success may be achieved only by overcoming 
territorial and national egoism and by demonstrating self 
possession, calm, mutual respect, and responsibility for the 
fate of our united fatherland -- the Russian Federation. 
  Much has already been done toward creating conditions where 
there is a genuine equality of rights for the development of all 
of the peoples of Yakutia, the greetings state. Even more needs 
to be done. The small northern peoples -- the Evens, Evenkis, 
and Yukagirs demand particular concern from the republican 
authorities. 
  The president congratulated the multi-ethnic people of 
Yakutia on their Day of the Republic.

  [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin decreed to condemn political repressions agains 
representatives of the Yakutian people that were committed in 
the twenties and the thirties. 
  The presidential decree circulated on Wednesday, 
specifically, says: 
  In order to restore historic justice regarding 
representatives of the Yakutian people subjected to repressions 
in the autumn of 1927 in connection with the indictment on the 
case of the "Mladoyakut National Soviet Socialist Party of 
Medium and Poor Peasantry of Confederalists" and those subjected 
to repressions resulting from the resolution of the politburo of 
the central committee of the all- union communist party 
(bolshevik) on the situation in the Yakutian organisation of 
August 9, 1929, the president, in accordance with the 
conclusions of the presidential commissions of the Russian

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Sidorov under the "Frank Talk" rubric: </F>
"Where Does Our Strength Lie? Reflections on the Results of the 
Agrarian Party of Russia Central Council's Latest Plenum"] 
  [Text] The most pressing question at the plenum was the 
cadre question. Yes, the elections to the State Duma were a 
success, as were the elections to the local organs of 
self-government. But everyone understands perfectly that 
success, like lightning, never strikes in the same place twice. 
Thus Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of the Agrarian Party of Russia 
[APR], stated bluntly that without mass support the party would 
not get far. The time for rejoicing is over; it is time to get 
down to the routine donkeywork of creating primary party 
organizations. And the APR, alas, so far does not have a great 
number of them. In 20 of the 88 federation components the party 
has not yet been registered at all. 
  "Work -- there is heaps of it. But what is the mood like?" 
  "We need the Ministry of Agriculture structures to help us 
to 
create primary party organizations. Let there be a vertical 
chain of command, so that the chiefs of rayon agricultural 
administrations join the APR themselves and give orders to their 
subordinates..." 
  "It is very difficult to act on a voluntary basis. We need 
full-time organizers, funding... 
  It is very difficult to work in this area. In nine years 
many rural leaders of subdepartments and farms have been 
infected with greed. Without them it is difficult to create 
primary organizations on the spot." 
  I deliberately do not give the names of these people who 
proved themselves so helpless in the most important party task 
-- organization. This weakness is nowadays characteristic of 
all Russian parties. And the one which manages to cast aside 
ambitions and reliance on instructions from above the most 
quickly will win at the next elections and will continue to win 
thereafter. It is no accident that Aleksandr Zaveryukha, member 
of the APR Central Council, having heard his fill of the 
"valuable" conclusions cited above, said bluntly and angrily: 
"Our strength lies within ourselves." 
  You could not put it more accurately. One after another the 
Central Council members ascend the rostrum and say: 
  "An agrarian party without its own press organ is 
unthinkable. All its decisions, decrees, and ideas fail to reach 
rnak-and-file members. We must have our own news organ and seek 
links with the agrarian press." 
  As if this press is hiding from the agrarians. During the 
recess I tried to find out by degrees which Central Council 
member subscribes to which agrarian newspaper. I did not manage 
to find out. However much I searched while on assignments on 
the bare notice boards of agro-industrial complex trade union 
committees and rayon agricultural administrations and in offices 
-- I have nowhere seen an agrarian newspaper. The agrarian 
press is nowhere to be seen either in villages or in rayon 
centers, let alone oblast cities. So what is the sense in 
newspapers publishing information about the work of the APR, if 
no members of the party subscribe to them or read them?! Of 
course, the distribution of a newspaper once again requires 
effort and the loss of free time, and, when it comes down to it, 
money. But after all, there is no other way. 
  Party members, for example, must engage in propaganda. Like, 
shall we say, explaining to rural laborers the essence of the 
law on bankruptcy. At the plenum this law was rubbished by all 
but those who could not be bothered. But in his speech Vice 
Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha objected: 
  "We should know this law; after all, it says that a farm 
which declares itself bankrupt is to be given financial 
injections for two years in order for it to try to get back on 
its feet. Then it is given the right to voluntary flotation, 
and much else. It would be no bad thing for some farms to seize 
upon this law, rather than damn it...." 
  Boris Chernov from Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, speaking of the 
experience of land redistribution in his area, defined its 
results as a hopeless failure. But he said: 
  "To survive, we must work creatively." 
  But how can you work creatively, if many people do not read 
even the laws?! Of course, to reject them is far more simple. 
Yes, the reforms are punishingly difficult, but it is hight 
time to release that not everything in them is without rhyme or 
reason. Experienced rayon agricultural production leaders say 
that the time has come to study every farm individually, and if 
necessary, break them up into smaller units. Formerly it was 
possible to drive a tractor 20 kilometers to a field from the 
central farmstead for a few kopeks. Today this trip costs 
thousands. It was correctly observed (unfortunately, off the 
record) that we have not managed to forge an agrarian complex, 
and that, although being apparently of the same mind, each of us 
is in fact plowing his own furrow. All this should not only be 
known, but brought to the attention of the party rank and file, 
of the ordinary rural laborers. How is this to be done without 
funds, offices, or direct telephone links? It is the simplest 
thing in the world to dress up like a man of the people, as 
respectable Western congressmen do on the eve of the elections, 
and set off for remote villages and farms in order to help 
people, and your own party at the same time, in word and deed. 
Politics, like any other art, requires sacrifices. 
  Incidentally, about big-time politics. 
  A party which has in its ranks such cadres as State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, vice premier of the 
Russian Federation Government, APR Chairman Mikhail Lapshin, a 
highly experienced manager; Aleksandr Davydov, chairman of the 
Agro-Industrial Complex Employees Trade Union Central Committee, 
an able tactician and organizer; and many others, can only be 
envied. After all, it was only thanks to them that the party's 
Central Council did not in their majority commit a fateful 
mistake, and did after all give their consent to the signing of 
the well-known "Agreement on Accord and Peace," putting forward 
a number of very important prior conditions which would prevent 
the president and the government from implementing the previous 
policy of the virtual destruction of the agrarian sector of the 
Russian economy. 
  "We should not try to smash through walls where there are 
doors," Ivan Rybkin objected to his party comrades. "The 
agrarian faction is one of the most respected in the Duma. And 
we should do everything to bequeath to agrarians a firm 
legislative basis. We should learn the art of compromise." 
  The APR Central Council's plenum was a stormy affair, 
characterized by disputes and searches for the truth. One would 
like to hope that all the conclusions drawn during the 
discussions will serve as a reliable foundation for the 
construction of a true champion of agricultural workers -- the 
Agrarian Party of Russia.

  Orthodox people and nonbelievers, monarchists and supporters 
of other social systems, and politicians and representatives of 
social thought have gathered together, turning aside from 
private political tasks and personal interests. 
  "We have united with the aim of overcoming the idea 
instilled 
in the public awareness as to the apparent incompatibility of 
the revival of Russian national values based on Orthodox ethics 
and the idea of the legal and social development of society," 
Mikhail Astafyev, chairman of the new movement, said. 
  At a press conference it was noted that the demographic 
disaster which the Russian people are now experiencing means 
that within 50 years the country's population will be halved, 
and we will be able to talk of the historical end of Russia and 
an imminent geopolitical repartition of an enormous part of the 
world. 
  The center's tasks include striving to end the insulting 
plundering of national resources under the guise of monstrous, 
thieving forms of privatization. Crime, which is eating away at 
the economy, state structures, and the law enforcement organs, 
can be rooted out only by means of uncompromising emergency 
legislation.

<F P=106> [Yelena Uzbekova report under the "Party Organization" </F>
rubric: "One More Patriotic Movement Has Constituted Itself. 
`People's Alliance' Is `a Young and Powerful Party of the 
Ordinary People'"] 
  [Text] The constituent conference of the "People's 
Alliance" Russian patriotic movement, including such movements 
as the Russian Social Democratic Union [RSDU], "Smena-New 
Policy," and the "Soyuz" ["Union"] electoral club, was held on 
25 April. In the platform statement on the goals and objectives 
of the Russian patriotic movement, Sergey Glazyev and Andrey 
Golovin (former leader of "Smena-New Policy") pointed out that 
"People's Alliance" is "not a Moscow party of a mythical 
'majority,'" but "a young, powerful, and energetic organization 
of a political center. A party of the ordinary people, who are 
the linchpin of vast Russia." According to Dmitriy Olshanskiy, 
"People's Alliance" is a party in which all political structures 
capable of forming a coalition are interested. 
  The alliance leaders see their main objective as the 
unification of all patriotic forces. In their view, the great 
political potential of "People's Alliance" members will help the 
party to influence the way the country is governed, and to rule 
the state if it wins the next elections. The "People's 
Alliance's" program of political and economic reform in Russia 
confirms the seriousness of its founders' ambitions. 
  The conference approved the Russian patriotic movement's 
charter unanimously and without any amendments, just as they 
adopted a program statement, which was only required to be 
finalized by the political council. The conference also elected 
a political council made up of 14 members. Also unanimously, 
"People's Alliance" elected its cochairmen -- Andrey Golovin and 
Dmitriy Olshanskiy. 
  As stated at the conference, "People's Alliance" has already 
set up 10 regional branches. The constituent conference of the 
"People's Alliance" Russian Movement was scheduled for June.

  [Text] The Russian delegation is ready for negotiations 
with Chechnya and has the appropriate authority for this, Vice 
Premier Sergey Shakhray declared in his interview with Interfax. 
"Russia is going to hold the negotiations without any ultimatums 
or preliminary conditions but with a precise political 
position," he emphasized. 
  In his opinion, a single position with respect to Chechnya 
among Russia's supreme echelons of power is an important premise 
for a success. 
  As Shakhray underlined, "Moscow intends to hold 
consultations 
with all real political forces and power bodies in Chechnya and 
then to precisely fix a draft agreement on the division of 
authorities and the subject of these consultations, then it 
intends to start negotiations and preparation of a draft 
agreement just after the State Duma adopts a corresponding 
decision." Shakhray said that it will be necessary to sign the 
agreement only after democratic free elections in Chechnya. 
  Russia will use a similar mechanism as that used with 
Tatarstan to achieve agreement at the negotiations. To quote 
Shakhray that mechanism was "when we first of all searched for 
concrete authorities in various spheres, in transport, oil 
processing, agrarian sector, border defense, etc., and then 
included the reached agreements into a political formula on 
relations."

<F P=106> [Viktor Trushkov report: "Assent to...Dictatorship? </F>
Russian Federation Former General Prosecutor A. Kazannik Warns 
That Russia Is Threatened by a Regime of Personal Power"] 
  [Text] Sergey Filatov has played a deadly trump card 
against any ill-wishers. The head of the presidential 
administration bombastically pronounced: "No power which seeks 
dictatorship will bother about accord in society." It turned 
out a ringing phrase, but.... The ideal option for a dictator 
is one whereby he secures assent to dictatorship. 
  But why did the president's trusty henchman suddenly start 
speaking about dictatorship just before the signing of the 
"Social Accord Contract"? Because the closer the "fateful" date 
comes, the more acutely the question arises: Who is to agree 
with whom? PRAVDA has already advanced the assumption that it is 
a pact between mice and the cat which is chasing them. But 
Aleksey Kazannik, Russian Federation former general prosecutor, 
has made a still more definite assessment of the situation: 
Overt dictatorship is approaching in Russia. He declared this 
at the height of the talk of civil peace and social accord. 
Here is a dictaphone recording of his reply to the 
"Novosti-plyus" television program: 
  "I believe that you do not have to have the wisdom of 
Solomon 
but simply analyze the state of the president's team and the 
dynamics of its development in order to arrive at definite 
conclusions. The first such reason is that the president's 
whole team, so I have become convinced, has been formed not 
according to professional and personal qualities but only on 
principles of personal devotion. Therefore these people are 
essentially privy to a compact or, if you like, even a 
conspiracy. 
  "Second reason: Since these people have been selected on 
such principles, it goes without saying that a certain stable 
grouping has taken shape. They were closely welded together -- 
I would even say fused together -- by the blood of the events of 
October 1993. These people really are as thick as thieves. 
  "Third: I have become convinced that the bulk of these 
people are professionally incompetent. They cannot work with 
their head and evidently consider it shameful to work with their 
hands. Therefore they hold on to the president, as bus 
passengers hold on to the handrails to stop themselves falling. 
  "Fourth, the president has already subordinated to himself 
all the power structures -- the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Security 
Administration, the Ministry of Defense, a number of other 
services.... 
  "The president and his entourage frequently violate the 
Constitution, laws, and State Duma and Federation Council 
decrees. All these factors taken together have enabled me to 
conclude that overt dictatorship is approaching." 
  The warning is so serious that it must make any politician 
think before he ventures to sign a document which openly 
curtails citizens' democratic rights and restricts the operation 
of the Constitution. But Russians had already guessed that 
which Professor A. Kazannik has proved in a logical and well 
reasoned manner. As public opinion poll data attest, only 
one-fifth of our fellow citizens believe that Russia is governed 
by democrats, while more than half of those polled are sure that 
there is now undemocratic administration of the country. 
  Incidentally, in an attempt to refute the ex-prosecutor's 
statement the head of the Russian Federation president's 
administration has virtually...confirmed it. First, S. Filatov 
admitted that "the presidential team is selected by the 
president, who proceeds, inter alia, from personal likes." 
Second, he confirmed that "the power structures were under the 
president before the events, and they are under the president 
now." 
  So what is the presidential team imposing on the country -- 
social accord or assent to...dictatorship?

<F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina report: "`Working Russia' Movement. </F>
Wages for the Workers, and the Sack for the Bureaucrats"] 
  [Text] About 200 delegates from 37 oblasts, 6 republics, 
and 2 krays, as well as 175 delegates of the "Working Capital" 
congress from Moscow and the Moscow region, participated in the 
Second Congress of the "Working Russia" All-Russia 
Sociopolitical Movement, which took place 23 April in the city 
of Reutovo, Moscow Oblast. Viktor Anpilov's report "On the 
Socioeconomic Situation in Russia," the coreports by well-known 
scientists Boris Khorev and Aleksey Sergeyev, and the delegates' 
speeches noted that further enforced capitalization of the 
country will exacerbate the crisis, compound the already 
desperate situation in which the workers find themselves, and 
turn Russia into a colony of the developed capitalist countries. 
  The congress expressed an unequivocal view: Only a complete 
change of the country's political and economic policy and the 
restoration of workers' power from top to bottom in the shape of 
soviets will extricate society from the crisis. 
  "Working Russia" has always been against private property 
and 
the implementation of the predatory privatization program which 
has brought poverty, unemployment, and social inequality to the 
majority of the working people. Each increase in the percentage 
of the country's unemployed should be matched by an identical 
reduction in Russia's administrative apparatus, which has 
increased greatly and exceeds the number of administrators in 
the whole of the Soviet Union's structures, the delegates said. 
Another slogan which was ardently supported was: "Wages for 
the workers, the sack for the president and the bureaucrats!" 
  The congress adopted a package of documents, having 
confirmed 
its policy to organize a general political strike in Russia. 
Advocating peace and stability in society, the delegates 
demanded that the powers that be respect existing laws and that 
President Yeltsin be dismissed immediately. A public committee 
to investigate the tragedy of 3-4 October was formed and Russian 
People's Deputy Yuriy Slobodkin will head it. 
  The congress supported the "Working Capital's" decision to 
nominate Viktor Anpilov as a Russian presidential candidate. 
Anpilov himself is categorically against the institution of the 
presidency which is incompatible with true democracy, and is 
joining the battle for the post of president with the sole aim 
of abolishing the institution of the presidency which is hateful 
to the people and bringing back the soviets of working people as 
his very first act if he is elected. 
  Oleg Shenin, chairman of the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU 
Council Political Executive Committee; Timo Lahdenmaeki, 
chairman of the Finnish Communist Workers Party; Eric Trevet, 
general secretary of the new Communist Party of England; 
Yeoryios Mavrikos, member of the Communist Party of Greece 
Central Committee, Sergio Rubens, member of the Brazilian "8 
October" Revolutionary Movement Coordination Committee; Bill 
Doris, member of the U.S. Workers' World Party Central 
Committee; and others ardently welcomed "Working Russia's" 
heroic struggle to resurrect the Soviet Union, socialism, and 
Soviet power. 
  "Working Russia" called on all working people to hold a May 
Day demonstration under the slogans: "Authorities Without 
Criminals," "Life Without Speculators," "Stable Prices," and 
"Unity of the USSR's Peoples."

  [Text] The Russian Government has decreed to hold in 1999 
an all-Russia census. The need for such a count has arisen 
owing to the country's deteriorating demographic situation 
(climbing death rate, and so on), as well as to the increased 
number of refugees and the homeless. Proceeding from the 
census' results the government is going to draw up some specific 
plans to improve the living in the country.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- A mechanism of state protectionism 
and other problems of the mass information media is the main 
topic of the two-day conference of editors of Russia's national 
and regional newspapers, which opened at the Russian Committee 
for the Press today. Participants are to examine a number of 
draft laws related, inter alia, to preferential taxation of the 
media. 
  The press' economic situation is a political issue, said 
Boris Mironov, chairman of the committee, opening the 
conference. He explained the great importance of the presence 
of a large number of regional representatives at this "briefing" 
by the fact that it is precisely the Russian province that 
becomes the center of economic reforms today. Mironov spoke 
about obstacles in the way toward adopting a decision on state 
protectionism of the press. Thus, leaders of the Economics 
Ministry and the Finance Ministry claim that this document will 
create "a dangerous precedent." 
  Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for 
Information Policy and Communications spoke about the 
committee's work. He asked to back the committee in adopting a 
law that forbids any power structures setting up mass 
information media. 
  This time "the top statesmen" showed unprecedented attention 
to "the fourth estate." Today, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of 
the Russian Government, will meet participants in the conference 
at the White House. This will be his first meeting with 
representatives of the regional press. Also, Vladimir Shumeyko, 
Anatoliy Chubays, and Vyacheslav Kostikov are expected to 
address the conference.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondentr Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin made a decision and issue directives on a 
state subsidy of 110,400 million roubles to Russian newspapers 
before the end of 1994. This decision was adopted at the prime 
minister's meeting with a large group of editors of national and 
regional newspapers on Tuesday afternoon, Valentin Sergeyev, 
chief of the press office of the Russian Government, told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  It was also agreed at the meeting that the distribution of 
state subsidies will be made by a public council formed of heads 
of central and local media at the Russian committee on the press. 
  During the meeting there was a thorough discussion of the 
situation and problems of the central and regional press, the 
need for financial support for most publications, particularly 
in the economically weak regions, Sergeyev said. The 
fundamental provisions of the draft Russian law on state 
protection for the media were also discussed. Chernomyrdin 
described to chief editors in detail the economic situation in 
the country and the government's cardinal measures for economic 
stabilisation. 
  Commenting on the results of the meeting, Sergeyev said he 
believes that during the conversation chief editors received the 
maximum of information they need in their daily work and for 
grasping the actual situation in the country. This enabled them 
to revise the viewpoint about the alleged lack of understanding 
in the government for problems of the press. "I believe editors 
got convinced that the goverment regards the press not only as 
the `fourth power' but also as branch number one, the situation 
in which should always be given close attention", Sergeyev said.

"`Gazprom' Up for Grabs at Auction. Check Investment Funds To 
Be Banned From Taking Part in the Privatization of Russia's 
Largest Company"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federal Property Fund has announced the 
commencement of accepting applications to take part in a check 
auction to sell the Gazprom Russian joint-stock company. The 
applications will be accepted from 25 April to 1 May. 
  At yesterday's press conference devoted to the event, State 
Property Committee Chairman Anatoliy Chubays called the 
privatization of Gazprom "an absolutely unprecedented event," 
because, according to his estimates, the auction will absorb at 
least 20 million privatization checks, that is, at least 13 
percent of their total number. Some 40 percent of Gazprom's 
total number of shares will be kept by the state for three 
years. Around 34 percent of the stock will be offered for sale 
at check auctions; 10 percent will be bought by Gazprom at face 
value; 15 percent will be sold under closed subscription to the 
Gazprom joint-stock company's workers collectives; and the 
remaining around 1 percent of shares will be owned by the 
"Rosstroygazifikatsiya" gas distribution company. A noteworthy 
feature of the company's privatization is that around one-fourth 
of all shares will be sold in Tyumen Oblast. The shares of other 
Russian oblasts range from 1 to 4 percent. 
  The State Property Committee chairman pointed out in the 
press conference that check investment funds will be banned from 
taking part in the check auction to sell Gazprom stock, because, 
Anatoliy Chubays stressed, there are plenty of other attractive 
targets for the funds' activity. Regarding the possible 
profitability of Gazprom stock and possible dividends for future 
shareholders, Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of the company's board, 
said that he did not expect large percentages, because the 
shareholders' main advantage would be the growth in the shares' 
market value.

  [Text] Moscow April 27 Tass -- Foreign investments in 
Russia will not be liable to a 23 per cent tax, Russian Acting 
Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told Business-Tass on Wednesday. 
  "Foreign investments in the form of finances allocated to 
joint ventures created on the Russian territory or in the form 
of payment by foreign legal entities and private individuals for 
acquired securities of Russian enterprises, as well as loans and 
credits granted by foreign banks and credit institutions should 
not be liable to the value added (20 per cent) tax and the 
special (3 per cent) tax", Dubinin said in an official statement. 
  "Not subject to taxation are finances granted on a free 
basis 
by foreign states to Russian enterprises and organisations in 
the form of subsidies for implementing goal-oriented 
programmes", he added. 
  According to acting legislation, the turnover taxable by VAT 
and the special tax includes finances received from other 
enterprises and organisations, Dubinin said adding that excluded 
from them are contributions by founders to the authorized 
capital and sums used for joint activities. Free from VAT and 
the special tax are transactions on issuing and transferring 
loans, as well as operations connected with the circulation of 
securities (shares, bonds, certificates, bills of exchange, 
etc), according to the minister.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "In Brief" column: "The </F>
Agro-Industrial Complex Resists Zaveryukha"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government intends to "intensify this 
year the reformation of agricultural enterprises and elaborate 
procedures for their bankruptcy." This was announced to 
INTERFAX by Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha. 
  According to him, agricultural production in the country's 
agrarian sector has fallen 13 percent in the first quarter of 
this year, and "it has proved impossible so far" to stabilize 
it. More than 30 percent of kolkhozes and sovkhozes, 
joint-stock companies, and other collective agricultural 
enterprises, according to the vice premier, "are not earning 
enough even to pay their employees." 
  At the same time, A. Zaveryukha noted, any attempt by the 
government "not even to recommend but simply approve a 
particular approach to reform -- be that the Nizhniy Novgorod or 
Moscow option of disaggregation [razukrupneniye]" -- meets with 
resistance from agro-industrial complex leaders.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report under the "Fiscal Matters" rubric: </F>
"Taxes Will Not Be Cut in Russia Until Economy Becomes 
Economical"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry [CCI] will hold a series of "roundtables" this week to 
discuss tax legislation and possible ways of reforming it. 
Yesterday, chiefs of enterprises, unions, and associations of 
entrepreneurs who assembled at the CCI congress center had a 
chance to learn the government's view on this burning question. 
  Even earlier, the CCI information-analytical service 
conducted a poll among its 4,000 members on whether the 
government's taxation policy helps to boost production. A total 
of 96 percent of those polled said "No." Bending to the 
sentiments of the Chamber's members, CCI specialists have drawn 
up draft amendments to the current taxation system. Describing 
the current taxation system as unwieldy and inefficient because 
it gives rise to unbearable tax pressure, the specialists have 
suggested that taxation be adjusted so as to bring it in line 
with world prices -- the number of taxes, duties, and payments 
should be cut by merging them, and upper limits for profit tax 
rates should be established at 30-35 percent and 15-20 percent 
for small businesses. 
  Meanwhile, Aleksandr Ivaneyev, chief of the Finance Ministry 
taxation reform department, who also spoke at the meeting, said 
that the Finance Ministry categorically opposes any revision of 
the taxation system. "Until the state cuts budget expenditures, 
any reduction in the tax burden is out of the question," the 
Finance Ministry's representative explained to interested 
businessmen. 
  According to Mr. Ivaneyev, the current tax legislation is in 
perfect conformity with the country's economic situation. Mr. 
Ivaneyev conceded that taxes do not play as important a role in 
economic regulation as they do in developed countries, and a 
reduction, say, in value-added tax will not spark production 
growth. The main regulator is still the tax of inflation. 
  "The state's grabbing reflex has not weakened yet," was how 
Ivan Kivelidi, chairman of the Russian Federation Government's 
Council on Entrepreneurship, summed up the Finance Ministry's 
stance. In Kivelidi's view, fiscal policy will prompt the 
conversion of money into cash and the across-the-board 
criminalization of entrepreneurial activity.

<F P=106> [Decree No. 344 of the Russian Federation Government "On </F>
State Commodity Bonds," dated 16 April 1994, Moscow and signed 
by Russian Federation Government Chairman V. Chernomyrdin] 
  [Text] In order to liquidate state commodity bonds and 
prevent a further increase in what the state owes in 
compensation for commodity price differences, the Russian 
Federation government decrees that: 
  1. The Russian Federation Finance Ministry is to: 
  buy up, if the owners so wish, specific interest-free 1990 
state loan bonds for particular home-produced consumer goods 
(aside from cars) at existing consumer prices, and, in the case 
of cars, at 60 percent of the price. 
  Bonds will be bought primarily from invalids and veterans of 
the Great Patriotic War and from invalids of the armed forces; 
  buy up checks for the specific purpose of acquiring motor 
vehicles, issued before 2 January 1992 and entitling the holder 
to obtain a vehicle in 1992, and "Harvest-90" checks -- at a 
price that is 70 times the face value of the check, with the 
money being paid into bank deposits; 
  index the residue of specific deposits for the acquisition 
of 
cars as of 1 January 1992, multiplying by a factor of 70. 
  The aforementoned checks are to be bought up and deposits 
are 
to be indexed for all owners, irrespective of the specified 
place for acquiring the cars; 
  pay back to suppliers of agricultural products from the 1991 
harvest, who sold grain, oil seeds, potatoes and vegetables on 
terms envisaged by the 17 July 1991 RSFSR Council of Ministers 
decree No. 403 "On Measures To Implement the 8 July 1991 
Directive No. 1554-1 of the Chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet 
and Chairman of the RSFSR Council of Ministers `On Additional 
Measures To Establish State Grain and Other Food Resources in 
1991,'" money owing on bonds through the payment of financial 
compensation amounting to 70 times the price of the commodity 
before 2 January 1992. 
  2. Carry out the measures mentioned in point 1 of this 
decree during the period from 15 June 1994 and 1 June 1995 on 
the basis of federal budget funds allocated for this purpose in 
1994-1995. 
  3. It is to be laid down that the following owners of 
specific interest-free 1990 state loan bonds are entitled to 
financial compensation: 
  Russian Federation citizens living on the territory of 
Russia 
and outside it; 
  individuals living on the territory of the Russian 
Federation 
and deemed to be enforced migrants or refugees, irrespective of 
where the bonds were acquired. 
  4. The Russian Federation Finance Ministry, Russian 
Federation Economics Ministry, and Russian Federation State 
Committee for Statistics are to present to the Russian 
Federation Savings Bank before 1 June 1994 set consumer prices 
for consumer goods, as envisaged by the 21 December 1989 USSR 
Council of Ministers decree No. 1119 "On the Issuing of Specific 
Interest-free State Loans" (except car prices). 
  5. The proposal by the "AvtoVAZ" joint-stock company that 
specific interest-free 1990 state loan bonds for cars be 
exchanged for that joint-stock company's bonds put into 
circulation on 9 June 1993 is to be accepted. 
  The Russian Federation Finance Ministry is to: 
  Buy from the "AvtoVAZ" joint-stock company, if necessary, 
bonds issued by it at prices agreed with it; 
  exchange the "AvtoVAZ" joint-stock company bonds for 
specific 
interest-free 1990 state loans, on the basis of the amount of 
compensation indicated in point 1 of the present decree, with 
the owners of the 1990 bonds paying the extra to make up the 
price of the aforementioned joint-stock company bond. 
  6. The Russian Federation Finance Ministry is to: 
  conclude agreements with the Russian Federation Savings Bank 
and other banks to be determined by the Russian Federation 
Finance Ministry on buying up, liquidating, and indexing 
commodity bonds in accordance with the present decree; 
  join the Russian Federation Savings Bank in devising and 
approving the procedure for buying up and liquidating commodity 
bonds; 
  determine the mechanism for the exchange of specific 
interest-free 1990 state bonds for "AvtoVAZ" joint-stock company 
bonds. 
  V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation 
Government.

  [Text] Vladivostok April 27 TASS -- Arms will be used now 
to hit unidentified people without a warning when they attempt 
to penetrate into the grounds of military units, ships or other 
facilities of the Pacific Fleet. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from the press service of the Pacific Fleet 
that such orders were given on Wednesday by fleet Commander 
Georgiy Gurinov. This extraordinary measure was prompted by the 
heinous murder of Major A. Tedeyev, officer-on-duty at a 
military unit, in Vladivostok on Tuesday. 
  The terrorist act was committed by unidentified people at 
night. Several days before this accident, a group also of 
unidentified people attempted to capture one of the fleet's 
munitions depot. 
  In the opinion of the Pacific Fleet commander, only extreme 
measures can now stop brazen criminals.

  [Text] Flight Control Center, 26 Apr -- The flight of the 
orbiting Mir station, manned by cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev, 
Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov, is continuing. 
  During the last two days the scientific section of the 
crew's 
program has included astrophysical and technical experiments, as 
well as medical check-ups. 
  X-rays and gamma-radiation of extraterrestrial origin was 
measured by means of instruments mounted on the outside of the 
space station. Experiments to evaluate the condition of 
radioelectronic equipment, which has been exposed to the 
conditions of open space for a long time, were also carried out. 
  The cosmonauts underwent routine medical checks, including 
clinical analysis of blood samples. 
  In accordance with the timetable for routine preventive 
maintenance the crew will today replace coolant in the internal 
circuit of the Kvant-2 module's heat regulation system. 
  According to reports from orbit and telemetric data the 
flight is proceeding normally.

  [Text] Once again there are pickets outside the government 
building in Moscow. This time it is defense sector workers who 
are picketing. 
  [Correspondent Dmitriy Matyushkin] Once again there are 
tanks 
outside the White House, but this time they are only toy ones. 
As you can see, conversion is fully under way. However, 
without state support, defense enterprises have fallen into 
debt. Defense sector workers set up a picket today outside the 
White House. They were demanding that, taking account of 
inflation, the debt to defense sector enterprises for fulfilled 
state orders be settled, that the amount of nontaxable spending 
on pay be increased, and also that enterprises be compensated 
for losses relating to conversion. 
  According to the statistics of the defense sector unions, on 
1 April, the Ministry of Defense's arrears in paying for state 
orders was 154 billion rubles. Payment of wages is often 
delayed for three months. Lastly, the cash-flow problem of 
defense enterprises has virtually brought whole towns and works 
to a halt. Representatives of defense industry unions have 
accused the government primarily of not fulfilling the 
obligations of an agreement between sectors. In their view, the 
majority of specific proposals for stabilizing the sector have 
had no response.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The goal of the command and 
staff "north-west" war games, which began on Monday in Russia's 
Kalinigrad region and the Leningrad military district, is to 
perfect the ability of command and staff officers to direct 
their units. ITAR-TASS was told by the Defence Ministry's press 
bureau that the exercises, run by Russian Chief of General Staff 
Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, will last until April 29. 
  According to military sources, the exercises are meant to 
check the military capabilities of the troops stationed in the 
Kaliningrad region in particular. Earlier, those troops had 
"powerful back-up in the rear, but have now ended up surrounded 
by states whose policies concerning Russia are not always 
clear", the source said. 
  This spring is full of army and naval training exercises. 
Large- scale tactical maneuvers were held in Tajikistan. The 
"Pomor-94" naval exercises were held in the Barents Sea, and 
Russian-American- Canadian "Arctic-Sarex" war games were held in 
Alaska. Eastern Siberia was host to the "Baykal" command and 
staff exercises. Over- all, by the end of 1994 will have been 
held three exercise programmes for the strategic nuclear forces 
and more than ten in the operational and tactical fields. 
  Such an intense schedule of military exercises is designed, 
according to Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, "to maintain the 
battle-readiness of the Army and the power of the Navy, and to 
further develop the coordination of the commanding staff and 
troops, especially those that have been withdrawn from abroad 
back onto Russian territory".

  [Text] Yerevan, 26 April (SNARK) -- The Armenian parliament 
deputy, Ashot Bleyan, appeared in the Supreme Council with a 
statement charging the authorities in conduction of "undeclared 
war." He claimed that nearly 15 thousand Armenians became the 
victims of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. " Only during the last 
three or four months more than one thousand Armenian youths were 
killed", announced the deputy. 
  Bleyan's indignant colleagues did not let him finish the 
appearance, blaming him of lie, so that the speaker had to 
interrupt the session. 
  Ashot Bleyan, known for his pacifist position, has abandoned 
two years ago the ruling party -- the Armenian National Movement 
-- and founded a new social-policy organization " New Way", 
whose non-numerous followers appear for the immediate compromise 
solution of Nagorno-Karabakh problem. Nearly a year and a half 
ago, this deputy visited Baku, which caused a non-unanimous 
reaction in Armenia. 
  Being a professional teacher, Bleyan is known also as a 
director of advanced educational center in Yerevan, "Mekhitar 
Sebastatsi."

<F P=106> [Article by Ashot Gazazyan: "The President of Azerbaijan </F>
Proposes To Immediately Vacate Seven Rayons and One City"] 
  [Text] Information agencies have brought stunning news: It 
turns out that Baku does not rule out the possibility of a 
Russian plan intended to settle the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh 
and eliminate the consequences having been produced...in 
Yerevan. This assessment of Russia's new peacemaking initiative 
confirms the traditionally established idea that Azerbaijan is 
not even thinking about winding down combat actions and indeed 
is placing its bets on crude force. 
  Meanwhile, let us recall that the Russian plan calls for 
discontinuing combat actions in the conflict zone, vacating 
Azerbaijani territories, and allowing refugees to return. Moscow 
proposes to disengage the conflicting parties within three days 
after a cease-fire and to spend an equal amount of time 
establishing a buffer zone where international observers are 
expected to be located. Ultimately the blockade of Armenia would 
be broken, Karabakh would finally get relatively stable security 
guarantees, and Azerbaijan would get back its territories seized 
by the Karabakh Defense Army solely in order to ensure the 
security of its lines and the civilian population. 
  However, even this did not satisfy the politicians from 
Baku. 
They have now recalled that...Shusha also is among the 
"occupied" territories--incidentally, it is a city that is an 
inalienable part of Nagorno-Karabakh. If we adhere to the logic 
of G. Aliyev, we may also hear very soon that, for example, 
Mardakert is not mentioned in the Russians' plan.... As far as 
Lachin is concerned, according to Aliyev, it has also been 
"completely left out" of the new Russian plan. That is to say, 
the Lachin humanitarian corridor, Nagorno- Karabakh's only 
outlet to the outside world, should also be vacated by "Armenian 
formations." Thereafter, one would expect that Azeri soldiers 
will only have to conduct the last military operation in order 
to once again occupy the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, in its 
turn, and bring the population to its knees. It is hard to say 
whether these conditions of Baku are a ploy or complete lack of 
acceptance of existing realities, most likely caused by the 
quite understandable desire of the Azerbaijani leader to not 
share the fate of previous presidents of the state.... Be that 
as it may, Baku's reluctance to accept the world as it now is 
will not bring either Azerbaijan or the region as a whole more 
peace. 
  President Aliyev invited people from Karabakh to visit 
Baku--this is yet another sensation of recent days. In the 
process he made it clearly understood that those invited are 
citizens of Azerbaijan, and must engage in dialogue with Aliyev 
in the capital city in a way befitting people speaking with the 
president. It is hard to understand why the leaders of Karabakh 
must set out for Baku for anything at all. Clearly they might as 
well engage in "constructive" dialogue with, for example, the 
leaders of Kyrgyzstan or Sweden. The list could be continued.... 
  Yet another proposal by Aliyev confirms yet again that there 
are no political forces in Baku capable of evaluating the real 
situation in the region soberly; this means that a new 
escalation of combat actions should be expected, naturally, with 
all the peacemaking efforts, and not just those of Russia, being 
completely ignored. It is hard to say how much longer Baku will 
be able to play a duet alone, thus misleading the world 
community. One thing is obvious: Whatever the array of forces, 
Nagorno-Karabakh will never again be a protectorate of 
Azerbaijan. If a few more weapons emplacements of the aggressor 
need to be suppressed in order to ensure the security of the 
people of Karabakh, they have the means to accomplish this and 
support for these actions from commonly accepted norms of 
international law. If a weapons emplacement threatens the 
security of the population, it can be suppressed. This begs the 
following resume: If mistakes are not perceived today, their 
number may triple tomorrow. One cannot ride a tank or fly a 
bomber to peace and welfare in the region. If only all the sides 
understood this....

  [Text] As has already been reported, the Armenian 
Government has launched an initiative proposing the introduction 
of a new single currency within the framework of the economic 
union of the CIS countries, similar to the EU's ECU [European 
currency unit]. 
  With this in mind, Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan 
sent letters to the prime ministers of the CIS countries today, 
noting that the existence of the decades of unified system over 
the territory of the former Soviet Union is making the 
independent economic development of the CIS countries impossible 
without painful consequences. 
  The Armenian prime minister reminded his CIS colleagues that 
since the introduction of the national currencies in these 
countries, the financial transactions between them has been 
considerably difficult. The Russian ruble has become the means 
of payment for any trade transaction with the result that these 
states are appealing to Russia for additional credits to settle 
accounts between them. In this way, they are contributing to 
the Russian budget deficit. In its turn, the devaluation of the 
Russian ruble is causing even further devaluation of the 
national currencies. 
  The Armenian Government sees the mitigation of the financial 
difficulties in the wider use of the national currencies and 
therefore proposes the creation of a single CIS currency to 
settle the mutual accounts through a CIS interstate bank. This 
will broaden the opportunities of using the national currencies, 
assist in their stabilization, and establish exchange rates 
between them as eventually the interstate obligations will be 
regulated through the national currencies. This will make it 
possible to spare the CIS countries from accruing debts to 
Russia, alleviate Russia's credit problems, and contribute to 
the stabilization of the Russian ruble. 
  In the opinion of the Armenian Government, the creation of 
an 
interstate bank will be beneficial for all the CIS countries. 
Therefore, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan has called on all his 
colleagues to defend the idea of the creation of such a bank. 
  In his letter, Grant Bagratyan also detailed his views on 
how 
to set up the bank and form its initial capital.

  [Text] Yerevan, 26 April (SNARK) -- Armenian 
parliamentaries expressed today their resentment with appearance 
of deputy Ashot Bleyan, who claimed that Armenia conducts 
"undeclared war" and that nearly 15 thousand Armenians became 
the victims of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
  As told the speaker of the Armenian parliament, Babken 
Ararktsyan, immediately after Bleyan's appearance numerous calls 
started to come from Karabakh and Armenian combat divisions in 
which indignance was expressed with Bleyan's statements. "Such 
claims affect the national interests of Armenia," observed 
Ararktsyan. 
  A deputy from Nagorno-Karabakh, Roles Aghadzhanyan, called 
Bleyan's statement provocative. He acknowledged that there are 
volunteers from Armenia fighting in Karabakh. "However there are 
no Armenian troops in Karabakh," said Aghadzhanyan. 
  At the same time, the chairman of external relations 
committee David Vardanyan reminded that Bleyan is free to 
express his viewpoint. "I do not share his position, however the 
deputy cannot become a persecution object," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent on President Geydar </F>
Aliyev's meeting with the CSCE delegation in Baku on 27 April-- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In receiving the CSCE Minsk Group delegation, 
which is working to resolve the Karabakh conflict that has 
turned our Republic into a battlefield, the Azerbaijani 
president hoped that these contacts would produce positive 
results. 
  Mathias Mosberg, head of the delegation of diplomats and 
officers from seven countries, noted that during the meeting 
with the Azerbaijani president a month ago a delegation lead by 
Mr. Jan Eliasson [chairman of the Minsk Group] received 
favorable impressions and briefed the Azerbaijani president on 
their efforts to achieve a political resolution of the conflict. 
Mr. Mosberg informed him that the Prague conference prepared a 
number of packages on this matter. He said that two packages 
could be implemented before the cease-fire and another two after 
the cease-fire, and that the present delegation intends to 
discuss this plan with the Azerbaijani president. [passage 
omitted] 
  In thanking Aliyev for the frank talk, Mr. Mosberg said that 
the most important thing to them was to hear the Azerbaijani 
president's full support for the cease-fire. He said the CSCE 
Minsk Group will do everything it can on this subject. 
  Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov and State Minister on Foreign 
Affairs Vafa Gulizade were also present at the talks.

today on the Karabakh front. It was reported to an ARMENPRES 
correspondent at the headquarters of the Army of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh defense force that Azerbaijani subunits have 
been attacking in the Martuni and Fizuli directions since the 
morning. However, it notes in the report, the fierce fighting 
backed up by tanks did not bring the attackers success. Just as 
before, the Karabakh fighters are in control of their positions 
and are rebuffing the enemy onslaught. 
  The situation in the northeast of the confrontation sector, 
where some of Azerbaijan's firing positions were neutralized 
yesterday, was calm.

  [Text] Baku, 26 April (AZERTAC)--The Armenian Armed Forces 
do not renounce their attempts to continue attack on Agdamskiy, 
Terterskiy and Geranboyskiy [Rayons]. According to the 
Azerbaijani Defence Ministry, the Armenians have failed to break 
through the Azerbaijani defences in Terterskiy and are shelling 
settlement of the district. 
  The Defence Ministry has informed that, since yesterday, the 
Azerbaijani Armed Forces have repulsed five attacks of the 
Armenian Army. Failed in their last attempt to attack the 
Azerbaijani defences, the Armenians opened fire on their 
soldiers, who tried to flee the battlefield. 25 Armenian 
soldiers were killed by Armenians. However such an extreme 
measure has not helped to avoid the flight of its soldiers from 
the battlefield and to continue the offensive.

  [Text] Baku (April 26) TURAN -- Yesterday the Chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Rasul Guliyev, met with 
Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev. 
  During the meeting they discussed issues of mutual interest. 
  Rasul Guliyev mentioned that the primary pre-conditions for 
the development of Russian-Azerbaijani relations must be a 
cease-fire on the territory of Azerbaijan. 
  He said that the war has taken thousands of lives of both 
parties. That is why Russia must use its influence to settle 
the issue. 
  Andrey Kozyrev called the conflict "a common pain" and said 
that they will use all possible means to settle the conflict. 
  The Russian Foreign Minister assessed the settlement plan as 
a realistic document which is of mutual interest. 
  As far as the stationing of peacemaking forces of the CIS in 
the zone of the conflict is concerned, Kozyrev said that "it 
does not mean a constant presence of Russian troops in the 
region." 
  Rasul Guliyev's visit will end on 29 April. He is due to 
meet with the Chairman of Federal Session Meeting and the 
Russian Duma, the Russian Foreign Minister and Armenia's 
representatives.

  [Text] The Karabakh Defense Army's headquarters stated that 
Baku had accepted the plan for attaining cease-fire in the zone 
of the Karabakh conflict, proposed by Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev, because the Azerbaijani units were in disarray 
all along the front, informed sources in Stepanakert told 
INTERFAX. 
  The headquarters believe that Azerbaijan will make use of 
the 
cease-fire agreement for replenishing its forces and launching a 
new large-scale offensive. However, the final say on the truce 
is to be said by the Karabakh political leaders, whose official 
position is to be announced within the next few hours. 
  Grachev's cease-fire plan, proposed during the talks in 
Moscow with Azerbaijani parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, was 
supported by Azerbaijan. 
  On the same day, Grachev got in touch with Armenian 
President 
Levon Ter-Petrosian and, to quote the Armenian president's aid 
Levon Zurabian, asked him to influence Karabakh. 
  Zurabian said that Armenia could not accept or reject the 
reached agreement, because the conflict had to do with 
Azerbaijan and Nagorny Karabakh, and that Armenia could only use 
its influence. "The final decision must be taken by Nagorny 
Karabakh," he said.

<F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report under the "Diplomacy" rubric: </F>
"Russian Peacekeeping Is Not for Baku. Ankara Is Still Against 
Equal Responsibility Principle"] 
  [Excerpt] Parliamentary hearings held in Baku 22 April 
were devoted to a discussion of a new variant of the Russian 
plan for a peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan 
conflict. Although no final decision on the question being 
discussed was made, the view of the majority of parliamentarians 
was one: the document presented by Russia does not defend the 
sovereign rights of Azerbaijan while, as one of the speakers 
stated, "it actually reserves for the Armenian side the right to 
continue the occupation of more than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's 
territory." It is well known that should the Russian plan be 
approved, the Azeri Army would have to retreat 10 to 20 km from 
currently held positions, which would then mean leaving 35 
percent of the country's territory out of the Azeri Government's 
control. Naturally, Baku officials affirm the unacceptability 
of such an approach to resolving the conflict. President Geydar 
Aliyev thinks that so far Moscow is not holding a sufficiently 
principled posture in the matter of settling the problem. He 
made such a remark while meeting in Baku on 23 April with Sergey 
Baburin, coordinator of the "Russian Path" deputy group, who 
arrived there in the capacity of Russian Federation State Duma 
delegation head. 
  The unanimity with which the parliamentarians and the 
republic's government reject the Russian peace plan in its 
present variant is primarily attributed to fears about 
introducing Russian troops to Azerbaijan territory. The men in 
Baku think that the very presence of Russian troops in the 
region of conflict would hardly secure a stable cease-fire. The 
republic's diplomatic circles believe that the persistence with 
which Moscow proposes that the peace plan be approved is 
dictated first and foremost by the desire to take over complete 
control of the Azerbaijan-Turkey border, restoring thereby its 
military control over this Transcaucasus republic. Naturally, 
not only Azerbaijan but also neighboring Iran and Turkey do not 
conceal their worry over this kind of preparations by Moscow.

  [Text] Baku (April 25) TURAN -- "Model of peace restoration 
at the Balkans must be used in Karabakh as well", said Turkish 
Foreign Minister, Hikmet Cetin, at yesterday's Baku briefing. 
  "Turkey will exert economic, political and diplomatic 
pressure on Armenia and even will put on embargo until the 
latter withdrawn its troops from Azeri territories", said 
Foreign Minister of Turkey. 
  Cetin said that the main condition of the conduction of the 
Minsk conference is liberation of occupied territories of 
Azerbaijan. 
  Turkish Foreign Minister said that Russia must not settle 
the 
conflict alone. "Peacemaking forces must be international, 
according to the resolution of the CSCE", said Cetin. 
  Last Sunday Foreign Minister Cetin was on a one-day working 
visit to Baku. 
  He met with the Chairman of the Parliament, Rasul Guliyev 
and 
the Foreign Minister, Gasan Gasanov, later he was received by 
President Aliyev. 
  Azerbaijan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Cetin 
arrived in Baku to realize agreements and protocols signed 
during President Aliyev's visit to Turkey. 
  As was known, Cetin held consultations concerning the matter 
of Azerbaijan's entrance the NATO programme "Partnership in the 
Sake of Peace". 
  Speaking with Azeri President Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin 
mentioned that Turkey intends to strengthen many-sided 
cooperation with Azerbaijan. 
  President Aliyev said that the UNO and the CSCE are very 
passive and the resolutions adopted by them have no effect. 
  President Aliyev mentioned that after the failure of the 
tripartite initiative of the USA, Russia and Turkey, Russia 
announced about its intention to be the only mediator in the 
settlement of the conflict. 
  "But we did not accept Russian settlement plan since it did 
not suit Azerbaijan's interests", said Aliyev. After that the 
Armenian troops resumed the attack. Armenia says if Azerbaijan 
does not accept Russian settlement plan, we will seize Ganja. 
  Geydar Aliyev mentioned that "Armenian tries to force us to 
take humiliating peace. It has several forces supplying it with 
guns and ammunitions". 
  According to President Aliyev, the CSCE and the UN must 
activize peacemaking activity to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict honestly. 
  "We are ready to peaceful resolutions, but the conditions of 
the truce must be just", said President Aliyev.

  [Text] Baku (April 27) TURAN--Yesterday President Aliyev 
signed the programme of privatization for 1994, which further 
was sent to the discussion of the Parliament. 
  The draft of the programme was prepared by the Committee for 
Property. 
  "The programme stipulates that approximately 8,000 objects 
of 
trade, public utilities, enterprises and non-completed 
constructions will be privatized," specialist of the State 
Committee for Property, Mamedrasul Bilalov, told TURAN's 
correspondent. 
  During privatisation the preference will be given to 
employees of this or that enterprise. Only if the employees 
refuse to purchase their enterprise, the latter can be sold 
through the auctions. 
  "Each Azeri citizen irrespective of age will have special 
account in bank totalling 5,000 manats. These means can be used 
only during privatisation and for purchasing of shares. Index 
system will be used to protect these means from inflation," said 
Bagirov.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The press secretary to 
the Russian president today issued a statement from the Russian 
president, which says: 
  "I am filled with indignation at the news of the villainous 
murder of State Duma deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis. I share the 
grief of the murdered man's near and dear. I join my voice to 
the expressions of protest from deputies. The murder of a 
deputy is an encroachment not just on human life, but also on 
the institution of state authority. I have issued instructions 
for urgent measures to be taken to find the criminals. They 
will be tracked down and will get the punishment they deserve. 
  "Sharing our common grief in this dramatic hour, I would 
like 
to express my hope that the State Duma and its deputies will 
find the right response to this heinous act. Let this tragedy 
be our warning against violence, let our common grief unite us 
on our road in search for accord and peace for Russia and its 
people."

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The State Duma today 
passed a resolution in connection with the killing of Deputy 
Andrey Daynisovich Ayzderdzis. 
  "The State Duma deputy's murder, one of thousands of serious 
crimes that have swamped the towns and villages of Russia, 
should justify the adoption of decisive steps in the fight 
against crime," says the statement, an account of which has been 
released by the State Duma's press service. 
  The statement establishes that, in a situation where the 
crime world is openly on the offensive, the government and the 
law enforcement agencies are not taking effective action to stop 
criminal encroachments upon citizens and are thereby risking not 
only the lives of individuals, but the very existence of the 
Russian state system. 
  The document goes on to say: "Realistically assessing the 
situation which has arisen today, the extent of the approaching 
danger, the threshold which has been crossed by the criminal 
milieu and the potential tragic consequences for the country's 
multimillion population, we most decisively demand that the 
President of the Russian Federation [RF], as the guarantor of 
human and civil rights and liberties to the maximal degree, uses 
his constitutional powers to bring order, without delay or 
compromise, to this most important area of our everyday life." 
  The State Duma considered it necessary to demand that the 
country's president dismiss the minister of internal affairs of 
the RF immediately. As for themselves, the deputies voiced 
their readiness to examine and adopt as a priority "urgent 
legislative acts in the fight against crime."

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The State Duma has demanded of the 
Russian Federation president the immediate firing of Minister of 
Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin from his post and "to put his 
constitutional powers to maximum use to set things to rights 
without delay and in an uncompromising manner." 
  This is contained in a statement adopted today by an 
overwhelming majority of votes -- 239 in favor, 11 against, and 
four abstaining -- in connection with the murder of State Duma 
Deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis. This crime, opine the authors of the 
document, should spark resolute measures to combat crime. 
Deputies think that the government and law and order protection 
bodies are failing to take effective action to stop the criminal 
encroachment against citizens "which threatens not just the 
lives of individuals, but the very existence of Russian 
statehood."

this is in the interests of state "and not in the interests of

  Viktor Yerin made this statement in connection with today's 
demands voiced in the Duma by deputies. Some Duma politicians 
have appraised the murder of their colleague Andrey Ayzderdzis 
as proof that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is unable to curb 
crime.

  [Text] We have just received a report by an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent which has just been brought into the studio. 
Russian Head of Government Viktor Chernomyrdin did not agree 
today with the demands by several deputies to dismiss Viktor 
Yerin, the minister of internal affairs. The correspondent 
learned this from participants in the closed sitting of the 
State Duma which is debating the circumstances and consequences 
of the murder of the deputy Ayzderdzis. 
  An interval in the sitting has now been announced. The 
journalists managed to find out that Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke 
at the sitting, reading out a message by the Russian president 
to the Duma in connection with the deputy's murder, and also 
answering questions from those present. In particular, reacting 
to the demand for Viktor Yerin's dismissal, the head of the 
cabinet said that he was not in favor of shuffling the cards. 
  During the interval, the factions will discuss a draft 
decision of the Duma on yesterday's crime. For the time being 
it is hard to predict how events will develop. In the view of 
Vladimir Lysenko, a representative of the Yabloko faction, in 
addition to the fate of the minister of internal affairs, the 
issue of the prospects for the signing of the treaty on public 
accord will inevitably come up during the debate. The deputy 
believes that under the present circumstances, the treaty has 
little chance of being signed. As reported, the signing was 
planned for tomorrow.

  [Text] The State Duma has adopted a political statement on 
the assassination of Deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis in the Moscow 
suburban town of Khimki on Tuesday night. It demands that the 
Russian president, as the guarantor of the citizens' rights and 
freedoms, use his constitutional powers for restoring order and 
investigating this crime. 
  Vladimir Medvedev, the leader of the New Regional Policy 
faction to which Ayzderdzis belonged, told the State Duma that 
the deputies who had visited the scene of murder had established 
that it was a political assassination. 
  Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party's faction Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky demanded that the date for signing the Civic Accord 
agreement be put off until May 10, and that the deputies be 
given the right to keep weapons. He also demanded an immediate 
resignation of Interior Minister Viktor Yerin and expressed 
readiness to become Russia's interior minister. 
  Interfax has learned that at its Wednesday sitting, held due 
to the murder of parliamentarian Andrey Ayzderdzis, the LDPR 
faction of the State Duma gave its backing to the proposal of 
its leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky who demanded new elections for 
the post of State Duma speaker -- now held by Ivan Rybkin. 
  in his interview with journalists leader of the Yabloko 
faction Grigoriy Yavlinsky declared that the murder of the State 
Duma deputy demonstrates once more that "today we are not ready 
to sign an agreement on civic accord and it is impossible to 
build such an accord on blood." He pointed out that the Yabloko 
faction would support the demand for the resignation of Interior 
Minister Viktor Yerin, however it would categorically oppose 
attempts of individual opposition forces to dismiss Ivan Rybkin. 
  Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice faction pointed 
out in his interview with journalists that the faction does not 
advocate new elections for State Duma speaker, as far as the 
Interior Minister is concerned, this is the prerogative of the 
president.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of 
the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] today demanded the 
resignation of the entire government and of State Duma chairman 
Ivan Rybkin. 
  Speaking at an impromptu news conference in connection with 
the killing yesterday of State Duma deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy announced that the LDPR faction now 
demanded the resignation of the entire government and not just 
several ministers, as it had done earlier, and that it was ready 
to propose its own candidates for the vacant posts. "So far we 
are not demanding the resignation of the president; we are 
offering him a compromise option," the LDPR leader added. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy poured particular scorn on State Duma 
speaker Ivan Rybkin, who in his view was "pushing the Duma 
towards a crisis." The faction leader condemned "Ivan Rybkin's 
defeatist stance on every issue" and said the Duma would not 
empower him to sign the treaty on public accord. He proposed to 
postpone the signing of the document till 12 May to allow time 
to make changes in the government and to suspend privatization.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- It is doubtful that the 
murder of parliament's lower house member Andrey Ayzderdzis was 
connected with his business activities before his election to 
parliament. The murder was "more motivated by politics than 
crime", Valeriy Khomyakov, consultant of the "new regional 
policy" parliamentary group of which the murdered deputy was a 
member, said in an iterview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  At the same time, he did not preclude a chance that the 
lawmaker was killed in connection with his publication of the 
list of 266 major criminals of the Russian underworld with their 
nicknames. Khomyakov called this publication "a possible 
version". 
  According to the consultant, Ayzderdzis was "out of big 
politics" and leaned to right-wing centrists according to his 
sympathies. 
  The lawmaker was in high moods at the group's meeting on 
Tuesday when legislators saw him the last time. He did not show 
any signs of anxiety, Khomyakov said. 
  The "New Regional Policy" group at the lower house made a 
statement on Wednesday concerning the murder of independent 
legislator Ayzderdzis on April 26 who was shot point blank at 
the entrance to his house in Moscow's satellite city of Khimki. 
  The statement says that a new name was added to the bleak 
list of contract murders, increasingly committed for political 
reasons. A deputy of the supreme body of power was killed for 
the first time. 
  Criminals committed a heinous crime against an individual 
which become a common feature in Russia of late. The gaunlet 
was again thrown to society, the president, the government and 
parliament. 
  The state, bodies of authority and law enforcement organs 
again strikingly displayed their helplessness and flimsiness in 
the struggle against crime. 
  Further passivity and abstention from tough, energetic and 
resolute measures aimed at stopping and eradicating crimes and 
wrong-doings, puts into growing jeopardy both the life of 
individual people and the very existence of Russian statehood, 
the document stresses. 
  The parliamentary group demanded that "the president of the 
Russian Federation as guarantor of human rights and freedoms 
should use his constitutional powers to the utmost for immediate 
and uncompromising work to establish law and order in this 
important sphere of our every-day life". 
  The statement by the group was also signed by lower house 
speaker Ivan Rybkin. 
  Following the return of the lower house's delegation from 
the 
place of the murder, speaker Rybkin announced a closed session 
of the house. Deputies voted at the start of the session that 
Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and heads of law enforcement 
bodies of Russia should be present at the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the `New Regional Policy' Deputies' Group," </F>
signed by V.S. Medvedev, leader of "New Regional Policy," and 
I.P. Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly 
State Duma; no date given; carried under the rubric "In the 
State Duma"] 
  [Text] On 26 April at 2030 hours the life of Andrey 
Daynisovich Ayzderdzis, an independent State Duma deputy, was 
cut short in his 35th year. He was shot at point-blank range at 
the entrance to the ordinary dwelling house in which he lived in 
the Moscow Oblast city of Khimki. 
  Yet another name is entered on the gloomy list of contract 
killings increasingly being committed for political motives. 
For the first time a deputy of the supreme legislative organ, 
the Federal Assembly State Duma, has been murdered. A Russian 
citizen has been murdered. A human being, to put it simply, has 
been murdered. Insolently. Boldly. Mercilessly. 
  Once again -- and at the same time, for the first time -- 
one 
of the most terrible crimes against the person, which in recent 
times have become a common phenomenon in our country, has been 
committed. Once again a challenge has been hurled to society, 
the president, the government, and parliament. Once again the 
helplessness and impotence of the state, the organs of power, 
and the law-enforcement organs in the battle against crime are 
revealed in all their nakedness. 
  Once again we all -- all deputies, the whole nation -- are 
persuaded of this through our own bitter experience. 
  The subsequent inactivity, passivity, and failure to adopt 
tough, energetic, and decisive measures aimed at scotching and 
eradicating crime and violations of the law place in 
ever-growing jeopardy not only the lives of individual people, 
but the very existence of Russian statehood itself (in any of 
its forms). 
  Soberly assessing the currently prevailing situation, the 
scale of the imminent danger, the bounds which criminal elements 
have transgressed, and the possible tragic consequences for the 
country's multimillion population, we demand, with all the 
decisiveness at our command, that the Russian Federation 
president, as the guarantor of human and civic rights and 
freedoms, and as himself a citizen, make maximum use of his 
constitutional powers for the urgent and uncompromising 
imposition of order in this most important sphere of our 
everyday life. 
  We express firm confidence that the first step in this 
complex and difficult battle will be the investigation of the 
murder of our colleague and the proper punishment of his 
murderers. 
  Criminals and instigators of murders must be found, 
convicted, and suffer their merited punishment. 
  Peace must triumph in our country. 
  [Signed] V.S. Medvedev, leader of the "New Regional Policy" 
deputies' group. 
  I.P. Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly State Duma.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The deputies of the Federation 
Council have decided to set up a permanent working group which 
would work on anti-crisis measures in the Russian economy 
together with the government and the Russian president's 
administration. Today they discussed the question of the crisis 
in the country's economy, but voted down the draft resolution on 
this issue. Several committees of the chamber have been 
instructed to generalize the proposals that were made during the 
rather long discussion and to submit them to the next sitting. 
  However, an opinion was voiced that this type of document 
should not be adopted altogether, as "just another piece of 
paper" would not lead to any results. Instead of this it should 
be demanded that the government adopt and publish a program of 
anti-crisis measures. 
  The "complete absence of any consistent and sensible policy 
of the national economy" in the draft resolution was named as 
the "main strategic error of the government." The absence of 
"macroeconomic planning and of a mechanism for its 
implementation" was also held against them.

<F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina, especially </F>
for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI: "Speaker Ivan Rybkin's 100 Days in 
Office"] 
  [Text] "We are already through the first quarter," Ivan 
Rybkin, chairman of the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly, 
said recently about the State Duma, and consequently about 
himself. This measure of time, to which we are accustomed, can 
be replaced by the 100-day period which has been adopted in the 
West, whereupon preliminary assessments of a political leader's 
activity are made. 
  The ascent of the former leader of the "Communists of 
Russia" 
faction in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and currently 
member of the Russian Federation Agrarian Party, to the post of 
State Duma chairman, was at first perceived very cautiously and 
coolly by politicians and the press. However, since his first 
few weeks of leading the lower chamber of the parliament, Ivan 
Rybkin has "grown" perceptibly in the eyes of the 
deputies-democrats and observers, thanks primarily to the 
striking contrast with Ruslan Khasbulatov. Unlike him, the new 
speaker does not pull up people who are speaking, he does not 
get involved in arguments with them, and -- and this is very 
important for a speaker -- does not put the stress on the wrong 
syllables. According to an ironic observation by NTV Chief 
Editor Igor Malashenko following an interview with Ivan Rybkin 
on the ITOGI program, "this is the first politician in our 
country who knows the word `definition.'" 
  You can assume how difficult it is for a "communist 
speaker," 
as Ivan Rybkin is described by the world news agencies, to 
balance between the right wing and the left wing in the Duma. 
In this regard, the most dramatic event for him in the 100 days 
of his chairmanship has been the vote in the Duma on the package 
of decisions on the amnesty. On the one hand, the 
Zhirinovskiyites, the Communists, and the Agrarians would not 
have forgiven the head of the Duma for defecting while, on the 
other hand, the presidential and democratic wing was following 
his stance vigilantly, as if with X-ray eyes. In this tense 
clash, Ivan Rybkin saved face thanks to the readiness 
demonstrated by the Russian Federation president's aide Georgiy 
Satarov to submit to the State Duma sitting the question of 
amending the decree on a political amnesty, which, however, was 
not fated to come about. On the other hand, the chairman of the 
State Duma did not generate irritation among his own supporters 
either, since he is upholding the material and housing interests 
of former Russian Federation people's deputies before the 
Presidential Administration, including the instigators of the 
3-4 October events in Moscow. "Magnanimity disheartens 
opponents, and it is impossible to approach civil peace without 
the idea of forgetting the past," -- that is how Ivan Rybkin 
answered my question about whether he considers the transfer of 
Moscow apartments to the ownership of Ilya Konstantinov and 
Sergey Baburin, for example, to be moral. 
  However, in his plan to transform his views from communist 
ones to social-democratic ones, Ivan Rybkin is generating sharp 
condemnation in the opposition camp. At the March rally in 
Moscow, devoted to the anniversary of the referendum on 
preserving the USSR, the speakers publicly renounced their 
former kindred spirit, which undoubtedly worked to the benefit 
of the centrist image of the chairman of the lower chamber of 
the parliament. "I am not the speaker of two factions, but of 
the entire Duma," Ivan Rybkin said about this. 
  Members of the "Russia's Choice" faction, who at first did 
not trust the speaker -- who was not "one of their men" by 
definition -- now clearly sympathize with him. Furthermore, 
judging by the results of the visit by a State Duma delegation 
headed by Ivan Rybkin to Finland, I would boldly call his views 
on economics entirely liberal. At a meeting with the leadership 
of the Central Union of Industry and Employers in Helsinki, the 
Duma speaker sharply rebuked the "state parasites, running to 
Chernomyrdin for money," and promised to use his powers for the 
adoption of laws on granting only targeted credits, accompanied 
by clear control of their use. 
  Giving his own assessment of his 100 days of endeavors in 
the 
post of speaker, Ivan Rybkin noted with satisfaction in our 
conversation that the "chamber has not decided to implement the 
principle of formal majority [formalnoye bolshinstvo] in 
adopting decisions," and he added that in Russia's history it 
has actually been the minority which has often turned out to be 
right. 
  Ivan Rybkin considers the adoption of the federal budget for 
the second quarter and the joint work with the government on the 
draft budget for 1994 and 1995 to be on the positive side of the 
State Duma's activity. In addition, he also singled out serious 
work done by the chamber, such as the Civil, Land, Electoral, 
and Administrative Codes, prepared for examination at the State 
Duma's sitting. 
  For journalists, the most important indicator of a 
politician's opinions remains his attitude to the press, for 
which Ruslan Khasbulatov was particularly "famous." Again, 
unlike him, when asked whether it is not time for the government 
and the parliament to give up the state press organs, Ivan 
Rybkin answered that, apart from a few individual deputies, the 
State Duma does not lay claim to its own press organ, and is 
prepared to be satisfied with a supplement in ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA, where adopted laws will be officially published. At the 
same time, the chamber speaker believes, the State Duma should 
not "support" the entire newspaper, but should only pay for 
expenditure involved in publishing the supplement. He also 
deems it necessary to provide a certain number of hours of 
broadcasting on state television for the federal organs of 
power, citing the experience of the BBC state television company 
in Britain. On the other hand, Ivan Rybkin warned journalists 
against "going to the other extreme, when individual economic 
groups make the mass media subordinate to themselves." 
  A fine morning augurs a nice day. May the "weather" in the 
State Duma speaker's mutual relations with the president, the 
deputies' factions, and the press remain fine -- previous 
political storms which raged on the political pinnacle, cost 
society too dear.

  [Text] Sochi April 26 TASS -- "Armed sorties and subversive 
acts, staged by Georgian armed units, are becoming most frequent 
in the Galiy District of Abkhazia," says a statement of the 
Abkhazian Defence Ministry, released today by the republic's 
Ministry for Information and the Press. 
  The statement recalls that Georgian armed units had crossed 
the Inguri River on the left-hand flank of the confrontation 
line in the afternoon of April 24. Three Georgians were killed 
during the ensuing battle. "The Abkhazian Defence Ministry 
assesses these actions as yet another attempt to torpedo the 
talks on the peaceful settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict," the statement says.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 April (SNARK) -- The entrance of the UN 
peacekeeping forces is the key-item in the settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. It is impossible to put an end to 
the conflict without it. This declaration was made by the 
personal representative of the Georgian head Sandro Kavsadze in 
an exclusive interview to SNARK. 
  In his opinion, dislocation of peacekeeping forces all over 
the territory of Abkhazia meets the interests of both 
conflicting sides, for it will guarantee the coming back of 
Georgian refugees, as well as protect Abkhazia from the possible 
Georgian attacks.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 27 April (SNARK) -- If till 10 May the UNO 
[United Nations Organization] does not pass a resolution on 
bringing the international peacekeeping forces into the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone, Georgia will resort to other 
mechanisms of settlement of the problem. This declaration was 
made today by the new chairman of Georgian Committee on human 
rights defence and ethnic relations Sandro Kavsadze in an 
interview to SNARK. 
  In his words, such mechanism could be the CIS collective 
security forces. "We cannot wait. Otherwise, the situation in 
Abkhazia may become ungovernable, and the conflict will acquire 
a large-scale character," stressed Kavsadze. 
  Besides, he noted that official Tbilisi raises the question 
of expanding the mandate of the UN observers dislocated in the 
conflict zone, and increasing their number.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi, 27 April (TASS) -- The Georgian parliament 
has adopted a law on weapons, which will come into force on 15 
May. The authors of this legislation -- members of the Georgian 
parliament's legal commission -- today commented on this 
document during a press conference in Tbilisi. Journalists were 
told that the adoption of the new law was dictated by two 
factors. Firstly, the Georgian law enforcement bodies are now 
unable to ensure the protection and safety of every citizen and 
his home. Secondly, the republic is, literally speaking, 
flooded with weapons, and the new law will allow the authorities 
to control them to some extent and to regulate the production, 
sale, and storage of pistols and revolvers. 
  Georgia will apparently draw on Russia's weapon-making 
potential, primarily on the Tula and Izhevsk plants, famous for 
their top-quality pistols and revolvers. 
  At the same time, the law allows the Georgian Government to 
issue licences to legal persons not only to purchase and sale 
wholesale consignments of short-barrel weapons, but also to 
manufacture them. 
  All the citizens of Georgia, upon reaching the age of 18, 
will be entitled to purchase and possess weapons if they are 
able-bodied, sane, not addicted to drugs or alcohol, and 
"socially reliable," i.e. normally disposed towards neighbours 
and the society as a whole. 
  However, the law regulates the calibre and barrel length of 
the weapons, as well as their other tactical-technical 
characteristics. The organisers of the press conference assured 
the journalists that all the necessary regulatory enactments 
would be ready before 15 May, which is rather dubious, of course.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] In the evening of 26 April Georgian parliament 
concluded confirmation of the composition of the Cabinet of 
Ministers. Despite the rejection of the parliamentary opposition 
to participate in the confirmation procedure which is lasting 
for a month already the list of candidates proposed by Georgia's 
leader Eduard Shevardnadze was adopted without any changes. 
  Almost all of the confirmed members of the Cabinet headed by 
Premier Otar Patsatsiya have already worked in the government 
with the exception of Vice Premier on economic reform Teimuraz 
Basiliya and Defense Minister Lieutenant General Varden 
Nadibaidze. 
  The new head of the military department and former deputy 
commander of the Group of the Russian forces in Transcaucases 
reported to INTERFAX that the proposal to become a defense 
minister "was slightly unexpected for him." "However, I have 
accepted it and, of course, at the first stage of my work on 
this post I shall get acquainted with the people and with the 
situation in the Georgian Army," he said. 
  Speaking about the Georgian Army, Nadibaidze declared that 
"the Army should be disciplined, mobile, and combat efficient." 
"In order to create such an army we need assistance of the 
state, I think that we shall receive this aid," he said. 
  When asked about his position with respect to the settlement 
of the Abkhazian conflict, Nadibaidze said that "the 
negotiations on this issue are underway but they would not 
determine everything." 
  On Wednesday in Tbilisi, Shevardnadze presented Nadibaidze 
to 
the staff of the Defense Ministry. The press center of the 
ministry reported to Interfax that addressing the ministry's 
board, Shevardnadze expressed hope that this appointment would 
assist in a faster making of the Georgian Army and increase its 
combat efficiency.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of staff of </F>
the Ukrainian Army, by Michel Rosten in Brussels; date not 
given: "General Anatoliy Lopata Optimistic About Black Sea 
Agreement"] 
  [Text] General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of staff of the 
Ukrainian Army, made a stopover in Brussels (he will visit NATO 
this Tuesday [26 April]) on his return from the United States, 
where he was received at the Pentagon. The question of his 
country's denuclearization was discussed as was the dispute over 
the Black Sea Fleet. Following an idea by Defense Minister 
General Vitaliy Radetsky, he sounded out the Americans on the 
proposal of "bringing a third party into the discussions to 
encourage the conclusion" of the negotiations. But, on Saturday 
[23 April], according to the Russian press agency INTERFAX, 
President Kravchuk, in agreement with Moscow, stated on 
Ukrainian radio that the question of the fleet should be solved 
without the intervention of a "third party." 
  [Rosten] How do you explain the fact that your president 
took 
that position? 
  [Lopata] I think our president's stance is that this is a 
bilateral problem. He probably thinks we should use all 
diplomatic means and adopt the most rational approaches for the 
division of the fleet. And it is only when all the possible 
solutions have been rejected that we should resort to the 
mediation of a third party. (The Netherlands has been approached 
-- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note). 
  [Rosten] What kind of relations can Ukraine still maintain 
with President Meshkov, who is openly expressing his opposition 
to the presence of the Ukrainian fleet in Crimean ports? 
  [Lopata] The positions here are clear. Crimean President 
Meshkov is pursuing a policy which is not that of Ukraine but 
that of Russia. He is violating Ukrainian laws. The presence 
of the Ukrainian Army and the creation of a Ukrainian fleet in 
Crimea have no justification in Mr. Meshkov's mind. I think 
that his opinions do not reflect our approach to ensuring the 
state's defense. 
  [Rosten] Several agreements have already been reached at the 
highest level on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. None has 
been respected. Why? 
  [Lopata] Russia does not see any problem in dividing the 
Black Sea Fleet. Over the past two years, it has stressed that 
it was prepared to divide this fleet and even to ensure that 
Ukraine could form its own fleet but provided the whole 
infrastructure -- and hence the bases -- remains Russia's 
property. That approach to settling the question cannot satisfy 
Ukraine. As a state, it has its viewpoint both on the division 
of the fleet and on that of the naval forces in the existing 
bases. Ukraine would like the agreements on the division of the 
fleet and the leasing of part of the infrastructure to the 
Russian Federation to be decided in a civilized way, respecting 
its interests and specifying the timing of the leasing of bases 
by the Russian fleet. What is now being proposed to Ukraine is 
unacceptable. A compromise is necessary and I think it will be 
found. 
  [Rosten] But the Russians also want to safeguard their 
interests... 
  [Lopata] If there was an amiable settlement, Ukraine would 
benefit from good prospects for the creation of its own naval 
forces on the basis of the division of the whole Soviet fleet, 
in whose creation it actively participated. Compared with the 
whole of this fleet, it is obvious that the Black Sea Fleet is 
merely an insignificant part. Ukraine could therefore have 
claims on the whole fleet of the former USSR but because it 
understands Russia's strategic problems in the region of the 
Black Sea basin and the Mediterranean basin, it has accepted the 
principle of a division of all the Black Sea vessels. With 
regard to its share, in other words around 200 ships, Ukraine 
has the opportunity to decide which ships should form part of 
its own naval force... It might suggest that Russia should buy 
those it does not need. As for the form of cooperation, it 
could take different on forms: Instead of handing over ships, 
it could involve handing over weapons or other equipment vital 
to the Ukrainian fleet. We have agreed with Russia on this 
approach. It is the division of the infrastruture which is 
causing a great problem in our relations. Russia wants to 
remain in these bases forever. 
  [Rosten] You are on your way home from the United States 
where you discussed the problem of the denuclearization of 
Ukraine. Will the new Parliament be more successful in settling 
this than the previous one? 
  [Lopata] Ukraine is meticulously implementing the agreements 
on the transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia. So far, it has 
transferred three convoys of weapons of this type in exchange 
for which it has received a convoy of nuclear fuel. 
  [Rosten] The Russian press has launched a campaign against 
Ukraine, accusing it of storing chemical and biological weapons. 
What is your answer to these accusations? 
  [Lopata] I can only say this: There are no such weapons on 
Ukrainian territory. All the weapons which belonged to the 
chemical or biological sector were transported out of Ukrainian 
territory before the creation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 
  [Rosten] Is the general dispute between Kiev and Moscow not 
likely to degenerate in the military sphere? 
  [Lopata] The problem of relations between Ukraine and Russia 
-- two states with equal rights -- must obviously be solved at 
the level of diplomatic relations. If, in these relations, the 
armed forces of one or other state make their voice heard, we 
must pay attention to it. But that voice must have limits that 
prohibit the use of arms. What happened in Odessa is pure 
provocation, but Kiev and Moscow have managed to control that 
incident, which they do not want to see repeated.

  [Text] The problem of the Black Sea Fleet should not affect 
the possibility of and the date for Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Ukraine, INTERFAX-Ukraine was told on Tuesday [26 April] by the 
head of the Ukrainian president's service for international 
affairs, Anton Buteyko. 
  He said that at the talks in Sevastopol agreements were 
outlined on the splitting of warships and vessels of the Black 
Sea Fleet. There is also the decision of the presidents on the 
Fleets' separate basing and we do not see any other variants, 
said Buteyko. 
  He said that the presidents of Russia and Ukraine at the 
recent meeting in Moscow stressed the priority importance for 
the swift working out of the treaty on friendship and 
cooperation between the two countries. Buteyko said that 
Ukraine was prepared long ago for the signing of a comprehensive 
agreement. 
  The spokesman also said that the Ukrainian side had sent its 
proposals to Moscow on time. However, later the process had 
become stalled. 
  Buteyko said that now a new impetus was given to the 
preparatory process and Ukraine is doing everything possible so 
that the document proves to be acceptable for both sides.

  [Text] The Black Sea Fleet seriously disapproved of 
Ukraine's position which had insisted that Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov not take part in the recent talks on the Black Sea 
Fleet between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers. This 
was announced by Chief of the Black Sea Fleet headquarters, Rear 
Admiral Petr Svyatashov in an interview with INTERFAX. 
  He repeated that in accordance with Ukrainian legislation on 
power-sharing the Crimean leadership and its executive and 
legislative bodies must be informed on the establishment of new 
military units and dislocation of the troops. 
  Svyatashov suggested that the Ukrainian defense minister had 
considered his authority to be higher that the Ukrainian law on 
power-sharing adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. 
  The last developments when a Ukrainian Navy patrol post had 
been established in order to control the Black Sea Fleet naval 
infantry in the Kazachya Bay (Sevastopol) undermined all the 
statement by General Vitaliy Radetskyy on friendly intentions 
and peace civilized settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue, 
Svyatashov said.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1000 GMT on 26 April carries a four-minute report 
on the recent Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet in 
Sevastopol. 
  Correspondent Vasyl Kukurichka asks Colonel General Ivan 
Bizhan, a member of the Ukrainian delegation and deputy defense 
minister of Ukraine, about his impressions of the talks. Bizhan 
replies: "When we arrived here with specific intentions and 
specific proposals with regard to resolving this problem -- I 
will tell you that Army General Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy, 
the defense minister, and we, too, searched for all ways to 
carry out the instructions of our presidents. I will say that 
our proposals and our approaches to this matter were, well, very 
flexible. 
  "In the first place we took account of the social situation 
and social problems, the current situation, the future 
situation, but unfortunately, we did not meet such an approach 
from the Russian side -- I am not talking about diplomats, I am 
talking about the military. From the Russian side we met 
demands that only that part of the Black Sea Fleet which will go 
to Russia should be based in Crimea, but Ukraine's Navy should 
be based beyond the boundaries of Crimea. 
  ``I will tell you that this is not only...[pauses] well, I 
do 
not see at all how one can dictate such conditions to a state, 
in which the other state would like to be based. I think that 
the problem of where the navies will be based is, after all, not 
Russia's problem, but Ukraine's problem. But where the part of 
the Black Sea Fleet, which will go to Russia, will be based -- 
this is precisely its problem, and therefore it should resolve 
this problem, absolutely taking account of the interests of our 
state, but unfortunately, as I have already said, we did not see 
such a constructive attitude from the Russian side.''

  [Text] Kiev -- In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent 
on 27 April, the Ukrainian presidential press service official 
in charge of domestic policy matters, Mykola Mykhalchenko, 
described as "irresponsible" the statement by Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov, Sevastopol Council Chairman Viktor Semenov, and 
Black Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin regarding the breakdown 
of the Ukrainian-Russian negotiations on the problem of dividing 
the Black Sea Fleet. The statement emphasizes, in particular, 
that "the disintegration of Ukrainian statehood is possible and 
attempts are being made to make the Republic of Crimea 
responsible for that process, and penalize it harshly because of 
this. It is not difficult, with the aid of provocations, to 
create an unstable situation in the Republic and capitalize on 
this to introduce a state of emergency, thus pushing relations 
between Russia and Ukraine to the brink of war." In the view of 
the statement's authors, "urgent steps are needed to prevent a 
threat of the emergence of a new Yugoslavia." Mykola 
Mykhalchenko said: "These people are in fact outsiders. Yuriy 
Meshkov is losing prestige on the Crimean peninsula. There are 
rumors that Eduard Baltin cannot resign for the same reason, 
i.e., because of his unpopularity among the sailors [sentence 
as received]. It is clear that Viktor Semenov needs to score 
points ahead of the election of Sevastopol's mayor."

  [Text] Kiev, 26 Apr -- A Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry 
delegation, led by Ambassador at Large Andriy Ozadovskyy, is 
back from a tour of the Balkan Peninsula's countries. At its 
meetings with Bosnian Serb and Muslim leaders in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, issues of the possibility of halting combat 
operations in that region were discussed, and steps to put into 
practice the UN Security Council's resolution on a political 
settlement to the Yugoslav crisis, as well as questions of 
guaranteeing the safety of the peacekeeping forces' contingents 
that were taking part in UN operations to secure peace, were 
examined. 
  Ukraine is concerned about the UN decision to deploy the 
Ukrainian peacekeeping forces battalion in the area of the town 
of Gorazde where lately there has been intensive fighting. It 
was emphasized at the meeting between Mr. Ozadovskyy and the 
command of the UN forces in Yugoslavia that decisions on the 
Ukrainian contingent further participating in UN peacekeeping 
operations should be made with the safety of our military 
personnel taken into consideration. That is why it is only 
after combat operations in the Gorazde area are halted that the 
Ukrainian peacekeepers can be deployed there.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- As a high-ranking 
representative of the Ukrainian president's administration, who 
wished to remain unidentified, told a UNIAN correspondent today, 
the comment by the Russian side, which took part in the Black 
Sea Fleet negotiations with the Ukrainian military in 
Sevastopol, to the effect that the delegation from Kiev was 
responsible for the breakdown of the negotiations, is totally 
absurd. According to him, Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev has not explained, as yet, the reasons behind his 
unexpected disappearance from Sevastopol and refusal to put his 
signature under the mutually acceptable and coordinated -- by 
the expert commissions of both countries -- document on the 
division of the sea-going force of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  "Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who headed 
the 
Ukrainian delegation, offered compromise variants to solve the 
issues under consideration, however, the Russian side exercised 
the tactics of the `elder brother,' applying various methods of 
pressure, including diplomatic ones. It seems that the problem 
cannot be solved without the participation of a third party, if 
they raise the question in this manner and insist that the naval 
forces of Ukraine must be based outside Crimea, although it 
would be unadvisable to resort to the variant that occurred 
during the solution of the nuclear arms issue," pointed out the 
high-ranking representative. 
  In his opinion, no matter what conditions they set in 
Moscow, 
the reality is such that both the naval forces of Ukraine and 
the Russian Navy must be stationed in Sevastopol. What is more, 
both the naval base in Donuzlav and the Sevastopol base could be 
granted to Russia on lease. The rest of the bases on the 
peninsula, including those in Kerch and Feodosiya, are the 
property of Ukraine, and the Russian ships can stay there by 
agreement only. 
  The representative of the Ukrainian president's 
administration also believes that Black Sea Fleet Commander 
Eduard Baltin is, undoubtedly, the initiator of the 
anti-Ukrainian actions at the Black Sea Fleet. The statement on 
the results of the Black Sea Fleet negotiations, which he signed 
jointly with Yuriy Meshkov and Viktor Semenov, the chairman of 
the Sevastopol City Council, is an evidence "of the desire to 
openly manifest the revanchist, great power stand of the Russian 
Federation." 
  As an UNIAN correspondent learned from the circles close to 
the Russian military department, after the negotiations in 
Sevastopol Defense Minister Pavel Grachev issued an instruction 
to revise the cadre of the Russian Army, removing officers of 
Ukrainian descent from high posts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
INTERFAX agency journalists "specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI"; 
at INTERFAX Moscow headquarters, date not given: "Leonid 
Kravchuk: God Forbid Our Peoples Should Quarrel! During the CIS 
Heads of State Conference in the Russian Capital Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk Visited INTERFAX Moscow Headquarters 
and Answered the Agency Journalists' Questions"] 
  [Text] [INTERFAX] Leonid Makarovich! Ukraine has signed 
an agreement on joining the CIS Economic Union as an associate 
member. Why that status in particular, and what will that 
status provide for Ukraine? 
  [Kravchuk] I think that the division into "full" and 
"associate" membership of the Economic Union is currently a 
negative thing. I will explain why. While the CIS as a 
structure is in the formation stage, it does not seem possible 
to make a clear distinction between full and associate members 
of the union. For instance, we have signed all the economic 
documents which were put to the CIS Heads of State Council. 
Thus, I believe that in actual fact there is no difference 
between those classed as full members and us associate members 
of the Economic Union. 
  We realize that this may be an artificial distinction at the 
moment, but there is still a "but." The fact is that the 
Ukrainian parliament, when it examined the Treaty on the 
Formation of the CIS, made some appropriate comments and 
stipulations. These are in force to this day. And I as 
president cannot sign any documents ignoring those stipulations. 
This is the explanation for our legal status of associate 
member of the Economic Union. But I would repeat that we are 
playing and will continue to play the most full and active role 
in the Economic Union. 
  [INTERFAX] The second question is also partly connected with 
the form of cooperation. There has been talk about the 
Kazakhstan president's proposal to set up a Eurasian union. A 
number of politicians, not least in Russia -- Sergey Shakhray, 
for instance -- are even calling for an international group of 
experts to be set up to elaborate an overall concept for the 
economic integration of the former Union republics (those which 
want to participate, of course). What is your attitude to these 
proposals? 
  [Kravchuk] I could reply in the words of the sages of old: 
"Do today what can be done today; what cannot be done today (if 
the time is not ripe), postpone until tomorrow." 
  The conditions for integration on the broad scale that 
certain politicians are assuming (taking the EC as their model, 
presumably) are not yet in place here. I do not believe that as 
soon as you sign any decision it starts being implemented all by 
itself; that we signed a decision and the CIS started operating; 
or that we can sign another and the Eurasian union will start 
operating tomorrow.... 
  For this union to work and operate properly the conditions 
for it must be prepared. Step by step. 
  What goals and tasks are we setting? How should we approach 
such goals and tasks? After all, it is no secret that the EC 
has taken 35 years to reach its current position. We have only 
been in the CIS for a few years so far, and we have been unable 
to elaborate the mechanisms for the Commonwealth's activity 
during this period. Many other questions have not been resolved 
either. Not because we have no desire to do so, but because we 
have no opportunity, no conditions. You need to have the right 
conditions to solve any problem -- all the more so when it comes 
to solving such major problems. 
  Second, we must ultimately resolve them in a civilized 
fashion. We need to instruct experts to work seriously on the 
whole range of issues and then consult with the people. Look 
how tolerantly and respectfully the population is treated by the 
European states, where a whole variety of opinion polls are 
carried out. But our mentality is to say that we have met and 
signed another agreement, so it should start operating! That 
the people will see the results later. Actually, this is 
probably not quite correct. 
  That is, I do not reject the idea itself; I merely do not 
want it to immediately become a subject of a political decision, 
because then it will end badly. We cannot yet answer all the 
questions which will be of concern to people in connection with 
the implementation of this proposal. 
  [INTERFAX] It seems that there is currently a certain amount 
of concern among Russian social and official circles about the 
results of the Ukrainian parliamentary elections. The gist of 
this concern is that different political forces with 
diametrically opposed views won in different parts of your 
country. This presupposes a potential either for sharp 
confrontation or, conversely, for state power -- in its desire 
to consolidate society -- to try to play the nationalist card. 
Events in Odessa and all the problems connected with the Black 
Sea Fleet can partly be explained by this theory. What is your 
view on this? 
  [Kravchuk] We need to ask the question as follows: 
Consolidation around what, or confrontation with whom and 
against what? After all, profoundly different forces were also 
victorious in the December elections in Russia, but nobody in 
Russia is yet proposing that that state join with Ukraine. 
Moreover, if some Russian parliamentary deputies allowed 
themselves to suggest as much, they would probably be considered 
not very serious people, to put it quite politely. More 
accurately, the question would arise of whether Ukraine would be 
an independent state in friendship and alliance with Russia or 
whether it would come under Russia. As president I say that I 
want to be in friendship, cooperation, and partnership with 
Russia. But I do not want to be under Russia. 
  Certain people claim that it is wrong to argue in this way, 
on the grounds that such a thing could not happen. Well, 
unfortunately, history has shown that when two states unite, 
tendencies toward a strong ethnic thrust are victorious in the 
historical aspect and in development. That is inevitable. 
  The 340 years of unification with Russia and the 70 years in 
the USSR confirmed that the Ukrainian language has already 
started to disappear from Ukraine and certain traditions of our 
national culture have begun to die off. 
  That is a real fact. It is the reason why we need to 
elaborate a mechanism to ensure that Ukraine and Russia live in 
friendship and partnership as two good-neighborly states. To 
this end we need to resolve some acute issues hampering 
good-neighborliness. 
  For instance, one of these is the nuclear issue. It strikes 
me that we have already resolved it one way or another. I 
personally am glad that the tripartite agreement on issues 
relating to the elimination of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian 
territory are beginning to be fulfilled, albeit with difficulty. 
  Then there is the Black Sea Fleet problem. I think that, on 
the basis of the agreements that have been reached, we will be 
able to solve this problem as well. I want the Odessa incident 
-- without going into details or analyzing who was right or 
wrong -- to be seen as a signal for the immediate and 
constructive resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem. I want 
to stress that when such complex issues are being resolved we 
must all be guided by good intentions. There can be no other 
approach. 
  If the Russian military say that the entire fleet and its 
entire infrastructure should go to Russia, while the Ukrainians 
strive to give nothing, then it is clear that both of these 
positions are both wrong and unrealistic. 
  In confirmation of this I myself would raise the following 
question -- in 1992 prices, the entire Black Sea naval structure 
is worth 35 trillion rubles [R] (the ruble-dollar rate being 
1-1,000 at the time); consequently, the value of the fleet is 
$35 billion (made up of $17.5 billion for Russia and the same 
amount for Ukraine). Ukraine's debt to Russia is $2.5 billion. 
Thus, Russia should pay Ukraine $15 billion and then the ships 
could go to Russia. But this must be done in such a way as to 
ensure that the cost of the ships is paid for first. If we 
recall Ostap Bender, he reaffirmed that we should not first hand 
the ships over and get the money for them 10 years later. But 
is Russia capable of paying this amount of money at the moment? 
It is important to realize that this is not a question of 
nationalistic or imperial aspirations. It is simple economics 
-- will Russia be able to transfer $15 billion to Ukraine? Of 
course not. So we need to proceed on the basis of the actual 
situation and the actual interests of both countries. 
  The Black Sea Fleet problem can be resolved, but it has to 
be in a phased manner. We should begin by dividing up the fleet 
and separating it into different bases. If there are two 
commanders in the same "galley" they are bound to quarrel. I 
recall the period when the Black Sea Fleet was commanded by 
Admiral Igor Kasatonov and the Ukrainian Navy by Admiral B. 
Kozhin. Initially, all was sweetness and light between them. 
But they lived together for a month and the fighting started. 
  I. Kasatonov was replaced by E. Baltin, while B. Kozhin was 
replaced by V. Beskaravaynyy. The first month went well, but 
then the fighting began again. Thus, if the fleets are not 
split up, I am sure that no good will come of it. 
  In the second phase we need to settle the question of the 
Russian naval base, proceeding on the basis of international 
principles. But if the Russian military say that the base means 
not just Sevastopol but Feodosiya, Odessa, Izmail, Nikolayev, 
all the airfields, and so forth, then I in my turn will say: 
"Do you seriously believe that?" Twelve Russian naval bases in 
Ukraine?! Can that be taken seriously? I think not. In any 
case, this decision is parliament's prerogative. In other 
words, the question should be viewed not from the standpoint of 
the navy which the Soviet Union had, but from the standpoint 
solely of the Russian Navy. But the military are unwilling to 
come to terms with this approach; they are pressuring the 
political leadership on both sides. And, under this pressure, 
the political leadership has been constantly postponing the task 
of finding a solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem. 
  For instance, Ukraine has already said several times: "Yes, 
we agree to give up part of our navy, since we do not need such 
a big navy." But, in order to define how to sell it or transfer 
it to Russia, we must be able to examine all the fleet's 
documents. We must know how much it is currently worth, what 
its initial cost was, where the ships are, and what condition 
they are in. We are not trying to monitor every ship, but 
merely to study the necessary documents. But we have not had 
that opportunity. Why is Ukraine being deprived of the right to 
know what it is giving up? There can be no avoiding a political 
decision in this area. Moreover, nor should we be guided by the 
intentions of the naval leaders and the military, because each 
naval leader wants to be a great man. And they see their 
greatness in simple terms: The more ships they have under their 
command, the more important they are. 
  I am convinced that the Russian president understands me 
perfectly. And that is already quite an important first step. 
  [INTERFAX] A conflict between Russia and Ukraine is the most 
terrible thing that could happen. Presumably you too have given 
some thought as to how to prevent even small conflicts, not to 
mention big ones? 
  [Kravchuk] That is the main question for us. We must not 
quarrel even over the Black Sea Fleet -- although this is a 
painful issue for Russia. I understand that. Particularly 
Sevastopol. It is a painful and historical issue for the 
Russian mentality and the Russian leadership. 
  Russia's leadership cannot get away from the Russian 
mentality because, if it did, it would not be the Russian 
leadership. And the Russian leadership should defend Russians, 
as I must defend Ukraine. But we must not go our separate ways 
and end up in a state of mutual enmity. We must not allow our 
peoples to quarrel. Ultimately, this is the most important 
point. This has never happened in the past 340 years. God 
forbid we should ever quarrel. But to prevent this we need to 
display incredible willpower to avoid getting drawn into 
conflict. We need to remember that conflicts are almost always 
started by armed people. Politicians are becoming hostages. All 
of us must prevent this from happening! 
  [INTERFAX] But surely, it is not only armed people who can 
bring about a conflict. Take the problem of energy sources. It 
is no less painful.... 
  [Kravchuk] True, but that is a different sphere. We can 
also include the banking system and loans, and there are 
international norms. We are not confronting one another here 
either, just because we have weapons. After all, weapons can be 
fired! A single shot can cause so many complex problems and 
exacerbate them to such an extent that it may later be not just 
hard but sometimes even impossible to stop a snowballing 
conflict. There are examples of this -- Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
and Georgia. 
  Unfortunately, we already have lessons from which we should 
learn. That is why I advocate that everything should be 
resolved swiftly, without delay. I understand those military 
men who are trying to delay resolution of the issue. They are 
doing this in the expectation that their flag will be raised on 
some ship and that this ship will then de facto go to one or 
other side. Others are counting on the new Crimean leadership to 
conduct its policy in such a way as to "help" to unilaterally 
resolve the Black Sea Fleet problem. But this "help," I am 
convinced, could turn into a tragedy for the two peoples. We 
have no right to quarrel, even over the Crimea. Although I also 
understand the Crimea's role and importance for both parties. 
We need to ensure that the Crimea does not drive us or our 
peoples apart. Because leaders come and go, but peoples remain. 
  [INTERFAX] We get the impression that, when you start 
working together with the Russian president on the most acute 
issues, you find acceptable solutions. Tell us, do you find it 
easy to work with Boris Yeltsin on a purely personal level? 
  [Kravchuk] When I talk about this subject the main thing for 
me is that each people chooses the leader it wants. The 
Russians chose B. Yeltsin, and the Ukrainians chose L. Kravchuk. 
Whether we match each other in character or not, we have to 
find the ability to work together. As for Boris Nikolayevich 
personally, I am able to resolve questions with him, I am able 
to raise problems and to meet with an appropriate reaction -- 
sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but always clear-cut and 
precise. Yes, when we are together we resolve the tasks facing 
us. 
  [INTERFAX] Do you often contact the Kremlin by phone? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course, and not only Boris Nikolayevich. For 
instance, when the Russian president was in Spain and the 
"Odessa incident" occurred, I contacted Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin several times. And I can also reach mutual 
understanding with him. 
  But, unfortunately, our mutual understanding with the top 
Russian leadership is sometimes eroded in the structures "under 
us." And it is at those levels that people start quoting 
arguments, finding legal norms of some kind, remembering some 
international principles that are by no means to our mutual 
advantage, and making a huge number of proposals of all kinds. 
And the main task facing both sides is sometimes lost sight of 
under such a huge pile of documentation.... 
  That is why I would reiterate that the Ukrainian and Russian 
leaderships need above all political will, patience, and 
determination.

  [Text] A briefing devoted to the Ukrainian-Russian 
negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet issue was held today at the 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. At the negotiations in Sevastopol, 
the Ukrainian delegation proceeded first of all from the 
Ukrainian interests, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan 
Bizhan said at the briefing. During this meeting, he said, it 
was planned that a draft of a relevant agreement would be put 
together and ratified. However, the Russian delegation refused 
to discuss our proposals and failed to show up in the 
negotiation room on 22 April. Over the past two and a half 
years, Ivan Bizhan noted, there were five agreements concluded 
on the Black Sea Fleet. Of those, only one provision was 
actually implemented, the one on appointing the commander in 
chief, even though Ukraine repeatedly came up with specific 
proposals. It is pointless to accuse us of having torpedoed the 
Sevastopol meeting, he emphasized. We were ready for 
constructive talks.

  [Text] These days, the attention of the world community is 
drawn to various appraisals of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant's [AES] technical condition. This is connected with the 
mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], which 
has analyzed the operation of the Chernobyl AES. 
  Participants in an IAEA session discussed the Chernobyl AES 
on 22 April in Vienna. Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shamarov, 
who headed the Ukrainian delegation, spoke on the results of 
this representative meeting with a group of journalists. The 
most important result of the IAEA meeting, he stressed, was the 
opportunity to once again show that our young state is left 
virtually at the mercy of fate in dealing with the aftermath of 
the Chernobyl disaster. Given all its economic difficulties, 
Ukraine has to earmark 14 percent of its budget to handle the 
consequences of the catastrophe. At the same time, we receive 
only humanitarian assistance from Western states. It is 
necessary to urgently resolve the issues of erecting a new shell 
over the unreliable Chernobyl sarcophagus. The cost of the 
project is estimated at $500 million. This issue is much more 
acute than all the discussions of the technical condition of the 
RBMK-type reactor, which was one of the reasons for the initial 
Chernobyl explosion. Analysis indicates that, regardless of all 
technical blunders, these reactors can be modernized. 
Sometimes, emotions make us forget that Ukraine has three such 
reactors and Russia -- 11. Ukrainian representatives also 
voiced their viewpoints on the power engineering system, which 
has no efficient substitute in the foreseeable future. The 
modernization of the entire energy network in Ukraine was also 
discussed. As a rule, IAEA decisions are only of technical 
value, however, they will certainly have an impact on the 
positions of (?leading) Western states during the next 
high-level meeting of their leaders.

  [Text] The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant will not be closed 
down within the next few years, said Ukrainian Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov. 
  He said at a meeting with the plant staff on Tuesday that 
today's campaign for the closure of the plant pursued "above all 
political" aims. 
  However, the Ukrainian leadership "shares the concern of the 
world community over the future of the Chernobyl plant" and 
regards the construction of a reliable shelter above Chernobyl's 
generating unit no. Four and the commissioning of six new units 
at other nuclear plants as priority goals, Shmarov said. 
  He said it would be a firm government policy to increase the 
role of nuclear plants in the country's power industry. 
  Today Ukraine's nuclear plants generate a little over 30 
percent of the country's electricity, but the government might 
increase this proportion due to the shortage of fuel for thermal 
plants. 
  Shmarov said Ukraine had already sent to Russia three 
trainloads of nuclear warheads in fulfillment of a trilateral 
agreement between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the 
United States. As compensation for this, Russia is this year 
due to provide Ukraine with 100 tonnes of nuclear fuel rods. 
  To date Ukraine has received one train with 25 tonnes of 
rods 
for the Zaporozhye plant, Shmarov said. The next shipment of 
fuel is due to arrive this month, he said, quoting Russian 
Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov. 
  Shmarov said the government was planning measures to bolster 
nuclear power engineering and support nuclear plant personnel. 
Thus, it has halved their income tax, is going to raise their 
wages and establish new tariffs for electricity generated by 
nuclear plants, which is today Ukraine's cheapest electricity, 
costing 200 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour. The charges for it 
are to be put up by 150 or 200 percent, which is expected to 
provide enough funds to buy fuel and components in Russia and 
implement safety measures. 
  In winter 1994, units one and three of the Chernobyl plant, 
which are still in operation, produced 13 percent of the 
country's electricity. From the moment the plant was 
commissioned in 1977 to April 1, 1994, it has generated 258.9 
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, including 109 billion 
after the 1986 accident. 
  The funds allocated for safety measures at the Chernobyl 
plant between 1986 and 1993 top one-quarter of the plant's 
initial cost. 
  The plant today has a staff of about 5,000. The town of 
Slavutich, servicing the plant, has a population of about 25,000.

<F P=106> [Interview with I. Kambulov, deputy chairman of "Chernobyl </F>
Assembly," by Andrey Illesh; place and date not given: 
"Chernobyl: "Eliminators And Businessmen"] 
  [Excerpt] Biographical details: Igor Nikolayevich 
Kambulov was born in 1914. A mechanical engineer, he is a 
graduate of the Bauman Higher Technical School in Moscow. He 
worked at Chernobyl in 1986, looking for discharged fuel, 
looking for seepage into the reactor shaft, setting up 
diagnostic equipment amid the ruins of the reactor after it had 
exploded. In 1987-1989 he led the full-scale survey team. As a 
result of the team's work, dozens of holes were bored in places 
where there were concentrations of fuel and it was established 
where the nuclear fuel was, how much there was, and what 
condition it was in, making it possible to arrive at conclusions 
concerning the safety of the nuclear facility (another explosion 
was ruled out). 
  I. Kambulov is currently deputy chairman of the "Chernobyl 
Assembly" association. 
  [Illesh] Igor, your guys were known as "stalkers." It 
sounded highly deferential at the time.... 
  [Kambulov] Mine and the others -- everyone who worked on the 
site near the reactor and inside the sarcophagus (you must 
remember that together they crawled around the entire "Cover" 
structure, from top to bottom) really was respected at the 
station. But once they had left.... 
  ...I would remind you that among our compatriots affected by 
the Chernobyl disaster there is a legal category of citizens who 
participated in the elimination of the consequences of the 
disaster inside the exclusion zone or were involved in 
maintenance or other work at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station. Colloquially they are known as "eliminators." There 
are around 600,000 of them in the country. Why so many? The 
vast majority is made up of those who were connected with the 
construction of the "Cover" structure and the clearing up of the 
nuclear power station site and buildings for the startup of the 
three power units that were still alive. These people had a 
hard time then and life is not sweet even now! The state (in 
the shape of its leaders) made decisions that the obedient 
citizens carried out without asking themselves: Who needs this, 
and why? It is necessary, and that's all there is to it.... 
  [Illesh] But was there any point in sending so many people 
to Chernobyl? 
  [Kambulov] That is just it, there was indeed no need to send 
hundreds of thousands of people to that radioactive garbage pit. 
Certainly, the station had to be shut down right away, you 
cannot put together any kind of "cover" immediately, you have to 
think about it for two-three years (during that time the 
radiation background will have diminished tens of times over), 
and only then begin the requisite work in a calm and organized 
manner. It would have saved so many lives and so many people's 
health. Not to mention money. They would not have had to clear 
away the radioactive garbage with spades and handbarrows, nor 
would have billions been poured into the construction of 
Slavutich, the power workers' city in a cesium blackspot, doomed 
to die, since the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Staiton would close 
anyway. 
  [Illesh] Fine, but build they did, and what did they build? 
  [Kambulov] As for the "sarcophagus" (officially, "Cover"), 
as someone who has studied everything that remains of the fourth 
unit, from top to bottom, I can say that the structure does not 
give anyone much in the way of protection and does not cover 
anything. It was intended to protect the building, mangled by 
explosions and conflagrations, from prying eyes. The "Cover" is 
fine as decoration. But you could read a book inside it -- it 
is so light as a result of a multitude of fissures. The roof is 
riddled with holes. The interchange of air with the environment 
is also in "full working order...." But how they built, how 
they went at it! In the frantic chase for honors there was no 
time to think about human beings, who were sent to the unit in 
their hundreds to do their futile work and get a dose of 
radiation. Criminal case No. 18/926-92 concerning instances of 
misconduct and negligence during the elimination of the 
aftermath of the accident did not come out of nowhere....

  [Text] Kiev April 25 TASS -- "The Chernobyl nuclear plant 
works in a normal mode. As to its safety, it is in a much 
better condition than a year ago," Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said in an exclusive interview with UKRINFORM on Monday. 
  Its safety had been improved due to help on the part of many 
countries of the world, he remarked. 
  "I am aware that international community is concerned about 
the Chernobyl nuclear plant, because it is not a problem of 
Ukraine only," Kravchuk said. 
  "If (foreign countries) want to give us a real help, then 
appropriate funds should be alloted and we should solve the 
Chernobyl problem jointly," he said. 
  "Whatever might be said about the Chernobyl nuclear plant, 
we 
cannot afford to close it down because of energy crisis in 
Ukraine," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Viktor Krokhmalyuk commentary: "Beware: Disinformation!"] </F>
  [Text] KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA published an article by its 
correspondent Olga Musafirova under the title "The Hetman 
[Bohdan Khmelnytskyy] With a Nuclear Mace; There Is No Strength 
To Hold It, and It Is Terrifying To Drop It.... Khmelnytskyy Is 
Agitated by Rumors." Here is a quotation from that publication: 
"At the site near Bohdanivtsi, 20 liquid-fuel SS-18 missiles 
seem to have been disabled and dismantled. There arose some 
problems with the storage of the "liquid," and heptyl, a poison 
of group "S" that is extremely toxic for all living organisms, 
is already poisoning the surrounding woods." 
  In this connection, a news conference was held at Ukraine's 
Security Service Administration in Khmelnytskyy Oblast. 
  What actually happened? Missile specialist Ye. Arkhypov has 
this to say: 
  "Today, about 90 launchers have been taken off the alert -- 
one regiment here and one -- in Pervomaysk. The technology for 
pouring out the liquid fuel is such that no environmental damage 
may occur as a result. It is carried out by the method 
involving high pressure, and, therefore, not a single drop of 
heptyl may get either into the soil or onto the people servicing 
these operations." 
  Colonel Ye. Arkhypov also said that the system of control 
over the course of dangerous operations has a triple and, in 
some cases, fivefold guarantee. Work on servicing missile sites 
is conducted, as usual, according to plan and systematically, 
and specialists from all countries arrive there, so that it 
would hardly be possible to conceal any problems from them. 
  In the near future, Khmelnytskyy missile specialists are 
expecting U.S. ecological safety inspectors; they will see what 
they themselves want to see and not what the Ukrainian side will 
recommend. Therefore, it is unlikely that our missile 
specialists may conceal anything even if they wanted to. 
  As emphasized at the news conference, nuclear fuel is too 
valuable a commodity to export or to sell at a very cheap price 
to CIS countries, in particular, to Russia, as some people are 
suggesting. The fuel remains on site, and then some of it is 
sent to special arsenals for storage and some -- for processing 
at chemical plants. Such a component of propellant fuel as the 
oxidizing agent is a very important product for manufacturing 
mineral fertilizers. Today, we must also think about Ukraine's 
space future. 
  Recently, an accord was signed with Kazakhstan on the joint 
use of Baykonur. We will be able to operate Ukrainian missiles 
with our own fuel instead of paying thousands and millions of 
dollars for this. 
  I will add my personal remark: Even following the 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA material under the provocative title 
"Khmelnytskyy Is Agitated by Rumors," the situation in the town 
is calm, and I did not see any signs of fear, panic, or 
complaints against the missile specialists stationed here.

  [Text] Speaking at a news conference held in Lvov on 25 
April, People's Deputy Yaroslav Kendzior said that after holding 
talks with a number of Ukrainian lawmakers with different 
political views, Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch, and 
President Leonid Kravchuk, he came to the conclusion that 
"presidential elections will, most probably, take place." 
According to Kendzior, Plyushch categorically insists that the 
elections be held in June, while Kravchuk "still cherishes hope 
that the elections will be annulled or postponed." 
  Kendzior also pointed out that since President Kravchuk's 
recent visit to the United States, "certain circles in that 
state have had an interest in him and will help him become 
president of Ukraine."

  [Text] We are ready to conduct a dialog with various 
political forces, both left and right, in the new parliament, 
former Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma stated. At a 
press conference devoted to problems related to forging a 
parliamentary faction of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms 
[MBR], he said he is ready to cooperate with all parties and 
movements, but only on issues of mutual interest. In this case, 
Leonid Kuchma noted, I do not rule out negotiations with 
Vyacheslav Chornovil. In the recent election, the former prime 
minister said, those who bet on Ukraine's self- isolation 
failed. Speaking on the country's economic situation, the MBR 
leader noted that the West is right in calling Ukraine Central 
European Columbia. Without privatization and the complete 
restructuring of the country's economy, Western capital will not 
come to us. The United States of America, Leonid Kuchma said, 
will not give Ukraine a penny until it makes sure that Ukrainian 
economy is stable and receives guarantees for the capital 
invested into it.

  [Text] The former speaker of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, 
Ivan Plyushch, has the biggest chance to win the 1994 
presidential elections in the republic, the former prime 
minister, leader of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms (IBR), 
Leonid Kuchma, told a news conference in Kiev Tuesday. In his 
opinion, Plyushch "is holding all power in Ukraine." 
  Asked about the possibility of the new parliament's 
cancelling the presidential elections scheduled for June 26 
1994, Kuchma noted: "It would be desirable if we started to 
respect laws we have passed." In his opinion, the new 
parliament should not start its work with cancelling decisions 
made by its predecessor. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has been insisting on 
cancelling the previous parliament's decision to hold the 
presidential elections on June 26. 
  At the same time, Kuchma said he saw postponing the 
elections 
as no tragedy. The candidates should possess "a plan of 
specific activities instead of the desire to prolong the agony 
of the country's economy as a whole." 
  The former prime minister pointed out that it would be more 
favorable for him as a candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, 
if Kravchuk took part in the elections, which would considerably 
reduce Plyushch's chances. 
  Kuchma pointed to the need to adopt tough measures to 
surmount the economic crisis. In his opinion, Ukraine's economy 
saw a state of emergency on the brink of a disaster. 
  The parliamentary faction of the IBR created at a party 
meeting Tuesday consists of 21 deputies and is called 
Interregional Deputies' Faction Center. Its first meeting was 
scheduled for May 5.

  [Text] Communist party chief in Lvov Aleksandr Golub says 
Ukrainian communists will throw their weight behind any 
left-wing candidate for the presidency who will agree to become 
the country's last president. 
  In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, he said the 
institution of presidency for Ukraine was both alien and 
ineffective because of historical traditions and polarization 
between the eastern and western parts of the country. 
  He said the communist party had won more than ten million 
votes in the recent elections, an indication that "the left-wing 
forces are back in the country's political life for good." At 
the same time, Golub said the left groups which had not counted 
on winning a third of parliamentary seats were seeing their 
success as a sign of credibility on the ground. 
  Communist deputies will be working hard to try to stabilize 
the economy and carry out tax and price reforms, he said. 
  Golub blamed the country's economic and cultural setbacks on 
policies carried out by the regime of President Kravchuk propped 
up by nationalist-minded democrats and aimed to build up a 
capitalist society run by bureaucrats and criminal circles. 
  He described the new parliament as a body of seasoned 
technocrats and politicians rather than that of saviours of the 
nation or backyard prophets.

<F P=106> [Comment by Volodymyr Sumin, chairman of the Association of </F>
Ukrainian Lawyers: "Election of Hrynyov, Kudyukin, and Some 
Other Newly Elected Deputies Should Be Declared Invalid"] 
  [Text] Before going down in history (if not into 
oblivion), the "old" parliament will laud itself at its last 
meeting this evening in a bid to gain moral satisfaction. As to 
material satisfaction, each of the people's servants did his 
best to get it in accordance with his own efforts and perceived 
needs during his time in office. However, in addition to the 
barrel loads of praise which the former deputies will 
undoubtedly heap upon each other, several urgent matters are 
awaiting the deputies. In particular, despite their present 
state of relaxation, they will have to confront numerous reports 
on violation of the Electoral Law, which they themselves passed. 
Specifically, these were cases of elections with only a single 
candidate contesting--only one candidate running--in four 
districts. In each of them, there were ten or more contenders 
running in the first round. Here is how Volodymyr Sumin, 
chairman of the Association of Ukrainian Lawyers, comments on 
this issue. 
  [Sumin] Of course, it is strange that certified lawyers from 
the Central Election Commission deliberately -- because that's 
how it was -- violated the law. Not only does Ivan Yemets, head 
of the commission, take the liberty of bending the law, he also 
claims that it is absolutely right to do so. The law clearly 
states that the elections must be held with more than one 
candidate. I agree, somebody can die or withdraw his candidacy. 
In this case, however, the next best-rated candidate is 
proposed. We are not talking about districts where only one 
candidate was put forward -- there were none during this 
election. Instead, there were four districts, where one of the 
two candidates decided not to run for parliament in the second 
round, and so the election was held without an opponent. Our 
position is that a repeat election must be called in each of 
those districts, and that the "victors" should also participate, 
because technically, it is not their fault that they remained 
alone in the second round. It is the fault of the commission, 
and a repeat election must be held. Thus, the four newly 
elected deputies, including Volodymyr Hrynyov, head of the 
"Blasko" joint stock company, Pavlo Kudyukin, and others will 
have to prove their right to sit in parliament once again. 
  I hope that the Supreme Council, which will hold its last 
meeting on 22 April, will correct the commission and its 
chairman's mistake; perhaps, it might even assess the actions of 
Ivan Yemets. I feel sorry for Ivan Yemets, who has worked all 
his life in the [state] apparatus and became its servant. 
Obviously, he performed some function in this apparatus, but no 
lawyer can act this way. There is no reason for Ivan Yemets to 
charge the Association of Ukrainian Lawyers with interfering in 
the election procedure. On the contrary, we helped him with our 
analysis and expertise on the violations reported by the people 
as well as by parliamentary candidates, and which we also 
witnessed ourselves. Analyzing the reaction of the commission 
and its head, one gets the feeling that the law was violated to 
please someone or something, not because of any lack of 
knowledge.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Socialists Sacrifice Their </F>
Positions. For the Sake of the State"] 
  [Text] At the news conference in Kiev, leaders of 
Ukraine's Socialist Party were not as confident as Communists, 
but they did not look too depressed either, as, according to 
them, they had received 15 mandates in the parliament. Moreover, 
leader of Ukraine's Socialist Party and twice [dvichi] deputy O. 
Moroz stated that the party had been faced with two variants of 
choosing their further fate. First, a variant that would be 
advantageous for the party, which does not have a single 
representative in the power structures and may, therefore, 
quietly assume tough opposition to the present authorities that 
have nothing much to be proud of. However, the Fourth 
Extraordinary Congress of Ukraine's Socialist Party voted for 
the other unremunerative variant in accordance with which the 
party, for the sake of building the state and preventing the 
economic collapse, will seek contacts with all political forces 
capable of constructive compromise. 
  In O. Moroz's opinion, the main result of the elections is 
an 
open regionalization of our society in terms of political 
convictions: The west -- in favor of Nationalists and National 
Democrats; and the east, center, and south -- mainly supporting 
left-wingers. "Not a single presidential candidate can bring 
all of these moods to agreement," said O. Moroz and acknowledged 
the fact that National Democrats (Rukh [Ukraine's People's 
Movement for Perestroyka] and the Ukrainian Republican Party) 
are also worried by the radicalization of the right-wing center. 
O. Moroz tactfully failed to note that the same had happened to 
the left-wing center. Nominated as a presidential candidate, O. 
Moroz openly said this about his goals: "If we win, we will 
implement the program of the Socialist Party. We will build an 
independent and strong democratic state with a socially oriented 
economy. We will build a people's democratic republic." He 
also pointed out that Socialists were not against privatization 
in general, but that they protested against its today's 
antipeople variant, which does not promote economic efficiency, 
but enriches a small group of dodgers.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mykola Slyusarevskyy, director of the </F>
Scientific-Practical Center of Political Psychology at Ukraine's 
Academy of Pedagogical Sciences, and Vadym Vasyutynskyy, head of 
the Laboratory for the Psychology of Masses and Organizations: 
"KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA `Experts' Are Free From Truth"] 
  [Text] KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has published a bewildering 
article by "an independent expert group" under the expressive 
title "`Probable' Plans of Improbable Enemy." This probable 
enemy of Russia is, as it turns out, Ukraine. 
  Since the article mentions our center and refers to the 
results of our "secret" (classified) sociological research, we 
want to clarify some points and make the "secret" open. 
  Thus, the Scientific-Practical Center of Political 
Psychology 
at Ukraine's Academy of Pedagogical Sciences (until quite 
recently, it was attached to the Institute of the Psychology at 
this Academy) has actually prepared and conducted a large-scale 
poll among Ukraine's citizens living in different regions of the 
country. From the very beginning, this research was not secret. 
The preliminary and final results (not all, because even up to 
now they have not been analyzed in full) were many times 
publicized in the media (in the press and on the radio) and 
presented at a scientific conference. In addition, the research 
was carried out on our own initiative, according to plans of 
scientific work, and not as "Kravchuk's assignment", as it was 
stated for some reasons by the authors of the KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA article. 
  We were amazed by the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA passage stating 
that from 50 to 80 percent of population in Ukraine's southern 
and eastern regions "support unification with Russia or transfer 
to Russia's jurisdiction." 
  In fact, the direct question whether Ukraine should be 
independent was answered in the affirmative by 60.5 percent, 
with 18.4 percent undecided, and 21.1 percent opposed. These 
results come from the entire Ukraine. 
  In three eastern oblasts (without Donbass) -- 
Dnipropetrovska 
[Dnepropetskov], Zaporizka, and Kharkivska, 49.2 percent of 
votes supported the independence, 18.5 percent were undecided, 
and 32.3 percent were opposed. In two Donbass oblasts -- 
Donetska [Donetsk] and Luhanska, the vote distribution was 40 
percent, 22.9 percent, and 37.1 percent respectively. In the 
southern oblasts -- Mykolayivska, Odesska, and Khersonska, the 
support for Ukraine's independent status proved to be still more 
stronger: 52 percent voted "yes", 23. 5 percent remained 
undecided, and 24.5 percent voted "no." Even in the Crimea, the 
situation does not looks as it was presented by the authors of 
"independent expertise" -- Ukraine's independence was accepted 
by 37 percent of those polled and opposed by 31.5 percent, while 
31.5 percent remained undecided. 
  We would draw attention of these respected "experts" to one 
more fact. The idea that Ukraine will overcome its crisis only 
if it is divided into federal lands (here is a suitable 
opportunity for the transfers to Russia's jurisdiction!) was 
accepted by 8.9 percent of those polled throughout Ukraine. 
  Now, we will present the responses of residents of those 
regions which "are striving to escape Ukraine for Russia." In 
the three eastern oblast, this opinion was accepted by 16.9 
percent of citizens (unaccepted by 46.9 percent); in Donbass -- 
12.1 (51.7); in the south -- 6.9 (62.8); and in the Crimea -- 
3.7 (53.7). Thus, even if the Crimean sticks by to its poll 
results, it is not the way, in which some would like to do. 
  Still, from where have our unknown "colleagues" collected 
such "interesting" data? It is possible that they interpreted 
-- in their original way -- the fact that Ukraine's 
participation in the CIS economic union was supported by 58.4 
percent of those polled, in particular, in the east -- 69.8 
percent, in Donbass -- 83.2 percent, in the south -- 74.8 
percent, and in the Crimea -- 81.5 percent. If one identified 
the CIS with "the single and indivisible" [Russia -- words in 
quotation marks in Russian], one would conclude that not only 
the south and east, but entire Ukraine is striving to embrace 
"elder brother," whereas the referendum on 1 December 1991 was 
only an unpleasant misunderstanding. Is this not the point of 
which KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA "independent experts" were trying to 
convince us?

<F P=106> [Report by UNIAN correspondent Volodymyr Teteruk: </F>
"Ukrainian Army Is More Reliable Than Its Economy"] 
  [Text] After the signing of the trilateral declaration by 
the Russian, U.S., and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow in January 
1994, the foreign policy gap between Washington and Kiev has 
been lessened primarily due to Ukraine observing its 
commitments. However aside from compensation for nuclear arms 
removed from our territory -- $175 million -- the United States 
is going to earmark another $10 million for the creation in Kiev 
of an international scientific center that would employ 
scientists who used to work in defense industries. According to 
U.S. experts, Ukraine should receive some $1 billion for the 
weapons-grade uranium extracted from nuclear warheads. 
  However, it is too early to speak of direct economic 
assistance for our state, that is investments, the sponsoring of 
foreign trade, and so on. People from U.S. financial and 
business circles prefer a reserved stance regarding investments 
in the Ukrainian economy. Inflation, the absence of market 
infrastructure and mechanisms to protect investments make 
Ukraine unattractive for businessmen. 
  U.S. experts link economic chaos in Ukraine to the current 
leadership's inability to resolve economic issues. Analyzing 
the results of Ukrainian legislative elections, a correspondent 
of the influential THE NEW YORK TIMES in particular points out: 
"Mr. Kravchuk used to talk about reform a lot, but he did 
nothing to implement it. At the same time, he kept criticizing 
the former legislature for hampering his efforts." Similar 
skeptical remarks about the activities of Leonid Kravchuk and 
his team in the economic sphere, however, are fully compensated 
in the sphere of foreign policy. 
  In the opinion of the West, the Ukrainian head of state 
reaped dividends by signing the tripartite declaration. 
Ukraine's gradual nuclear disarmament and access to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty is now connected with the name of 
Kravchuk. For the United States, this issue is much more actual 
than problems of the Ukrainian economy. That is why Kravchuk, 
despite his inability to carry out economic reform, has become 
very popular with Americans due to the service he paid to the 
United States. Washington understands perfectly well that under 
the current Ukrainian Administration, economic changes in our 
state will have to wait. That is why there are attempts to limit 
U.S.-Ukrainian relations to those areas that can yield much more 
than risky investment in our economy. One such sphere concerns 
the military, where U.S. interests are being gradually shifted 
from Russia toward Ukraine. The primary reason for this is 
probably official Kiev's consent to disarm, as opposed to the 
ever growing aggressiveness of Moscow's foreign policy and 
attempts to enter the superpowers' club. 
  The United States and NATO are currently concerned over the 
concentration of Russian forces pulled out from Central and East 
Europe along Russia's southern (the northern Caucasian military 
district) and northern (the Leningrad military district) 
borders. Under the provisions of the Treaty on the Reduction of 
Conventional Arms in Europe signed in 1990, Russia is to reduce 
its hardware so that by November 1995, 580 armored vehicles, 700 
tanks, and 1,280 artillery pieces remain in each of these 
districts. 
  According to U.S. analysts, however, Russia is very 
sluggishly reducing its arms and by the deadline in 1995 will 
still have a surplus 2,000 armored vehicles, 400 tanks, and 500 
artillery pieces. Russia's desire to concentrate a large amount 
of hardware along its borders is no secret. During the March 
conference between U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and 
Russian Army Chief of Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov in Moscow, the 
Russian general directly stated that it is necessary to review 
the quotas of arms stipulated by the treaty. 
  At any rate, until November 1995 Russia has the legal right 
to keep unlimited amounts of arms along its borders, despite 
negative reactions by Turkey, Norway, and other NATO members. 
  In this situation, the United States may display interest in 
Ukraine as a possible "buffer zone" between Russia and East 
Europe. The Partnership for Peace project, to which Ukraine has 
acceded, envisions joint maneuvers and at the same time does not 
bind NATO's hands with commitments. 
  In light of the current realities, future U.S.-Ukrainian 
relations will hardly cross the framework of military 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS--Boris Yeltsin's decision to 
look into the problem of the expediency of Russo-US military 
exercises planned to be conducted in the Orenburg region might 
negatively affect the relations between the two countries, said 
presidential aide for issues of national security, Yuriy 
Baturin, in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. "However, 
Americans are sensible enough, they know how talks should be 
conducted and it is possible to come to terms with them on all 
positions," Baturin said. 
  He said that Yeltsin's attitude to the problem was 
influenced 
by numerous requests made by deputies of the State Duma to look 
into the matter and, for the last time, such a request was made 
by the Duma council. The president received protests from the 
Orenburg region, where the exercises were scheduled to take 
place. As a result, Yeltsin decided to look into the matter 
again, Baturin said. 
  Asked about unjustified expenditures in connection with 
preparations for the exercises, Baturin said that the 
"involvement of military units had not been envisaged. There 
were plans that the exercises would be held by a limited number 
of Russian and U.S. officers and generals with the help of maps 
and computers, Baturin said. In his opinion, the material cost 
of the exercises, unlike the political cost, is not big at all.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- Vyacheslav Kostikov, press 
secretary of the Russian president, has assessed Boris Yeltsin's 
decision to heed the State Duma's view on joint Russian-U.S. 
exercises and the proposal to hold additional consultations on 
this issue between the Russian and U.S. military departments as 
a normal and specific fact of interaction with other democratic 
institutions of power. 
  This step, he said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS 
today, was dictated not by Boris Yeltsin's concessions to 
"certain circles," and even less by any colder attitude on the 
part of the Russian leadership to the United States, as some 
analysts maintain, but by the striving to adopt such foreign and 
domestic political decisions as would promote the strengthening 
of civic accord. 
  "No one voices any surprise," Vyacheslav Kostikov remarked, 
"when U.S. presidents take into account the Congress' opinion or 
the views of influential politicians before adopting this or 
that decision. This is an absolutely normal procedure of 
democratic interaction, and the fact that it is making way for 
itself in Russia, replacing the voluntarist decisions of the 
past, is a positive phenomenon showing a more mature and 
democratic decision-making process in conditions of pluralism." 
  In Vyacheslav Kostikov's view, one can admit that the 
decisions taken through such a procedure can be more or less 
successful or timely. However, he stressed, "it is beyond doubt 
that they are a norm of the democratic process with all the 
ensuing positive and negative consequences." 
  As is known, the agreement on holding joint Russian-U.S. 
exercises at the Totsk testing range in Orenburg oblast in July 
was reached by the Russian and U.S. foreign ministers. The 
exercise was to practise interaction between peacekeeping 
subunits of the two military departments.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- If the Russian military needs to 
hold tactical exercises in the interests of boosting the combat 
readiness of the troops, it should be allowed to hold them. 
Politicians should react calmly to what the military do in the 
interests of enhancing combat training. This is the opinion of 
Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  Today in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent he stressed that every politician should strive to 
enhance the army's combat readiness and for this every means is 
important, including the possibility of cooperating with another 
army. That is why he believes it is expedient to hold 
Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises at the Totsk training 
ground in Orenburg oblast. 
  Answering to those opposing the exercises, who are indignant 
that "Yankee feet should step" on Russian soil, Vladimir 
Shumeyko said that in this case "not an aggressor, but an ally 
is stepping on our soil."

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and U.S. 
Defense secretary William Perry approved of the idea of holding 
a meeting between the leaders of Russia, the U.S., NATO and 
other parties concerned with the settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia during their telephone conversation today. The 
conversation was initiated by the U.S. 
  An aide of the Russian Defense Minister, Yelena Agapova, 
told 
Interfax that Grachev had confirmed his position on NATO air 
attacks against the Serb positions in Gorazde considering them 
unreasonable. Grachev stressed that the civilian population 
would suffer the most during such actions. 
  Grachev put forward several proposals concerning a 
settlement 
in Bosnia. In particular, he considered it necessary to refrain 
from any more air attacks since this could make the conflict 
uncontrollable and lead to a deterioration in the situation. 
  Grachev proposed to strengthen the UN peacekeeping 
contingency in Gorazde and to take measures in order to prevent 
arms deliveries to the conflicting parties. He emphasized that 
the population must be regularly provided with humanitarian aid.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- Urgent measures are needed to 
establish a clearcut definition of the borders and 
characteristics of the UN-declared safe areas in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to bring about their 
demilitarization. This point of view was expressed at a 
briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information 
and press department of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Such 
measures, he stressed, can only be drafted within the framework 
of the UN Security Council. "Unilateral decisions in this 
respect will be counterproductive," the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman stated. 
  In his view, the normalization of the situation around 
Gorazde creates conditions for the resumption of efforts to 
achieve a political settlement of the Bosnian problem. As G. 
Karasin pointed out, this was the purpose of the contacts made 
by Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister, in London, 
today's meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and other 
Russian diplomatic moves toward the implementation of the 
Russian president's initiative. 
  According to the Russian diplomat, it was noted at 
yesterday's consultative meeting of the UN Security Council that 
"the Muslims were responsible for a provocation in the Gorazde 
area, but the Serbs did not respond to it." In this connection 
Russia again called on the UN leadership and the countries 
involved in the Bosnian settlement process to take all measures 
necessary to prevent provocations.

  [Text] Geneva April 26 TASS -- "The Bosnian crisis may be 
settled only through political way," Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev told a press conference on Tuesday. 
  He arrived in Geneva to hold a working meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  The work on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis is holding 
in close contacts with partners, Kozyrev said. [sentence as 
received] He paid attention to "close and common approaches to 
political solutions." "All our work is the preparatory stage of 
the summit meeting which, according to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, should lead to the end of the conflict," Kozyrev noted. 
  Warren Christopher called the meeting "very fruitful" and 
paid attention to "common goals" of partners in Bosnia. He said 
that the two sides discussed "ways of the diplomatic solution of 
the conflict." 
  The United States recognised the importance of the creation 
of the group with participation of Russia, the United States, 
the European Union and the United Nations. The goal of the 
group is to gather conflicting sides at negotiating table, the 
U.S. secretary of state stressed.

is the main subject of discussion at a current working meeting

talks between the foreign ministers of Russia and France are 
being held in the United Nations office in Europe. 
  Russian diplomats are of the opinion that the positions of 
the two countries on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia are 
close on a number of important points. Moscow and Paris favour 
close cooperative action among Russia, the United States, the 
European Union, and the United Nations in the quest for a 
resolution of the crisis. It was in many respects due to this 
policy line that the four-country contact group was set up.

  GENEVA, 27 Apr -- Russia and France believe that a 
quadripartite meeting of ministers from the Russian Federation, 
the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations 
could be held in the very near future. This was announced here 
by Andrey Kozyrev and Alain Juppe after they had held an hour 
and a half of talks. 
  The opportunity for real cooperation is now better than ever 
before, the Russian minister told journalists. It is now 
extremely important to take this opportunity. The contact group 
which the four have set up to prepare a full report on the 
situation as regarding a Bosnian settlement could now be given 
one week rather than two. This would "avoid missing the chance 
for positive development" and make it possible to move on to 
ministerial talks on preparation of a summit meeting. 
  Speaking after his Russian counterpart, Juppe recalled that 
France supports the idea of a "summit" on Bosnia. He said that 
agreement could be reached quite quickly on the venue and date 
for the ministerial discussions. It is important that the 
contact group work correspondingly fast, he said.

but the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, the

the Bosnian problem without the involvement of the conflicting 
parties." Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said this 
today at a news conference which was held after his consultative 
meeting with Germany's Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
"It seems to me," he added, "that the important thing now is for 
Russia, the United States, the EU, and the UN to work out a 
coordinated approach." 
  This is necessary in order to make the conflicting parties 
in Bosnia aware that there is a reasonable alternative to war, 
and that they will not succeed in playing on differences between 
various states. "It should be clear to the conflicting sides in 
Bosnia that it is no longer possible for them to play the game 
in which one side or another puts forward deliberately 
unacceptable demands -- for instance, as regards territory. 
That will not work," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] The latest developments in the Balkans in the region 
of Gorazde showed "the extreme unskillfulness of American 
diplomacy, its impulsiveness and high dependence on internal 
political changes," Chairman of the parliamentary committee for 
international relations Vladimir Lukin told a briefing in the 
State Duma. 
  Lukin also pointed to "the weakness and dissociation of the 
Russian policy both at the inter-ministerial level, and at the 
level of interaction between the Foreign Ministry and the 
presidential administration. Our diplomacy decided to exert 
pressure on the Serbs in a rougher way, using a personal 
factor," he noted. 
  In Lukin's opinion, this factor lies in "the halo of heroism 
around two successful trips by our leaders to the Balkans," 
created by the media, having in view Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and his deputy, representative of the Russian president 
in former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin. Such coverage of the 
trips, he said, led to the fact that "the mission of our leading 
diplomat turned out to be counter-productive." 
  Lukin pointed out that neither Russia, nor the West in 
isolation can handle the situation in the Balkans and they 
should act in coordination with each other. 
  Lukin said that upon return of the parliamentary delegation 
from former Yugoslavia, his committee intends to work out 
recommendations for the president on adjustment of the policy 
toward the Balkans. He noted that these recommendations "will 
also concern the gradual lifting of sanctions against republics 
of former Yugoslavia if they fulfil certain conditions."

  [Text] Geneva, 27 Apr -- An ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
been told by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special 
envoy to former Yugoslavia, that a contact group set up by 
Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United 
Nations to coordinate diplomatic efforts in the Bosnian 
settlement is being sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Russia is 
represented in the group by Foreign Ministry representative 
Aleksey Nikiforov. 
  The group is to meet the leaders of the warring sides to 
look 
into their readiness to conclude an agreement on an all-round 
cease-fire between the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslims. Churkin 
noted that the conclusion of the agreement would be an important 
step towards a comprehensive settlement. 
  For the time being though, despite a relatively "quiet" 
night 
after the expiration of the NATO deadline for pulling back heavy 
weapons from Gorazde, the diplomat believes that the situation 
remains difficult and requires unremitting attention.

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Minister's Deputy Vitaliy 
Churkin will continue to serve as the president's special envoy 
in former Yugoslavia in the near future. This was reported in 
an interview with Interfax on Thursday by the Ministry's 
Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin. 
  He recalled that at their meeting on Bosnia in London on 
Tuesday [26 April], experts from Russia, US, EU, and UN had 
decided to set up a contact group for work with the conflicting 
parties. "This tallies with the plan suggested by Russia of 
further joint steps. This design provides for work at expert 
level to pave the way for a meeting between the foreign 
ministers of Russia, US, and EC countries, and subsequently for 
a summit on a Bosnian settlement," Karasin said. 
  In his words, such a contact group is already at work. 
Russia is represented in it by the First Deputy Director of the 
Foreign Ministry's European Department Alexey Nikiforov, the 
United States by the President's Special Envoy Charles Redman. 
Other participants in the contact will be represented at the 
same level. 
  According to Karasin, Nikiforov will take over from Churkin 
the bulk of technical work. Churkin will be called in only for 
crucial decisions, Karasin explained. 
  In the words of yet another senior Russian diplomat, 
Churkin, 
who is known as the "Moscow shuttle" abroad, will still be 
responsible for events in Yugoslavia at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry but will apparently scale down his trips abroad.

<F P=106> [Georgiy Bovt, Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Andrey </F>
Kozyrev's European Tour. Vitaliy Churkin Retires From Bosnia 
Affairs?"] 
  [Excerpt] In yesterday's talks with Andrey Kozyrev, his 
French counterpart Allain Juppe backed the idea for a summit 
with Russia, the EC, the United Nations, and the United States 
taking part (this idea was approved in a telephone conversation 
the day before by Pavel Grachev and Pentagon chief William 
Perry). A conference of the heads of interested countries' 
Foreign Ministries is to get down to preparing the summit. 
  The ministers' conference, Kozyrev and Juppe thought, could 
discuss the report of the "contact group" which is starting 
talks with the Serbs and Muslims. In the meantime, Vitaliy 
Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, indicated 
yesterday that he was not going to play the leading role in this 
group (although it is made up of his "counterparts in the 
settlement" -- for example, U.S. special envoy Charles Redman) 
and would only "from time to time" participate in its work. 
Churkin's place in the group will be taken by Aleksey 
Nikiforov, a diplomat expert in Balkan affairs. Time will tell 
whether this is really a quiet removal of Churkin from a 
Yugoslav settlement (in a sequel to the two-week-old story where 
he first sharply criticized a part of the Bosnian Serbs for 
"extremism," and then rumors of his certain "differences with 
Kozyrev" began to creep around Moscow). For the time being, 
Churkin will be busy preparing Russia's signing of the 
"Partnership for Peace" with NATO. Aleksey Nikiforov earlier 
worked in the USSR Embassy in Belgrade, then in the East 
European department of the Foreign Ministry, and took part in 
the early stages of the Geneva talks on ex-Yugoslavia. [passage

  [Text] Vyacheslav Grunskiy has told us that, last night 
Bosnian Muslims seized two Russian servicemen from the UN 
peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia at checkpoint No. 6 of the 
Russian battalion in Sarajevo, which is on the dividing line 
between the conflicting sides. They are Private Potapov and 
Sergeant Vlasov. 
  As the Bosnian side has breached the statutes on the 
peacekeeping forces, the commander of the Russian UN forces in 
Bosnia has sent a note of protest to the Bosnian military 
leadership. At present the Russian servicemen are effectively 
the prisoners of the Bosnian Muslims.

  Thanks to prompt measures taken by commanders of the Russian

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 27 Apr -- Our trip to the republics of 
former Yugoslavia has reinforced the view of all members of the 
delegation that the issue of revoking sanctions against the FRY 
should be raised in the Duma. We realize that our parliament is 
not the final level of authority, that this matter has to be 
settled at the United Nations and that its settlement will be 
bound up with many difficulties, but Russia is duty-bound to 
press for this. Our whole delegation, which represents the 
majority of parliamentary factions, is unanimous on that, 
Nikolay Bosborodov, deputy chairman of the defense committee and 
head of the parliamentary delegation of the Russian State Duma, 
said in an interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  The issue of sanctions, he continued, is closely bound up 
with an overall political settlement of the conflict. The Duma 
has already adopted a decision on holding hearings on this 
matter, and representatives of all the republics of former 
Yugoslavia are invited. Undoubtedly serious preparations need 
to be made for such hearings and many issues need to be worked 
through, but the discussion could represent very promising 
assistance in unravelling the Yugoslav knot. 
  The head of the Russian parliamentary delegation voiced his 
distress and surprise at recent statements made by various 
Russian diplomats during the delegation's visit. "We do not 
understand their consent to NATO ultimatums to the Bosnian 
Serbs. It is obvious that NATO's intervention in the Bosnian 
conflict can only exacerbate the ferocity of the warring sides 
and expand the war area, and that it threatens to draw 
Yugoslavia into the war. On this matter we support the stance 
of the Russian defense minister," the head of the Russian 
delegation said. 
  Moreover, Bosborodov said, when we were talking to the 
commander of the Russian blue helmets battalion and asked him 
what help was needed above all, the commander asked for one 
thing only: "for the Foreign Ministry not to change its stance 
every day."

  [Text] A Russian paratroopers platoon from among the UN 
peace-keeping force in the former Yugoslavia was airlifted on 
the night of April 24 from Sarajevo to the Gorazde enclave. It 
consists of 19 paratroopers, three armored personnel carriers, 
two Ural motor vehicles and a radio station. The statement was 
made to INTERFAX on Tuesday by the commander of the Russian 
Airborne Troops, General Yevgeny Podkolzin. 
  According to him, British General Michael Rose, the 
commander 
of the UN peace-keeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, asked for 
the redeployment of the Russian unit. The airlift of 
paratroopers was made to enforce the peace-keeping contingent in 
the area of Gorazde. Earlier other peace-keepers units, 
including a Ukrainian company, were deployed in the region. 
  Podkolzin believes that the airlift of Russian paratroopers 
will affect beneficially the situation in the region, as well as 
Bosnian Serb units. He also said that the Russian diplomacy 
will only benefit from the presence of Russian troops in Gorazde. 
  The commander said that the rotation of the Russian 
peace-keeping contingent in the former Yugoslavia will end on 
April 29. As many as 600, out of the 1500 Russian contingent, 
will be replaced by fresh forces. 
  Podkolsin said that most soldiers and sergeants who had 
served for six months in line with the contract, acquired cars 
in the former Yugoslavia. They received 6,000 dollars for their 
peace-keeping work and most have decided to return to Russia 
behind the wheel of their own car.

<F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondent Andrey Kulikov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- Today at a news conference at the 
Center for Public Relations of the Russian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, those who returned from Zagreb on 25 April spoke about 
the work of the Russian police mission in Yugoslavia. 
  The news conference noted that the first group of Russian 
police observers, numbering 14 people, was sent to Yugoslavia in 
April 1992 at the request of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
Russian militiamen were working as part of the UN police 
forces, who perform peacekeeping functions. The tasks of these 
forces include monitoring the observance of human rights by the 
local police and the distribution of humanitarian aid. The 
staff of the police forces also undertook the organization of 
exchanges of POWs. 
  The second group of militiamen went to Yugoslavia a year 
ago. 
Anatoliy Tsoglo, the commander of the Russian police contingent, 
informed a CRIME-PRESS correspondent that our militiamen were 
serving in all sectors of the UN police mission, including those 
in areas with an extremely exacerbated military situation, such 
as Sarajevo and Tuzla. According to Colonel (militia) Boris 
Rakitin, deputy commander of the contingent, the group of 
observers working in the area of Sarajevo airport, where there 
was practically no local police, had the hardest time. The 
Russian contingent was involved in the evacuation of sick and 
wounded from the area of Sarajevo. 
  According to Anatoliy Tsoglo, Russian militiamen enjoy high 
prestige both among the local population and among their 
colleagues from other countries. Twenty-six people from the 
staff of the mission (altogether it has 41 people) are occupying 
leading posts in the structure of the UN police forces. 
  The next group of Russian police observers is now getting 
ready to be dispatched to Yugoslavia.

  [Text] "There cannot be steady peace in Europe without 
Russia," the chairman of the North Atlantic Assembly, Loic 
Bouvard, said in Moscow Wednesday. A NATO parliamentary 
delegation headed by Bouvard was received by Federation Council 
Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko Wednesday. 
  According to Bouvard, Russian deputies' controversial 
attitude to Russia's joining the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program was mainly explained by the internal situation in the 
country rather than foreign policy matters. 
  At the same time, Shumeyko said that Russian politicians' 
speculation about and attitude to the subject were mainly caused 
by insufficient and incorrect information. 
  "In addition, this issue is psychologically difficult for 
citizens of Russia as until very recently the NATO alliance was 
enemy No.1 for many," Shumeyko was quoted as saying. 
  Nevertheless, "the issue is on the way to resolution," 
Shumeyko said.

  [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- Chairman of the North 
Atlantic Assembly of the NATO Parliament, Loic Bouvard, said at 
a meeting with the Chairman of the Russian Federation [title as 
received], Vladimir Shumeyko, on Wednesday that lasting peace in 
Europe is impossible without Russia. 
  Bouvard pointed out that during his visit to Russia and 
meetings with Russian lawmakers he realised that the attitude of 
Russian parliamentarians to the Partnership for Peace Programme 
was not unequivocal. In his opinion, this can be accounted for 
by internal, rather than external political reasons. Bouvard 
pointed out that he was prepared to explain the situation in the 
NATO Parliament. 
  The speaker of the Federation Council believes that the 
attitude to this problem in Russia and, in particular, 
statements made by politicians depend on the availability of 
information. Shumeyko suggested that the lack of information 
about developments in Yugoslavia affected the attitude of the 
Russian people. Shumeyko pointed out that many people find the 
problem of joining the NATO programme difficult because only 
yesterday, NATO was Russia's adversary. "However, this problem 
is in the process of settlement," Shumeyko said.

provided Armenia makes the same decision, Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev said after the talks with Rasul Guliyev, 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, on Tuesday evening. 
  Pavel Grachev also told journalists that he would 
immediately 
inform the Armenian side of this decision and counted on mutual 
understanding. 
  According to the Russian defense minister, during the talks 
both sides also discussed some issues concerning putting under 
Russian control of the Gabelin radar station which has great 
importance for all Commonwealth countries. These issues will be 
resolved at the inter-governmental level, the minister stressed. 
  It was almost impossible to foresee such an outcome of the 
talks between the Russian defense minister and the head of the 
Azeri Parliament. After all, the talks began from Pavel 
Grachev's statement that the February 18 agreement on cease-fire 
in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, reached between 
defense minister of these two republics through the mediation of 
the Russian minister was, to put it mildly, ignored, and did not 
bring expected results. 
  At the same time, the minister said, Russia continues 
intermediary efforts offering its version of cessation of the 
armed conflict and transition to the elimination of its 
consequences. According to Pavel Grachev, this version was 
considered at the expert level at the end of March during a 
meeting in Moscow with the participation of representatives of 
the conflicting sides and, for the first time, the Minsk group 
of Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
The Russian defense minister also believes that this project 
corresponds to the current situation, takes into account the 
interests of both sides, and it is desirable that they consider 
it. "We think that this would allow to essentially advance in 
the settlement of the conflict," Pavel Grachev noted. 
  As for the problems of functioning of the mechanism for 
control over the implementation of the Russian initiatives, the 
minister said, both sides should establish joint headquarters. 
  Before the cease-fire in the zone of the conflict the 
minister proposes to check up controllability of all armed 
units, first of all stationed on the line of contact. 
Uncontrolled military units should be moved to the rear, 
forcibly disarmed and disbanded. 
  After the cessation of fire, combat operations and 
disengagement of forces, Pavel Grachev believes, it is necessary 
to create a mutual security zone. Joint headquarters, if they 
are set up, should establish control over both sides' actions 
and set up observation posts. Control over the withdrawal of 
forces will be carried out by observers from the Commonwealth 
countries and the Conference for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  According to Pavel Grachev, he proposed to the Azeri side to 
bring Russian troops to the line of contact and agreed that 
these must be military units not stationed in Armenia. The 
disengagement will be carried out stage-by-stage. 
  In accordance with the russian plan of the settlement of the 
conflict, Armenian armed units must liberate all earlier seized 
Azeri territories and return to Nagorno-Karabakh. If both sides 
agree this region of Azerbaijan will be controlled by Russian 
troops and international observers. 
  Pavel Grachev made great efforts to convince Rasul Guliyev 
and parliamentarians accompanying him that the Russian plan of 
the settlement of the problem is realistic, dispel their doubts 
about the appearance of a new wave of refugees after the 
withdrawal of the Azeri Army from the present positions, a 
confidential source told ITAR-TASS.

  [Text] On the night of April 27 Azeri troops will cease 
their fire along the front line in Nagorno-Karabakh. The 
agreement was reached by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
and Chairman of the Azeri parliament Rasul Guliyev in Moscow on 
Tuesday. 
  After the meeting Grachev told journalists that he intends 
to 
file a similar request to the opposing side in the conflict in 
the near future. He expressed the hope that it might become an 
efficient step in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. 
  Grachev also said that at the meeting with Guliyev the two 
sides agreed in principle on the problem of a missile attack 
warning station in Gabala. Grachev hopes that the governments 
of Russia and Azerbaijan will soon agree on the official status 
of the station as a Russian military base on Azeri territory. 
"That would serve the interests and security of Russia, 
Azerbaijan and other CIS countries," Grachev pointed out.

  [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- "We must first of all 
solve the problem of stopping hostilities in Nagorny Karabakh 
and then gradually settle all the other issues, linked with that 
conflict," Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Council of the 
Federation, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, said 
today during his meeting with chairman of the Azeri Supreme 
Soviet Rasul Guliyev. 
  Informing journalists on the meeting, head of the council's 
press centre Yuriy Algunov said that in Guliyev's opinion 
"nobody needed the continuation of the Karabakh conflict". He 
said that the war was lately receding, but it was a very slow 
process. 
  Informing the guest on the work of the upper chamber of the 
Russian parliament, Shumeyko noted that there were several views 
on the status of the Council of the Federation. Some people 
believe the council should be a buffer between the president and 
the State Duma. Shumeyko stressed in this connection that the 
"legislative power has never been nor will be a buffer". 
  Shumeyko, who is also chairman of the Council of the CIS 
Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, dwelt on the role of parliaments 
in the effort to integrate the members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS). He noted that the former Soviet 
republics had many common interests. The problem is to "find 
optimal ways for their rapprochement without harming their 
sovereignty".

  [Text] Speaker of the Russian State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, met 
Monday speaker of the Azeri parliament, Rasul Guliyev. 
  A spokesman for the State Duma quoted Guliyev as saying that 
the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia cannot be solved 
without Russia's involvement. For his part, Rybkin said that 
even though Russia was criticized by many for "taking too much 
upon itself" in terms of settling ethnic conflicts, its efforts 
are "sincere and will be continued". 
  Guliyev stated with regret that Russia was gradually losing 
its influence in Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan in Russia. This 
cannot be permitted, he said, since close economic contacts 
between Moscow and Baku will do more for strengthening the 
Russian influence in the East than "the use of force". 
  Under discussion was also the problem of drawing closer the 
Russian and Azeri legislations, first of all, in the sphere of 
customs.

  [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS -- Traditional friendly and 
goodneighbourly relations between Russia and Azerbaijan of 
centuries-long standing are not subject to time-serving 
considerations, Azerbaijani Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev on 
visit here told a session of the Federation Council (the upper 
house of the Russian parliament) on Wednesday. 
  According to Guliyev, the historical task of statesmen 
consists in preserving these traditions. 
  He called on the Russian legislators to do their best to 
make 
friendship and mutual understanding a leit-motiv of future 
relations between the two countries. 
  Azerbaijan takes on an important task of establishing 
friendly, balanced relations with the rest of the world and with 
Russia in the first place, he said. 
  "In this respect, our general position consists in attaching 
an irreversible character to the positive development of the 
interstate relations; that is, these relations should not depend 
on momentary, time-serving considerations and move onward," the 
Azerbaijani parliament speaker said. 
  Azerbaijan pays special attention to forming a legal basis 
of 
interstate relations, involving various fields. The supreme 
law-making bodies are playing a leading part in forming such a 
legal basis and in this connection he expressed hope that 
Russian and Azerbaijani parliaments would do their best to put 
the bilateral relations on this authoritative basis, Guliyev 
said. 
  Guliyev described current situation in Azerbaijan as 
complex, 
characterized by a drop in production, destroyed economic ties, 
weakness of the financial system and other acute consequences of 
economic crisis. 
  "One might try to get out of the tight spot on one's own, 
but 
one would have to pay an exorbitant price for such an attempt," 
he remarked. In his opinion, therefore, it would be reasonable 
for Russia and Azerbaijan to join efforts for the purpose of 
exchanging help and support. 
  Azerbaijan attaches "great importance to Russian experience 
in implementing large-scale economic reforms, to cooperation in 
the field of safeguarding human rights and creating new state 
structuring", he emphasized. 
  Guliyev also spoke at length about Armeno-Azerbaijani 
conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. In his opinion, the most 
important thing now is to stop the bloodshed, to put an end to 
the war because this will meet the vital interests of Azerbaijan 
and Armenia.

  [Begin Ochakhly recording] Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the 
Republic's Supreme Soviet, and other members of the National 
Assembly, who are on a visit to Moscow, met today with Vladimir

assembly since its formation. 
  Rasul Guliyev noted that Azerbaijan is ready to establish 
bilateral relations with all the countries, primarily with 
Russia, on the condition of respect for principles of mutual

inviolability of the borders and territorial integrity, peaceful 
resolution of conflicts, and no interference in each other's 
domestic affairs. 
  He also informed the deputies about the occupation of our 
lands by Armenian Armed Forces and the detention of 4,000 
hostages and prisoners of war under unbearable conditions in 
Armenia.

any conflict arising between the CIS members. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow (April 27) TURAN--"Russia sees introduction 
of separating peacemaking forces of the CIS as effective means 
in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict", said 
Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, during the meeting 
with speaker of Azerbaijani Parliament, Rasul Guliyev. 
  Sources in Russian Foreign Ministry report that during the 
talks with Russian Foreign Ministry, Azerbaijani delegation 
announced Baku's attitude to Russian settlement plan. 
  As was known, Azerbaijan's position is: unconditional 
withdrawal of Armenian troops from occupied Azerbaijani 
territories, talks concerning the status of Nagorno-Karabakh 
must begin after return of Azerbaijani refugees to their native 
lands. Baku does not agree to give the control over Lachin and 
Shusha to Armenia or any foreign state. 
  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that "the position 
of Azerbaijani party can aggravate settlement of the problem 
since Armenia will never agree to accept these proposals". 
  On Tuesday Azerbaijan officials has met with Russian 
officials in the Russian Duma and Russian Defense Ministry.

<F P=106> [Boris Glebov article: "Sevastopol Will Stick in General </F>
Grachev's Memory for a Long Time"] 
  [Text] In addition to the diplomatic failure of the talks 
on the Black Sea Fleet between the defense ministers of Russia 
and Ukraine, General Grachev's visit to Sevastopol also 
distressed him personally. After the virtual collapse of the 
talks Ministers Grachev and Radetskyy publicly exchanged caustic 
remarks: In a statement on Ukrainian television Gen. Vitaliy 
Radetskyy bitingly "nicknamed" Pavel Grachev "pan general." 
  Already standing on the steps of the "ministerial" Tu-154, 
Gen. Grachev in turn told the Ukrainian officers seeing him off 
his opinion of the reception given him and the entire Russian 
delegation on Ukrainian soil. The crux of Minister Grachev's 
statement boiled down to this: Of course, Ukraine is still a 
very young state, but this certainly does not excuse the way 
foreign delegations are received here (Grachev had in mind the 
Russian Defense Ministry delegation). Pavel Grachev went on to 
insert a sentence about the Ukrainian side's lack of concepts of 
diplomatic etiquette and said that he would not have been at all 
surprised if, instead of leaving for Moscow, Ukrainian 
special-purpose troops had arrested the Russian delegation right 
at the airport and clapped him -- the Russian Federation 
minister of defense -- in handcuffs! 
  The persons accompanying Grachev were evidently not the only 
ones to appreciate the general's joke, for by a "strange" 
coincidence the Ukrainian air traffic controllers (the Russian 
delegation was flying from the "Belbek" military airfield of the 
Ukrainian Air Defense Forces) prohibited Grachev's aircraft from 
taking off. From 1600 through 1740 hours -- for almost two 
hours -- Ukraine did not grant the Russian delegation the right 
to leave Ukrainian soil. It all ended in Pavel Grachev, now 
beside himself, issuing a personal order to the commander of his 
Tu-154: "To hell with them, we're taking off!..." The airliner 
with the Russian delegation on board took off from "Belbek" 
without permission from the Ukrainian air traffic controllers. 
  Incidentally, according to recent data, at the time of the 
Russian-Ukrainian talks in Sevastopol Admiral Eduard Baltin, 
commander of the Black Sea Fleet, took no part in them because 
he was on the "sick list" with a heart attack. The Black Sea 
Fleet leadership was represented by Vice Admiral Vitaliy 
Larionov, deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The Ukrainian side greeted the Russian delegation more than 
strangely: A military subunit of the Ukrainian Air Defense 
Forces stationed on Cape Khersones, in full combat gear, 
rehearsed...the defense of the approaches to Khersones against 
attack by units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet! At the same 
time, on the roof of Sevastopol dolphinarium, servicemen of the 
Ukrainian Navy's marines had ostentatiously set up a post for 
round-the-clock observation of the Black Sea Fleet Marines 
brigade (based in "Kazachya" Bay, within the limits of 
Sevastopol). Observation is still being carried out using 
special facilities: night-vision devices and the latest 
communications equipment. Ukrainian servicemen do not conceal 
their animosity toward the target of observation. 
  Directly after the Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
delegation left Sevastopol, the Ukrainian side put very strong 
pressure on senior officers of the Black Sea Fleet Marines 
brigade (from "Kazachya" Bay) to make them switch to the 
Ukrainian side and take the Ukrainian oath. 
  They even telephoned certain Russian officers of the Black 
Sea Fleet at home, agitating for Ukraine. In their official 
zeal the "agitators" -- Ukrainian Navy officers Captain First 
Rank Yevgeniy Ivanov and Lieutenant Colonel Aleksey Murashev -- 
went so far in their "agitation" that they even disavowed a 
statement by their own President Kravchuk and explained to the 
Russian sailors that Sevastopol will no longer be a base of the 
Russian Black Sea Fleet! 
  There then followed, naturally, promises of high official 
salaries and ranks in the Ukrainian Armed Forces right up to 
those of a general. And all this just for switching the Black 
Sea Fleet Marines brigade in Sevastopol to the Ukrainian oath 
and command.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Selivanov report in the "Power" column: "Who </F>
Controls the Situation in Ukraine. Or Why Mr. Radetskyy Ignores 
President Kravchuk's Position"] 
  [Text] Because the final session of the former Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet took place a few days ago, the legislative branch 
in the republic has temporarily ceased to exist. For now, it is 
hard to tell how long this will last. Therefore, during this 
period all power in Ukraine has been concentrated in the hands 
of Leonid Kravchuk, who is to continue in his presidential post 
for approximately two more months. Nonetheless, judging by some 
signs, Mr. Kravchuk's control of the situation is rather weak. 
The most graphic evidence of this is the openly rebellious 
behavior by Ukraine Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who at 
the talks in Sevastopol completely ignored his president's 
position on the issue of Black Sea Fleet basing, even at the 
risk of thwarting the talks. 
  Observers consider at least three versions explaining the 
situation that has arisen. First, it cannot be ruled out that 
Kravchuk and Radetskyy are acting on an earlier coordinated 
plan. The president is demonstrating his inherent peace-loving 
nature, while the defense minister, who has ostensibly "gotten 
out of hand," is "misbehaving" somewhat. Yet at stake is Mr. 
Kravchuk's personal prestige and his ability to control the 
situation. He would hardly agree to have his competence called 
into question. The second version is based on the assumption 
that at the talks in Moscow, Leonid Kravchuk went too far in 
agreeing to the principle of the navies' separate basing, and 
then, recognizing his mistake, left Vitaliy Radetskyy to make up 
for his blunder. It is hard to believe, however, that such an 
experienced and cunning politician as Leonid Kravchuk, who 
carefully calculates his moves, could have disgraced himself so. 
  Since the first two explanations of the situation that has 
emerged in the relations between the Ukrainian president and his 
defense minister are inconsistent, there is the last one -- most 
simple and alarming. Leonid Kravchuk is gradually losing 
effective control of the events. If this assumption is true, 
therefore not only legislative but also any supreme political 
authority is absent in Ukraine. 
  The resultant period of power vacuum can be taken advantage 
of primarily by various national-patriotic organizations. In 
light of this the manifestation of unusual independence on the 
part of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, where the most avid 
supporters of the national-patriotic idea are concentrated, is a 
more than alarming symptom. 
  According to some leaders of the national-radical 
orientation, such as Mikhail Goryn and Stepan Khmara, the 
patriotic forces of Ukraine have literally just a few weeks to 
save the great power from another enslavement. This time frame 
is dictated by the date of the upcoming June presidential 
elections. The elections will not gain anything for the 
national patriots, while the advent to power of a leader like 
Leonid Kuchma is regarded by them as the end of the history of 
independent Ukraine. The wish of the "true patriots" to prevent 
such an end is quite natural. Which methods will be used for 
this, the very near future will show. Yet it is clear already 
at this stage that they can be rather far from democracy, which 
has not justified the "nationalists'" hopes: That much is clear 
to anyone today. Signs are that Vitaliy Radetskyy, who is 
showing an "independence" rather unusual for a defense minister, 
has been assigned a far from minor role in the pending events.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Maryukha report: "Northern Fleet Seamen Write a </F>
Letter to `Pan [Ukrainian equivalent of `Mr.'] Admiral.' 
Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy's Former Colleagues Would Like To Know 
When He Was Honest"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The submariners of the 
Northern Fleet relate the illegal actions against Black Sea 
Fleet personnel directly to their former colleague, Vice Admiral 
Vladimir Bezkorokaynyy, currently commander in chief of the 
Ukraine Navy. More than 30 admirals and senior officers of the 
unit, which in the past was under Vladimir Gerasimovich's 
command, signed an open letter to "Pan Admiral" with the only 
aim: to understand when their former colleague was honest with 
them and himself. Either on the day the State Committee for the 
State of Emergency was formed, when he "solemnly announced 
before servicemen in formation the long-awaited eclipse of 
democracy," or four days later, when he "swore loyalty to the 
new ruling authority." Or maybe when he called: "Let us stand 
up for Russia! We shall not allow the union of fraternal 
peoples welded by blood to be destroyed." Or when guys in 
camouflage uniform committed acts of arbitrariness with respect 
to the families of those who only a few months ago "you called 
Black Sea Fleet heroes." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>
  [Excerpt] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The signing of the 
Chinese-Kazakh border agreement in Almaty on Tuesday "has no 
effect" on future talks between the joint delegation from 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan, and China about 
the western part of the former Soviet-Chinese border, a 
high-ranking diplomat taking part in these talks told the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent today. According to him, "everything is 
going well at the moment" and Kazakhstan's representatives will 
obviously continue to take part in the work of the joint 
delegation, since some work on the demarcation of the border 
still lies ahead. 
  Russia, the diplomat said, has "absolutely no problems" on 
the 55 kilometer western section of its border with China.
