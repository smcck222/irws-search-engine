  [Text] Ankara, April 10 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin said on Sunday [10 April] that the United Nations will be 
under moral blame if the claims that say Serbia carried out a 
chemical attack on Gorazde become true. 
  Cetin said he called Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic on the 
phone to talk about the developments happening in Bosnia and 
added that Silajdzic said during their searches in hospitals, 
they haven't met any evidence that chemical weapon was used in 
Gorazde. 
  Cetin said there is no specific information that chemical 
weapons were used and the number of casualties in Gorazde were 
not known either. 
  The foreign minister said NATO was ready for intervention 
however they haven't yet received any order from the UN 
representative in Bosnia. 
  Cetin recalled that the situation in Gorazde was discussed 
during a Turkish-Bosnian-Croatian tripartite meeting which was 
held earlier this week "we called for the UN to take necessary 
measures against the situation" he added. 
  "We have completed our preparations to call NATO and the UN 
Security Council for a meeting if the claims come true" Cetin 
said.

  [Text] The diplomatic and political cooperation which has 
existed so far between Poland, France, and Germany is to be 
extended to security, the defense ministers of these three 
countries agreed in Paris. 
  [Reporter Grzegorz Dobiecki] A joint communique, the details 
of which are still being worked out, confirms the decisive 
support of France and Germany for the idea of Polish association 
with the Western European Union [WEU], the military arm of the 
Community. A binding decision in this matter can be expected in 
May. 
  The defense ministers of the three countries are to hold 
annual meetings, just as the foreign ministers of France, 
Poland, and Germany have been doing for the past two years. 
Military cooperation is to be equally regular: constant contact 
between general staffs and joint exercises for army units. 
  One should emphasize that the Paris communique speaks only 
of 
Poland as regards the prospect of association with the WEU and 
of direct cooperation with France and Germany. It generally does 
not speak about the countries of Central and Eastern Europe or 
about the Visegrad group. The French defense minister, opening 
the meeting of the Weimar Three quite clearly said: There is no 
Poland without Europe, just as Europe without Poland is 
unimaginable. Polish participation in all European structures 
is obvious in a time perspective. Today we shall be talking 
among ourselves about how to achieve the fastest possible 
rapprochement of Poland to the WEU. 
  [Announcer] Our correspondent found out unofficially that 
Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk met yesterday the special army 
representative of the French president who said: Poland will not 
remain for long in the gray area of security in Europe. It will 
swiftly enter a field of the same colors as those protecting the 
western area of the continent.

  [Text] The first British-made European Fighter Aircraft 
made its maiden flight today -- and with it went the hopes of 
thousands of British Aerospace workers. 
  Those who turned out to watch history in the making were not 
disappointed. The Eurofighter 2000 completed a perfect 
50-minute test flight in the sky above Lancashire. 
  Flown by British Aerospace Defence Limited Director of 
Flight 
Operations, Chris Yeo, the aircraft took off from BAE's Military 
Aircraft Division Flight Test Facility at Warton, near Preston. 
  Designed to meet the specifications of the four nations 
involved -- the UK, France, Spain and Germany -- each 
Eurofighter 2000 is valued at 20 million pounds. But to British 
Aerospace workforce the true value of the Eurofighter lies in 
the long-term job security it could provide for around 20,000 
workers. 
  After the maiden flight, Chris Yeo praised the performance 
of 
the plane saying: "The aircraft handled extremely well and gave 
a good indication of its performance potential." 
  The Eurofighter 2000 is described as a high-performance, 
agile combat aircraft which is optimised for the air superiority 
role in both beyond visual range and close combat situations. 
  John Weston, chairman and managing director of the British 
Aerospace Defence Limited, said: "We are delighted with the news 
of this important first flight. Like its German counterpart, 
the aircraft performed exactly as expected and we are now 
working closely with Germany to carry out early flight test 
tasks. The success of this programme is essential for the 
European high technology industrial base and for jobs across the 
European aerospace industry."

  [Text] Brussels, April 7 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
proposed here Thursday [7 April] that all driftnet fishing in 
European waters should be outlawed by December 31, 1997, and 
that particularly long driftnets should be banned at the end of 
1994. 
  Driftnets, known as "walls of death," are used to catch 
white 
tuna in the North Atlantic, salmon in the Baltic and swordfish 
in the Mediterranean. 
  But they are blamed for also indiscriminately entrapping and 
killing seabirds and mammals such as dolphins. 
  The European Union's executive European Commission quoted 
scientific studies estimating that 1,700 dolphins were captured 
by driftnets last year in the north-east Atlantic. 
  The Commission agreed that French fishermen should be 
allowed 
an extra year, to the end of this year, to stop using driftnets 
measuring between 2.5 and five kilometres (1.6 to three miles). 
  An EU spokesman said the Commission would propose to a 
ministerial council next week that the extent of fishing by 
means of driftnets up to 2.5 kilometres long should be frozen at 
end-1994, then gradually phased out by end-1997. 
  The longer nets have been banned since 1992. But fishermen 
which had used them before that date -- mainly 31 French boats 
operating in the north-east Atlantic -- were given until the end 
of last year to phase them out. 
  EU fishing ministers have been unable to agree whether to 
prolong the extension, despite strong pressure from the French 
driftnet fishermen. 
  But a Commission spokesman said the French boats should be 
given the right to use the longer nets for one more fishing 
season. 
  EU Fisheries Commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas also urged 
tighter controls on driftnet fishing. He quoted a report saying 
that illicit use of the larger nets was widespread.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with French Cooperation Minister Michel </F>
Roussin by unidentified correspondent -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] You are dealing with this operation 
to evacuate French nationals from Rwanda in cooperation with the 
defense and the foreign ministries. How is the evacuation going 
on? 
  [Roussin] I would add that the prime minister is also 
following the situation closely. He kept very well informed 
from Peking, and urged us to speed up the process we have begun. 
  The evacuation of French nationals is continuing. It began 
yesterday evening. Things are quite complicated. We are very 
worried about the situation in Kigali, but we were able to 
collect people in their homes, assemble them at a number of 
meeting points in the capital, and then transfer them to the 
airport along roads which our paratroopers control -- there are 
just over 500 of them, not 400 as you said in an earlier report. 
  [Correspondent] Just over 150 French nationals have left 
Rwanda. There are about 450 left? 
  [Roussin] Yes, 450 are left, but we will also probably have 
a 
role to play in looking after the 1,500 Belgians, the 300 
Americans, and the 200 plus other Europeans. There is also a 
large Italian community. 
  [Correspondent] There are just over 3,000 foreign nationals 
in Rwanda? 
  [Roussin] Yes, something like that. 
  [Correspondent] Are you confident that the French and the 
others be able to leave this country? 
  [Roussin] Yes, I am confident, because the operation is 
working well. Our capacity allows us to evacuate the people we 
are assembling at the airport very quickly. We have sufficient 
air capacity. We have Belgian air capacity in reserve. The 
Americans are in Bujumbura. A plane is on its way from Italy. 
So we have been the spearhead of this operation, which is a 
protective, a security, a humanitarian operation. We are very 
committed to it. 
  [Correspondent] You say this is a protective operation. The 
rebels have asked you to remain neutral. Will you remain 
neutral? 
  [Roussin] France has always been neutral in the conflict 
which for years has set Hutus and Tutsis. in opposition to each 
other. It is thanks to us that these two ethnic groups got 
round the table at Arusha in Tanzania last August. We have 
always done everything to ensure the return of calm to Rwanda. 
War has broken out again, and the Rwandans will have to deal 
with this, stopping the massacres, ensuring the return of 
peace, signing a cease-fire. France will always be present if it 
is asked, but this action is just a security action to evacuate 
our compatriots. 
  [Correspondent] If the rebels were to enter Kigali, would 
the 
French remain absolutely neutral? 
  [Roussin] Absolutely. Our only mission is to ensure the 
protection and the evacuation of our compatriots. 
  [Correspondent] You spoke of massacres. Have there really 
been tens of thousands of dead as has been claimed? 
  [Roussin] There have been massacres. Information at our 
disposal from witnesses in Rwanda indicates that there have been 
massacres. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you Michel Roussin.

  [Text] French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin said late 
yesterday afternoon that French troops would not remain in 
Rwanda after the evacuation operation. Last night he was at 
Roissy airport, near Paris, where he welcomed the first French 
evacuees. He declared that the operation could already be 
considered a success. 
  [Begin Roussin recording] I would like to use this occasion 
to thank the troops and the crews of the military transport 
units who made the necessary planes available and made it 
possible to evacuate French nationals to Bujumbura and Bangui. 
We were helped by the people of the Central African Republic 
[CAR] and of Burundi: This has to be mentioned. Both in Bangui 
and in Burundi, we were welcomed by our friends. [end recording]

between October 1990 to December 1993. [passage omitted].

that the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels have given a 
warning to France and to other Western countries. They have 
asked them to be neutral in this ethnic war. Francois 
Rutayisire, the RPF representative in Paris is quite unambiguous: 
  [Begin Rutayisire recording] Three years ago, France sent in 
its troops, saying they were there to protect and evacuate 
French nationals. They ended up staying for three years. We 
hope this is not going to be the same. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] If on their way to Kigali, RPF 
troops come into contact with French troops barring their way, 
will they react violently? 
  [Rutayisire] One of our spokesmen has already answered this 
question. If anyone gets in the way of the RPF forces, who are 
fighting to eliminate the presidential Guard, the RPF will not 
hesitate to fight. 
  [Correspondent] Including against French troops? 
  [Rutayisire] Against whoever gets in its way. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by </F>
correspondent Philippe Harrouard in China; date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Balladur] The aim of my visit was first and 
foremost political. It will be followed by a trip by a Chinese 
minister to Paris and by a trip by French ministers to China in 
order to develop economic relations. Indeed, the Chinese 
believe that, in several spheres, French industry can bring them 
a lot, and it can also bring a lot to employment in our country, 
for instance through the development of power stations, 
telecommunications projects, and -- it remains to be seen 
whether this takes place -- projects for the export of French 
wheat to China. 
  The aim was to turn a page in our relations and to resume 
relations which would be more fruitful and more useful for the 
two countries. This was my aim, and I believe that this aim has 
been achieved. 
  [Harrouard] You tackled the issue of human rights with the 
Chinese authorities. You chose to do so discreetly because you 
believe that it is more efficient. However, dissidents were 
arrested during your stay. Didn't that disturb your visit? 
  [Balladur] From the moment attitudes towards economy and 
trade get closer, we enter the 21st century where attitudes 
concerning political freedom, human rights, must be closer. 
This is what I told my interlocutors. I told them it was an 
evolution for which all countries should prepare themselves. As 
for the precise problems which may arise, I mentioned them in a 
purely private conversation and I had the opportunity to say 
that, as far as this was concerned, it seemed to me that it was 
more efficient to remain discreet because one should refrain 
from upsetting one's interlocutor unnecessarily. 
  Let us look at what other countries do, those who would like 
to give the impression that they can lecture others on this 
subject: They are often those who ignore the beliefs they 
usually show off when it is in their interest. As far as we 
French are concerned, we must do two things simultaneously: We 
must continue to assert our general beliefs -- this is our right 
-- while respecting the attitudes and the beliefs of the others, 
and making sure that, through understanding and dialogue, things 
will evolve gradually. 
  [Harrouard] Does your visit to China mark the desire of the 
prime minister to be more involved in international affairs, and 
to go on more visits abroad? 
  [Balladur] I believe that, by far, my main task is in 
France. 
This is the main reason behind my mandate. Nevertheless, in 
order to improve the situation of our country... [pauses] it is 
starting to improve in the economic sphere and as far as 
employment is concerned, although there are still many 
difficulties. However, there are a whole range of international 
matters which, quite obviously, are of interest to the 
government. I believe that, as far as foreign policy is 
concerned, our constitution gives responsibility to the 
president, of course, and to the government, and that they must 
carry them out on good terms. This is what happened for the 
preparation of my trip to China, this is also what happened as 
far as GATT was concerned, or last year's monetary crisis. I 
have no plans to travel to any other foreign country in the near 
future. Should I have other plans, it would be because I 
consider it an important issue which affects the life of our 
country and its economic and interior policy.

  [Text] In Beijing, Edouard Balladur, the French Prime 
Minister, remains unperturbed at Chinese provocations. In the 
middle of the French prime minister's visit the police have 
arrested another dissident, Xu Wenli, a leading figure of the 
opposition and a known francophile. Our reporter asked Mr. 
Balladur about the arrest; however, the prime minister shied 
away from any direct comment. 
  [Begin Balladur recording] I emphasized the importance that 
France, the birthplace of human rights, attaches to the respect 
of human rights in all its relations with different countries 
around the world. It is quite true that to do this we must take 
account of everyone's traditions, and of the rhythm of evolution 
appropriate to each country. Moreover, it is true that economic 
and commercial progress, which increasingly tends to unite the 
world, is accompanied by what I would call an intellectual and 
cultural unification, so that a sort of community of the spirit 
grows around the world from which no country can entirely opt 
out. It indeed seemed useful to me to have a more restricted 
conversation with my Chinese counterpart. I have one more word 
to add, and this is all I will say: on this subject, efficiency 
is more often better served by discretion than by publicity. 
[end recording] 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin has officially been invited to 
France on a date of his choosing. According to Balladur, this 
invitation marks the new era in the two countries' relations.

  [Text] Paris, April 11 (AFP) -- France tackled China over 
human rights during a visit by French Premier Edouard Balladur, 
his Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on radio here Monday [11 
April]. 
  Speaking on Europe 1, Juppe said France had discussed with 
the Chinese authorities "our conception of human rights" and 
"how we considered that from this point of view the situation in 
China was unsatisfactory." 
  Questioned about the arrests of a number of dissidents 
during 
the Balladur visit, Juppe said that there had been 
"disinformation" surrounding the affair, noting that a Chinese 
minister had denied the arrests while "the New China News Agency 
had confirmed them in a dispatch." 
  The French minister said the aim of the trip, "to renew 
political dialogue with China," had been achieved. 
  Paris was willing to cooperate with Taiwan, said Juppe, but 
added that China needed telephone lines, nuclear power stations, 
high- speed trains and wheat. 
  "It is with this in mind that we also renewed dialogue," 
said 
Juppe. 
  Normal relations between Paris and Beijing were restored on 
January 12 when Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms 
contracts with Taiwan, healing a year-long rift. 
  Relations had become strained after a contract for the sale 
of 60 advanced Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by 
the sale of gunboats.

  [Excerpts] France has given a limited visa to the Russian 
extreme right-wing leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who is to 
attend a meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. The 
visa is limited to his presence at the European Parliament. 
Paris will not be sorry, simply because when he arrived, 
Zhirinovskiy, true to his simplistic way of thinking -- to put 
it mildly -- hastened to insult the host country. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reporter Christine Boos] When he arrived at Roissy airport, 
Zhirinovskiy made a violent attack on the French government: 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in French] I greet Paris as 
the city of Arabs. In 10, 20 years things will be all over for 
France. One day things will be over. The same for Germany: It 
will be the Turks in charge there. Only Russia remains a white 
country, the country of natural democracy, where there are human 
rights for all, without discrimination, as your minister of 
foreign affairs practises. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Gilles Bresson report: "European Elections: Chirac's </F>
Battle To Have Rally for the Republic Accept Dominique Baudis"] 
  [Excerpt] Following the RPR's [Rally for the Republic] 
parliamentary group and urged to do so by Jacques Chirac, senior 
RPR offcials yesterday "took note" of the choice of Dominique 
Baudis, the CDS [Social Democratic Center] mayor of Toulouse, to 
head the majority's list for the European elections. Only 
Etienne Pinte, the representative for Yvelines and supporter of 
Philippe Seguin [Assembly speaker], and Robert Schumann, a 
northern senator and historic Gaullist, refused to sign the 
movement's statement as the mayor of Paris [Chirac] was urging 
them to do. As soon as the news became known, Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing said how happy he was "with the swift, sympathetic 
reaction of the RPR." Moreover, after a meeting of the 
leadership of the UDF [French Democratic Union], he said that he 
was "ready to help his partners put the finishing touches to the 
list in a spirit of union and harmony." 
  This being the case, the consecration of Dominique Baudis is 
going ahead, provoking serious gnashing of teeth among the 
Gaullists. Moreover, although it was not turbulent, yesterday 
morning's meeting of senior RPR officials, which took place 
behind closed doors, was certainly lively. First of all, 
Philippe Seguin, president of the National Assembly and leader 
of the anti-Maastricht lobby, switched his telephone to an 
answering service after having expressed his disagreement with 
Jacques Chirac, with whom he had spoken on the telephone. 
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, who was away on business with 
the DST [Directorate of Territorial Surveillance], had also sent 
his apologies. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is 
the general secretary of the RPR, was prevented from attending 
because he is on a visit to China. Straight away, Jacques Chirac 
sought to set the parameters of the debate. 
  "The French," he started explaining, "laugh at political 
quarrels, and are preoccupied with other problems. They are 
hostile to splits, and they would not understand why the 
majority had split over Europe. The European Parliament does 
not have any great power. Moreover, there is no need to start a 
confrontation over Europe with our partners. The prime minister 
would like to have a joint list. Anyway, the platform signed 
with the UDF does not tally with our vision of Europe. We are 
simply giving a five-year mandate to our members of Parliament." 
The RPR leader then proceeded to touch on the question coming 
at the top of the list: "We wanted Alain Juppe, but the prime 
minister's opposition to his name led us to assume that the UDF 
was choosing its candidate on the pretext that we had the prime 
ministership and the presidency of the National Assembly. The 
nomination of Dominique Baudis caused a stir within the UDF. We 
should not seek to involve ourselves in the business of the UDF. 
The leadership of the RPR's parliamentary group was right to 
accept this choice. The same goes for Charles Pasqua. Seguin 
explained to me that this did not tally with his vision of the 
way things should be, and that he wanted to remain on the 
sidelines of this particular debate." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Gerard Longuet by Yves </F>
Messarovitch and Georges Potriquet; place and date not given: 
"China Must Accept All the Rules of the World Trade 
Organization"] 
  [Text] [LE FIGARO] Is the Europe-U.S. alliance on the 
subject of the social clause not likely to produce a blocking 
move in Marrakesh by the developing countries, which have 
already swallowed the other requirements in the spheres of 
agriculture and the environment? 
  [Longuet] In the framework of the long conversation I had 
with Mickey Kantor on 30 March, we agreed to put our "foot in 
the door." However, the aim is not to force our partners to join 
a system which, moreover, we have not yet defined. France and 
the United States want the social dimension of international 
trade to be taken into account. The aim is not to curb the 
expansion of the developing countries or to call into question 
competition with countries with low wages, but to ensure that 
our partners share concerns -- and hence objectives -- of a 
social nature. 
  Like democracy, freedom of information and human rights are 
imperatives, and there must also be a degree of respect for the 
worker. With a minimum and a limit. The minimum encompasses 
the International Labor Organization [ILO] and matters relating 
to enforced labor or child labor. I would readily describe it 
as a "humanitarian clause" without which world trade would not 
be morally acceptable. The limit is that there is no question 
of imposing our system of social protection on others. However, 
there must be some proportion, a relationship between the level 
of development and the degree of social protection. 
  [LE FIGARO] Why talk of this social clause now? 
  [Longuet] The GATT issue is based on three major 
considerations: solidarity among regional groupings (and we have 
succeeded in securing recognition of the European identity); 
respect for the environment; and the social clause. These are 
the preconditions of fair trade. Indeed, the countries which do 
not respect the international standards in the sphere of the 
environment should not benefit from an unfair advantage. 
Conversely, the protection of the environment must not be a 
pretext for adopting protectionist measures. That is why we 
were demanding the permanent establishment of a committee for 
the environment. We secured it. 
<H5>  Conquest and Relocation </H5>
  [Longuet continues] On the other hand, before 15 December, 
we 
did not want to call into question European solidarity by 
demanding, at the time, a monetary or social clause. Today, the 
United States is demanding the introduction of a social clause. 
This is a chance to seize the opportunity and try to move the 
European position in this direction. Here, too, our position is 
gaining ground, as the compromise adopted in Geneva yesterday 
shows. 
  With regard to the Third World countries, if we imposed 
restrictions on them, they would have reason to refuse them. 
But this is not the case: The social clause is the logical 
complement of the commercial provisions of the GATT agreement: 
The gradual dismantling of the AMF (Multifiber Agreement), the 
reduction in customs duties and -- if China one day joins GATT 
-- the dismantling of quota regulations. 
  Who will be affected by the social clause? The new 
industrialized countries, of course, and the developed countries 
which are considering relocation as an element of conquest. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is this not opening a new debate, while there 
has already been some backtracking on the proposals made in 
Geneva [as published] and a number of issues have not been 
settled? Are the shortcomings of the GATT agreement not being 
concealed? 
  [Longuet] Between 15 December and today, there has been some 
backtracking on a small number of tariff offers. 
  But, generally speaking, the GATT agreement is and remains 
positive: Customs duties will fall by 40 percent! That is a 
wonderful prospect for world trade. In terms of sector 
agreements, we knew that there were some difficult areas: 
aeronautics and financial services, for instance. Even on 
these two issues, negotiations are planned for after Marrakesh. 
  I think that making progress between 15 December 1993 and 15 
April 1994 on social issues is much more important than sadly 
noting that we have not received new offers of customs duty 
reductions. Reaching a good agreement with the Americans on 
social issues and aeronautics also strikes me as a good 
investment. With regard to the AMF, I would like to be sure 
that the lack of proposals to open textile markets by countries 
with low wages -- Pakistan and India, for instance -- will be 
well compensated for by a slower dismantling of tariffs 
affecting those countries. 
  [LE FIGARO] To return to Marrakesh, do you think that all 
the states present will sign? 
  [Longuet] Yes. I think that the significance of the event 
must be gauged. The creation of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) marks a new era in relations among countries. After the 
end of the Cold War and the military confrontation between the 
blocs, the creation of the WTO bears witness to a period in 
which the concerted development of human activity prevails over 
ideological and territorial confrontations. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is there likely to be a problem of ratification 
in some countries, especially in the United States? 
  [Longuet] I think that if Mickey Kantor, who succeeded in 
securing a favorable vote in the U.S. Congress on NAFTA, is 
demanding this social clause, it is because he has fully 
realized that it was useful to have this clause to ensure 
ratification of the GATT agreement. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is there not some inconsistency in welcoming the 
GATT agreements, explaining that they are good for France, and 
at the same time supporting the GATT entry of the new 
industrialized countries (NIC), where wages are 10 or 20 times 
lower? Will that not speed up the process of relocation? 
  [Longuet] In the sphere of development, the Asian NICs have 
taken the easiest route: producing consumer goods in a 
competitive way. They must now move on to the next stage: that 
of infrastructure, which is costly, which requires technology 
and capital, and in which we are very competitive. It will take 
them 10 or 20 years to catch up. 
<H5>  Toward the Western Model </H5>
  [Longuet continues] During this period, we will continue to 
sell them capital goods. But experience shows that these 
countries will have to face a fairly rapid increase in the cost 
of labor in their countries. Their ability to mobilize a cheap 
labor force is not unlimited, whereas the requirements of 
consumption are vast. The wage increases in Hong Kong, Chenxing, 
and Singapore are already considerable. We are therefore 
engaged in a race in which these countries are both our clients 
and our competitors. But they will be competitors less and less 
as their production costs become comparable with ours, and 
clients more and more as their purchasing power increases. The 
implementation of rules on forgery and intellectual property 
will now contribute to moving these countries toward the Western 
model. 
  [LE FIGARO] The problem for us is the cost of the 
transition, which is measured in particular in terms of 
relocation. 
  [Longuet] When the French consumer benefits from an increase 
in his purchasing power by the reduction in the price of 
products, the French producer does not benefit from a reduction 
in his production costs, in view of the cost of labor which 
nobody reasonably envisages reducing. The scales are tipped in 
the consumer's favor, to the producer's detriment. Should we 
not now seek a better balance? This is what we are doing by 
including some social security contributions in the budget. 
This eases the pressure on the producer and shifts it to the 
taxpayer, hence to the consumer, whose purchasing power will be 
reduced. If the load is shifted to sectors which are not 
exposed to world competition -- I am thinking, for example, of 
the distribution of gasoline by hiring pump attendants -- you 
penalize the consumer a little but you benefit employment. I 
think that this is now a priority. 
  [LE FIGARO] For years, the participants have been trying to 
introduce a monetary dimension to the GATT agreements. However, 
the Americans do not want that. What is most important: 
stabilizing the dollar or signing GATT agreements? 
  [Longuet] If we could do both, it would be perfect, but the 
stabilization of the dollar is largely beyond our control. We 
are participating in the organization of GATT and the creation 
of the WTO, and the WTO will become a factor of stability in a 
world which lacks it terribly. So, what is, basically, the best 
way of stabilizing the dollar? It is a European currency, which 
would make it possible to offer a refuge "as good as the 
dollar," as my friend Jacques Toubon would say. 
  [LE FIGARO] What is France's position on China joining GATT? 
  [Longuet] We are not hostile to it in theory. But, in view 
of China's size and the problems involved, the conditions of 
this membership really must be carefully defined. And China 
must accept all the rules of the WTO.

  [Text] Paris, April 8 (AFP) -- French firm Dassault 
Automatismes et Telecommunications (of the Dassault Electronique 
Group) on Friday [8 April] announced signature of a contract for 
supplying a complete wireless digital telephony system for the 
city of Chongqing, in Sichuan Province, southwestern China. 
  It did not indicate the value of the contract. 
  The announcement indicated that the network for Chongqing 
will be the equivalent of the French "Bi-Bop" cordless 
telephone, used by some pedestrians in Paris and other areas to 
make calls from wherever they happen to be.

  [Text] Paris, April 8 (AFP) -- Negotiators discussing 
Iran's 1.2-billion-franc ($204 million) trade debts with France 
failed to make headway at talks here this week on a rescheduling 
package, participants disclosed on Friday [8 April]. Talks 
would resume within a few weeks once the delegations had 
reported back to their governments, the sources said without 
giving any more precise date. They refused to specify what had 
blocked agreement, and said there was "nothing unusual" in such 
negotiations taking place in several stages. 
  Despite U.S. reservations about refinancing Iranian debt, 
Iran has in recent weeks won advantageous terms from its top 
trading partners Germany and Japan, plus Switzerland, Austria 
and Italy. It owes them almost 6.5 billion dollars and in most 
cases has been given four or five years to pay. 
  Unofficial sources here said France was offering only a 
year. 
Last year's suspension of credits from Coface, the body 
supplying insurance and credit for French exporters, would 
remain in force while the debt problem with Iran was unresolved, 
the sources said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 11 (AFP) -- NATO warplanes will 
shortly carry out new air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions 
around the besieged Moslem town of Gorazde, a UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) headquarters staffer said here Monday [11 
April]. 
  The air strikes had been ordered after the Serbs resumed 
shelling of the town, hitting the hospital and a building where 
UN military observers were housed, the UN staffer in the 
operations room said, asking not to be named. 
  UN Protection Force spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon 
dismissed 
the report as untrue, but sources close to NATO said planes had 
taken off and were flying low over Gorazde.

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner has strongly defended the alliance's air strike against 
Serb positions near Gorazde. "I cherish the hope that the new 
determination that can be seen in the United Nations and in us 
will not fail to have the appropriate effect on the Serbs," 
Woerner said on the Cologne private television station RTL on 
Monday evening [11 April]. He expressed the expectation that 
this would push the peace process on further, "If possible at 
the negotiating table." 
  With regard to Russian criticism, Woerner added that one 
could not start hours of consultation in the Security Council 
"to realize after days that we should really have taken action, 
but it was unfortunately impossible and now the people are 
already dead." The current consultation mechanism "should also 
satisfy Russian requirements." The NATO secretary general 
pointed out that the UN resolution under which the alliance was 
acting was "fully supported by Russia."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with NATO Secretary Manfred Woerner by </F>
Udo van Kampen, in Brussels on 11 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Van Kampen] NATO headquarters in Brussels 
this afternoon after the air raids [on Serbian positions near 
Gorazde] is visibly calm. Even though NATO headquarters does 
not want to reveal any details about the exact route of 
information, the command structure is clear. The endangered UN 
soldiers in Gorazde had asked for air support. The UN special 
envoy gave the go-ahead; a few minutes later the warplanes took 
off from Italy. The legal situation is clear: Last June the UN 
Security Council passed a resolution that precisely set down the 
procedure. At that time, Russia, too, agreed. [Woerner] 
First of all, if you ask for air support to protect troops 
under attack, you have to act quickly. If you start protracted 
consultations, you will be too late. This is quite certain. 
Second, we are acting on the basis of UN resolutions to which 
the Russians agreed. Third, the representative of the UN 
Secretary General is on site and he agreed. Thus, the demands 
made by the Russians have been fulfilled. [passage omitted] 
  [Van Kampen] Is there the risk now that NATO will be dragged 
into a protracted conflict? 
  [Woerner] We are trying to prevent that. So far, our 
actions have been limited. There are three different actions: 
first, close air support; second, the enforcement of the no-fly 
zone; third, some kind of ultimatum as in Sarajevo. All these 
are strictly limited actions. So far, we do not have any ground 
forces there, and there is no inclination to send ground forces 
there, unless a peace agreement can be enforced. This means, we 
will probably stick to the kind of force that we have chosen, 
namely providing air support for UNPROFOR. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Udine, April 12 (TANJUG)--The technical bureau of 
the Italian military airport in Aviano, close to Udine, on 
Monday [11 April] turned away a squadron of U.S. F-16's which 
were scheduled to land there. The technical bureau froze all 
contracts on servicing NATO aircraft. 
  Well informed sources say that this rejection of the U.S. 
fighter planes, which came from Germany, is the result of 
increasingly deteriorating relations between the Italian Air 
Force and NATO. 
  Aviano has for months been one of NATO's main bases from 
where air actions over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were 
launched. 
  The two U.S. F-16's, which bombed Serb positions near 
Gorazde 
on Sunday, also came from this air base. 
  NATO warplanes on Sunday bombed Serb positions near Gorazde, 
a Moslem enclave ruled by the United Nations as a safe area 
which was set to be demilitarized last spring. In late March 
10,000 Moslems surged from this zone in a strong offensive on 
Serb territories. 
  After the failure of the Moslem offensive the Serbs launched 
a strong counterattack coming to several km away from the city.

<F P=106> [By Marie Joannidis] </F>
  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France and Belgium are 
considering a rapid pull-out of their troops from Rwanda, once 
foreigners have been evacuated, leaving the United Nations and 
African countries to try to restore peace in the East African 
country. 
  The evacuation of 600 French nationals from Rwanda was 
nearly 
completed Monday [11 April], and French officials said French 
paratroopers sent there at the weekend would pull out very 
quickly, possibly starting on Tuesday. 
  In Paris, Foreign Ministry deputy spokeswoman Catherine 
Colonna stressed that the French paratroopers' mission was 
"purely humanitarian" and aimed only at evacuating foreign 
nationals. 
  Meanwhile in Brussels, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene told a parliamentary committee Monday that his 
government was considering withdrawing the 450 Belgian UN 
peacekeeping troops from Rwanda, where ethnic warfare between 
the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi tribes has left thousands 
dead. 
  Belgium sent the troops to its former colony last year to 
uphold a peace agreement signed in Arusha, Tanzania, between the 
Hutu-dominated government and the mainly Tutsi rebels of the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). 
  The Belgian troops have been stationed there, along with 
Ghanaians and Bangladeshi troops, within the framework of the 
United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda [MINUAR]. 
  Earlier Monday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called 
for a "relaunch of the process of dialogue" between the warring 
parties. 
  Speaking on French radio, Juppe said France would "do its 
utmost" in cooperation with Rwanda's neighbours, the 
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations to 
find a political solution to the conflict. 
  On Sunday, French Development Aid Minister Michel Roussin 
said it was up to "the United Nations to assume its 
responsibilities," adding that French forces would not "get 
mixed up" in the Rwandan fighting. 
  Belgium Foreign Minister Willy Claes is to meet UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in Geneva soon to discuss Belgium's 
role in peacekeeping forces. 
  "All will depend on what happens to the Arusha agreements," 
said Dehaene. 
  "If the Arusha agreements are abandoned, the problem will 
have to be addressed by the United Nations itself, because the 
peacekeeping troops were sent to Rwanda within the framework of 
the agreements." 
  "If there is still a will to apply the agreements, we must 
question the general role of peacekeeping troops and whether our 
own role in the mission is appropriate," he added. 
  Claes, for his part, suggested that the current MINUAR 
mandate was "too limited," adding that the United Nations should 
take up the matter. 
  French officials privately confess it would be too dangerous 
to leave French troops in Kigali where they might end up being 
drawn into the fighting. 
  In the past the RPF has accused France of siding with 
Rwandan 
government forces, notably when it stationed troops in the 
country between 1990 and 1993. 
  Belgium, on the other hand, is viewed by the Hutus as 
pro-Tutsi and believes that too rapid a French withdrawal might 
leave its own forces exposed, informed sources said. 
  Ten Belgian soldiers were killed Thursday by the Rwandan 
presidential guard, and at least three Belgian civilians have 
been reported killed in the fighting. 
  Both France and Belgium have also called on the United 
States 
to use its influence with the RPF and its Ugandan backers. 
  However observers here doubt whether the United Nations, 
which is already heavily engaged in peacekeeping operations 
elsewhere in the world, has the means for yet another 
intervention. 
  "All the more so as there will be fewer and fewer foreign 
witnesses to bear witness to the tragedy" unfolding in Rwanda, 
one observer predicted. 
  As for Africa, it lacks both the political and financial 
clout to deal with the problem. 
  "We have created a mechanism for the prevention of conflicts 
but its principle is stomped by lack of means," Senegalese 
President Abdou Diouf said here Monday. "We must be helped by 
countries which have the means to do it," he added.

  [Text] Strasbourg, April 11 (AFP) -- Maverick Russian MP 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had a row with European assemblymen here 
on Monday [11 April] when he gatecrashed a political party 
gathering. 
  He got into a meeting of the 44-strong liberal grouping, 
which had, however, written to him asking him to stay away from 
Strasbourg because of his extremist right-wing nationalist 
views. Zhirinovskiy's movement calls itself the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party and scored a striking success in December's 
general election. 
  Asked to leave the room, Zhirinovskiy berated the group as 
"CIA agents afraid to have a democratic debate." He added, "I 
was not invited here to drink champagne." 
  The liberal MP's walked out. 
  Zhirinovskiy is part of the 18-strong Russian delegation 
attending the Council of Europe's latest parliamentary assembly. 
Russia has had "special guest" status since 1990. 
  Assembly speaker Miguel Angel Martinez commented that 
Zhirinovskiy was "certainly not the most important" member of 
the Russian team. 
  The Russian MP earlier complained that France had given him 
a 
visa confining him to Strasbourg, and said that restriction on 
his movements was a violation of his rights as a Russian member 
of parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro </F>
by unattributed correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [EXPRESSO] Information is power. Will the new 
rules of openness not cause the Commission to lose power? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] No. What openness will do is to put an end 
to the false or illegitimate power held by those who, possessing 
information which they are not entitled to, use it in order to 
wield improper power. This is often the case with 
bureaucracies. Openness will help people understand better the 
significance of the Commission's decisions and avert 
arbitrariness. 
  [EXPRESSO] Do you believe that the Portuguese Government 
should follow the same rules? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] I can see no objective reason why it should 
not do so. It is a widespread trend. Even France, where the 
Napoleonic traditions and codes were strongest, has been 
increasing the openness of its administration. 
  [EXPRESSO] With a complex decisionmaking process, the EU 
[European Union] has a limited ability to respond, because it is 
very protracted. Is this not a shortcoming? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] It is an extremely grave shortcoming. For 
instance, as regards the trade defense machinery, it could have 
disastrous consequences and make it virtually ineffective. 
While in the United States, that kind of machinery for 
retaliation in international trade can be set in motion in 
weeks, in the EU it takes 18 months. It is a concern of ours -- 
and mine in particular -- to reduce the too extensive 
bureaucratic circulation of some documents. 
  [EXPRESSO] The Commission will never be effective with so 
slow a response. 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Of course there is machinery which must be 
safeguarded. The democratic nature of the process must not be 
diminished in favor of efficiency, but this matter has never 
been considered in a more pragmatic way. For instance, 
documents continue to be transmitted mostly by the traditional 
methods, when today electronic mail is a reality. Only now is 
the Commission -- under pressure from me -- moving ahead with 
its computer automation to a more advanced stage. 
  [EXPRESSO] The Commission is criticized for holding great 
power without being elected.... 
  [Deus Pinheiro] That power is not as great as people 
believe. Of course it has one considerable power -- that of 
initiative. The form of a decision is determined at the outset, 
but it must necessarily be approved by the Council, in many 
cases also by the European Parliament and in others by the 
national parliaments as well. There is another power -- that of 
implementation. But the Commission is overseen by the European 
Parliament, and increasingly by the Council -- and, in some 
cases, by the national parliaments. 
  [EXPRESSO] Would it not make sense to increase the European 
Parliament's powers? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] They have been increasing. What should have 
been increased is the national parliaments' powers. We can only 
be close to citizens if the national institutions take part more 
actively. 
  [EXPRESSO] Does that not not impair the ability to respond 
even more? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] The lack of ability to respond which I 
mentioned is more in the implementation than in the 
decisionmaking, which must necessarily be slow. We are in a 
novel organizational situation. Democratic procedure at this 
stage must be the top priority. Citizens are now afraid of the 
Community, following the debates on Maastricht. Without 
attention to this, we will have a set of Europeans opposed to 
the EU -- not because of its policies but because of its 
practices. 
  [EXPRESSO] With the EU's enlargement, are we moving toward 
an "a la carte" Europe? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] This can only be answered speculatively. As 
the EU expands, the tendency is for it to be less solid. What 
some people argue is that a hard core of those who accept all 
the deepenings could emerge within a Community enlarged to over 
20 countries. Countries such as Portugal -- on the periphery 
and with a certain economic backwardness but with a good 
political tradition, a history, and a heritage in Europe and the 
world -- should be very mindful of this fact in order not to 
find themselves suddenly in a situation of inferiority. 
  [EXPRESSO] What does being mindful mean? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Carefully following all tendencies in the 
direction of deepening and considering whether they suit us; for 
instance, matters such as the European defense pillar, which is 
taking shape with NATO's approval and the blessing of the United 
States. We must ponder the costs, explain them to our 
population, debate them in our parliament, and make a decision 
-- preferably sooner rather than later. 
  [EXPRESSO] Do you mean that Portuguese troops could go and 
fight for the Balkans, for instance? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Common defense is one thing; it is another 
when that defense includes the possibility of attacking third 
parties. Here all countries must reserve for themselves the 
right to decide on a case-by-case basis. 
  [EXPRESSO] The Portuguese population feel that their living 
standard remains very far from the European average. 
  [Deus Pinheiro] The money which comes from the EC makes it 
possible to create infrastructures, but that is not a sufficient 
condition in itself. That depends on boosting the economy and 
creating an entrepreneurial spirit -- a sphere in which the EC, 
while being able to provide a frame of reference, no longer 
interferes in the governments' policies. 
  [EXPRESSO] There is bewilderment in Portugal because 
traditional sectors such as agriculture are casualties of 
joining the EU. People are wondering what fate Brussels has in 
store for Portugal. 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Community policy aims are no longer the 
same. There was the matter of surpluses, that of prices, the 
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and, last, GATT. What 
was true in 1983 is untrue in 1994. Since Portugal was already 
trying to adjust to one framework and now must adjust to 
another, this confuses people and hampers governments' activity 
enormously. The situation is relatively stabilized. I know that 
the government is concerned about this, but I do not know what 
policies it is proposing for adjusting to the new environment. 
  [EXPRESSO] This proves that there is uncertainty about the 
country's future. 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Uncertainty, no. Portugal has unique 
conditions for success. What we must not believe is that we 
will succeed through the EU's assistance or through government 
resolve. Those bodies may be important, but it will be through 
the Portuguese people's work, our employers' resolve and 
boldness, and through our finally realizing that our thinking 
must not be provincial. In Portugal, the periphery and 
provincialism must be eradicated from people's minds and 
parochialism from debate. 
  [EXPRESSO] When do you advocate the East European countries' 
entry? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Very rapidly. The instability in East 
Europe is persisting, and the only anchor of stability is the 
EU. If you ask me whether the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, 
and Poland are fit to join, I do not believe so, but perhaps 
they could now join pillars two and three. It would be a way to 
help them join, even if the economic stage had to be left until 
later. 
  [EXPRESSO] Will that not weaken Portugal's position in the 
EU? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] We must not only consider the narrow context 
of East Europe but also look at other areas, such as the south. 
The gulf in development, capitation [as published], and living 
conditions existing between the southern shore of the 
Mediterranean and Europe is such as to create an increasing 
source of tension with not only a political and economic basis 
but also a cultural basis, which could be extremely difficult to 
resolve. In that event, Portugal could find itself in the front 
line, and then it will need support -- the more supportive 
countries the better. 
  [EXPRESSO] In your opinion, is the audiovisual sector 
primarily industry or culture? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Both. Until a year ago, it was 
essentially culture, but as I have delved into the issue, I have 
realized that the audiovisual sector is totally different what 
it was 10 years ago. It has become one of the industries with 
the greatest economic importance and development potential. 
  [EXPRESSO] So are you handling the issue from an economic 
viewpoint? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] No, always from a cultural viewpoint. This 
was clear in the GATT discussions. All the countries wish to 
safeguard the use of that powerful medium, based primarily on 
their language, but also on their culture, tradition, and 
heritage. 
  [EXPRESSO] But how are they to respond to U.S. competition 
with so great a diversity of cultures and with necessarily small 
markets? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] It is a great challenge for the Europeans: 
In cultural terms, to safeguard these values, and, in industrial 
terms, to seize an opportunity, with the changes forecast in the 
near future -- this, together with the creation of an 
information-based society in Europe, the so-called information 
superhighways, which are not unconnected with the audiovisual 
sector. 
  [EXPRESSO] But there will have to be state support.... 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Yes. A whole world which existed in Europe, 
linked to production and financing, has been depleted. 
Recreating that atmosphere will take time. 
  [EXPRESSO] Will Europe have a kind of Hollywood? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Europe should necessarily have several 
Hollywoods. 
  [EXPRESSO] Your portfolio does not seem to have 
characteristics as political as you wished and even announced. 
  [Deus Pinheiro] It does, indisputably, in political 
analysis, in relations with the European Parliament, and even in 
information and communication. Even the audiovisual sector has 
political aspects, which only a commissioner can handle. 
  [EXPRESSO] So are you not disappointed with the portfolio? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] By no means. In the most visible aspects -- 
information and the audiovisual sector -- we leave work 
accomplished. As far as administering those guidelines is 
concerned, I no longer know whether I would have the patience do 
so for five years. 
  [EXPRESSO] Do you mean that when there is a redistribution 
of portfolios, you are not interested in keeping the same post? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] No. The major changes have been made or 
will be made by the end of my term. After that, I feel no 
vocation for day-to-day administration. 
  [EXPRESSO] So do you intend to stay on as commissioner 
beyond this year? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] I have not yet decided. I will only examine 
this matter with the prime minister in the summer. 
  [EXPRESSO] Would you like to stay on? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] This job has fascinating aspects and unique 
moments. It has others when the struggle against bureaucracy, 
routine, and certain established practices make you wonder 
whether the despair at not seeing things progress is worthwhile. 
  [EXPRESSO] So you have moments of dejection? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Certainly, especially when I feel that the 
reasons why things are not progressing more quickly have nothing 
to do with their substance but rather with the system's 
inefficiencies, with petty personal envy, with established petty 
fiefdoms. 
  [EXPRESSO] If you stay on, what would you like to do? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] There are four or five portfolios which 
could be interesting, but I have not considered this matter, 
either. 
  [EXPRESSO] What are those portfolios? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] I will not enter into speculation, but it 
must be borne in mind that there will be more commissioners, and 
hence a reorganization of the portfolios. 
  [EXPRESSO] There seem to be many federalists in the European 
structures who, for political reasons, do not acknowledge 
themselves as such. Is that the case with you? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] I have never acknowledged myself and do not 
acknowledge myself as a federalist. I do not at all see the 
possibility -- and decreasingly so -- of the European states 
merging in any way into a single political entity. 
  [EXPRESSO] But is not federalism the only way for Europe to 
survive? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] No. There will be policies on which we 
must have a single voice. I have never minded this. In these 
matters our yardstick must be: Is what is wanted good or bad 
for Portugal? If it is good, it should be supported; if it is 
bad, it should be rejected, irrespective of the label placed on 
it. 
  [EXPRESSO] So do you not believe in a United States of 
Europe? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Certainly not. Not even in my 
grandchildren's time. 
  [EXPRESSO] How do you view the Portuguese parties' line in 
the elections to the European parliament, in which there is a 
clear retreat from the European ideals? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Unfortunately, I have heard a great deal of 
nonsense, even from politicians with senior posts in the 
parties. What must be considered, much more than potential 
concepts, dangers, or ideas which may exist, is the reality and 
knowing what the priorities are in Portugal. If they are our 
advancement in the world, our economic growth, trying to reach 
the Community average, the policies followed by the EU today are 
good for Portugal. 
  [EXPRESSO] What about your own party's line of returning to 
the traditional values of fatherland and family? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] Fatherland and family are essential concepts 
in our society, but they must be used not in a backward-looking 
perspective of nostalgia but one of progress. Otherwise, they 
will have a markedly conservative, not dynamic, content. 
  [EXPRESSO] Whom does Portugal back as Delors' successor? 
  [Deus Pinheiro] I have only exchanged views superficially 
and informally with the prime minister. It is not yet clear who 
the candidates are.

<F P=106> ["mue" report: "Finance Ministers Prohibit EU Greater </F>
Access to Capital Markets"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The European Commission is meeting with 
determined resistance from the finance and economics ministers 
from Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, and France with its 
financing projects, which it gives at 800 billion German marks 
[DM] for the next 15 years. At a weekend [9-10 April] meeting 
in Athens the economics and financial politicians of the 
European Union [EU], who are oriented toward stability, even 
ignored the inclination of the summit to permit the Commission 
to go to the capital markets and to drastically increase the 
financing of the European Investment Bank [EIB], which is 
already rising rapidly. 
  In the British delegation the catchword of a "new realism" 
in 
the EU was spreading, even though London Finance Secretary 
Kenneth Clarke did not claim to have coined this expression. 
Nevertheless, if Clarke and his Bonn counterpart Theo Waigel, 
as well as the central bank heads of the hard currency countries 
have their say, the time of great visions and, above all, of 
costly projects is over in the EU. 
  In Athens the Commission wanted to ensure that the EIB is 
permitted to expand substantially the financing of cross-border 
transportation routes via the capital market, going even beyond 
the current, already considerable amount. The officials from 
Brussels spoke of about DM400 billion by the end of the decade. 
Apart from that, the Commission hoped to get authorization to 
raise loans in its own name, for the time being for DM16 billion 
per year. 
  In December the summit ordered the finance ministers to 
benevolently examine whether the EU has need for additional 
financing. Waigel, however, noted categorically in Athens that 
such a need does not exist. The economics and financial 
politicians from Bonn are determined to prevent the Commission 
from going to the capital markets, because then, they are 
afraid, Brussels would open a second large-scale subsidy economy 
in excess of the already quite considerable EU budget. Waigel 
also questioned the connection between the investments in the 
"trans-European networks," which were outlined by the 
Commission, and economic growth. This connection had been 
established by Commission President Jacques Delors in the "White 
Paper on Growth, Employment, and Competitiveness." 
  In Athens it also became clear that a vision like the 
monetary union cannot be designed on the drawing board and 
carried out like a construction project, as was attempted in the 
Maastricht Treaty. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer stressed 
that the majority of the member states are meanwhile pursuing a 
policy of stability outside the rules of the European Monetary 
System (EMS), since the EMS is practically no longer in force as 
a result of the 30-percent expansion of the exchange rate 
fluctuation ranges. However, it is still considered to be the 
business foundation of the monetary union in line with the 
Maastricht Treaty. 
<H5>  No Central Bank Function </H5>
  Furthermore, Tietmeyer stresses that no member state has so 
far entrusted currency reserves to the European Monetary 
Institute (EMI). He once again made it clear that the 
institute, which was founded in Frankfurt at the beginning of 
the year, must not interpret the Maastricht Treaty expansively, 
which means it should not exercise any function that is similar 
to that of a central bank. It has to limit itself to the 
technical preparation of the future European central bank. 
Tietmeyer indicated that the EMI is not really the germinating 
cell of a future European central bank, but will remain a "think 
tank." In Athens it became clear that, in the end, it is those 
countries that unite for the monetary union which, independent 
of the Maastricht Treaty, have developed a strong currency on 
their own and come together in the common interest.

<F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "Covert Game for Power"] </F>
  [Text] Greece is planning a new airport for its capital 
Athens. It is part of the 26 projects chosen by the European 
Commission for the expansion of the "European transportation 
networks." The Commission considers no less than 250 airports 
to be "of European interest," which means they are worthy of 
being financially supported. Greece probably does not enjoy 
enough credit on the capital markets to finance such a project. 
Thus, the European Union [EU] in Brussels is supposed to help 
-- to a small degree with subsidies from its budget, primarily, 
however, with the excellent credit standing of its European 
Investment Bank (EIB). 
  By the end of the decade the Brussels authority wants to 
raise more than 400 billion German marks [DM] in this way for 
the traffic infrastructure in the EU -- DM800 billion over the 
next 15 years, and more than DM1 trillion if electricity and 
telephone lines are added. One cannot reproach the officials in 
Brussels for looking in the direction of their Mecca, that is, 
Paris, or for thinking up a new label in the form of the 
"trans-European networks," with which they hoped to intensify 
the redistribution toward the south. There is also a lot going 
to Germany, for instance new east-west links for high-speed 
trains. It is in particular this unbiased attitude that bothers 
some member states. When the finance ministers examined the list 
of projects in Athens on the weekend, the Italian minister 
protested against the financing plans for the east-west 
direction. Rather, the EU should concentrate on the traffic 
infrastructure at its periphery, which also includes the Italian 
boot. 
  Thus, redistribution after all? The officials in Brussels 
have long aroused greed with their plans, and now FRG Finance 
Minister Theo Waigel and others have to recapture the genie that 
has been let out of the bottle. The EU, quite certainly, has 
not been passive so far. Last year alone the EIB provided loans 
of more than DM15 billion for traffic, energy, and 
telecommunications networks. Therefore, the officials in 
Brussels are not simply interested in even more capital but in 
making traffic investments in the member states a matter of the 
EU as soon as national borders are crossed. The issue is 
authority and thus power. In this connection, it is quite 
appropriate that the EU has forced its member states to save 
money, a constraint by which it does not consider itself bound. 
If the governments want to fulfill the criteria for qualifying 
for the monetary union, they have no room for further deficits. 
Brussels, on the other hand, would enter deficit management on 
a grand scale.

Rwanda"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- "The European 
Commission (EC) unblocked emergency aid worth ECU500,000 (20 
million Belgian francs) to help the victims of the fresh wave of 
interethnic violence that is sweeping through the country," 
announced a EC spokesman on Monday [11 April]. 
  This aid would go toward the dispatching of medical and 
surgical equipment to be placed at the disposal of teams of 
Belgian "Medecins Sans Frontieres" [Doctors Wtihout Borders] who 
are already there on the ground. 
  "This equipment was already sent on its way Saturday from 
Rotterdam airport," specified the spokesman. "In fact, it would 
be the first of several consignments of emergency aid which 
would follow in the days or weeks to come," he added. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Feels Russian Accession </F>
to EU To Be Unrealistic"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 06 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- Although no 
formal conclusions were drawn at the brain-storming meeting held 
by the European Commission on Wednesday [6 April] to examine 
relations with the Republics of the CIS (former U.S.S.R.), 
observers believe that the commissioners did reach some general 
conclusions. As expected, the commissioner's study focused 
mainly on relations with Russia. This was based on discussion 
notes by Mr. Christophersen, Sir Leon Brittan, and Mr. Van den 
Broek and on a memorandum on industrial policy by Mr. Bangemann 
(who is in the United States), as well as technical annexes. 
Although no information was made public on the results of the 
seminar, EUROPE has reason to believe that: 

  -  All of the 
Commissioners who spoke felt that it was not realistic for 
Russia or the other CIS Republics to consider joining the 
European Union [EU]; 
  -  Therefore, efforts should focus on how 
cooperation between the [European] Union and these countries can 
be strengthened; 
  -  Economic cooperation should be both bilateral 
(by means of different agreements the Union has already 
concluded or is envisaging with the different republics) and 
multilateral in nature, notably through improvement of the TACIS 
programme [Technical Assistance Program for the Republics of the 
Former U.S.S.R.]. This programme should be made 
multiannual; 
  -  Political cooperation should include stepped-up 
political dialogue, which, in particular with Russia, should be 
wide-ranging and systematic; 
  -  A certain degree of cooperation 
should not be excluded in areas covered by the "third pillar" of 
the Treaty of Maastricht (home and justice affairs) in specific 
sectors, such as efforts to combat drugs and organized crime and 
monitoring of the recycling of dirty money. Several 
commissioners highlighted the scope of industrial cooperation 
(see the example of aluminium with Russia) and scientific 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Lionel Barber report: "EU in Grip of New Monetary Realism"] </F>
  [Text] Athens -- The ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism] is 
dead, long live the ERM. This might be an appropriate epitaph 
to the two-day meeting of European finance ministers and central 
bankers in Athens, which ended on Saturday [9 April]. 
  Barely a word passed about the old exchange rate mechanism, 
still less was there any talk about how to restore the narrow 
fluctuation bands for EU [European Union] currencies -- the 
cause for which billions of dollars and several political 
reputations were lost in 1992-93. 
  Plainly, the 15 percent fluctuation bands in operation since 
the collapse of the ERM last August have won converts. Mr Hans 
Tietmeyer Bundesbank president, was not alone in defending a 
system which no longer imposes obligations on the strong to 
intervene to prop up weaker currencies, but which has still 
encouraged the old "hard-core" currencies (Benelux and the 
French franc) to cluster around the D-Mark [German mark]. 
  The "dirty float" has given everyone a respite from the 
speculators, but it still raises questions about the European 
Union's road-map to a single currency by the end of the decade. 
The old plan of moving to European monetary union [EMU] using 
the discipline of narrow bands to move progressively to fixed 
exchange rates looks out of date. So what comes next? 
  Athens ducked this question but one senior EU official 
predicted that ministers would have to take decisions before the 
end of the year if the earliest date for EMU -- 1997 -- was to 
remain credible. 
  The most important concerns the interpretation of the 
Maastricht Treaty, specifically article 109J which covers the 
criteria on inflation, budget deficits, interest and exchange 
rates necessary to qualify for EMU. 
  The Treaty says that member states must respect "normal" 
margins of fluctuation within the ERM for at least two years, 
and that there must be no devaluations. But what is "normal" 
now that the ERM exists in name alone? 
  One option is to judge member states' exchange rate 
performance against the central rate as represented by the ECU; 
but this would impose a tougher standard than the old 2.25 per 
cent fluctuation inside the narrow ERM bands, said one official. 
  Meantime, the accent is on each member state taking the 
necessary corrective action to bring their economies into line. 
  Mr Kenneth Clarke, British chancellor of the exchequer, may 
be criticised for his tax rises in the UK; but in Greece he was 
happy to stand alongside Mr Theo Waigel, his German counterpart, 
as the fearless pruner of budget deficits. 
  Nor was the mood too sombre in Athens. One senior official 
noted that for the first time in at least two years there was a 
widespread feeling that the European economy may be moving 
decisively into recovery. 
  If there was a fear, it was that the recent upward pressure 
on U.S. interest rates could cross the Atlantic, dashing hopes 
that the downward trend on the continent will continue. 
  Despite misleading suggestions from the Greek delegation, 
this did not translate into an appeal to the Bundesbank to 
accelerate cuts in short-term rates. 
  "Everybody realises that this is counterproductive," an 
official said. 
  This realisation suggests a new realism about monetary 
union. 
It also underlines the extent to which the central banks are in 
the driving seat.

  [Text] Athens (DPA) -- Finance Minister Theo Waigel has 
called for a single concept for creating "lasting growth and 
employment dynamism" in the European Union [EU]. According to 
members of delegations at the meeting with his EU counterparts 
in Athens on Friday [8 April], Waigel said he supported the 
strategy paper that was presented by the European Commission, 
the so-called white paper. However, he sees a danger that the 
important impulses in terms of economic policy that are 
contained in the document "threaten to fall apart." 
  Waigel warned that a policy to secure growth and employment 
must not only concentrate on measures related to infrastructure. 
The extension of the trans-European networks -- at the level of 
transport, telecommunications, and energy--are important, but it 
is not sufficient yet. 
  In concrete terms, Waigel requested that the growth 
perspectives be urgently improved and the burden on enterprises 
as a result of over regulation be reduced. Wage policy to 
secure employment must contribute to this objective. The 
efficiency and dynamism of the economy continue to meet too many 
obstacles, particularly excessive and ever more complicated 
regulations. Waigel suggested that a deregulation group be 
established at the EU level to reduce bureaucracy. Such a group 
should thin out EU laws and free them of "over regulation that 
obstructs investment." 
  In Athens, the finance ministers also wanted to discuss the 
controversial funding of growth programs for the economy in the 
Union. The Twelve and the European Commission are at odds 
whether parts of the equivalent of almost 39 billion German 
marks, which have been earmarked for investments into the 
trans-European networks, should also be financed via credits. 
In addition, the president of the European Monetary Institute 
(EMI, Frankfurt), Alexandre Lamfalussy, wanted to brief the 
group of ministers on the efforts to establish the newly created 
institute and recent developments in the European Monetary 
System.

<F P=106> [Andrew Marshal report: "Europe Divided on Single Currency"] </F>
  [Text] Athens -- Britain's view of monetary union is 
prevailing, Kenneth Clarke [Chancellor of the Exchequer] said 
yesterday, as fresh splits emerged over Europe's path to a 
single currency. 
  Finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in 
Athens clashed over how the European Monetary System [EMS] 
should be put back on track, and how to progress towards 
European Monetary Union [EMU]. "I think I am in the mainstream 
of finance ministers from the bigger countries who make the 
running," the Chancellor told BBC radio afterwards. 
  Germany and France oppose moving rapidly back to narrow 
bands 
in the EMS after last year's crisis which nearly destroyed the 
system. Belgium and Denmark have led some of the smaller 
countries in pushing for a return to the tighter disciplines of 
the EMS. But Mr Clarke said "I don't think they were major 
players here today." 
  French sources said a return to narrow bands would have to 
await lower inflation in Germany. Hans Tietmeyer, the 
Bundesbank president, said that inflation was still too high at 
3.2 per cent. 
  The Chancellor said that despite Britain's recent European 
problems, opinion on monetary matters was moving in the 
Government's favour. "The whole tenor of the discussion has 
changed," he said. "I am totally in the mainstream of discussion 
here." 
  Britain's scepticism about the timetabled path to a single 
currency through the disciplines of the EMS is now shared by 
France and Germany, but opposed by other smaller states. The 
dispute is likely to intensify as the year goes on and public 
discussion on monetary union and the EMS resumes. 
  Alexandre Lamfalussy, head of the European Monetary 
Institute, wants the convergence of Europe's economies to be 
given pre-eminence rather than a timetabled approach. But the 
smaller states want to push the pace by giving Europe's 
embryonic central bank new powers over monetary policy and 
tightening co-ordination. 
  Officials in Athens said there had been tough talking 
including a mini-revolt by the governors of the larger central 
banks, especially Mr Tietmeyer. The Bundesbank president 
underlined that countries were responsible for their own 
monetary policy, reaffirmed the German central bank's 
independence and resisted pressure for interest rate cuts. 
  The Chancellor also announced that the Channel tunnel rail 
link will be one of the first schemes to be funded under new 
European Union [EU] transport plans. It is one of lO projects 
to be given priority in the construction of Trans-European 
Networks, large-scale infrastructure connections. 
  Ministers discussed how the EU could work with private 
capital for these projects, with estimates that a total of ECU20 
billion (15 billion pounds) a year will be needed from European 
funds. Of this, ECU8 billion has yet to be found. 
  However, Mr Clarke continued to resist the idea of allowing 
the European Commission to borrow money so that it could lend 
cash itself. "There was", he said, "continued doubt about the 
need for any new financial instrument and for the union to raise 
extra money through bonds." But Britain's resistance to the 
Commission's infrastructure plans, contained in a white paper 
presented last year by Jacques Delors, is much reduced. "Now 
we've got down to the detail, we're making more sensible 
decisions," Mr Clarke said. 
  The informal meeting was meant to discuss measures to 
promote 
European growth through infrastructure projects, funding for 
Central and East Europe, as well as the new European monetary 
institute. But debate over monetary and interest rate matters, 
including behind the scenes discussion about how to resurrect 
the EMS, dominated the gathering. 
  In the past few weeks there has been increasing debate about 
what steps need to be taken to put Europe back on track for a 
single currency by 1997. But the monetary disasters of the past 
two years have instilled caution in Europe's biggest monetary 
players, France and Germany, and views about the Maastricht 
treaty's route to a single currency have shifted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Establishes PHARE </F>
Programme of Cross-Border Cooperation With East Europe"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 07 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- This 
Wednesday [6 April], the European Commission established a 
programme of cross-border cooperation, within the framework of 
the PHARE [Poland-Hungary: Actions for Economic Reconversion] 
programme, between the member states of the [European] Community 
and the countries of Central and East Europe. This will include 
the Eastern countries which have common borders with Community 
member states; the Baltic States will be included based on a 
broad interpretation of the concept of "maritime borders." In 
practice, three Central and East European countries will remain 
outside this programme, as they have no common border with the 
[European] Union [EU]. They are: Hungary, the Slovak Republic 
and Romania. However, the first two will have a common border 
with the EU once Austria joins; then Romania will be the only 
East European country to be excluded, and its case will require 
special consideration. It should be pointed out that the 
Commission was not able to include the FYROM [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--Skopje] in the list of countries 
eligible for this programme because the Council would not allow 
it to be included among the PHARE programme beneficiaries (due 
to opposition from Greece). The situation could, of course, 
change later on. The new programme, which will have ECU150 
million in funding for 1994 is being set up at the initiative of 
the European Parliament. Its objective is to promote structural 
actions in the regions of the Central and East European 
countries which border on the Community and are eligible for 
PHARE; in the Community member states, such actions will be 
co-financed by the structural funds, notably by INTERREG II 
[Community Initiative concerning border areas]. Thus, projects 
in the PHARE framework will be implemented in accordance with 
structural policies, with INTERREG in particular. The 
objectives of the new programme were largely based on programmes 
of cross-border cooperation carried out by the Community. The 
eligible projects are also nearly identical to those found in 
the context of INTERREG II, and include, first of all, measures 
for the development of infrastructures; secondly, there will be 
various measures in the economic, social and technical spheres 
aimed at promoting cross-border cooperation. The process of 
identifying joint projects has already been kicked off by a 
number of meetings between representatives from the countries of 
Central and East Europe, the countries having borders with the 
EU, and the Commission services. For some countries, a number 
of projects affecting about three-quarters of the available 
budget were identified. The draft regulation on the new 
programme will be sent for information to the European 
Parliament, the ESC [Economic and Social Committee] and the 
Committee of Regions and will be presented to the Management 
Committee in April, in view of its final adoption by the 
Commission in light of this Committee's opinion.

  [Text] Athens (DPA) -- In order to stimulate the economy, 
the European Union [EU] will participate in financing two 
express train tracks in Germany. During a meeting in Athens on 
Friday [8 April] the EU finance ministers basically agreed on 10 
large-scale projects in the field of trans-European traffic 
networks, telecommunications, and energy, which are to be pushed 
ahead as a priority. However, according to FRG Finance Minister 
Theo Waigel, the financing of the project must not be achieved 
via loans. 
  Waigel said in Athens that two German projects were included 
on the list, which can be implemented quickly. Thus, ICE 
[Intercity Express] high-speed tracks from west to east and from 
south to north are to be expanded. According to available 
information, these are the lines from France via Strasbourg, 
Karlsruhe, and Frankfurt to Berlin and the south-north axis from 
Milan via the Brenner Pass to Munich, Nuremberg, Halle, and 
Berlin to Warsaw. 
  Brussels' exact share in the construction projects, which 
involve billions, are yet to be determined at future ministers' 
meetings. However, the financing of investments in the networks 
must not be achieved via loans, Waigel said. "Financing via 
loans raised by the commission is out of the question," the 
minister said. No new debts must be incurred. 
  According to Waigel, Germany, France, and Great Britain 
reject the idea that the commission can get money on the capital 
markets via so-called Euro Funds. The minister added: "It is 
the clear line of most countries: no new instruments." Existing 
EU budget means, as well as those in the form of guarantees and 
loans of the European Investment Bank must be sufficient. 
  In order to overcome the economic crisis in the EU the 
Commission had presented a strategy paper (white paper) to the 
partners and there also suggested the expansion of the networks. 
As a result, the EU states decided to allocate ECU5 billion 
from the EU budget and ECU7 billion in the form of leans from 
the European Investment Bank every year for the next six years 
for this purpose. The finance ministers should clarify how the 
additionally necessary means of ECU8 billion can be raised. 
  Waigel warned that a policy to safeguard growth and 
employment must not concentrate solely on infrastructure 
measures. It is urgently necessary to improve the prospects for 
growth in Europe and reduce the burdens on the companies created 
by excessive regulations. In addition, wage policy must 
contribute to safeguarding employment.

  [Text] Vienna, April 11 (CTK) -- Although Austria is now 
surrounded by democratic states, near its borders lies a region 
of latent instability and uncertainty, whose spread could be 
prevented by cooperation in the Central European region, 
Austrian President Thomas Klestil told CTK today. 
  He said he was mainly referring to local military conflicts 
in Austria's vicinity, and other phenomena threatening 
stability, such as uncontrolled mass migration, international 
crime, drug trafficking, and threats to the environment by, for 
example, transit freight transport or nuclear power plants. 
  "That is why Austria is highly interested in further 
strengthening of security and stability in Central Europe," 
Klestil said. 
  He also said he favored the closest possible Austrian-Czech 
relations. In view of Austria's forthcoming membership in the 
European Union (EU), Klestil said he supported the EU's future 
extension to Central Europe's post-communist countries. "Austria 
ranks among the resolute advocates of the quickest possible 
expansion of the EU to the east," he said, adding that if a 
referendum on Austria's joining the EU has a positive result, 
Austria would, as a EU member, "defend the interests of all 
these countries."

<F P=106> ["SVD" report: "Mr. Di Rupo Confirms Protection Operation"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 9 Apr (BELGA) -- As the C-130's fly off 
from Melsbroek military airport Saturday morning [9 April], Elio 
di Rupo, vice prime minister and communications minister, also 
confirmed Saturday morning that the government has indeed 
decided to protect Belgian citizens from Rwanda. 
  "For the moment, the government's prime concern is to get 
everything in place to protect Belgian Nationals, as the French 
and the Americans are doing," declared Mr. Di Rupo to [Belgian 
French-speaking] RTBF radio. Without mentioning the number of 
paratroopers which will leave Belgium, nor their destination, Di 
Rupo confirmed that the government decided that "there will 
indeed be an operation and that this operation will continue." 
  The vice prime minister considers that it is up to the 
General Staff and the military in the field to assess the 
situation. "The government has a political responsibility. The 
decision was made to contact UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
and the United Nations. The military must do their job now," the 
vice prime minister added. 
  Since the country is geographically far from Belgium, the 
minister specified that "it was not an operation of few hours, 
but that it would take several days." 
  Regarding potential plans for lodging Belgian nationals 
willing to evacuate from Rwanda, the minister confirmed that all 
sanitary measures were taken. "For the rest," the minister 
added, "we will estimate the situation in the next couple of 
hours. At the moment, our concern is to protect the life of our 
nationals," the minister reiterated. 
  With regard to the eight C-130 Hercules aircraft and the two 
Boeings 727 (adapted to carry 120 passengers) of the Belgian Air 
Force which are stationed on Melsbroek airport, five had already 
left for an unknown destination at 1000 hours on Saturday.

Several Days,' Says Delcroix"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- "I hope that the 
evacuation of Belgian nationals in Rwanda will be completed in 
three or four days," Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix 
stated on Monday morning [11 April]. "The timing of the 
operation, known as Silver Back, depends however on local 
security conditions," he added on BRTN [Dutch-language Belgian 
Radio and Television] radio. 
  The minister also confirmed that the first plane bringing 
Belgians home from Kigali is expected in Melsbroek during the 
night of Monday to Tuesday. This plane is due to leave the 
Rwandan capital at around 1000 GMT on Monday, traveling first to 
Nairobi (Kenya) and arriving in Belgium during the night (at 
around 2300 GMT, according to a Sabena spokesman -- editor's 
note). 
  Priority is now being given to the evacuation of Belgians 
living in the interior of the country. Belgian paratroopers aim 
to assemble the Belgian nationals at Kigali airport throughout 
Monday, and possibly Tuesday. Belgians living in the capital 
have already assembled. 
  The minister also pointed out that the Belgian blue helmets 
have been charged with taking part in the evacuation operation. 
  Finally, he confirmed that both civil and military 
cooperation with Rwanda would probably be reviewed after the 
evacuation. He added that this question will be on the agenda 
of the government and Parliament in the coming weeks.

<F P=106> [Article signed JPH/KVB: "Netherlands Police Issues Radio </F>
Warning to Illegal Immigrants"] 
  [Text] Rotterdam, 5 Apr (ANP) -- The Netherlands police 
broadcast an advisory on Italy's Radio Milan to Pakistanis not 
to come to the Netherlands for a residence permit. The 
broadcast was in response to the arrival Tuesday morning [5 
April] at the Rotterdam aliens police office of 1,000 illegal 
Pakistani immigrants, who attempted to obtain permits. They 
came from Italy, Belgium, France, and Germany. 
  According to a spokesman for the Rotterdam-Rijnmond police, 
attempts are being made to broadcast such appeals in the 
countries of origin of the illegal immigrants. "We want to 
reach as many people as possible through the media," the 
spokesman said. In its English-language broadcast, the 
Netherlands world service also has devoted some attention to the 
matter. 
  The Rotterdam police have learned from several illegal 
immigrants that they paid unspecified fees to be transported to 
Rotterdam. 
  The first Pakistanis arrived in Rotterdam on Monday. They 
had travelled by bus from France and were stopped on Coolsingel 
Avenue. Ten of them were expelled from the country on Tuesday. 
"That is still a viable operation, but we cannot take 1,000 
people and expel them," the police spokesman said. 
  The Rotterdam aliens police is drawing up a pamphlet which 
explains in various languages that it is no longer possible to 
obtain a residence permit in the Netherlands. Since 1 April, 
applications for permits of this kind must be submitted to the 
Netherlands Embassy or Consulate in the country of origin. The 
pamphlets will be hung up outside the police station. There are 
also plans to allow police in the country's three other major 
cities to use the pamphlet. 
  The confusion may have arisen as a result of the tightening 
up of the Law on Aliens on 1 April. The law now stipulates that 
for any stay in the Netherlands longer than three months, aliens 
must apply for a temporary residence permit in their country of 
origin. A fee is charged for such applications. After they 
have arrived in the Netherlands, the aliens must still apply for 
a temporary residence permit. 
  According to the Netherlands Center for Foreigners (NCB), 
the 
Justice Ministry made a mistake in its announcement on the new 
legislation. The immigrants know far too little about it and 
are spreading rumors. Furthermore, the fact that applications 
have to be paid for is probably leading many aliens to believe 
they can simply buy a residence permit. The NCB claims that at 
the same time justice officials are showing no interest in 
helping the foreigners understand the complicated new 
legislation. 
  Secretary of State for Justice Kosto rejected the criticism 
on Tuesday. He claims that the NCB has been involved in the 
information campaign all along and that information material is 
available in seven different languages. "However, if people do 
not wish to believe the information and jump at any opportunity 
they can to obtain a residence permit, then there is not much we 
can do about it," Kosto said. According to Kosto, aliens who 
knew they were residing here without a permit thought that they 
could set things straight.

<F P=106> [Patricia Wynn Davies article: "Major Regrets `Shopping </F>
Society' Image"] 
  [Text] The Government and the Conservative Party give the 
impression that materialism and a "shopping society" are 
overriding values, John Major admitted yesterday. 
  He also said he recognised that there was more to life than 
politics, and that politics was far from being the most 
important thing for individuals or the country. 
  The Prime Minister accepted in an interview with a Sunday 
newspaper that his concentration on economic policy had left the 
widespread impression that his administration had no vision of 
Britain beyond that of a "shopping" society. 
  "It does and I regret that. It does give that impression and 
it makes it look as though the Government and the Tory party are 
too materialistic," he told THE MAIL ON SUNDAY. 
  "Most emphatically it does that and I regret that very much 
because those are not the other aims I have, they just happened 
to be the bedrock on which you build the other aims," he said. 
  Although a strong economy was the key to good defence, the 
welfare state, improved education and law and order, "I believe 
also that you do have to try to retain a quality of life that in 
many ways is more important than the simple accretion of 
personal wealth or personal influence," he said. 
  The frank admissions came as Mr Major set his face against 
"appeasing" his critics, vowing that he would not change his 
leadership style, policies or objectives, and they can be seen 
as setting him apart from right-wing Thatcherite critics within 
Government and on the Tory back benches. 
  But Jack Straw, Labour spokesman on the environment, said 
"What this blinding admission shows is that there is a black 
hole at the heart of the Major ideology." 
  "Modern Tories are materialistic, or nothing. Over the past 
15 years their pitch -- and his -- has been to put the 
acquisition of wealth above all. It has not led to improvements 
for those who are poor. It has led to a deeply divided society." 
  Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat economics spokesman, said: 
"The plaintiff cry, `I didn't really want it to end up like 
this,' will fool nobody." 
  Mr Major signalled a dogged determination not to be unseated 
in the wake of his latest confidence crisis while dismissing as 
"patently ludicrous" the claim that next month's council 
elections will be a referendum on his leadership. 
  While he "admired greatly" the achievements of Baroness 
Thatcher, he said: "It is no good clinging to exactly the same 
things that were right in the Eighties. These are the Nineties; 
something different is needed now." 
  But displaying what some political critics might view as a 
penchant for saying the wrong thing, or at least awkward timing, 
he went on: "Life is very rounded. It isn't just about politics 
and neither is politics the most important part of it.... It 
isn't for this country. I fear for some opinion formers it is 
becoming the most important thing, and I regret this very much." 
  Mr Major might well have tapped the sympathies of numbers of 
ordinary voters with that statement, but he might well also have 
alarmed some Tory constituency activists faced with the uphill 
task of motivating an apathetic electorate in the run up to the 
local elections and the 9 June European Parliament contests.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister John Major by Chris </F>
Buckland; place and date not given: "Major: I Won't Be Pushed 
Out"] 
  [Text] John Major last night turned on his critics with a 
robust determination to carry on as Prime Minister, declaring: 
"I am not going to walk away." 
  And he added: "I expect to lead the Conservative Party into 
the next election and beyond." 
  Mr Major also had a warning for supporters of Cabinet 
colleagues hoping to replace him if he "falls under a bus." 
  He said: "I am very careful crossing the road. I do not 
expect a traffic accident." 
  The Premier was speaking in an exclusive Daily Express 
interview on the week he celebrates the second anniversary of 
his surprise 1992 general election victory. 
  On the eve of today's tax rises for millions of voters, Mr 
Major admitted he would carry on with policies which were 
"almost impossible to defend now" but right for Britain in the 
long term. 
  He attacked the small band of critics who had called for his 
resignation, describing them as "incorrigible when put in front 
of a microphone." 
  He revealed that despite reports Lady Thatcher was opposing 
a 
leadership challenge, he had not spoken to her for some time. 
  Mr Major was buoyed by his warm reception from senior party 
officials of all constituencies in the pivotal Essex area, where 
support for the Tories is vital if they are to win the next 
election. At the end of his one-day visit to the county 
including Basildon, the symbol of his election triumph, the 
Premier spelt out his political philosophy declaring: "If you 
are doing something you care about you don't lightly put it 
aside. It Isn't a matter of personal position or ambition. 
That is not the first thing on my mind, not remotely." 
  He was committed to the policies being carried out for the 
country adding "I'm not going to walk away from it." Asked how 
long it would be before public support returned to the Tories, 
he pointed out the next election need not be until the summer of 
1997. 
  "One year before the last election when I had just taken 
over, we were 20 points behind and we won by seven points." 
  He again predicted Britain would grow by 2 and l/2 per cent 
economically this year. 
  And the effects of the new tax increases would be "only a 
fraction of the figure Labour is using." He pledged to lower 
taxes but did not know when. He was "unmoved by the criticism" 
he was subject to and he rejected the idea he was a weak leader. 
"We have Cabinet Government -- that is the way democracy works 
in this Country and I'm not going to argue with that." 
  Mr Major's tough fight back came after one of the blackest 
weeks of his premiership. 
  A survey showed that while most Tory MPs supported him, 41 
out of 100 questioned thought he would not be leader at the next 
general election. Three MPs on the "eccentric" wing of the 
party openly called on him to go. According to a new sounding 
taken yesterday, more than half the people of Basildon want Mr 
Major to step down. A poll carried out for GMTV [Good Morning 
Television] showed 54 per cent in favour of him, 26 per cent 
against and 19 did not know.

<F P=106> [Michael White report: "Poll Suggests Fatal Blow to Major </F>
Regime"] 
  [Text] The Conservatives intensified their strident spring 
election offensive yesterday in the face of growing evidence 
that Labour and the Liberal Democrats are poised to inflict 
potentially fatal humiliations on John Major's embattled regime. 
  While the Prime Minister endured a bumpy ride in Birmingham, 
which the Tories see as their best hope of municipal victory on 
May 5, a Mori poll for today's Times suggests that they could 
win as few as eight seats in European elections a month later, 
against 66 for Labour and 10 for the Liberal Democrats. Such an 
outcome on June 9 might trigger a crisis of confidence that 
could topple Mr Major. 
  But the Mori poll is highly tentative with even Labour 
treating it with scepticism. "We cannot win 66 seats," said a 
senior official. 
  On overall voting intentions, Mori places Labour at 48 per 
cent, the Tories at 28, and the Lib Dems at 21. 
  Yesterday Mr Major and his cabinet lieutenants struggled to 
make the local elections a referendum on their opponents, 
municipal records, and tried to undo the offence caused in 
Labour-controlled Birmingham by an abrasive Tory election 
broadcast last week. After being accused of "throwing muck," at 
the whole city, Mr Major felt obliged to explain "I'm not 
bashing Brum [Birmingham]." 
  As Labour hammered away at this week's higher council tax 
rates and joined the Liberal Democrats in urging voters to "cast 
a verdict on the Prime Minister and his policies," Tory 
headquarters reinforced its high-risk strategy of taking the war 
into the enemy camp. 
  It dispatched Michael Portillo to trumpet the cost-cutting 
achievements of Westminster council, the flagship authority 
whose 245 pound Band D council tax is Britain's lowest and whose 
housing policies are under financial investigation. 
  "It is no coincidence that the council which has produced 
the 
lowest council tax in the country is also the one which has led 
the way in contracting out its services to the private sector," 
the Treasury's Chief Secretary declared as Westminster 
councillors brushed aside questions about gerrymandering and 
issued a 32-page manifesto. 
  Westminster, the symbol of Thatcherism in the 1990 local 
elections, would go Labour for the first time on an unlikely 10 
per cent swing. In a BBC Radio interview, Mr Portillo praised 
the council's clean streets and smart estates. But Labour's 
Frank Dobson said it was quite extraordinary that a minister 
should identify with such a controversial regime whose 
achievements rested on financial favouritism from Whitehall. 
  After a run of disastrous local election results, the Tory 
strategy in 1994 is emerging as a rerun of their 1992 general 
election campaign: to neutralise criticism by hurling similar 
charges back at their critics. It points to a dirty contest. 
  The Times poll represents an aggregated analysis of voting 
intentions among 11,841 adults interviewed between January and 
March. The figures exclude undecided voters (7 per cent) and 
those not planning to vote (9 per cent).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Loyalists Prepare for `Long War'"] </F>
  [Text] The IRA'S three-day ceasefire was described as an 
irrelevance yesterday by the Ulster Defence Association [UDA], 
which said it was now working to its own agenda to prevent 
Ulster from sliding inexorably into a united Ireland. 
  In a wide-ranging interview with two senior representatives 
claiming to be leaders of the UDA's south Belfast and southeast 
Antrim battalions -- the first since the Downing Street 
Declaratlon last December -- it emerged that the illegal 
loyalist organisation has been studying IRA strategy and is 
planning for a "long war." 
  "Our days of reacting to the IRA are over. As far as we are 
concerned our agenda is pro-active." 
  The wooing of the IRA by the British and Irish Governments 
was proof that violence pays, the men said. 
  "The view from our community is that they've bombed our 
towns 
and killed our people for 25 years and the British Government is 
saying, `Hold on, we don't want any more 3 million pound bombs 
in the centre of London.' There is a strong feeling of 
alienation within our community." 
  The UDA had adopted long and short-term policies against 
what 
it calls the pan-nationalist front -- the IRA, Sinn Fein, the 
Social and Democratic Labour Party [SDLP] and the Irish 
Government -- they said. "We are planning for a long effort. 
Our volunteers are more than capable of carrying on the role of 
defenders of our way of life, and as far as we're concerned we 
are quite prepared for the long haul." 
  The men said that given the recent political developments 
they believed there was a grim future ahead. "The ingredients 
are there for it. I think civil war gets nearer by the month 
and that's not war-mongering, that's fact." 
  The restraint with which the UDA had responded to the IRA's 
temporary suspension of activities was proof that it was no 
longer simply reacting to republican violence. "We have our own 
agenda. Even if there was a permanent cessation of violence 
from the IRA it doesn't mean to say we would cause a cessation 
of our own policies because there's still the other major 
problem of another state on this island laying claim to the 
territory of Northern Ireland." 
  The senior UDA figures said that any extension of the IRA's 
ceasefire would be taken as a sign that its terms had been met 
by the Government. "There must be a prize for the IRA to call a 
ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked 
at." 
  Neither man had any doubt that secret talks between the IRA 
and the Government were continuing and that Sinn Fein would 
receive the clarification it was seeking. "There's a thin line 
between dialogue and negotiation. The IRA want to know what 
comes next, what are steps two, three and four. But we would 
like to know that too." The UDA was developing its political 
agenda: a working group was meeting to fuse two loyalist 
blueprints, "Beyond the Religious Divide" and "Commonsense." 
The new policy document, setting out proposals for an 
independent Ulster within the framework of the European Union, 
would be published within the next two months, they said. 
  The leaders said they realised that the British Government 
no 
longer wanted Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom, 
but they were heartened by other support -- not identified -- on 
the mainland for the survival of the Union. Politically they 
would prefer to remain within the UK but the alternative was 
independence. 
  "We've a great deal of faith in our own ability. We are a 
very independent people. There are people within Northern 
Ireland who are more than capable of running this country and we 
have no doubt that the day is fast coming when those leaders 
will come to the fore." 
  The UDA wanted all the constitutional politicians in 
Northern 
Ireland to sit round the same table, settle their differences 
and work out new arrangements for its governance. As a gesture 
of good faith, two years ago loyalist paramilitaries had called 
a three-month ceasefire to allow a similar exercise -- known as 
the Brooke talks -- which had been scuppered by the SDLP. 
  They believed the majority of nationalists would accept an 
internal settlement. Those who did not were entitled to pursue 
their aspiration for a united Ireland through democratic means, 
"not through the barrel of a gun." 
  One of the men said: "I think people will progress out of 
that. We are all inter-dependent within the confines of Europe. 
Most of the legislation will be emanating from Brussels, so I 
think the majority of people will have moved on, not clawing 
themselves into that `little island' mentality. 
  ``Personally I want to be part and parcel of a greater 
social 
and economic entity and I'll work with anybody to achieve that 
as long as they don't lay unconstitutional claims on my 
country.'' 
  The men denied that their aims were sectarian. "We've no 
problems whatsoever with integrated education. That would be a 
barrier removed, but the main opponent to that is the Catholic 
Church. There's other aspects of the Catholic community that we 
have no problem living with at all. As far as we're concerned 
the cause of the confiict is the IRA." 
  By pursuing the current political goals the Irish Government 
was "giving a reason for the IRA to continue." There would be a 
price to pay, the men warned. "They haven't paid it yet, but 
all their dues are being recorded and they will have to pay up." 
  Asked whether they would be prepared to talk to John Hume, 
as 
the SDLP leader has suggested, the UDA representatives said 
there was no merit in the idea. "John Hume will never have our 
trust, he will never convince the loyalist community that he is 
genuine. He's past his sell-by date and it's time some other 
politician emerged to take his place." 
  Mr Hume had led the SDLP down a road which "we believe a 
number of people within his party didn't want to go down." His 
removal would allow the election of a new leader with whom 
loyalists were certain they could work. 
  Asked to assess the UDA's present strength and level of 
support, the men said: "We've recruits coming in daily who are 
prepared to come into the organisation, and we are very pleased 
with the amount of assistance that we're getting from people who 
would share our views but would perhaps not be prepared to join 
us and can give us support in other ways."

<F P=106> [Colin Brown and Tom Wilkie report: "Nuclear Sale `Could Be </F>
Put on Back Burner'"] 
  [Text] The 2 billion pound privatisation of the nuclear 
power industry could be put on hold following a decision by 
ministers that they will need primary legislation to float the 
assets of Nuclear Electric on the market. 
  The Government is under pressure to include a Bill in the 
Queen's Speech in the autumn. Any further delay could end the 
privatisation chances, and would be seen as evidence that the 
crisis of confidence in John Major's leadership has led to a 
loss of nerve. 
  In a second blow to the nuclear industry's hopes, a shadow 
has been cast over the future of the two nuclear reactors it is 
proposing to build at Sizewell in Suffolk, adjacent to Britain's 
first pressurised water reactor, Sizewell-B, which will start 
generating in the late summer. Tomorrow, Suffolk's planning 
officer is expected to recommend to the county council that it 
should oppose the 3bn pound development because the Government's 
nuclear policy is unclear. 
  Nuclear Electric plc is privately lobbying ministers to give 
the go-ahead for its privatisation without legislation. 
Officials have told ministers that the Government is 
technically entitled to do so. Nuclear Electric was set up as a 
private company owned by the Government after electricity 
privatisation because the costs of nuclear waste disposal and 
decommissioning old reactors made it unsaleable. Some leaders 
in the nuclear industry fear any delay until after the next 
general election, because they believe that their privatisation 
hopes will only be realised by a Tory government. 
  However, two senior ministers have confirmed that the 
Government believes it will need primary legislation. One 
ministerial source said it would be "politically unacceptable" 
to go ahead without seeking the approval of Parliament. 
  Nuclear Electric, which owns and operates reactors in 
England 
and Wales, has been enticing the Government with the prospect 
that it could gain 2 billion pounds from the sale of the company 
in 1996, if it gave an early go-ahead for privatisation. But a 
split has opened in the industry's ranks, with its Scottish 
counterpart being noticeably less "gung-ho" for privatisation. 
  Publication of the terms of reference for a review of the 
nuclear industry, a necessary precursor to privatisation, has 
been delayed for at least four months. Tim Eggar, the Minister 
for Energy, promised the terms for a review of the nuclear 
industry by the end of last year. They were stalled by the 
legal objections to the opening of the Thermal Oxide 
Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) at Windscale in Cumbria. It was 
strongly expected by the industry they would be announced a week 
ago, but the date slipped again. 
  That led to a strong rumour that the review had been 
abandoned. Yesterday, a Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] 
spokesman said: "The review has not been abandoned." 
  In principle, the terms of reference may be announced when 
the Commons resumes next week after the Easter recess, but 
ministers are keen to ensure that starting the review should not 
open the way to a legal challenge to the inauguration of 
Sizewell B. 
  There has been an intense ministerial wrangle over the terms 
of reference, with the DTI insisting on a short internal 
feasibility study before giving the go-ahead for privatisation. 
  Ministerial sources yesterday indicated that the Department 
of the Environment had succeeded in ensuring that the long-term 
environmental impact of nuclear waste would be taken into 
account. The Treasury has also been keen to ensure that the cost 
of decommissioning of nuclear plant in the next century would be 
fully covered if the industry was privatised. 
  The decision to seek primary legislation makes it more 
difficult to meet the timetable of privatisation before the next 
election. The DTI, which is in charge of energy policy, has to 
introduce a gas Bill in the next Queen's Speech to open the 
industry to more competition. It is considering privatising 
parts of the Royal Mail. Opposition sources said it was unlikely 
the DTI would find a third slot in the autumn for a Bill to 
privatise nuclear power. "After that it will be too late, 
because it would be too close to the election," one Labour 
source said. 
  Labour believes that Michael Heseltine, President of the 
Board of Trade, will not allow privatisation to die. "I suspect 
we are getting into Heseltine's leadership manifesto here. He 
still wants to be seen by the right-wing as a radical," the 
source said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany, is banking on Russia to bring 
its influence to bear on the Serbian side to "stop the terrible 
attacks against Gorazde." Otherwise, NATO might be forced to 
carry out further air strikes, the minister said in an interview 
on West German Radio WDR on Monday [11 April]. It is of utmost 
importance for Gorazde as a peace symbol not to fall finally 
into Serbian hands. The special Russian delegate, Vitaliy 
Churkin, was in the region, and he "knows exactly what is at 
stake," Kinkel said. 
  The operation of the two U.S. NATO combat aircraft has been 
fully supported by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. 
Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the SPD Bundestag group, said on 
Saarland Radio that the air strike was a "right step," because 
the United Nations did not have any other opportunity any more. 
Karsten Voigt, foreign-policy spokesman for the SPD Bundestag 
group, confirmed that the air strike was "unfortunately 
inevitable." The Young Social Democrats were of the opposite 
opinion. Heiko Kretschmer, deputy spokesman for the SPD's youth 
organization, described the air strike as proof of NATO's 
failure.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has welcomed 
the NATO air strike against Serbian positions near the east 
Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde. This was an understandable 
step taken by the United Nations, Government Spokesman Dieter 
Vogel stated in Bonn on Monday. The Serbian side had been 
warned but failed to heed the warning. Bonn was hoping that the 
Serbs would now come to reason and that the hostilities could be 
ended quickly. Vogel would not comment on the Russian protests 
against the military action. He said that the Federal 
Government recognized them.

  [Excerpt] Kigali/Cologne -- About 120 Germans who fled 
from the East African country of Rwanda, which is torn apart by 
a civil war, arrived safely in Germany last night. After an 
eight-and-a-half-hour flight, they landed aboard a Bundeswehr 
aircraft at the military section of the Cologne/Bonn airport 10 
minutes after midnight. They were welcomed by relatives and 
friends. The plane also carried 20 Swiss citizens. The 
Bundeswehr airbus took off from the capital of Burundi, 
Bujumbura, yesterday afternoon. The Germans had escaped there 
in convoys. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, German Ambassador Dieter 
Hilscher, his wife, and 11 Germans who are trapped in the relay 
station of Deutsche Welle are still in the Rwandan capital. The 
evacuation was difficult because hostile troops control the 
access roads. However, the Germans are to be evacuated from 
Kigali and gotten to safety as soon as possible. It is still 
unclear whether the German ambassador will remain in Kigali.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to information provided by 
the Foreign Ministry Monday noon [11 April], 11 Germans are 
still stuck in the Deutsche Welle relay station near the Rwandan 
capital Kigali. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Michael Geerdts 
stated that the hostilities were continuing nearby and that the 
access road was mined. At the moment one was examining several 
options to evacuate the trapped Germans, one of which was to 
rescue them by air by helicopter. 
  The Foreign Ministry has thus confuted reports that the 11 
Germans -- seven engineers, three spouses, and one child -- had 
already been flown out of the station by U.S. soldiers. This 
had been said by the director of Deutsche Welle, Dieter Weirich, 
in Cologne earlier today.

  [Text] Bonn -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian 
Democratic Union) welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart Vitaliy 
Radetsky at the Defense Ministry with military honors this 
morning. Radetsky has started a three-day visit of the 
Bundeswehr in Germany. He wants to continue the dialogue on 
security policy that Ruehe initiated with a visit to Ukraine 
last year. At the time, the two ministers signed an agreement 
on military cooperation between the Ukrainian and German Armed 
Forces. 
  Immediately after the welcoming ceremony, the ministers 
began 
their exchange of views on the continuation of the contacts. 
They also discussed the development of a European security 
structure and cooperation between Kiev and NATO. Ukraine 
belongs to the 14 East European countries that have voted in 
favor of close military and political cooperation with the 
Western alliance as a result of the NATO initiative Partnership 
for Peace. In the next few days, Radetsky will also visit 
Bundeswehr units in Nirvenich and Hemer.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Germany and Ukraine intend to extend 
and intensify their military cooperation further. This was 
agreed by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], and his Ukrainian counterpart, Vitaliy 
Radetski in Bonn on Monday [11 April]. They signed a joint 
declaration to this effect: The Bundeswehr and the Ukrainian 
Army intend to cooperate intensively mainly on restructuring the 
armed forces, training of recruits, guiding personnel, and arms 
control. 
  The declaration notes that the "successfully initiated 
cooperation at different levels" should continue. Ruehe started 
the security policy dialogue with Kiev during his visit last 
August. With his Ukrainian guest he discussed the design of the 
European security structure, the hot spots of the world, and 
cooperation between Kiev and NATO. Ukraine is one of the 14 
East European countries that have meanwhile opted for close 
military and political cooperation with the Western alliance in 
connection with NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. 
  In their declaration, the ministers emphasize that "their 
joint objective is the consolidation of peace, stability, and 
security in the Euro-Atlantic area within the framework of the 
all-European process." Both sides concur "that under the 
current conditions creating and maintaining good relations 
between their countries is an essential factor for strengthening 
peace, stability, and security in Europe." Bonn and Kiev 
express their readiness "to contribute to this process through 
intensifying comprehensive relations in the military sphere and 
through making them transparent and predictable." 
  Radetski is due to visit the 31st Fighter Bomber Air Wing 
"Boelcke" at Noervenich, and the 19th Armored Infantry Brigade 
and the 203d Tank Battalion at Hemer.

  [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government has rejected 
allegations by Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin that 
Germany is "indirectly encouraging terrorism" with the 
preliminary stop of weapons supplies. Bonn is prepared to lift 
the delivery stop if these weapons are really used in accordance 
with the NATO rules in Turkey. 
  Cetin's criticism is "not right," government spokesman Vogel 
stated at a news conference in Bonn today. It is clear that the 
government is not biased. The Workers Party of Kurdistan has 
been banned in Germany, and there are efforts to adopt tighter 
rules concerning the deportation of Kurdish rebels. Vogel 
quoted Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who stated in an ARD interview 
that he will not bow to the terror of any group in the streets 
of Germany.

  [Text] In the view of Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
Turkey must be openly reminded to keep human rights -- 
"especially because we have had friendly relations with Turkey 
for decades, because it is our partner in NATO and has an 
important bridging function." In an interview with BILD AM 
SONNTAG, Kinkel said: "Yes, there are human rights violations 
in Turkey." 
  Kinkel once again said that delinquent Kurds should only be 
deported in absolutely exceptional cases. Anyone who commits a 
crime belongs before a court and in prison. The government is 
currently examining whether it is safeguarded that those that 
are deported will not face torture, death penalties, or 
anti-constitutional treatment.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, there 
is "no disagreement" within the government on the deportation of 
violent Kurds to their homeland. The latest differences are 
"unnecessary," Kinkel said before journalists on Monday [11 
April] in connection with criticism of FRG Justice Minister 
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) voiced by Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and the Christian Social Union. Meanwhile, Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) confirmed 
that he wants to conclude an agreement with Turkey immediately 
on the deportation of violent criminals. The talks between the 
two countries have "progressed" on the level of state 
secretaries, Kanther said. 
  Kinkel also stressed that expulsions and deportations are 
legally possible. In the first place, however, Kurdish violent 
criminals are to be brought to trial, sentenced, and serve their 
time in Germany. But every Kurd in the FRG should be aware that 
he will be in danger of being deported if he violates law and 
order. However, according to Kinkel, the prerequisite is a 
"clean" examination of each individual case, which is to be 
dealt with with "extreme caution." 
  "Unfortunately, human rights are still violated in Turkey," 
the foreign minister said. The FRG deduces the right and the 
commitment to call for the observation of human rights precisely 
from its "friendly attitude" toward Turkey and its important 
role as a NATO and economic partner. According to Kinkel, his 
ministry is carefully examining information on the use of arms 
supplied from Germany in Kurdistan. Therefore, the last partial 
delivery of German armament goods was temporarily stopped. The 
Turkish Government is to combat the terrorism initiated by the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, "but with means of the 
rule-of-law state." 
  Interior Minister Kanther commented optimistically on the 
chances of a deportation agreement with Ankara. The interest of 
the two countries in the prevention of extremist actions of 
Kurds is great. Therefore, he also expects Turkey to be 
accommodating as far as promises concerning the possible 
observation of lawsuits and "regulations of access" to the 
deported persons are concerned, Kanther stated. 
  In his opinion, "only few" Kurds to be deported are in 
danger 
in their homeland. Therefore, "with the discussion being 
restricted to capital punishment and torture, one loses sight of 
the iceberg under water," the minister said. Many participants 
in violent acts in Germany are "not threatened as Kurds in 
Turkey, not even by criminal proceedings." More consistent 
action than before has to be taken above all against these 
perpetrators, he said.

  [Text] On Monday [11 April], the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] Presidium -- like party chairman Rudolf 
Scharping previously -- advocated the deportation of Kurdish 
delinquents. However, it can only take place when an examination 
in each individual case has shown that the person to be deported 
neither has to fear torture nor capital punishment in Turkey, 
the party leadership stated. The struggle for the Kurds' 
self-determination has to be carried out with democratic and 
nonviolent means. In particular, the valid German laws have to 
be observed and respected, it was stated. 
  The SPD again criticized the FRG Government because of arms 
supplies from former GDR stocks to Ankara. A government led by 
the SPD will discontinue all deliveries of military material to 
Turkey, it was stated.

  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel considers 
Hungary's and Poland's membership applications to be one of the 
central issues during Germany's European Union [EU] presidency. 
Following Hungary's recent application, Poland was the second of 
the Central and East European countries to apply for membership 
on Friday [8 April]. He will consider himself as advocate of 
these applications since political and economic stability in the 
Central and East European states is "in our very own interest," 
Kinkel said.

  [Text] Munich -- Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany's [SPD] candidate for chancellor will make a 
binding promise to the United States Administration that after 
the Bundestag elections his party will not chose a coalition 
partner that wants to abolish NATO and Bundeswehr. This was 
said by SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen in an interview 
with FOCUS news magazine prior to Scharping's visit to the 
United States. 
  Verheugen said that there will be no partner in Germany for 
the policy adopted by the Greens at their congress in Mannheim. 
Scharping's message to the United States will be: "Germany will 
remain a reliable alliance partner that keeps its obligations."

  [Excerpts] Landshut (DPA) -- In the opinion of the Public 
Prosecutor's Office in Landshut, the controversial statements by 
Franz Schoenhuber, chairman of the extreme-right Republikaner, 
about Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in 
Germany, do not amount to instigation of people. Therefore, 
this authority will not prosecute Schoenhuber ex officio, the 
Public Prosecutor's Office reported on the occasion of the 
conclusion of the preliminary proceedings on Thursday [7 April]. 
A request for the lifting of Schoenhuber's immunity will not be 
submitted to the European Parliament, it was stated. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Public Prosecutor's Office substantiated this by saying 
that Schoenhuber did not instigate people because he did not 
turn against an entire population group. The remarks were "only 
directed against Mr. Bubis and Mr. Friedman in particular," the 
chairman of the Jewish community in Frankfurt/Main. This cannot 
be generally regarded "as a statement about the Jews living in 
Germany."

  [Excerpts] Cologne/Munich/Bonn (DPA) -- Voices calling for 
a ban of the right-wing extremist Republikaner or at least their 
classification as a right-wing extremist party are multiplying. 
In addition to Michael Friedman, member of the Presidium of the 
Central Council of Jews in Germany, who advocated a ban of the 
Republikaner in the Cologne newspaper EXPRESS, Deputy Social 
Democratic Party of Germany Chairwoman Herta Daeubler-Gmelin 
demanded, on Western German Radio on Friday [8 April], that the 
Republikaner be declared a right-wing extremist party. 
  In the meantime, Bavarian Justice Minister Hermann Leeb 
(Christian Social Union) has supported the decision by the 
Landshut public prosecutor's office not to initiate 
investigations against Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber 
for instigating people. [passage omitted] Leeb rejected 
criticism of the public prosecutor's office as unjustified. In 
assessing facts the office cannot orient itself toward political 
demands or statements, he stressed. 
  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] member Friedman said, 
regarding the findings by the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for 
the protection of the Constitution about acts of violence 
committed by Republikaner: "I think that Republikaner 
functionaries are people who commit verbal acts of violence, 
indirectly increase xenophobic prejudices, and thus provoke 
violence. Political functionaries and their groups, which stand 
outside the Basic Law with their statements, must be banned." 
  Speaking to the press in Bonn on Friday, a spokesman for the 
FRG Interior Ministry did not want to comment on the status of 
the party in the current Constitutional Protection Report. He 
pointed to the presentation of the report planned for next week. 
In the Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag the CDU group wants to 
discuss the controversy over Schoenhuber in a topical debate 
entitled "Anti-Semitism as Schoenhuber's Political Strategy."

  [Excerpt] Hamburg -- In connection with the debate on 
banning the right-wing extremist Republikaner, Hesse's 
Minister-President Hans Eichel (Social Democratic Party) has 
accused Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union) of "making the Republikaner acceptable." 
Unless Kanther lists the Republikaner as right-wing extremist 
party in the next Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
report, he will work directly into the hands of the enemies of 
democracy, Eichel said in Wiesbaden on Friday [8 April]. In 
Eichel's view, there is sufficient evidence of Republikaner 
members participating in violent acts against foreigners.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government will introduce 
the 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge as of 1 January 1995 
without limiting it to a specific period. This was affirmed by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an interview with ARD television on 
Friday evening [8 April]. He does "not" see "any chance" for 
limitation. He stressed that, apart from the solidarity 
surcharge, there will not be any further increases in general 
taxes next year. At the same time, however, Kohl implied 
additional burdens in the sphere of traffic policy. The 
ecologically sensible traffic development, which has been 
introduced with the railroad reform, will cost more money. 
  The chancellor accused the Social Democrats of not having 
any 
practicable ideas in economic and tax policy. "It is the old 
socialist ideas that are now being dragged out again." A 
red-green [Social Democrats-Greens] coalition would destroy the 
incipient economic upswing through more bureaucracy, punishment 
of achievement, and social envy, Kohl said. He expressed the 
conviction that the Free Democratic Party of Germany will 
clearly exceed the 5 percent threshold at the elections in 
October and will continue the coalition with the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. "I am 
quite sure that we will win the Bundestag elections." All 
indicators, in particular in the economy, are pointing to that. 
  Kohl warned the CDU/CSU against leaving the political 
center. 
"I am not at all against winning as many votes as possible from 
right of center and as many votes as possible from left of 
center. However, the status of our party and the basic movement 
of history, of tradition, and also of the program is in the 
center, and we have no intention of letting anyone else to 
occupy this place."

  [Text] Osnabrueck (DPA) -- In connection with the 
financing of the Eurofighter 2000, the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] has made serious accusations against Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union). In an 
interview with NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Friday edition), SPD 
defense expert Walter Kolbow said that the ministry has 
confirmed reports that the thrift version of the Eurofighter, 
which Ruehe pushed through, gives rise to considerable 
additional costs for development because of the necessary 
changes. The SPD will demand clarification of the matter at a 
Defense Committee meeting next Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Deutschlandfunk radio reported that the German share alone 
in 
the costs of the four-nation project will rise by at least 300 
million German marks [DM]. An expert report by the Federal 
Audit Office even gave the additional costs as DM700 million. 
Kolbow stressed that the combat plane will force Ruehe "to give 
a political and financial oath of disclosure." The minister 
must be aware of the fact that the Bundestag will not approve 
one pfennig more than planned for the development of the 
Eurofighter. Even disregarding the now mentioned additional 
costs, Ruehe does not know how to pay for the plane's 
development.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Apparently, there is now a clear 
upward tendency in the west German economy after all. It is, 
above all, stimulated by foreign demand. As compared to the 
previous month, in February the industry in the old FRG, with 
price and seasonal adjustments, had a 3.1-percent increase in 
orders. As the FRG Economics Ministry reported on Thursday [7 
April], orders from abroad increased by 3.8 percent and domestic 
orders by 2.7 percent. As compared to February 1993, total 
orders received increased by 3.2 percent. 
  As compared to December, the January result of west German 
industry has meanwhile been corrected from an increase by 1.8 
percent to 0.8 percent. In February, with an increase of 3.8 
percent as compared to the previous month, the capital goods 
sector, which is important for the economy, reported the 
greatest increase in demand, which even increased by 9 percent 
in the sector of cars and other road vehicles. 
  In the two months' comparison between January/February and 
November/December of last year, the processing trade received 
altogether 1.5 percent more orders. As compared to January and 
February 1993, it was approximately 2.3 percent more, with 
foreign countries accounting for a 9-percent increase and 
domestic orders decreasing by 1.3 percent. As compared to the 
two previous months of November and December, domestic orders 
were still stagnating, while foreign orders increased by 3.5 
percent. Orders for basic materials and producer goods 
increased by about 3.5 percent and for consumer goods by about 3 
percent. The industry producing capital goods had to put up 
with a slight decrease by 0.5 percent. As compared to the two 
previous months, the changes are as follows (in percent):

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PLO Spokesman Praises Italy, Denies </F>
Rumor"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 8 -- Italy was praised today for 
the role the nation has played in the Mideast peace process in a 
statement made by Nimr Hammad, the Palestinian general delegate 
in Rome, who said rumors that Italians tapped for the observers 
force in Hebron would be replaced by Spaniards were "absolutely 
false." 
  Hammad told the Italian news agency ANSA that these rumors 
"do not favor the peace process and the presence of observers in 
Hebron" on talk picked up by the press according to which 
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat was 
preparing to ask Spain to send observers in Italy's place 
because of political uncertainties in Rome. 
  This version of events originated Wednesday [6 April] in 
Cairo where consultations had been started up on the Hebron 
force of 160 lightly-armed Norwegian, Danish and Italian 
observers. 
  The head of the PLO office here said that Italy is 
well-liked 
by Palestinians because over the years, since 1975, this nation 
has extended its good offices to allow Israelis and Palestinians 
to meet. "Unlike other countries, Italy never made propaganda 
out of its activities within the peace process (and) in effect, 
provided great help. 
  ``Since the beginning, since 1975, Italy has hosted many 
secret meetings between Palestinians and Israelis. Various 
ministers, in the present government as well, like Peres' 
deputy, Yossi Beilin, have had their first contacts with PLO 
officials in Rome or Milan,'' said Hammad with reference to 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  The PLO delegate also said that Italy contributes 
substantial 
financing for the Israeli-occupied territories and for 
assistance for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and spoke of what 
he said was the "virginity" or pristine nature of Italian 
cooperation in Palestine where "everything is regular and 
everything goes well." 
  These factors, he added, have created a climate of 
"affection" for Italians. "In the territories, just say you are 
Italian and you immediately feel the warmth of the people. Like 
in Lebanon, moreover, where the Italian presence is highly 
appreciated, you feel that the people's reaction to Italians is 
positive." 
  On the international force to send to Hebron, Hammad said 
discussions were under way on expanding the number and that it 
is not now possible to name a date for the deployment of these 
observers because there are numerous problems still open between 
the PLO and Israel. One of these problems is the presence of 
Jewish settlers. 
  "Their presence, with the ongoing presence of the Israeli 
Army, would cause great tension, making the work of the 
observers difficult," he added. 
  Last night, it was learned here that members of the 
three-nation observer force to oversee peace in Hebron may visit 
that city next week to lay the groundwork for their mission 
there. The three working groups set up to prepare the mission, 
which will involve 35 Italian, 35 Danish and 90 Norwegian 
observers, were scheduled to gather separately today in Rome, 
Tel Aviv and Cairo. They will then get together next week for a 
reconnaissance trip to Hebron, sources said. 
  The observers force, dubbed Temporary International Presence 
in Hebron (TIPH), was requested by Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation March 31, after the Hebron mosque 
massacre carried out by a Jewish extremist February 25. It will 
mark the first time that armed foreign observers have been 
allowed into the Israeli-occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Franco Venturini commentary: "The Strength of the Weak"] </F>
  [Text] The bombs dropped by U.S. NATO aircraft against the 
Serbs laying siege to Gorazde broke the magic spell. For some 
weeks now, Bosnia was no longer making the headlines, Sarajevo 
no longer featured in TV news programs, and, following so many 
horrors broadcast live, the media's silence authorized us to 
believe that the peacemaking process was by now under way in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  True, for the past two months the snipers in the hills have 
no longer used Sarajevo's women and children for target 
practice. The threat of intervention was enough to force the 
Serbs to move back their outposts. Restoring the NATO deterrent 
was enough to enable Russian diplomacy to do its share, thus 
giving rise to a genuine hope of peace. 
  We must volley the ball, Western governments and the United 
Nations immediately told themselves, we must everywhere apply 
the formula which worked so well in Sarajevo, we must preempt 
the unavoidable resumption of hostilities. 
  What happened, instead? What happened was that, while the 
Americans' and Russians' bipolar diplomacy got bogged down in 
the complicated setting up of federations and confederations -- 
without thereby effectively involving the Serbs, and without 
solving the key problem of the territory's division -- the 
United Nations did not succeed in mustering, worldwide, the 
10,000 blue helmets requested by general Rose (though, in fact, 
many more were actually needed) to pull apart the opposing 
forces immediately and ensure the surveillance of the worst 
hotspots. 
  Italy was never asked to contribute to this effort, and this 
was a lucky break, considering the political climate in which 
such a difficult decision would have had to be made. However, a 
much weightier factor than our absence, or than others' 
half-heartedness, was the confirmation of the United States' 
unwillingness to commit land forces in Bosnia unless agreements 
had already been subscribed to and guaranteed by the parties 
involved. Which is tantamount to saying never. 
  Washington's unspoken message (which was rendered 
unavoidable 
by the opinion polls, and by President Clinton's volatile 
relationship with Congress) must have played a part in 
relighting the fuse and unwittingly convincing the Serbs, and 
perhaps also the Muslims, that the use of arms was still a 
viable option -- that they could start again, perhaps setting 
out from the Gorazde enclave. 
  This is a major provocation, given that a year ago Gorazde 
was specifically declared a "safety area" by the UN Security 
Council. Therefore, the massacre which has been going on now for 
days, and the imminent fall of the town overcrowded with 
refugees, have convinced Butrus-Ghali, and then NATO, to launch 
the first limited allied attack against Serbian land positions 
since the four Serbian pirate aircraft were shot down. 
  This irreproachable decision, which might have been rendered 
unnecessary if, over the past few weeks, the West had resolutely 
jumped the peace train, is now again giving rise to all sorts of 
questions: Will the anti-Serb deterrent work this time too? 
How will the Russians react? Will it be possible to resume 
negotiations? 
  Above all: Is there a real chance of peace unless America 
makes use of her armed credibility also in the field? A sad 
question, this latter one, for Europeans.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Country's Catholic Bishops </F>
Back New Government"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, April 11 -- Rwandan Catholic 
bishops have thrown their support behind the new Kigali 
government and called on the nation's catholics, 44 percent of 
Rwanda's total population, to help the new leadership. The 
country's four bishops were to have taken part in the African 
Synod which has opened here. 
  In a statement released here by the Vatican press office, 
Rwanda's bishops praised the armed forces for how they were able 
to restore security and called on the authorities to "continue 
to protect all, regardless of ethnic origin, party or region" 
and to "neutralize those who block peace." 
  The bishops went on to strongly condemn those who initiated 
the civil strife between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes, sparked by 
the death of that nation's president, shot down in a plane 
together with the president of neighboring Burundi. 
  In particular, the Rwanda bishops struck out against the 
"spirit of vengeance" and the looting, massacres of innocent 
civilians and religious workers "which has even taken place 
inside churches... which is unprecedented." 
  The statement also underscored how the new government had 
pledged a "return to peace and security, a fight against hunger 
and negotiations with the Rwanda Patriotic Front." 
  "The Catholic Bishops of Rwanda" the statement to the press 
read, "favor dialogue and sincere and efficient negotiations. 
It is for this reason that they call on the government and the 
Rwanda Patriotic Front to avoid the logic of war to resolve 
their conflicts." 
  "They call on all Rwandans, and Christians in particular" 
the 
noted continued, "to show themselves to be the makers of peace, 
protecting, in particular, those seeking refuge and giving aid 
to the needy." 
  The Rwandan church officials added how they had been shocked 
by the murders of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi and for 
the successive bloodshed. "In these difficult and critical 
times" the statement concluded, "each and all must avoid 
reacting under the influence of rage."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Senator Francesco </F>
Speroni by Gianfranco Ballardin; place and date not given: 
"Speroni: Silvio Must Not Consider Himself the Only Leader"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Ballardin] Is it true, 
Mr. Speroni, that your demand to have a League prime minister is 
only a preliminary tactic? 
  [Speroni] There is also a tactical element, but the essence 
of the matter is the following: [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi cannot claim to be the only leader in the coalition, 
overshadowing [League Secretary] Bossi. We have reminded him 
that the League is the number-one political force, at least in 
the lower house. 
  [Ballardin] Therefore, we are only at the preliminary 
tactical stage: You are raising your voice on the prime 
minister issue so as to make your partners swallow the 
federalist hot potato. 
  [Speroni] Let me speak very frankly: Between the issue of 
the prime minister and that of federalism, I think it is more 
important to break through on the latter. We suggested to 
Berlusconi creating a governmental committee which would prepare 
a constitutional reform -- in a federalist direction -- within a 
two-month period. Then the government would approve it, and 
would submit a constitutional bill, which would have to be 
approved after a double reading in the two houses. 
  [Ballardin] In brief, what competences would the central 
state have? 
  [Speroni] Defense, foreign policy, monetary policy, and, 
partly, justice. Berlusconi listened to us and promised to 
reply by next Wednesday [13 April], after having consulted 
[National Alliance leader] Fini, who is continuing to send out 
contradictory messages: One day he is open to federalism, and 
next day he is against. 
  [Ballardin] Fini is saying that he does not want to 
jeopardize national unity. 
  [Speroni] We are not aware that in the United States, 
Switzerland, or Germany federalism has given rise to this sort 
of risk. 
  [Ballardin] Let us consider now the senior institutional 
positions, in the upper and lower houses. For the Senate, 
[former President] Cossiga is being mentioned. 
  [Speroni] Is Cossiga a League member? No. Is he a Forza 
Italia member? No. Is he a National Alliance [AN] member? No. 
Not only has he not won the elections, he also represents the 
old regime, having joined the government 20 years ago, under the 
DC [Christian Democratic Party] banner. As you know, I am 
standing as a candidate for the post of Senate speaker. 
  [Ballardin] What about [Italian Republican Party (PRI) 
member] Spadolini? 
  [Speroni] It cannot be that I win, and then find someone 
like 
Spadolini as the Senate speaker, just like before. Therefore, 
Spadolini must go home. 
  [Ballardin] [Center Union member] Biondi for the lower 
house? 
  [Speroni] Biondi is part of the winning coalition, but he is 
certainly not a new face. Still, he may pass. 
  [Ballardin] What about the anti-Mafia commission? What about 
the services control committee? 
  [Speroni] The same applies. Enough with people like 
[Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Senator] Violante and 
Pecchioli [PDS member, chairman of the parliamentary secret 
services committee]! For the senior administrative positions, 
as well as for those in the state partnerships, we must partly 
introduce the "spoil system" in our own country. In the United 
States, when a new president takes office, over 10,000 civil 
servants, appointed by the previous administration, get fired. 
  [Ballardin] What about the minister sweepstake? We have not 
yet discussed any ministers' names, except two cases, [Clean 
Hands public prosecutor] Di Pietro and [former Clean Hands 
judge] Parenti. In Di Pietro's case we decided "no." As far as 
Parenti is concerned, she will not have the justice portfolio. 
  [Ballardin] What about [Radical leader] Pannella as foreign 
minister? 
  [Speroni] We have not discussed this possibility. 
  [Ballardin] What about [President] Scalfaro? 
  [Speroni] Someone who has been president during the First 
Republic cannot be president in the second, unless he is himself 
the ferryman. 
  [Ballardin] However, Berlusconi said that Scalfaro could 
retain his position, because he managed to stay "above the 
contending parts." 
  [Speroni] We do not agree. Scalfaro is a conservative, and 
if everything changes, as we want it to change, he is the first 
who must leave. Perhaps not from one day to the next, among 
other reasons because the present Constitution does not provide 
for this situation, unless something new comes up on the [former 
Sisde chief] Broccoletti and company front. We hope that he 
will be sensible enough to leave of his own accord.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio </F>
Berlusconi by Vittorio Zucconi in Arcore; date not given: "How 
I Want To Govern Italy"] 
  [Excerpt] Arcore -- [Passage omitted] Who made you do this, 
Doctor Berlusconi? What demons forced you to leave your villa 
in Arcore and enter the fray with [Northern League Secretary] 
Bossi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, [Democratic Party of the 
Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto, and [Pact for Italy leader] 
Segni? "Love for my country. I realized as far back as last 
summer that I had to decide, when the new electoral law handing 
Italy over to the politicians of the Left was passed, a Left 
which pretends to be liberal but which carries within the 
inextirpable kernel of economic planning and statism. The 
center was in pieces, the Right was in tatters, I attempted in 
vain to convince them to come to an agreement, to form a team. 
I picked up their forces, and within three months I had created 
a party from zero, and put together 400 candidates; I organized 
the electoral campaign and I said to myself: My life as an 
entrepreneur, as an industrialist, is finished. One phase of my 
existence has come to an end, and another one is beginning, that 
of politics. I am ready to sell my shares, if buyers can be 
found in this difficult market, providing that the work and 
faithfulness of those who have followed me is rewarded." Sell 
everything, really sell? "I am ready to go even beyond American 
standards. My life as an entrepreneur is coming to an end. I am 
in the political world. I have overcome the first hurdle, and 
there is still a lot to do. I also want to convince everyone 
who said that I was mad." 
  Away from the rows of factories, condominiums, sham country 
cottages, and motorway turn-offs, from Berlusconi's villa the 
Alps appear extremely close and the dust of politics a very long 
way off. But it is only a mirage, because the bites of Bossi, 
whom he calls ("do not write it," but I do write it, be patient, 
it is too beautiful) "dangerous and unpredictable as a wounded 
boar," are strong. And the shadow of those young people's 
fascist salutes following the victory weigh on him. "I know, 
certain gestures and Fini's praises of Mussolini as a statesman 
have made a bad impression, in particular abroad, and I am aware 
that there is a lot of work to do. But a general has to make 
war with the troops which he has, and I have no doubts about 
Fini. His liberal choices are clear and have been made, his 
path toward liberalism and freedom has been a genuine path. And 
I am ready to guarantee this, I who am balance, moderation, and 
measure personified. There is no, and I say, no getting away 
from this choice of balance and moderation. This should be 
clear, also abroad." 
  But, on the other hand, it is not clear indeed where the 
promise of a stable, strong government, double quick, is going 
to end, now that relationships between yesterday's allies have 
become those between the hunter and the wounded boar. "Bossi 
will do what he wants. Outside the alliance with me and Fini 
there is nothing for him, and he knows it. He certainly knew it 
a short time ago when, at the house of my friend [Fininvest 
chairman] Fedele Confalonieri we lifted our champagne glasses 
together to toast the new government program. I am speaking 
clearly: If I am given the task, I will form the government. 
If it is not a majority, we will vote again, and we will count 
the votes...." Whose votes, and with whom? "For example, with 
the votes of the moderate Catholics, now that the Church has 
recognized my center role." And why should not the other 
parties attempt to form a different majority? "Oh yes," he 
adds, quickly stifling a yawn, "a nice government of Bossi, [PDS 
Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, [former Italian Popular Party (PPI)] 
Secretary Martinazzoli, [Rete leader] Orlando, and [Communist 
Renewal leader] Bertinotti? They come to an agreement. One 
could blow it over like a house of cards." 
  Maybe, but Silvio Berlusconi is not a laughing man, rather 
he 
is a man who smiles, with his now famous, voted for, telegenic 
smile ("let us not begin with the story of TV in the electoral 
campaign in which I had just 6 percent of presence on the TV 
screens in March, less than Bossi; so what else?"), a smile 
which perhaps was once the salesman's smile, but which has now 
become his own. It now seems obvious that the Vendor and the 
True Person have merged, as if Berlusconi has finally convinced 
himself that he is what he says he is. And Berlusconi is not 
someone to be ashamed of his success "which I have earned, 
worked hard for, like [Milan soccer star] Baresi who made his 
billions playing the great defender. And why not?" 
  If he does not smile, if he does not succeed in giving me 
the 
impression of a really happy man, at peace with himself, the 
reasons do not lie in money, Fininvest accounts, or the quarrels 
with Bossi. The secret lies in a championship which Berlusconi 
feels that he has not yet won, making the victories so far only 
partial victories: the superbowl of respect. When I ask him, a 
bit louder, in order to be heard above the buzz of the motor 
movers manicuring his lawns outside, if he, the most recent 
arrival at the table of power, still feels that he is treated as 
a "parvenu," I realize that I have struck to the heart of a man 
who has had enough of the teasing, of the commonplaces, of "Mr. 
TV," "Berlusca," "Arcore man," and "His Broadcasting Highness," 
which rain down on him. 
  It is as if a stopper had burst open. "It is a whole life 
which is involved. When I entered soccer, you know the results. 
I took a team on the edge of bankruptcy and carried them to 
three, touch wood, four championships and two champions' cups. 
When I wanted to make and sell houses which were different, 
properties which were different with gardens, footpaths, 
12-meter trees, and cycle tracks, people already began to laugh. 
I took in hand televisions belonging to private groups which 
were losing billions hand over fist, and everyone laughed 
because they believed that they had had the better of me, that 
they had hoodwinked the parvenu. I wanted to enter politics, 
and everyone said to me, including my dearest friends, even my 
family, but no, you are crazy, but you are going to your ruin, 
and ruin there would certainly have been, also for my industrial 
group, if I had lost. But I did not lose. Let them laugh." 
  Some 50 years striving for recognition, the liberation of 
this incubus: the parvenu. On a shelf, under a stupendous 18th 
century picture, I see a souvenir which reminds me of the first 
dollar which American billionaires used to frame, but it is not 
money. It is a little yellowed press clipping enclosed in 
Plexiglas, a two-column headline dating from 1961 announcing the 
award of the "Gioannino Manzoni" Advertising Award in an amount 
of 500,000 lire to Berlusconi Silvio. The first clipping of 
public respect. "I always had all of them against me, even in 
this election campaign. The newspapers were against me, 
Scalfari [LA REPUBBLICA editor], LA REPUBBLICA, and L'ESPRESSO, 
because they belong to another party. Mieli at the CORRIERE and 
Mauro at LA STAMPA because of their convictions and that of 
their editors. Montanelli has left IL GIORNALE without my ever 
saying anything to him, only a lunch-time phrase about Segni, 
who seemed to me destined to lose. He has gone his way because 
someone enamored of his own image as he was could not bear to 
cohabit with someone who was beating him precisely in the area 
of image. The same applies to Bossi. The big industrialists 
did not move a finger to help me. I ran alone." 
  We walked together down the gravel paths of the park, past 
the immense sculpture of Cascella, as far as the family tomb, 
excavated in the basement, to host friends, himself, but in 
particular his father, who died four years ago. "A certain 
journalist teased me about this tomb. But do you know why I 
built it? Because my father, before I died, said to me: 
`Silvio, put me in your park, and when you go running in the 
morning, stop for a moment and say to me: Goodbye, Dad.' Let us 
move on," and he pushed me outside, toward the green soccer 
fields where someone had placed the ball on the penalty kick-off 
disk, ready to be kicked surely into the goal net. "You are not 
cold?" he asked solicitously. "No, I have a question. With so 
much rage in your body, Doctor Berlusconi, do you have a wish 
for vendettas? Against the RAI [Italian State Broadcasting 
Corporation], against the newspapers, against everyone. 
  ``What are you saying? But I am incapable of vendettas, I am 
also incapable of taking it out against those who trip me up 
within my own companies, who betray me at home, no vendetta, 
never, against nobody. I would like to take the responsibility 
of governing in order to give my country a hand, not in order to 
punish anyone. This image of Berlusconi-Nero is ridiculous." 
  How many promises, how many easy hopes flew up into the blue 
sky of Brianza, and how easy it is to talk. "I have never 
spoken senselessly in my life, and my life itself demonstrates 
this. In the first 100 days of my government, if I am given 
responsibility for it, it will be necessary to give a hand to 
those who take risks, who invest, who create work. We need to 
work quickly to get the economy going again, very quickly. We 
need to reward, not to punish with taxation as the statist 
Socialists want to. And when we have public expenditure under 
control, we can also look at fairer taxation for those who can 
do less." One hundred days in the American fashion, in the 
Reagan fashion, in the Thatcher fashion, the models spew out. 
"Not models, but people I admire, and not that Ross Perot whom 
some have compared me with mistakenly. I am not a John Wayne in 
politics. I would certainly like to have Thatcher's success, 
but not have the country pay the social costs of these 
successes." 
  This then is the old "Italian dream," having one's cake and 
eating it. But it is not dreams, but income policies which have 
ruled our social peace until now. "You would like to ask me 
whether I will have done, as prime minister, with the income 
policy, with the agreements between CONFINDUSTRIA [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry], the government, and the 
trade unions. Martino, my main economic adviser, is a free 
trader of the Friedman school, he believes in the principle of 
competition, but he does not preach everyone fighting everyone 
else. Agreements are necessary. The problem is not to turn 
them into a straitjacket which imprisons development, the 
market, and employment itself, in particular of young people, 
which we wish to defend. I repeat, agreements with trade unions 
are necessary, providing they do not transform themselves into a 
barrier against the unemployed person seeking his first job." 
  Everything seems so easy, so logical, when one walks besides 
a persuasive man such as Berlusconi in his park, and the desire 
to "buy" is very strong. And for the same reason it is very 
easy not to believe, just as one does not believe in the 
promises of Carosello [TV advertising] promising to strengthen 
hair with lotion. On 28 March, Italy, ripped off by the First 
Republic, bought the Berlusconi lotion. Now we will see whether 
the hair grows better.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F>
Fini by "G.D. Ro."; place and date not given: "It Was the 
League Which Knocked on Our Door"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Following a 
"long-range war" made up of rather scathing statements, you have 
finally met eye to eye. Deputy Fini, how did you find the 
Senator [League Secretary Bossi]? 
  [Fini] I know him. In some respects, Bossi is even quite 
amiable. But, on the other hand, he is also unpredictable. 
After a few moments of friendliness, he begins to attack, to 
overturn... everything that can be overturned. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] How did you feel? 
  [Fini] I have a very peculiar character. I am a cool-minded 
person. I did no let him overpower me in any way, I am used to 
political battles. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Did you expect this kind of move from 
Bossi -- coming like this, suddenly, to speak with you? Was it 
the League that knocked at your door? 
  [Fini] Last Tuesday afternoon [5 April], [League lower house 
floor leader] Maroni turned up at our group's office in the 
Chamber of Deputies. He met [National Alliance lower house 
floor leader] Tatarella. I learned this later, when I spoke on 
the phone to Luigi Rossi. No, frankly, I did not expect them to 
approach us. I was pleasantly surprised, among other things 
because apparently they have forgotten the consultations they 
were supposed to have with the center and the Left. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] What do you think of this thaw? 
  [Fini] I am glad. I had advocated this repeatedly: Let us 
stop just asserting our respective principles. How can we give 
birth to a new system if we go on like this? 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] You are accepting federalism. Is this 
not out of keeping with your tradition? 
  [Fini] Federalism, in theory, is neither good nor bad. The 
essential thing is to ensure national unity is not endangered. 
American and German federalism are built upon a strong national 
sense, which is never called into question. However, things are 
different in Italy. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is this why you want presidentialism 
as 
a counterweight? 
  [Fini] Of course. There are several forms of 
presidentialism, a high form which provides for the president of 
the republic's direct election; another form based on the people 
electing the prime minister. We must find constitutional 
solutions enabling a synthesis. This, however, is a task for 
the constitutional experts. I might say something misleading. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] If you do not mind my asking again: 
How could you convert to federalism? 
  [Fini] Let me stress that, even in our platform, we did not 
rule anything out a priori. We asked for an efficient state, 
safeguarding national unity. It is now up to constitutional 
engineers, working at a negotiating table, to find the right 
solutions. No agreement has yet been reached. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Perhaps you and the League shared a 
common interest, namely that of not allowing Berlusconi's 
personality to overshadow you? 
  [Fini] I am only interested in one thing: enabling a 
coalition government to be formed -- and coalition governments 
are effectively established when the political parties involved 
are on an equal footing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "National Alliance, League Reach </F>
Outline Agreement on Federalism"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 8 -- Representatives of the 
federalist Northern League and neo-fascist National Alliance 
reached outline agreement on a formula "reconciling a 
presidential republic with federalism" in a meeting Friday [8 
April], party officials said. 
  "We agreed," said the League's Lower House whip Roberto 
Maroni, "that this would be a government of complete change, 
which will initiate very strong and incisive reform, rewriting 
the constitution to reconcile federalism and a presidential 
republic." 
  This was the second day of contacts between the League and 
National Alliance, which, with Forza Italia and several smaller 
parties, were part of the right-wing Freedom Front which scored 
a victory in last month's general elections. The Freedom Front 
parties are now seeking consensus on programmes to allow them to 
form a government. 
  National Alliance and the League said they would be working 
on a scheme including direct elections of the prime minister, 
and reorganisation of the state along federal lines, leading to 
constitutional reforms which would then be put to the public in 
a referendum. 
  Domenico Fisichella, of National Alliance which sticks 
firmly 
to its line of the indivisibility of the state, said after 
today's meeting that "federalism has tended, throughout history, 
to unite peoples, and not to break them apart. The 
counter-balance of a presidential republic is necessary, 
however." 
  "There are two possibilities as far as a presidential 
republic goes," Fisichella added. "There is the direct election 
of the president of the republic, and the direct election of the 
premier. This second option is the most practical," and will 
provide the basis for further League-National Alliance talks, he 
said. 
  Gianfranco Miglio, the League's ideologue, briefed 
journalists on his long-term view of Italian institutions, 
stressing that these ideas were not discussed in today's talks: 
"With the direct election of the prime minister," he said, "the 
president would lose many of his current functions... He would 
be reduced to president of the constitutional court." 
  Miglio foresaw an end to the cabinet, which would be 
replaced 
by a `directorate' of representatives from the cantons into 
which the country would be divided. 
  Miglio's League colleagues foresaw a six-month timetable for 
basic constitutional changes, which would be drawn up by the 
executive, then presented to parliament for its opinion before 
being put before the country in a referendum. 
  "The era of parties running things together has come to an 
end, and the governing majority will therefore make its proposal 
which will then be debated in its natural place, in parliament," 
said the League's Senate whip Francesco Speroni. 
  "If the initiative comes from the government," said Roberto 
Maroni, "then there will be none of the long-windedness which 
accompanied the bi-cameral reform committee (which overhauled 
electoral laws) and it will not take long to draw up a proposal 
to put before the Houses." 
  With Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi having withdrawn 
from the government-formation fray after his most recent verbal 
battle with League chief Umberto Bossi, haggling over government 
posts was apparently absent from today's talks. 
  Some mention of who will fill the premier's office was made, 
it would seem: "It is up to the president of the republic to 
decide on who will get a prime ministerial mandate," said 
Giuseppe Tatarella of National Alliance, who was present for the 
gathering, "but all signs are pointing towards Berlusconi, in 
his capacity as leader of the force which came first in Italy." 
  And Forza Italia's chief financial expert, Antonio Martino, 
looked confident about his party's future role in forging 
economic policy. Commenting on 1994 forecasts presented by the 
cabinet today, the economics professor said "there can be no 
doubt that if our proposals are adopted, the growth in 
employment and in investments, and the development rate would be 
far above that predicted by the government." Forza Italia will 
be back in the picture next Monday when Freedom Front allies get 
together. 
  "This will be the first meeting in which all the parties 
which consider themselves government allies will discuss 
programmes," said Giuseppe Tatarella. "And from Monday on, we 
will all be looking forward to decisions from President (Oscar 
Luigi) Scalfaro."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Madness' To Scrap 3-Way </F>
Bargaining, Modigliani Warns"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Venice, April 9 -- The possibility of Italy's 
new right-wing government doing away with Italy's traditional 
three-way wage bargaining between the government, unions and 
employers was today described as "madness" by Nobel 
Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani. 
  "The one madness of the new government would be eliminating 
the three-way table with unions and employers. Only with joint 
bargaining would it be possible to plan a further drop in 
inflation and guarantee real wages via exchange-rate policy," 
Modigliani said on the sidelines of a conference here. 
  After noting that the pledge of media magnate turned 
politician Silvio Berlusconi to create a million jobs in the 
next two years is "conceivable, but extremely unlikely," 
Modigliani said that a separate Italian policy aimed at boosting 
employment was "unthinkable unless the whole of Europe moves to 
bring down interest rates." 
  "One of the causes of Italy's present crisis," he explained, 
"is the 1970's incomes policy, with its logic of wages as an 
independent variable compared to prices. This drove wages above 
the country's productivity levels, spelling an increase in 
inflation and the net result that Italy's international 
competitiveness fell. 
  "But now even the trade unions have realised there is 
nothing 
to be gained from hiking wages. The three-way table allows the 
`internationalisation' of problems, so that the overall effects 
of demands are seen. This must be pursued." 
  Modigliani said he was not in a position to judge the 
economic programme of Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, shaped 
by monetarist Antonio Martino, "until they say what spending 
cuts they are going to make after they've cut taxes." But he 
stressed that "it will be fundamental to generate an increase in 
domestic demand, while waiting for Europe to wake up." 
  He "did not know" why the government's economic report 
(released yesterday) revised growth down from 1.6 to 1.3 percent 
this year. "I am more optimistic, and am hoping for 2 percent, 
because all the conditions for a small recovery are there. But 
I don't think a real growth dynamic will start up if the 
continent as a whole does not move." 
  Modigliani put pension reform high on the next government's 
priority list. "You need to change the concept of welfare 
state: you shouldn't promise a pension proportionate to what was 
received during one's working years, but instead guarantee a 
vital minimum for all. The rest should be left to voluntary 
fund payments by the individual." 
  On privatisations, he expressed full confidence that "the 
entire process was followed with the selfsame care." "I know 
the Treasury experts who dealed with the procedures: there was 
nothing murky going on. Of course, it was impossible to sell at 
a higher price than the one set, otherwise you wouldn't have had 
any buyers."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Gianfranco Ballardin in Rome; date not given: "The 
Knight's Words Do Not Annoy Fini -- `We Do Not Want a Right-Wing 
Government Either'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Ballardin] Deputy Fini, the Knight [Forza 
Italia leader Berlusconi nickname] has "very forcefully" made it 
clear that his alliance with you is not a right-wing alliance, 
and he pledged himself to "keep the tiller constantly in the 
center." Do you agree with the new government's centrist 
positioning? 
  [Fini] During the electoral campaign, Berlusconi endlessly 
repeated that Forza Italia is not a right-wing movement, but a 
center one. On the other hand, National Alliance [AN] is most 
certainly a right-wing force, a very variegated right, with a 
thousand different shades and contents. If a government is 
formed, it will be a center-right government. But these are 
just labels. 
  [Ballardin] The Knight added: "AN comes from the Right, but 
it has resolutely asserted its liberal stand. We will judge 
from their performance whether this resolve is born out by the 
facts." 
  [Fini] There is no reason whatever why the Right should not 
be liberal. All this, however, is only wordplay. The 
government must be characterized exclusively by its platform. 
  [Ballardin] In Pontida [League rally venue], [League 
Secretary] Bossi said: "We are antifascist, and we will not 
tolerate any resurrection of that ideology. Let Fini and AN be 
aware of this." 
  [Fini] Bossi will somehow have to explain to the League's 
supporters why, after having proclaimed "Never with AN" 
throughout the electoral campaign, he is now forming a 
government with us. My reply is that there will be no 
resurrection, because AN is certainly not a fascist or 
neofascist formation. I now hope Bossi will contribute to 
turning 25 April [Liberation Day] into a national appeasement 
date, rather than one of hate. 
  [Ballardin] Yesterday Bossi was very moderate. 
  [Fini] Yes, I believe that by now he has not only fully 
accepted joining the government, as he made the League 
supporters who were present pledge themselves to do, but also 
that he has understood that certain typically rally-like tones, 
which he had adopted lately, had to be dispensed with, and this 
is a positive development. 
  [Ballardin] Major exponents of the international press 
continue to define you as neofascists. Is this definition 
correct or unfair? 
  [Fini] One of the reasons why I will not join the government 
is precisely in order to explain what we really are to the 
international public opinion. Since I would probably not manage 
to perform two such important tasks at the same time, as are 
leading a party and acting as a minister, I have decided to 
continue to lead AN, precisely so as to dispel any doubts 
concerning our identity. 
  [Ballardin] Would you rather be called neofascists or 
postfascists? 
  [Fini] Last January, when it was set up, AN clearly 
explained 
that it did not constitute a neofascist Right, but a European 
Right, that believes in freedom and democracy, and that can be 
defined as post-fascist. 
  [Ballardin] [League ideologue] Miglio stated that he was 
very 
satisfied with the first meeting with AN experts on federalism. 
  [Fini] Miglio knows very well that, for us, the federal 
model 
cannot certainly be based on Miglio's three different Italies, 
or his macroregions. The study conducted by the Agnelli 
Foundation might constitute a good starting point. We believe 
in the importance of having a powerful counterweight, in the 
form of a directly elected prime minister, who should have 
greater powers than at present. 
  [Ballardin] Speaking of the government, should [Radical 
leader] Pannella become a minister? 
  [Fini] Personally I have many reservations -- among other 
reasons, because the Radicals' position on drugs is the opposite 
of ours. 
  [Ballardin] Should the League be given the Interior 
Ministry? 
  [Fini] A coalition government can only be formed if its 
composition is agreed among all the partners involved. It is 
still too early to discuss the various portfolios.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Regions Enter Federalist Debate </F>
With Initiative"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Florence, April 9 -- The central Italian 
regions of Tuscany, Emilia Romagna, Umbria and the Marche, which 
bucked the rightist trend in Italy's recent elections, have 
begun their own initiative on the question of federalism, in 
favor of the German model over the American one and stressing 
how any change must be the result of consensus between majority 
and opposition. 
  The regions are slated to meet here on Wednesday [13 April] 
in an effort to play a more active role in the federalist 
debate, which until now has been dominated by the Northern 
League, and to stress the need to reconcile federalism with 
national unity, the basis of which they claim would be the 
creation of a House of Regions. 
  The president of the Region of Tuscany, Vannino Chiti, 
explained here on Saturday how "The federalism we envision as 
Italian regions and promoters of this initiative foresees a new 
balance of powers and responsibilities between the central state 
and the regions." 
  "The problem of the so-called macro-regions," he added, 
"arises when the debate on federalism is shifted to questions of 
sovereignty. But, in this case, the issue becomes confederalism 
and not federalism. The responsibilities of the regions cannot 
be expanded from the center nor can they put national unity into 
question." 
  Given these considerations, Chiti went on to argue how, for 
Italy, the best federalist model would be Germany, "also because 
it would be better adapt to the European Union. Those of the 
League are wrong to point to the example of the United States, 
which is too different for tradition, culture and size." In 
Chiti's view, the blueprint mapped out between Northern League 
leader Umberto Bossi and Giancarlo Fini of the National Alliance 
"would violate important rules of democratic behavior." 
  "In all democratic nations" he observed, "the rules 
governing 
democratic life are the result of a consensus between the 
majority and the opposition. One cannot conceive of making 
institutional reforms over the heads of almost half of 
parliament and of the regions which are supposed to be part of 
the reform of the state." 
  The regions' federalist initiative, on the other hand, "is 
of 
an institutional type" Chiti said, and added "We cannot tolerate 
that one force, which presents itself to be more contradictory 
than one could imagine, can impose on or discriminate against an 
important economic reality for the nation." 
  The federalist debate now moves to next week's conference of 
the presidents of all Italian regions from which a proposal is 
expected to be agreed on which can then be brought to the 
attention of the head of state. 
  (The argument that constitutional reform cannot be forced on 
by a parliamentary majority was also underscored in Rome today 
by Raffaele Costa, head of the Centrist Union which was part of 
the winning Freedom Alliance. Constitutions, he said, cannot be 
changed through the will of a simple majority, but must also be 
the result of a consensus with the opposition).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "1993 Economic Report, 1994 </F>
Forecasts"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 8 -- Inflation will drop from 4.2 
to 3.5 percent, gross domestic product will increase 1.3 percent 
and between 200,000 and 300,000 new jobs will be created by the 
end of the year, according to the 1994 economic forecasts 
presented to the cabinet on Friday [8 April] by Budget Minister 
Luigi Spaventa. 
  Economic recovery will begin to show only this summer and 
will be slightly below the government's expectations because 
recession was deeper than previously estimated and eased only 
starting at the very end of 1993, according to Spaventa's 
report. While exports will continue to do well this year and 
grow another 7 percent, imports will increase 3.5 percent, 
bringing the trade surplus to about 64 trillion lire (39 billion 
dollars) and the current accounts in the black by 32 trillion 
lire (19.5 billion dollars). 
  The weakness of the lira, according to government officials, 
was not the only reason the trade surplus boomed last year. 
Competitiveness of Italian products was enhanced considerably by 
the labor cost agreement reached last July, the officials 
claimed. Job losses however will continue at least until June 
but after the summer employment will pick up again and should 
rise to 0.6 percent from minus 2.8 percent in 1993. 
  Industrial production will rise 1.6 percent and services 
should also increase production by 1.3 percent, Spaventa said. 
  As for inflation, it should drop mostly thanks to slack 
price 
increases from abroad and the government's price containment 
policies, while gross labor costs should rise only 3 percent 
this year and interest rates will continue to come down, the 
report stated. 
  The deficit will be a tougher opponent to beat, Spaventa 
warned, saying that the 1993 recession and the delay in domestic 
recovery will delay further debt and deficit reductions. 
  The three finance ministers at the cabinet meeting also 
presented the 1993 economic report, confirming that GDP dropped 
0.7 percent (compared to -3.7 percent in 1992) and that 
unemployment reached an annual average rate of 10.4 percent 
because of 655,000 job losses, while inflation averaged 4.5 
percent against 5.2 percent in 1992. 
  Comparing 1992 to 1993, Spaventa said the balance of 
payments 
went from a deficit of 12.68 trillion lire to 32.51 trillion 
lire in the black, while the balance of payments went from 34.37 
trillion lire in the red to a surplus of 16.72 trillion lire. 
The deficit also fell from 158.8 trillion to 153.51 trillion 
lire. 
  Domestic demand fell 5 percent last year (compared to a 0.8 
percent increase in 1992) also because household incomes dropped 
2.1 percent and gross fixed investments plunged 11.1 percent in 
1993. 
  Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi after the meeting issued 
a communique warning Italy's economic press that false or 
inaccurate reporting of government economic forecasts and 
figures in the past have caused "grave political polemics," 
referring to allegations from Forza Italia during the election 
campaign that Spaventa had "falsified" his forecasts. 
  "Any polemics, even the harshest, should be based on sure 
and 
incontrovertible data, supplied (officially and not 
surreptitiously) by authorized public bodies," Ciampi said, also 
referring to figures from Spaventa's report leaked to the press 
last night. 
  "Conditions exist for a sustained and lasting economic 
recovery," Ciampi said, adding that the turning point "probably 
came between 1993 and 1994." 
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ciampi said he had 
some regrets because he "could have done more," but he stressed 
that the country's economic conditions were showing "clear signs 
of recovery." 
  The solution to recession "is old but still valid," he went 
on, adding that success "is assured if there are correct and 
healthy budget policies, a strict wage policy and monetary 
policies aimed at stability." 
  The government's greatest regret concerns persistently high 
unemployment but this was offset by falling inflation, an 
improved trade balance, the July labor cost agreement and a 
reduction in debt servicing, Ciampi said. Unfortunately, he 
went on, there is no miracle cure for unemployment. 
  "Jobs are protected by creating serious and competitive 
industries," which have been forced to reduce their labor force 
through restructuring, the premier said. He praised the trade 
unions for helping reduce wage hikes. As for the poorer south, 
Ciampi said the region's economic backwardness "is closely 
connected to social problems" caused by organized crime. 
  On foreign trade, one of the bright points since the de 
facto 
devaluation of the lira in September, Ciampi underscored the 
importance of exploiting last summer's inflation-pegging 
cost-of-labour accord if the export boom is to be maintained. 
"Results of extraordinary importance have been achieved in the 
balance of trade," he said, "enabling us to move in the space of 
a year from a current account deficit of 34 trillion lire to a 
surplus close to 34 trillion, or over 3 percent of GDP." 
  He said this put the economy in a position to face 1994 "in 
a 
totally different viewpoint" as regards competitiveness and 
quality. 
  On public finances, he pointed to another "considerable" 
result: curbing the PSBR/GDP [Public Service Borrowing 
Requirement/Gross Domestic Product] ratio to below 10 percent 
"for the first time in many years" -- although he recognised 
that some of the credit was due to falling interest rates that 
slashed debt servicing costs. 
  On his government's budgets and use of the tax lever, Ciampi 
expressed "no regrets" in easing the fiscal pressure inherited 
from the Amato government and shifting corrective priorities to 
spending cuts. 
  "My government enacted budgets to the tune of 40 trillion 
lire, but we couldn't squeeze the fiscal screw any tighter," 
Ciampi said, "because it would have stifled the recovery; that's 
why we turned to the spending side, with important results." 
  A bigger budget squeeze "would only have had a nominal 
effect 
because revenue would have been lower, meaning lower tax returns 
and higher social protection spending." 
  Ciampi again pointed to the objective of lowering fiscal 
pressure by 1.2 percent this year, and praised finance minister 
Franco Gallo for simplifying tax procedures. "Just look at the 
new personal income tax form," he said. 
  Another goal he said had been achieved was a fall in the 
cost 
of labour, also in Italy's traditionally sheltered civil service. 
  In noting the fall in Italy's debt interest payments, Ciampi 
voiced the hope that this would continue: "provided that we 
preserve the confidence and credibility we have won over the 
last year and a half."

<F P=106> [Report by Hugh Carnegy: "Swedes Enshrine Right To Know in </F>
Their EU Deal"] 
  [Text] Stockholm -- Amid all the wrangles over voting 
rights, fishing rights and farm subsidies in the European 
Union's [EU] enlargement negotiations last month, a declaration 
by Sweden attached to its accession accord with Brussels passed 
almost unnoticed. 
  It asserted Sweden's right to continue to exercise a deeply 
entrenched policy of open government and freedom of information. 
  Such is the importance attached in Sweden to the principle 
of 
open government that Stockholm felt it necessary to include the 
declaration in its EU accession documents to reassure voters 
worried that joining the EU might erode citizens, right of 
access to state-held information. 
  The most celebrated example is the right all Swedes have to 
read the official correspondence of the prime minister -- 
without delay. 
  "Actually the way it works it is possible sometimes for a 
reporter to see some non-urgent letters before the minister," 
says Mr Goran Schader, a senior official at the justice ministry. 
  Public officials are explicitly given the right to leak 
information as part of their rights to the freedom of 
expression. Early this year, most of the details of the 1994-95 
budget were published in the national newspapers several days 
before Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, presented them to 
parliament. 
  The country's first freedom of the press legislation was 
enacted in 1766. The current freedom of the press law which 
enshrines the principle of open government was passed in 1949 
and is part of the written constitution. 
  All ministries and local authorities are obliged to keep a 
register of completed documents which citizens can freely peruse 
and have access to, like a public library. 
  There are, however, seven areas where the state may withhold 
information, ranging from state security, through currency 
policy and individual privacy to the protection of animals and 
plants, with restrictions up to 20 years. 
  Swedish officials and politicians of all parties boast that 
the policy of open government has ensured a virtual lack of 
public corruption. "It makes everyone aware that they are 
operating in the public eye," says Mr Schader. "It encourages 
efficiency and the fair treatment of every case." 
  Some Swedes feel access is too open, especially information 
about private individuals that can be obtained by fellow 
citizens. Details of individual income taxes are publicly 
available, for example. There is also a campaign to make the 
possession of child pornography a crime. 
  In case European leaders may fret that their confidential 
musings in EU council meetings might suddenly pop up in 
publicly-available Swedish briefing papers, Mr Schader points 
out that any threat of damage to foreign relations is a case for 
restricting information under the secrecy law. 
  "We have conducted foreign relations for centuries without 
this being a problem. I don't think anyone should feel that you 
can't tell Sweden something for fear of it suddenly appearing on 
the front page of the newspapers."

  [Text] Ankara -- Turkey's Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin 
has called upon Germany to issue a "clear and unconditional no 
to terrorism." Cetin told DPA in Ankara on Friday [8 April] 
that he has no doubt that accusations saying that German arms 
are used in internal conflicts against Kurdish extremists, 
against the rules of bilateral and NATO agreements, will prove 
false. 
  Turkey is facing "separatist terrorism by the Workers Party 
of Kurdistan [PKK]." Turkey must, therefore, be allowed "to 
defend itself with the means of a democratic constitutional 
state." PKK terrorism must not be regarded as a fight for 
freedom by the Kurds, the Social Democratic foreign minister of 
Kurdish descent said. 
  According to the semi-official news agency ANADOLU, the 
parliamentary state secretary in the Federal Interior Ministry, 
Eduard Lintner, said at a German-Turkish symposium in Istanbul 
on Friday that the suspension of German arms supplies is mainly 
due to "aggressive television programs" directed against Turkey. 
  According to Anadolu, Lintner said: "Some leftist groups are 
out of work now that South Africa is no longer a topic, and now 
they are concentrating on Turkey." According to the ANADOLU 
report, Lintner went on to say that Germany is the country where 
the PKK is most active outside Turkey. This has created the 
impression that the Kurds are those that are "oppressed" and the 
Turks are the "oppressors." It is, therefore, necessary to tell 
the German public the truth, Lintner said, according to ANADOLU.

  [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- On Monday [11 April], Turkey warned 
Germany against "provocations and anti-Turkish propaganda from 
the camp of the opponents of good German-Turkish relations." 
Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said in Ankara on Monday 
that "normal military cooperation" will also continue after last 
Thursday's halting of arms deliveries. The auxiliary supplies 
within the framework of NATO defense aid are affected. 
  Cetin affirmed that Turkey continues to adhere to the 
conditions and is using the BTR-60 and BTR-80 armored personnel 
carriers supplied by Germany from the stocks of the GDR People's 
Army in the internal controversy with Kurdish extremists from 
the ranks of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). He thinks it 
is completely normal that the FRG Government is taking the time 
to follow up on the accusations because of the tremendous 
domestic policy pressure and to examine whether the arms 
delivered from Germany were used in violation of the agreements, 
which, however, is not the case.

  [Excerpt] Willy Claes confirmed to the Chamber of Deputies 
just now that at least six Belgian civilians have been killed in 
the troubles in Rwanda. Until now it had been announced that 
three Belgians had died. The minister of foreign affairs was 
answering questions from deputies belonging to the chamber's 
Foreign Affairs Commission. Over now to Andre Menu: 
  [Menu] Sixteen Belgians have been killed in the tragic 
events 
in Rwanda: Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers and six civilians -- 
three in Gisenyi and three in Kigali. This happened in the 
first few days. 
  The Belgian peacekeepers were providing protection for the 
Rwandan prime minister, who was murdered. They were surprised 
by a large number of Rwandan nationals and executed the next 
night in a Rwandan camp. That was what Leo Delcroix, the 
minister of defense, reported this afternoon. 
  But it was Willy Claes who defined the stance adopted by the 
government, whose main aim is to ensure people's security, to 
take the least possible number of risks and to organize the 
evacuation of our nationals. But for Willy Claes the latest 
tragic events in Rwanda mean that questions have to be raised on 
the effectiveness of the current mandate of the peacekeeping 
troops. As is known, the mandate is extremely limited. 
Belgium's attitude in the future must also depend on guarantees 
that a real democratization process in the country will succeed, 
Willy Claes said. 
  There will be a debate in parliament on the future position 
to be adopted by Belgium. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, April 10 [dateline as received] (AFP) -- 
The Brussels branch of the humanitarian organisation Medecins 
sans Frontieres (MSF [Doctors Without Borders]) is pulling its 
Belgian staff out of Rwanda, an MSF spokesman said here Monday 
[11 April]. 
  MSF officials said they were alarmed at a wave of 
anti-Belgian sentiment since the little African country started 
sliding into civil war last Thursday. Belgium is Rwanda's 
former colonial power. 
  The spokesman said some of the organisation's members were 
stranded at Ruhengery in northern Rwanda. 
  But he added that MSF staff of other nationalities were 
heading for Kigali to assist at the town's embattled and 
over-crowded hospital, and for a hospital and refugee camps at 
the southern town of Butare. 
  The MSF spokesman said people running the Butare camps and 
hospital had abandoned them, leaving more than 150,000 refugees 
and about 100 hospital patients without support. 
  Meanwhile, the European Union said it had granted ECU500,000 
(560,000 dollars) in emergency aid for the victims of the civil 
war in Rwanda. 
  A spokesman for the EU's executive European Commission said 
the money would help fund the despatch by MSF of a medical team 
plus surgical supplies to Kigali. 
  The Belgian Government on Sunday announced an eight million 
franc (332,000 dollars) grant to MSF to fund a plane load of 
medical supplies for Kigali. 
  A European Commission spokesman said most EU officials in 
Kigali had been evacuated since a new round of bloodshed started 
in Rwanda on Thursday and the two remaining officials were due 
to leave later Monday.

  [Excerpts] Two planes carrying a total of near 400 refugees 
from Rwanda landed at Zaventem airport near Brussels this 
morning. The refugees, most of them Belgian nationals, had first 
been airlifted in Army planes from Kigali to Nairobi in Kenya. 
The refugees were immediately transferred to the military 
hospital at Neder Over Heembeek near Zaventem. 
  The passengers of the first aircraft, which landed at 0230, 
were welcomed by King Albert, Queen Paula, and Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes. 
  Many refugees had tales of horror to tell and were shocked 
by 
what they had seen. This physician had waited in relative 
security in a hotel until he was evacuated by the troops. 
  [Begin unidentified refugee recording] What I saw myself? At 
first we heard the shooting, and the hotel itself was hit by the 
bullets. And the last day when we started, I saw a van full 
with bodies, dead bodies that they were going to put in a 
garden, I suppose to make a hole. [end recording] 
  A third flight from Nairobi carrying 400 refugees is 
scheduled to land at Brussels at 1445 local time. They too will 
be met by the king and queen. [passage omitted] 
  The Belgian Red Cross has airlifted 20 tonnes of medical 
equipment and medicines to Rwanda. The Boeing 707 flew to 
Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, from which the goods will be 
transported to Kigali in a convoy of cars and trucks. The 
operation is partly funded by the Belgian Development 
Cooperation Department. 
  A total of more than 600 Belgians have now been evacuated 
from Kigali. Today the Belgian paracommandos will try to bring 
the remaining few hundred Belgians to safety. [passage omitted]

Front Representative in Brussels by unattributed correspondent; 
date not given: "Rwandan Patriotic Front Launches Siege of 
Kigali"] 
  [Excerpts] At least 4,000 RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] 
rebels are fighting their way from the north to Kigali. For 
what purpose? This time does the RPF want to do what it says it 
has never seriously tried in four years of war: To take the 
capital? "Yes," says the RPF spokesman in Brussels bluntly. "We 
are going to take Kigali in order to restore order and 
neutralize the extremists who are terrorizing and murdering our 
people." [passage omitted] 
  "The new government consists exclusively of Hutu hawks," the 
RPF spokesman in Brussels said. "People who were on [former 
President] Habyarimana's side and who always boycotted the 
Arusha peace agreement. These are the people who have decimated 
the opposition. This is a government which is based on terror. 
We continue to stick by the three basic principles of Arusha: 
The goal of a state based on the rule of law, power sharing in 
a transitional period, and the merger of the two military forces 
into one army. In the interests of the peace agreement we are 
trying to take out the anti-Arusha forces. Indeed, we are doing 
that with arms in hand. Just as the Belgians and French are 
rushing to help their fellow countrymen, we are trying to save 
our people. And by our people, we do not just mean Tutsis by a 
long shot. The terror of recent days was directed against all 
those who were not extreme Hutu hawks. We are going to end this 
regime's potential to kill." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, April 11 (AFP) -- Belgium's controversial 
policy of neutrality towards Rwanda, its former colony, has left 
fearful Belgians there exposed to a propaganda hate campaign, 
Belgian African specialists said here Monday [11 April]. 
  The Belgian media has said Belgians are being singled out 
among the hundreds of foreigners being evacuated from Rwanda and 
subjected to harassment, theft and sometimes beatings. 
  At least three Belgian civilians have been murdered in the 
orgy of ethnic bloodletting which has left thousands dead since 
Thursday, as well as 10 Belgian members of the UN Assistance 
Force in Rwanda. 
  Former Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said: "The 10 
soldiers and the murdered Belgian civilians were victims of the 
hatred created intentionally by certain Rwandan media." 
  Radio stations and groups supporting the government in 
Rwanda 
have accused Belgian troops of shooting down the aircraft which 
crashed over Kigali on Wednesday, killing presidents Juvenal 
Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi. 
  The crash sent the country sliding towards civil war between 
the majority Hutus, who hold political power, and the minority 
Tutsis, and torpedoed last August's Arusha agreement to 
reconcile the two groups in a new government. 
  The Belgian government was allowed to land aircraft at 
Kigali 
airport on Sunday to begin evacuating its 1,500 to 2,000 
nationals in Rwanda only after protracted negotiations with the 
Rwandan authorities. 
  Filip Reyntjens, a specialist on Rwanda at the University of 
Antwerp, said hard line elements of the majority Hutu Rwandan 
army were accusing Belgium of supporting the rebel Tutsi Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF). 
  Belgian Defence Minister Leo Delcroix acknowledged that 
France was the first country to begin an evacuation effort from 
Rwanda because it had better relations than the Belgians with 
the Rwandan military. 
  But while Belgium has been vilified by the Hutu hardliners 
for wanting to bring the minority Tutsis into a coalition 
government, France has been criticised for backing the Hutu 
power structure in place. 
  One Rwandan civil rights group accused France during the 
weekend of backing the Rwandan government with massive supplies 
of arms, logistical support and training of the Rwandan army and 
the hardline presidential guard. 
  It was the presidential guard which killed the 10 Belgian UN 
soldiers as they unsuccessfully tried to stop the murder of 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingyamana. 
  The Brussels-based Committee for the Respect of Human Rights 
and Democracy in Rwanda said it was fearful of the "negative 
consequences" of a new French military presence in Rwanda. 
  Reyntjens said Belgium was paying the price of pulling out 
its troops from Rwanda in 1990 at the start of the Rwandan civil 
war when rebels of the Tutsi RPF began their struggle for power. 
  He said Belgium was accused of not supporting "a reliable 
friend," of not delivering arms already paid for, and of 
insisting on respect for human rights. 
  The Belgian newspaper LIBRE BELGIQUE said: "While Paris 
continued to support the regime of President Habyarimana, as 
French leaders have done in other African states with a strong 
regime, Belgium showed more neutrality, opting resolutely for 
the democratisation of the Kigali regime and Tutsi participation 
in government." 
  The French have been pressured from the other side. RPF 
spokesmen warned at the weekend that the French military would 
be attacked by the rebels if it tried to play any role in Rwanda 
beyond the evacuation of foreigners. 
  By contrast, the French are having a much easier time than 
the Belgians in Kigali. "You are French? That's OK then, you 
can pass," a Rwandan soldier said at one roadblock.

<F P=106> [Article signed KvdB: "Poll: Scandal Atmosphere Pushing </F>
Socialist Party Down to 15.3 Percent"] 
  [Text] The scandal atmosphere which swept through the 
socialist movement in March has left deep scars. The March 
poll, which was conducted by Dimarso on behalf of DE MORGEN, 
revealed that the SP [Socialist Party] has to settle for only 
15.3 percent of the votes. This is a decrease by 2.1 percent. 
The French-speaking sister party, the PS, had already been the 
victim of the scandals around "the three Guys" in December and 
January. In March, Busquin's party fell back to only 30.5 
percent of the votes. As a result, the socialist family is now, 
for the first time since 1919, only the third political 
formation in Belgium. SP and PS combined, get only 19.7 percent 
of the Belgian votes. CVP [Christian People's Party] and PSC 
[Social Christian Party] score 19.9 percent, while the liberals 
are the largest family with 27.4 percent. In Flanders, Agalev 
[Live Differently] made great progress in March: from 11.3 to 
13.5 percent. This is also an historic record. The CVP 
continues to concede ground (21 percent), the liberals rose 
slightly (to 29.2 percent), but no longer exceed the 30 percent 
limit. According to Dimarso, the federal coalition has only 
39.6 percent of the votes left. The Walloon majority barely 
reaches 51 percent, while the SP-CVP-VU [People's Union] 
coalition in Flanders has only 42.2 percent.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Colette Braeckman: "Rwanda, Burundi: The </F>
Deterioration"] 
  [Text] In Rwanda and Burundi, there had been signs of hope. 
After three years of war, but also after the opening up to a 
multiparty system, the Arusha agreements accepted by all the 
Rwandan protagonists, had laid the foundations for a fairer 
distribution of power, for a peaceful transition to democratic 
elections. 
  The United Nations, which is now so reluctant to be involved 
on multiple fronts, had agreed, at Belgium's insistence, to 
sponsor the peace process. In Burundi, exemplary democratic 
elections had brought to power FRODEBU [Burundi Democratic 
Front] headed by President Ndadaye, a moderate. 
  In both cases, the change was dramatically interrupted 
despite the fact that peaceful transitional structures existed 
and that a "civilian society" -- free press, human rights 
defense associations -- were becoming increasingly active. 
  What therefore happened to bring about the failure of 
reforms 
and national reconciliations amid bloodshed? In both cases, we 
have witnessed the obstinacy of the ruling political class, 
which refused to give up or share power. For the Burundian 
Army, or at least for the most radical of its officers, there 
was no question of seeing a Hutu become president. In Rwanda, 
in President Habyarimana's entourage, a group of political 
racketeers who benefited more from war than from peace grew up, 
and they did not intend to share the "national cake" with other 
regional or ethnic groups and were even more intransigent than 
the defunct president himself. 
  In addition to these internal obstacles, the external 
context 
is not very favorable to democracy: In Uganda, President 
Museveni is the determined opponent of a multiparty system which 
he regards as a source of tribal struggles. Is there any need 
to recall the interminable crisis which has paralyzed 
neighboring Zaire, making it impossible to implement the 
resolutions of the national conference? Paradoxically, (but is 
it really unintentional paradox?) the violent chaos which 
currently reigns in Rwanda is strengthening the position of the 
region's "strong men" who are becoming synonymous with stability. 
  The hopes of the nineties have misfired in Africa, and, in 
many countries on the continent, democracy has been wiped out, 
less because of a so-called immaturity on the part of the 
peoples than because of the refusal of the leadership classes to 
bow to the verdict of the polls or majority rule. It is also 
because of the faintheartedness of the "Western friends" who 
were arguing for change but without having the courage to 
effectively support those who believed in their democratic 
statements. 
  The power vacuum, the political crisis in these two African 
great lakes countries are now forcing the Western countries, and 
more especially Belgium, the former colonial power and the 
leader in terms of cooperation, to face their responsibilities. 
  Brussels, in the framework of the United Nations, has 
already 
started to play a positive role in Rwanda, but it has tragically 
abandoned the Burundian democrats, turning a deaf ear to the 
appeals from Bujumbura at a time when a rapid intervention would 
have saved thousands of civilians, Hutus and Tutsis. It is true 
that Belgium was not stingy in its humanitarian assistance after 
the event. 
  Today, the same choices face us, even more urgently than 
before. First, because there is no guarantee that the lives of 
expatriates will not be threatened in the general conflagration. 
Finally because, especially in Rwanda, the opposition leaders, 
the human rights campaigners, and priests are being killed or 
imprisoned, the United Nations' authority is being flouted, and 
thousands of human lives are in danger. 
  The duty of humanitarian intervention is stronger than ever. 
For the sake of democracy, but primarily for the sake of human 
solidarity toward peoples in danger.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Robert Verdussen: "The Choice for Democracy"] </F>
  [Text] Belgium has been caught, not for the first time but 
more seriously than ever before, in the Rwandan trap. A trap 
from which it is proving very difficult to escape. 
  Although the anti-Belgian feelings aroused in the last few 
days have not resulted in a "Belgian manhunt" such as some were 
rather too quick to speak of, Belgium nevertheless finds itself 
in a very unenviable position in Rwanda today. Is this the 
thankless and inevitable role of any former colonial power? No 
doubt. But the colonial past cannot explain everything. 
  The difficulties encountered by Belgian leaders in coming to 
the assistance of expatriates threatened by further troubles 
more certainly have their origins in a more recent past. The 
past of a Rwanda which, like most African countries, has been 
touched by the wave of democratization born at the end of the 
Cold War. A wave resisted by the "strongarm" regime of 
President Habyarimana but which also pushed the Tutsi minority 
to "try its luck" in the only way possible, that of armed 
rebellion. 
  Faced with this new situation, Belgium could have continued 
to support a regime whose principal virtue was its strength or, 
alternatively, it could have played the democratic card. It 
chose the latter option. Was it right to do so? Or should it, 
like France, have continued to side with an antiquated 
single-party system? 
  Such a choice would have amounted to a pragmatism which 
although not very honorable would probably have been more 
effective, at least in the short term. Instead, it chose to 
gamble in the longer term on improved human rights on a 
continent where, sooner or later, they are confronted by the 
compromises of leaders who are still too often encouraged by a 
West which prefers trading security to the risks inherent in 
introducing democracy. 
  Democratization has failed in Rwanda. And this failure has 
caught Belgium in the trap. But does this mean that Belgium 
should stand accused? Should it stand accused for having chosen 
to take a chance rather than for the status quo, and for human 
rights rather than oppression? Belgium has lost. For now.

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Text] The government today strongly backed the use of NATO 
airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces besieging Gorazde in 
eastern Bosnia. 
  Answering the opposition's emergency question in the Lords 
shortly after a second attack, Foreign Office Minister of State 
Baroness Chalker described the action as "prompt and 
appropriate." She said: "We hope that all parties will draw 
appropriate lessons from the use of air power and that attacks 
on the safe areas will now cease." 
  Lady Chalker acknowledged that Britain had not been 
consulted before yesterday's air strike against the Bosnian Serb 
forces by NATO war planes, but stressed that the government 
would not have expected to have been. She said authority for 
"close air support" was delegated by the UN secretary general to 
his special representatives and by NATO to relevant military 
commanders. Humanitarian convoys crossing Bosnian Serb areas and 
some aid flights into Sarajevo had been temporarily suspended, 
she told peers. "We hope they will be able to resume shortly 
and the considerable progress made over the last few months will 
continue." 
  In her statement, Lady Chalker told peers that the 
government 
had only just received reports of the second NATO attack and had 
no further information available at present. "The action taken 
yesterday by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and NATO has our 
full support," she said. "The decision was taken in accordance 
with normal UN and Nato procedures. UNPROFOR is neutral and not 
a party to the conflict but has the right of self defence. On 
this occasion the risk to UNPROFOR personnel was thought by 
UNPROFOR commanders to warrant a request to Nato for air 
support. I'm sure the House will welcome the prompt and 
appropriate action taken by NATO in support of UN personnel and 
with the full support of both organisations. We hope the 
parties will be able to agree to a global cessation of 
hostilities in Bosnia as a first step to an overall political 
settlement." 
  Lord Richard, Labour leader in the Lords, said if it was 
true 
Bosnian Serb forces were endangering UN forces and civilian 
personnel it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the 
Serbs had "brought this on themselves." 
  He asked: "What steps are being taken to protect UNPROFOR 
forces and particularly British troops against the possibility 
of retaliation?" He also asked what had been the response of 
the Russian Government to the air strikes. 
  Lady Chalker said: "We have heard that President Yeltsin has 
stated his concern that Russia wasn't consulted before 
yesterday's incident. The authority for close air support was 
delegated by the UN secretary general to his special 
representatives and by NATO to relevant military commanders. 
The UK Government wasn't consulted. We didn't expect to be 
consulted and we were not aware that any other NATO ally was 
being consulted -- so there was no reason why the Russian 
Government should have been consulted." 
  On the possibility of Serb retaliation, the minister 
warned: "If there is retaliation we might need to retaliate with 
close air support in the future." But she stressed that such 
action would only be taken after careful consideration and if it 
was fully justified. 
  For the Liberal Democrats, Lord Bonham-Carter said it might 
have been wise to have consulted the Russians before carrying 
out the bombing. He stressed: "It is extremely important that 
we do everything in our power to keep the Russians in step." 
  Lady Chalker told him that authority had been given to the 
UN secretary general. No nation should be "seeking to second 
guess" the issue, she added. 
  Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Merlyn-Rees asked if the 
minister thought the action would be sufficient to deter the 
Serbs. 
  Lady Chalker replied: "I sincerely hope that the Serb 
authorities will see that NATO and the UN mean business." 
  She said the chance for peace had been going well until it 
was "quite clearly" broken by the Serbian advance on Friday: 
"That advance has to be stopped." 
  Tory former Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham asked if 
yesterday's attack had been effective. Lady Chalker said: "I 
cannot give you the exact detail. From general reporting that I 
have heard on the radio, it does seem that the strikes went home 
to stop a communication centre." 
  Labour's Lord Stoddart of Swindon urged her to comment on 
reports that UNPROFOR observers in Gorazde included an SAS 
[Special Air Service] member who had directed fire onto Serb 
positions. But she told him: "It is long-standing policy not to 
comment on special forces matters. Beyond that I can make no 
further comment today." 
  Tory the Earl of Onslow asked: "What happens if the Serbs 
are 
not deterred?" Lady Chalker insisted the Serbs had been 
deterred: "They were certainly deterred as far as Sarejevo was 
concerned."

<F P=106> [Report by Richard Savill: "Leave World of Violence, </F>
Reynolds Urges IRA"] 
  [Text] Belfast -- Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime 
minister, urged the IRA to break out of its "cocooned world of 
idealistic violence" yesterday and make a positive response to 
the Downing Street Declaration on Ulster's future. 
  His appeal came as the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] said 
it expected an increase in violence after the IRA launched a 
spate of weekend attacks to mark the end of its 72-hour 
cease-fire. 
  Police suspected the IRA of involvement in at least six 
incidents, including gun and mortar attacks on police and Army 
checkpoints, after the failure of the cease-fire to draw Mr 
Major into dialogue with Sinn Fein. 
  Mr Reynolds voiced his disappointment at the cease-fire's 
short duration and he said time was running out for Sinn Fein 
and the IRA. 
  "I think the time for deliberations should end now," he 
said. 
"There are too many lives lost already. It is not worth the 
loss of another innocent life." 
  Despite the end of the cease-fire, Mr Reynolds said the 
search for a permanent end to violence would continue. 
  "One has to appreciate that the IRA are in a cocooned world 
of their own, of idealistic violence, and it is going to take 
some time for them to break out of that and recognise the world 
around them wants peace and that the people in both communities 
want peace and they want it now. 
  ``I think there is an urgency about their own deliberations 
and they cannot keep deliberating forever. We need decisions 
and we need them fast. At the end of the day, the momentum that 
is there among the ordinary people for peace will win through 
and everybody will eventually come back to the Downing Street 
declaration.'' 
  He believed the cease-fire was a "very small step" along the 
long road to peace. "Now that they have taken the first step, 
let's hope the second step will be for a much longer period that 
will eventually lead to a permanent peace." 
  Mr Reynolds said he had not expected Mr Major to contact 
Sinn 
Fein during the cease-fire. "Everybody recognises the position 
of John Major at the moment and I certainly wasn't expecting him 
to do that at this stage." 
  "They would need a longer cease-fire than just three days 
for 
people to expect them to respond." 
  He promised that Dublin would not "go soft" on the IRA in 
the 
coming months. "We have never been soft with them. Our 
security forces will continue to do their job as they have 
always done." 
  Mr Reynolds's comments came as the outlawed Loyalist 
paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association [UDA], 
threatened to extend its terror campaign to the Irish Republic. 
  The statement comes in the wake of a recent warning by Sir 
Hugh Annesley, RUC Chief Constable, that loyalists are 
developing a sophisticated bomb-making ability which might be 
used in the Republic . 
  In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, two men who said 
they represented the UDA, also said it would continue its 
activities even if the IRA calls a permanent cease-fire. 
  The men, who described themselves as the heads of the UDA's 
south-east Antrim and south Belfast battalions, said the 
organisation had drawn up contingency plans in the event of 
civil war which they believed was moving closer. 
  They said loyalists should also be given clarification of 
the 
declaration and they said Dublin had to abandon its 
constitutional claims on Northern Ireland. 
  Meanwhile, Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and 
Labour Party, said British soldiers patrolling Ulster's streets 
were backing his peace efforts. 
  Mr Hume, who has engaged in dialogue with Mr Gerry Adams, 
the 
Sinn Fein president, criticised Rightwing Tory MPs and urged 
them to put peace in Northern Ireland above the "internal 
squabbles" in their party. 
  "The young soldiers in the streets know more about our 
problems than those Right wing backbenchers," Mr Hume said on 
GMTV's [Good Morning Television] Sunday Best programme.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Gerhard Fuchs and </F>
Sigmund Gottlieb in Bad Hofgastein; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Fuchs] Mr. Chancellor, last Sunday's opinion 
polls showed that approval for the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] was at 36 percent. This is 
the worst result since 1949. Heiner Geissler said: I, as former 
secretary general, feel sick when I look at these figures. How 
will you go about winning the Bundestag elections? 
  [Kohl] I do not know why Heiner Geissler feels sick. As 
former secretary general he should know that polls and election 
results are two completely different things. We are entering 
the so-called marathon election year. It will be a very 
difficult year. There will be a number of municipal and diet 
elections, as well as the European and the Bundestag elections. 
I am convinced that we will win the Bundestag elections. All 
the signs I see indicate that. Why should I discuss today's 
polls if the election result.... 
  [Fuchs] [words indistinct] 
  [Kohl] Let me give you an example. One cannot ignore the 
fact that the economy is slowly recovering. It is obvious that 
exports are rising. Industrial nations worldwide are getting 
out of the trough, the recession. Due to German unity we 
entered the recession two years later, and we will also get to 
leave it later. But the figures are clear. It will not be a 
super upward movement, but the mood in industry is just like 
spring. Nature is waking up, there is an upward trend. This 
applies to western Germany, and to a much greater extent to 
eastern Germany. 
  [Gottlieb] At the CDU party conference you said clearly that 
a grand coalition is out of the question for you. You stated 
just as clearly that a coalition with the Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] continues to be desirable, not out of love, but out of 
reason. Now, the FDP is quite weak at the moment, it stands at 
about 5 percent, and they are duly avoiding making a clear 
coalition statement. When will you tell Mr. Kinkel to make up 
his mind? 
  [Kohl] First, I think that it is a preelection tradition to 
downgrade the FDP. We want to -- I want to continue the 
coalition with the FDP; mainly because we worked together very 
well and because I do not see an alternative. A Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]/Greens coalition would 
certainly lead the country into isolation. 
  [Gottlieb] But Mr. Kinkel does not make a statement. 
  [Kohl] Second, I have no doubt that the FDP will make a 
statement. 
  [Gottlieb] When? 
  [Kohl] They will certainly do this in due course. There is 
no hurry. The FDP is much too clever to ignore the fact that 
you cannot work well for four years, say in the election 
campaign: we have worked well for four years, and then not take 
a clear position. This means, we have European elections in a 
few weeks' time, in June, and there are municipal and diet 
elections. It is clear that the FDP will say what it has to say 
before that. I do not have a problem, and I have a lot of 
patience. The FDP knows what is good for it. And everything 
else is certainly bad for it. I am warning against a premature 
conclusion, as we have often had it in the past: The FDP now 
holds at 5 percent, it will probably not make it. This was a 
popular thing when Genscher was chairman. First the situation 
was depicted as unfavorable, and then there are a lot of people 
who say: we want the FDP all the same. I do not doubt that the 
FDP will get over the 5-percent hurdle. It will achieve a 
better result. 
  [Fuchs] Mr. Chancellor, you have had a strong partner in 
the south, the Bavarian CSU. Now the CSU has been making 
negative headlines for weeks. How will you make it in Bonn if 
the CSU does not make a major contribution? 
  [Kohl] It is no coincidence that what is going on in Bavaria 
is happening a few weeks before the elections. I would like to 
take this opportunity to say a few clear words on the attacks 
that are now being made on [late CSU chairman] Franz Josef 
Strauss. Franz Josef Strauss is one of the great architects of 
the FRG. He achieved great things for Germany and for Bavaria. 
Today's Bavaria is his achievement to a great extent. I can 
say this without reservations, because I am one of those who had 
a lot of conflicts with him when he was still alive. This is 
the first thing I would like to say about this. The second 
thing is that I trust that my friends in the CSU will do what is 
necessary to explain the recent incidents. Accusations have 
been made by people who are in very ambiguous positions 
themselves. This must be explained. But the CSU's 
achievements, the achievements of Franz Josef Strauss, are 
undisputed, and I think we will be able to express this clearly 
to Bavarian voters. 
  [Gottlieb] Let me come back to another point, Mr. 
Chancellor. It is undisputed that the Liberals are getting 
weaker right now -- this may change again -- and the Greens have 
become stronger. At the moment, a lot points toward an 
SPD/Greens coalition. Such an alliance is no longer feared by 
the people, they have become respectable. Should Helmut Kohl 
not be afraid of such a coalition? 
  [Kohl] How do you know that SPD/Greens would be accepted by 
the people in Bundestag elections? This has not been tried. We 
had an election this year -- SPD/Greens -- in Lower Saxony. Let 
me tell you, in view of the fact that Lower Saxony's minister 
president had all the means of power and the media at his 
disposal, the result was not all that overwhelming. He repeated 
his previous result. If I had had such a result in Rhineland 
Palatinate in 1975 before I was candidate for chancellor, people 
would have said, and they did say: This is not enough. 
  [Gottlieb] The CDU's election result in Lower Saxony was 
worse. 
  [Kohl] Excuse me, the CDU was in a difficult starting 
position. A young, new man achieved an acceptable result. This 
is my opinion. I cannot see the voters seeing it that way. It 
is a matter of dramatic change, the future of Germany is at 
stake. We have to stop and see what we can improve, where we 
have to rethink. I do not think that the SPD/Greens are the 
right choice in a period when we are beginning a slow economic 
recovery -- with more bureaucracy, punishment of hard work, with 
all the social envy, and everything else. I do not think that 
the majority of voters think so either. And I think that this 
is not a very sensible discussion. We will know for sure in 
October, and I am sure of my ground. 
  [Fuchs] There is a famous definition of the political 
center. The CDU says it wants to win the elections at the 
center. Your partner Theo Waigel, the CSU chairman, says: we 
have to win the elections to the right of center. What is the 
center, what is to the right of it, and what are the issues in 
the election campaign? 
  [Kohl] If you want to know precisely: For the CDU it is 
obvious, the center is where I am. That is undisputed. I have 
never thought much of moving to the left. I do not think much 
of going to the right either. 
  [Fuchs] But Waigel says: we have to win voters who are 
moving to the right. This means toward the Republikaner, for 
instance. 
  [Kohl] I think that there is a difference between the FRG as 
a whole and Bavaria. There has always been a difference. I 
have nothing against winning as many voters to the left and to 
the right of center as possible. But the basis of our party, 
its history, its tradition, is at the center, and we do not 
intend to let anyone else take that ground. 
  [Gottlieb] Your secretary general, Mr. Hintze, recently said 
very dramatically that the situation for the CDU is of 
particular concern in the new laender. It is below 30 percent 
everywhere except Saxony. Have you miscalculated the situation 
in the new laender? Have you underestimated the inherited 
burdens? 
  [Kohl] I think that we have all miscalculated on a few 
points, including myself. I miscalculated one particular point, 
or judged the situation incorrectly. In 1990, on the day of 
German unity, I expected economic cooperation, which I had 
developed with Gorbachev over the previous years, to continue. 
I did not think -- nor did anybody else -- that a few months 
later, less than a year later, the Soviet Union would no longer 
exist; that this giant would collapse, with successor states 
forming. That its successor states would deteriorate so badly 
economically, and that instead of 25-30 billion German marks 
[DM] in exports from the new laender to these states, we are 
achieving just DM5 billion this year. We lack the opportunity 
to export our products from the new laender, the former GDR, to 
these countries. We need a transition period to adjust the 
companies of the former GDR to the completely different 
standards of the world market. This has had drastic 
consequences. I miscalculated this point. But -- and this must 
also be acknowledged -- in the meantime things have stabilized, 
and there is a clear upward trend. GNP growth rates in the new 
laender will be between 6 and 8 percent this year. We can see 
that the labor market is stabilizing. There has been enormous 
progress. Just go to the new laender; wherever you go you will 
see progress in road construction and in other fields. This 
year we will grant just under 100,000 building permits in the 
new laender. This is an absolute record figure; permits have 
quadrupled over 1992. In just under three years, 1.8 million 
telephone connections have increased to over 4 million. Insofar 
as the people themselves, I would also like to give you a 
specific figure: On the day of German unity a pensioner in the 
former GDR got between 450 and 550 East German marks. Today he 
gets about DM1,300. This means the social situation, 
particularly that of the older generation, has improved 
enormously. We managed last year to get positions for all the 
young people who want to train for a job. I am quite sure of my 
ground, I am sticking to the flowering landscapes. I was wrong 
when I talked of four to five years. Now it might be double 
that. But let me say this: I was the one who believed in 
German unity and helped effect it, while others were 
fainthearted, and another group had long betrayed and abandoned 
the idea of German unity. 
  [Fuchs] But it is a fact of this German unity that we had 
3.9 million of unemployed in March; this is 100,000 fewer than 
in the previous month, due to seasonal improvement in the east. 
But this is still more than 16 percent unemployment. Jobs, 
jobs, jobs, an American presidential candidate entitled his 
election campaign. Could this also be an issue for you -- jobs? 
Could your message be that until October there might not be a 
lot to achieve in this respect? But what sort of timeframe do 
you envision to achieve a basic change in trends? 
  [Kohl] First, it would be lying to the voters if we said 
that unemployment could be overcome quickly. This is not 
possible anywhere. Experience has shown that when we leave a 
recession behind it takes about one year for things to 
stabilize. But -- and this is the focal point of your question 
-- I am not saying: jobs, jobs, jobs. We have to ask ourselves 
what can we do to improve our economic situation to create 
permanent jobs. It is not a matter of creating air bubbles, it 
is a matter of rethinking. Our society, our economy --and I am 
saying this without blaming anyone, we all have had our share in 
this -- we waited too long regarding a few important points over 
the past 30 years. We failed to enforce a few necessary 
reforms. Take the labor market. We waited far too long and 
accepted the fact that we have the shortest machine operating 
hours in the European Union [EU]. This means machines are 
becoming more and more expensive and they are used less and 
less. Together with the Japanese, we are the no. 1 export 
country. We have become increasingly expensive, and it cannot 
be our aim to move jobs to Hong Kong. 
  [Fuchs] Are you sticking with the label of Germany as a 
public recreation park? 
  [Kohl] No, this is not a label, and I did not say it this 
way. I said that one cannot secure a future with a public 
recreation park. This is something completely different. For 
me, the important thing now is that we must secure our future; 
we must be competitive. When I look at a European company that 
produces in Germany and in the neighboring Czech Republic, and 
workers working on the same product a few hundred kilometers 
apart earn DM3 there and DM43 here, I do not want to cut wages 
here. Wages are going up in the Czech Republic, but competition 
is at our doorstep. We must wake up now. A country that has 30 
days annual leave, plus 12-14 days of public holidays -- that 
makes eight weeks of holidays -- has to ask itself whether it 
does not have to do a bit more to secure its future. 
  [Gottlieb] Can I be somewhat more specific? At the party 
congress and afterwards you repeatedly mentioned flexibility, 
innovation, and said that the future concept must be part-time 
jobs. Is this something you want to make a central issue now? 
  [Kohl] Yes, among other things. There is no doubt about 
this. We know that in Germany there are about 2.5 million people 
who would like to have part-time jobs -- not just women, but 
also men. And there is another comparison: In the Netherlands, 
a country that can truly be compared with Germany, 34 out of 100 
jobs are part-time jobs. In Germany the percentage is 16. I 
cannot believe that the Dutch are stupider than we are. If 
people's wishes are so sensible, these jobs must be created. I 
am very pleased that my appeal has brought about positive 
reactions from employers and trade unions. We will get together 
after my return to Bonn, and we want to start a massive 
campaign. It is quite clear that I do not consider this a 
panacea. But if we can create a couple of hundred thousand 
part-time jobs, this is a great thing -- for example for young 
people. Take the situation in firms where apprentices have 
finished their training and the firm says: I no longer need you 
in this position. If they can find a solution where the 
apprentice gets a part-time job for two or three years, this 
would be a really good thing that is worth our intensive efforts. 
  [Gottlieb] But much of what you are saying is what Mr. 
Scharping is also saying. The question is to what extent the 
voter can distinguish the platforms of the two major parties on 
polling day. 
  [Kohl] I do not share this fear. The SPD is completely 
isolated internationally. If Mr. Scharping presents his views 
on Bundeswehr missions to the Socialist International he will 
only cause a general shaking of the heads. 
  [Gottlieb] We do not want to talk about the Socialist 
International. 
  [Kohl] Yes, we are talking about the elections. Let me tell 
you again, the Social Democrats have nothing to offer on an 
international level. Nothing whatsoever. In the fields of 
German unity, ostpolitik, they have always been in tow behind 
us. The same goes for western policy. In European policy they 
have not made any important new contribution. In economic 
policy.... Just compare tax policies. What are they doing now? 
It is the old socialist ideas that are dragged out again. 
  [Fuchs] According to the chairman of the medium-sized 
companies association, your solidarity surcharge is also poison 
for the economy. 
  [Kohl] This may well be the case. But I am not at all 
interested in what the chairman of the medium-sized companies 
association says. He says that on the one hand we have to cut 
public costs, and on the other hand cut taxes even further. But 
he does not tell me how I am going to balance the budget in view 
of requirements in the new laender. 
  [Fuchs] But you want the solidarity surcharge from 
everyone. [Words indistinct] 
  [Kohl] This is a completely different example. But the way 
you have put it is quite interesting. When I announced the 
introduction of the solidarity surcharge -- indicating the date 
and percentage -- at the last party conference, there were 
outcries such as: why don't you introduce it immediately? These 
voices were also coming from industry. If we had done it then, 
your first question today would have been: Was it not a grave 
mistake to introduce the solidarity surcharge so early? Back 
then I said this will be poison for the economy. It is not 
ideal for the economy now either. I know that. But I have to 
weigh things. And what I am saying now is even more important 
for the economy: I can only balance the German budget to some 
extent if I increase revenue in this situation. We cannot 
further increase debts. There is a point where we have to say 
stop, and we have reached this, and it is necessary to stabilize 
our currency. Another quite important social issue depends on 
the currency, namely the inflation rate. If we have reached 
below the 4-percent mark -- and there are quite a few people who 
say that we will have one or two months this year with average 
inflation rates of, say, 2.9 percent -- this is a No. 1 social 
achievement, as it mainly concerns lower incomes. 
  [Fuchs] Mr. Chancellor, let me pin you down more clearly. 
The solidarity surcharge for 1995 has been fixed, there is no 
doubt about that. The citizens are most allergic, most 
sensitive to discussions of taxes; they want to be told clearly 
what is going to happen. Let me ask you: Can you exclude 
further tax increases for 1995? 
  [Kohl] As regards the tax just mentioned -- of course. I 
want to have this tax, and.... 
  [Fuchs] Apart from that? 
  [Kohl] I am not saying that this can be limited timewise. I 
do not see a chance for this at the moment. How we are going to 
solve the traffic problem is a completely different question. I 
am quite consciously separating these two issues. I have not 
reached a definitive view on this issue yet. I only know that 
after 30 years we are finally privatizing the railroads, that we 
are finally getting an ecologically sensible development in 
transport by having roads and railroads parallel to each other. 
That this costs a lot of money.... I do not need to tell you; 
you have come from Munich. If you have heard the lamenting on 
the radio -- 40 km, 50 km of traffic jams -- you will know just 
as well as I do that we will have to reconsider transport 
policy. Everybody agrees on that. And I am now making a 
conscious division between general taxes and transport. As far 
as general taxes are concerned, I stick to what I said earlier. 
  [Fuchs] Mr. Chancellor, there is another controversial 
issue within the coalition: The deportation of Kurds; Kurds who 
have rioted here, if I may put it that simply. The Bavarian 
government says that anybody who does not respect his host 
country will be deported. Your justice minister says this 
deportation is against the law. What is your position? 
  [Kohl] This is not easy to say. But let me state first that 
there is no conflict in the coalition. I do not know why you 
think so. Mrs. Leutheusser has given her view. It is by no 
means certain that this is the view of the FDP. 
  [Fuchs] But she is a member of the government. 
  [Kohl] No doubt. And she does not represent the opinion of 
the Federal Government in this matter, not to mention my own. 
You want to know my opinion on the problem. We should talk 
about the problem first, then about the deportations. What has 
happened in Germany is totally unacceptable. This is not 
possible in any civilized country in the world. None at all. 
Neither in France, nor in Switzerland, nor in Great Britain 
would it be possible for people who are here as guests -- and we 
are a hospitable country, we want to remain a country that is 
friendly toward foreigners -- that these people block highways 
and cause trouble, threaten people living in the vicinity of 
their demonstrations, that police officers who do their jobs for 
us have to do so risking their lives -- this is unacceptable. I 
am not willing to bow to the terror of any group in the streets 
of Germany. And if it is Kurds who came to us with Turkish 
passports they must be aware of the consequences. We do not 
have anything at all against our Turkish friends who work here. 
But what is unacceptable is for domestic policy conflicts to be 
carried out here in our streets. 
  [Fuchs] Does this mean anybody violating our hospitality is 
to be deported? 
  [Kohl] Let me give you an example from my home: A couple of 
days ago there was this big demonstration in Mannheim. I was 
not there that day. But I am not willing to allow cities to be 
made into fortresses for demonstrations. And if there is such a 
potential of violence among the 300,000 Turkish Kurds living 
here -- there may be 3,000 to 5,000 -- they must expect the full 
force of the law to hit them. And, second, I am for deporting 
people. Third, I am for deporting people only to places -- for 
instance to Turkey -- where it is clear that the necessary 
points have been ensured from the viewpoint of human rights, 
such as protection against torture, death penalty, and all the 
rest. We do not have to discuss this. But it is unacceptable 
for our internal security and state welfare to be destroyed or 
obstructed by such forces. This is not conceivable in any 
country in the world. And I have no inhibitions about saying 
this very clearly. We will have to discuss this, also with the 
laender, whose responsibility this is. Of course, this has to 
be done observing the law. But that I am first of all thinking 
about the rights of Kurds who carry out terror scenes in our 
streets and not think about the rights of peaceloving Germans 
first -- this is a clear statement for me.... 
  [Fuchs] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Barbara </F>
Schmid in Bonn; date not given: "Kinkel: Solidarity Tax To End 
After Three Years?"] 
  [Text] There is a looming controversy in the Bonn 
coalition over tax policy. In the following interview with BILD 
AM SONNTAG, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel contradicts Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, who announced that the solidarity surcharge would 
be levied for an indefinite period of time as of 1995. 
  [Schmid] In Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] foundered on the 5-percent hurdle. Do 
you not have to fear that your party will be voted out of the 
Bundestag? 
  [Kinkel] I am sure that we will do fine in the Bundestag 
election. I think that we might achieve a double-digit result. 
  [Schmid] Why should the people vote for the FDP? 
  [Kinkel] Those who want to prevent a grand coalition or an 
alliance between the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
and the Greens must vote for the FDP. We support the 
medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the new laender, we 
fight against the hostility toward technology, and we are making 
sure that Germany will not fall into insignificance because, for 
example, gene and biotechnology research is absolutely 
neglected. Plus, we support hard work and elitist performers. 
The upper half of taxpayers provide 90 percent of total tax 
revenues. 
  [Schmid] The tax burden will increase next year as a result 
of the solidarity surcharge.... 
  [Kinkel] We must take some burden off the people who are 
filling the coffers. This is why, in my opinion, we should 
reexamine after three years whether the solidarity surcharge 
should still be necessary. 
  [Schmid] What is the FDP's view on a 130 km/h speed limit 
for highways? 
  [Kinkel] We are against general speed limits. One must not 
take the pleasure of driving away from people. There is no 
point in reducing the speed on the few kilometers of highway 
that do not have a speed limit yet. I also enjoy driving, and 
sometimes I like to drive fast, too. Besides, I am also in 
favor of keeping the legal blood alcohol limit of 0.8 per 
milliliter. 
  [Schmid] There will be a lack of 8 billion German marks [DM] 
to finance the debts of the federal railroads as of 1996. Will 
the gasoline tax be increased? 
  [Kinkel] Increasing the gasoline tax would be poison for the 
economy. I am against it. 
  [Schmid] Why is the FDP making so much fuss about a 
coalition statement? 
  [Kinkel] We will make this decision at the party congress in 
Rostock in early June, where we will also outline the future 
course of the FDP. 
  [Schmid] Friends within your party, such as Juergen 
Moellemann, have accused you of being too close with the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and have called for 
confrontation with Kohl. 
  [Kinkel] In difficult times we have done very good work in 
the coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]. The 
voters do not appreciate if somebody suddenly begins to 
hysterically dance on the table before the election. I am for 
efficient work and against show performances. We will very 
clearly emphasize the differences between us and the CDU/CSU. 
We are calling for double citizenship, for example, for an 
immigration control law, and less rigid guidelines for 
naturalization. We must quickly reconstruct our social system 
because otherwise it will strangle us. Still, nobody will be 
stripped of justified social benefits. We also have to make it 
clear to the people that the percentage of elderly people in the 
German population is constantly increasing -- in the year 2000, 
25 percent will be 60 and older -- and that fewer and fewer 
children are being born. This means that we have to think about 
the treaties between the generations, because a shrinking number 
of young people has to take care of an increasing number of 
elderly. 
  [Schmid] Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has 
said that criminal Kurds must not be deported. FDP legal expert 
Burkhard Hirsch and FDP Vice Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt are in 
favor of deportation. So what is the FDP's position on this 
issue? 
  [Kinkel] Several hundreds of thousands of Kurds enjoy the 
right to be guests in Germany and have to behave accordingly. 
Those who incur a penalty here must be taken to court and 
prison. Under our law and under the circumstances, deportation 
is only possible in absolutely exceptional cases. It has to 
ensured that he who is deported is not threatened with torture, 
the death penalty, or any treatment that is inconsistent with 
the principles of the law-governed state. Within the Federal 
Government we are examining whether this can be or is guaranteed 
on the basis of a treaty or agreement. The justice minister 
said nothing else. 
  [Schmid] The Turkish Government has signed international 
agreements; nevertheless, people are tortured there. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, unfortunately violations of human rights do 
exist in Turkey. Now as then there are reports of torture in 
police prisons. It is particularly because we have had friendly 
ties with Turkey for decades, because it is our partner in NATO 
and has an important bridging function, that the protection of 
human rights has to be called for openly. This is what I have 
done and what I will continue to do. The last time I did it was 
the day before yesterday in a long telephone conversation with 
the Turkish foreign minister, who, by the way, is a Kurd himself.

does not plan to ban the right-wing extremist Republikaner. He 
does not think that an application for a ban to the Federal 
Constitutional Court would have a chance. The material that the

so far is not sufficient for a ban, Kanther said. Instead, he 
recommended struggling against the Repulikaner with political

<F P=106> [Michael J. Inacker report: "Bonn Plans To Reduce </F>
Compulsory Military Service to 10 Months"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The FRG Defense Ministry is planning 
new, basic changes in the size and structure of the Bundeswehr 
and also the duration of military service. Framework conditions 
are currently being worked out. 
  Even though the Federal Government wants to avoid committing 
itself to exact figures at the moment, according to information 
obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, a reduction of the "present 
strength" has already been decided: The overall strength of the 
German armed forces of 370,000 men, which was set down by the 
two-plus-four treaty, is to be reduced to 320,000 to 340,000 
soldiers during the second half of the 1990's. At the same 
time, compulsory military service is to be reduced from 12 to 10 
months. 
  These targets are to be examined as part of the 
"conceptional 
guidelines" -- that is, the future structural and framework data 
-- for the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], wants to present these guidelines to the 
public at the end of April. 
  With these guidelines, the Defense Ministry wants to react 
to 
the drastically reduced defense budget and, at the same time, 
take into account that -- according to internal calculations by 
the Ministry -- as of 1996 there will be a deficit of 30,000 to 
40,000 men eligible for military service for maintaining the 
intended Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men. In addition, the 
reductions are to bring about savings, with which the investment 
share in the defense budget, which has been considerably reduced 
over recent years, can be increased once again. 
  According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, 
Defense 
Minister Ruehe plans to explain the details at a meeting behind 
closed doors of the Defense Working Group of the CDU/Christian 
Social Union Bundestag Group in Siegen on 24-25 April. One day 
later defense politicians of the coalition partner, the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany, are to be briefed on the matter. 
The official presentation of the "conceptional guidelines" in 
the Bundestag is planned for 28 April. It is still unclear 
whether this will be done in the form of a government statement 
with the participation of the chancellor or, for the time being, 
as a briefing of the Bundestag Defense Committee. [passage

<F P=106> ["Stue"-signed report: "More Orders for West German </F>
Industry"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 7 Apr -- Orders in the west German processing 
industries saw a marked increase in February. The Economics 
Ministry reports a real and seasonally adjusted increase of 3 
percent over the previous month. Domestic orders were up 2.5 
percent, while export orders increased 4 percent. With a 
4-percent increase, the investment goods industry was in the 
lead. Within the investment goods sector, the car industry even 
achieved a 9-percent growth. Orders also went up in the primary 
and producer goods industries (+ 2.5 percent) and in the 
consumer goods industry (+ 2 percent). 
  Comparing January/February 1994 with November/December 1993, 
orders in the west German processing industries show a 
1.5-percent increase. This is due to a 3.5-percent growth in 
foreign orders. Domestic orders remained unchanged. Only 
producers of investment goods had to face a slight 0.5-percent 
decline. The primary and producer goods industries went up 3.5 
percent. Orders in the consumer goods industry increased 3 
percent. The January and February 1994 orders in west German 
industry were up 2.3 percent over last year. This growth was 
also due to a strong increase in exports.

<F P=106> ["evo"-signed report: "Loss of Jobs Continues at Same Rate"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- The Berlin-based German Economic 
Research Institute [DIW] expects a significant increase in the 
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at the end of 1994. At 
the same time, workers' purchasing power will further decline. 
  The loss of jobs in west German manufacturing, mining, and 
energy is expected to continue at the same rate as in the 
previous quarter, according to the latest DIW weekly bulletin. 
The moderate collective agreement settlements do potentially 
mean that the cost burden on companies will be reduced, but they 
will also have a negative impact on domestic sales. If and when 
a reduction in costs is really to occur remains an open question. 
  In western Germany, employment continued to fall in the 
fourth quarter of 1993. According to the DIW, the seasonally 
adjusted unemployment rate rose by 100,000 (120,000 in the third 
quarter). That means that the average unemployment rate in 1993 
amounted to 7.4 percent. Compared to the final quarter of 1992, 
the number of unemployed fell by 2.4 percent or 614,000 to 25.5 
million. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the seasonally adjusted 
number of job vacancies fell by 8 percent to 217,000. 
  During the second half of 1993, the east German labor market 
stabilized at a lower level. According to the DIW, the 
unemployment rate of 15.3 percent (13.8 percent in the second 
half of the year) makes the situation appear to be better than 
it actually is, because a increasing number of employees are 
losing their entitlements to fringe benefits. On an annual 
average basis, the number of part-time employees in the new 
laender has been halved compared to 1992 and stands at 181,000. 
Job vacancies rose slightly in 1993 to 36,000 (33,000 in 1992). 
  There was a massive reduction in the number of jobs in west 
German industry in 1993. In the construction industry, the 
level of employment remained static, and in the services sector, 
the number of jobs compared to 1992 rose by almost 160,000. In 
the final quarter of 1993, manufacturing industry shed 140,000 
employees (175,000 in the third quarter). The capital goods 
sector registered the largest loss of jobs compared to the 
previous quarter, one of 2.1 percent. Altogether, the number of 
jobs in manufacturing industry fell by almost 500,000 in 1993. 
  In the final quarter of 1993, the average income of the 
employed in the old laender rose by 2.7 percent to 4,575 German 
marks [DM]. In view of the reduction in the number of jobs, 
gross wages and salaries only rose by 0.2 percent to DM350 
billion. Whereas unit labor costs in the economy as a whole did 
not rise as sharply in the second half of the year as in the 
first half, those in manufacturing actually fell by 1.7 percent 
in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year before. 
  Employment trends in eastern Germany did not change during 
the quarter covered by the report. In the case of job losses in 
manufacturing, those affected were mainly part-time workers, 
while the number of those in full-time employment remained 
static. On the other hand, in the case of the production of 
materials and industrial goods, which particularly profited from 
the expansion of the construction industry, the number of people 
in full-time employment rose significantly compared to the 
previous year. In the case of capital goods, there was a slight 
improvement in the second half of the year. There was a 
moderate rise in employment in the tertiary sector. 
  Compared to the previous year, gross wages and salaries rose 
by 5.7 percent, to DM53 billion, during the period covered by 
the report. This corresponds to an increase in the average 
income of employed persons of 9 percent, to DM3,125. There was a 
particularly sharp increase in the incomes of employees in the 
materials and industrial goods sectors (one of 16 percent to 
DM3,045), but they are only 51 percent of the west German level. 
In the new laender, the average annual increase in unit labor 
costs in the economy as a whole was only 2.1 percent as a result 
of modest upward adjustments in wages and salaries.

<F P=106> ["AX"-signed report: "Diepgen Content With His Visit to </F>
China So Far"] 
  [Text] Beijing/Berlin -- In an interim stocktaking of his 
visit to China, Berlin's Mayor Eberhard Diepgen was very 
positive. His wish to expand economic relations has met with 
"great interest" and "great openness," Diepgen told journalists 
yesterday. It is important that German exports to China are 
increased and that the Berlin area gets a bigger share in this. 
Businessmen accompanying him were also content with the results 
achieved so far. 
  In securing orders from China, transport and environment 
policies play a special role, Diepgen said. Also, old contacts 
established during the GDR era should be used and given a 
central role. 
  The new partnership agreement between the German capital and 
Beijing will apply to contacts in the fields of culture and 
science, as well as industry, such as joint activities at trade 
fairs. Furthermore, it has been agreed that contact persons 
shall be appointed to organize companies' activities. 
  Asked whether he has voiced concern about the arrest of 
dissidents -- including the most prominent human rights activist 
Wei Jingsheng -- either personally or on behalf of the Federal 
Government, Diepgen said he had addressed "all issues" that are 
relevant between the FRG and China, "including human rights." 
He did, however, not say what form this had taken. Diepgen 
will travel to Shanghai today; from there he will go on to the 
special economic area of Shenzhen.

<F P=106> ["ps."-signed report: "Number of Unemployed Falls Under 4 </F>
Million; Jagoda Says `Traditional Spring Recovery' Responsible"] 
  [Text] Nuremberg -- Bernhard Jagoda, president of the 
Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg, has attributed the slight 
decrease in the number of unemployed to under 4 million 
(3,900,416) for the entire federal territory mainly to seasonal 
reasons. Particularly in western Germany, the "traditional 
spring recovery" has now only covered the continuing economic 
and structural tensions on the labor market. "Seasonally 
adjusted," unemployment in the old FRG territory increased by 
another 20,000. Compared to last year, the number of unemployed 
is 416,600 higher. Jagoda said that the demand for labor was 
weak in the west. In the new laender, however, there has been a 
strong increase in job offers. 
  Employment continues to show a downward trend in western 
Germany. According to provisional figures provided by the 
Federal Statistical Office, a total of 28.46 million were 
gainfully employed in February. This is 580,000 fewer than in 
1993. The trend is also reflected in the statistics of labor 
offices. At the end of March, 247,500 vacancies were registered 
in the west, 7 percent less than one year ago. According to the 
Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Office, this comparison appears to 
be more favorable as a result of the recent strong increase in 
reported demand of seasonal labor in the agricultural and 
catering sector. Without these figures, the number of vacancies 
in the first quarter of 1994 was almost 20 percent below last 
year's level. However, less than half of the demand of new 
labor is even reported to the labor offices. 
  In Nuremberg, the entire offer of vacancies is estimated to 
be the average of the fourth quarter of 1993 -- 536,000. This 
was one-third less than in the same period of 1992. Since the 
share of new jobs planned to be offered in the long term also 
decreased significantly as of late, enterprises are expected to 
be relatively reluctant to employ new people in the first half 
year of 1994, Jagoda said. The decrease in demand includes more 
and more smaller enterprises. There has, however, been a 
sizable reduction in short-time work, particularly in the key 
areas such as the automotive and machine construction industry. 
  A different development was registered by labor offices in 
eastern Germany. There, short-time work is stagnating at a 
level of about 135,000 employees. Yet, the influence of 
intervention in terms of labor policy is on the whole 
diminishing. Only the so-called job-creating measures were 
still increasing in March. A total of 238,175 east Germans are 
currently working in fully subsidized jobs. The number of 
participants in further training classes and retraining schemes 
is, however, continually decreasing. More and more of those 
people on early retirement schemes are receiving normal pensions 
as they get older. Including the people on short-time work, the 
unemployment statistics for the new laender does not include 1.2 
million people who would appear in the statistic without some 
kind of benefits. One year ago, this number was 500,000 higher. 
  In the view of the Federal Labor Office, the demand for 
labor 
in the new laender is clearly superior to the approximately 
76,000 vacancies that were registered at the labor offices in 
March. It is mainly smaller companies that are creating the 
demand, with trends even increasing. The Federal Office, 
however, has noted growing reticence among enterprises to 
contact the labor office for their search for new employees. 
The quota of registered vacancies was 24 percent for the fourth 
quarter 1993, while in western Germany it is 37 percent. "We 
do not regard that as an image problem but many managers in 
enterprises in the new laender obviously still fail to 
understand that we are able to offer people with excellent 
qualifications," Jagoda said. Thus, communication in the new 
laender must be extended quickly. The growing demand for labor 
there is regarded by Jagoda as a clear sign for "tendencies 
toward economic stabilization and stimulation" in eastern 
Germany. 
  According to Michael Glos, head of the Christian Social 
Union 
group in the Bundestag, the decrease in the number of unemployed 
justifies the hope for a turn of the tide. In a statement, the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has meanwhile noted 
that the new figures cannot conceal that the situation is as 
serious as before.

<F P=106> [Udo Kreikemeier commentary: "Victory for Free Trade"] </F>
  [Text] The dispute about the social clauses will not 
prevent the signing of the treaty on the founding of a World 
Trade Organization (WTO). The 120 member states of GATT will 
finally be able to end the talks on the Uruguay Round that 
lasted for several years. 
  The United States has not succeeded in ensuring the 
inclusion 
of standards for the rights of employees. No matter how 
important topics like minimum wages and child labor are in 
developing countries -- they must not prevent the signing of an 
agreement at the last minute that at least curbs protectionism. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Germany should have thought 
about that before demanding that Bonn not sign a WTO treaty 
without clauses on the rights of employees. French farmers, 
European film lobbyists, and others have long enough been trying 
to prevent the signing. According to GATT calculations, the 
agreement will result in an increase in world trade by $750 
billion within 10 years, which is a 12-percent increase. Those 
who want prosperity must not give away this potential carelessly 
-- let alone because of the topic "social issues in the Third 
World." This is a very sensitive problem. Developing countries 
usually reject interference in their own affairs. Thus, serious 
negotiations and not hastily formulated commonplaces are 
required.

<F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "GATT Sets Noble Goals for </F>
Itself"] 
  [Text] When the government representatives of the 120 
partner states of GATT meet, discussions are often heated. On 
15 December they celebrated the success of their seven years of 
negotiations about new free trade rules, which was hardly 
considered still possible. Exactly four months later, next 
Friday [15 April], they want to sign the new 550-page treaty in 
Marrakesh, Morocco. However, it was just last Friday that the 
danger was averted that they would quarrel for days before the 
final celebration, as if the agreement of mid-December had not 
been achieved at all. 
  In the hectic negotiations of the past days in Geneva, 
nothing less was the issue than a decision on political 
direction. At the beginning of next year, GATT, which is only 
an agreement, as its name implies, will turn into the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), which will have far more powers. The 
WTO will not only have more power, granted to it by the treaty, 
to implement the new free trade regulations. As Brussels 
Foreign Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan says, it will 
"probably also develop into the decisive forum of international 
discussion about all economic problems," some sort of 
international security council for international economic 
policy. The supporting pillars of international economic and 
trade relations include -- and this is something that the 
industrial West agrees on in principle -- human rights, 
environmental protection, and a minimum of decent work 
conditions. GATT Secretary General Peter Sutherland is 
currently having the text of the apolitical statement polished, 
which is solemnly to order the WTO to work out comprehensive 
economic policy rules of behavior. 
  In the meantime, the United States and France are racing 
ahead in an unusual alliance. In Marrakesh they want to set 
down that the validity of the newly adopted free trade 
regulations depends on the preservation of future social and 
environmental standards. This enrages the GATT majority of the 
Third World, because they fear protectionism by the West against 
them, which might enter through the back door. The United 
States and the French want to be able to close off access to the 
markets for products that, for instance, have been produced by 
children or prisoners or are kept cheap through extremely low 
wages. They argue that there cannot be any free markets for 
dangerous waste or for products that have the ozone-killing 
chlorofluorocarbons as an ingredient, or for deals that 
eradicate species of fauna. The Third World does not 
fundamentally oppose such principles, but it wants to talk about 
it and not have it hang like the sword of Damocles over its 
exports from the outset. 
  In the European Union the majority are willing to give the 
developing countries and, above all, the emerging industrialized 
countries in Asia every guarantee that the minimum regulation of 
environmental protection and decent working conditions, which 
are included in GATT, will not provide an excuse for 
protectionism. However, France and the United States are drawing 
a line of tolerance. The French have always believed that their 
ideas about fair foreign trade can be better implemented through 
a network of bilateral agreements than through the classical 
multilateral free trade rules of GATT, and the current Clinton 
Administration in Washington is most profoundly convinced of 
that. After all, the United States has its experiences with 
Japan, and the French can point to the single market. 
Basically, what is important for them is the command of 
reciprocity. 
  Countries open their markets only for those that also do so, 
and they let competition between them have free reign only if 
they compete with relatively similar costs. On the single 
market reciprocity has been implemented virtually 100 percent. 
Thus, the member states of the European Union are in free 
competition with one another and, therefore, there is no 
resistance to the single market. GATT, however, is far from that. 
  However, this will not last long. The WTO is to build a 
bridge between the followers of bilateral "managed trade" and 
those of worldwide free markets. It is to link the classical 
"free trade" with "fair trade." Therefore, it must be equipped 
with instruments, at least rudimentarily, which the United 
States and the European Union have; otherwise the two economic 
powers would not renounce the use of their own instruments. 
This is the philosophy behind the WTO's mechanisms for settling 
quarrels, to which every member state has to subordinate itself 
in the future, just as, in addition, to the Ministers' 
Conference, which meets every two years and can adopt decisions 
with a three-quarter majority. Thus, the WTO is modeled a 
little along the lines of the Council of Ministers in Brussels, 
and this is what France likes. The United States, on the other 
hand, would not have given up its "Super 301," if all the 
partner states in GATT were not committed to adjusting their 
laws to the Geneva regulations. The "Section 301" in U.S. trade 
law serves the purpose of threatening other countries with 
import quotas if they do not open their markets. As of 1995 the 
WTO will take over its task of enforcing reciprocity. At the 
moment the European Union can still ignore the Geneva free trade 
rules and enforce its banana market order, which is against the 
rules. As of next year, it will not be able to. 
  When the Uruguay Round began in 1986, no one was thinking of 
the WTO. When has it ever been the case that international 
politics achieved more than it intended?

<F P=106> [Peter Sturm editorial: "Saber Rattling in Pyongyang"] </F>
  [Text] Time seems to have stopped on the Korean Peninsula. 
The communist state in the north [DPRK] has isolated itself from 
the outside world and is playing cat and mouse with it on the 
nuclear issue. North Korea has again refused to give inspectors 
of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] access to a 
nuclear facility where nuclear weapons are allegedly being 
developed. In addition, the regime in Pyongyang is spreading 
slogans that are supposed to suggest that war is imminent. Even 
though similar things were heard a year ago, this does not 
necessarily permit the conclusion that this time, too, 
everything will end peacefully. 
  In South Korea [ROK], reaction to the tension produced by 
the 
north is rather calm, but concern is not hidden. Seoul cannot 
be interested in an armed conflict with the north because it is 
just on the point of becoming a developed industrial state. In 
addition, the capital city, with its 10 million inhabitants, is 
only a few kilometers away from the demarcation line. While 
South Korea relies on "persuading" the north, the United States 
is demonstrating firmness. Washington has initiated the 
deployment of antiaircraft missiles in South Korea. One also 
speaks of a potential reinforcement of troops. The joint 
U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers, which are now to be held 
after all, are to be seen as a means of symbolic pressure. All 
this, however, should not give rise to the assumption that the 
United States is determined to engage in a war, if necessary. 
  Experiences from other areas of the world can be transposed 
only to a limited extent. If, however, a state is like the 
Stalinist-Communist North Korea, one may conclude that it is not 
consolidated internally. This is not changed by the militant 
rhetoric that is used by the regime toward the outside. In the 
view of the Asian neighbors, this rather shows a rising degree 
of weakness. 
  Not least thanks to its growing economic capacity, South 
Korea, on the other hand, has managed to establish normal 
relations with all real and potential allies of Pyongyang in the 
region. Even though China is opposing sanctions, its support 
for North Korea seems rather half-hearted. The countries in 
Indochina are paying tribute to the alleged ideals of Socialism 
only as a justification of their rule, but they are hardly 
interested in cooperation with North Korea anymore. 
  Nevertheless, the saber rattling of the rulers in Pyongyang 
has directed general attention to the relations of military 
power in Korea. It turns out that the north has more weapons 
than the south in practically all categories. However, what do 
such figures tell? Since Stalin's time at the latest, it had 
been part of the Soviet Union's military doctrine to have as 
much as possible of everything. Not only in this respect does 
"Great Leader" Kim Il-song prove to be an eager pupil of the 
former Soviet despot. The only thing that would be illuminating 
would be a comparison of the fighting power of the armed forces 
of North Korea and those of South Korea, which will, however, 
hardly be possible because of North Korea's isolation. 
  History knows many examples of dictators, whose arms quickly 
dissolved as a result of pressure from the outside. From the 
viewpoint of the regime in Pyongyang, a military conflict, which 
no one can want, would mean a weakening of the -- at least 
partly -- self-chosen isolation, but probably also the end of 
Communist rule as such. Kim Il-song's power is, not least, 
based on isolating his subjects from all information coming from 
the "hostile" surroundings. For this purpose, Kim is 
cultivating a unique personality cult. He likes to present 
himself as the great resistance fighter against the former 
colonial power Japan, knowing that this is well-received by 
patriotic Koreans in the north and the south. However, the 
scarce information that is available on this topic says that 
Kim's "achievements" in the anti-Japanese resistance fight were 
rather modest. If his fellow citizens were deprived of that 
illusion, too, the foundation of the regime would be even worse 
off. How important such myths for totalitarian states are is 
shown by looking at the history of the Soviet Union. The rule 
of the CPSU [Communist party of the Soviet Union] would probably 
have collapsed much earlier, if the bolshevik leadership could 
not have written the victory in World War II on its flag. 
  If the government in Pyongyang acted at least half-way 
reasonably, it would have to do everything to avoid a war. 
However, it is difficult to rely on that, given a regime whose 
representatives have become prisoners of their own propaganda. 
Nevertheless, the militant drumming in North Korea should be 
received with a certain measure of skepticism. Prudent action, 
which avoids unnecessary provocation, should be the common 
guideline for the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea. 
Perhaps North Korea would indeed be more accessible, as it has 
repeatedly indicated, if it were finally recognized by 
Washington. 
  Crises often reach a point where there does not seem to be 
any way back. However, at the moment one cannot yet speak of an 
unavoidable military conflict with North Korea. There is still 
the hope that coordinated international pressure will bring the 
rulers in Pyongyang to their senses.

  [Excerpts] The situation in Bosnia: things are somewhat 
calmer this evening in Gorazde. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this evening that the 
allies would not retreat when faced with provocations or attacks 
in Bosnia, wherever they came from. Alain Juppe spoke to Alain 
Pages of Radio France Bordeaux-Gironde: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] The resolutions of the Security 
Council and the decisions of the alliance are very clear: they 
authorize UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] to ask for the use of 
air strikes when it believes that our soldiers on the ground are 
under threat. These conditions were fulfilled in Gorazde. 
  If the conditions that occurred in Gorazde should, alas, 
happen again, if UNPROFOR is attacked, if one side or another, 
let us say the Serbs, do not respect the decisions taken by the 
United Nations, then of course air strikes must be used. We 
must make it clear that we shall not retreat when faced with 
provocations and attacks. [end recording]

  [Text] In Bosnia, the situation appears to be quieter in 
the region of Gorazde following yesterday's second NATO air 
strike on Serb tanks shelling the Muslim enclave. Bosnians 
welcome this show of force. 
  Alain Lamassoure, the French minister delegate of European 
affairs said this morning [on Radio Monte Carlo] that the 
bombing of Serb positions should be extended if the latter were 
to continue their attacks on the Gorazde safe haven. The carrot 
and the stick must be used, Lamassoure added.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Juppe. 
  [Juppe] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] You are the key person behind three issues in the 
news in the last few hours: Edouard Balladur's visit to China, 
NATO air strikes in Gorazde, and chaos in Rwanda against the 
background of tribal war. I would like you to give us details 
on these issues, preferably without any stereotypes. Let's 
start with the visit to China. According to today's newspapers, 
this was not a great success, this was a failure. Are you 
satisfied? 
  [Juppe] We achieved our goal. What was our goal? It was not 
to establish democracy in China within three days. It was not 
to sign contracts, as I have read in some newspapers. Our goal 
was to reestablish a political dialogue with China. What was 
the situation when we came to office last year? China and 
France were not on speaking terms. I will even reveal a detail, 
since you do not want stereotypes: Our ambassador was unable to 
meet Chinese ministers, either in their ministries or in the 
French Embassy. There was no dialogue at all. Can you imagine 
France not communicating with China? 
  [Giesbert] The dialogue was difficult. You ducked the issue 
of human rights. 
  [Juppe] Not at all. We did not duck the issue. France 
outlined what its concept of human rights was in talks between 
the two prime ministers and the two foreign ministers and it 
explained why it considers the human rights situation in China 
to be unsatisfactory. 
  [Giesbert] Dissidents were freed as soon as Edouard Balladur 
left China. 
  [Juppe] I must tell you that I am quite amazed by this way 
of 
presenting things; I was there, things were slightly different. 
When we arrived in Shanghai, we saw press agency reports 
indicating that one or two dissidents had been questioned, not 
arrested, but questioned. We immediately demanded explanations 
-- I did so myself by summoning the Chinese ambassador to my 
office -- and we said that we demanded to know what the real 
situation was. The accompanying Chinese minister, commiting the 
Chinese government, solemnly told us that these arrests had not 
taken place. The Chinese press agency confirmed this 
information the day after our arrival. When I hear today that 
they were freed the day after we had left, I say there has been 
disinformation somewhere. 
  [Giesbert] Are you saying that there were false reports 
somewhere? 
  [Juppe] There was disinformation somewhere. What I can say 
is that we were perfectly clear -- I said so myself to my 
interlocutors -- we came to talk, it is normal, it is necessary 
for France and China to talk to each other; however, we do not 
agree on a certain number of issues and we clearly explained 
which ones. 
  [Giesbert] We noticed a different emphasis between the prime 
minister and yourself. You were firm, extremely firm, and 
Edouard Balladur said that this issue of human rights should be 
settled, I quote, with discretion. 
  [Juppe] I believe that distance is a distortion. I was with 
Edouard Balladur and I did not feel the slightest difference 
between our respective positions. 
  [Giesbert] In an article published in LE JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE 
Bernard Kouchner reproached Edouard Balladur for having given in 
to the Chinese leaders. He spoke of a policy of silence and 
blindness, he blamed you for sacrificing human rights for trade, 
a state trade paid for by the French taxpayers. I was quoting 
Bernard Kouchner. 
  [Juppe] Mr. Kouchner was doing his job -- this time rather 
poorly and in a sectarian manner -- he is in the opposition. He 
preferred to kneel down in front of CNN cameras with a sack of 
rice on his shoulders, this period is over now. 
  [Giesbert] Some weeks ago French diplomacy made a rather 
grand gesture toward China by abandoning -- so the rumor went -- 
Taiwan. Following your return from China, do you have the 
feeling that you have been paid back? 
  [Juppe] This comparison is interesting. We are being told: 
Moral values are at stake, we should not have spoken to China, 
we should have stuck with Taiwan. What was the moral stand 
concerning Taiwan when Mr. Joxe was in office? It was to sell 
Mirage aircraft and frigates. I cannot understand. We did not 
break with Taiwan, we simply told Taiwan that we would honor our 
commitments, whatever the cost. In the future, we will try to 
show a certain restraint concerning arms sales to Taiwan. We 
are ready to continue our cooperation with Taiwan and we will do 
so. Meanwhile, we have quite a lot of things to do in China. 
Do you realize that this country with a population of 1.2 
billion has an annual growth rate of 13 percent? It needs 
telephone lines, nuclear power plants, high-speed trains, it 
needs wheat, it is currently importing wheat. These are issues 
on which we have been working. This will take time because it 
is not the government which decides, but firms which are 
negotiating. It is with this in mind that we resumed the 
dialogue. 
  Let me say that I would like to place this visit to China 
alongside the visits I made to India and Japan. These three 
countries of the world, rather distant from each other, include 
nearly half the world's population. I noted that France had 
been absent from these countries for five to six years; there 
was no visit by ministers, no real political dialogue, no 
commercial ambition. I am being a bit unfair because, 
fortunately, there are French firms working there. Can we have 
a foreign policy while being absent from a region like this? I 
believe that this was the meaning of my visit, too, and I wanted 
to stress this. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, let's now talk about Bosnia. We do 
not really understand what happened in Gorazde yesterday when 
two American planes bombed Serb positions. Was it to protect UN 
soldiers or to prevent Serbs overrunning Gorazde? 
  [Juppe] Both. Gorazde is a safe haven, I will not repeat 
what this means. The United Nations has decided that a certain 
number of zones in Bosnia should be specially protected. I 
believe that we waited for slightly too long; I am delighted 
that we eventually strongly intervened to put on the brake. 
However we must now know what the future holds. 
  [Giesbert] Is this really aimed at putting a brake on? Isn't 
it rather a pinprick? 
  [Juppe] Listen, bombings are never a pinprick. A turning 
point was reached about a month ago with the ultimatum in 
Sarajevo. At the time I said that all this should be part of a 
political and diplomatic plan. What worries me -- besides the 
situation on the ground, obviously -- is that the diplomatic 
process is currently at a virtual standstill. There are talks 
with the Muslims and the Croats on one side; contacts with the 
Serbs have not really resumed yet. What I am asking -- and this 
is rather urgent now -- is to include all these diplomatic 
initiatives into a coherent framework. There is only one such 
plan now, which is the European Union action plan, which makes 
provisions for the sharing of territory between the various 
communities, for lifting sanctions as soon as the Serbs commit 
themselves to peace. I invite all parties -- including the 
Serbs, obviously -- to resume talks on this basis. 
  [Giesbert] Does this mean that you are launching a new Juppe 
initiative? 
  [Juppe] This is not a new initiative. I am reasserting a 
conviction that I have been defending for months. We made a 
significant step forward on the ground by demonstrating our 
will, our resolution and our strength. This should not lead us 
to forget that the one and only possible solution is a 
negotiated settlement. 
  [Giesbert] Do you believe that the United Nations is capable 
of imposing a cease-fire in Gorazde today? 
  [Juppe] I know that steps in that direction have been taken 
and that UN Protection Force officials and a certain number of 
diplomats are trying to get the Bosnian Serb leader, Karadzic, 
and leading Bosnian Muslim officials together so as to resume 
talks. 
  [Giesbert] The Bosnian Muslims are saying, this is too late 
now. This is what the Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic, 
said yesterday. 
  [Juppe] Let me stress that it is never too late and that 
such 
words are unacceptable. 
  [Giesbert] We had the feeling yesterday that the Americans 
were ruling the roost; was that the case? 
  [Juppe] No it was a decision by the Atlantic alliance, 
following a request from the UN secretariat general in the 
framework of an operation in which we are full participants. 
These planes could have been French, French planes are part of 
the Alliance forces. 
  [Giesbert] Let's now discuss the situation in Rwanda, where 
it is the Americans who are absent. We have reports of 
appalling ethnic massacres: Hutus are hunting down Tutsis 
throughout the country and the other way round. 
  [Juppe] We just have to watch pictures to understand that 
there are no limits to horror. As you know France has been 
deeply involved in Rwanda in the past few months in attempts to 
restore peace. 
  [Giesbert] Not very successfully, it seems. 
  [Juppe] We did get results: The Arusha agreements were 
signed, French soldiers were on the scene to help in the 
reconciliation process, and things were moving forward. 
Unfortunately the attack on the plane transporting the 
presidents of Burundi and Rwanda provoked a resumption of the 
fighting. We decided very rapidly, very calmly, and very 
efficiently to set up a plan of action at Kigali airport to 
evacuate our nationals, this has now been nearly achieved. 
  [Giesbert] Some 60 are still there, are you optimistic about 
the evacuation of these last remaining French nationals? 
  [Juppe] We will evacuate them today. 
  [Giesbert] When we see what is going on, do you believe 
France should maintain a presence in Rwanda, in Burundi? 
  [Juppe] We cannot abandon our nationals and I believe that 
it 
is our duty to help the resumption of dialogue. This seems 
impossible when you see what is going on, the level of hatred 
between Hutus and Tutsis, but the Arusha agreements were signed 
and France's role is to attempt everything possible, with the 
neighboring countries, with the OAU, with the United Nations, to 
see reason prevail over the currently raging madness. This is 
our role. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Snub"] </F>
  [Text] Paris -- How many Western politicians have headed to 
Beijing with a smile on their lips and their minds filled with 
dreams of securing various contracts, only to meet with a rude 
awakening when faced with the harsh realities of Chinese 
realpolitik? Mr. Balladur is currently going through the same 
unpleasant experience. The leaders of the Forbidden City are 
past masters in the art of the snub, of contempt, provocation or 
-- even better -- a lack of conscience in international 
relations. 
  Faced with leaders for whom foreign policy is no "gala 
dinner" but rests essentially on a relationship based on a power 
struggle, diplomatic subtleties barely count for anything. Nor 
is it merely a question of generously smiling, bowing and 
scraping, and making concessions in the hope of being paid back 
in return. It is more effective to gain respect by maintaining 
a coherent attitude that is firm when required, flexible when 
necessary, and -- above all -- by knowing one's dossiers inside 
out. 
  It was obvious to anyone with even the slightest knowledge 
of 
China that Mr. Balladur was going to run up against the wall of 
human rights. The U.S. foreign secretary underwent the same 
bitter experience only recently. And yet this experience does 
not appear to have been in vain. New dissidents have been put 
behind bars, forcing the French prime minister, who had hoped -- 
wrongly as it turns out -- to limit the debate to a few 
generally worded formulations, to devote a large proportion of 
his time to that subject, at the expense of laying the 
groundwork for the "major contracts" so dearly sought following 
the normalization of relations last January. 
  China has also placed Mr. Balladur in an untenable position 
in France, where both his "friends" and the opposition were 
awaiting his return without a kind word to say to him. Anyway, 
by publishing an interview with Jacques Chirac in THE PEOPLE'S 
DAILY NEWS one day after his arrival, Beijing clearly showed 
which candidate it is supporting for the presidential election 
in 1995. And it is not Mr. Balladur. 
  China, that major new superpower and product of a new 
economic miracle, might have been expected to behave responsibly 
-- both in the international arena and at home, where the notion 
of freedoms that it defends is only distantly related to the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The remarks made by one 
Chinese official regarding the individuals NEWSWEEK had reported 
as being condemned to death are enough to send a cold shiver 
down anyone's spine: "If the families do not claim their 
bodies, we will use them as fertilizer." 
  However, diplomacy is merely the art of doing what is 
possible. And it might have been hoped that the visit by Mr. 
Balladur would take greater account of Chinese reality as it 
actually is, and less account of a China idealized by its 
sycophants and certain businessmen.

  [Text] Bordeaux, France, April 11 (AFP) -- A bomb alert 
that turned out to be a false alarm was reported Monday [11 
April] on a commercial jet carrying French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe, airline officials said. 
  The French domestic airline Air Inter said the Airbus 300 
carrying 306 people was halfway between Paris and Bordeaux when 
an anonymous caller to Paris' Orly airport said there was a bomb 
on board. 
  The pilot decided to continue the flight, and all the 
passengers were evacuated as soon as the jet landed in Bordeaux 
in southwest France. 
  A search of the aircraft turned up no bomb. 
  Juppe was traveling to Bordeaux to inaugurate an 
organization 
designed to boost trade between regional companies and 
international firms.

Committee"] 
  [Text] Jacques Chirac returned to his seat on the 
Parliamentary Defense Committee, which he has belonged to since 
the start of this legislative term but which he recently left to 
join the Cultural, Social, and Family Affairs Committee. The 
return of the Rally for the Republic [RPR] deputy for the 
Correze region to the Defense Committee -- which is chaired by 
Jacques Boyon (RPR, Ain) -- comes at a time when Parliament is 
getting ready to examine the draft military planning law for 
1995-2000. 
  After being submitted to the president of the Republic at 
the 
last meeting of the Defense Council on Wednesday 6 April, the 
document is currently at the State Council stage. It will then 
be presented to cabinet on 20 April before being publicly 
debated in the National Assembly in mid-May. Mr. Chirac is to 
be the RPR spokesman in this debate in which the opinion of the 
majority may be split along several different lines. 
  Another notable change was the April 2 departure of Pierre 
Lellouche (RPR, Val de l'Oise) for the Judiciary Committee, 
after having bid in vain for chairmanship of the Defense 
Committee.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "Military Planning Law Puts Off </F>
Decision on M5 and ASLP Nuclear Missiles Until 1997"] 
  [Text] The 1995-2000 military planning law, which will be 
put before the cabinet on Wednesday 20 April, to some extent 
puts the fate of the two nuclear weapons projects on hold. 
These projects concern the new generation strategic submarine 
missile, M5 (and possibly a version of the M5 for the Albion 
platform), and the airborne ASLP air-to-surface missile to be 
carried by the Rafale. However, that does not mean that these 
projects have been frozen. Research credits have been earmarked 
for both deterrent weapons systems. However, any decision to 
start -- or, if necessary, abandon -- the development and above 
all the production of these missiles has been delayed until 1997 
when the schedule will be revised to take account of the 
international situation and the state of French public finances. 
  Designed to determine the level of credit for the purchase 
of 
equipment and the number of troops in force for the period 
1995-2000, the military planning law has been drated up by a 
presidential Defense Committee. It will take the form of 
six-year legislation after being submitted to Parliament before 
the end of this spring session. 
  Intended to be the continuation of the 1994 defense white 
paper, the planning project, which translates the white paper 
into budgetary terms, prioritizes a conventional armed force 
charged with foreign missions, and envisages the creation of 
so-called projectable units for long-distance deployment either 
under national command or operating by international mandate. On 
the other hand -- and this is the main turning point in France's 
conception of security compared with previous planning programs 
-- the new draft law more or less signals a pause in plans for 
future nuclear weapons systems. To be more exact, it does not 
make a definite decision between the various options available 
but leaves all avenues open. 
  There are several reasons why things have reached this point 
but the logic is the same in each case: namely, it is too early 
to make a commitment to send plans for nuclear weapons in one 
direction rather than another and so risk making irreversible 
decisions, since the production cycle for this type of weapon is 
in the region of 15 to 20 years. 
  First, financial restrictions weigh heavily, even if France, 
by agreeing to increase its military expenditure despite 
economic difficulties, has taken a direction which runs counter 
to the attitude of most of its allies, who have been obliged to 
make significant defense cuts. Given these financial 
restrictions, the emphasis placed on conventional forces means 
that nuclear investment has to be limited. In addition, the 
priority that was for a long time given to the whole range of 
deterrents was, to some extent, a carryover from the East-West 
Cold War which has since lost much of its meaning. The French 
nuclear arsenal has not suddenly become so obsolete that it has 
to be completely modernized from top to bottom and at any cost. 
Last, it is generally considered that -- without seriously 
jeopardizing its security -- France can wait, and extend the 
life of existing nuclear weapons until such time as they become 
obsolete. The current and foreseeable state of the world no 
longer justifies, as it once did, the deployment of the most 
up-to-date deterrents. 
  All these considerations came into play to ensure that the 
military planning law is kept within reasonable limits. In 1997 
a final decision will have to be taken concerning the different 
formulas that will lay the ground for the weapons systems that 
will replace -- or not replace -- the current M4 submarine-borne 
missiles, the S3D missiles in the Albion platform's silos, and 
the ASMP air-to-ground missiles carried by the Mirage IV, Mirage 
2000-N, and other Super Etendards in service. The aim is still 
for these nuclear weapons to be replaced by their possible 
successors around the year 2010. By then, and between 1995 and 
1997, research credits will continue to be allocated for the M5 
(including for its ground version on the Albion platform) and 
for the ASLP, so that the industrial groups concerned can retain 
their know-how and their engineering teams. 
  If necessary, it will be possible to allocate development 
credits in advance. This should be the case for the 
stato-reactor technology which forms the basis for the ASMP (and 
the new version of the ASLP which will be derived from it), an 
area in which France is still a long way ahead of its 
international rivals. 
<H5>  Will Tests Restart? </H5>
  All this means that, while the core has been retained and 
there is apparently no hurry, it will be up to the next head of 
state to make the final decision, during the first two or three 
years of the planning law, to determine which nuclear weapons 
system will replace the existing submarine missiles and make up 
the rest of the deterrent. It is understood that, in addition 
to the missile-launching submarines, a second strategic 
"component," based on ground-based or airborne missiles, will 
have to be chosen. 
  Whatever decision is made by the next president of the 
republic, it is assumed that by 1995 a solution will have been 
found to the particularly thorny problem of which explosive 
warhead should be used in the nuclear weapons system. The issue 
is not so much the nature of the new missile, but the nuclear 
charge it will carry. 
  The suspension of nuclear testing decreed by Francois 
Mitterrand, due to run until the end of his presidency in May 
1995, prevents experts -- or so it would appear -- from defining 
the characteristics and performance of the warhead which is to 
be adapted to suit the requirements of this second "component." 
All they can hope to do is "patch together" a new warhead using 
existing ones, hoping that laboratory simulations will prove 
sufficient, for the next 10 years, to build the weapon in 
question. However, even if this were the case, it would still 
be unwise to deploy a nuclear weapon whose safety and "scale" 
aspects had not first been subject to full-scale testing. 
  The next head of state will be given two choices that in 
effect come down to the same thing. Either he can prolong the 
test ban and, as a result, he will not be assured of having a 
really new deterrent -- missile and warhead -- ready in time. 
In this case he runs the risk of being accused of having led 
France down the path toward definitively abandoning the very 
principle of deterrent. Or he can take the initiative and break 
the test ban, and then have to modernize the nuclear arsenal 
with the prospect of having to be content with a relatively 
limited number of tests before switching to laboratory 
simulations. In this case, he will need much more courage and 
tenacity to brave the antinuclear campaign in his own country 
and, at the same time, risk turning his back on much of the 
international community, which will be plunged into the torment 
of having to renegotiate the non-proliferation treaty (NPT). 
  A cruel dilemma for a newly elected president to have to 
face 
just after taking up his new office! Those in favor of 
restarting nuclear tests -- unilaterally, if need be -- will not 
be held up by this point of detail. They consider that, on the 
contrary, 1995 will be the year when a new president can -- 
during what is termed the period of presidential grace -- obtain 
the backing for France to participate in the new NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty] framework with the express condition 
that it can first complete its new deterrent by performing any 
remaining tests.

  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur claimed credit on Tuesday [12 April] for an 
overwhelming "Yes" vote by Air France's 40,000 workers to a 
management rescue plan for the loss-making state airline. 
  Balladur said the "success of the referendum," announced on 
Monday, was an illustration "of his government's chosen method," 
a communique from the Prime Minister's Office said. 
  Reforms could only succeed with majority support, the 
communique said, adding that "only dialogue and consultation 
will permit progress on the road of a society that is both 
fairer and more dynamic." 
  The "Balladur method" of government, seen as a succession of 
climbdowns, has come under increasing criticism from within his 
own Rally for the Republic (RPR). Most of the critics are 
supporters of RPR leader Jacques Chirac against Balladur for the 
May 1995 presidential elections. 
  The government came under fire for dropping an earlier 
restructuring plan for Air France last October after a violent 
strike and for caving into student protestors last month by 
withdrawing a scheme to pay young people less than the minimum 
wage. 
  According to official returns, 81.2 percent voted for the 
new 
Air France package, which calls for 5,000 job cuts and a wage 
freeze, intended to cut back on estimated 1993 losses of 7.5 
billion francs (1.25 billion dollars). 
  Acceptance of Air France chairman Christian Blanc's rescue 
plan was a condition for a massive capital injection of 20 
billion francs (3.3 billion dollars) by the government, but the 
European Commission must also approve the recapitalisation plan. 
  Tuesday's communique said that Balladur's privatisation 
programme was financing the capital injection, adding "the 
privatisations are allowing us to provide support for the public 
sector." 
  The communique said the prime minister was anxious to win 
European Union approval for the injection "very quickly." 
Balladur was due to meet European Aeronautical Affairs 
Commissioner Abel Matutes later on Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jacques Calvet: "Saying No to the Current </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] The cantonal elections will be followed shortly by a 
vote to elect European officials. Maastricht was already a 
wakeup call for nearly half the French people; many others voted 
in favor of the treaty not out of the conviction that it was a 
good one, but because they were reluctant to delay what was 
described as a step toward building a united Europe. Maastricht 
has since died--not, unfortunately, in terms of its practical 
consequences, each of which is more loathsome than the next, but 
in the minds of virtually the entire French population. 
  The European elections will at least partly shape the fate 
of 
the European Union for the next five years. The French must take 
advantage of the opportunity to rise up together and deliver a 
resounding "no" to the current Europe of confusion, abandoned 
principles, incompetence, and absurdity. 
  How can Europe get along as Twelve--soon to be 
sixteen--after 
the curious about-face of the French president in Vienna a few 
months ago? In Austria Mitterrand abandoned the notion of 
deepening the Community and revamping its institutions before 
widening it. Meanwhile, the Twelve still do not know what sort 
of common future they would like to have. How can a family, 
company, association, political party, or church establish 
itself before it has ensured that its members adhere to a 
certain number of shared goals? 
  What is the joint position of the Twelve with respect to the 
United States of America or Japan on foreign--or more 
important--trade policy? What is its shared vision of European 
monetary or social policy, from which Great Britain and Denmark 
have been allowed to withdraw? What is the Twelve's common 
assessment of the Community's institutions, executive branch 
(legally, the Council of Ministers; actually the Commission, or 
more accurately the technocrats that sit on it), legislature, 
powers, and sense of responsibilities? What attitude do the 
Twelve share on the serious problem of the need for equality 
among the four biggest countries, Germany, France, Great 
Britain, and Italy? The French head of state abandoned this 
principle of equal weight--to Germany's benefit--during 
discussion of the Maastricht treaty, first when determining 
future European monetary institutions, then the composition of 
the European Parliament. 
  The European Commission has just negotiated with Japan's 
MITI 
[Ministry of International Trade and Industry] the 
implementation--beginning in 1994--of the 31 July 1991 agreement 
on the sale of Japanese cars in the EC. It is just one of many 
examples that could be cited. 
  I protested this accord as soon as it was signed on 31 July 
1991. I underscored the responsibility of its 
negotiators--notably Mr. Mitterrand and European Affairs 
Minister Elisabeth Guigou--for the inevitable rise in 
unemployment and deterioration in living standards that would 
result. The agreement was drafted by the president of the 
European Commission, Mr. Delors, and the commissioner concerned, 
Mr. Bangemann. 
  Unfortunately, everything is happening just as I predicted. 
Year after year, the terms of the accord are flouted; Japan is 
not shouldering its fair share of the slump in the European 
market relative to the Commission's original, too-rosy 
predictions; cars produced in Japanese factories in Europe are 
not counted in the official total of Japanese sales in the 
European Union; and the Japanese market is still virtually 
closed to European car exports. 
<H5>  The False God of Monetary Management </H5>
  Despite the best efforts of the present government, 
particularly Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, the 
Socialist government got off to too bad a start in Paris and 
Brussels for any easy fixes. All we can do now is challenge the 
present Europe of abandoned principles, and define at last a 
common trade policy based on reciprocity rather than wide-eyed 
free-tradism. Europe practices free trade, while the United 
States of America in recent times--and Japan for as long as 
anyone can remember--merely talk about it, while scrupulously 
rejecting it in practice. Automobiles can travel freely on 
public roads, but traffic is organized through systems of 
right-of-way and stoplights. Why not apply a modicum of 
rationality to international trade, which, while free, would be 
based on reciprocal and symmetrical rights and responsibilities 
for all parties involved? 
  Monetary management is the last of the false gods: though 
the 
practical and psychological consequences of joblessness can tear 
a society apart, the extent of unemployment in France and Europe 
alike is underestimated. For advocates of monetary policy, the 
only thing that counts is a rising or falling money supply, "M3" 
in specialists' jargon. And when the money supply does not 
evolve as expected--that is, when it does not expand enough to 
meet objectives--it is interpreted in ways that defy common 
sense to justify a restrictive monetary policy. 
  The Maastricht-stipulated independence of the Bank of 
France, 
which even authorities are beginning to realize is noxious, has 
been another damper on hopes for an economic recovery in France. 
What kind of an orchestra would have one conductor for the brass 
section and another for strings? What kind of soccer team would 
have one tactical coach for forwards and another for defense? 
The previous government debased itself when it abandoned some of 
its prerogatives together with its legitimate responsibilities. 
As for the Bank of France, it tails after Germany's Bundesbank 
like a puppy, despite the fact that the economic situations of 
Germany and France require different monetary policies. In other 
words, our monetary policy is no longer either European or 
French, but purely a product of Germany's. 
<H5>  A String of Concessions </H5>
  Mitterrand takes great delight in talking about our social 
safety net, at the risk of sowing dissension and disorder in 
French society. But the role of a president of the Republic is 
to bring parties together, not divide them. How can Mitterrand 
imagine for one second that we will be able to maintain the 
current standard of living in France and the EC, when he has 
conceded one principle after another in building Europe, and has 
failed to extract a real, jointly-defined trade policy from some 
of our partners? Without monetary and social safeguards, 
competition between the developing countries of southeast Asia, 
including the highly managed economy of Japan, and European 
countries more attentive to the fate of individuals, that is, to 
their real social responsibilities, can only lead to increased 
unemployment and a drop in European living standards. 
  If, as Mitterand claims, we need to define a social policy 
for Europe, we must first found it on a policy that protects 
Europe's economic and trade interests vis-a-vis the rest of the 
world. Staunch European though I am, Europe in its present form 
must be rejected. And if France truly cannot persuade its 
partners to construct a real Europe within the current 
framework, better to abandon what will have been only a dream 
before it becomes a nightmare. We will then have to rebuild our 
country's future in Europe in a precise, courageous, competent, 
and logical fashion, with whatever partners choose to join us.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Philippe Marcovici] </F>
  [Text] For the first time since the beginning of the war, 
NATO planes struck Serbian positions yesterday. Even 
considering that the attacks on Goradze, according to the 
information available yesterday evening, are merely a warning -- 
only two U.S. planes took part in the operation -- the conflict 
in Bosnia has just undergone a major change. 
  Last February, to get Serbian artillery to pull back from 
Sarajevo, the allies issued an ultimatum to [Bosnian Serb 
leader] Radovan Karadzic's troops, threatening them with 
selective air strikes. Nothing like that was seen in Goradze: 
no ultimatum, and probably no selective strikes, but what the 
military calls close air support; in other words support for 
endangered ground troops. Now, since UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force in former Yugoslavia], has no blue helmets in Goradze 
other than one or two observers, we can only conclude that the 
air support was carried out for the sole benefit of the Muslim 
troops. That is where the change lies, and it is a major change 
since it implies that the Atlantic alliance has chosen sides in 
Bosnian conflict which has been raging for the past two years. 
  It is known that NATO and the majority of its member states 
have been eager to dampen Serbian ardor -- to put it mildly -- 
and it is now also clear that, after vascillating for so long, 
they are ready to use force to achieve that end. This is 
especially true of the Americans, since it was two of their 
planes which intervened and they were the first to announce the 
raid. 
  Over and above the circumstances which lend legitimacy to 
yesterday's actions -- the inhabitants were in mortal danger and 
there is a UN resolution which designated Gorazde and five other 
towns as protected areas back in spring 1993 -- the U.S. 
attitude raises a few questions. Washington has always pleaded 
the Muslim cause in Bosnia, but hitherto that pleading has 
always been of a completely platonic nature. Only last week the 
secretary of defense and the Army chief of staff [as published] 
stated unambiguously that they had ruled out any strikes over 
Gorazde. So what on earth could have caused the Clintom 
administration to change its mind? Could it be the pressure 
exerted by public opinion? Or could it be the pressure exerted 
by certain European countries, like France? It is interesting 
that yesterday afternoon, shortly before the air strike, the 
Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] stated that it was prepared to 
shoulder its full responsibilities. 
  Yesterday, the war in Bosnia took on a new dimension. It 
made a huge step toward the internationalization of the conflict.

  [Text] Rome -- A state of maximum alert has been declared 
at all NATO bases in Italy. The security measures, implemented 
on the ground as well as in the air, were strengthened before 
the attack [on Gorazde] and are aimed at avoiding possible 
terrorist attacks and at preventing reprisals. Aircraft at all 
bases are ready to take off immediately. 
  The NATO bases involved are: Aviano, with U.S. F-15, F-16, 
F-18, and A-10 antitank aircraft; Istrana, with French Mirage 
aircraft; Cervia, with French Mirage and Jaguar aircraft; 
Villafranca, with Netherlands F-16's; Ghedi, with Turkish 
F-16's; Gioia del Colle, with RAF Jaguar and Tornado aircraft; 
and Brindisi, with U.S. AC-130's. The latter aircraft, which 
carries a 105-mm gun on its side, was used by the Americans in 
Somalia. 
  The aircraft carriers in the Adriatic Sea -- the USS 
Saratoga; the British Ark Royal, carrying Sea Harriers; and the 
French Clemanceau -- also have been placed on maximum alert.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F>
lower house floor leader, by Enza Cusmai in Pontida on 10 April: 
"Maroni: `Someone Wants Me Dead'" -- first paragraph is IL 
GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Pontida -- Threats. The Northern Leaguer who is 
most favored for the seat of interior minister is the target of 
threats. The last threat dates back to a few days ago; it was 
signed by Walter Alasia, the name of the notorious branch of the 
Red Brigades and said: "We already consider you a dead man." 
Roberto Maroni, the great mediator, lets the news slip through 
in a soft voice while [Northern League Secretary] Bossi is 
speaking on the stage at Pontida. However he does not lose his 
composure even though his expression is not as calm as usual. 
"The police authorities offered an escort, but I do not want it 
because if they want to kill me they will succeed anyway. 
Moreover, I do not want to create any alarm, there are already 
too many problems." 
  [Cusmai] But are you not afraid? 
  [Maroni] Yes, but escorts do not do a great deal. I would 
abolish almost all of them; they cost heaps of money and are 
often given to people that do not need them. 
  [Cusmai] To politicians that are no longer part of the game 
and who feel threatened? 
  [Maroni] Precisely. Those people have to look after 
themselves. Those who were formerly powerful are at a high risk 
just because they are no longer capable of satisfying the 
interests of their old clients. This is their business and does 
not concern the state and the people. 
  [Cusmai] You want to do away with escorts then? 
  [Maroni] I would allow them in dribs and drabs. Today there 
are only about 10 people in Italy whose lives are very much at 
risk. Only they deserve a special treatment because they are all 
the people who are working on the front line and fighting 
against organized crime, both Mafia and ordinary crime. 
  [Cusmai] Today here at Pontida, Marco Formentini [League 
Mayor of Milan officially designated you minister of internal 
affairs. What would be your first measure? 
  [Maroni] I would transfer the Viminale [seat of the Interior 
Ministry] to Palermo or Naples. I realize that this is not any 
easy thing to do. It takes time. Therefore, I would begin by 
immediately decentralizing certain functions and sections. For 
example, I would transfer the anti-Mafia commission to Palermo. 
And I would see Mario Borghezio from Turin, who is highly 
competent and already a member of the anti-Mafia commission, as 
its president. 
  [Cusmai] Why do you want to transfer pieces of the Viminale 
palace? 
  [Maroni] Because the operational and strategic structures of 
the Viminale must be present in the hot areas of the country. 
The people must feel the presence of the state and its 
protection. 
  [Cusmai] Do you not see Milan as being a dangerous city? 
  [Maroni] Of course, it is full of thousands of companies 
that 
are not controlled. Unfortunately, there is no limit to 
financial crime, but it can also be fought with federalism. 
Only this can weaken the Mafia because a large part of its 
revenues does not come from prostitution or drugs but from 
public tenders. In any case, I would transfer the Industry 
Ministry and the CONSOB [National Commission for the Supervision 
of Companies and the Stock Exchange] to Milan. 
  [Cusmai] Let us get back to public order. What do you think 
about the police forces? 
  [Maroni] There is currently no coordination between the 
police, military police, and fiscal police. We have three 
operational centers where antagonism rather than collaboration 
reigns. Well, the battle against crime must begin with the 
total streamlining of these structures. 
  [Cusmai] What do you say about the prefects? 
  [Maroni] They are all public officials who are at the end of 
their careers and their structures are almost useless. The most 
important thing is that they manage civil defense and this 
should be coordinated by the municipalities. 
  [Cusmai] What major damage did the DC [Christian Democratic 
Party] cause during the 40 years in which it managed the 
Interior Ministry? 
  [Maroni] I am trying to think of the good that it did but 
nothing comes to mind. It permitted relations between politics 
and the Mafia, it destroyed local autonomy, it used the secret 
service for political battles. 
  [Cusmai] And what would you do to the secret service? 
  [Maroni] A great uplifting is needed immediately. First, by 
replacing all the executives and top men at once. In addition, 
the new people must be hired through public exams. 
  [Cusmai] Secrecy is not needed then? 
  [Maroni] The structure of the secret service must not be 
secret. I would change its name. I would call it a confidential 
service or a service for democracy. 
  [Cusmai] The Interior Ministry also has jurisdiction over 
local bodies. How should one intervene in this sector? 
  [Maroni] The municipalities should be reorganized, city 
managers introduced, the careers of municipal secretaries 
revised. In practice, the latter should no longer be responsible 
for municipal management, but should become the controllers of 
the legitimacy of acts. The management instead should be 
entrusted to a managerial staff selected by the mayor. This is 
the primary emergency. Only in this way will the municipalities 
be able to govern.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F>
Miglio by Daniele Vimercati in Milan; date not given: "Miglio: 
`The North to Us and the South to Fini'" -- first paragraph is 
IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is Gianfranco Miglio, the 
Lucifer-like professor of the Northern League, the political 
expert from the Cattolica University, who is playing at being a 
Beelzebub and is succeeding to perfection. "Yes, a government 
with Berlusconi and the fascists will be formed." This is 
exactly how he calls them, fascists. However, he is firm about 
governing with them. 
  [Vimercati] But Professor, how can you really believe that 
National Alliance will accept federalism, after having defended 
a strong and centralized state for years? 
  [Miglio] It was easy because they gave in immediately. There 
was agreement on the need for a strong decisionmakerr, elected 
directly by the people, who would act as a meeting point for the 
federal macroregions. We wanted this person to be the prime 
minister, they were focusing on the president of the republic. 
Our formulation was the one that passed, the head of state will 
simply be a guarantor and the president of the Constitutional 
Court. 
  [Vimercati] What did they say to you about the macroregions 
that were judged as being synonymous with an attack on national 
unity until just a few days ago? 
  [Miglio] We did not enter into the details, but the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] people agree in substance. Also 
because they know very well that the governor of the macroregion 
in the South will be one of them, they will have the South in 
their grasp. The same applies for the Reds, who own the center. 
  [Vimercati] Yes, the Reds. How do you foresee reforming the 
Constitution without support from the Left? In the Senate you 
do not have the absolute majority. 
  [Miglio] Well, I hope that Berlusconi will see to buying 
some 
representative from the opposition. I, personally, am convinced 
about the timeliness of having contacts with the left-wing 
parties, also because I know that I have good arguments. 
Moreover, I am really curious about what will happen in that 
field. If they divide themselves, which could be possible, we 
can negotiate. However, I am not obsessed with this problem. 
  [Vimercati] Do you not think that a new Constitution should 
have a consensus that is wider than the one that forms the basis 
of a hard-earned majority government? 
  [Miglio] Absolutely not. We and the fascists have agreed 
that the initiative must be a governmental and not a 
parliamentary one. One twin-assembly associative commission is 
sufficient. The people will then decide. 
  [Vimercati] You keep on repeating: discussing, governing 
with the fascists. As a federalist, does this not have a 
strange effect on you? 
  [Miglio] There are some problems, especially at an 
international level. Public opinion overseas is concerned. A 
private meeting of all the European autonomist movements 
represented in Strasbourg [European Parliament] was held in 
Linate [Milan] today. They let us know that they are not happy. 
However, we are committed to a decisive battle for federalism 
and we cannot be too nice. Even they, the fascists, who until a 
short while ago were asking for the abolition of the regions, 
understand that dangers do exist. 
  [Vimercati] Which dangers? 
  [Miglio] I say that federalism is close, but that if 
something were to go wrong, problems would arise. The North is 
enticed by independence. I will confess that we talked about 
this at the League's last federal council. We asked ourselves: 
Is it perhaps the case of trying to play the card of 
independence? For the time being we are following the principal 
path of federalism, we hope that they are not teasing us. 
  [Vimercati] And if this should happen? 
  [Miglio] We would leave the government immediately. We 
would not keep watch over a dead body. 
  [Vimercati] Does it not seem that the League is experiencing 
a phase of eclipse? 
  [Miglio] On the contrary, the League has demonstrated itself 
to be the central force, it has forced every one to revolve 
around the pivot of federalism. 
  [Vimercati] Observers have the impression that everything is 
revolving around [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. 
  [Miglio] I spoke with him recently. He said that he was 
enthusiastic about our contacts with the MSI people. He added 
that there will be a federal constituent assembly. 
  [Vimercati] And what do you expect from Bossi at Pontida 
[League rally venue]? 
  [Miglio] He will say that he wants federalism immediately of 
course. He will rightly ask for specific and clear pacts. 
  [Vimercati] Are you concerned about Berlusconi's TV 
stations? 
  [Miglio] I am convinced that he has already decided to move 
aside, despite the screams of his plenipotentiary, [Fininvest 
Chairman] Confalonieri. Berlusconi has already reconverted 
himself many times, he can do this one more time. 
  [Vimercati] There is no danger for democracy then? 
  [Miglio] Not if we succeed in imposing a federalism that 
will 
limit any strong power. 
  [Vimercati] And if you do not succeed? 
  [Miglio] Then we can do nothing else but ask Andreotti and 
De 
Mita to return and take charge of the country again. This means 
that we will change the seventh commandment as Dario Fo 
suggested: instead of "no stealing" it will be "steal a little 
less."

  [Text] In Bosnia, the situation appears to be quieter in 
the region of Gorazde following yesterday's second NATO air 
strike on Serb tanks shelling the Muslim enclave. Bosnians 
welcome this show of force. 
  Alain Lamassoure, the French minister delegate of European 
affairs said this morning [on Radio Monte Carlo] that the 
bombing of Serb positions should be extended if the latter were 
to continue their attacks on the Gorazde safe haven. The carrot 
and the stick must be used, Lamassoure added.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Juppe. 
  [Juppe] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] You are the key person behind three issues in the 
news in the last few hours: Edouard Balladur's visit to China, 
NATO air strikes in Gorazde, and chaos in Rwanda against the 
background of tribal war. I would like you to give us details 
on these issues, preferably without any stereotypes. Let's 
start with the visit to China. According to today's newspapers, 
this was not a great success, this was a failure. Are you 
satisfied? 
  [Juppe] We achieved our goal. What was our goal? It was not 
to establish democracy in China within three days. It was not 
to sign contracts, as I have read in some newspapers. Our goal 
was to reestablish a political dialogue with China. What was 
the situation when we came to office last year? China and 
France were not on speaking terms. I will even reveal a detail, 
since you do not want stereotypes: Our ambassador was unable to 
meet Chinese ministers, either in their ministries or in the 
French Embassy. There was no dialogue at all. Can you imagine 
France not communicating with China? 
  [Giesbert] The dialogue was difficult. You ducked the issue 
of human rights. 
  [Juppe] Not at all. We did not duck the issue. France 
outlined what its concept of human rights was in talks between 
the two prime ministers and the two foreign ministers and it 
explained why it considers the human rights situation in China 
to be unsatisfactory. 
  [Giesbert] Dissidents were freed as soon as Edouard Balladur 
left China. 
  [Juppe] I must tell you that I am quite amazed by this way 
of 
presenting things; I was there, things were slightly different. 
When we arrived in Shanghai, we saw press agency reports 
indicating that one or two dissidents had been questioned, not 
arrested, but questioned. We immediately demanded explanations 
-- I did so myself by summoning the Chinese ambassador to my 
office -- and we said that we demanded to know what the real 
situation was. The accompanying Chinese minister, commiting the 
Chinese government, solemnly told us that these arrests had not 
taken place. The Chinese press agency confirmed this 
information the day after our arrival. When I hear today that 
they were freed the day after we had left, I say there has been 
disinformation somewhere. 
  [Giesbert] Are you saying that there were false reports 
somewhere? 
  [Juppe] There was disinformation somewhere. What I can say 
is that we were perfectly clear -- I said so myself to my 
interlocutors -- we came to talk, it is normal, it is necessary 
for France and China to talk to each other; however, we do not 
agree on a certain number of issues and we clearly explained 
which ones. 
  [Giesbert] We noticed a different emphasis between the prime 
minister and yourself. You were firm, extremely firm, and 
Edouard Balladur said that this issue of human rights should be 
settled, I quote, with discretion. 
  [Juppe] I believe that distance is a distortion. I was with 
Edouard Balladur and I did not feel the slightest difference 
between our respective positions. 
  [Giesbert] In an article published in LE JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE 
Bernard Kouchner reproached Edouard Balladur for having given in 
to the Chinese leaders. He spoke of a policy of silence and 
blindness, he blamed you for sacrificing human rights for trade, 
a state trade paid for by the French taxpayers. I was quoting 
Bernard Kouchner. 
  [Juppe] Mr. Kouchner was doing his job -- this time rather 
poorly and in a sectarian manner -- he is in the opposition. He 
preferred to kneel down in front of CNN cameras with a sack of 
rice on his shoulders, this period is over now. 
  [Giesbert] Some weeks ago French diplomacy made a rather 
grand gesture toward China by abandoning -- so the rumor went -- 
Taiwan. Following your return from China, do you have the 
feeling that you have been paid back? 
  [Juppe] This comparison is interesting. We are being told: 
Moral values are at stake, we should not have spoken to China, 
we should have stuck with Taiwan. What was the moral stand 
concerning Taiwan when Mr. Joxe was in office? It was to sell 
Mirage aircraft and frigates. I cannot understand. We did not 
break with Taiwan, we simply told Taiwan that we would honor our 
commitments, whatever the cost. In the future, we will try to 
show a certain restraint concerning arms sales to Taiwan. We 
are ready to continue our cooperation with Taiwan and we will do 
so. Meanwhile, we have quite a lot of things to do in China. 
Do you realize that this country with a population of 1.2 
billion has an annual growth rate of 13 percent? It needs 
telephone lines, nuclear power plants, high-speed trains, it 
needs wheat, it is currently importing wheat. These are issues 
on which we have been working. This will take time because it 
is not the government which decides, but firms which are 
negotiating. It is with this in mind that we resumed the 
dialogue. 
  Let me say that I would like to place this visit to China 
alongside the visits I made to India and Japan. These three 
countries of the world, rather distant from each other, include 
nearly half the world's population. I noted that France had 
been absent from these countries for five to six years; there 
was no visit by ministers, no real political dialogue, no 
commercial ambition. I am being a bit unfair because, 
fortunately, there are French firms working there. Can we have 
a foreign policy while being absent from a region like this? I 
believe that this was the meaning of my visit, too, and I wanted 
to stress this. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, let's now talk about Bosnia. We do 
not really understand what happened in Gorazde yesterday when 
two American planes bombed Serb positions. Was it to protect UN 
soldiers or to prevent Serbs overrunning Gorazde? 
  [Juppe] Both. Gorazde is a safe haven, I will not repeat 
what this means. The United Nations has decided that a certain 
number of zones in Bosnia should be specially protected. I 
believe that we waited for slightly too long; I am delighted 
that we eventually strongly intervened to put on the brake. 
However we must now know what the future holds. 
  [Giesbert] Is this really aimed at putting a brake on? Isn't 
it rather a pinprick? 
  [Juppe] Listen, bombings are never a pinprick. A turning 
point was reached about a month ago with the ultimatum in 
Sarajevo. At the time I said that all this should be part of a 
political and diplomatic plan. What worries me -- besides the 
situation on the ground, obviously -- is that the diplomatic 
process is currently at a virtual standstill. There are talks 
with the Muslims and the Croats on one side; contacts with the 
Serbs have not really resumed yet. What I am asking -- and this 
is rather urgent now -- is to include all these diplomatic 
initiatives into a coherent framework. There is only one such 
plan now, which is the European Union action plan, which makes 
provisions for the sharing of territory between the various 
communities, for lifting sanctions as soon as the Serbs commit 
themselves to peace. I invite all parties -- including the 
Serbs, obviously -- to resume talks on this basis. 
  [Giesbert] Does this mean that you are launching a new Juppe 
initiative? 
  [Juppe] This is not a new initiative. I am reasserting a 
conviction that I have been defending for months. We made a 
significant step forward on the ground by demonstrating our 
will, our resolution and our strength. This should not lead us 
to forget that the one and only possible solution is a 
negotiated settlement. 
  [Giesbert] Do you believe that the United Nations is capable 
of imposing a cease-fire in Gorazde today? 
  [Juppe] I know that steps in that direction have been taken 
and that UN Protection Force officials and a certain number of 
diplomats are trying to get the Bosnian Serb leader, Karadzic, 
and leading Bosnian Muslim officials together so as to resume 
talks. 
  [Giesbert] The Bosnian Muslims are saying, this is too late 
now. This is what the Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic, 
said yesterday. 
  [Juppe] Let me stress that it is never too late and that 
such 
words are unacceptable. 
  [Giesbert] We had the feeling yesterday that the Americans 
were ruling the roost; was that the case? 
  [Juppe] No it was a decision by the Atlantic alliance, 
following a request from the UN secretariat general in the 
framework of an operation in which we are full participants. 
These planes could have been French, French planes are part of 
the Alliance forces. 
  [Giesbert] Let's now discuss the situation in Rwanda, where 
it is the Americans who are absent. We have reports of 
appalling ethnic massacres: Hutus are hunting down Tutsis 
throughout the country and the other way round. 
  [Juppe] We just have to watch pictures to understand that 
there are no limits to horror. As you know France has been 
deeply involved in Rwanda in the past few months in attempts to 
restore peace. 
  [Giesbert] Not very successfully, it seems. 
  [Juppe] We did get results: The Arusha agreements were 
signed, French soldiers were on the scene to help in the 
reconciliation process, and things were moving forward. 
Unfortunately the attack on the plane transporting the 
presidents of Burundi and Rwanda provoked a resumption of the 
fighting. We decided very rapidly, very calmly, and very 
efficiently to set up a plan of action at Kigali airport to 
evacuate our nationals, this has now been nearly achieved. 
  [Giesbert] Some 60 are still there, are you optimistic about 
the evacuation of these last remaining French nationals? 
  [Juppe] We will evacuate them today. 
  [Giesbert] When we see what is going on, do you believe 
France should maintain a presence in Rwanda, in Burundi? 
  [Juppe] We cannot abandon our nationals and I believe that 
it 
is our duty to help the resumption of dialogue. This seems 
impossible when you see what is going on, the level of hatred 
between Hutus and Tutsis, but the Arusha agreements were signed 
and France's role is to attempt everything possible, with the 
neighboring countries, with the OAU, with the United Nations, to 
see reason prevail over the currently raging madness. This is 
our role. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Snub"] </F>
  [Text] Paris -- How many Western politicians have headed to 
Beijing with a smile on their lips and their minds filled with 
dreams of securing various contracts, only to meet with a rude 
awakening when faced with the harsh realities of Chinese 
realpolitik? Mr. Balladur is currently going through the same 
unpleasant experience. The leaders of the Forbidden City are 
past masters in the art of the snub, of contempt, provocation or 
-- even better -- a lack of conscience in international 
relations. 
  Faced with leaders for whom foreign policy is no "gala 
dinner" but rests essentially on a relationship based on a power 
struggle, diplomatic subtleties barely count for anything. Nor 
is it merely a question of generously smiling, bowing and 
scraping, and making concessions in the hope of being paid back 
in return. It is more effective to gain respect by maintaining 
a coherent attitude that is firm when required, flexible when 
necessary, and -- above all -- by knowing one's dossiers inside 
out. 
  It was obvious to anyone with even the slightest knowledge 
of 
China that Mr. Balladur was going to run up against the wall of 
human rights. The U.S. foreign secretary underwent the same 
bitter experience only recently. And yet this experience does 
not appear to have been in vain. New dissidents have been put 
behind bars, forcing the French prime minister, who had hoped -- 
wrongly as it turns out -- to limit the debate to a few 
generally worded formulations, to devote a large proportion of 
his time to that subject, at the expense of laying the 
groundwork for the "major contracts" so dearly sought following 
the normalization of relations last January. 
  China has also placed Mr. Balladur in an untenable position 
in France, where both his "friends" and the opposition were 
awaiting his return without a kind word to say to him. Anyway, 
by publishing an interview with Jacques Chirac in THE PEOPLE'S 
DAILY NEWS one day after his arrival, Beijing clearly showed 
which candidate it is supporting for the presidential election 
in 1995. And it is not Mr. Balladur. 
  China, that major new superpower and product of a new 
economic miracle, might have been expected to behave responsibly 
-- both in the international arena and at home, where the notion 
of freedoms that it defends is only distantly related to the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The remarks made by one 
Chinese official regarding the individuals NEWSWEEK had reported 
as being condemned to death are enough to send a cold shiver 
down anyone's spine: "If the families do not claim their 
bodies, we will use them as fertilizer." 
  However, diplomacy is merely the art of doing what is 
possible. And it might have been hoped that the visit by Mr. 
Balladur would take greater account of Chinese reality as it 
actually is, and less account of a China idealized by its 
sycophants and certain businessmen.

  [Text] Bordeaux, France, April 11 (AFP) -- A bomb alert 
that turned out to be a false alarm was reported Monday [11 
April] on a commercial jet carrying French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe, airline officials said. 
  The French domestic airline Air Inter said the Airbus 300 
carrying 306 people was halfway between Paris and Bordeaux when 
an anonymous caller to Paris' Orly airport said there was a bomb 
on board. 
  The pilot decided to continue the flight, and all the 
passengers were evacuated as soon as the jet landed in Bordeaux 
in southwest France. 
  A search of the aircraft turned up no bomb. 
  Juppe was traveling to Bordeaux to inaugurate an 
organization 
designed to boost trade between regional companies and 
international firms.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chirac Takes Seat on Defense </F>
Committee"] 
  [Text] Jacques Chirac returned to his seat on the 
Parliamentary Defense Committee, which he has belonged to since 
the start of this legislative term but which he recently left to 
join the Cultural, Social, and Family Affairs Committee. The 
return of the Rally for the Republic [RPR] deputy for the 
Correze region to the Defense Committee -- which is chaired by 
Jacques Boyon (RPR, Ain) -- comes at a time when Parliament is 
getting ready to examine the draft military planning law for 
1995-2000. 
  After being submitted to the president of the Republic at 
the 
last meeting of the Defense Council on Wednesday 6 April, the 
document is currently at the State Council stage. It will then 
be presented to cabinet on 20 April before being publicly 
debated in the National Assembly in mid-May. Mr. Chirac is to 
be the RPR spokesman in this debate in which the opinion of the 
majority may be split along several different lines. 
  Another notable change was the April 2 departure of Pierre 
Lellouche (RPR, Val de l'Oise) for the Judiciary Committee, 
after having bid in vain for chairmanship of the Defense 
Committee.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "Military Planning Law Puts Off </F>
Decision on M5 and ASLP Nuclear Missiles Until 1997"] 
  [Text] The 1995-2000 military planning law, which will be 
put before the cabinet on Wednesday 20 April, to some extent 
puts the fate of the two nuclear weapons projects on hold. 
These projects concern the new generation strategic submarine 
missile, M5 (and possibly a version of the M5 for the Albion 
platform), and the airborne ASLP air-to-surface missile to be 
carried by the Rafale. However, that does not mean that these 
projects have been frozen. Research credits have been earmarked 
for both deterrent weapons systems. However, any decision to 
start -- or, if necessary, abandon -- the development and above 
all the production of these missiles has been delayed until 1997 
when the schedule will be revised to take account of the 
international situation and the state of French public finances. 
  Designed to determine the level of credit for the purchase 
of 
equipment and the number of troops in force for the period 
1995-2000, the military planning law has been drated up by a 
presidential Defense Committee. It will take the form of 
six-year legislation after being submitted to Parliament before 
the end of this spring session. 
  Intended to be the continuation of the 1994 defense white 
paper, the planning project, which translates the white paper 
into budgetary terms, prioritizes a conventional armed force 
charged with foreign missions, and envisages the creation of 
so-called projectable units for long-distance deployment either 
under national command or operating by international mandate. On 
the other hand -- and this is the main turning point in France's 
conception of security compared with previous planning programs 
-- the new draft law more or less signals a pause in plans for 
future nuclear weapons systems. To be more exact, it does not 
make a definite decision between the various options available 
but leaves all avenues open. 
  There are several reasons why things have reached this point 
but the logic is the same in each case: namely, it is too early 
to make a commitment to send plans for nuclear weapons in one 
direction rather than another and so risk making irreversible 
decisions, since the production cycle for this type of weapon is 
in the region of 15 to 20 years. 
  First, financial restrictions weigh heavily, even if France, 
by agreeing to increase its military expenditure despite 
economic difficulties, has taken a direction which runs counter 
to the attitude of most of its allies, who have been obliged to 
make significant defense cuts. Given these financial 
restrictions, the emphasis placed on conventional forces means 
that nuclear investment has to be limited. In addition, the 
priority that was for a long time given to the whole range of 
deterrents was, to some extent, a carryover from the East-West 
Cold War which has since lost much of its meaning. The French 
nuclear arsenal has not suddenly become so obsolete that it has 
to be completely modernized from top to bottom and at any cost. 
Last, it is generally considered that -- without seriously 
jeopardizing its security -- France can wait, and extend the 
life of existing nuclear weapons until such time as they become 
obsolete. The current and foreseeable state of the world no 
longer justifies, as it once did, the deployment of the most 
up-to-date deterrents. 
  All these considerations came into play to ensure that the 
military planning law is kept within reasonable limits. In 1997 
a final decision will have to be taken concerning the different 
formulas that will lay the ground for the weapons systems that 
will replace -- or not replace -- the current M4 submarine-borne 
missiles, the S3D missiles in the Albion platform's silos, and 
the ASMP air-to-ground missiles carried by the Mirage IV, Mirage 
2000-N, and other Super Etendards in service. The aim is still 
for these nuclear weapons to be replaced by their possible 
successors around the year 2010. By then, and between 1995 and 
1997, research credits will continue to be allocated for the M5 
(including for its ground version on the Albion platform) and 
for the ASLP, so that the industrial groups concerned can retain 
their know-how and their engineering teams. 
  If necessary, it will be possible to allocate development 
credits in advance. This should be the case for the 
stato-reactor technology which forms the basis for the ASMP (and 
the new version of the ASLP which will be derived from it), an 
area in which France is still a long way ahead of its 
international rivals. 
<H5>  Will Tests Restart? </H5>
  All this means that, while the core has been retained and 
there is apparently no hurry, it will be up to the next head of 
state to make the final decision, during the first two or three 
years of the planning law, to determine which nuclear weapons 
system will replace the existing submarine missiles and make up 
the rest of the deterrent. It is understood that, in addition 
to the missile-launching submarines, a second strategic 
"component," based on ground-based or airborne missiles, will 
have to be chosen. 
  Whatever decision is made by the next president of the 
republic, it is assumed that by 1995 a solution will have been 
found to the particularly thorny problem of which explosive 
warhead should be used in the nuclear weapons system. The issue 
is not so much the nature of the new missile, but the nuclear 
charge it will carry. 
  The suspension of nuclear testing decreed by Francois 
Mitterrand, due to run until the end of his presidency in May 
1995, prevents experts -- or so it would appear -- from defining 
the characteristics and performance of the warhead which is to 
be adapted to suit the requirements of this second "component." 
All they can hope to do is "patch together" a new warhead using 
existing ones, hoping that laboratory simulations will prove 
sufficient, for the next 10 years, to build the weapon in 
question. However, even if this were the case, it would still 
be unwise to deploy a nuclear weapon whose safety and "scale" 
aspects had not first been subject to full-scale testing. 
  The next head of state will be given two choices that in 
effect come down to the same thing. Either he can prolong the 
test ban and, as a result, he will not be assured of having a 
really new deterrent -- missile and warhead -- ready in time. 
In this case he runs the risk of being accused of having led 
France down the path toward definitively abandoning the very 
principle of deterrent. Or he can take the initiative and break 
the test ban, and then have to modernize the nuclear arsenal 
with the prospect of having to be content with a relatively 
limited number of tests before switching to laboratory 
simulations. In this case, he will need much more courage and 
tenacity to brave the antinuclear campaign in his own country 
and, at the same time, risk turning his back on much of the 
international community, which will be plunged into the torment 
of having to renegotiate the non-proliferation treaty (NPT). 
  A cruel dilemma for a newly elected president to have to 
face 
just after taking up his new office! Those in favor of 
restarting nuclear tests -- unilaterally, if need be -- will not 
be held up by this point of detail. They consider that, on the 
contrary, 1995 will be the year when a new president can -- 
during what is termed the period of presidential grace -- obtain 
the backing for France to participate in the new NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty] framework with the express condition 
that it can first complete its new deterrent by performing any 
remaining tests.

  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur claimed credit on Tuesday [12 April] for an 
overwhelming "Yes" vote by Air France's 40,000 workers to a 
management rescue plan for the loss-making state airline. 
  Balladur said the "success of the referendum," announced on 
Monday, was an illustration "of his government's chosen method," 
a communique from the Prime Minister's Office said. 
  Reforms could only succeed with majority support, the 
communique said, adding that "only dialogue and consultation 
will permit progress on the road of a society that is both 
fairer and more dynamic." 
  The "Balladur method" of government, seen as a succession of 
climbdowns, has come under increasing criticism from within his 
own Rally for the Republic (RPR). Most of the critics are 
supporters of RPR leader Jacques Chirac against Balladur for the 
May 1995 presidential elections. 
  The government came under fire for dropping an earlier 
restructuring plan for Air France last October after a violent 
strike and for caving into student protestors last month by 
withdrawing a scheme to pay young people less than the minimum 
wage. 
  According to official returns, 81.2 percent voted for the 
new 
Air France package, which calls for 5,000 job cuts and a wage 
freeze, intended to cut back on estimated 1993 losses of 7.5 
billion francs (1.25 billion dollars). 
  Acceptance of Air France chairman Christian Blanc's rescue 
plan was a condition for a massive capital injection of 20 
billion francs (3.3 billion dollars) by the government, but the 
European Commission must also approve the recapitalisation plan. 
  Tuesday's communique said that Balladur's privatisation 
programme was financing the capital injection, adding "the 
privatisations are allowing us to provide support for the public 
sector." 
  The communique said the prime minister was anxious to win 
European Union approval for the injection "very quickly." 
Balladur was due to meet European Aeronautical Affairs 
Commissioner Abel Matutes later on Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jacques Calvet: "Saying No to the Current </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] The cantonal elections will be followed shortly by a 
vote to elect European officials. Maastricht was already a 
wakeup call for nearly half the French people; many others voted 
in favor of the treaty not out of the conviction that it was a 
good one, but because they were reluctant to delay what was 
described as a step toward building a united Europe. Maastricht 
has since died--not, unfortunately, in terms of its practical 
consequences, each of which is more loathsome than the next, but 
in the minds of virtually the entire French population. 
  The European elections will at least partly shape the fate 
of 
the European Union for the next five years. The French must take 
advantage of the opportunity to rise up together and deliver a 
resounding "no" to the current Europe of confusion, abandoned 
principles, incompetence, and absurdity. 
  How can Europe get along as Twelve--soon to be 
sixteen--after 
the curious about-face of the French president in Vienna a few 
months ago? In Austria Mitterrand abandoned the notion of 
deepening the Community and revamping its institutions before 
widening it. Meanwhile, the Twelve still do not know what sort 
of common future they would like to have. How can a family, 
company, association, political party, or church establish 
itself before it has ensured that its members adhere to a 
certain number of shared goals? 
  What is the joint position of the Twelve with respect to the 
United States of America or Japan on foreign--or more 
important--trade policy? What is its shared vision of European 
monetary or social policy, from which Great Britain and Denmark 
have been allowed to withdraw? What is the Twelve's common 
assessment of the Community's institutions, executive branch 
(legally, the Council of Ministers; actually the Commission, or 
more accurately the technocrats that sit on it), legislature, 
powers, and sense of responsibilities? What attitude do the 
Twelve share on the serious problem of the need for equality 
among the four biggest countries, Germany, France, Great 
Britain, and Italy? The French head of state abandoned this 
principle of equal weight--to Germany's benefit--during 
discussion of the Maastricht treaty, first when determining 
future European monetary institutions, then the composition of 
the European Parliament. 
  The European Commission has just negotiated with Japan's 
MITI 
[Ministry of International Trade and Industry] the 
implementation--beginning in 1994--of the 31 July 1991 agreement 
on the sale of Japanese cars in the EC. It is just one of many 
examples that could be cited. 
  I protested this accord as soon as it was signed on 31 July 
1991. I underscored the responsibility of its 
negotiators--notably Mr. Mitterrand and European Affairs 
Minister Elisabeth Guigou--for the inevitable rise in 
unemployment and deterioration in living standards that would 
result. The agreement was drafted by the president of the 
European Commission, Mr. Delors, and the commissioner concerned, 
Mr. Bangemann. 
  Unfortunately, everything is happening just as I predicted. 
Year after year, the terms of the accord are flouted; Japan is 
not shouldering its fair share of the slump in the European 
market relative to the Commission's original, too-rosy 
predictions; cars produced in Japanese factories in Europe are 
not counted in the official total of Japanese sales in the 
European Union; and the Japanese market is still virtually 
closed to European car exports. 
<H5>  The False God of Monetary Management </H5>
  Despite the best efforts of the present government, 
particularly Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, the 
Socialist government got off to too bad a start in Paris and 
Brussels for any easy fixes. All we can do now is challenge the 
present Europe of abandoned principles, and define at last a 
common trade policy based on reciprocity rather than wide-eyed 
free-tradism. Europe practices free trade, while the United 
States of America in recent times--and Japan for as long as 
anyone can remember--merely talk about it, while scrupulously 
rejecting it in practice. Automobiles can travel freely on 
public roads, but traffic is organized through systems of 
right-of-way and stoplights. Why not apply a modicum of 
rationality to international trade, which, while free, would be 
based on reciprocal and symmetrical rights and responsibilities 
for all parties involved? 
  Monetary management is the last of the false gods: though 
the 
practical and psychological consequences of joblessness can tear 
a society apart, the extent of unemployment in France and Europe 
alike is underestimated. For advocates of monetary policy, the 
only thing that counts is a rising or falling money supply, "M3" 
in specialists' jargon. And when the money supply does not 
evolve as expected--that is, when it does not expand enough to 
meet objectives--it is interpreted in ways that defy common 
sense to justify a restrictive monetary policy. 
  The Maastricht-stipulated independence of the Bank of 
France, 
which even authorities are beginning to realize is noxious, has 
been another damper on hopes for an economic recovery in France. 
What kind of an orchestra would have one conductor for the brass 
section and another for strings? What kind of soccer team would 
have one tactical coach for forwards and another for defense? 
The previous government debased itself when it abandoned some of 
its prerogatives together with its legitimate responsibilities. 
As for the Bank of France, it tails after Germany's Bundesbank 
like a puppy, despite the fact that the economic situations of 
Germany and France require different monetary policies. In other 
words, our monetary policy is no longer either European or 
French, but purely a product of Germany's. 
<H5>  A String of Concessions </H5>
  Mitterrand takes great delight in talking about our social 
safety net, at the risk of sowing dissension and disorder in 
French society. But the role of a president of the Republic is 
to bring parties together, not divide them. How can Mitterrand 
imagine for one second that we will be able to maintain the 
current standard of living in France and the EC, when he has 
conceded one principle after another in building Europe, and has 
failed to extract a real, jointly-defined trade policy from some 
of our partners? Without monetary and social safeguards, 
competition between the developing countries of southeast Asia, 
including the highly managed economy of Japan, and European 
countries more attentive to the fate of individuals, that is, to 
their real social responsibilities, can only lead to increased 
unemployment and a drop in European living standards. 
  If, as Mitterand claims, we need to define a social policy 
for Europe, we must first found it on a policy that protects 
Europe's economic and trade interests vis-a-vis the rest of the 
world. Staunch European though I am, Europe in its present form 
must be rejected. And if France truly cannot persuade its 
partners to construct a real Europe within the current 
framework, better to abandon what will have been only a dream 
before it becomes a nightmare. We will then have to rebuild our 
country's future in Europe in a precise, courageous, competent, 
and logical fashion, with whatever partners choose to join us.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Philippe Marcovici] </F>
  [Text] For the first time since the beginning of the war, 
NATO planes struck Serbian positions yesterday. Even 
considering that the attacks on Goradze, according to the 
information available yesterday evening, are merely a warning -- 
only two U.S. planes took part in the operation -- the conflict 
in Bosnia has just undergone a major change. 
  Last February, to get Serbian artillery to pull back from 
Sarajevo, the allies issued an ultimatum to [Bosnian Serb 
leader] Radovan Karadzic's troops, threatening them with 
selective air strikes. Nothing like that was seen in Goradze: 
no ultimatum, and probably no selective strikes, but what the 
military calls close air support; in other words support for 
endangered ground troops. Now, since UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force in former Yugoslavia], has no blue helmets in Goradze 
other than one or two observers, we can only conclude that the 
air support was carried out for the sole benefit of the Muslim 
troops. That is where the change lies, and it is a major change 
since it implies that the Atlantic alliance has chosen sides in 
Bosnian conflict which has been raging for the past two years. 
  It is known that NATO and the majority of its member states 
have been eager to dampen Serbian ardor -- to put it mildly -- 
and it is now also clear that, after vascillating for so long, 
they are ready to use force to achieve that end. This is 
especially true of the Americans, since it was two of their 
planes which intervened and they were the first to announce the 
raid. 
  Over and above the circumstances which lend legitimacy to 
yesterday's actions -- the inhabitants were in mortal danger and 
there is a UN resolution which designated Gorazde and five other 
towns as protected areas back in spring 1993 -- the U.S. 
attitude raises a few questions. Washington has always pleaded 
the Muslim cause in Bosnia, but hitherto that pleading has 
always been of a completely platonic nature. Only last week the 
secretary of defense and the Army chief of staff [as published] 
stated unambiguously that they had ruled out any strikes over 
Gorazde. So what on earth could have caused the Clintom 
administration to change its mind? Could it be the pressure 
exerted by public opinion? Or could it be the pressure exerted 
by certain European countries, like France? It is interesting 
that yesterday afternoon, shortly before the air strike, the 
Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] stated that it was prepared to 
shoulder its full responsibilities. 
  Yesterday, the war in Bosnia took on a new dimension. It 
made a huge step toward the internationalization of the conflict.

Solana referred to the situation in Bosnia and to Russia. He 
went to Madrid's Barajas Airport to welcome President Boris 
Yeltsin at the start of a three-day visit to Spain, his first 
[official visit to Spain]. Good afternoon, Hector Arenas. 
  [Arenas] Good afternoon. Spanish Foreign Minister Solana 
said when meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin that Spain was 
informed throughout about the attack by NATO aircraft on Serb 
positions [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. Then he said that the 
situation in that region remains delicate and the possibility of 
further allied attacks has not ended: 
  [Begin Solana recording] As you know, the situation is still 
delicate right now. The possibility of there being more actions 
has not ended, but I can tell you that our troops, the Spanish 
troops, who are quite some way from Goradze, are also, 
logically, on prealert. [end recording] 
  Solana also denied that Spain has decided not to offer any 
more economic aid to Russia during Yeltsin's visit. He added 
that they will be offered around $900 million in credit lines, 
agreements, and investment.

caution in the Bosnian situation, and he personally has conveyed 
his concern by phone to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, 
with whom he spoke from here when the second attack on Serbian 
positions was underway. 
  [Begin recording] [Kozyrev in Russian with Spanish

means taking a very big risk. [end recording] 
  [Garcia] According to Kozyrev, the NATO air strikes against 
Serbian positions could backfire because they might make the 
conflict worse. That is why he also described the decision as 
hasty. That is all for the time being.

  [Text] Yeltsin's visit to Spain should mark the beginning 
of a new period of bilateral relations. Today, the two foreign 
ministers signed several cooperation agreements and tomorrow a 
friendship treaty will be signed. 
  The agreements might not be very important if one refers to 
their content, but they are interesting because they relaunch 
Spanish-Russian relations. 
  [Begin Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana recording] 
This 
afternoon we signed five agreements, five important agreements 
that determine the new framework of relations between the 
Russian Federation and Spain. [end recording] 
  Regarding defense -- that is, one of the areas where there 
is 
the most bilateral cooperation -- a red phone line has been 
installed between the Kremlin and the Moncloa Palace. 
  A cultural and educational cooperation agreement builds on 
the Russian desire for links with foreign countries and 
democratization. Another agreement covers social security and 
labor relations providing for exchanges between the two 
countries. 
  The social security agreement puts an end to the 
uncertainties and difficulties of the children of the war, some 
600 Spaniards and their descendants who went to the territory of 
the former Soviet Union during the Spanish civil war. 
  They will now get the minimal pension payments without 
having 
paid into the Spanish social security system. This agreement, 
which does not cover the Spaniards in other former USSR 
republics, was not agreed upon until the very last minute. The 
Russians thought that it was the best way of putting pressure on 
Spain to get a more efficient financial aid.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Asserts That Constitution </F>
Enshrines Unity Through Violence"] 
  [Excerpt] San Sebastian -- Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated in a speech delivered during the 
Aberri Eguna [Basque Fatherland Day] celebrations that his party 
will not confine its political demands to the autonomy statute, 
that the PNV claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories, 
and that the Basque Country will "gradually" achieve a 
"cultural, economic, and ultimately political unity in Europe," 
as well as asserting that the Constitution entrusts the defense 
of Spain's unity to the Army and violence. 
  The PNV, as it has done for the past few years, organized 
two 
different political meetings on the occasion of Aberri Eguna -- 
one in Guipuzcoa in the morning and the second in Bilbao in the 
afternoon. Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza, 
PNV spokesman Joseba Egibar, and candidate in the European 
elections Josu Jon Imaz spoke at the first meeting, in Azpeitia. 
Aberri Eguna was held this year under the watchword "Let's 
improve the Basque Country." 
<H5>  Ability To Decide </H5>
  In statements made both before the political meeting and 
during his speech before PNV members, the PNV leader was highly 
critical of the Socialists. "Since the agreements in Madrid 
began, they have forgotten everything; they have forgotten the 
right of self-determination. They have never been Basque 
nationalists. The ministers, such as Mr. Eguiagaray, speak of 
the nation's government. Clearly, they believe in another 
nation, in another fatherland." 
  Arzalluz stated that the PNV "wants the Basque people to 
have 
the ability to determine their destiny: If they want it to be 
with Spain, then with Spain; if they want it to be with Europe, 
then with Europe; and if they want it to be on their own, then 
on their own," because "a nation that wishes to hold people down 
through coercion will be not a nation but a prison." "Let them 
not come and tell us," he added "that anything can be upheld 
without violence, because then it turns out that when we uphold 
something that comes from our own freedom, everybody attacks 
us." The PNV leader added that the PNV does not have recourse 
to violence: "We simply demand our right to think, to feel, and 
to secure democratically everything that we see fit." 
  Xabier Arzalluz stated that the political activity of the 
PNV, which claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories, is 
not confined to the statute. "While the statute is important, 
we will not stop there," he stated. "They talk a great deal 
about ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty], they have Article 8 of 
the Constitution, specifically designed for reds and 
separatists, in which they entrust the unity of the fatherland, 
of their idea of a territorial fatherland, to the Army, weapons, 
and violence." According to Arzalluz, when the PNV upholds "what 
comes from what we want and our own freedom, everybody attacks 
us, because they have another fatherland." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho has described his 
visit to China as extraordinarily successful. Aho, who returned 
home this afternoon, said before leaving Beijing that Finland 
and China had a good chance to increase their cooperation, 
particularly in the forestry industry, in the energy sector, and 
in environmental protection. Aho said that during the visit 
Finland did not want to make an issue of China's human rights 
policy. 
  [Begin Aho recording] These individual cases, which have 
received quite extensive publicity, were not raised in the talks 
we conducted, and it has not been part of our tradition to 
discuss them in political talks either. We concentrated on a 
more general level on discussing human rights and political 
rights and voiced our views on that. In other words, this issue 
was not discussed. 
  Our basic attitude to human rights issues is similar to that 
of France and other West European countries. Our attitude to 
human rights issues is, in principle, similar, but it must be 
admitted that there have been and are differences in the 
approach between Finland and many West European countries. [end 
recording] 
  The high-level visits between Finland and China will resume 
as early as this spring. Chairman of the Chinese People's 
Congress Li Ruihuan [title as heard] will pay a visit to Finland 
in May.

<F P=106> [Gunnar Magnus report: "Social Democrats Against the EU: </F>
Welfare Policy at Risk"] 
  [Text] At a press conference in Oslo yesterday the Social 
Democrats Against the EU [European Union] (SME) made public a 
brochure containing their arguments against EU membership and 
their vision of a social democratic Norway. 
  "It will be more difficult to realize the Labor Party's 
program if we join the Union," former Minister Tove Strand 
Gerhardsen said. 
  She said that the EU gives the highest priority to the fight 
against rising prices, while any growth in the number of jobs is 
to happen through the market. In the event of Norwegian EU 
membership, the Norwegian authorities will not be able to make 
use of public budgets in the fight against unemployment, she 
said. 
  According to Strand Gerhardsen, it will also be more 
difficult to carry on Norway's social welfare polices if we are 
to make a contribution to the EU budget of between 13 and 17 
billion kroner, in her estimate. 
  "We cannot take the initiative internationally -- build 
bridges -- if we have not won approval for this in the Union," 
Strand Gerhardsen added. He said that if we remain outside the 
EU, then Norway will be able to go its own way to a greater 
extent and be a source of environmental inspiration, for example. 
  Strand Gerhardsen also has reservations about the 
decisionmaking process in the EU, because it is not sufficiently 
open or democratic. Finn Erik Thoresen said that the EU 
represents a lack of freedom for the trade union movement. 
  In its brochure the SME stresses that its opposition to the 
EU is the result of current circumstances -- against the 
background of the Maastricht Treaty and today's EU. Strand 
Gerhardsen was open to the idea of membership of a pan-European 
EU, but said that such a community could not be built on the 
Maastricht Treaty.

<F P=106> [Aslak Bonde report: "Center Party Wants Broad Front in EU </F>
Battle"] 
  [Text] The central executive of the Center Party held an 
extraordinary meeting yesterday to discuss strategy on the EU 
[European Union] question. The main message from the central 
executive was also the extraordinary: The battle to win the 
referendum takes precedence over everything else. 
  The planned program of preparations for the 1995 local 
elections will be postponed to leave enough room for the EU 
struggle, and money need be no obstacle. The Center Party 
leadership told the press yesterday that its successes in the 
elections last year has given the party the finances which make 
it possible to invest millions of kroner in the campaign against 
EU membership. 
  "We will do our bit, and we have some resources. But we also 
know from the last EC battle that it was the broad alliance 
across the great divides which ensured a `no' majority. In the 
same way we must allow `No to the EU' to coordinate the fight 
this time too so that the resources of all organizations and 
parties are used in the best way possible," Center Party leader 
Anne Enger Lahnstein said. 
  She dismissed a question about whether this is an indication 
that she does not want to be the "no" queen. 
  "We are not the ones using such titles, but there can be no 
doubt that there is teamwork both among us and in other 
organizations combined with a cross-political grass-roots 
involvement which will guarantee victory," she said. 
  There is little reason to expect the Center Party to slip 
into the shadows, even if it does become clear that it will be 
"No to the EU" which will coordinate the campaign against 
membership. The party has plans to advertise posts so that it 
will be able to improve its EU competence, and leaflets will be 
produced. The Center Party will make its contribution through 
its part of what the party calls popular education and facts 
about the EU and the results achieved in the negotiations. 
  Yesterday the central executive also set up its own strategy 
committee which will evaluate the EU battle more or less day by 
day. The committee consists of the party leader, the two deputy 
chairmen, and the party secretary in addition to the Storting 
group's political and administrative leaders and the Center 
Party's members of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Of the eight members of the strategy committee only two are 
not at the Storting every day. Nevertheless the party 
leadership is stressing that the real work against EU membership 
must take place at grass-roots level.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Conservative Party chairman Kaci </F>
Kullmann Five by Heidi Borud; place and date not given] 
  [Text] It is not a beaten party leader who will be saying 
"Thank you and good-bye" at the Conservative Party national 
conference at the weekend. A very positive Conservative Party 
leader is putting the finishing touches to the speech she will 
deliver to the conference in Bergen on Friday [8 April]. 
  The Grieg Hall and the Hotell Norge will be the two arenas 
for the Conservatives' national conference at which Kaci 
Kullmann Five will hand over the chairman's gavel to her good 
friend, Storting deputy Jan Petersen -- he too comes from 
Akershus. 
  The two know each other well from over 20 years of close 
political cooperation. And Kullmann Five is generous in her 
praise: "Jan is solid through and through and extremely 
capable. He is a politician with broad experience -- much 
broader than many people think." 
  Kaci Kullmann Five stressed that she is not saying good-bye 
to Norwegian national politics. A Conservative Party with a 
thin 17 percent of support does not scare this lady away from 
new positions of responsibility. She will continue as the 
Conservative Party's EU [European Union] spokeswoman in the 
Storting and have a seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee 
alongside Jan Petersen, among others. 
  Will you be the Conservative Party's prime ministerial 
candidate in the 1997 Storting elections? 
  "I have not come to any decision about what my life will be 
like in 1997, about whether I will continue in politics or not. 
It is the party and the Storting group which together will 
decide who they will ask to become the party's prime ministerial 
candidate." 
  The current battle surrounding the EU will be the main theme 
of the party leader's speech to the national conference. She 
makes it very clear that in the ranks of the Conservative Party 
too there are many who have their doubts about the EU, even some 
opponents, who have to be won over. In the last election the 
Conservative Party lost 36,000 voters to the Center Party. 
  "There will be no Norwegian EU membership if the 
Conservative 
Party does not do its part of the job. We have to get the 
doubters over onto the `yes' side. The Labor Party is important 
in this context, but they cannot do the job alone," she pointed 
out. 
  In her EU arguments she attaches great importance to the 
overarching peace and security dimensions, and she made it clear 
that she has little time for "newly converted Socialist Left 
Party members who think that NATO is enough." 
  "NATO is important, but the EU will play the totally 
dominant 
role in the peacekeeping work in Europe. This is work that goes 
much further than what is purely defense policy and which 
includes the environment, trade, and the economy," the former 
trade minister said. 
  "A pan-European security solution is within reach. Even if 
Anne Enger Lahnstein refuses to realize it, it is nevertheless a 
fact that the countries of East Europe are moving toward the 
EU," Kullmann Five said. 
  She sees the EU as an important tool for combatting negative 
nationalism -- and as a tool which could could make a 
contribution to the construction of democracy in the former East 
European states. 
  Environmental policy is another area which figure frequently 
in the Conservative Party's arguments in favor of EU membership: 
  "I am not satisfied with the EU's environmental policy, and 
it will be a great challenge to strengthen it. But it is worth 
noting statements from the well regarded World Watch Institute 
which writes that the EU has contributed to better environmental 
conditions across the whole continent," Kullmann Five said. 
  She said that the Conservative Party will fight for its 
political values and its policies inside the European Union: 
"We will combat the bureaucracy, among other things. Here the 
EU has gone too far. And as far as supranationality and the 
environment are concerned, it has not gone far enough," she said. 
  When the EU referendum is over, international environmental 
issues will be one of the fields in which she wants to work more 
from her place on the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  What are the most important political results the 
Conservative Party has achieved under your leadership? 
  "What I am most happy about is that we were able to defend 
the watercourses at Stryn and Gaular. This was all thanks to 
the Conservative Party and is of great importance for 
biodiversity, the experience of nature, and tourism. 
  ``But the most important goal -- government power -- we did 
not achieve. Henry Valen is right when he says that the EU 
question has hit the Conservative Party hard.'' 
  Is there any hope of a nonsocialist coalition after the EU 
referendum? 
  "One can always hope, but it is the Center Party that is the 
main problem, not the Conservative Party. This is something 
that I would like AFTENPOSTEN's leader writers to realize soon. 
There is actually a party that has disappeared on the 
nonsocialist side and this is not the Conservative Party's 
fault."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Dan Ericssom, Christian Democratic </F>
Community Party secretary, by Monica Bjorklund; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] A really dirty Social Democratic election campaign 
intended to push the Christian Democrats out of the Riksdag -- 
that is what the Christian Democratic Community Party [KDS] is 
expecting and already seeing signs of. 
  "The Social Democrats do not shy away from engaging in 
incredibly negative campaigns," party secretary Dan Ericsson 
said. "In their own election documents you can see that in 
August they intend to demoralize the government parties' people, 
and for a week in September they will push out one of smaller 
parties. 
  ``They have put together reports about us, found quotes 
which 
are being used in campaigns of letters to newspapers, and do not 
even shy away from writing letters signed `local KDS 
supporter.''' 
  Social Democratic Party secretary Mona Sahlin often declares 
that the KDS is a party on the right wing. This is part of the 
Social Democratic campaign against the KDS, according to Dan 
Ericsson. 
  "It is their strategy, voiced a long time ago, to try to get 
at the KDS by getting us into the right-wing trap. If you are 
right wing you frighten people. Regardless of what we say on 
the issues, they will go on hammering this message home." 
  The KDS is not a right-wing party, Dan Ericsson stressed. It 
is a party in the political center. 
  In the latest Sifo [Swedish Institute for Opinion Research] 
poll, the KDS comes dangerously close to the 4 percent threshold 
for representation in the Riksdag. But the party feels far from 
down for the count. 
  "Our ambition is to win back the voters we have lost since 
the election. And also win some new voters from the Social 
Democrats," Dan Ericsson said. 
  He received me in his office at the KDS Riksdag chancellery. 
And he protested immediately when he saw the headline over the 
diagram which will accompany the interview: "KDS Voters Pull to 
the Right." 
  "Since the election we have lost just as much to the Social 
Democrats as to the nonsocialist parties," he explained. 
  The Christian Democrats will concentrate on five issues in 
the election campaign: family policy, care services and the 
care of the elderly, legal issues, environmental policy, and 
economic policy. 
  Family policy is not only about child-care allowances, but 
above all about putting the family in the center and supporting 
it in different ways. 
  The care services and the care of the elderly are, in part, 
about getting more resources for them. Dan Ericsson was 
unwilling to say exactly where this money will be taken from, 
but a solution involving some form of care insurance could be 
part of the picture here. 
  "The fact that the Social Democrats have gone public and 
said 
that health care does not need any more money is sensational, to 
say the least, bearing in mind how harshly they have criticized 
us when we have been unable to win over other parties on issues 
relating to care." 
  On legal issues the KDS will stress ethics. It is impossible 
to get at crime if people do not have a clear ethical foundation 
on which to stand, the party believes. Schools must assume a 
more educational role, according to the party secretary. 
  On environmental policy the KDS will demonstrate that it is 
a committed environmentalist party which has pushed 
environmental issues hard during the life of this government. 
  In economic policy the KDS will continue to try to sell its 
proposal for tax subsidies for jobs in the home performed by 
young people. But there is no suggestion of a general tax 
rebate for domestic services. 
  The EU [European Union] issue cuts right through the 
Christian Democratic Community Party. The party leadership are 
convinced supporters of membership of the EU, but among the 
party's sympathizers there is more of majority for "no." 
  "This is probably because many people have not seen the 
overall picture yet," Dan Ericsson said hopefully. 
  He thinks that the Social Democrats' party secretary, Mona 
Sahlin, has harmed the whole EU issue by saying that farmers and 
businessmen should pay an additional EU contribution. 
  "This is completely absurd. The EU is a shared commitment. 
Statements like these only create confusion." 
  Nor does he have any time for Center Party leader Olof 
Johansson's proposal that increased environmental levies should 
finance Sweden's contribution to the EU budget. 
  "There should be no earmarked financing of the EU budget 
contribution." 
  An issue which cuts right through the nonsocialist coalition 
government is the rundown of nuclear power. The KDS and the 
Center Party want legislation to the effect that 2010 will be 
the final year. The Moderate Coalition Party wants to continue 
to operate the nuclear power stations as long as safety can be 
guaranteed. Dan Ericsson admitted that the Moderate position is 
"a little threat to the cohesion of the government." 
  "I really think that the Moderates should think this one 
through."

<F P=106> [Inger Jagerhorn article: "EU Could Mean Grand Slam for </F>
Sparsely Populated Areas"] 
  [Text] Sweden's sparsely populated areas could win a grand 
slam in the event of Swedish EU [European Union] membership. At 
the same time an internal tug-of-war has already begun about 
where the Swedish share of the money should come from. 
  In principle, Sweden's current regional support grants can 
continue more or less as hitherto. The grand slam will occur 
when about the same amount of regional support money -- from the 
EU's coffers -- is added. 
  Swedish farmers will receive more support in the future if 
the EU is responsible for payments than they would if the money 
came from the Swedish state. But the question is whether it is 
not the sparsely populated areas that will be the real winners 
(also in those cases where the recipients of support coincide). 
  "But those local politicians who have already added a number 
of millions per inhabitant to their budgets are probably 
counting their chickens before they are hatched," said Gunnar 
Blomkvist, Labor Ministry assistant under secretary. 
  However, there will be money. It is not surprising that at 
their meeting in Ornskoldsvik a week ago the governors of 
Sweden's five northernmost provinces were jubilant. And they 
seem quite happy to accept the other side of the coin: that 
they themselves will have less say. 
  Swedish regional policy will no longer be decided 
exclusively 
inside the country's borders. Hitherto provincial governments 
have ruled the roost and had their own regional policy budgets. 
Now it will be the Commission in Brussels which will set its 
seal of approval on various programs, at least formally and as a 
finishing touch. 
  But there will be no automatic inflow of a number of 
billions 
per year, Gunnar Blomkvist explained. The sums could vary from 
year to year, perhaps with a peak in 1995-96. Sweden must 
provide the EU with details of what it wants to do with the 
money. 
  Also, there must always be matching sum of national money 
for 
investment, in certain cases a krona for every EU krona, in 
other cases a little more or a little less in national 
investments. If Sweden chooses not to contribute any money, 
there will not be any EU money either. 
  "We have to match sums of money for everything we want to 
do," Gunnar Blomkvist said. 
  The introductory fanfares to an internal tug-of-war about 
where the Swedish money is to be taken from can already be 
heard. According to Gunnar Blomkvist, the EU defines "regional 
policy" in much broader terms than Sweden. 
  "No definition says that the EU's money must be matched by 
money which goes under the name of Swedish regional policy 
funds," Blomkvist said. He stressed that the EU is really more 
oriented toward what in Sweden is called "major" regional 
policy, and this money is not available to the Labor Ministry. 
  "The extent to which regional support money determines 
conditions in the interior of Norrland is very small. The 
arrangements affecting air traffic, freight transport, post, 
telecommunications, health care, education, research, and so on 
are much more important. To say nothing of contributions from 
the state in the form of tax equalization." 
  This is what people in Sweden call "major" regional policy. 
  The Swedish money will probably therefore be taken from many 
sources: from the government, from Nutek, from provincial 
administration's funds, from regional high school investment 
(such as Ostersund's high school), and the like. 
  Would it not be simplest to keep total regional support at 
more or less the old level simply by halving the Swedish grants 
and letting the EU be responsible for the other half? 
  "No, that is not at possible," Gunnar Blomkvist said. "This 
conflicts with the principle of additionality. Well," he 
explained patiently, "EU money presupposes that each country 
matches EU money with fresh money, in addition to the money that 
is already being spent on regional policy. There is a ban on 
subtraction, as we have understood it." 
  However, stubborn rumors from Brussels would have it that 
the 
borderline between old money and fresh money is not always that 
clear in all countries. 
  This is how a law-abiding EU country should behave. 
  1. First the EU seeks clarification from Sweden about what 
we want to do in respect of Objectives 2, 6 and the other 
objectives. 
  2. The EU requires member countries to draw up a program for 
each regional policy budget period. The present period covers 
the years 1994 to 1999. Sweden may become a member in 1995 and 
would then have a shorter period to plan for. 
  3. Finally it is decided how finance is to be arranged. 
  The work involved in such a program will not be a great 
culture shock for Sweden. Today national programs are drawn up 
annually on the foundation of a long-term strategy. Things 
would have been more difficult around 10 years ago. Sweden has 
never had such carefully delineated systems. 
  The negotiations which were completed in Brussels on 1 March 
only set out the broad policy framework for regional policy. 
The rest -- and a lot is involved here -- must be clarified 
before the end of the year. This will not be at ministerial 
level, but in direct discussions between Sweden and the EU 
Commission, which is responsible for the practical application 
of regional policy. 
  Many questions will need to be answered. When will the 
balance between the EU's various "objectives" be clarified as 
far as Sweden is concerned? What does the Commission want to 
decide and what can be decided in Sweden? And not least the 
sensitive question: What things ought ideally to be clarified 
before the referendum? 
  For the government the EU campaign will be a balancing act. 
Do not promise too little, for the aim is to disarm with 
suitable bait the northern parts of the country where the 
majority of the opponents of the EU are to be found. But not to 
promise too much either, so that it is accused of already taking 
membership for granted. 
  Today the "little" regional policy kitty in Sweden is around 
2.6 billion kronor. These are funds which the Labor Ministry 
has at its disposal. In most cases the freedom for maneuver is 
relatively limited -- where the money will go is decided more or 
less automatically. 
  In the event of EU membership an EU kitty of around 2.4 
billion kronor will be added to this Swedish kitty of 2.6 
billion kronor. 
  The money for "major" regional policy is elsewhere. Here the 
flexibility is greater. 
  The fund that has attracted the most attention -- Objective 
6, which was tailor-made for the Nordic area in the negotiations 
-- is small beer in this context. It contains no more than 
around 380 million kronor. The largest part of this will be 
spent on roads, railroads, research, education and training, and 
retraining programs. 
  It will also be possible for Sweden to seek grants from five 
of the EU's six other regional policy funds. This is where the 
big money is. Two billion kronor are within Sweden's grasp. 
  Not all these grants are tied to the regions which will 
receive support under the terms agreed in the negotiations 
between the EU and Sweden. The money for objectives 3, 4, and 
5a could go to support projects throughout the country. It is 
only objectives 2 and 5b and the new objective 6 which are 
geographically tied. Once the map has been drawn and sums of 
money decided the Swedish authorities can more or less decide 
how the grants are to be spent. 
  The only "objective" that is closed to Sweden is objective 
1. 
Objective 6 can be said to be the northern variant of this. 
Objective 1 is generally called the misery fund. The support 
for the EU's poorest areas is paid out from it. 
  For objective 6 it is Nordic-style misery which applies: 
sparse population, long distances, and cold climate. In the 
eyes of the EU these disadvantages can be cancelled out by 
relatively high incomes. 
  For a while the EU's negotiators had difficulty in 
understanding that the Swedish maps showing massive GNP incomes 
per person which were being sent to Brussels were only 
statistics produced by civil servants which could not be linked 
to the real living standards of inhabitants. Hydroelectric 
power or a pulp mill could distort the picture and the Swedish 
papers were therefore misleading -- something which the Swedish 
negotiators were forced to remind their counterparts 
energetically. 
<H5>  [Box, p A7] </H5>
<H5>  EU Objective Funds </H5>
  Objective 1 -- To promote the development of underdeveloped 
regions. The "misery fund." Not open to Sweden. 
  Objective 2 -- To restructure regions with industries in 
decline (linked to areas receiving support). 
  Objective 3 -- To combat long-term unemployment (applies to 
the whole country). 
  Objective 4 -- To facilitate the entry onto the labor market 
of young people (applies to the whole country). 
  Objective 5a -- To restructure agriculture and forestry 
(applies to the whole country). 
  Objective 5b -- To facilitate the development of 
agricultural 
areas (linked to areas receiving support). 
  Objective 6 -- New fund set up for sparsely populated 
regions 
with a cold climate. Nordic "misery fund" (linked to areas 
receiving support).

<F P=106> [Article by by Stefan Hedlund, professor of East European </F>
studies; from the "Focus" column: "Few Care About the Baltic 
Region's Cry for Help"] 
  [Text] The cinemas are currently showing a film that is 
particularly frightening in its topicality. It is called "The 
Remains of the Day." Its subject is policy toward Germany in 
the run-up to World War II and its "hero" an English lord who 
has taken it upon himself to counter what he sees as anti-German 
and warmongering sentiments chiefly in England and France. To 
achieve this aim he makes his home available for secret talks 
between delegates from a number of different countries, 
including Germany. Many fine sounding words about peace and 
security are spoken, and about the need to help rather than 
further humiliate Germany. 
  At one particular secret night meeting the noble lord brings 
together his own country's political leadership and a 
high-ranking German delegation. On the subject of the 
Sudetenland the British foreign secretary pronounces the classic 
sentence about "a distant country about which we know nothing." 
Naturally the leaders of the Western powers must be persuaded 
to accept Germany's just demands: all in the interests of peace 
and security. That was how the Czechs were sacrificed, and what 
was to ensue is history. 
  People in the countries which feel vulnerable to an 
increasingly aggressive Russian nationalism are talking more and 
more about this history. However, as in 1938, there are very 
few who care about their cry for help. We have to think about 
the major outlines, about peace and security. 
  Not so long ago we were informed as a result of the work of 
SVENSKA DAGBLADET's excellent investigative journalist, Mikael 
Holmstrom, that for some time now there has been a secret group 
consisting of representatives of a number of Western countries 
which, under the leadership of Prime Minister Carl Bildt, is 
trying to find a solution to the problem of Russia's demands on 
the Baltic republics, chiefly Estonia and Latvia. Last week 
this secret group succeeded in pressuring the Latvian Government 
into signing an agreement which -- as in 1938 -- will guarantee 
peace and stability. 
  The agreement, which is currently being scrutinized by the 
Latvian parliament, means that Russia undertakes to withdraw all 
its remaining troops by 31 August at the latest, in return for 
being allowed to make use of the Skrunda radar installation 
until the end of the century, and that 35,000 retired officers 
and their families are granted the right to remain in Latvia, at 
the expense of the impoverished Latvian Government. 
  This may seem like a major diplomatic victory which 
demonstrates the superiority of silent diplomacy in sensitive 
situations. However, this would be to forget two important facts. 
  First, the Skrunda radar installation has none of the 
strategic value it is claimed to have. The United States, 
however, has every interest in Russia's not being forced to 
leave the base. For this could lead to calls for the United 
States to leave forward bases elsewhere in the world. 
  The Latvian side must, of course, be made to "understand" 
this and Russia accepts with thanks. 
  Second, the pension issue is hardly a case of humanitarian 
care for Russian officers who have served their time and who 
will be able to enjoy the autumn of their lives in Latvia. Many 
of them are elite soldiers, reserve officers in the 
35-40-years-old range who are both armed and have their places 
of mobilization in the event of war. Their mission is clear. 
Last spring all the Russian forces in the Baltic held a staff 
coordination exercise the aim of which was clearly expressed: 
"to take strategic targets and hold them until the main force 
arrives." 
  The significance of the agreement the Swedish Government is 
now seeking to force the Latvian side into signing is thus that 
an armed fifth column of 35,000 men with arms and a well defined 
mission to carry out in the event of war is to be allowed to 
remain in Latvia, and that a major military base there will not 
be closed for several years yet, perhaps never. It is most 
understandable that the Latvian side wants to defend itself 
against such a stab in the back. 
  However, what is totally incomprehensible is that the 
Swedish 
Government can be involved in sacrificing Latvia this way to 
placate Russia. Perhaps our ministers ought to go together to 
see "The Remains of the Day," perhaps they should recall what 
happened once Hitler had been appeased with Sudetenland. 
  You do not need to listen to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's threats 
to realize how precarious the situation is for our Baltic 
neighbors. On 5 April in Moscow, President Yeltsin signed an 
"Instruction" with the following wording: 
  ``Concur with a proposal from Russia's Defense Ministry 
which 
has reached agreement with Russia's Foreign Ministry; on the 
establishment on the territory of all member states of the CIS 
and the Latvian Republic of military bases for the Russian 
Federation's Armed Forces, with the aim of ensuring the security 
of the Russian Federation and the above-mentioned states, and of 
testing new weapons systems and military technology. 
  ``Instruct Russia's Foreign Ministry together with Russia's 
Defense Ministry and the other ministries and authorities 
affected to hold talks on this question with the member states 
of the CIS and the Latvian Republic, and to draft the necessary 
documents.'' 
  This document is being taken very seriously indeed in Riga. 
In a reaction Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins has spoken of an 
"escalation," and said that Russia has now begun to "speak out 
clearly" about its intentions. The Russian side immediately 
retracted [the instructions] and said that Latvia was included 
"by mistake." This cat-and-mouse game is typical of Russian 
policy toward the Baltic states. There have been many similar 
maneuvers in the past. 
  The game being played by Moscow is as distasteful as it is 
dangerous. It is late in the day. Sweden must now once and for 
all make it clear what we think about Russia's ever more 
aggressive policy toward our Baltic neighbors. Tomorrow it 
could be too late.

  [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis warned that the 
continuation of dialogue will not be productive unless the UN 
Security Council makes the necessary decisions. One of these 
decisions, he stressed, is the disarmament of Cyprus. President 
Kliridhis made his statement this morning at Larnaca Airport 
before leaving for Strasbourg, where he will address the Council 
of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. 
  President Kliridhis was talking with regard to the backstage 
deliberations at the Security Council regarding the UN secretary 
general's report. With the intervention Of Britain, the 
president said, the first report prepared by the UN secretary 
general's representatives in Cyprus did not circulate 
officially. The second one, which was prepared later, did. But 
the president said the British side claimed it intervened so 
that no report would circulate for 15 days so as to give the 
Turkish side time to accept the documents. President Kliridhis 
revealed that the UN secretary general's report, which was not 
circulated, noted very clearly that the Turkish Cypriot side 
does not have the political will to find a solution. He said 
the report also noted that there was no progress on the 
substance of the Cyprus issue or the Butrus-Ghali ideas, because 
there was no political will from the Turkish side. [passage

<H5>  Package of Confidence-Building Measures Must Provide Equal </H5>
Benefits 
  First, I wish to explain the developments related to the 
package of confidence-building measures [CBM's] in chronological 
order and then outline the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus] Government's approach. It is common knowledge that the 
CBM's package, mainly the question of the resettlement of Maras 
[Varosha] and the reopening of Nicosia International Airport to 
passenger and cargo traffic, has been the priority issue on the 
UN representatives' agenda for some time. The list of CBM's 
that the UN Secretariat submitted to the two sides in Cyprus in 
1993 contains 12 other measures in addition to those on Maras 
and Nicosia International Airport, measures which call, among 
other things, for cooperation to improve water resources, equal 
use of foreign aid by the two sides, and cooperation to improve 
health services and the protection of the environment. 
  The introduction of the CBM's package brought to light 
various shortcomings in the effort that was required to realize 
it. A group of UN experts studied the situation in Maras and 
Nicosia International Airport and drew up reports to remove the 
shortcomings. Their reports clarified to a certain extent the 
benefits the two sides stand to gain from the opening of Maras 
and Nicosia International Airport. Although their reports 
failed to fully satisfy the technical questions the Turkish 
Cypriot side had put to the UN Secretariat earlier, it is a 
clear fact that they should have been regarded as an important 
resource for the effort that was made for a reconciliation 
between the two sides on the matter. However, it is common 
knowledge that the Greek Cypriot side said that the reports are 
not binding on them in any way and that they refuse to agree to 
have them either added to the CBM's package or converted into 
official UN documents. 
  Obviously, the Greek Cypriot side's approach has had a 
negative impact on the effort made to clarify administrative, 
political, and technical matters related to the implementation 
of the package. 
<H5>  We Agree in Principle To Maintain the Talks </H5>
  The Turkish Cypriot side informed the UN secretary general 
some time ago that it agreed in principle to hold talks on Maras 
and Nicosia International Airport. In his letter to the sides 
dated 3 February 1994, the UN secretary general welcomed their 
decision to agree in principle to discuss the package and called 
for the commencement of talks to prepare the modalities 
[previous word in English] required for the implementation of 
the measures. The points the UN secretary general urged the 
sides to keep in mind during that process are as follows: 
  1. Neither of the sides will move with the intention of 
establishing political advantage over the other. 
  2. The sides will remain committed to the stipulations of 
the package. 
  3. Initiatives that may obstruct the realization of the 
package will be avoided. 
  4. The package will not be regarded as a substitute for a 
comprehensive agreement. 
  Consequently, the two sides moved to hold talks on the 
modalities. A seven-point list of provisions was drawn up 
during the contacts the UN officials held with the two sides 
early in February. The list would later be regarded as the 
agenda of the indirect talks. It was related to matters such as 
the UN administration in Maras and travel to and from that area, 
the timing of the transfer of Maras to UN officials and the 
reopening of Nicosia International Airport, conversion of Maras 
into a special trade and contact area, establishment of rights 
related to flights to and from Nicosia International Airport, 
establishment of security for operations in that airport, entry 
and exit of passengers and cargo, and the implementation of the 
other UN measures. 
  As I briefly mentioned earlier, the other CBM's were 
outlined 
in 12 points, that is, other than those related to Maras and 
Nicosia International Airport. 
  The objective of the indirect talks, which were initiated by 
Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative, on 
17 February, was to have the two sides agree on the way the 
CBM's package should be realized. It will be recalled that the 
UN secretary general submitted a report to the UN Security 
Council informing it that the positions of the two sides were 
established through the contacts that were made with them from 
January to March and that the UN representatives would make 
suggestions to them for the implementation of the items on the 
agenda of the talks. Acting in accordance with the UN secretary 
general's report, Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's 
assistant special envoy, submitted draft suggestions and a 
paper, which was described as a non-document, on 9 and 21 March. 
  The assessment that was made of the documents revealed that 
the reports that were drawn up by the UN experts on Maras and 
Nicosia International Airport were not regarded as a resource as 
a result of the Greek Cypriot side's pressure, a deviation was 
made from the essence of the original CBM's package to satisfy 
Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot 
side, a deviation in the form of additions to the CBM's package, 
and various elements in the original package were overlooked. 
For example, the gains referred to in Paragraph 44 in the UN 
secretary general's report, dated 1 July 1993, were not included 
in the non-document. That showed that the reference that was 
made to them was merely words. While elements were introduced 
to satisfy Mr. Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side, only a 
number of superficial promises were made on the question of the 
registration of the Turkish Cypriot side's economic gains and 
evident rights. Meanwhile, it was observed that even those 
promises were conditional. 
  That development created a new situation which failed to 
satisfy the criteria on equality and simultaneous benefits, on 
which the Turkish Cypriot side has maintained a sensitive 
approach right from the beginning. Obviously, the inclusion of 
additional elements within the framework of the talks in order 
to satisfy the Greek Cypriot side will create a difficult 
situation in the negotiations process. The Turkish Cypriot side 
cannot be held responsible for the present situation because the 
Greek Cypriot side has indicated that it regards the CBM's 
package as a process on Maras. 
  As a gesture of goodwill, President Denktas submitted a new 
document to Gustave Feissel to prevent a deadlock in the talks 
and explain the Turkish Cypriot side's stand on the matter a few 
days ago. His document guaranteed that the Greek Cypriots would 
be able to safely enter and leave Maras freely and without 
formality or restrictions. 
  The Turkish Cypriot side maintains a sensitive stand on the 
equal benefits and opportunities the CBM's package will provide 
for the two sides. That the gains of the Turkish Cypriot side 
should be equal to those of the Greek Cypriot side, that they 
should be simultaneous, tangible, and durable, and that they 
should be concrete and guaranteed is essential. However, the 
changes that were effected in the package with a view to 
pleasing the Greek Cypriots have upset the parameters of that 
package both from the point of view of its contents and from the 
point of view of its presentation. 
  Regarding the Turkish Cypriot side's gains, a promise was 
made to the effect that the necessary arrangements are to be 
made particularly on matters related to the airport. However, 
the question of the recognition of those gains has been left to 
the third countries. Those gains must be effectively guaranteed. 
<H5>  The Original Spirit of the Package </H5>
  The Turkish Cypriot side has stressed at every opportunity 
that it is prepared to discuss the modalities related to the 
application of the package, provided that the problems that 
conflict with the original spirit of that package and the 
promises that have been made to the Turkish Cypriot side are 
resolved. We hope that the UN representatives will maintain a 
sensitive approach for the successful application of the 
agreement that will be reached on the basis of political 
equality. We also hope that they will carefully create and 
protect the sensitive balances that will enable the package to 
satisfy the interests and expectations of the two sides. 
  Within that framework, briefly recalling the UN secretary 
general's report, dated 4 April 1994, will be useful. It 
outlined the Turkish Cypriot side's views on the non-documents. 
That is a positive aspect in that report, regardless of the 
fact that it mentioned the Turkish Cypriot side's views very 
briefly. Another positive aspect is the fact that it pointed to 
the need for the maintenance of the talks. 
  A negative aspect of that report is that it failed to 
mention 
that certain matters that the Turkish Cypriot side cannot accept 
have been included in the non-documents, regardless of the fact 
that they were not included in the original package. What have 
been excluded from and added to the original package constitute 
an unacceptable deviation from the promises that were made to 
the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  I believe that reiterating the following will be useful: The 
Turkish Cypriot side is prepared to hold talks on a package that 
will comply with the original text, spirit, and structure of the 
CBM's package and with the basic principles and concepts in the 
UN secretary general's reports. The Turkish Cypriot side is 
also prepared to submit the final agreement that will be 
achieved after a positive result is attained through the talks 
to the approval of the TRNC Republican Assembly and the Turkish 
Cypriot people.

  [Text] President Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's assistant special envoy to Cyprus, at 1700 
today. Ozker Ozgur, minister of state and deputy prime 
minister, Atay Ahmet Rasit, minister of foreign affairs and 
defense, Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozer Koray, and John 
Paul Kavanagh, adviser to the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, 
attended the meeting. Speaking after the meeting, which 
continued for nearly one hour and 45 minutes, Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] The issue of whether or not the 
situation has changed was discussed. Our position is common 
knowledge. Our question on whether things are still the same on 
the Greek Cypriot side remains unanswered. We reiterated our 
complaints relating to developments on the Greek Cypriot side, 
which have created a difficult atmosphere for the talks on the 
confidence- building measures. An impression has been created 
that preparations for war are being made around us. The Greek 
Cypriots have indicated that they are determined to further the 
agreement they have reached with Greece and that they are taking 
steps in that direction. They have even moved to place joint 
orders with Greece for arms. 
  All these things are dispelling the hope that something can 
be achieved through the confidence-building measures. This is a 
deliberate approach by the Greek Cypriots. And it is due to 
their conviction that concluding an agreement with the Turkish 
Cypriots will degrade and reduce their status. They are 
convinced that they have misled the world into believing that 
Cyprus belongs to them. 
  We have observed that the UN secretary general is trying to 
submit the nondocument placed before us as the UN secretary 
general's document containing his proposals. That too has made 
us uneasy. We cannot agree to that. The nondocument's status 
cannot be changed. Its contents cannot be described as the UN 
secretary general's proposals to the sides. This is because the 
UN secretary general cannot submit binding proposals within the 
framework of his goodwill mission. That has not been 
considered. He does not have that mandate. 
  Yes, we discussed all that. Feissel will come back to 
contact us if he wants to. [end recording] 
  Denktas replied to a correspondent's question after the 
meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified correspondent] The letter to 
be submitted to Butrus Butrus-Ghali refers to the current basis. 
Was the nondocument, which was submitted to the sides on 21 
March, included in that? 
  [Denktas] Yes, that is right. It was suddenly described as 
the final document, one that must not be touched. Glavkos 
Kliridhis said he would agree to that document if it was not 
changed and if Denktas accepted it. The UN secretary general 
has converted the document into a list of proposals that will 
form the basis of the agreement. That is wrong. [end recording]

  [Text] Replying to questions about the U.S. raid in 
Gorazde, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the facts 
are not yet clear. The spokesman also stressed that we must 
seek a just, quick, and viable solution of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina problem based on respect for international 
law and the decisions of international organizations. 
  Replying to another question, Venizelos said Greece was not 
informed of the raid beforehand and added that not every NATO 
country is informed before similar acts. There is no provision 
for any similar process involving deliberations, he said, adding 
that the order was given by Akasi, meaning it was actually an 
order by the UN secretary general.

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou held a scheduled 
meeting with the Yugoslav ambassador this evening. Our 
correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report: 
  [Begin Karzis recording] Good evening from our studios on 
Mourouzis Street. The prime minister's meeting with Ambassador 
of New Yugoslavia [as heard] Milan Milutinovic, which lasted 
approximately 25 minutes, ended few minutes ago in the Maximos 
Palace. Mr. Milutinovic was extremely sparing in his statement 
immediately after the meeting. He said that he had discussed 
the latest developments with the prime minister and that he had 
submitted a message from the Yugoslav Government but he did not 
want to disclose its details. 
  Mr. Milutinovic also did not want to comment on how the 
Serbs 
would react to the bombings from the NATO aircraft in the past 
few days. 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will arrive in Athens 
on Wednesday [13 April] and it is not ruled out that Vladislav 
Jovanovic, the foreign minister of new Yugoslavia, will also 
visit the Greek capital on Friday. 
  We should also note that a short time ago National Defense 
Minister Yerasimos Arsenis said in the most categorical manner 
that no Greek crews would take part in the NATO operations in 
New Yugoslavia. 
  Of course, there is concern in Athens over the latest 
developments on the Bosnian front. The government is following 
these developments closely, as all the parties favor a peaceful 
settlement of the crisis. [end recording]

  [Text] The British aircraft carrier Ark Royal, which was 
anchored in Piraievs last weekend, was to be the third target of 
the 17 November terrorist organziation, which claimed 
responsibility for the attacks against the offices of two 
insurance companies on Kifissia Avenue last night. 
  In a telephone call to a private radio station, 17 November 
stated that it was also going to strike at the aircraft carrier. 
At 1230 today, a passerby accidentally found two 2.3-inch 
rockets in a metal pipe and a firing mechanism on a building 
site along the Miaoulis coast in Piraievs. The rockets were 
defused by explosives experts.

  [Text] Ankara, April 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Monday [11 April] critized the United Nations mechanism 
as being too slow, saying it was the reason why intervention to 
Gorazde had come too late. 
  He was speaking to reporters after a joint press conference 
with visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  Cetin said necessary protection should also be given to 
other 
regions besides Sarajevo, stressing that Turkey had called to 
attention the fact that Gorazde was a "critical" region, before 
the Serbian attacks were intensified. 
  He underlined the fact that Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
should join the agreement signed between Bosnians and Croats, 
adding a healthy future for the Balkans can only be reached with 
the setting up of lasting and just peace. 
  Cetin said Turkey will continue efforts for the 
establishment 
of peace in the region adding talks between Turkish-Bosnian and 
Croatian delegations will be held at the foreign ministers level.

<F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut: "A U.S. State Department Obstacle </F>
Before Ciller"] 
  [Text] The U.S. State Department has opposed the 
possibility of President Clinton meeting Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller when she visits the United States to hold talks with the 
IMF and World Bank officials next week. A high-level U.S. State 
Department memorandum to the White House said: "Considering the 
political and economic developments in Turkey, President 
Clinton's receiving Prime Minister Tansu Ciller twice within a 
short time may convey the wrong message to Turkey. The meeting 
may encourage particular expectations by the Turkish Government, 
expectations that cannot be fulfilled. Considering that the 
United States will be unable to fulfill those expectations, a 
difficult period may emerge in U.S.-Turkish relations." 
  The emergence of such a view in the U.S. Administration only 
a few days before Ciller's visit has surprised experienced 
diplomatic circles in Washington. They have said that the 
difference of opinion shows the unease in the U.S. 
Administration over Ciller's visit. 
  A source close to the U.S. Administration's departments 
concerned with Turkey has said: "The U.S. State Department is 
worried about the Ciller government's future. It has not said 
so but it is worried. We know that particular reports have been 
drawn up within the U.S. Administration predicting that the 
Ciller government will not survive long. So the U.S. State 
Department is worried that President Clinton's meeting with 
Prime Minister Ciller may convey the wrong message to Turkey." 
  In addition to the U.S. State Department, Clinton's closest 
advisers have also opposed his meeting with Ciller. Only 
Jenonne Walker, who is responsible for Turkish affairs on the 
U.S. National Security Council, favored the meeting. Walker 
reportedly supported the meeting because Tansu Ciller is a woman. 
  Reportedly, President Clinton may agree to meet Ciller 
briefly in New York so as not to disappoint her. 
  The U.S. Administration is convinced that Ciller wants to 
meet Clinton to ask him to support her government in removing 
the economic crisis in Turkey. But Clinton can provide no 
tangible aid to Ankara because the U.S. budget does not even 
have one dollar to spare for an additional aid package to Turkey.

  [Text] Ankara, April 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Monday [11 April] said that Turkey has agreed with 
Israel to shoulder the leadership for setting up an organization 
similar to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE) for the Middle East. 
  Cetin was speaking to reporters at a joint press conference 
with his Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres, at the conclusion of 
Turkey-Israel official talks. 
  He said during the talks both countries have agreed on 
Turkey's more active participation to the Middle East peace 
process. 
  Cetin also said that visa applications will not be required 
for Turkish citizens who want to visit Israel, adding that 
Israel will not ask for a visa from Turkish businessmen or from 
those visiting the country for cultural reasons. 
  Stressing the existence of a great cooperation potential 
between the two countries, Cetin said agreements on incitement 
and protection of investments, prevention of double-taxation and 
technological cooperation will be concluded at the soonest. 
  Peres said that Turkey is a country that can play an 
important role in many ways for the future of the Middle East, 
adding his country gives great importance to its relations and 
ties with Ankara. 
  He said that the fact that Turkey is a secular and 
democratic 
Moslem country at the same time having very good relations with 
Israel gives it the possibility of being a "bridge" between 
different cultures. 
  Peres also underlined the possibility for cooperation with 
Turkey and the United States for investments in the Central 
Asian republics. 
  He said that Turkey is the only country with enough water 
for 
its needs in a region where water has become as important as 
oil, adding countries such as his own which are in need of water 
could buy from Turkey and he has discussed this topic with Cetin. 
  On the Israeli pullout from Jericho and the West Bank 
according to an agreement signed earlier between the PLO and 
Israel, Peres said this would only be completed by the end of 
the month. 
  Answering a reporter's question on the use of Turkish waters 
for meeting the needs of the Middle East region, Cetin said 
there exists a number of possibilities. 
  The first posibility is the use of the Manavgat river in the 
Mediterranean Province of Antalya which flows into the sea, by 
collecting its waters for transport to needy Middle Eastern 
countries. 
  The second choice is the transfer of the waters of the 
Euphrates and the Tigris in the southeast, via pipeline to the 
Middle East region. 
  Cetin said Turkey considers its waters as "peace waters" and 
not "conflict waters."

<F P=106> [Report by Gadi Sukenik, political correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Turkey will intercede with the Syrian president to 
arrange for secret contacts between Damascus and Jerusalem. 
This was agreed on in talks held in Ankara today between 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and his Turkish counterpart 
Hikmet Cetin. A giant deal to purchase drinking water from 
Turkey to supply water for the Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza 
Strip was concluded in the course of the visit. Our 
correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports from Ankara: 
  [Begin recording] [Sukenik] All signs indicate that a real 
chemistry has emerged between Israel and Turkey. Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller told Peres this evening that her country will 
become much more involved in our peace process and will 
participate in any international presence in the territories, 
and Peres welcomed her announcement. 
  The Turks will soon waive visas for Israelis and will sign a 
series of cooperation agreements this year, first and foremost, 
concerning a free trade zone with Israel. They are also 
interested in partnership in the gas deal, if it goes through, 
between Israel and Qatar. 
  In their news conference, the two foreign ministers did not 
disclose the contents of their tete-a-tete talks in which it was 
agreed that the Turks would attempt to help arrange secret 
contacts between Israel and Syria, a rather problematic neighbor 
of the Turks as well. 
  I sought comments on this information from the horse's 
mouth, 
Cetin. Incidentally, he believes that Israel will give back the 
Golan in exchange for full peace. 
  [Cetin, in English] We will do our best, and we are doing 
and will do our best in practical and to help. [sentence as 
heard] 
  [Sukenik, in English] Trying to discuss it with the Syrians, 
maybe? 
  [Cetin, in English] Well, at this moment, let's keep it like 
this. We do our best in every arena, in every meeting, in every 
talk, and we will continue to do that. 
  [Sukenik] Water was a key issue in the talks. At stake is 
the purchase of huge quantities of drinking water from Turkey, 
initially through international funding to meet the needs of the 
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and in the second stage to meet 
the needs of the State of Israel. The water would be 
transported by sea, either in tankers or by huge water-borne 
plastic containers known as medusas. 
  Peres pressured the Turks not to suffice with promises on 
the 
water issue. This evening he is scheduled to confer with 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and will return to Israel 
tomorrow. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 
1700 
GMT on 11 April carries a recorded passage from the joint news 
conference held by Cetin and Peres, in which the latter states 
in English: "As I understand, now in Cairo we have agreed that 
the target date will be the end of this month, April. Then, I 
think, there won't be needed much time to implement the 
agreement. The agreement can be implemented in a very short 
while."]

<F P=106> [Statement by Central Bank Governor Yaman Toruner in Ankara </F>
on 11 April 1994 -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Extended Administrative Council of the Turkish 
Union of Banks, the Central Bank, and the Treasury and Foreign 
Trade Undersecretariat held a meeting yesterday, 10 April 1994. 
At the meeting, they stressed that they share the view that the 
economic stability program is the guarantee of the future of 
Turkey's economy. 
  They also determined that there is no liquidity problem in 
terms of either the Turkish lira or foreign exchange in the 
Turkish banking system. They decided to make the system 
liquidity permanent by means of measures to be determined by the 
Turkish Union of Banks and the Central Bank and to be carried 
out by all the banks that are members of the union. 
  The participants at the meeting agreed that publishing the 
recent speculative and unfounded reports in connection with 
certain banks is, to say the least, immoral. They stressed that 
both the Treasury and Foreign Trade Undersecretariat and the 
banks concerned will take legal action in connection with these 
reports.

  [Text] The security forces have found the body of 
Abdulvahap Akar, the chief Prosperity Party [PP] official for 
Igdir Province, who was kidnaped by terrorists a while ago. The 
body was found on the Igdir-Karalik highway. Akar was also the 
PP candidate for mayor in the recent local elections. 
  Meanwhile, one of the terrorists who martyred First 
Lieutenant Cevdet Cifcti while he was on patrol in the city of 
Igdir last month has been caught in Ankara. The terrorist was 
taken to Igdir and arrested. Igdir Governor Semsettin Uzun said 
that this terrorist forced shopkeepers to shut down, extorted 
money for the organization from citizens, and recruited members. 
In searches conducted following his interrogation, the security 
forces found a Kalashnikov rifle. 
  Twelve terrorists were killed in clashes conducted between 
security forces and terrorists in Andac in Sirnak and near Genc 
District in Bingol. Two members of the security forces were

  [Text] [Announcer] The assembly of members of parliament of 
the Council of Europe is news today and will be for the next few 
days. A historic event is taking place today. For the first 
time a delegation of the Bosnian parliament is going to be at 
the Council of Europe assembly, and the new Russian delegation 
will also be attending. Miguel Angel Martinez, president of the 
assembly of members of parliament of the Council of Europe, is 
on the line. Today is an important day for the assembly of 
members of parliament of the Council of Europe. The 
representatives of the Bosnian parliament will be at this 
assembly for the first time. 
  [Martinez] Yes, with the president of the Bosnian parliament 
leading them, they are going to take their place for the first 
time as specially invited guests, that is, a candidate member 
country to affiliation to the Council of Europe. 
  [Announcer] There is also more news. For example, Boris 
Yeltsin is in Spain. Russia, with these problems about the 
Black Sea Fleet, the complaints about not having been informed 
about NATO air strikes around Gorazde, and the new Russian 
delegation taking its place in the assembly of the Council of 
Europe. What do these two developments mean for this 
organization, the assembly of the Council of Europe? 
  [Martinez] What this means is the new role of the Council of 
Europe and the new dimension of the European contruction -- 
which now far surpasses the narrow and almost subregional 
framework of the European Union, the EC, and Europe, now that 
the world divided into blocs is over -- is expanding to all the 
countries, interpreting their aspiration to live in freedom and 
democracy. I refer to the countries on the map of the 
continent. They identify that aspiration with participating in 
the construction of Europe, and here we have important countries 
such as Russia with which, obviously, the dimension of 
construction is growing in terms of countries, of people who are 
going to come under the blue starred flag, and, as you can 
imagine, the complexity of our work increases. 
  [Announcer] There is another important bit of news which 
goes 
slightly beyond Europe's sphere and it is the participation, 
that presence, of Yasir 'Arafat, who is going to be at the 
Council of Europe shortly. Will the Council of Europe have much 
capacity to intervene or support the Middle East peace process? 
  [Martinez] One of the responsibilities practically falling 
on 
us, without us having made any request, is to be Europe's voice 
in dialogue and, if you like, negotiation with the other big 
countries or other big blocs of countries with which, by 
necessity, Europe has to speak to construct the world order and, 
above all, to keep peace in the world. I have just returned 
from China as part of a very high-level delegation. Yesterday I 
saw the U.S. ambassador to France in my office; she was carrying 
a message from President Clinton. Today I am receiving a 
delegation of 15 Arab countries, and tomorrow Yasir 'Arafat is 
coming. Europe must speak, talk. It must be a partner with 
these others to create a world in peace, and naturally it would 
appear that the Council of Europe is the most representative 
instrument because we are all here.

carriers for UN troops in Bosnia has departed from 
Neubrandenburg for Zagreb today. The vehicles from the stocks 
of the former National People's Army were refitted in 
Neubrandenburg (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). A second convoy 
is to follow on Friday [15 April] so that over 169 armored 
personnel carriers and two armored recovery vehicles will be at 
UN disposal. According to those who reequipped the vehicles, 
they will be used by the United Nations on a loan basis. The 
United Nations is responsible for the maintenance and must 
return the vehicles if they are not destroyed.

<F P=106> [Guy de Jonquieres article: "Mood Swings and Trade Winds"] </F>
  [Text] When ministers from more than 120 countries gather 
in Marrakesh, Morocco, next week for a four-day conference of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], they will be 
striving for a show of harmony. But behind the scenes, many 
delegations seem more likely to be scowling at each other. 
  The uncertain mood reflects deep strains in a world trade 
system torn between conflicting impulses. One set is propelling 
economies towards steadily greater interdependence; but another 
threatens to drive them further apart. 
  The cause of closer integration has been powerfully advanced 
by last December's Uruguay Round agreement, which ministers will 
sign next Friday. The most ambitious trade liberalisation deal 
in history, it is expected by some forecasters to enrich the 
world by about $3OO billion annually. 
  Due to take effect next year, the round promises to step up 
the onslaught on economic frontiers which are already crumbling 
under the impact of technological innovation, freer capital 
mobility and instantaneous information flows. 
  However, achieving these gains is likely to prove far from 
painless. The fiercer global competition grows, and the broader 
its impact, the tougher the industrial adjustments it requires. 
As a consequence, many governments face mounting domestic 
pressure to protect threatened interests. One symptom is this 
week's mass protests against the round in India. 
  Still more serious is the threat of a lurch towards more 
aggressive unilateral policies and managed trade, which would 
strike at the basic principles of the GATT system. Its 
persistence has been underlined by the Clinton Administration's 
recently renewed pressure on Japan to open its market further or 
face possible U.S. trade sanctions. 
  Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the GATT, has 
condemned the trend as misguided and dangerous. "A new outbreak 
of bilateral trade tensions is putting the achievements of the 
Uruguay Round to the test even before they are fully 
operational," he said last month. 
  Against this background, it is remarkable that a deal has 
been concluded at all. The more so since recession and 
stubbornly high unemployment in many industrialised countries 
make trade concessions harder to sell at home. 
  As well as cutting tariffs, the round aims progressively to 
free trade in services -- a fifth of total world trade -- 
agriculture, textiles and government procurement. Though 
concrete liberalisation in some of these sectors has yet to be 
agreed, all have for the first time been brought firmly within 
the framework of GATT rules and disciplines. 
  The round has also given birth to a new institution, the 
World Trade Organisation [WTO]. Due to take over from the GATT 
next year, the WTO will have greater authority to adjudicate 
international disputes and is intended as a permanent forum for 
trade negotiations. 
  However, the power of any club to enforce rules is no 
stronger than its members' willingness to respect them. In 
future, attitudes seem likely to be influenced not only by 
swings in the economic cycle, but by a steadily accelerating 
shift in the world's economic centre of gravity to the south and 
east. 
  Since the Uruguay Round was launched in 1986, a wave of 
liberalisation has swept across much of the developing world. 
It has paid off in faster growth and soaring exports, 
particularly of manufactured goods. As the table shows, gains 
in Asia have been particularly striking. 
  The most potent element in the ascendancy of the emerging 
nations is the explosive growth of China which, on recent 
trends, could become the world's largest economy early next 
century. China's weight in international policy will be felt 
well before then if it succeeds in its plans to join the WTO 
this year. 
  It is far from clear that the older industrialised powers 
which have long dominated world trade policy have yet come to 
terms with the implications of these developments. As they 
confront them, international frictions could intensify. One 
risk is of a retreat into protectionism. In several richer 
countries, job losses and declining industrial performance are 
already blamed on "unfair" competition from emerging economies 
with lower costs. 
  Social and political issues may prove another source of 
divisions, to judge by the recent row over U.S. attempts to 
place labour conditions on the WTO agenda. The move has been 
attacked as a protectionist ploy by developing countries, some 
of which openly scorn Western notions of democratic values and 
human rights. 
  However, the fault lines do not only run from north to 
south. 
Relations between the world's biggest trading powers are also 
strained most obviously by continuing bilateral tensions between 
Washington and Tokyo. 
  Dealings between the U.S. and the European Union are marred 
by bickering over specific issues and by more general mutual 
suspicion. This has so far thwarted a common interest in working 
together to try to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Brussels 
remains deeply nervous about Washington's motives, while the 
U.S. decries the EU as cowardly and hypocritical. 
  Underlying this mistrust are growing uncertainties about the 
direction of both powers' future policy. The biggest centre is 
in the United States, where the Clinton Administration has 
embraced a neo-mercantilist approach giving priority to 
government-backed promotion of exports and selected industrial 
sectors. 
  "U.S. attitudes are undergoing a sea-change," says an 
international trade policy expert. One recent manifestation was 
the administration's decisive role in the $6 billion sale of 
Boeing airliners to Saudi Arabia. Another was its retreat from 
earlier demands that the Uruguay Round restrict government 
subsidies because it wanted the freedom to support U.S. 
high-tech industries. 
  The export drive has added impetus to attempts to prise open 
foreign markets. As impatience for quick results grows, U.S. 
officials are increasingly disposed to view unilateral measures 
as preferable to the often slow and unwieldy mechanisms of the 
GATT. 
  To its supporters the approach is a robustly practical 
defence of national interest. To its critics, who include many 
other GATT members, it amounts to bully-boy tactics which 
threaten to replace multilateral trade rules with the law of the 
jungle. 
  Across the Atlantic, the balance is more delicately poised. 
Fears of a "Fortress Europe" have proved overdone. Yet France's 
readiness last year to take the Uruguay Round to the brink over 
farm trade underlines the fragility of the EU consensus. 
  That it has remained intact and broadly liberal is due 
partly 
to the influence of Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner. 
But his successors may not be as committed to upholding free 
trade. If the United States drifted further towards 
unilateralism, the task might prove impossible. 
  It is, however, by no means certain that will happen. 
Optimists point out that the Clinton Administration, while 
talking tough, has shrunk from pushing bilateral disagreements 
to the point of crisis. 
  Furthermore, the Uruguay Round will meet U.S. criticisms of 
GATT disputes procedures by speeding them up. It will also curb 
use of unilateral weapons, such as U.S. section Super-301 trade 
sanctions, though Washington claims it will still have the right 
to invoke Super 301 in certain conditions. 
  But probably the strongest safeguard of the integrity of the 
multilateral trade system lies in the changed attitudes of 
emerging economies. Once suspicious of GATT as a tool of 
Western capitalist exploitation, many now see it as a guarantee 
of their national interests. 
  "At the start of the Uruguay Round, countries such as Brazil 
were still focusing heavily on a defensive third world agenda," 
says a Western diplomat in Geneva. "By the end, they were much 
more eager to press ahead with liberalisation of trade." 
  As well as keeping markets open for their exports, GATT 
disciplines provide their governments with useful leverage to 
push through politically controversial reforms at home. 
  The fact that these countries are also among the world's 
fastest-growing markets should, at least, give pause for thought 
to industrialised powers wavering in their commitment to 
multilateral trade policies. That, however, seems unlikely to 
prevent further stresses and strains between GATT's members. On 
recent evidence, the road from Marrakesh will prove no less 
tortuous than the one leading up to it.

<F P=106> [Article signed ABS (ADB): "Big Increase in BLEU-China </F>
Trade in a Difficult Context"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 6 Apr (BELGA) -- Belgian 
(Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union [BLEU])-Chinese foreign trade 
increased by 21.5 percent in the first 10 months of 1993 
according to figures published by the Belgian-Chinese Economic 
and Commercial Council (CECBC). 
  The total volume of imports by the BLEU was 12.4 billion 
Belgian francs [BFr] from January to October 1993, as against 
BFr10.9 billion for the 10 corresponding months of 1992 (up 13.6 
percent). The total volume of exports by the BLEU to China for 
the same period was BFr20.5 billion, compared with BFr10.6 
billion (up 94 percent). At the end of October 1992, the 
balance of trade was around BFr300 million in China's favor. 
One year later, it was BFr8.1 billion in the BLEU's favor. 
  The BLEU's performance is particularly striking because the 
total trade between the European Union and China shows a deficit 
to the detriment of the Twelve. 
  In 1993, the BLEU exported mainly machinery and electrical 
equipment (worth BFr8.9 billion, in other words a trebling), 
base metals (worth more than BFr3.6 billion, in other words four 
times as much), chemical products (worth almost BFr2.5 billion, 
in other words a drop of 40 percent), and plastics (BFr629 
million, in other words a drop of 30 percent). The Chinese 
exported to the BLEU mainly textile products (BFr3.8 billion, in 
other words an increase of 80 percent), chemical products 
(BFr1.5 billion, in other words an increase of 17 percent), 
vegetable and food products (BFr1.2 billion, in other words a 
drop of 38 percent), and minerals (1.1 billion, in other words a 
drop of 1.7 percent). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["LNS" report on interview with Belgian Foreign Minister </F>
Claes in Brussels; date not given: "Minister Claes Does Not 
Expect UN Mandate in Rwanda To Be Extended"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Foreign Minister Willy Claes does not 
expect the Security Council to extend the mandate of UN troops 
in Rwanda. "A debate in New York is inevitable," he said 
yesterday on television. He recalled that the UN troops were 
sent to Rwanda to help realize the implementation of the Arusha 
peace agreement. The murder of President Habyarimana has made 
the further existence of the agreement doubtful. 
  Claes expected the United Nations to be very reluctant to 
grant another extension of the mandate. He emphasized that the 
Belgian soldiers in Rwanda would not intervene. 
  "The UN soldiers are remaining within their mandate as 
peacekeepers, the paratroopers who went there have a clear 
humanitarian mission," the minister said on "The Seventh Day" 
television news program yesterday. 
  Claes left no doubt about the need to send Belgian troops to 
Rwanda. "At the time both the president and the rebels asked us 
to send troops. The United Nations also urged us to send 
soldiers, because our UN troops have a good reputation," the 
minister said, admitting that the mandate and the arming of the 
UN troops could have been better. The minister thought it was 
correct that the Belgian UN troops had not intervened in recent 
days. 
  They do not have antitank artillery and interference in the 
internal disputes would unavoidably lead to revenge attacks on 
whites. 
  "The hostility of part of the presidential guard against the 
Belgians was due to the impartiality of Belgium, which supported 
the peace agreement and never chose sides," Claes said. 
  "We have always told both sides that they must respect human 
rights," he said. "I would also note that the anti-Belgian 
attitude comes from extremists only."

  [Text] The Prime Minister today backed United Nations 
commanders who ordered a NATO air strike against Bosnian Serbs 
besieging the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. Two U.S. NATO F16 jets 
bombed a Bosnian Serb artillery command post near Gorazde, a 
designated "safe haven," yesterday after the Serbs ignored 
repeated warnings to stop attacks on the town. 
  The strike was fully justified, John Major said during a 
visit to Birmingham. "It makes it perfectly clear to the Serbs 
or to anyone else that we are serious about making sure that 
United Nations Security Council resolutions are kept," he said. 
  "I think the air strikes were justified -- they were 
certainly within the authority which the commanders on the 
ground have. They saw continued approach towards Goradze. 
They saw the shelling of Goradze. The Serbs were given a clear 
warning to stop. They didn't stop and I think they can be 
unsurprised at the subsequent action." 
  Asked how much notice he was given about the air strike, Mr 
Major said: "It isn't a matter of anyone being given notice. 
The responsibility for this has been delegated to the 
Secretary General who has delegated to the commanders on the 
ground and it is for them to make the decisions, and not for the 
politicians a long way away." 
  He went on: "The changes which we have seen in Bosnia in 
the last two months have been astonishing. We have moved at a 
rapid rate towards the possibility of an overall settlement now 
and that is being put in danger by what has happened in Goradze. 
I have not a shred of doubt that the commanders on the ground 
were right to act as they did."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus </F>
Kinkel by unidentified correspondent--live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is 
expected in Bonn today for a two-day working visit. During the 
visit, Butrus-Ghali wants to ensure that Germany increases its 
political, military, and financial contribution to the United 
Nations. The secretary general wants, for example, a standing 
rapid deployment force. About 20 states should each supply 2000 
troops, which can be placed under UN command within one week. 
  I now welcome Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on the telephone 
from Bonn. Good morning, Mr. Kinkel. 
  [Kinkel] Good morning, Mr. [name indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] In a newspaper interview, Butrus-Ghali 
presented quite detailed ideas. To quote him, he said we will 
ask Germany for, at most, 1 percent of its armed forces for 
possible participation in missions. How will you respond to 
this request? 
  [Kinkel] Well, first we need a constitutional amendment, to 
which I am sorry to say the Social Democratic Party [SPD] has 
offered enormous resistance up to now. I am also very 
interested in how Mr. Scharping will defend this today in 
Washington in his talks with the president. As long as we have 
no constitutional amendment--for which we can at present only 
wait again for a decision from the Federal Constitutional Court, 
and in April we have a public hearing in Karlsruhe--as long as 
we have no such decision, we need not and cannot give specific 
consideration to the requests and ideas of the secretary 
general. It is obvious that we are interested as a coalition 
and as a government not only in obtaining our rights within the 
United Nations, but also in performing our duties to the United 
Nations in the future--also with regard to the provision of 
soldiers for UN blue helmet and other missions. We will 
certainly not leave the secretary general in the lurch on this. 
I cannot say anything specific to him on this at the moment, 
however. 
  [Correspondent] What is your view, in principle, of the plan 
for a rapid intervention force to be placed permanently at the 
disposal of the UN secretary general? 
  [Kinkel] It is an idea that has been considered for some 
time, not only by the secretary general himself but also by the 
United Nations. At present, the situation is that the UN 
secretary general has to go around to the countries cap-in-hand 
for every mission and must ask who is willing to participate 
under very specific conditions. There is, of course, something 
to be said for this, but there is something against it. I do 
not think this idea is wrong as such, and we have quite positive 
views on it, too. I would not like to commit myself now on 
behalf of the German Government because it is simply too early. 
We will, as I say, not leave the secretary general in the lurch. 
  [Correspondent] What can Germany's contribution to the 
United 
Nations look like in the future? 
  [Kinkel] Well, first of all, we are the third-largest 
contributor at the moment. Furthermore, the actions of the 
United Nations do not consist solely of peacekeeping or 
peacemaking [preceding two words in English] actions, but the 
United Nations concerns itself with overpopulation, with famine, 
with the problem of disadvantaged children--UNICEF--and so on. 
We participate in this in a huge way and are making quite a 
considerable contribution, so we have not had to hide our light 
under a bushel up to now. What we have not been able to do up 
to now is to take part in peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts; 
that will require an amendment to the Basic Law. 
  [Correspondent] Yesterday, Mr. Kinkel, the German United 
Nations Association advised against insisting on a seat for 
Germany on the Security Council. The reason they gave was that 
otherwise there is the danger that an expanded Council would 
become incapable of action. Would the German Government be 
better advised to drop its wish for a seat in the Security 
Council? 
  [Kinkel] No. Nor do I understand how such a view came to be 
expressed there. In all opinion surveys, some 75 percent of the 
population support the intention of the government and the 
coalition to seek such a seat, and the figure is rising. By the 
way, it was not the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] or the Free Democratic Party [FDP], but the SPD 
that was the first to call for a seat. Beginning in 1995, we 
want a nonpermanent seat in the Security Council because it is 
our turn again in the rotation, and we would like [passage 
indistinct]. 
  It is not a matter of adding only Germany and Japan to the 
Security Council. That is not the demand at all. The discussion 
only arose after Third World countries quite rightly said that 
the current composition of the Security Council does not reflect 
the world situation but is the result of World War II. The fact 
is that the German demand is understood and supported wherever 
you look. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, yesterday the United Nations 
carried out air strikes on Serb positions near Gorazde for the 
second time within 24 hours. How strongly does the German 
Government support these attacks? 
  [Kinkel] Completely. What happened there yesterday and the 
day before yesterday is based on Security Council Resolution 836 
and is thus covered in UN terms, as it were, and is also covered 
in NATO terms. The fundamental decisions were made last year, 
the decisions to defend the safe areas laid down by the United 
Nations by using force against force if necessary, as it were. 
The measures taken yesterday and the day before yesterday were 
slightly different. In that case, UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] observers were put at risk by Serb shelling; therefore, 
NATO was called on to help. The measures were right, necessary, 
and justified. 
  [Correspondent] What will happen if the Serb attacks on 
Gorazde continue? 
  [Kinkel] If the Serb attacks on Gorazde continue--and I hope 
they will not because I would like to think that the Serbs must 
know that the United Nations and NATO will not accept this--but 
if they should continue, as Mr. Woerner said yesterday, we will 
have to do something and consider whether an ultimatum will 
possibly have to be announced in line with what happened in 
Sarajevo. However, this is not on the agenda at present. Of 
course, we have to make sure that matters do not escalate. I 
have always been in favor, and now even more so, of always 
involving the Russians. 
  [Correspondent] Do you expect Moscow to raise objections to 
further air strikes carried out by NATO or the United Nations? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, there certainly will be objections. [words 
indistinct] (?Russia cannot be allowed simply to impose a veto 
on such actions, which are necessary, which have been decided 
upon and are covered by law). However, this has nothing to do 
with.... [pauses] I would like to emphasize this: that 
everything possible must be done to include the Russians, and 
this has always been our policy. [words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] During your meeting with Butrus-Ghali today, 
will you and Chancellor Kohl also be raising Germany's wish that 
UN institutions be established in Bonn? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, I will be. I have done this persistently in 
the past, and I will do it again today. We want appropriate UN 
institutions to be located in Germany, and particularly in Bonn. 
The secretary general is familiar with our request. I have 
talked to him about it on several occasions. Incidentally, this 
is his third visit to Bonn. We will, of course, again raise the 
matter of making Hamburg the headquarters of the International 
Maritime Court. These are our wishes, and I hope that UN 
institutions of one kind or another will come here to Bonn. 
  [Correspondent] The last question, Mr. Kinkel. You are also 
the FDP's federal chairman. The presidium yesterday specified 
that it would form future coalitions with the CDU. Juergen 
Moellemann, the FDP chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia, said 
this morning that the FDP federal party conference in Rostock 
would have to state more precisely its coalition intentions. He 
said that, on the one hand, key issues should be explained. 
Second, he said you should opt for a coalition with the CDU 
only if the election result produces this. Will the FDP leave 
itself a way out so that it can form a coalition with the SPD 
after the Bundestag election? 
  [Kinkel] The proposal I made yesterday and the decision made 
by the FDP were quite clear. We will wait and see what happens 
at the meeting of the FDP federal executive and the party 
conference in Rostock. I would not like to comment on this 
matter beforehand.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe has justified as "absolutely necessary" the attacks 
carried out by NATO combat aircraft on Serbian positions on 
behalf of the United Nations. It was obvious that the Serbs 
would only understand "this clear language," Ruehe said in an 
interview with the daily DIE WELT (Tuesday [12 April] edition). 
A "human catastrophe on an immense scale" was beginning to 
emerge in Gorazde. Now everybody has to exert an influence on 
the Serbs to stop their attacks. Russia could also continue to 
play an important role in this process, the minister stressed in 
the article, which was released in advance of publication by the 
Federal Defense Ministry. 
  Hitherto the United Nations has had neither the legal nor 
the 
practical opportunities to actively disarm the Serb besiegers. 
It is therefore all the more important now to exploit all the 
opportunities in Bosnia, "where the United Nations could fall 
back on NATO's resources." This means military air operations 
in particular, Ruehe said. Neither the civilian population nor 
UN troops must come to harm during this. Ruehe once again 
stressed that the deployment of German soldiers in the former 
Yugoslavia will "not be considered" for historical reasons.

  [Excerpts] The situation in Bosnia: things are somewhat 
calmer this evening in Gorazde. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this evening that the 
allies would not retreat when faced with provocations or attacks 
in Bosnia, wherever they came from. Alain Juppe spoke to Alain 
Pages of Radio France Bordeaux-Gironde: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] The resolutions of the Security 
Council and the decisions of the alliance are very clear: they 
authorize UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] to ask for the use of 
air strikes when it believes that our soldiers on the ground are 
under threat. These conditions were fulfilled in Gorazde. 
  If the conditions that occurred in Gorazde should, alas, 
happen again, if UNPROFOR is attacked, if one side or another, 
let us say the Serbs, do not respect the decisions taken by the 
United Nations, then of course air strikes must be used. We 
must make it clear that we shall not retreat when faced with 
provocations and attacks. [end recording]

  [Text] Before ending this bulletin we return to the story 
with which we began -- the bombing of Serb positions near 
Gorazde by NATO planes. The Foreign Ministry has told Spanish 
Television that this bombing was of a limited warning nature and 
has the support of the Spanish Government, which is always in 
favor of UN resolutions being fulfilled. We have just received 
some statements made by Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas, 
who, apart from confirming Spanish support for NATO's action, 
said that the Spanish soldiers serving with the United Nations 
are in no danger. The Spanish soldiers are fulfilling their 
missions with complete normality away from the bombing. 
  [Begin Vargas recording] Therefore, what has been done is to 
extend to that town the threat that was issued at the time for 
Sarajevo, although in the latter case at the last moment it was 
not necessary to carry out the threat. I think this was a 
correct decision and shows that the United Nations is adamant 
that the agreements should be respected, the resolutions should 
be applied, and that the conflict bit by bit should be 
channelled along the road of negotiation. It is a combination 
of negotiation supported by force. And I repeat that the most 
important way is the political way, the way of negotiation, but 
if at times it has to be reinforced with the use of force then I 
think that this is reasonable. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] A strange conflict took place at dawn yesterday 
on the Greek-Albanian border and inside Albanian territory. As 
a result of the conflict, two Albanian soldiers died and three 
others were injured. 
  The Albanian authorities hastened to attribute 
responsibility 
to the Greek Government through a very strong protest demarche. 
The government issued a statement late last night rejecting the 
demarche and categorically stating that the Greek authorities 
have nothing whatsoever to do with the incident which they 
describe as a provocation. 
  Following a telephone call by an unidentified person, a 
leaflet by the MAVI [Metopo Apelevtherosis Voriou Ipirou--North 
Epirus Liberation Front] organization reached the ELEVTHEROTIPIA 
offices claiming responsibility for this conflict. [passage 
omitted] 
  The MAVI leaflet (dated January 1994), which was sent to 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA yesterday, notes the following as a reason for 
yesterday's attack: 
  ``...[ellipses as published] North Epirus, one step away 
from 
Mother Greece, has become desolate and ruined, it is abandoned 
even by the North Epirotes themselves, who live in our country 
under miserable conditions--exploited, deprived of all rights, 
without even being granted residence permits and without free 
communication with their ancestral land. 
  ``The Greek state's criminal indifference is the best gift 
to 
the Albanian chauvinistic plans which aim at the annihilation of 
the Greek element and its final expulsion from the ancestral 
land of North Epirus. This indifference is covered up by the 
systematic `conspiracy of silence' which has condemned our 
national issue to oblivion and our North Epirote brothers into 
fatalism. 
  ``In our desire to suppress this disastrous spirit about the 
land of North Epirus, we have proceeded with the reconstitution 
of the heroic MAVI (North Epirus Liberation Front) and we have 
struck against a fully armed Albanian border guard post....''

<F P=106> [Elisa Wasch report on news conference by Iranian Foreign </F>
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in Austria on 11 April -- recorded; 
Velayati statements in Persian with superimposed German 
translation] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati is currently visiting Austria. Today he had a talk 
with Foreign Minister Mock. According to the assessment of the 
two ministers, the relations between Austria and Iran are very 
good. After the talk, Foreign Minister Velayati gave a news 
conference and Elisa Wasch asked him about the human rights 
situation in Iran. 
  [Wasch] Iran is not precisely regarded as the supreme 
guardian of human rights. The Iranian authorities persecute the 
opponents of the Islamic regime with great severity. 
Consequently, the UN Human Rights Commission has condemned 
Iran. The United Nations specifically objects to the large 
number of executions, the torture of prisoners, and the fact 
that defendants are often unable to defend themselves in court. 
Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati is simply denying 
that these human rights violations exist. 
  [Velayati] This is certainly not the truth. If the 
Americans had solved their problems with us and if they had not 
had any problems with us, we would certainly not have had such 
problems as human rights violations and the Americans would not 
have mentioned human rights violations in Iran. 
  Who does not know that very good U.S. allies in our region 
are committing the worst human rights violations, which, 
however, are not discussed -- for example, Israel? But this is 
not mentioned anywhere. 
  [Wasch] Last year, the Iranian Government did not permit the 
UN special envoy for human rights to enter the country. Asked 
about the reason for this, Foreign Minister Velayati said: 
  [Velayati] We are convinced that he is a henchman of these 
governments and that his position on this issue is not objective. 
  [Wasch] Writer Salman Rushdie, who was sentenced to death in 
Iran for his allegedly heretic book Satanic Verses, will be 
honored in Austria in the near future. He will be awarded the 
Austrian State Prize for European literature. However, Iranian 
Foreign Minister Velayati does not believe that this will put a 
strain on the relations between Austria and Iran. The Austrian 
Government has nothing to do with the decision of the jury that 
awarded the prize to Salman Rushdie, he said. However, 
according to Velayati, it is not possible to set aside the death 
sentence for Salman Rushdie. A religious sentence will always 
remain valid, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Theo </F>
Sommer; place and date not given: "Europe Must Not Become a 
Loser"] 
  [Text] [Sommer] Mr. Chancellor, what belongs together is 
gradually coming together in Europe. Are you satisfied with the 
results of Austria's European Union [EU] membership negotiations? 
  [Vranitzky] I am satisfied with the result of the membership 
negotiations. We stood our ground and realized our objectives 
in virtually all the fields of particular importance to us. The 
transit treaty in its present form is actually an improvement of 
the original version. Therefore, one can tell the Tiroleans 
with reason and good conscience that they have won something. 
In addition, the transit treaty provides for the speedy 
alternative of rail transportation, in many places underground, 
including the Brenner Pass tunnel. And our farmers are well 
off. Bavarian Minister President Stoiber visited us recently. 
He said that, after the conclusion of our negotiations, he now 
has to explain to his mountain farmers why Austrian mountain 
farmers are treated better. 
  [Sommer] How friendly are the Austrians toward Europe after 
the conclusion of the negotiations? If the referendum were held 
tomorrow.... 
  [Vranitzky] ...we would have a majority of positive votes. 
  [Sommer] The referendum will be held in June, and the 
parliament will deal with the treaty in May? 
  [Vranitzky] Our treaty has already been submitted to the 
parliament here. However, we have to wait for final adoption 
until the European Parliament has made a decision. Its final 
deadline is 4 May. 
  [Sommer] Since the last elections in three of your provinces 
the question has sometimes been asked whether a radical domestic 
policy change in Austria is imminent that might run counter to 
your willingness to become a member. What importance should be 
attached to the anti-European factor, Haider? 
  [Vranitzky] One has to start with the knowledge that both 
the political prerequisites and the election results in the 
three provinces were quite different. By the way, Haider's 
attitude has resulted in the formation of blocs in the Freedom 
Party of Austria [FPOe]; many people in the party take an 
absolutely positive view of integration. Provincial 
organizations in individual provinces will dissociate themselves 
from Haider as party chairman; today nobody can tell yet whether 
Haider will decide in favor of or against EU membership in the 
end. 
  [Sommer] Does the question of Austrian neutrality still play 
a role in connection with entry into the EU? 
  [Vranitzky] Insofar as more than 50 percent of our people 
are in favor of maintaining neutrality. 
  [Sommer] Even after the end of the Cold War and the 
confrontation of the blocs in Europe? 
  [Vranitzky] Even after these developments. One must neither 
underestimate nor ignore the emotional value [of neutrality]. 
For a country that was involved in either war or civil war, 
occupied, or otherwise disrupted until about 1955, it has 
primarily to do with the attainment of independence and 
identity. Therefore, I am particularly glad that we have found 
a consensus with the EU members by our clear declaration that we 
also want and are able to participate in the development of a 
European security system on the basis of our neutrality. 
  [Sommer] You will participate in the development of an EU 
security policy identity? 
  [Vranitzky] That's right. Neutrality is not affected by a 
joint security policy. This is also the reason we have not 
abandoned neutrality overnight. As soon as a visible and 
recognizable European security system is developed, it will also 
be possible to discuss neutrality far more calmly in this 
country. 
  [Sommer] Austria is not considering closer involvement with 
NATO or even becoming a NATO member, which is desired by many 
Central European countries? 
  [Vranitzky] We are indeed not discussing NATO membership. 
  [Sommer] But you would not rule out membership in the 
Western European Union, either associate status or as a full 
member? 
  [Vranitzky] I would not rule it out. 
  [Sommer] How will Austria change after entry? What will you 
get? What will be made easier for you? 
  [Vranitzky] I start with the premise that today Austria is 
already one of the most integrated countries in the field of 
economy and commerce. We transact two-thirds of our trade with 
EU countries. This share is far higher than the share of many 
EU members. 
  It is also undeniable that the development of the single 
market will result in disadvantages for those who do not belong 
to it. The longer it takes, the more this disadvantage will 
increase. 
  Moreover, in the so-called European treaties, the EU 
concluded free trade agreements with the Visegrad states that 
are in this way better off than us. These disadvantages cannot 
be eliminated in another way than by our entry. That is to say 
that we will formalize a very intensive relationship and 
eliminate disadvantages from one moment to the other by our 
entry. 
  [Sommer] How must the EU change if the present round of 
enlargement is to be successful and, in addition, one aims at 
further expansion to the east? 
  [Vranitzky] The political voting mechanisms should become 
more conclusive and gain in substance. The EU is now reaching a 
new dimension, the next substantive step. The enforcement of 
certain principles of order is no longer at issue here. Rather, 
it must be important to jointly develop structural measures, 
politically resolve them, and then implement them. 
  [Sommer] Do you also feel that there is a lack of 
democracy in the Community? 
  [Vranitzky] From the point of view of someone who is still 
an outsider, one certainly has to show understanding for the 
fact that countries with functioning parliamentary democracies 
on a national level also do not want to do without a functioning 
parliamentary democracy at the level of integration. 
  [Sommer] Some people have lately voiced the fear that the 
enlargement by Austria and Scandinavia will "Germanize" the old 
Community and an imbalance in favor of the north might replace 
the imbalance in favor of the south, about which many are 
complaining today. The original European Community was a 
Carolingian community. Now a piece is being added to it. 
  [Vranitzky] A combination of Kaiser Wilhelm and Metternich 
or something of that sort. 
  [Sommer] From the point of view of history, one could say 
that a Habsburg element is being added. Romans, Germans, and 
Slavs will be unified in the future Europe. 
  [Vranitzky] If the EU is to truly integrate, it probably has 
to be expected that other elements yet to be historically 
defined will be added. 
  [Sommer] The idea of a EU with 24 or even 30 members does 
not worry you? 
  [Vranitzky] No. Then we will certainly have to basically 
consider the institutions. The statutes of the club will have 
to be different if the number of the club members increases that 
much. I do not assert that everything will be simpler then. 
The challenges will increase. However, if we reduce the idea 
of integration to its original idea, that is, to establish 
security and peace, this objective has already been reached in 
the present circle of members. It has become inconceivable for 
one to aim a gun at the other again. There is no justification 
whatsoever for stopping at borders when this objective is 
pursued. 
  [Sommer] Will the next group enter the EU en bloc like the 
countries of the European Free Trade Association now? Or will 
readiness for entry have to be judged more according to the 
individual capacity of the candidate countries? 
  [Vranitzky] It is not easy to predict. However, there seems 
to be a trend toward individualization. But I believe that we 
will be busy with the expansion to the east in the next decade. 
  [Sommer] What is your concept of the future EU? Will it be 
a confederation? A federal state? Or, as the Constitutional 
Court in Karlsruhe said, a union of states? 
  [Vranitzky] Provided that this debate is not primarily an 
academic one, I believe that what we call federalism in a 
national state is probably the most obvious model. This would 
also be in line with the subsidiarity principle according to 
Maastricht. 
  [Sommer] Will the EU become a big bloc in addition to the 
two big blocs that are already beginning to appear now, that is, 
the North American and the Asian-Japanese? And do you 
anticipate confrontations or cooperation between these 
structures? 
  [Vranitzky] I do not like to use the word "bloc" because, on 
the one hand, it expresses monopolization and, on the other, it 
might confirm the reproach that Europe is developing into the 
"fortress of Europe." European integration is to create a 
certain framework of order and rules of behavior; it is to 
formulate and implement policies without restricting peoples or 
individuals. The first challenge would be to guarantee these 
areas. 
  The second challenge is to come to an understanding with the 
rest of the world beyond these forms of integration. For 
example, in the economically very successful Asian countries 
there are certain views of social standards, the standard of 
living, individual rights, human rights, and democracy rights 
that do not correspond to ours. The danger that I see is if 
these different views are used to strengthen competitiveness in 
competition with other areas. Thus, if some Asian states say 
coolly and bluntly: "We do not want to achieve a living 
standard such as that of the Europeans because we think that the 
defense of it over decades is too difficult," we are worlds 
apart in this respect. However, we have to take care that, in 
this division of the world, Europe does not permanently lose, 
which is currently beginning to show to a certain extent. 
  [Sommer] Do you think we in Europe again capable of offering 
work to our people without reducing our standard of living, our 
social standard? 
  [Vranitzky] Even though we in Europe currently anticipate 
the first signs of an economic stimulation and are delighted by 
it, one must clearly state: If a basic problem is that the 
strengthening of Europe's competitiveness means almost 
exclusively a reduction of jobs in industry and the industrial 
environment, there are not enough alarm bells ringing in Europe 
because the next aspect of such a development would be a threat, 
a danger to the present standards of our social security. 
Certainly the answer cannot be in the reduction of the European 
income level. 
  [Sommer] We cannot adopt the hourly wages of southern China. 
  [Vranitzky] Precisely. And the answer cannot be the 
reduction of social security either, if only because for 
humanitarian reasons. The answers that one must find and give 
lie in overcoming what I would call the third industrial 
revolution. We have to become the new leader in technology, 
production, finding markets, cooperation, and systems 
engineering through research, development, education, training, 
and the best possible mobilization of human capital. 
  [Sommer] Can the economy achieve that on its own or does it 
need the state's protective or even guiding hand for it? 
  [Vranitzky] This question is essential. I am firmly 
convinced that the economy needs support from the state. The 
very clever question was once asked: How much of the state does 
the market need? Politicians have to define the answer to it 
always anew. Meanwhile, even the most committed market economy 
experts realize that the market or the market economy cannot 
work without a certain guiding network, a network of state 
management and services. 
  [Sommer] What will thousand-year-old Austria bring to 
Europe in the way of historical experience? 
  [Vranitzky] We must ensure that with the process of reform 
and the restoration of democracy that is underway in the former 
communist states, the European West and my country in particular 
do not turn away from the reform states for political reasons or 
isolate those states permanently. 
  What I mean by that is: When, following parliamentary 
elections in those reform countries, a political grouping is 
formed that does not correspond exactly to our Western model, we 
distance ourselves. That should not be the case. I fear that 
the Western democracies will not be able to choose what 
preferences and priorities our brothers and sisters in the east 
develop. 
  Furthermore, now that there is a glimmer of hope that the 
armed conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be brought to an end, 
one must support efforts that really will seen an end to the 
conflict. However, we already have to start thinking about what 
will happen after the conflict: What would we do to assist in 
the reconstruction of these regions that have been destroyed? 
How will we overcome the isolation of those who are currently 
outcasts? 
  [Sommer] Whom do you mean? The Serbs? 
  [Vranitzky] For example. One must in general give the 
postcommunist countries a chance to develop a new mentality, a 
chance to transform their own systems. There are some who 
believe that free market economy evidently cannot be created in 
Ukraine. That is why there is a distancing from Ukraine. 
However, without a basic readiness on our part for cooperation, 
Ukraine will not be able to develop a free market economy. Also 
those who have a bad record on human rights are kept at arm's 
length. We must win them over to treating human rights in the 
way that we decide within the CSCE [Council for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe] or the European Council. We should not 
always say: "We do not want to have anything at all to do with 
you," but "we would like to have something to do with you, but 
create the appropriate conditions." 
  [Sommer] As Foreign Minister Mock put it, Austria lies on 
the edge of a storm zone. You have mentioned Ukraine. Vienna 
is closer to the Ukrainian border than to the city of Bregenz. 
In the north, you witnessed how Czechoslovakia fell apart after 
75 years. On your southern border, you have witnessed how 
Yugoslavia has fallen apart. 
  [Vranitzky] The statistics of European wars shows clearly 
that most wars arose as a result of threats in southern and East 
Europe. That is why European integration is so important: 
Europe must treat the task of achieving peace in a courageous 
and resolute manner, even if this venture will undoubtedly take 
years and decades and in some respects appears to be impossible 
today. However, utopias were on very many occasions the engine 
of development, not restrictions, limitations. 
  [Sommer] During the EU negotiations in Brussels, cooperation 
between Bonn and Vienna was very good. 
  [Vranitzky] Yes. 
  [Sommer] During our thousand-year-old relationship, we have 
experienced some happy periods and some unhappy ones. What will 
be the hallmarks of this new phase in Austrian-German relations? 
  [Sommer] I believe that the qualitative element in future 
politics will involve introducing historical and cultural 
relations into a common Europe in a way that will always make it 
possible to cultivate and develop other relations. 
  We have an existing historical and cultural relationship 
between Germany and Austria. However, the wisdom and art of 
politics, above all in view of the relationship, must involve 
developing new, promising relations.

<F P=106> [Thomas Mayer report on interview with European Parliament </F>
Deputy Yiannis Sakellariou; place and date not given: "Huge 
Majority for Austria"] 
  [Text] "I assume that a huge majority of deputies will 
support Austrian European Union [EU] accession." This was 
stated by Yiannis Sakellariou, one of the most important 
deputies in the European Parliament (EP) from Austria's point of 
view, in an interview with DER STANDARD on Thursday [7 April]. 
According to the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany 
official--who is of Greek descent--"85-90 percent of the 
deputies welcome the enlargement." 
  In the EP's Foreign Policy Committee, Sakellariou is 
"rapporteur" on Austria's EU entry -- that is, he is responsible 
for working out all legal questions. 
  Only two weeks ago, he was rather pessimistic as a result of 
the EU internal controversy on the blocking minority and the 
British stalemate on the issue. The EP would "certainly not 
have supported" a de facto lowering of the veto threshold in the 
Council, Sakellariou said. Yet now, "the last hurdle" has been 
overcome. 
  Sakellariou now believes that the only remaining possibility 
for a failure of the vote on Austrian accession is that there 
might not be a "quorum" in the EP on 4 May. The quorum requires 
the presence of more than half of all deputies, at least 260 of 
the 518. 
  Even if he regards it as unlikely that such an "embarrassing 
situation" might really occur in view of a decision that is of 
such significance for the Union, one will have to try very hard 
to call the European deputies to Strasbourg. 
  "After all, there are insecurities," Sakellariou said. "More 
than one-third of the deputies will resign from parliament after 
the 12 June European election." It is hard to anticipate how 
many of them will meet their political obligation. 
  Moreover, there are differing situations in the various 
countries. The majority of the Italian Eurodeputies have 
meanwhile lost their party, "because these parties have ceased 
to exist." One day before the vote on enlargement, national 
elections will be held in the Netherlands. There is, of course, 
great interests for them "among our colleagues from the 
Netherlands." Regional elections will be held in Britain. 
Despite many imponderabilities, Sakellariou is optimistic that 
some 350 deputies will show up. 
  In the EP there are obviously no problems on substance 
regarding Austria's accession that might point to a negative 
vote. A motion for a resolution, which has widely been 
completed by the Foreign Policy Committee, and which should be 
adopted along with the membership resolution assesses as 
"absolutely positive" the result of the negotiations in Brussels. 
  Particular mention is made of the "historic effects of the 
enlargement for Austria and the Union." Austria is expected to 
be "a faithful partner" in the Union.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans-Georg Heinrich, political scientist at </F>
the University of Vienna and a member of the Moscow 
"Parliamentary Center" who worked for in the White House in 
Moscow for three years, by Werner Pirker; place and date not 
given: "Between Compromise and Crash"] 
  [Text] [Pirker] An Austrian in Khasbulatov's empire -- is 
this not a slightly bizarre picture? 
  [Heinrich] I was not classified so easily in political 
terms. I did not belong to the Khasbulatov faction, but I know 
quite a lot about the inner logic of this power struggle. 
  [Pirker] Is the struggle about Russia a personal power 
struggle or even a gang war? 
  [Heinrich] The personal dimension certainly played a big 
role. However, it was not the hostility toward Yeltsin, which 
essentially characterized Khasbulatov's action, but that toward 
Filatov, who moved from the Supreme Soviet Presidium to the 
presidential structures and was thus considered to be a traitor. 
  First of all, of course, it was an institutional conflict, 
with both sides being blamed for the escalation of events. 
Thus, the president never really managed to empathize with the 
the parliamentarians, who, for the first time since the Soviet 
era, had real power. Originally they were on the president's 
side and advocated reform policy. At the same time, the Supreme 
Soviet whose deputies were responsible to their constituencies, 
felt the mood at the grassroots more strongly than was the case 
at the administrative level. 
  The institutional division of the country become visible for 
the first time in spring 1992; both sides used populist tactics. 
However, at that time it would still have been possible to come 
to an agreement since the monetaristic line of the West was not 
generally rejected by the Supreme Soviet. Even after 21 
September 1993 compromises would still have been possible. 
  One should not ignore the fact that this was also a conflict 
between political factions, and, naturally, this also has an 
economic dimension. The Supreme Soviet Presidium is an economic 
power. I got to know the functioning of the Khasbulatov faction 
to a certain extent -- dollars, that is dollars earned from 
Western relief supplies -- played a not insignificant role. 
What happened in the President's surroundings in this respect 
is largely known anyway. 
  [Pirker] Is it thus primarily the law of redistribution that 
determines various people's actions? 
  [Heinrich] It is redistribution without rules. The 
president's circle has now laid its hands on the building of the 
Parliamentary Center and has largely rented it to foreign 
companies. And this has been accomplished under guise of 
democratic president versus communist parliament. All that is 
not true. 
  [Pirker] But it was presented in this way in the Western 
media. Even though they knew better? 
  [Heinrich] I would not say that lies were spread 
deliberately. There is rather a lack of readiness or ability to 
assess the events in a differentiated manner. However, there 
were also foreign correspondents, who wallowed in Moscow's 
political morass and produced "facts" that corresponded to their 
ambitions. 
  [Pirker] In addition to the profane aim of enriching its 
participants, does the Moscow power struggle not also reflect a 
basic conflict over the direction of the reforms' development? 
  [Heinrich] As I said before: The Supreme Soviet felt the 
pressure from below against the effects of the reform more 
strongly. However, it would be wrong to think that Supreme 
Soviet advocated an antireform line. Even regarding the shock 
therapy there was no clear line dividing the political factions. 
People with an antireform image often advocated rather more 
monetaristic positions then the monetaristic establishment, 
which helped itself very generously to the state budget -- 
partly out of restraint to prevent a social explosion, partly to 
keep the lobbies in a good mood. Thus, the energy lobby, which 
produces two-thirds of foreign currency revenues, was treated 
very accommodatingly by Gaydar. Of course, the Supreme Soviet 
also participated in this policy of excess spending; regions 
were subsidized to gain political support. The ties between the 
local nomenklatura and the nomenklatura in companies in the 
struggle for subsidies has essentially characterized the lobby 
structure. 
  [Pirker] After the bloody massacre in October, which was 
supposed to put an end to the power crisis, forces have been 
regrouped, leading to the conclusion that the winners have not 
really won? 
  [Heinrich] I agree with that. The radical democrats' 
strategy to get rid of the opposition has failed. The 
opposition is now stronger than ever. This is, above all, also 
expressed in Russian foreign policy, which has now become less 
ingratiating, at least in its rhetoric, toward the West than 
prior to October. 
  [Pirker] Does that not mean that the real winner was the 
army, which now wants to implement its big power ideas? 
  [Heinrich] It is within the General Staff, and not the army 
as a whole, where the phenomenon of dissolution is becoming 
rather more intensive. The gap between the army leadership -- 
which behaves like a privatized company -- on the one hand, and 
the middle and lower echelons on the other has become even 
larger. There is an extremely hateful mood; spying on one 
another within the officer cadre has become some sort of 
struggle for survival. 
  [Pirker] What are the scenarios for further developments? 
  [Heinrich] One word more on the failure of reform. The 
reformers -- such as Gaydar and Fedorov -- came from nothing, 
without any real power bass: the three large lobbies in the 
energy, agriculture, and large industrial sectors. One cannot 
pursue politics in Russia outside these structures. The need 
for reform naturally remains, but another kind of reform. 
Because the reform pursued so far has not been monetaristic, 
either: it was either worse than that, or nothing at all 
happened. The most likely development now is to plod along; the 
departure of the radical reformers from the government makes the 
situation a bit easier, because this has defused the power 
struggle and the Supreme Soviet, too, is in a more constructive 
mood than had originally been expected. As a result, the 
prospects for reform have increased. The changed reform 
strategy will probably be the following: preventing the 
collapse of companies and establishing financial-industrial 
associations, meaning that the system is to be made controllable 
again. For this one needs a broad-based consensus, because the 
problem thus far has been that none of the presented reform 
plans has had the necessary legitimacy. One either had to 
accept cutbacks or try to gain legitimacy by autocratic rule, by 
attacking the legislature but oppressing the regions, and so on. 
I hope that it has now been realized that the problems cannot 
be solved by force, that one has to deal with the opposition in 
a civilized manner. This would be the optimistic scenario. The 
pessimistic scenario is that the struggle between the factions 
will continue unabated. Closing down the enterprises would be 
simply disastrous. It would be closing down without a 
structural policy. Structural policy would mean a gradual 
transition to privatization, to real privatization. A 
countertrend is exerted, above all, by the mafia, which feeds on 
the monopolistic structures because it aims at winning the 
monopoly and not at winning over competition. The end result 
would be a total crash. However, I believe that things can also 
be done differently.

<F P=106> [Article signed ALN: "Rwanda: Dehaene Questions UN Mission </F>
in Rwanda Participation"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- Speaking before the 
parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Monday afternoon [11 
April], Prime Minister Dehaene said: "In the current 
circumstances, the conditions have not been met for our 
continued participation in UNAMIR [UN Mission In Rwanda]." He 
also told the committee that Foreign Minister Willy Claes will 
meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali within 48 
hours in Geneva to discuss the matter. 
  Addressing the committee, Jean-Luc Dehaene questioned the 
future of the Belgian presence in Rwanda: "Everything depends 
on what comes of the Arusha agreement." He continued: "If the 
Arusha agreement is abandoned, the problem will have to be 
settled by the United Nations itself, since the UN forces were 
sent to Rwanda on the basis of this agreement being implemented. 
While we would still like to see this agreement implemented, we 
have to examine the problem of the UN troop mandate in general, 
and ask questions about our own participation in the mission." 
For Jean-Luc Dehaene, in the current circumstances, the 
conditions for the continued participation of Belgium in the 
UNAMIR have not been met. The anti- Belgian feeling that has 
been developing for some time and which has accelerated in 
recent days has made the presence of Belgian UN troops 
particularly difficult. On this subject, Willy Claes declared 
that he could not see why "we should continue to expose our 
troops to additional dangers." 
  The government has, moreover, authorized Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes to broach the issue in clear terms in a meeting with 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The prime minister also stressed that the government's 
"absolute priority" now was the success of the evacuation 
operation. As for the future of Belgian cooperation in 
development, he asked that there be no hasty decision "driven by 
emotion." 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes told the committee that 
he had taken a number of steps to officially make it public in 
Rwanda that Belgium denies the report which accused it of being 
responsible for the deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian 
presidents. This "totally false" report has further 
strengthened the anti-Belgian feelings of a minority of Rwandan 
extremists, the minister said. 
  Mr. Claes summoned the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels to 
demand that sanctions be taken against RTLM (Free Radio and 
Television of the Thousand Hills) which broadcasts anti-Belgian 
news. He has also asked official Rwandan radio to broadcast the 
Belgian denial, "but I note that that has not been done." 
  The minister again stated that he had also broadcast this 
message on the BBC World Service and BRTN [Dutch-language 
Belgian Radio and Television] which are listened to in Rwanda. 
He will also try through official Burundian radio.

<F P=106> [Article signed RHR: "Crisis: Claes Says No Solution Other </F>
Than Arusha Agreements"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 12 Apr (BELGA) -- There is no solution for 
Rwanda other than the application of the Arusha peace 
agreements, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes stressed on 
Tuesday [12 April]. Claes had been invited to the RTBF 
[French-language Belgian Radio and Television] news broadcast. 
  "I hope that these agreements are not dead but I imagine 
that 
the wounds are such that some time will be necessary to recreate 
a climate allowing meetings and negotiations to be restarted." 
Having said that, Claes continued, "to be honest, I see no 
other solution. I believe that the Hutus and the Tutsis, and the 
different political parties must inevitably meet in a huge 
effort of conciliation which must aim to lead to the formation 
of a national government of reconciliation, in a national 
Parliament of reconciliation, and which must also lead to the 
merger of the two armies followed by a large-scale 
demobilization." 
  "I see no other solution, there is not other solution," the 
minister insisted. Nevertheless he recognized that there were, 
"next to the ethnic confrontation which has a long history, 
internal political divisions and also groups which have far more 
specific interests and want the current situation to last.... 
Many (things) are based, I fear, on arms and drug dealing," he 
added. 
  When asked about the Belgian presence within the UN force, 
Claes repeated, as the prime minister and he had declared on 
Monday in Parliament, that it was necessary to enlarge the 
UNAMIR's [UN Mission in Rwanda] mandate, which was too 
restricted. 
  "But I have my doubts about the willingness of the Security 
Council to enlarge that mandate," he said. 
  However, Claes defended the Belgian participation in the UN 
mission, at the request of the two parties, the government and 
the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. And without wanting to 
comment on Belgian aid cooperation in the future, Claes said: 
"I believe that in any event we do not have the right to 
abandon the African continent, from the ethical point of view it 
is not defendable. Second, I believe that cooperation policies 
must go further than purely humanitarian emergency aid. Third, 
I believe that these policies must continue to be based on the 
respect of human rights and the development of democracy, even 
if Western democratic forms are not necessarily those which can 
function in Africa...." 
  "It is not because we have had some failures in 
democratization initiatives that we must allow ourselves to be 
discouraged and give up," the minister concluded.

  [Text] The Hague, April 17 (BTA) -- National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, who is visiting the Netherlands, 
conferred with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers who will visit 
Bulgaria shortly together with Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. 
They considered matters concerning bilateral relations, the 
situation in the Balkans and the Dutch assistance for Bulgaria's 
integration into European structures. 
  The same problems were on the agenda of a session with the 
President of the Second Chamber of the States-General, Mr. Wim 
Deetman. At a working lunch, MP's explained the forthcoming 
elections and the peculiarities of the Dutch parliamentary 
system, and especially proportional representation, the 
impossibility of any single party winning absolute majority and 
the need of a coalition government. 
  This afternoon Mr. Yordanov visited a plenary sitting of the 
Second Chamber, at which he was welcomed by the Dutch MP's, and 
then conferred with some floor leaders. At a news conference 
held at the Bulgarian Embassy, the National Assembly chairman 
fielded numerous questions from reporters of the leading Dutch 
dailies. 
  Before the end of his visit tomorrow, Mr. Yordanov is 
scheduled to meet Mrs. Van Rooy, the Dutch Minister for Foreign 
Trade.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- More intensive cooperation with the 
United Nations was the main issue for the beginning of UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's talks in Bonn. After his 
arrival on Tuesday [12 April], he first received FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Federal Government's guest house at 
Petersberg for a brief courtesy visit. 
  In a newspaper interview on Monday, Butrus-Ghali had said 
that he wants to advocate a German contribution to a permanent 
UN blue helmet task force of about 3,000 soldiers. By stating 
this, the UN secretary general, who expressly based his 
calculations on 1 percent of the strength of the national armed 
forces, seemed to expect a strength of only 300,000 men for the 
German Bundeswehr (currently 370,000 men). 
  As during his previous two working visits, the Federal 
Government will have to point out to Butrus-Ghali its hope that 
such decisions will become possible as a result of the ruling by 
the Federal Constitutional Court about armed alliance missions. 
The foreign minister expects such a ruling in summer 1994 at 
the earliest. Kinkel linked the issue with Germany's efforts for 
a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However, this seat 
is not issued by Butrus-Ghali but depends on a discussion of the 
United Nations. 
  The foreign minister urgently asked Butrus-Ghali for help 
with evacuating the 11 employees of Deutsche Welle in Rwanda. 
The United Nations, which has long had observers in the African 
country, has helicopters and other means of transportation, with 
which the Germans could be taken out of their isolated station. 
The UN secretary general promised to immediately examine that 
matter. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Kinkel also want to emphatically 
discuss with Butrus-Ghali an appropriate and representative 
settlement of UN organizations in Bonn. It was stressed in the 
Foreign Ministry that the promised transfer of the small UN 
information authority from Geneva does not fulfill this 
condition at all. 
  On Tuesday, Butrus-Ghali also met with Bundestag President 
Rita Suessmuth and had dinner with the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. The UN secretary general will attend the meeting on 
Wednesday as the guest of honor.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Monday [10 April] representatives 
of German human rights groups presented the Foreign Ministry in 
Bonn with material which, as they claim, proves the use of 
German arms by the Turkish Army in Kurdistan. The pictures and 
eyewitness reports document, among other things, the use of 
BRT-60 tanks from stocks of the former GDR People's Army (NVA). 
Spokesmen for the groups told journalists that this is proved, 
among other things, by the special equipment on the tanks and 
the NVA signs that are only superficially painted over. 
  The government in Ankara had stated that people had mistaken 
them for BRT-80 tanks, which Turkey bought in Russia. This 
argument had also been picked up by Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, who, however, has meanwhile temporarily suspended the 
supply of further German arms. The German observers said that 
if Ankara's statement was right, then the 10 Russian "alibi" 
tanks would have to be able to show up in many places at the 
same time. The Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on the 
presented material. 
  Martin Glasenapp, of the medico international relief 
organization, said that some 300 members of delegations from 
Germany and other countries "repeatedly" observed "the use of 
German arms against the Kurdish civilian population" during the 
Kurdish new year's celebrations Newroz on 21 March and the 
following days. Apart from BRT-60 tanks, observers saw and 
photographed also Leopard tanks, MAN personnel carriers, MTW M 
113-type armored vehicles, and special task forces with G3 guns 
made by the Heckler and Koch company. Moreover, there were 
"innumerous" reports by eyewitnesses on the bloodbaths caused 
with these arms. 
  Angelika Beer, a member of the Alliance 90/Greens Executive 
Committee, said that she was an eyewitness to Turkish air 
strikes on 26 March against the villages of Besuke and Gaver, in 
which 34 people were killed. While Ankara spoke of one bomb 
that was accidentally discharged, in reality a total of eight 
bombs were dropped on Gaver alone from helicopters and one 
aircraft.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- In the view of the Pro Asyl 
refugee relief organization, cooperation between German and 
Turkish intelligence services is constituting a danger for 
politically active Kurds. The information system as provided 
for by the Schengen Treaty (SIS) that nine European Union [EU] 
countries intend to implement in the fall creates an additional 
potential data base for police, military forces, and the 
intelligence services, also in Turkey, Pro Asyl and the German 
Association for Data Protection said critically in Frankfurt. 
  German intelligence circles have confirmed for DPA the 
exchange of data with NATO partner Turkey. The German side was, 
however, pursuing a restrictive policy, and any information that 
is provided is consistent with the FRG principles of a 
law-governed state. This means that information is denied if 
affected persons would have to fear "dangers of a special kind." 
The exchange of information is exclusively restricted to 
"counterespionage and the fight against terrorism."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on 
Tuesday [12 April] received Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jassim Bin-Jabuur 
al Thani, foreign minister of Qatar, for talks. Shaykh Hamad, 
who has been in Bonn since Monday, is discussing possibilities 
to increase cooperation between Germany and the Arabic Gulf 
emirate with the Federal Government and Bundestag deputies. The 
two countries are negotiating an agreement in the spheres of 
economic cooperation, investment protection, double taxation, 
aviation, and cultural exchange. 
  According to statements from the Foreign Ministry, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel and Shaykh Hamad in a meeting last night 
agreed to conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible. 
Bonn would also try to further extend relations between the 
European Union [EU] and the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the 
community of the six Arabic Gulf monarchies -- during the German 
EU presidency (second half of 1994). 
  Before his meeting with Kohl, the Qatari foreign minister 
held talks with Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag's 
Foreign Committee; Reinhard Goehner, parliamentary secretary in 
the Economics Ministry; and Friedrich Bohl, head of the 
Chancellor's Office. Tonight, the foreign minister is scheduled 
to meet Joerg Schoenbohm, state secretary in the Defense 
Ministry, for talks. 
  With exports worth 192 million German marks [DM] in 1993, 
Germany was one of the most important supply countries for Qatar 
(after Japan, the United States, and Britain). Qatar's exports 
to the FRG, mainly crude oil, only amounted to DM8 million.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Monday [11 April] the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] Executive Committee has welcomed the 
decision of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Presidium 
about the continuation of the Christian-Liberal coalition. 
Thus, the alternatives are politically clear, CDU Secretary 
General Peter Hintze told journalists in Bonn after the meeting. 
The choice is between the continuation of the coalition of the 
center or a red-green [Social Democrats-Greens] coalition. 
  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping can now save himself the trouble of continuing his 
"coalition hide-and-seek game." He can govern only together 
with the Greens. The CDU will clearly state the alternative 
positions in the election campaign. It will point to the focal 
issues of tax and financial policy, to reliability in foreign 
policy, as well as to the plans of Greens and parts of the SPD 
that are hostile toward technology. 
  Asked whether the FDP decision also means a preliminary 
decision for the election of the German president, Hintze said 
that he is convinced that there are good prospects that CDU 
candidate Roman Herzog will be elected. Answering further 
questions, Hintze said that potential differences with FDP 
Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger about the 
question of the deportation of Kurds are considered to have been 
eliminated by the minister's latest statements.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Klaus Kinkel, foreign 
minister and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] chairman, 
has called for a clear definition of the Bundeswehr's assigment. 
At a meeting with the Executive Committee of the Bundeswehr 
Association, Kinkel was quoted by the FDP press office as saying 
that "permanently playing around with figures" regarding the 
strength of the Bundeswehr is wrong. Kinkel clearly rejected 
the reasoning that the size, structure, and efficiency of the 
Bundeswehr should mainly be determined by the availablity of 
state funds. In the meeting, FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer 
emphasized that the Armed Forces are "not light switches that 
can be turned on or off according to short-term fluctuations in 
demand."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia/Italy: Ciampi Rejects Bosnia </F>
Serb Protest"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 12 -- Premier Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi said today he was aware of only one protest from Bosnian 
Serbs over the use of the Aviano Air Base in northern Italy for 
NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions near the Muslim 
enclave of Gorazde and added, "but certainly it is a protest 
which Italy can only reject." 
  Talking to representatives of the foreign press gathered in 
the premier's office, Ciampi said, "Events in Bosnia in these 
days can do nothing other than confirm Italy in its position 
pursued up to the present, which provides for joint action to 
apply maximum pressure to bring peace to Bosnia and, more in 
general, to all ex-Yugoslavia." 
  After noting that the deployment of NATO warplanes at air 
bases on Italian territory represents the nation's greater 
contribution to this effort, the head of government said Italy 
provided this assistance "with an awareness of the importance, 
and also the risks, connected to certain positions and can only 
calmly maintain this position." 
  Earlier today, the Italian press reported that the Bosnian 
Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, had threatened to make Italy "pay 
dearly for its complicity in the attack" with reference to the 
second raid carried out Monday by NATO planes flying out of the 
Aviano base.

<F P=106> [Franco Venturini commentary: "The Necessary Ally"] </F>
  [Text] Was it not perhaps Russian pressure on the Serbs 
which led to the liberation of Sarajevo two months ago? Was it 
not Moscow diplomacy which covered the backs of American 
negotiators in recent weeks? And now, as sole response, 
American NATO planes arrive to strike Serb positions without 
even informing the Kremlin, without consulting it, [not] giving 
it a mere telephone call from Clinton once everything had been 
decided. A true affront, which could extend the flames of 
Gorazde to the relationships between the United States and 
Russia. 
  A furious, red-faced Boris Yeltsin expressed himself more or 
less in this way to manifest his indignation. But do not fear: 
There will be no fire in relations between Washington and 
Moscow because neither of the two supposed pyromaniacs has any 
interest in lighting it, and indeed the appropriate diplomatic 
maneuvers are already under way to cool things down. Yeltsin 
will calm down. But the problem posed by his outburst of rage 
remains, because the West continues to lack any policy worthy of 
the name toward Russia. 
  The anti-Serbian incursions around Gorazde pose no question 
of legitimacy. For one year now there has existed a UN 
resolution which Russia voted for, along with the others, and 
which provides for the use of every necessary means to preserve 
certain Bosnian cities. Gorazde is one of these, and UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali had repeated in the last few days 
that the United Nations would resort to air strikes if the Serbs 
continued their murderous shellings. Hence Yeltsin cannot raise 
the question of the right to take action. But he can raise and 
he is raising a question of the appropriateness of this action, 
precisely the question which NATO and the United States have 
been unable to manage. 
  Perhaps it was felt at the White House that it would have 
been better for Yeltsin not to know, and that by leaving him in 
the dark NATO would, in reality, have protected him against the 
assaults of nationalists like Zhirinovskiy (the same person who 
yesterday was suggesting to heaven knows whom to attack Aviano). 
Maybe. But thinking this way would signify a lack of 
understanding of the fact that, in Russia, image is more 
important than politics, and that the greater offense, for 
Russians, is not to be opposed, but to be neglected. In 
particular when the Kremlin has already taken the risk of being 
unpopular within the country. 
<H5>  A Crucial Role </H5>
  We have to admit that Russian diplomacy for the last two 
months has been playing a crucial and constructive role in the 
Bosnian problem. Moreover, only Moscow is in a position to 
exercise fruitful pressure on the Serbs, who are Slav and 
Orthodox. The conclusion is obvious: There is today and there 
will continue to be tomorrow an absolute need for Russia, 
because, without its work of convincing, no peace project drawn 
up by the Americans or Europeans will be able to really involve 
the Serbs and therefore have a hope of success. 
  Was it not, therefore, necessary to be realistic, and to 
consult Yeltsin, and not to go ahead with the strikes in the 
absence of his approval? Not for a moment. NATO cannot and 
must not concede to Russia a power of joint decision which would 
pervert its role, leading very rapidly to a process of breakup. 
  And neither is it conceivable that America, as such, the 
sole 
real superpower, rely on the red telephone with the Kremlin 
before deciding on what has to be done. 
  Long ago diplomats invented ways of squaring the circle. One 
provides information at the appropriate times and in the 
appropriate fashion (as moreover happened for the second 
attack), one involves without subordinating anything, one shows 
respect without showing pliancy. 
<H5>  Family Picture </H5>
  This, and no more, the West owes Yeltsin. Otherwise, it 
would be useless to think of a pretty family picture, with 
Vesuvius in the background and in the July heat.

<F P=106> [Article by Enzo Bettizza: "The Union of the Extremists"] </F>
  [Text] This is not the first time that Italy has been the 
target of threats and blackmail from the East in connection with 
the war in the Balkans. Before Zhirinovskiy, another extremist, 
the leader of the Serbian Chetnik right wing, Seselj, had 
threatened to use medium-range missiles to hit not only the 
Aviano base in the Friuli region, but other Italian cities as 
well. Seselj, who is both the ally and the rival of the 
national communist Milosevic in Belgrade, is also the 
postcommunist, racist prototype that seems to have inspired 
Zhirinovskiy in his pan-Slavic extremism. The threat to destroy 
Aviano is, therefore, a recurrent symbolic gesture uniting the 
extremists of Belgrade and Moscow in the resurgence of 
belligerent pan-Slavism that has for some time festered most 
virulently in Serbia, even longer than in Russia. 
  Will, indeed can, the transition be made from the symbol of 
reprisal to the act of reprisal? After the blazing words 
uttered by Zhirinovskiy in the heart of West Europe, in the 
building that houses both the Council of Europe and the European 
Parliament in Strasbourg, the question is more than justified 
and is on the lips of many. Could the Serbs, egged on and 
backed by Zhirinovskiy, set about responding to the two strikes 
against their positions around Gorazde carried out by the NATO 
planes, with actions of suicidal folly? 
  For the time being, this hypothesis seems destined to remain 
just that. The Serb's policy of expansion and "ethnic 
cleansing" in the former Yugoslavia, and in Bosnia in 
particular, has undoubtedly been ruthless, bold, and 
bloodthirsty, but it has never been reckless or foolhardy. They 
have been cutting butter as far as the West is concerned. They 
have struck hard where they have been able to strike, but they 
have always stopped where they met strong, united resistance, as 
they did in Sarajevo in 1991 or, more recently, in Sarajevo 
after world reaction to the marketplace massacre. They did not 
attack the UN forces on the ground in response to the recent 
shooting down of their four fighter planes caught flying over 
Bosnia. Milosevic has always pretended to prefer diplomacy to 
force, he has negotiated, he has beaten about the bush, he has 
traveled tirelessly between Brussels and Geneva. His 
satellites, the Bosnian Serbs, have always divided themselves 
cleverly between the diplomatic moderateness of their political 
leader, Karadzic, and their military chief Mladic's tough acts 
of war. 
  One cannot see why they should fail to resort to reason, 
which they are capable of doing when they consider it necessary, 
at a time when the United Nations and NATO are demonstrating, 
with the recent strikes, their will to take selective rather 
than destructive action for the time being against the Serbian 
positions surrounding Gorazde. Indeed, the NATO aircraft have 
given "warning signs," at least to date, rather than engaging in 
real acts of indiscriminate air warfare against all the Serbian 
military lines on the hills surrounding Gorazde. The Bosnian 
Serbian generals, and Milosevic as well, probably appreciate the 
meaning of the Western warning and will seek some way out of the 
impasse in which the strikes have placed them. 
  This does not mean that a withdrawal, or feigned withdrawal, 
from Gorazde will signify the abandonment overnight of their 
intention to complete their great political design. This design 
is to take, if not Sarajevo which is further away, at least the 
Muslim enclaves of Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, and Tuzla, all of 
which lie on the fateful banks of the Drina, the river sung and 
so often dramatically described by the Bosian Nobel prize 
winner, Ivo Andric. "The Drina must never divide the Serbs," 
Karadzic has said. 
  The other side of the Bosnian coin, unfortunately, is Russia 
on its own account. When Zhirinovskiy threatens to shell 
Aviano, when he states that he wants to run to the aid of his 
Orthodox Slav brothers in Bosnia, what he is really seeking to 
shell is Yeltsin's headquarters. Yeltsin, not Aviano, is his 
real target. This is why Clinton, forced by European impotence 
to take the NATO and United Nations controls, perhaps 
disorientated by the excessive responsibility that has fallen 
onto his shoulders, was mistaken to give the go-ahead for the 
strikes without giving the Russian president advance warning. 
The idea that Russia must not be excluded, but diplomatically 
involved in all the more serious decisions regarding the war in 
the Balkans, is right. It is this war that Yeltsin's enemies 
aim to use to unseat him and push the precarious domestic 
situation in Russia over to the Right. Giving Yeltsin no 
notice, failing to consult him, adding the picture of his 
powerlessness to that of general European impotence, means tying 
his hands and handing him over as a prisoner to his and the 
West's enemies. 
  We realize that this is a difficult line to take. We realize 
that, between diplomacy and nondiplomacy, there is also a choice 
to be made that affects thousands upon thousands of innocent 
lives. But at the same time, we know that, should Yeltsin fall, 
the carnage in Bosnia could spread like wildfire and in no time 
at all become carnage on a European scale. The West, and Europe 
in particular, did nothing beforehand, and now, late in the day, 
they sadly find themselves forced to steer a hazardous course 
between decisions that are becoming daily increasingly difficult 
and complex.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Foreign Ministry </F>
Reports on Evacuees"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 12 -- An Italian Air Force C-130 
transport plane evacuated forty Italian nationals from the 
Rwandan capital of Kigali to Nairobi today and another twenty 
Italians were aboard a Belgian flight while the flights of 
Italian aircraft were opened to other foreigners wanting to 
leave Kigali, the Foreign Ministry reported here. 
  In the midst of reports of escalating hostilities in the 
capital of the violence-torn central African country, the 
ministry said the C-130 flown to Kigali today carried from 
Nairobi Italian paratroopers and other members of the military 
who were immediately deployed with Belgian and French forces in 
the capital to safeguard the airport and assist with evacuation 
operations. 
  Another Air Force C-130 was reported to have landed at the 
Kigali airport in the evening to continue the evacuation of 
expatriates. Eighty more Italian Army paratroopers were 
scheduled to arrive in the evening today aboard an Air Force 
Boeing 707 which will turn around tomorrow to air lift out other 
Italian civilians. 
  The Foreign Ministry said a group of twenty Italians were 
due 
to arrive in the Rwandan capital from the east and another 
twenty were coming from Gitarama. Eleven Italians working for 
the nongovernmental organization Giuseppe Tovini, with five 
Belgian nationals and forty Rwandan orphans who will be brought 
to Italy, had been blocked in Riilima by the advance of rebel 
forces but were now making their way to Kigali. 
  The evacuation of the volunteer workers, the Belgians and 
their charges, said the Foreign Minister, was made possible by 
Belgian troops who acted on an appeal issued by the Italian 
government. 
  The evacuation of Italians, said the ministry, is 
coordinated 
by the embassies in Kampala and Nairobi with the ambassador to 
Kampala in Kigali since yesterday to follow developments at 
first hand. The entire operation is going forward under the 
management of the ministry's crisis unit and the 
Chiefs-of-Staff's operations center. 
  Further evacuation flights will be scheduled according to 
security factors and in cooperation with Belgian and French 
forces, said the ministry. 
  Two Italian Air Force planes, a G-222 and a Boeing 707, took 
off from the Pisa Air Base this evening bound for Nairobi with 
equipment and eighty paratroopers of the Col Moschin battalion 
who will join in Rwanda 80 Italian troops sent Sunday aboard 
three C-130 transport planes.

<F P=106> ["R.R." report: "Berlusconi: `No Cleanup Operation'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi 
denies ever having considered a "cleanup operation." There will 
be no beheading of the "mandarins" of the First Republic, nor of 
the leading men in the ministries and the main state-owned 
companies. This was the commitment made by the Forza Italia 
leader who returned to the battleground yesterday afternoon in 
an interview with [fourth TV channel news broadcast] TG4. 
  Berlusconi stated: "I too have read about vendettas, and 
cleanups. They appear completely alien to me, and in any case 
are far from my mind and my way of thinking. I even think no 
one should have cause for concern." In short, a Berlusconi 
government would not apply the "spoil system," or 
across-the-board changes to the leaders of the administration as 
is traditionally applied by the American system. Berlusconi 
said: "As far as I am concerned, we have to roll up our sleeves 
and work together at rebuilding our country. There are so many 
problems to resolve that it is only by pulling together that we 
can hope to get through." Moreover, everyone who has written 
about clean ups and vendettas had better, in the words of the 
leader, "think twice." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
Francesco Cevasco; place and date not given: "Berlusconi: 
`Antifascism Did Not Lose the Elections'"] 
  [Text] [Cevasco] Have you heard President Scalfaro? The 
Resistance is part of history, and history is the truth.... 
  [Berlusconi] (answers very seriously) The head of state 
could 
not have better expressed the values of the Constitution, whose 
guardian he is. His reference to antifascism's historical truth 
is sacrosanct. Of course, we must take into account the fact 
that history is made of winners and losers, and that the winners 
would be well advised not to rewrite history exclusively to 
their own advantage, without showing understanding and tolerance 
in regard to the losers' reasons. True antifascism can only be 
the opposite of any form of fanaticism and historical 
integralism. 
  [Cevasco] You will then agree also with Democratic Party of 
the Left's (PDS) constitutional expert professor Augusto 
Barbera, who maintains that you should take part in the 25 April 
[Liberation Day] great antifascist demonstration. Will you join 
in? Personally? In word? In front of a videoscreen? In the 
street? Behind the.... 
  [Berlusconi] I welcomed professor Barbera's words. He is 
right to say that the "stupid" positions of a certain section of 
the Left concerning the Resistance has given rise to blind and 
violent ideologies, akin to terrorism. I thank him for his 
invitation to take part in the demonstration. On 25 April I 
will be, ideally, on the side of all those who celebrate Italy's 
liberation, considering also that there will be several 
demonstrations organized under a variety of banners. The banner 
that I personally favor is that of truth and of the spirit of 
national reconciliation. 
  [Cevasco] However, this 25 April is also being interpreted 
by 
the Left as a first instance of opposition to the pole for 
freedom's electoral victory. 
  [Berlusconi] The link between 25 April and the left-wing 
forces' wish to get their own back, which is a legitimate wish 
in itself, is somewhat murky. Everything would be clearer, more 
transparent, if the left-wing forces did not jumble together a 
national festivity with their grief over their own defeat. It 
is not antifascism that lost the elections. Rather, the losers 
were the candidates in the lists set up by the old PCI [Italian 
Communist Party], reunited for the occasion under the banners of 
the PDS and Communist Renewal. This is a very different matter. 
  [Cevasco] However, this 25 April will still be marked by 
division. On whose side will you stand? There are many ways of 
interpreting and remembering that date.... 
  [Berlusconi] I have already said on whose side I stand, and 
I 
do not find it shocking in the least that there should be 
different ways of remembering a date which belongs to everybody. 
Obligatory parades on 1 May were something which used to take 
place on Red Square. There are no more historical balconies and 
draft cards now. 
  [Cevasco] Where were you that day? 
  [Berlusconi] I was a nine-year old kid, who had been 
evacuated to Oltrona Sanmamete, a village in the Como province. 
  [Cevasco] How did your father describe events, and how did 
your family live through that experience? 
  [Berlusconi] My father never held a fascist party card, and 
in fact he was forced to take refuge in Switzerland for some 
time. My grandfather was even less fortunate: They forced him 
to swallow castor oil, not the "electronic" type either; one 
night -- he told me -- he had to hide under a bridge, at the 
Navigli [Milan canals system], out of fear of the Fascist action 
squads. 
  [Cevasco] If you had had in your hands the material used for 
the "Combat" program broadcast by RAI [State Broadcasting 
Corporation], how would you have reacted? 
  [Berlusconi] I would have broadcast it, just like RAI did. 
Perhaps I would have tried to be more sensitive to the feelings 
and the memory of the antifascists, but I would have not in the 
least censored those images which spoke of violence and 
brutality from the other side -- the kind of violence and 
brutality witnessed at Piazzale Loreto [site of Mussolini's 
execution]. In those times, censorship was carried out by the 
Minculpop [Ministry of Popular Culture], but I do not like the 
Mintelpop (ministry of popular television) any better. 
  [Cevasco] However, as a citizen, what is your opinion of 
that 
program? 
  [Berlusconi] Essentially -- I repeat -- it was a positive 
exercise, a tribute to historical truth. 
  [Cevasco] What did you feel when you heard [National 
Alliance 
leader] Gianfranco Fini define Mussolini as the greatest 
statesman in the century? 
  [Berlusconi] Mussolini governed for 20 years against the 
rules of democracy and freedom. Finally, he dragged Italy into 
a war, and the country was devastated by it. Having said this, 
historical truth and interpretation are always more complicated 
than the final verdict. I think that there were no elements of 
fanaticism, loyalism, or nostalgia in Fini's statement. It 
contained, in fact, an historical interpretation -- a legitimate 
one, although I do not share it. As for the question who is 
this century's greatest statesman -- at the risk of arousing my 
friend [Radical leader] Pannella's indignation -- I would 
answer: Giolitti, liberal Giovanni Giolitti. 
  [Cevasco] What, then, do you consider to be fascist today? 
The purges that are being threatened -- or what else? 
  [Berlusconi] The purges are neither fascist nor antifascist 
-- they simply do not exist. I do, however, consider the 
attacks and personal intimidation aimed at opponents who are 
regarded as enemies -- those which, as your Professor Panebianco 
wrote, have, oddly enough, become the speciality of one section 
of the Italian Left -- as actions of the "fascist school." 
  [Cevasco] Nevertheless, British and American newspapers 
abroad have highlighted the link between Forza Italia's 
electoral victory and the concern over a fascist comeback. Why 
is this so, in your view? 
  [Berlusconi] Partly, we in the pole for freedom failed to 
make ourselves clear. On the other hand, it is difficult to 
describe a situation which, for the first time, is truly new -- 
one which, to anyone attempting to give an account of it, 
presents traits that are completely different from anything 
witnessed for the past 50 years. However, the misunderstandings 
in the foreign press are also partly due to that syndrome which, 
in fact, was very appropriately described in yesterday's 
CORRIERE. Often correspondents paraphrase what they find in 
local papers, and what they hear in the opinion-making circles 
among the elite. If Italian newspapers indulge in emotionality 
and overexcitement, correspondents run the risk of contagion. 
You should also be giving some thought to this problem. It is 
not exactly a great self-image that the country is projecting to 
the outside world: It is neither beautiful nor true to life. 
  [Cevasco] Fini is also speaking, in his own way, of 
appeasement, and of overcoming the fascist-antifascist logic. 
Do you agree with this, and what do you understand by 
appeasement? 
  [Berlusconi] Appeasement means that each person sticks to 
his 
own principles and his own truth, without however infringing on 
other people's rights, and without bending history and memory in 
order to serve political aims -- all of this with the necessary 
observance of the republican Constitution, which can be 
democratically changed, but not dispensed with. 
  [Cevasco] By the way, have you read Norberto Bobbio's book 
on 
the Right and the Left? Where do you place yourself in relation 
to his definition of the Right and the Left? 
  [Berlusconi] I have not read it, but I hope I will have the 
time to do so soon. I appreciate Senator Bobbio. If the book 
confirms his views on the Right and the Left, as they have been 
expounded in many articles of his, I will say that my place is 
truly in the center, because I believe that there are vital 
values on both sides. However, I do not trust the old political 
toponymy, and in any case I am against intolerance and 
extremism: If such trends develop on the Left, I lean toward 
the Right, and vice versa. 
  [Cevasco] However, there must be some personality belonging 
to the existing or the historical Right, of whom you have a high 
opinion... 
  [Berlusconi] When De Gaulle came into power, the Left spoke 
of a fascist coup. Here is an outstanding personality -- 
classified as an exponent of the Right in a loose and 
approximate manner -- in Europe's recent history. The truth is 
that I prefer personalities who are difficult to classify. 
  [Cevasco] And whom do you consider as right-wing today? 
  [Berlusconi] The extremists on both wings -- those who endow 
political action with a ritual and rhetorical meaning, mistaking 
ideological beliefs for civil reason. 
  [Cevasco] Among Fininvest's opinion-makers, whom would you 
place more to the Right? Mentana, Liguori, Fede, Sgarbi, 
Funari, Ferrara... 
  [Berlusconi] I have no wish to make some hasty judgment on 
people with whom I have worked together in my group. Allow me 
this stylistic freedom. 
  [Cevasco] Granted, but allow me in turn to insist on Ambra: 
Some people have compared her to a "Giovane Italia" [Fascist 
youth] because of her militant faith in Forza Italia. 
  [Berlusconi] I will gladly make an exception in Ambra's 
case, 
because she is a young woman who works hard, amuses herself, and 
tries to amuse others. She is a TV personality, and that is 
that. It is absurd that she should be attributed so much 
significance, and that demonstrations should be called against 
her, thus treating a very young person and citizen like some 
sort of ideological object or symbol. 
  [Cevasco] Let us return to more serious things: Where should 
Forza Italia's elected deputies sit in parliament: right or 
left of the League and National Alliance [AN]? 
  [Berlusconi] In the center. 
  [Cevasco] Let us be even more serious: If you had had the 
age of discretion at the time of the civil war, which side would 
you have taken? 
  [Berlusconi] These questions are too difficult, because it 
is 
too easy to decide with hindsight. 
  [Cevasco] Let us, then, come back to the present. In a 
letter to IL MANIFESTO, [progressive candidate] Giuseppe 
Giulietti writes that Milan could be the ideal city for the 25 
April demonstration "precisely because it was from there that 
Berlusconi challenged the Left and is now preparing the ultimate 
affront of relegitimizing the fascists." Do you agree, at least 
on Milan as a venue? 
  [Berlusconi] "De minimis non curat praetor" [Latin, the 
praetor does not deal with trifling details]. As far as Milan 
is concerned, the only challenge I took up in the past was that 
of turning it into a more solid, more beautiful, and more 
European town. 
  [Cevasco] Giovanni Gentile, the fascist philosopher who was 
killed by GAP [Partisan Action Group] members, is now being 
revalued by the Left... 
  [Berlusconi] This is a subject for historians. His thought 
and his cultural action are the proper domain for philosophers 
and historians of ideas. 
  [Cevasco] One of the Left's hobbyhorses -- though not only 
of 
the Italian Left -- are the antitrust laws. Are you prepared to 
commit yourself to undertaking a review of the antitrust law on 
TV, thus obviously "harming" both Fininvest and RAI? 
  [Berlusconi] Antitrust and antifascism have only one thing 
in 
common: the "anti" prefix. I hope no confusion arises in this 
respect, which would be ludicrous. However, I am a champion of 
the market, in deed and not in name. Before the appearance of 
commercial TV in Italy, we really had a supertrust, the state's 
monopoly of TV. As far as the future is concerned, I favor the 
emergence of other broadcasting institutions, without however 
expropriating those who have invested resources and created 
employment, and perhaps I would invite others to run the risk of 
investing in the market, by appropriately amending the relevant 
legislation. The issue will concern me as a deputy and 
politician, but not as a businessman, because there will be a 
very clear-cut and transparent division between the two roles in 
the forms that we are currently examining.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi on Federalism"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Fiuggi, April 12 -- Silvio Berlusconi, the 
media magnate whose new Forza Italia movement emerged victorious 
from the March 27-28 elections at the head of alliances with the 
autonomist Northern League and the neofascist National Alliance, 
today indicated that his interpretation of the League's 
federalist platform would not require changes to Italy's 
existing Constitution. 
  Reiterating his willingness to look at ways of satisfying 
the 
League's ardently federalist urges, the probable premier said 
that "federalism is a word that can have many meanings." 
  "We believe that you have to move towards decentralisation, 
not only in the fiscal field. But we also believe that these 
indications are already present in the Constitution and that the 
Constitution must be completely enacted in this direction." 
  The latest, unofficial version of the League's federalist 
vision, propounded by radical cantonisation theorist Gianfranco 
Miglio, envisages splitting Italy into eight "macroregions" 
providing members for a house of parliament; their locally 
elected governors would also run the country alongside a premier 
elected directly by the people. 
  This would entail an overhaul of the Italian Constitution 
that other political forces say cannot be pushed through by 
government fiat, even if there is a pledge to ratify the results 
by referendum. 
  So far there has been no official response from the League's 
future government partners, other than the National Alliance's 
approval for a directly elected premier. 
  Berlusconi in the past has hinted that a commission of 
experts could be set up to examine German, U.S. or even Spanish 
federalist models, with the final word resting with the Italian 
people, by referendum.

  [Text] Who, among the following politicians, would you like 
to be prime minister? Silvio Berlusconi (43.5 percent), 
Gianfranco Fini (27.7), Roberto Maroni (9.1), Umberto Bossi (8.9 
percent), and Francesco Cossiga (5.3). 
  Thus, those who voted for the Right want Berlusconi in 
Palazzo Chigi [government's seat]. This is the result of an SWG 
[Integrated Research Services]-FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA opinion poll 
which was conducted shortly after the election results were 
known. The sample was composed of voters from the pole for 
freedom and the pole for good government in proportion to the 
votes received by each individual party making up the alliances. 
The sample was made up of 392 Forza Italia voters, 248 National 
Alliance voters, and 160 Northern League voters. Berlusconi 
also obtained approval from League (38 percent) and National 
Alliance (40 percent) voters. The League voters put Bossi only 
in third place, after the League's number-two man Maroni. In 
the 18- to 24-year-old bracket, Fini was the most successful (37 
percent against Bossi's 34). Fini also prevailed among 
right-wing voters from central Italy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Forza Italia Warns Andreatta on </F>
Slovenia, Croatia"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Fiuggi, April 11 -- Forza Italia members of 
parliament meeting here Monday [11 April] approved unanimously a 
motion warning Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta against 
making any formal decision at the April 20 European Union [EU] 
meeting to discuss membership applications by Slovenia and 
Croatia. Forza Italia MPs warned the Rome government "not to 
compromise the issue of EU membership to Slovenia and Croatia 
with any irreversible acts" at the Brussels meeting, referring 
to possible acceptance by this government of future membership 
for the two former Yugoslav republics on Italy's northeastern 
borders. 
  The motion gives a clearer indication of what the foreign 
policies of a future government under the Freedom Pole (Forza 
Italia, Northern League and National Alliance) may be with 
respect to the two neighboring republics. 
  Those borders and former Italian territory now belonging to 
Slovenia and Croatia, as well as the issue of rights for the 
Italian minorities there, are being cited by the neofascist 
National Alliance as reasons for vetoing EU membership. 
  Forza Italia MPs, as their allies, evidently fear that 
Andreatta on April 20 may commit future Italian governments to 
grant Slovenia and Croatia EU membership. 
  "This government that will be in charge for just a few more 
days, representing political balances that have been turned 
upside down by the popular elections, in recent weeks has taken 
decisions that may jeopardize irrevocably delicate issues that 
are often crucial for future developments," the Forza Italia 
motion claimed. 
  National Alliance wants to renegotiate three postwar 
treaties 
signed with former Yugoslavia and wants to negotiate special 
rights for Italians living in the two republics.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mafia May Try To Infiltrate Forza </F>
Italia, Parenti Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Fiuggi, April 12 -- The boom of Forza Italia 
Clubs, the local branches of the brand new party led by Silvio 
Berlusconi, has increased the danger of infiltration by the 
Mafia, according to former Clean Hands magistrate Tiziana 
Parenti, who ran successfully under the Forza Italia ticket in 
the March 27 elections. 
  "There is a danger of infiltration, even by the Mafia," she 
said, adding: "I am worried.... Some names ring warning bells," 
referring to names of people who have recently joined the Forza 
Italia Clubs. 
  Parenti, who worked as a junior investigator in the Milan 
corruption scandals before entering politics, declined to say 
which names caused her to fear that the Mafia may be trying to 
infiltrate the party, which has displaced the Christian 
Democrats and the Socialists as the new top gun of Italian 
politics. 
  She recommended doing background checks on all those who 
join 
the Clubs, stressing that the so-called anti-Mafia 
Certification, a bureaucratic statement indicating that an 
individual has no criminal record, "may not be enough." 
  Aside from organized crime, some discredited politicians who 
were ousted from power by corruption scandals and by the recent 
elections may try to reenter politics through the back door of 
the Forza Italia Clubs, Parenti also warned. 
  "The Clubs," she said, "must be checked and rechecked to 
make 
sure they are formed by people who want to do clean politics. 
The clubs have been used as a way of coalescing people but 
thorough controls have not been possible until now because of 
the speed with which they were organzied throughout the country. 
But now is the time to watch carefully." 
  Parenti admitted she knew of no specific cases of Mafia 
members joining the Clubs, but she said Berlusconi, too was 
"concerned." 
  Berlusconi however denied categorically that organized crime 
could be connected in any way to his support Clubs. "I rule 
out, for all I know, infiltrations by the Mafia in our 
movement," Berlusconi claimed. "I don't see any convenience by 
anyone linked to these organizations in having members inside 
Forza Italia Clubs," which "for the time being" have no 
political influence, he added. 
  Berlusconi reiterated his campaign promise that Forza Italia 
will fight organized crime and will do "more effectively than 
has been done so far."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "President Defends Judicial </F>
Independence"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Frascati, April 11 -- President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro on Monday [11 April] issued a defense of judges' 
constitutionally guaranteed freedom from political interference 
and warned magistrates to stay away from politics during this 
transition period. "In this so very delicate period of 
transition in Italy's political history and life," Scalfaro 
said, "the judiciary must represent a firm point of absolute 
certainty." 
  Scalfaro then warned against "anyone touching these 
fundamental constitutional principles, that are the breath of 
life for democracy." He also urged magistrates to avoid 
"polemics and speculations" and not to fall into "weaknesses" 
towards those colleagues who fall astray. 
  His statements appeared to be a multiple reference to a 
proposal by Forza Italia that would have public prosecutors 
appointed by the government, eliminating current career 
procedures within the judiciary itself, and to polemics over the 
handling of corruption cases. 
  The independence of the judiciary is now "more important 
than 
ever" and judges must "make the abuse known if anyone touches 
it," Scalfaro said, adding: "Even more important, judges must 
not give in to polemics and speculation." 
  Scalfaro, who as president is also chairman of the judges' 
self-governing body, the Council of Magistrates, apparently 
objects to the suggestion that the separation of powers between 
judiciary and executive be eliminated, a move critics claim 
would protect corrupt politicians from prosecution. 
  His latter statement could also refer to several recent 
controversies involving magistrates, including criticisms of 
judges accused of using corruption cases for political ends and 
the proposed blacklisting of hundreds of leading figures, 
including several chief public prosecutors. 
  The list was published by a right-wing weekly, which named 
people "whose heads should roll" under the new conservative 
regime of the Freedom Pole. The editors later defended the list 
as a satirical "spoof" but it was described by critics as the 
sort of purge to be expected if Forza Italia and its allies, the 
Northern league and the National Alliance, run the country. 
  Scalfaro also had a word for magistrates who find themselves 
in the limelight because of corruption investigations involving 
famous or powerful people. He warned judges not to give in to 
temptations of notoriety and popularity, to maintain at all 
costs pretrial judicial secrecy and to avoid making comments 
about their colleagues "who make mistakes."

<F P=106> [Marina Garbesi report: "`These Are the Men Who Must Be </F>
Sacked'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- The guillotine has already been greased, 
the list of the probable "beheaded" is four pages long. The 
names of the First Republic "mandarins" destined to climb into 
the tumbril leading to the scaffold are typed in bold. This, 
however, is not an edict, but a newspaper item whose title is 
"How Many Heads Must Roll." The list was scrupulously compiled 
by ITALIA SETTIMANALE (chief editor: Marcello Veneziani; 
leading commentator: Gustavo Selva) which claims to be the 
semiofficial mouthpiece of the new triumphant Right, and openly 
supports the government pact between [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi, [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Fini, and 
[League Secretary] Bossi. 
  A sort of "Who's Who" for the new era. In fact, following 
the era of power-sharing deals -- the weekly magazine claimed -- 
the beheading era is now to begin. 
  Who, then, will ride in the tumbril? Quite a few of the 
"powerful" risk losing their heads. A few judges, to begin 
with, such as Caselli, Cordova, Casson, Borrelli, and 
D'Ambrosio, "who are unlikely to continue their RAI3 [third TV 
network] careers in politics and justice, or follow the 
judiciary road to socialism." There are, then, the "anti-Mafia 
professionals," thus defined in a short article under the 
concisely effective, albeit somewhat sinister title of 
"Decollated Gowns," such as Luciano Violante, Antonino 
Caponnetto, and Giuseppe Ayala. These people must "retire 
early" from all institutional posts, and "less TV time must be 
made available" to them. The judges mentioned were in the front 
line in the war against Cosa Nostra and bribe city crimes and 
misdeeds. In the past -- so concern was being voiced yesterday 
in various public prosecutors' offices -- isolating those who 
were in the front line had negative, if not tragic, 
consequences, and we would be well advised not to forget this. 
  The metaphorical "executioner" also seems to have quite a 
huge job on his hands at the RAI [state broadcasting company]. 
The "new course" is said to have already arranged its basket to 
collect some outstanding "heads": Away with RAI1 Chairman Nadio 
Delai, away with TG1 Director Demetrio Volcic, away with RAI2 
Chairman Giovanni Minoli! On the scaffold are also TG2 Director 
Paolo Garimberti, RAI3 Chairman Angelo Guglielmi, newscast 
director Livio Zanetti, and radio broadcast programing director 
Aldo Grasso. ITALIA SETTIMANALE did not forget to mention also 
other predetermined (i.e., disliked by the winning coalition) 
victims among journalists. Thus, it was pushing Lilli Gruber 
and Corradino Mineo, Michele Santoro and Roberto Morrione, Italo 
Moretti and Giulio Borrelli -- all of whom are labeled "left" -- 
into the tumbril. 
  A good cleanup is also to take place in the entertainment 
industry. Gillo Pontecorvo, Luca Ronconi, Giorgio Strehler, and 
Lina Wertmuller will not escape. 
  Among the boyards to be purged, there are "many officials 
who 
are often more powerful than ministers." These are the names: 
Treasury "number one" Mario Draghi, economic programing general 
secretary Corrado Fiaccavento, and Antitrust Commission Chairman 
Franco Saja. The detailed list suggested that the heads of 
Federcalcio [soccer federation] Chairman Antonio Matarrese, and 
former minister Marco Carraro would also end up in the basket. 
Even the sins of someone like Volleyball League Chairman Carlo 
Fracanzani were deemed to be unpardonable. 
  The list (drawn up by Tuccio Risi and Lorenzo Stella) ended 
with a touch of malice reserved for police chief Parisi, who 
would also be waiting for the final verdict: "Will he save 
himself by becoming one of Fini's allies?" [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement ideologue Domenico </F>
Fisichella by Paola Di Caro in Milan; date not given: 
"Fisichella: National Alliance Did Not Give In to the League"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Di Caro] Professor, following 
your meeting with the League leaders, what looked like 
insurmountable differences between the Bandwagon [League 
nickname] and AN [National Alliance] have apparently been 
overcome. Is this so because AN "converted" to the League's 
position that the prime minister should be elected directly? 
  [Fisichella] We did not submit at all to the League's will. 
In fact, the MSI's long-standing presidentialism eventually 
allowed for two different possibilities: either the direct 
election of the head of state or the direct election of the 
prime minister. Both options have been taken over by AN and, 
personally, I have been advocating the usefulness of electing 
the premier directly for the past 10 years, at least. 
  [Di Caro] However, Urbani, one of the people involved in 
drafting Forza Italia's platform, stated a rather different view 
to CORRIERE, suggesting that the prime minister be elected by 
parliament, and speaking of a "soft" form of presidentialism.... 
  [Fisichella] Urbani said that the matter must be carefully 
considered. I am saying the same thing. So far, the two groups 
have met, a method rather than the substance has been agreed on, 
we have cleared the ground for constitutional reform. This is 
an important result, because the League and AN were the two 
groupings that were furthest apart. 
  [Di Caro] Far apart, particularly as regards federalism. Or 
have you also reached an agreement in this respect? 
  [Fisichella] I am saying that, if we want to achieve common 
objectives in government, we must all avoid setting impossible 
conditions. One of the impossibilities would have concerned 
asserting a double sovereignty: Well, on this count I found no 
objections. As for the rest, we did not speak of cantons or 
republics. In any case, also within the League there is more 
than just one project. In this respect, [League Chairman] 
Rocchetta said that the League is federalist also internally.... 
  [Di Caro] To return to Urbani, he also said that the 12 
macroregions mentioned in the Agnelli Foundation's project could 
be a starting point. 
  [Fisichella] I repeat, we must meet and talk things over. 
If, on one side, they are proposing the existing 20 regions 
and, on the other side, they are demanding three, then perhaps 
the 12 macroregions may be a possible solution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Claims Merits in Starting </F>
Economy on New Path"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 6 -- Italian Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi, who moved from his job as governor of the Bank 
of Italy to take over the country's helm just under a year ago, 
voiced his "pride" here this evening for having made a 
successful and not just economic contribution to putting the 
country to rights. 
  In an interview with RAI-Uno, the public broadcasting 
corporation's flagship channel, to be broadcast tomorrow 
evening, he recalled that, when he came to power, he had 
promised to manage a situation "of great dangers" including a 
"giant public debt" using only ordinary means. 
  According to Ciampi, people were dubious about trying to 
manage the crisis through market means, but the results were 
falling interest rates and the re-conquered confidence of the 
international markets. He also said the key was the incomes 
policy agreement achieved with the unions last July 23. 
  Another major factor was the lira's devaluation, which had 
turned a balance-of-payments deficit of 30 trillion lire into a 
surplus of 15 trillion. 
  According to Ciampi, all this may mean that Italy may be the 
first European nation to plunge into a "real economic recovery." 
  He also cited his government's continuation of the battle 
against organised crime, its moves to uproot corruption and 
other forms of malfeasance from public and business life, and 
the measures laying the foundations for giving jobs to the young 
people. 
  In other points, he looked back fifty years to the 
Liberation 
in 1944. 
  "Anyone who saw Italy with their own eyes then can only say 
that the country has made enormous progress," he said. 
"Particularly in the early years, there was an ability for 
translating political ideals of liberty and justice into 
reality. There was an ability for conjugating the Catholic with 
the nonconfessional matrix."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Taxes Would Kill Recovery, </F>
CONFINDUSTRIA Warns"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 6 -- A tax squeeze to correct the 
budget overshoot and stay in line with debt-curbing targets 
would kill off Italy's weak recovery, according to the latest 
economic analysis from the employers' association CONFINDUSTRIA 
[General Confederation of Italian Industry]. 
  Instead, CONFINDUSTRIA called for spending cuts, public 
sector wage rise caps, and a push to the privatisation process 
by lining up more Treasury-controlled banks like San Paolo di 
Torino and Banco di Napoli. 
  The report cited a string of encouraging pointers: moderate 
growth in output in February and March; domestic orders and 
sales rising since the end of last year; a slowdown in domestic 
turnover in November; a 6 percent rise in retail sales against 
November 1992; and warehouse stocks falling below normal levels. 
  Investment and business confidence was therefore on the 
rise, 
it said, but warned that it would be a "serious mistake" to try 
to correct public finances by using the tax lever, in the light 
of the almost 2 percent rise in fiscal pressure as a proportion 
of GDP in 1993 alone. 
  Immediate corrective action must come on the spending front, 
the employers say: a curb on current account spending by reining 
in intermediate consumption of public administrations as well as 
funding for private social and cultural institutions and 
publicly owned firms, where "cutbacks have been modest thus far." 
  Then, "there can be no discussion" of the need to hold firm 
to ceilings for public sector wage rises, despite recent 
"worrying" declarations by the Agency for Wage Bargaining. 
Finally, the cash tap of privatisations must be opened still 
further, the report said. 
  It said that the borrowing requirement target can be met by 
pressing ahead with sell-offs of Treasury activities, especially 
banks like San Paolo, corporate finance institute IMI [Italian 
Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property] (a third of 
which has already been offered) and Banco di Napoli, the 
insurance concern INA [National Insurance Institute] (already 
lined up), industrial groups like electricity company ENEL 
[National Electric Power Board] (slated to go next year), and 
real estate agencies like Immobiliare Italia. 
  In this last area, Immobiliare Italiana's convention with 
the 
state to manage public property and common land was "unfrozen" 
today after eight months of stalemate. The move was hailed by 
Immobiliare managing director Luigi Scimia as signalling a real 
will to exploit the agency in possible sell-offs.

<F P=106> ["Interview of Turkish President Demirel With the Albanian </F>
Television" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 11 (ATA) -- "Albania's policy is a 
factor for stability in the Balkans," said President of Turkey 
Suleyman Demirel in an interview with the Albanian Television 
recently. "Under the capable leadership of President Berisha, 
during the past two years Albania became a country with a 
positive influence in the Balkans." Regarding the possible 
expansion of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said: "I think 
such a thing will not happen." As regards the stand of Turkey in 
case of a spillover of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said 
that "we shall give our support for Kosova and Albania." 
Questioned about the Greek embargo against Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Mr. Demirel 
said that it causes a definitive damage to the stability in the 
Balkans. 
  According to the Turkish president, the creation of the 
Moslem-Croatian federal state is a step towards peace, while he 
described as meaningless the Serbian stand against the creation 
of such a state. 
  With regard to the opposition by Greece, Bulgaria or some 
other country to the dispatch of Turkish troops in Bosnia as 
part of the UN peace-keeping forces, President Demirel pointed 
out that "it is quite difficult to understand the stand by our 
neighbours. In fact we have not sent Turkish troops in the 
Balkans. United Nations are asking for Turkish soldiers, 
because there is a need there for soldiers to establish peace, 
and Turkish soldiers will go there to defend peace. I do not 
understand why does this matter become a subject of opposition," 
Mr. Demirel stressed. 
  In his interview, Mr. Demirel described as "excellent" the 
level of Albanian-Turkish relations, adding that they will also 
continue to be excellent in the future. 
  "I wish the fraternal Albanian people good fortune, 
prosperity, happiness and peace. May God be with us!," Turkish 
president said at the end of his interview.

  [Text] Brussels, April 12 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
called on the Rwandan authorities here Tuesday [12 April] to 
seek a political settlement to the tribal was which exploded 
last Thursday. 
  The EU urged the authorities to "safeguard the achievements 
of the Arusha agreements" reached last August -- a programme for 
reconciliation between rival Hutu and Tutsi communities that 
were to lead to free elections by 1995. 
  In a statement, the EU appealed "in the strongest terms for 
the lives of Rwandese and foreign nationals to be protected as 
they work together within Rwanda to safeguard its internal 
peace." 
  It also called for an international commission of inquiry 
into the air crash over Kigali last Wednesday in which Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprien 
Ntaryamira were killed. 
  The aircraft was reportedly shot down. The crash triggered a 
wave of carnage pitting the majority Hutus against minority 
Tutsis in which many thousands of people have been reported 
killed. 
  The EU also condemned the "appalling assassinations" of 16 
Belgians -- six civilians and 10 members of UN forces in Rwanda 
-- during the violence in Kigali.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nasty Serbs Have Not Yet Caused </F>
Dutch Battalion Any Bother"] 
  [Text] Srebrenica -- So far, the NATO air strikes around 
Gorazde have had limited consequences for the Netherlands troops 
stationed in Bosnia. Defense Minister Ter Beek, who began a 
four-day working visit of the Netherlands units on Monday [11 
April], will probably have to alter his plans as a result of the 
NATO air strikes. 
  The Netherlanders have not yet been faced with any 
aggression 
in the form of shooting or threats from the Serbs. However, on 
Sunday and Monday, virtually all units were placed on a higher 
level of alert immediately after the NATO air strikes. The 
Netherlanders freedom of movement is being further limited by 
the fact that convoys are finding it impossible to get through, 
and the Serbs are not giving soldiers on furlough permission to 
leave "their" territory. 
  In all likelihood, the 600 or so Netherlands troops in the 
eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica will be caused the 
greatest annoyance by the decision made by the Bosnian Serbs to 
break off contacts with the UN peacekeeping forces. The Dutch 
battalion in Srebrenica is dependent for supplies on the 
Netherlands logistics unit in Lukavac, 120 km away. The Bosnian 
Serbs must always issue their permission for such deliveries, 
which have been called off over the next few days. 
  Even Minister Ter Beek is not being granted permission to 
visit Srebrenica. The heightened state of alert means that 
leave is being cancelled, partly for security reasons. 
  The supplies of the Netherlands troops in Srebrenica will 
provisionally last for a good month. In the short term, the 
Dutch battalion needs the Serbs to allow helicopter flights 
between Srebrenica and the nearby enclave of Zepa, where more 
Netherlands troops will soon be stationed. 
  On Monday, in central Bosnia, the area from which the 
Netherlands transport battalion is operating, the Serbs closed 
the important Sierra One checkpoint between Sarajevo and 
Kiseljak, reported one Netherlands spokesman from Zagreb. 
Netherlands convoys pass through this checkpoint on the way 
from the Croatian port of Split to the Bosnian town of Busovaca. 
  Minister Ter Beek plans to visit this "home port" of the 
transport battalion. The question is whether he will get that 
far. Meanwhile, a group of UN military observers has been 
trapped in the hotbed of Gorazde. They include Netherlands 
Major Buisman. One spokesman in Zagreb said that the UN 
observers have been placed under house arrest by the Bosnian 
Serbs and may no longer leave the enclave. The Netherlands F-16 
pilots in the Italian base of Villafranca are keeping themselves 
ready to take part in any future action by the NATO air force.

  [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
announced here Wednesday [13 April] that it was taking Greece to 
the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in an attempt to overturn a 
Greek trade embargo of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM]. 
  The announcement by the European Commission followed 
Greece's 
failure to lift the blockade, imposed on February 16, after the 
EU executive decided on April 6 to go to court unless the 
embargo was ended within a week. 
  It was the first time that the European Union has taken a 
member country to court over an action which a member claimed 
was a response to a security threat. 
  On February 16 Greece blocked all Macedonian trade through 
the northern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the 
Macedonia's imports and exports. 
  Athens maintains that Macedonia robbed its name from the 
neighbouring northern Greece province of Macedonia. 
  It says this, plus the use of an ancient Greek sun symbol in 
the Macedonian flag and a reference in its constitution to 
liberating enslaved Macedonia, implies territorial ambitions on 
the northern Greek province. 
  The Commission objected because it said the embargo blocked 
trade of other EU countries with Macedonia, and could not be 
justified on the grounds that Macedonian actions had created 
international tension and the threat of war. 
  The Commission is hoping that the ECJ will quickly issue a 
temporary order that Greece should lift the embargo pending the 
court's decision on its legality.

  [Excerpts] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France warned Russian 
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to behave himself 
Tuesday [12 April] after he threw plants and clods of earth at 
Jewish protestors and spat on them at a Council of Europe 
session. 
  Zhirinovskiy also made threatening remarks inside the 
Council 
chamber in Strasbourg, denouncing NATO air raids against Bosnian 
Serbs and suggesting Russia should bomb European cities. 
[passage omitted] 
  In Strasbourg, Zhirinovskiy called the French warning a 
"provocation" and said he was only doing his job. [passage 
omitted] 
  On Tuesday the Union of Jewish Students in France called for 
his immediate deportation. 
  Zhirinovskiy began the day Monday by barging in on a meeting 
of liberal European legislators. They had written to him asking 
him to stay away from Strasbourg because of his extremist 
rightwing views. 
  Asked to leave the room, Zhirinovskiy berated the group as 
"CIA agents afraid to have a democratic debate." He added, "I 
was not invited here to drink champagne." The liberal MPs walked 
out. 
  Later Zhirinovskiy took on a group of some 100 Jewish 
students protesting outside the Russian consulate against his 
visit. They yelled "Down with fascists" and "Zhirinovskiy is a 
neo-Nazi." 
  Zhirinovskiy heckled the protesters from behind the iron 
fence surrounding the consulate and then lost his temper, 
ripping up plants from the consulate garden and flinging them at 
the demonstrators and journalists. 
  He also threatened the demonstrators with his "atomic 
revolver." 
  The Russian MP said Tuesday: "In fact I was attacked by 
extremists. It was the duty of the French police to defend me 
and they did not do it." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Strasbourg, 12 April (CNA)--President Kliridhis 
outlined his views on the Cyprus issue and other international 
problems during question time at the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) 
of the Council of Europe, following his address to the Assembly. 
  The president defended the joint Cyprus-Greece defence 
policy, welcomed possible European Union (EU) mediation effort 
on Cyprus, and strongly argued for Cyprus' entry into the EU. 
  Asked by British Labour MP Tom Cox about his expectations 
from the U.S., the president said he would like to see the U.S. 
"consider the Cyprus issue as one of invasion and occupation and 
exert their influence on Turkey to remove its troops from 
Cyprus" and encourage the Turkish side to accept his 
demilitarisation proposal. Replying to a question by 
Portuguese communist MP Urbano Rodrigues on the joint defence 
dogma and its effect on a Cyprus settlement, Kliridhis stressed 
he had no intention of attacking but intended to defend the 
country. He said the presence of Turkish troops created 
"anxieties among Greek Cypriots" and noted he would fail in his 
duty as president if he did not address these anxieties. 
  Asked by Polish Social Democrat MP Jerzy Jaskiernia to 
outline his position on Sunday's NATO bombing of Serbian 
positions, Kliridhis remarked that the credibility of the U.N. 
would have suffered a severe blow if they had taken no action, 
following a U.N. request to NATO for air-cover. 
  "Whether this would contribute to a solution, I have my 
doubts", he added. 
  Setting out his views on the problem of F.Y.R.O.M. (Skopje), 
the president advocated the elimination of references to greater 
Macedonia in the Skopje Constitution, followed up by talks. 
  He noted he learned in the U.K. during his education there 
that Macedonia is Greek "and I am too old to go back to school 
to learn differently," he said. 
  Conservative MP Sir Keith Speed sought an explanation on the 
definition of political equality and President Kliridhis noted 
"we accept the notion of political equality but this does not 
mean numerical equality." 
  Referring to Cyprus' European aspirations, the president 
said 
in a reply to Social Democrat (Dutch) MP, Ole Espersen he 
believed Cyprus accession to EU would alleviate fears of Greek 
Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. 
  "The knowledge that we will enter the EU would be a great 
contribution towards pacifying anxieties of both communities 
Greek Cypriot fears of another Turkish advance and Turkish 
Cypriot fears of being reduced to second class citizens." 
  Asked by a Spanish MP whether the EU should send a mediator, 
the president said "we would be delighted to have a EU mediator" 
but noted such a move could not occur while the U.N. Security 
Council authorised the U.N. secretary-general to "use his good 
offices mission to find a solution," explaining at the same time 
that Cyprus does not authorise the U.N. secretary general. 
  Asked by a Greek MP about what the Council of Europe should 
do to end the problem of Cyprus, Kliridhis advocated a two-fold 
role. 
  The Council can play a role in various directions, first the 
direction of the demilitarisation of Cyprus and secondly to put 
an end to the illegal practice of colonising the occupied areas, 
the president said. 
  Replying to another question on the issues of the 1,619 
missing and the refugees in Cyprus, Kliridhis said the 
humanitarian issue of the missing "affects adversely the CBM's" 
and argued for its resolution. 
  Asked by Polish MP Jansz Szymanski about Cyprus official 
reaction to the idea of PFP (Partnership for Peace), the 
president favoured the Republic's participation in bodies 
promoting peace and called for such a partnership to cover 
former East Bloc states. 
  Reiterating this idea, at the press conference later Tuesday 
afternoon, Kliridhis said "we are willing to participate in any 
European force created for the maintenance of peace and 
stability." 
  He expressed the belief that Europe must have a defensive 
force to maintain peace, adherence to human rights and the rule 
of law in Europe and elsewhere, noting also Cypriot membership 
of the Western European Union would be on the cards when Cyprus 
eventually joins the EU. 
  Asked to estimate when Cyprus would become a EU member, 
Kliridhis believed access of new members would not occur until 
after 1996 when certain problems within the EU are ironed out.

  [Text] Norway and Sweden have concluded in Brussels the 
texts of the agreements on the conditions of EU membership. 
Norway managed to get its demands on fishing concessions 
included in the text of the agreement. The fishing questions 
concerning Sweden's agreement were also solved a little while 
ago. And the STT [Finnish Telegraph Agency] is reporting right 
now that the text of the Finnish membership agreement has now 
also been concluded. Austria concluded its negotiations last 
night. The negotiations were urgent because the texts of the 
agreements must be presented to the European Parliament today so 
that the Parliament can vote on new members on 4 May.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Answers for Employment"] </F>
  [Text] "The most important task of future economic policy 
is to find answers to the problem of decreasing employment in 
industry." This was stressed by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky on 
Monday [11 April] at a conference of the Social Democratic Group 
of the Trade Union for Metal Workers, Miners, and Workers in the 
Energy Sector in Bad Hofgastein. 
  According to one of the objectives that the chancellor 
defined in an eight-point program before the Social Democratic 
metal workers, "Austria must not stop focusing on industry. For 
our export-oriented industry, membership in the European Union 
[EU] will make free access to the European Union, the largest 
market of the world, possible. In addition, however, new 
opportunities, particularly in the markets of dynamic growth -- 
that is, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and China -- 
have to be pursued." There are already tendencies of success 
that have to be strengthened now, "so that real economic growth 
will again be greater than the increase in productivity." Only 
then will the unemployment figures strongly decrease again, he 
said. 
  Economic growth could above all be considerably increased by 
a more ambitious infrastructure policy, the chancellor stated, 
who mentioned as examples, among others, the development of the 
railroad and the improvement of telecommunications. 
  In concrete terms, Vranitzky outlined an eight-point 
program. 
It contains the following proposals: First, the improvment of 
industrial location; second, the promotion of regional 
industrial bases; third, improved training; fourth, intensified 
export promotion; fifth, improved research and development; 
sixth, entry into the European Union in order to ensure access 
to the EU market and to be better able to protect our interests 
against other economic blocs; seventh, acceleration of the 
process for offering investors increased protection; eighth, 
making population more "industry-focused."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Livia Klingl: "External Coercion in the Age </F>
of CNN"] 
  [Text] At the very last moment, the West escaped a blatant 
disgrace by attacks on Serbian positions near Gorazde. One 
simply could not afford to permit the Serbs to overrun the 
Muslim enclave and UN "security zone," which is crammed with 
refugees. 
  However, the question arises why the Serbs were able to 
soften up the city for two weeks in full view of the United 
Nations, without the West awakening from its lethargy. And why 
certain statements played down the danger for the lives of 
64,000 encircled people toward the public, while internal UN 
papers warned against the dangerousness of Serbian attacks. 
  The assumption is obvious that the West would have actually 
liked to "sacrifice" Gorazde to the Serbs, since eastern Bosnia 
was recognized as Serbian long ago. An enclave is a source of 
continuous controversies and cannot be administered. If it had 
inconspicuously disappeared, there would be one problem less in 
the abysses of the Balkans. However, in the age of CNN, such 
cynical calculations cannot be maintained without harming one's 
own reputation. 
  However, as a result of NATO's latest signs of life, the 
initiative continues to be on the side of those who want -- 
literally -- to pacify Bosnia. The Russians have not succeeded 
in putting their Serbian brothers in their place. The United 
States is halfheartedly pursuing its concept for Bosnia -- with 
the main aggressors being left out. And the United Nations -- 
as a representative of states with different interests -- cannot 
venture too far. Typical example: The UN argues that the 
disciplining of the Serbs served to protect blue helmets. 
Credulous individuals might have believed that the lives of 
Bosnians had been at issue.

  [Excerpts] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- The evacuation of 
foreigners from strife-torn Rwanda continued Tuesday [12 April] 
as various embassies shut down their operations there amid 
reports of rebel troops closing in on the capital Kigali and 
ongoing tribal bloodletting. [passage omitted] 
  The Belgian defence Ministry, for its part, announced that 
nearly 400 evacuees, mainly Belgians, had arrived at Brussels 
airport Tuesday from Nairobi. 
  They were flown in on two planes, one carrying 195 people -- 
186 Belgians and nine people of other nationalities, and another 
carrying 204 people, 158 of them Belgian. 
  The defense ministry said a total of 446 Belgians had fled 
Rwanda, a former Belgian colony, and about 1,000 others remained 
behind. It was impossible to know how many of those wanted to 
be evacuated, the ministry said. 
  It added that the Belgian evacuation operation, being 
conducted by Belgian troops, should be completed within three or 
four days. Belgians made up the largest group of foreign 
nationals in Rwanda, with more than 1,500 living there. 
  Another flight from Nairobi, carrying 400 people, was 
expected in Brussels early Tuesday afternoon. 
  In Paris, meanwhile, the foreign ministry said two flights 
from Bangui were expected later Tuesday carrying about 55 French 
nationals and 30 people of other nationalities.

  [Text] A second plane landed in Belgium with refugees from 
Rwanda this morning around 0730 [0530 GMT]. It carried more 
than 200 refugees, most of them Belgian, as well as 10 Rwandans 
and around 20 Dutch. All of the passengers were transported to 
the military hospital in Neder-Over-Heembeek, where they were 
welcomed by Princess Astrid. A third plane with 400 refugees is 
expected to arrive this afternoon around 1515. Nearly 450 
Belgians have returned from Rwanda thus far. Last night a first 
plane arrived with 200 evacuees, while 12 Belgians reached the 
country last night via Koln and seven others via Paris. 
  According to the Army's information service, the rescue 
operation is generally proceeding as planned. The evacuation 
normally should last three to four days. The paratroopers are 
concentrating today on Kigali, where a few hundred Belgians are 
waiting to be evacuated. The operation is being hampered, 
however, by gangs, mainly composed of Rwandan Army soldiers, 
engaged in looting and killing. Meanwhile, rebels of the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front reportedly are approaching the capital. 
All together some 1,000 Belgians remain in Rwanda, but it is 
not clear how many of those want to be evacuated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Leo Delcroix, by </F>
unidentified correspondent, following a limited cabinet meeting 
on Rwanda, "this morning" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Delcroix] We discussed the future of the mission of 
the blue helmets. I believe that the situation in Rwanda is 
such that it is our duty to reconsider this mission. At this 
moment, Foreign Minister Claes is meeting with the UN secretary 
general to discuss the issue, because we do not want to make 
unilateral decisions. In my opinion, it would be a bit too easy 
to make a rash decision spontaneously and without consideration. 
That is not what we are going to do. We will first consult 
with the United Nations and its secretary general, and then make 
the necessary decisions in the next few hours, or days. 
  [Correspondent] But the Belgians submitted a request to be 
relieved of their mandate. 
  [Delcroix] It was not stated as such. At this moment, this 
certainly is not the case and I cannot confirm it, but I believe 
that the government will be able to make decisions in the next 
few hours, or tomorrow at the latest.

  [Text] In its daily briefing in Brussels the Army spoke to 
the press, so, Annie Nameus, you have some extra details on the 
confused situation in Rwanda: 
  [Nameus] First, about the evacuation of Belgian nationals: 
troops have been to the south, in the direction of Nyamata, 
bringing back the Belgians who wanted to come, but some decided 
to stay, because the situation appears a little calmer in the 
south. This convoy is now back in Kigali. It didn't meet many 
obstacles, just a few roadblocks. 
  Another convoy also went out today, 20 km to the west of 
Kigali, and, in the northwest, some 20 people, mostly Belgians, 
were taken from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi, where they arrived in the 
middle of the afternoon, under escort by soldiers involved in 
military technical cooperation. 
  I should also report that there are about 30 people at 
Kigali 
airport; they arrived after the last C-130s had left. The 
evacuation of Belgian nationals from Kigali is not yet over, and 
no final date for the evacuation has yet been fixed. 
  It is now the second commando battalion that is responsible 
for the town of Kigali. They are now being called the second 
commando battalion and no longer UN peacekeeping troops. These 
troops are, so to say, putting on their green berets again under 
their blue helmets. 
  The airport and the interior of the country are now the 
responsibility of the intervention units.

<F P=106> [News conference by Rwandan Ambassador to Belgium, Francois </F>
Ngarukiyintwali, with unidentified correspondents in Brussels; 
from a "special newscast"--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Some of your people in Rwanda say 
that the Belgians are responsible [for the downing of the 
president's aircraft]. Can you refute this? 
  [Ngarukiyintwali] Now, listen, in this tragic situation, 
particularly with regard to this issue, let us remain calm. Let 
us wait for the results of the investigation which already has 
begun. This investigation, which already has begun, must be an 
objective exercise which will determine who was responsible. 
  [Correspondent] You were summoned by the Belgian foreign 
minister yesterday. What did you tell him in particular about 
how this anti-Belgian campaign, which currently is ravaging 
Rwanda, should be stopped? 
  [Ngarukiyintwali] I admit that I was summoned to the Belgian 
Foreign Ministry, where I met with that ministry's cabinet 
director. He has informed me about the considerations and 
worries of his government, and it is my role as ambassador to 
transmit these to my government for its review and 
consideration. But, in principle, I can tell you that the 
Rwandan Government has asked me to do everything possible to 
avoid irritating Belgian-Rwandan relations. 
  [Correspondent] You distributed a note here from the 
[Rwandan] minister of foreign affairs and cooperation that 
accuses the [Belgian] blue helmets, who were entrusted with 
guaranteeing the airport's safety, and which says that the 
president's plane could have been downed by criminals because of 
the Belgians' failure. Do you believe that the blue helmets 
were responsible? 
  [Ngarukiyintwali] You say that I think...[changes to] 
thought 
I only gave you a document for your information which our 
Foreign Ministry submitted to the UNAMIR [UN Mission in 
Rwanda].... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] You represent this government. 
  [Ngarukiyintwali] I represent this government. So, this 
document was submitted to UNAMIR, and you will have to wait for 
the UNAMIR's answer.

  [Text] The Rwandan ambassador in Brussels [Francois 
Ngarukiyintwali] gave a press conference at noon today. The 
ambassador heard from the journalists that his government had 
fled from the capital, Kigali. Earlier, the ambassador denied 
that there is an anti-Belgian campaign in Kigali. Francoise 
Walminck, was that only a rumor? 
  [Ngarukiyintwali] "It is a rumor. I believe that, for Latin 
scholars, it would be necessary to find the etymology of the 
word in order to know what it means." 
  [Walminck] For weeks, Radio Mille Collines, a radio station 
close to the authorities, has been broadcasting anti-Belgian 
propaganda messages. 
  [Ngarukiyintwali] "And it is true that yesterday, I was 
summoned to the Foreign Ministry by Minister Claes's chef de 
cabinet. We spoke about various issues concerning the relations 
between Belgium and Rwanda." 
  [Walminck] But, for the ambassador: 
  [Ngarukiyintwali] "This anti-Belgian campaign in Rwanda does 
not exist." 
  [Walminck] Worse, the Rwandan Government is accusing the UN 
Mission in Rwanda and the UN soldiers of not exercising proper 
control at the airport when the attack on the presidential plane 
took place, and, even worse, of giving technical support to the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels and of playing an active 
role during the RPF operations against the Rwandan Army.

<F P=106> [Article by John Keegan: "Rose Holds the Aces in a </F>
Dangerous Game of Dare"] 
  [Text] The easier part of General Rose's task is over. 
The difficult part is about to begin. Not that his achievement 
thus far has been easy. The intransigence and deviousness of 
the combatants defeated both previous UN commanders in Bosnia, 
Generals Morillon and Briquemont. No doubt the warring parties, 
especially the Serbs, thought they could frustrate and dispirit 
General Rose also. His skill in playing to such strengths as he 
has had -- some high-quality troops and the authority to use air 
power in their defence under UN Resolution 836 -- has outwitted 
them. Looking back, it will be recognised that his manipulation 
of those strengths amounts to one of the most cunning 
military-diplomatic offensives ever mounted in the history of UN 
peacekeeping and peacemaking. 
  The war-weariness of the combatants has also worked in his 
favour. The Serbs, again in particular, had not only reached 
but passed what Clausewitz called "the culminating point of the 
offensive." They had captured more of Bosnia than they could 
ever hope to populate, knew that they could neither occupy nor 
partition Sarajevo, and were suffering casualties, and 
international odium, for no purpose. General Rose's 
determination to bring their bombardment of Sarajevo to an end 
may have offered them an escape from an impasse. 
  The end of the Sarajevo siege has not meant, however, the 
end 
of the war. It has merely shifted its focus. Colonel Edward 
Cowan, who was once the British military attache in former 
Yugoslavia, said yesterday that it opened the way to the next 
set of strategic imperatives. "The Serbs were always determined 
to clear out the eastern enclaves (Gorazde, Srebrenica and 
Zepa), and the Muslims were equally determined to win back that 
Muslim land on the western bank of the River Drina." 
  In recent months the Muslims have improved both their 
military situation and capabilities. The balance of advantage 
around the eastern enclaves nevertheless rests with the Bosnian 
Serbs. There they are far closer to Serbia proper than they 
were at Sarajevo, while immediately across the Drina lie a 
concentration of Serbian arms-manufacturing centres at Cacak, 
Kraljevo and Krusevac, all on the road running directly to 
Gorazde through Visegrad. The Bosnian Serbs were left 80,000 
tons of shells at the start of the war. Even if that stock is 
now heavily depleted, it can be replenished directly from the 
factories across the Drina. 
  UN observers have reported that much of the Bosnian Serbs' 
artillery withdrawn from Sarajevo has been repositioned around 
Gorazde, where they have also just advanced their positions, 
shortened the Muslim's defensive perimeter, and seized high 
ground from which to overlook the city centre. Gorazde is 
filling with refugees driven in terror from their homes in the 
surrounding villages. There is every sign that a siege as 
horrible as that of Sarajevo is about to begin but with the 
Serbs better placed to bring it to a conclusion on their terms. 
  The blame for that rests partly with the United States. I do 
not share the view that it is under any obligation to send 
ground troops to former Yugoslavia. It already does most of the 
world's policing, and if the Europeans, who have many more men 
under arms, cannot find the will and means to mount an effective 
intervention, their pretensions to unity for any purpose except 
the protection of their domestic markets are contemptibly 
hollow. Moreover, it is generally overlooked that the two 
effective UN air strikes thus far mounted were by American 
aircraft. 
  Nevertheless, President Clinton's recent reiterations of his 
refusal to commit ground troops, echoed by his Secretary of 
State and National Security Adviser, though issued for domestic 
reasons, have weakened General Rose's ability to utter threats. 
How, then, might he play the next round? What he has been 
doing so far is to commit his UN troops to carry out tasks that 
hamper the Serb strategy. He first employed them much more 
aggressively as aid convoy guards, challenging the Serbs to deny 
passage by force if they dared. They dared not. Then at 
Sarajevo he threatened air strikes if they dared to keep their 
artillery in place. They dared not. 
  At Gorazde he has committed special forces to identify and 
illuminate Serbian artillery positions so that they can be hit 
by air strikes, as they now have been. The Bosnian Serbs are 
known to be badly frightened by air power, which they lack, and 
thus far General Rose's strategy has worked effectively. 
  From this point on, however, the game of dare becomes more 
fraught. Because special forces have to see a target in order 
to illuminate it for aircraft, they run the risk of being seen 
by the enemy. Indeed, they run the risk of being deliberately 
hunted down. General Rose, a special forces officer of great 
experience, knows that better than anyone. At least one of his 
target indication officers was found and killed in the Falklands 
in exactly that way. 
  He is therefore faced with the dilemma of finding troops to 
protect his target indicators, when his chief problem is that he 
is using target indicators because he does not have enough 
troops to protect the Muslims in the eastern enclaves in the 
first place. If there is no such thing as a free lunch, there 
is no such thing as a cheap war, either. General Rose is poised 
on the brink of escalation exactly as the Americans were in 
Vietnam in 1965. Then their team of 17,000 "advisers" -- there 
are 15,000 UN troops in former Yugoslavia -- proved to be too 
few to bolster the South Vietnamese army. It may be that his UN 
force is too small to bolster the Bosnian Muslims' efforts to 
stand up to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  America got into a big war in Vietnam in 1965. How can 
Europe steer itself away from enlarging its peacemaking 
endeavour in Bosnia? It has no will to commit more troops. The 
option of arming the Bosnian Muslims remains a recipe for 
greater horror: let those who advocate it recall that a million 
people died after arms were poured into Spain in 1936-38. 
  We have to hope that General Rose can continue to out-dare 
the peacebreakers. Air strikes may have to be extended, perhaps 
against the bridges over the River Drina, perhaps against the 
Serbian complex of arms factories on the other side. The UN 
force has advantages the Bosnian Serbs will never possess, in 
signals intelligence, in target indication, in night-fighting 
capability, in special forces, and above all in air power. The 
Serbs, an observer of their military outlook recently observed, 
are "paranoid" about spies and special forces, which they 
believe are everywhere. They have a well-founded fear of UN 
aircraft. Let us hope that they take counsel of their fears and 
conclude that they lack the strength to put the UN force to a 
real test of strength. If they do not, the war in Bosnia may 
get nastier yet.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
reiterated that in the future Germany has to be involved without 
reservation in UN operations to secure world peace. Despite 
setbacks, the United Nations was becoming "the central guardian 
of peace for the human race," Kinkel said at the annual 
conference of the German Society for Defense Technology in Bonn 
today. Germany should not stand to one side in this, and has to 
"come down from the spectators gallery." The foreign minister 
added that the greater responsibility that Germany will be 
taking on also makes necessary a "corresponding voice" as a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Washington </F>
by Sabine Christiansen in Hamburg -- live] 
  [Text] [Christiansen] Good evening Mr. Scharping. You 
have just met with U.S. President Bill Clinton. What were the 
major topics that you discussed? 
  [Scharping] We had a quite long and very personal 
conversation on German-U.S. relations, on the situation in 
Europe, on the developments in the individual countries, and on 
parallel developments among the U.S. Democrats and the German 
Social Democrats. By the way, I would like to make one thing 
clear: The election campaign does not play a role, but the 
reliability and continuity of German policy does. It is good 
for Germany that no basic changes are needed in Germany's 
foreign policy. Yet changes are urgently required in the 
domestic sphere, which the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] will ensure. 
  [Christiansen] Did you succeed in guaranteeing the required 
reliability to the United States? 
  [Scharping] One thing struck me in particular. In the 
German discussion, there is a great deal of talk about combat 
missions and that this issue allegedly determines Germany's 
reliability as a partner and cooperation with the United States. 
I got the impression here that the issue is being overestimated 
in Germany. One should not claim that the United States is 
urging the Germans to participate in combat missions. This is 
not true. There are considerations here to introduce tighter 
rules, particularly in connection with UN missions. 
  [Christiansen] However, in view of the current mission in 
Bosnia, you probably also discussed the possible future German 
contribution. 
  [Scharping] First, the United States has no expectations. 
Second, there is no difference between the position of the 
Federal Government and our stance. The attack on Gorazde was 
the required response to an aggression that endangered tens of 
thousands of people. On the other hand, we agree with the 
government and the government agrees with us that German 
soldiers cannot achieve anything positive in Yugoslavia. 
  [Christiansen] Let us change the topic. Domestic policies 
were also discussed, as you just stated. The U.S. economy seems 
to have overcome the recession in numerous spheres. What can 
one learn from that? 
  [Scharping] It is a confirmation of what the SPD has been 
claiming for a long time. We need more investment and more 
favorable conditions to attract them. We need economic growth 
that must be environmentally compatible. We must reduce the 
public deficit and create a leaner and more modern state. 
Otherwise we will not be able to overcome the main problem -- 
the fight against unemployment. The United States has recently 
created 2 million jobs, whereas another 700,000 have lost their 
jobs in Germany as a result of the government's policy. 
  [Christiansen] Mr. Scharping, thank you very much for the 
interview. Good bye. 
  [Scharping] Good bye.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The GATT Agreement Includes a Long </F>
List of Defects"] 
  [Text] Marrakesh, Duesseldorf, 11 Apr -- German economic 
researchers have expressed skepticism about the future role of 
the World Trade Organization [WTO] and the GATT agreement, which 
is ready for signature. In a poll conducted by HANDELSBLATT, 
the Ifo Institute [Institute for Economic Research] in Munich 
said that the GATT agreement can make only a partial 
contribution to containing protectionism. The decisive thing 
is, much rather, that the individual states combat unemployment 
and ensure the reduction of foreign trade imbalances. 
  The IfW [Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research] 
stressed that the agreement can stand up to protectionism only 
if it is possible to punish the most important parties to the 
agreement, above all the European Union [EU] and the United 
States, with tangible sanctions in the case of proven violations 
of the agreement and to prevent them from one-sidedly 
implementing bilateral measures. The Federation of German 
Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) points to the weak 
sanction mechanisms of GATT. 
  The DIW [German Economic Research Institute], Berlin, is 
more 
optimistic about the chances of GATT holding its own against 
growing protectionism. The HWWA [Hamburg Economic Research 
Institute] fears that the new WTO will be overstrained by the 
comprehensive inclusion of global environmental issues. 
  The results of the Uruguay Round should be urgently 
consolidated and expanded. Industry is willing to support the 
government with all its strength. The Uruguay Round topics that 
are still open should be settled as soon as possible by means of 
further negotiations, and the work to establish a functioning 
WTO should be tackled. This demand is made by the employers' 
associations of the United States, Japan, and the European Union 
with a common appeal addressed to the GATT ministers' conference 
in Marrakesh. 
  Everything should be done to ratify the new GATT agreements 
by the end of 1994 so that they can be implemented at the 
beginning of 1995. UNICE [Union of EC Industries], Kaidaren, 
the U.S. Chambers of Commerce, the U.S. Council for 
International Business, and the National Association of 
Manufacturers welcome the fact that great progress has been made 
in the field of agriculture and with the full inclusion of 
services, of intellectual property, and of direct investments in 
the GATT discipline. 
  The employers assume that further abolition of customs 
duties 
and trade obstacles will lead to a strong expansion of world 
trade. In addition, discrimination and protectionism will be 
prevented by stricter rules. Finally, with the WTO, an 
organization is established that can, in the future, contribute 
effectively to stabilizing world trade and to settling conflicts 
that have developed. Violations of the spirit and letter of 
free world trade are made considerably more difficult.

<F P=106> [Report by Ulrich Rosenbaum: "FDP Makes Premature Decision </F>
for Coalition With Union"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Presidium of the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP] yesterday unanimously decided to make a 
statement in favor of continuing the Bonn government coalition 
with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union 
[CSU]. The recommendation is to be presented to the Executive 
Committee on 2 May and to the federal party congress in Rostock 
at the beginning of June. 
  FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel had suggested that the Presidium 
make a quick decision in order to end the debate on the 
coalition statement. He said that factual work had been pushed 
too far into the background over the past few weeks. 
  Over the weekend, FDP honorary chairman Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher said in an interview with DIE WELT that the public 
debate has made things difficult for Kinkel and announced: "He 
will clarify things very quickly now." 
  A decision in favor of continuing the coalition under Helmut 
Kohl had generally been expected. Kinkel did not give the exact 
wording yesterday. The FDP chairman only said: "Anybody who 
wants to prevent a red-green [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany, SPD, and Greens] formation, or a grand coalition, must 
vote for the FDP." 
  This way the question of whether the FDP reserves the right 
to cooperate with the SPD in case the CDU/CSU does not manage to 
achieve a government majority, remains open. Secretary General 
Werner Hoyer had been talking of a "conditional" coalition 
statement recently. Kinkel made a point of stating that the 
coalition statement is not a preliminary decision of the 23 May 
presidential election. If others establish such a connection "I 
cannot do anything about it," the party chairman said. 
  Only the timing was surprising for the chancellor, not the 
contents of the coalition statement, said Helmut Kohl's 
supporters yesterday. Rudolf Scharping, the SPD candidate for 
chancellor, is thus coming under pressure to state clearly 
himself with whom he wants to form a coalition. Bonn is not 
Mainz, where he could dodge a clear statement before the 
elections. Also, it is a known fact that the FDP does not 
consider the presidential election to be a matter of being loyal 
to their coalition partners. 
  CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze yesterday spoke of a 
"decision as expected." Thus, the choice on 16 October is 
either continuing the present coalition or going SPD/Greens.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Germany, by Vlastimil Kovar and Petr Nemec; 
place and date not given: "The Social Democratic Party of 
Germany Is Ready To Assume Power"] 
  [Text] [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] How realistic is it to expect 
that the Social Democrats will return to power after the October 
Bundestag elections? 
  [Scharping] The first elections this year -- Landtag 
elections in Lower Saxony -- were a good starting point for the 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] in "superelection" year. (In 
Germany, there will be 18 elections this year -- editorial 
note.) The results of the Lower Saxony elections are a clear 
signal that the SPD has a chance of assuming the leading 
position in Germany. If we work hard and concentrate on our main 
tasks, we can become the strongest party after 16 October. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Where will you look for coalition 
parties if you win? Are you considering the so-called grand 
coalition with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU]? 
  [Scharping] I am conducting no coalition talks. My 
objective is to convince the electorate that a political change 
in Germany is possible only if the SPD becomes significantly 
stronger. It is my impression that the supply of possible 
coalition partners is greater than the demand, which squeezes 
their price down, of course. I rule out the possibility of a 
grand coalition. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] In Germany and elsewhere, they speak 
about a crisis of the large political parties, since the 
electorates do not clearly understand their policies. For 
example, what is the difference between the SPD and the CDU? 
  [Scharping] I could certainly react to any political 
question by clearly saying that our solutions differ from those 
of the CDU. However, I will confine myself to the essentials. 
The SPD is of the opinion that to allow a large number of 
people to arrange their lives according to their ideas, our 
state and society must undergo an essential change. The CDU, 
however, wants to introduce only partial corrections to the 
evidently erroneous development. There are two fundamentally 
different ways of approaching the challenges of the present and 
the future. 
  The SPD does not have the exclusive right to provide 
solutions. When searching for solutions, however, it seeks an 
opportunity to discuss them with as large a number of people, 
groups, and institutions as possible. In this sense, the CDU 
lacks openness and spiritual flexibility. The CDU also lacks 
openness and honesty when dealing with people. 
  While the SPD has been stressing for a long time that the 
reunification of Germany and the unification of Europe will 
demand efforts from each of us according to our abilities, the 
CDU has created the impression that nothing will change in the 
daily life of the people. In fact, they have retained this 
philosophy until now. 
  The living and working conditions of each and every man are 
in the center of all our considerations. The CDU, however, 
which is not an independent force but only a herald of 
government's messages, has lost the feel for reality in this 
country. The SPD is concentrating all its forces on the fight 
against unemployment, which should be conducted by introducing 
the ecological modernization of the economy and the state and by 
reinstating social justice. 
  These are the basic conditions for preserving social peace 
in 
Germany; for unifying our country's economic, social, and 
cultural spheres; and for contributing to the unification of 
Europe. The CDU intends to retain Germany's competitive 
economic position by abolishing social measures. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Can you describe the SPD's economic and 
social program? 
  [Scharping] We want to finance jobs, not unemployment. We 
want to strengthen support for public works and programs aimed 
at creating jobs, even part-time jobs, and to intensify 
retraining courses. 
  To be able to preserve existing job opportunities and create 
new, competitive ones, we need an economic growth that would be 
in harmony with the environment. We must reduce our consumption 
of raw materials and energy, and support the development of new 
technologies that have good prospects. It will be important to 
introduce tax reliefs for enterprises that conduct their own 
research, who invest and create capital. 
  The German economy needs stable guidelines and good 
financial 
conditions. State-provided services must become more efficient. 
The state must be modernized even in the social sphere. We have 
to eliminate costs that we all have to pay. In this sense, 
extra costs for wages -- such as unemployment and retirement 
insurance -- are very important. These costs are linked to the 
reunification of Germany. 
  The reunification can be financed by providing compensation 
which will be calculated according to everyone's needs. The tax 
burden and levies in 1995 will be too high. They must not be 
increased. However, we must allow redistribution in the 
interests of economic progress and social justice. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] High wage costs and good social 
security are affecting the competitiveness of the German 
economy. How is the SPD going to solve this problem? Will this 
not influence your relations with the trade unions? 
  [Scharping] Our knowledge and ability, the creativity and 
imagination of our working people, and social peace in the 
country are our most important advantages. Whoever is able to 
efficiently use these factors and support them, will be able to 
compete on foreign markets in the future. Whoever wants Germany 
to compete with countries with low labor costs is using methods 
of the past, and is placing the fundamentals of our economy at 
risk. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] How does the leadership of your party 
see the reformist development in countries of Central and East 
Europe, in the Czech Republic, specifically? Do you have a 
specific concept in that direction? 
  [Scharping] We congratulate the countries of Central and 
East Europe on their success in reform policy. We appreciate 
the decisiveness and the speed of transformation, and the 
ability of your society, people, and social organizations and 
institutions to push for changes and create your own future in a 
democratic way, while putting up with difficulties necessarily 
associated with that. 
  From our viewpoint we believe is it remarkable that each 
country has been able to find its own way while following the 
same general path toward a market economy. The self-confident 
policy of the reformist countries is creating the new face of 
Europe and shows us how imperfect our previous image about 
Europe was. 
  We want to introduce a policy of good neighborly relations 
as 
soon as possible. Regarding our relations with the Czech 
Republic, the best way is to go beyond the limits that have been 
drawn in the treaty of good-neighborly relations. 
  German foreign policy will basically follow the European 
concept. We believe that in the future it will be impossible to 
conduct an isolated policy that pushes for interests that are 
not in harmony with the European Union. Of course, such policy 
must be established in cooperation with the countries of Central 
and East Europe, not without them. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Some politicians in the "Central 
European" space believe that social programs drafted by West 
European governments are overblown and hurt the economy. What 
would you say? 
  [Scharping] I can only speak about the social ideas of my 
party. We are convinced that the future economic growth will 
depend on whether we are able to offer products on the world 
markets that need little energy and raw material to manufacture, 
operate, and dispose of, that is, products that place as small a 
burden as possible on the environment. Only well-trained, 
motivated, and socially secure employees can do that. I am 
aware of the fact that our experience cannot be transferred 
elsewhere, since every country has different possibilities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Top Republikaner Candidate Protects </F>
Skinheads"] 
  [Text] Uwe Goller, land chairman and top candidate of the 
North Rhine-Westphalian Republikaner for the European election, 
has obviously covered up the fact that party colleagues of his 
were involved in an attack on an asylum-seeker's hostel. This 
can be concluded from documents available to the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution. 
  On 7 October 1991, skinheads attacked a temporary housing 
camp in Bergheim near Cologne. The perpetrators managed to 
escape. 
  Two years later, the Executive Committee of the Republikaner 
in the Mittelrhein district discussed the involvement of a 
leading functionary in the attack. According to the minutes of 
the meeting, a party member declared in lieu of an oath that the 
functionary had told him that he had planned the attack, 
participated in it, and then hid his friends in his basement. 
Land Chairman Goller was informed. He and his deputy met with 
the "denouncer." The result: The man withdrew his statement. 
Despite the findings about Republikaner involvement in crimes, 
North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister Schnoor (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) does not want to apply for a ban: 
"The party must be opposed by political means."

<F P=106> ["ban" report: "Criticism of Coalition's Crime Prevention </F>
Act"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 11 Apr -- The presidents of the Federal 
Intelligence Office (BND), Porzner, and of the Federal Office 
for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], Werthebach, have 
criticized the passages of the draft of the government 
coalition's 1994 Crime Prevention Act that apply to their 
powers, as insufficient. During the hearing of the Bundestag 
Internal Affairs Committee and the Legal Committee on the 
coalition's article law as well as on a draft law by the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] on internal security, Porzner 
referred to proposals by the coalition that the BND should be 
able to pass on "accidental finds," gained within the framework 
of its strategic telephone monitoring abroad, to the German 
criminal prosecution authorities. Upon urging by the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the condition was included in 
the draft law that the BND must decide within three months 
whether or not it has to pass on relevant information; in 
addition, the possibility for the affected persons to complain 
to the administrative courts was included in the draft law. 
Porzner rejected the deadline for decisions on principle. 
  In many international arms trade cases individual pieces of 
information are just pieces of a mosaic, Porzner said. 
Concerning a poison gas factory in Libya, built by German 
companies, the BND collected information over a period of 10 
years. Porzner warned against forcing BND officials to make 
statements at administrative courts on findings from friendly 
services. There is the danger that foreign intelligence 
services will restrict their cooperation with the BND or stop it 
completely. Porzner welcomed on principle that in the future 
the BND will be permitted to utilize information, even if they 
do not belong to the actual assignment of the BND. 
  Werthebach said that he welcomes the crime prevention act on 
principle. However, it does not correspond to all BfV 
expectations. This includes the BfV's desire to monitor 
telephone conversations of militant groups, even if they do not 
have a firm organizational structure. Werthebach also pointed 
to the ongoing desire that the BfV watch not only political 
extremists but also organized crime. The president of the 
Cologne authority finally pointed to the consequences of the 
privatization of telephone networks. In contrast to the 
Bundespost, private operators of telephone networks (Werthebach 
mentioned Mannesmann) refused to answer inquiries by the BfV. 
Werthebach called for information rights and information duties 
for private network operators. 
  Mr. Jacob, the federal commissioner for data protection, 
voiced reservations against the expansion of intelligence 
service interference in the secrecy of telecommunications. 
According to his findings, the results of telecommunications 
monitoring are smaller than expected. In particular, organized 
crime will know how to protect itself. The draft law must be 
changed. With a view to the planned utilization of accidental 
finds by the BND, Jacob said "secondary interests must not 
influence telecommunications monitoring and the evaluation of 
BND findings." Passing on information must be examined by an 
independent institution. 
  Wiesbaden Police President Hoffmann warned against 
consequences of the BND regulations concerning criminal trials. 
While the principle of legality commits police and public 
prosecutor's offices to reveal all findings, intelligence 
services are permitted to make a selection, in order to protect 
sources, for instance. "The unavoidable selective passing on of 
information by these services could thus become an element that 
controls the trial," Hoffmann said. 
  As set down by the draft laws, the hearing dealt with a 
broad 
range of internal security issues. Representatives of lawyer's 
organizations complained about individual regulations during 
shortened proceedings. 
  Concerning the introduction of the "great bugging campaign," 
differing opinions were voiced, as were concerning the SPD 
proposal that it should be possible to impound assets gained 
from crime in specific cases of suspicion. Tightened 
regulations to combat "money laundering," envisaged in the 
coalition draft, were criticized by pointing out that the law, 
which has been in force since 1992, has not yet been tested. 
The planned regulation on turning state's evidence in cases of 
organized crime was mostly supported. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FAZ Indicator: Broad-Based </F>
Recovery"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 11 Apr -- The recovery of the FAZ 
[FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG] economic development indicator 
continued with unchanged speed in February. With a value of 
108.0, the previous month's level was exceeded by 1.2 percent; 
compared to the corresponding month last year, the growth 
amounted to 8 percent. With the exception of the FAZ share 
index, which again went down slightly following the speedy 
increase at the end of 1993, all individual elements included in 
the indicator were clearly pointing upward. Thus, the economic 
recovery, which has been noted by the FAZ indicator for almost a 
year now, is spreading further. The opportunities for economic 
recovery in the course of this year have thus improved further. 
The increase confidence is particularly obvious in industry; 
the Ifo business climate index once again improved tangibly. 
After a temporary period of weakness at the turn of the year, 
orders received are clearly pointing upward, too. Particularly 
gratifying is the fact that domestic orders have, for the first 
time, clearly increased again. The positive development of 
foreign demand has continued. In addition to the economic 
improvement in important trading partner countries, the real 
external value of the German mark has declined further. A 
positive effect on the economic development is also exerted by 
the fact that the interest structure, which has been largely 
inverse since the turn of the year, has meanwhile disappeared 
almost completely. In total, the prospects are good that the 
Bundesbank will continue its policy of a cautious reduction of 
short-term interests over the next few months. The number of 
FAZ job offers seems to have overcome its low point, even though 
recovery is still very moderate in this field.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Ziller: "Rexrodt Loosening Export </F>
Controls"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 11 Apr -- FRG Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], wants to 
"considerably" loosen the export controls for goods that can be 
used both for civilian and military purposes (dual use). He 
calls for reducing the list of countries for which a permit is 
obligatory from the current 33 to only eight to 10. 
  Rexrodt's desire to reduce export controls takes the desire 
of industry into account. At the moment there are 33 states on 
the so-called Country List H; the fragmentation of Yugoslavia 
has not yet been taken into account. On the fringes of a visit 
to Egypt, Rexrodt had stated: "We will considerably shorten the 
H List." He is inclined to reduce it to "eight to 10" states 
and to also strike Egypt from this list. The FDP politician 
pointed out that his "considerations" still require coordination 
with his colleagues in the Cabinet. 
  The list contains nonallied countries that have not signed 
the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, have biological or chemical 
combat agents or carrier weapons, or are located in areas of 
tension. The list includes, for instance, India, Brazil, 
Argentina, China, Iraq, Iran, and many Arab states. 
  The background of the proposal is the necessary 
harmonization 
of export regulations within the European Union (EU). The 
common single market forces coordinated dealing with the export 
of such "dual-use goods," which are to be included in weapons 
systems or are destined to the production of weapons. German 
regulations are stricter than those abroad. A harmonization at 
the high German level has been rejected by 10 EU countries. 
Therefore, a regulation to permit Germany a stricter practice 
is being discussed. The top associations of industry reject 
solo action. A shortened country list could change that. 
  Following the negative worldwide headlines about the 
participation of German companies in the construction of 
poison-gas factories in Libya and Iraq, the liberal-conservative 
coalition tightened the law. Since then, Article 5c of the 
Foreign Economy Regulation says that the planned export of 
dual-use goods must be approved by the Federal Export Office in 
Eschborn, if the recipient is in a country that is on the H List 
and the exporter knows that the goods are to be for a certain 
purpose or are to be used for armament production. These 
stipulations force German companies to ask their customers what 
they intend to do with their goods. Industry considers this to 
be a competitive disadvantage. 
  The number of 5c-cases is declining strongly. Last year, the 
Federal Export Office rejected the export of goods with a total 
value of 46 million German marks [DM] (the previous year DM50 
million). According to information released by the office, the 
export of dual-use goods to a value of DM71 million (previous 
year DM220 million) that were to be used for armament purposes 
was approved.

<F P=106> [Article by "gb": "Alternatives to the Present Monetary </F>
Policy Exist; New Money Supply Concepts and Other Methods of 
Estimation; The Bundesbank Hesitant at the Moment"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 23 Mar--The Bundesbank's monetary policy 
has become the topic of much discussion. Its fundamental premise 
is that the height of the rate of inflation is basically 
dependent upon the amount of money in an economy. For this 
reason it is the aim of the Bundesbank to control the amount of 
money in circulation that is used to pay for goods and services, 
called the money supply. What is included in this, however, is a 
matter of discretion. The M3 money supply, the amount selected 
to be used as a guide, comprises note and coin circulation as 
well as sight deposits held by domestic firms and private 
individuals at domestic banks and savings institutions, time 
deposits with up to a four-year notice, and savings deposits 
subject to a three-month withdrawal notice. The criticism of the 
Bundesbank's monetary policy goes so far as to call for the 
abandonment of current money supply policy altogether. It is 
also being considered, however, whether changes in money supply 
policy will suffice. 
<H5>  1. Change in the Definition of Money Supply </H5>
  One radical move would be to replace the M3 money supply. 
The 
new money supply would be augmented by the amount of German mark 
deposits held in foreign markets ("Euromarkets"), because monies 
held outside the country can be transferred into the country and 
used for payments at no significant delay or cost. This new 
money supply would have the advantage over M3 that short-term 
movements of money in and out of the country would have no 
influence on the estimation of the growth in the money supply. 
For quite some time now the Bundesbank has done calculations for 
such a money supply, which it calls the "M3 extended" money 
supply. However, it seldom quotes this growth rate. 
  Differentiated models present another concept. Here the 
separate components of the money supply would be weighted with 
an interest rate; for example, time deposits would be weighted 
with a money market interest rate. This would give those 
components like time deposits, which are used not for payments 
but as investments, a lower weighting. The result of this would 
be that capital investment transactions such as rearrangements 
of time deposits and securities would disturb the money supply 
less than before. However, differentiated money stocks are also 
disputed. Estimates show that their relationship to the price 
level is often not as close as the relationship of M3 to the 
price level. 
  In addition, the Bundesbank has already changed the money 
supply once, from the central bank money stock to M3 in 1988. To 
the surprise of many banking experts, the chairman of the board 
of experts, Herbert Hax, recently expressed his support for the 
old concept. In comparison with the M3 money supply, with the 
central bank money stock the note and coin circulation was 
weighted relatively heavily as compared with M3, which, in the 
event of fluctuations in demand for note and coin currency, 
seriously distorted the rate of growth of the money supply. 
<H5>  2. Change in Method of Estimation </H5>
  A different method of estimation could be more promising for 
M3 than a change in the money supply limits. Up to now the 
Bundesbank has used a method of annualization, that is, it has 
calculated an annual rate from monthly rates. A growth rate of 
21.2 percent for January does not mean an increase in the money 
supply of 21.2 percent between the fourth quarter of 1993 and 
January of 1994. The money supply actually grew much more 
slowly. The rate of 21.2 percent results from the assumption 
that the growth rate that occurred between the fourth quarter of 
1993 and January of 1994 will continue over the entire course of 
the year. For, what is of interest to the Bundesbank is not the 
January figure but the growth rate for the fourth quarter of 
1994 as compared with the fourth quarter of 1993. The method of 
annualization becomes problematic at the beginning of the year. 
Why should the rate of expansion of the money supply observed 
over two months automatically continue over many months? This 
method is questionable particularly when the figure for January 
becomes distorted by extraordinary factors, as has occurred here. 
  One alternative would be to calculate averages. In this way, 
developments in the money supply over a six-month period could 
be compared with developments during the corresponding time 
period in the previous year. During a six-month period of 
observation, if one month's figures are inflated as a result of 
extraordinary factors, they do not have such a strong effect on 
the overall figure. BHF Bank recently proposed a completely 
different method. Although they are basically in favor of 
retaining the method of annualization, they have proposed that a 
different type of calculation be used for the first three months 
of the year in hopes of neutralizing extraordinary factors, at 
least in part. 
  Although the Bundesbank is aware of the difficulties with 
the 
money supply, there may actually be little readiness to discuss 
the problem. It has been said that they are waiting for quieter 
times before discussing alternative concepts. If the Bundesbank 
were to alter its policy now it would be said: "If they are not 
satisfied with the figures, they simply change their concept." 
They do not want to create this impression.

<F P=106> ["Rm"-signed report: "Late, Too Late"] </F>
  [Text] Two U.S. combat planes on Sunday evening [10 April] 
attacked a tank and a common position of the Serbian Armed 
Forces near Gorazde. The expectations that the Serbs would stop 
their artillery attacks on the city because of that was naive, 
since they have had encouraging experiences with the United 
Nations and the Western powers. They have waged their war of 
conquest since 1991. Only at the beginning of 1994 did the 
United Nations and NATO decide to take action; four Serbian 
planes were shot down. But that was not a sign to the aggressor 
that if he does not stop the war, he will be forced to do that. 
Rather, this was only a sanction because the Serbs had ignored 
the no-fly zone. The bombs last Sunday evening were dropped to 
protect the UN observers in Gorazde, which had been bombed to 
rubble by Serbian artillery. The matter can be presented in 
such a way that the observers were sent to protect the people, 
which means that protecting the blue helmets also means 
protecting the civilian population. The Serbian leadership, 
however, must feel encouraged that the United Nations still did 
not want to explain a minor, symbolic intervention with the 
intention to put an end to the Serbian massacres. It did not 
even take a day for the Serbian artillery to start shooting at 
Gorazde again. 
  Now, it is as if the United Nations and the Western powers 
were awakening from their self-hypnotized sleep. They see that 
further action is necessary. But what can be done now since the 
Serbs in Bosnia have practically achieved their war goal? There 
is still help for Gorazde, but it is probably too late for 
Bosnia. 
  President Milosevic in Belgrade is complaining about losing 
the illusion that the community of states is neutral in Bosnia. 
This was not an illusion, it was reality. So far, the United 
Nations and the Western powers watched the Serbian war as 
neutrals between aggressor and victims. However, it was a 
limping neutrality; the arms embargo against Croatia and Bosnia 
made the war of conquest even easier to Serbia, which is far 
superior anyway. At a late time, the civilized world is now 
nerving itself up to intervening haltingly. However, it cannot 
make good what it missed at the beginning of the war.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Martina Fietz: "Breathing Space"] </F>
  [Text] Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] leader 
Kinkel has created some breathing space for his party. With his 
statement that he intends to continue the government alliance 
with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union 
[CSU] in Bonn after 16 October, he has given his party the 
chance to carry out an election campaign on its own behalf. 
Without constantly having to answer questions regarding the 
loyalty to the coalition, the FDP can now clearly and plainly 
express its position. 
  Thus, Kinkel has stood up mainly to the critics from within 
his own camp, who have more than once requested a strong image 
for the party -- and quite rightly so, by the way. After all, 
the FDP has lost its traditional role as being the only party 
that can create a majority with another one. 
  The outlines of what the FDP's new "public relations work" 
can look like became clear yesterday with the request that the 
solidarity surcharge be reexamined after three years. The 
rejection of a higher gasoline tax is also a move to create a 
distance from the CDU/CSU. The FDP's basically positive account 
also creates a challenge for the CDU/CSU. It is in the areas of 
economic and fiscal policy, in particular, where the junior 
partner will try to distinguish itself against its senior. 
  Apart from the fact that the FDP has on principle defined 
the 
course for the continuation of the government alliance, the 
coalition statement has not yet been expressly formulated. And 
nobody must forget that it is intended to be an election 
statement "with conditions." Yesterday Kinkel said that those 
who want to prevent a coalition between the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens or a grand coalition now 
must vote for the FDP. He did not say anything about an SPD-FDP 
coalition.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Martina Fietz: "Blow of Liberation"] </F>
  [Text] Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Chairman 
Kinkel has got himself a breather. With his statement that he 
wants to continue the Christian-liberal government coalition in 
Bonn after 16 October, he has given the party the opportunity to 
pursue the election campaign for itself. Without constantly 
having to answer the question about its loyalty to the 
coalition, the FDP now can announce its positions emphatically 
and loudly. 
  With this, Kinkel primarily makes concessions to the critics 
in his own camp who have repeatedly called for the party to 
acquire a profile, and not without reason, by the way. After 
all, the FDP has lost its traditional role as the only party 
that can provide a majority. 
  What the new "public relations work" of the liberals can be 
like became basically clear when it was affirmed that the 
solidarity surcharge would be reexamined after three years. The 
rejection of a higher petroleum tax is a move to distance itself 
from the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union 
[CSU]. The basically positive commitment of the partner also 
challenges the CDU/CSU. In particular, in economic and in 
financial policy, the junior partner will try to distinguish 
itself from the senior partner. 
  Apart from the fact that the liberals have basically set the 
course for a continuation of the government coalition, the 
coalition statement has not yet been formulated. And one 
remembers that it is to become a "conditioned" election 
statement. In any case, Kinkel said yesterday that anyone who 
wants to prevent a red-green formation or a grand coalition must 
vote for the FDP. There was no mention of a Social 
Democratic-Liberal coalition.

  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France proposed on Tuesday 
[12 April] that Russia and the United States assume a bigger 
role in the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia, 
currently chaired by the European Union [EU] and the United 
Nations. 
  France also said it was examining the possibility of a UN 
Security Council resolution on the besieged Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde providing for an immediate ceasefire and deployment of 
UN peacekeepers, accompanied by a Serbian pullback "without 
delay and without conditions." 
  Opening a National Assembly debate on Bosnia, French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe said France would propose to its EU 
partners that Russia and the U.S. share the co-chairmanship of 
the Yugoslavia conference. 
  "Each of the three main partners, the United States, Europe 
and Russia, must recognise that it cannot resolve the problem 
alone," Juppe said. 
  The foreign minister also said the the Security Council 
resolution should call for an immediate ceasefire and 
"deployment on the ground of UN Protection Forces to separate 
the two communities." [passage omitted] 
  "We must fix precise political aims for our action in 
Gorazde 
as was the case in Sarajevo," where the threat of NATO attacks 
forced back Serbian forces and lifted their siege, Juppe said.

  [Text] There was a debate on Bosnia at the National 
Assembly this afternoon. France may submit a resolution on 
Gorazde to the Security Council, according to Alain Juppe, the 
minister of foreign affairs. 
  Francois Leotard also addressed the Assembly. The minister 
of defense justified the intervention by allied planes against 
the Serbs in Gorazde. Francois Leotard: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] We could not allow the attacks on 
Gorazde to continue, especially those of these last few days. 
We will not permit Gorazde to become another Vukovar. 
  The events in Gorazde doubtless mark another turning point 
in 
the Balkan crisis. Either the determination of the 
international community will be understood by all the factions, 
then the road will be open for fighting to be suspended, and 
negotiations to start again. Or the opposite will happen: The 
obstinacy of some people, perhaps too the orders of some 
military factions, will make the use of force necessary again, 
with the increase in military might that this would imply and 
the risks that one can imagine would result. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, I have repeated several times that 
there can be no military solution to the Bosnian conflict. [end

  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France has demanded that 
11 of its aid workers held by Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo be 
released, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said Tuesday 
[12 April]. 
  The eleven, 10 men and one woman from the nongovernmental 
relief agency Premiere Urgence (First Aid), were held last 
Friday by Serbian militia at Ilidza, near Sarajevo, accused of 
transporting arms in their seven-truck relief convoy carrying 
supplies from Europe. 
  Duque said: "We cannot accept these allegations, Premiere 
Urgence has a strictly humanitarian vocation." 
  He said his ministry had complained to the Belgrade 
government and to Bosnian Serb representatives there.

<F P=106> [Report by Charles Lambroschini: "Balladur in China: What </F>
Went Amiss"] 
  [Text] "With regard to human rights, Balladur ought to 
have spoken out. But he belongs to the Pompidou generation, and 
he maintained the habits of 1960's diplomacy, when there was no 
need to do so...." A member of the French delegation, on the 
plane home on Sunday [10 April], tried to describe the mistake 
which made the prime minister's visit to China go amiss. He was 
not alone. 
  The regrets began in Shanghai on Saturday when the arrest of 
large numbers of dissidents had looked like deliberate 
provocation. Forgetting diplomatic jargon, Alain Juppe 
exclaimed: "It is beginning to look like a lot of people. We 
do not like it at all." 
  On the eve of Edouard Balladur's arrival in Beijing, Wei 
Jingsheng's arrest was interpreted merely as a deterrent 
measure. Seen from Paris, the Chinese authorities simply wanted 
to prevent the most famous of Chinese dissidents, released last 
year after 14 years in prison, from seizing the opportunity of 
this visit to give resounding interviews to the journalists who 
were due to accompany the prime minister. 
  But, following the arrest of a second dissident in Beijing 
on 
Friday, just when Edouard Balladur was giving journalists a 
satisfied assessment of the political phase of his visit, the 
tough interrogations of three other dissidents in the big 
southern city could no longer leave any doubt. One deputy 
noted: "Contrary to what Balladur said in his press conference, 
`discretion' does not necessarily guarantee `effectiveness' when 
dealing with the Chinese." 
  Another member of the delegation went further: "We came too 
soon. After signing the joint declaration in January which 
closed the dispute created by the arms sales to Taiwan, Edouard 
Balladur ought not to have agreed to this visit without a 
serious guarantee that contracts would be signed and without 
specific plans for political cooperation. He ought to have 
demanded payment in advance." 
  One diplomat who is an expert on China explained that 
Balladur had come at the "wrong time." According to this 
expert, the approach of the fifth anniversary of the Tienanmen 
Square massacre had mobilized dissidents who were determined not 
to allow the event to pass without commemorating it. The 
authorities, for their part, were very nervous and allowed the 
police to act at the slightest move. "Li Peng," the diplomat 
stressed, "learned from the 1989 events that by responding too 
late, you are likely to face an uncontrollable situation. 
However, because of the social tensions created by economic 
modernization, he fears an even more serious crisis than five 
years ago. This time, he is afraid that dissidence by 
intellectuals will spark off a revolt by workers, threatened 
with unemployment, and by poor peasants more than 100 million of 
whom are roaming the roads." 
  One last restrospective regret: Edouard Balladur, according 
to several experts talking to journalists on Saturday, was a 
hostage in the battle for power which is currently stirring up 
the candidates to succeed old Deng Xiaoping. By refusing to 
invite Li Peng to Paris, the prime minister gave the impression 
that he was choosing one camp against another. This apparent 
involvement by a foreigner in an internal battle was immediately 
punished by the arrest of dissidents. In the plane between 
Shanghai and Paris, the matter turned into a case of settling 
scores. The culprit was no longer Li Peng but the French press. 
Sent by the prime minister, Alain Juppe lectured to the special 
correspondents: "You focused on human rights and you did not see 
our objective. We were looking to the long term. If France 
wishes to establish a place on what will be the biggest market 
in the year 2000, it must start now. If we want to have proper 
political relations with a country which represents one-third of 
the world's population, we must take the risk of taking the 
first step. There were no longer contacts between the two 
governments. Our ambassador was no longer received by the 
Chinese authorities. This visit was not only useful. It was 
necessary." 
  The demonstration would have been more convincing if Edouard 
Balladur and his entourage had sought contact with the press 
earlier. But, with regard to human rights, the rule was to say 
nothing. The prime minister did not wish to explain his 
analysis to the press for fear of seeming to provoke the 
Chinese. This was in vain, because, seeing on Saturday that the 
Chinese had laid a trap for him, Balladur eventually publicly 
condemned the arrests of dissidents as "unacceptable." 
<H5>  Goading </H5>
  Another observation is the inconsistencies between some of 
the French statements. Before his arrival in China, Alain Juppe 
had said in an interview with LIBERATION that the Chinese 
authorities' attention would be drawn to a number of dissidents 
by handing over a list of names. Following the talks in Beijing 
between the two prime ministers and the two foreign ministers, 
who met in private to discuss delicate matters, Balladur issued 
a denial that any list had been handed over. 
  Members of the delegation had advised the prime minister to 
respond to Li Peng's goading by a statement as firm as the one 
in 1984 in which Francois Mitterrand mentioned the "symbolic 
case" of Sakharov during an official banquet at the Kremlin. 
Others had suggested that the prime minister should cut short 
his visit as Jacques Chaban-Delmas, then National Assembly 
speaker, did in Moscow in 1980. 
  Each time the prime minister said no: The state's interest 
should come before its pride. But, in Paris, this attitude had 
the opposite effect. One final comment in the plane by one of 
those who accompanied Balladur: "By preferring to stick to 
reason, the prime minister, paradoxically, lacked realism."

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Sabatier: "Algerian Regime Should Be </F>
Helped, French Diplomats Argue"] 
  [Text] Aware of the risk of a civil war in Algeria, French 
officials are preparing to face a massive influx of refugees, 
and would like to convince creditors to help that country. 
  Algeria is "France's biggest foreign policy problem, which 
the government must face in the coming weeks and months," 
according to a senior French official. "And let us face it, 
France is not equipped to deal with it." Paris was not 
surprised by the resignation of Prime Minister Redha Malek. 
Government circles in Paris consider that "Redha Malek's 
resignation does not change the nature of the problem." French 
officials in charge of the issue acknowledge that "the regime's 
odds for survival are now very low." However, they still cling 
to the hope that the crisis may be defused through dialogue with 
some fundamentalist leaders and the unlikely improvement of a 
disastrous economic situation which favors "holy war" mongers. 
  The devaluation of the dinar has paved the way for renewed 
international financial aid. Other emergency measures are 
expected, allowing for a rescheduling of the country's 
$26-billion debt. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is 
determined to urge Algeria's creditors to help the country. He 
already did so in Tokyo during his recent trip to Japan, which 
is Algeria's second biggest creditor. He will address his 
European Union counterparts this week as well. 
  In Paris, the feeling is that other nations remain 
tragically 
indifferent to a highly hazardous situation. "Nobody is helping 
us to help them," complained the aforementioned senior official. 
While readily acknowledging that the blame for the current 
tragedy falls squarely on the shoulders of Algerian leaders, he 
said they should be helped all the same as "they remain the 
lesser evil." "Should fundamentalists gain power in Algiers," 
he added, "we would be left with a regime hostile to the West 
and to France, perhaps even a terrorist one. Contagion in 
Morocco and Tunisia will be unavoidable, and even in Egypt." 
  The United States does not want to have anything to do with 
the current regime. French diplomats even charge Washington 
with "talking to fundamentalists," because it thinks their 
victory is unavoidable. "They have not learned the lessons of 
Iran," says a fuming French official. The French concede, 
however, that there cannot be a political solution that does not 
include the fundamentalists. France did persuade Algiers to 
negotiate with fundamentalists over the last few months. But 
Paris admits that [President] Zeroual's attempts to do so have 
so far failed. 
  In fact, aware both of their powerlessness in influencing 
the 
way things are going in Algeria and of the country's apparently 
irreversible slide into civil war, French officials seem to be 
mostly concerned with planning the measures that must be taken 
to face the exodus that has already started. While repatriating 
the 2,500 French nationals still in the country will not be a 
problem, integrating the 50,000 or 60,000 with dual citizenship 
that are registered in Algeria will be more difficult. Senior 
officials reject the notion of throwing the doors open for the 
100,000 or so individuals that may try to take advantage of 
their ties with France, not to mention the 400,000 or 500,000 
Algerians who might cross the Mediterranean as "boat people." 
  "French society cannot cope with such an influx of people," 
say parliamentary representatives of the [governing] majority. 
Associations of "pieds-noirs" [Algerian-born French nationals] 
have already voiced their opposition to an "open-door" policy. 
Thus far, the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and 
Stateless People has approved very few refugee status 
applications from Algerian nationals. There are no plans to 
extend "temporary" refugee status to Algerian expatriates, as 
was done for war victims from Lebanon or the former Yugoslavia. 
"This would trigger a tidal wave of immigrants to our shores," 
says an official, who gives the same explanation with respect to 
the government's reluctance to open a debate on ways to 
reconcile France's asylum tradition, its historical ties with 
Algeria, and the fear of political destabilization.

<F P=106> [Interview with Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of the </F>
Republican Party, by Eric Zemmour; place and date not given: 
"Philippe Vasseur: `Like the Centrists in 1988...'" -- first 
paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS introduction] 
  [Text] In an interview with LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the 
general secretary of the Republican Party [PR] explained what 
had led his party and a number of PR deputies to envision 
forming an independent Republican group in the National Assembly. 
  [Zemmour] Why did the PR vent its fury after the victory 
scored by Dominique Baudis over Jean-Francois Deniau? 
  [Vasseur] Dominique Baudis was nominated by the French 
Democratic Union [UDF]. This will place him at the top of the 
majority's list during the upcoming European elections. We have 
been -- and still remain -- militant UDF members. Dominique 
Baudis can count on the support of the Republican Party in the 
upcoming European elections. However, I will not conceal the 
fact that the feeling dominating within the PR today is one of 
bitterness. Dominique Baudis is not involved in this issue; 
rather it is the way in which things have happened that is to 
blame. Of course, we are resigned to the outcome, but we feel 
obliged to point out that some votes would not have gone the 
same way a few weeks ago or even just a few days ago. 
  [Zemmour] Could you be more specific? 
  [Vasseur] Right up to the end, we believed that the UDF was 
facing a strategic choice: Which name would be best at the top 
of the UDF's list? Who could best reconcile the ideas and 
beliefs of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and the UDF, of 
those who voted "Yes" to Maastricht, and those who voted "No"; 
in other words, who would best be able to rally the electorate 
of the majority -- i.e., the full majority -- behind them? 
  We believed that we are capable of that. We then found that 
we were the victims of people who made a choice based on the 
economic situation, based on a line of argument that had 
strictly nothing to do with the issue at hand 
  [Zemmour] Is it Andre Santini you are talking about in this 
context? 
  [Vasseur] I do not wish to name any names. I merely wish to 
say that after this vote some members of the PR -- and I 
understand their impatience and view of events -- said that they 
had had enough of it always being the PR which made an effort 
and never received anything in return. 
  [Zemmour] In actual fact this is not your first failure to 
impose your views and candidates on the UDF. Should the PR not 
call its strategies within the confederation into question, stop 
outwardly playing "the tough guys" only to end up bowing to the 
UDF's more or less democratic procedures. 
  [Vasseur] We are not playing the "tough guys." We are an 
undeniably political force, which is well organized on the 
ground, and has a large number of active members. Furthermore, 
we have long been convinced of the need for the UDF, and have 
merrily played the game of confederation. However, we will not 
sacrifice our identity. And the bad practices to which we have 
fallen victim are leading a certain number among our ranks to 
seek a new, more efficient way of affirming our identity. 
  [Zemmour] What do you mean? 
  [Vasseur] Some PR deputies, and by no means just a few of 
them, are currently lending very serious consideration to the 
appropriateness of establishing a Republican group in the 
National Assembly. 
  [Zemmour] Would that be a terrible blow to the UDF? 
  [Vasseur] There have been precedents. Between 1988 and 1993 
the centrists formed their own autonomous group. Some CDS 
[Social Democratic Center] remained within the UDF, others 
joined the UDC [Union of the Center]. The PR deputies would do 
the same. So they would not be the first people to have 
committed a crime of "high treason" with regard to the UDF. 
  [Zemmour] Is it a reprisal measure? 
  [Vasseur] No. Merely, the product of our analysis of the 
situation. Within the UDF, most of the time the PR is smothered 
and cannot make itself heard. There can be no doubt that having 
an autonomous group would enable it to do so more. For a long 
time, those in favor of keeping the PR deputies within the 
single group of the UDF have been saying that the message and 
ideas of the PR would become more widespread as a result. These 
arguments do not stand up. We are quietly considering the 
establishment of such an autonomous group. This week we will be 
meeting to make our decision. We did not wish to raise this 
question until after the European elections. So the dates 
initially planned could now be brought forward. I repeat, this 
is not a reprisal measure. However, the defeat of Jean-Francois 
Deniau the other day was the straw that broke the camel's back. 
Enough is enough. In my capacity as the general secretary of 
the party, I am the guarantor of the party's unity, but I must 
admit, the arguments of those in favor of autonomy have shaken 
me. 
  [Zemmour] Do you have the support of PR Chairman Gerard 
Longuet? 
  [Vasseur] Until the end of last week, Gerard Longuet was in 
China and we could not reach him. No final decision has yet 
been made. Nor will any such decision be made without the 
backing of the party and its president. 
  [Zemmour] An independent PR group would develop closer ties 
with the RPR than it had previously enjoyed. Are we heading for 
the open establishment of a dominant RPR-PR axis within the 
majority? 
  [Vasseur] The existence of this independent Republican group 
will not prevent the PR from remaining a member of the UDF, just 
as the CDS did between 1988 and 1993. 
  Nonetheless, it is true that we have always been in favor of 
a solid union within the majority. In the absence of any 
context, the Republican group would be an excellent link between 
the RPR and the UDF. 
  [Zemmour] Nevertheless, the PR was counting on the RPR to a 
great extent to reject Dominique Baudis as the majority's top 
candidate. Are you disappointed by the choice made by the RPR? 
  [Vasseur] Even if the RPR had rejected Dominique Baudis, 
Jean-Francois Deniau could not have found himself back in the 
saddle. However, it is true that many members of the PR had 
hoped that a refusal by the RPR to ratify the decision made by 
the political leadership of the UDF would enable a third man to 
emerge. The RPR made the choice that we now know. I repeat, 
Dominique Baudis can count on the support of the Republican 
Party.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Antonio Padellaro; place and date not given: "No Need 
To Worry, Fini Will Win in the End" -- first paragraph is 
L'ESPRESSO introduction] 
  [Text] It is still difficult to say whether Italian 
democracy can really trust Gianfranco Fini's ex-fascist 
movement. Shortly after his election success, the leader of 
National Alliance referred to Benito Mussolini as "the greatest 
statesman this century has seen," to the horror of the 
international press. And even within the composite Pole for 
Freedom, Umberto Bossi has not changed his mind: "Fini is the 
head of a reactionary right wing." Nevertheless, even Berlusconi 
would do well to keep an eye on this young partner of his. At 
25, he was a modest editor on the obscure SECOLO D'ITALIA, the 
organ of the untouchable MSI [Italian Social Movement]. At 44, 
he is at the head of the third-largest force (105 deputies and 
43 senators) in the 12th republican parliament, and the fulcrum 
for any government majority. What is more, they say he is 
already working on eventually becoming the leader of an Italy 
brought once more under the yoke of the Right. 
  What is Fini like in person? Polite, moderate, controlled; 
cold as only those who have a lot of scores to settle can be. 
What is he hiding under his double-breasted jacket? In an 
attempt to find out, L'ESPRESSO subjected him to a long third 
degree. 
  [Padellaro] Berlusconi's greatest quality? 
  [Fini] Spontaneity, enthusiasm. 
  [Padellaro] His worst drawback? 
  [Fini] Inexperience, a total lack of political experience. 
  [Padellaro] How long can a Berlusconi government last? 
  [Fini] It can go full term, just as it may not even see the 
light of day. 
  [Padellaro] What is it about Bossi that astounds you? 
  [Fini] His absolute unpredictability. He spends his time 
giving the lie to himself without ever suffering the 
consequences. 
  [Padellaro] What is it that you cannot stand in him? 
  [Fini] He is really coarse. He is more propaganda than 
policy, more rallying than reasoning. 
  [Padellaro] And how does Fini assess himself? 
  [Fini] Persevering, more obstinate, I think, than anyone in 
the world. 
  [Padellaro] Faults? 
  [Fini] Too methodical and mentally organized, so tending to 
be unimaginative. 
  [Padellaro] What use would you have for imagination? 
  [Fini] For keeping my opponents off balance. 
  [Padellaro] A definition for Francesco Cossiga? 
  [Fini] The Unfinished. 
  [Padellaro] Why unfinished? 
  [Fini] He was fantastic when he realized that the system was 
collapsing, when, as president of the republic, he broached the 
issue of renewal by taking a pick to it. However, when it was 
time to rebuild, he disappeared. 
  [Padellaro] And what associations does Giovanni Spadolini 
bring to mind? 
  [Fini] Well, beatific tranquillity. No false notes, and no 
screeching. 
  [Padellaro] Which members of the old nomenclature are worth 
saving in your opinion? 
  [Fini] Very few, or rather none. 
  [Padellaro] And President Scalfaro? 
  [Fini] He acquitted himself very well during the election 
campaign. He was impartial and, when necessary, he defended 
national unity. 
  [Padellaro] So he can stay on at the Quirinale. 
  [Fini] Scalfaro is the last president of the old republic. 
If the new one is born, it is inevitable that he must step down. 
  [Padellaro] So all power will be vested in the Pole for 
Freedom? 
  [Fini] Of the three of us, I have been the only one to say 
that the lower house and senate speakers can be elected with a 
wider majority, as they are institutional appointments. 
  [Padellaro] Which features of fascism do you think ought to 
live on in Italy today? 
  [Fini] The attempt that fascism made to give our populace 
dignity. The ability to get things done that transformed little 
agricultural Italy, as it was in 1919, into a socially advanced 
nation. 
  [Padellaro] A quality in which you would like to take after 
Mussolini? 
  [Fini] Oh my God.... 
  [Padellaro] His autocratic style? The magnetism that he 
exerted so skillfully? 
  [Fini] No, no. I think that the one thing a secretary of 
National Alliance has to avoid is being compared with Mussolini. 
  [Padellaro] Oh come on, do not overdo it. There must be 
something you admire in him. 
  [Fini] Yes, the concordat, the reconciliation between state 
and church. Not for nothing the pope called him a man of 
providence. 
  [Padellaro] And your other great mentor, Giorgio Almirante? 
Did he ever have the feeling that there was no room for the 
Right any more? 
  [Fini] The split in '76 had very grave consequences for the 
party. 
  [Padellaro] Did Almirante ever imagine the MSI in 
government? 
  [Fini] I remember that he told some of us in '78 or '79: "My 
generation will never see our ideas get into government, but 
yours will." 
  [Padellaro] Have you ever beaten a communist up? 
  [Fini] I have given as good as I got, but I have never been 
a 
prize fighter in my life. 
<H5>  D'Alema Is More Dangerous </H5>
  [Padellaro] How did you get on with communist students when 
you were at university? 
  [Fini] With some you could reason, talk about things, 
perhaps 
as you would in a drawing room with friends who have different 
ideas. Then there were those who said that killing a fascist 
was not a crime. 
  [Padellaro] And in parliament? 
  [Fini] I have known PCI [Italian Communist Party], then PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] deputies of great substance and 
great ability. And I have met some who were real animals. 
  [Padellaro] Name names. 
  [Fini] I prefer not to talk about the animals. A left-winger 
that I respect is Farniano Crucianelli of Communist Renewal, a 
highly civilized person with whom I have peaceful discussions 
and play soccer. 
  [Padellaro] Do you see anything in the communist ideology 
worth saving? 
  [Fini] Nothing whatsoever. Communism has not been defeated 
in a world war; it collapsed by itself because it no longer 
responded to the needs of the peoples concerned. 
  [Padellaro] Berlusconi continues to identify the PDS 
disparagingly with the old PCI. Do you think this is right? 
  [Fini] No, I call them PDS members or postcommunists. What I 
mean is that I accept that they no longer call themselves 
communists. 
  [Padellaro] What has the PDS taken over from the old style 
of 
communism? 
  [Fini] Illiberality. For example, for the Left of a certain 
type, an opponent has to be criminalized as soon as he proves 
dangerous. 
  [Padellaro] Do you feel criminalized by the Left? 
  [Fini] The Left has assumed a schizophrenic attitude to me. 
I was criminalized from 21 November to 5 December 1993, which 
was when I might have become mayor of Rome. Then I was a 
fascist. Afterwards, when Rutelli had won, I became a fair, 
correct opponent. 
  [Padellaro] Nevertheless, the progressives did not treat you 
too badly during the recent election campaign. 
  [Fini] While I disagreed with Berlusconi, they told him: 
"You cannot form an alliance with the fascists, otherwise you 
will become the black knight. Then, when the alliance was 
formed, they turned to me and said: `Are you crazy? Someone 
like you with a certain social element forming an alliance with 
the capitalist, an enemy of the workers.'" 
  [Padellaro] Is the fair play that the PDS has largely shown 
you merely tactical? 
  [Fini] No, I do not think so. When Occhetto and D'Alema say 
that there must be a European Right in Italy, I believe they 
mean it, if only because a European Left needs a European Right 
in a two-party system. 
  [Padellaro] Which is better: Occhetto or D'Alema? 
  [Fini] They are two very different people. 
  [Padellaro] How do they differ? 
  [Fini] D'Alema is much colder, more methodical, more lucid, 
more determined, a real product of the party school. Occhetto 
has a penchant for witty remarks. On a human level, I like him 
better, but politically speaking, D'Alema is much more dangerous. 
  [Padellaro] Once you are in government, will your party 
reopen the issue of autonomy for the Alto Adige region? 
  [Fini] We feel the time has come to open a sort of second 
package to give the Italians equality with the Germans. 
  [Padellaro] And Istria must become Italian again? 
  [Fini] First of all, the Italian character of the area must 
be protected under a bilateral treaty. However, the frontier 
question remains an open one. 
  [Padellaro] How can your nationalism be reconciled with the 
League's federalism? 
  [Fini] I would describe myself as patriotic rather than 
nationalist. 
  [Padellaro] Is Bossi patriotic? 
  [Fini] Not in my view, indeed I do not even know if he is 
aware of the distinction between native country and nation. 
  [Padellaro] But what brand of federalism can AN [National 
Alliance] accept? 
  [Fini] Our brand of federalism is compatible solely with the 
presidential republic, like the United States. The League's 
macroregions run the risk of shattering what little we have left 
in terms of national identity and state. 
  [Padellaro] Are you in favor of the Europe that emerges from 
the Treaty of Maastricht? 
  [Fini] It is an unequal match for Italy. It is as if the 
Solbiatese [minor soccer team] were to challenge Milan. 
Something has to be changed. 
  [Padellaro] And what must Italy call for at the forthcoming 
G-7 summit in Naples? 
  [Fini] That Europe pay strategic attention to the 
Mediterranean basin and the Middle East. The new trading 
markets are to the south, particularly now that peace may well 
break out between the Israelis and the Palestinians. 
  [Padellaro] Talking of Arabs and Jews, which side does your 
heart beat on? 
  [Fini] The trouble is that both sides are right. However, my 
sympathy was with Israel during the `67 war. I admired their 
military organization, the structure of their state. But I was 
15 years old at the time. 
  [Padellaro] The death penalty. Are you [plural] still in 
favor? 
  [Fini] It is not a matter of current priority, and we have 
never called for the reintroduction of capital punishment. 
  [Padellaro] And what do you call for? 
  [Fini] We demand that the sentences laid down in the penal 
code be served right to the end. I believe that 30 years in 
jail means civil death for a man, but they must be 30 years in 
jail and not 10 that then become eight with concessions and may 
even be reduced to six. 
<H5>  Craxi? Off To Work in a Factory! </H5>
  [Padellaro] Is it time to bring the kickback city 
investigations to an end? 
  [Fini] To bring them to a proper end, those found guilty 
must 
give back their ill-gotten gains. 
  [Padellaro] Do you want to see Bettino Craxi in jail? 
  [Fini] I want to see Craxi get up at half past six every 
morning, catch a bus, go to the factory, clock on, and find 1.5 
million lire in his pay packet at the end of the month. It 
seems to me a fitting punishment for a symbol of corruption 
under 60 years of age. Let us have those over 60, on the other 
hand, live on the welfare pension, which is undoubtedly the 
harshest sentence. 
  [Padellaro] The RAI [Italian Radio and Television]. 
  [Fini] It must remain public, but under completely new 
management. This leveling of debts must cease. 
  [Padellaro] And what about the media? 
  [Fini] We call for true pluralism, guaranteed by the 
professionalism of the journalists. 
  [Padellaro] The name of a television journalist that you 
cannot stand? 
  [Fini] Look, journalists with a political bias do not bother 
me, provided they do the job well. Santoro is factious in the 
extreme, but he is certainly no fool. What I cannot stand is a 
factious fool. 
  [Padellaro] So Santoro can go on presenting "Il Rosso e Il 
Nero" [The Red and the Black]? 
  [Fini] I would have nothing against leaving him there. It is 
the Santoro clones who are unbearable. 
  [Padellaro] For example? 
  [Fini] For example, there is a journalist who reads the TG3 
[Channel 3 news] press survey in the evening, a woman who even 
gets her accents wrong, who cannot even read Italian. I should 
like to know how she got where she is. She will undoubtedly be 
carrying the right party card. 
  [Padellaro] And which of the Fininvest newscasters is 
better, 
Fede or Mentana? 
  [Fini] From the professional point of view, Mentana. 
  [Padellaro] And your top favorite television journalist? 
  [Fini] Gad Lerner. And Giuliano Ferrara as well. 
  [Padellaro] Are there a lot of people wanting to jump on 
your 
bandwagon now? 
  [Fini] I have been noticing in the last few days that the 
national sport is not soccer but the running jump onto the 
winners' car. We have the world champions at this sport, as I 
think Berlusconi is noticing as well. 
  [Padellaro] How about naming a few specialists? 
  [Fini] Mainly top civil servants and managers with 
state-held 
corporations, the RAI, and the banks, figures that would not 
even have given me the time of day a few days ago but are now 
calling me obsequiously: My dear fellow, how are you.... No, 
we shall not let ourselves be corrupted by those who have 
undergone last-minute conversions. 
  [Padellaro] Whey did you decide not to be a member of the 
government? 
  [Fini] Along with a small number of friends, I had the 
winning idea of National Alliance, which is now the 
third-largest party in the country. Now I want to devote my 
energies entirely to pursuing a strategy that sets out to 
achieve right-wing government. 
  [Padellaro] The Right on its own? 
  [Fini] Not even the DC [Christian Democratic Party] managed 
to govern Italy on its own. Let us say the Right in a 
constantly consolidated position. 
  [Padellaro] Abortion. Will you call for the law to be 
amended? 
  [Fini] The right to life must be guaranteed. The right to 
abortion as a last resort must be guaranteed only in cases of 
rape or when the mother's life is at risk. I reject the view of 
abortion as basically a method of contraception. 
  [Padellaro] Convincing Pannella will be no easy matter if 
you 
go into government with him. 
  [Fini] There is no doubt about that. But he will definitely 
not convince us. 
  [Padellaro] Drugs? 
  [Fini] The referendum abolishing the principle whereby drug 
abuse is an illegal deed that should be punished was madness, 
and it must be remedied. We also call for a more determined 
defense of family values. 
  [Padellaro] How? 
  [Fini] For instance, giving homosexual unions legal 
recognition would be a violation of principle. 
<H5>  The Flame Remains </H5>
  [Padellaro] Racial intolerance? 
  [Fini] It must be stamped out with the utmost severity, but 
the Martelli Act [on immigration] needs rewriting. There is a 
limit beyond which integration is not possible, if we do not 
want an outbreak of xenophobic tension and agitation. 
  [Padellaro] Your comrade Buontempo is crusading against 
prostitution and the transvestites. Are you in favor of 
bringing back brothels? 
  [Fini] I am not very up on this issue. However, I would tend 
to be skeptical about legalization. 
  [Padellaro] Has any book been of fundamental significance to 
you? 
  [Fini] Giuseppe Prezzolini's Il Manifesto dei 
Conservatori [The Conservatives' Manifesto]. Until I read 
the book, I had always been convinced that conservative was a 
pejorative term. 
  [Padellaro] What was it that persuaded you to join the 
Right? 
  [Fini] My aversion for the arrogance and barbarism of a 
certain type of left wing. And a movie. 
  [Padellaro] Which movie? 
  [Fini] The John Wayne movie, "The Green Berets," the one 
about American intervention in Vietnam. I was 17, and a Lotta 
Continua [Continuous Struggle] picket wanted to stop me going 
into the cinema. The day after, there was a placard at school 
saying "Fini, you fascist, you're first on the list." So I 
said, hell, you just want to go a movie and you end up 
pilloried. The only ones who took my side were the guys from 
Giovane Italia [Young Italy]. 
  [Padellaro] Do you think that the preconceived hostility to 
fascism has died out now? 
  [Fini] Antifascism served to legitimize the old communist 
party in Italy. Perhaps it no longer serves any purpose now, 
but if it did, it would be revived, make no mistake about that. 
  [Padellaro] A lot of right-wing youths were seen giving the 
Roman salute during your election victory celebrations. 
  [Fini] This is ritualistic behavior, and it has no political 
significance. Those youths just want to express a need for 
identity. Nevertheless, I hope that our young people will make 
their presence felt in a different manner. 
  [Padellaro] Is it true that the base from which the 
tricolored flame issues in the MSI's emblem represents the 
coffin of the Duce? 
  [Fini] That belongs to the realm of mythology, to the tales 
told around the right-wing fireside. I asked Almirante, and he 
replied that he had heard of it, just as they used to say after 
the war that MSI meant "Mussolini is forever immortal." Really, 
the flame symbolizes boldness, and the object under it is a 
trapezium. 
  [Padellaro] Will the flame symbol survive? 
  [Fini] Yes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alfredo Biondi, deputy speaker of the </F>
Italian Chamber of Deputies and Forza Italia deputy, by Maurizio 
Ricci in Rome; date not given: "Fazio? He Too Is To Resign" -- 
first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- Eliminating the old powers, wherever 
they are, and starting again from the beginning. Alfredo 
Biondi, deputy speaker of the old Chamber of Deputies and 
potential successor to [Chamber speaker] Giorgio Napolitano, 
explains that the logic of the "new broom" is the logic of the 
majority system, and that this requires the majority to assume 
its responsibilities in every area. [passage omitted] 
  [Ricci] What does this [shift to the majority system] mean 
for the office of speaker of the Chamber of Deputies? 
  [Biondi] With the majority system, the majority is 
responsible for leading parliament. 
  [Ricci] In both the Chamber and the Senate? 
  [Biondi] In the Senate, which is the second institutional 
body of the state, tradition demands that the speaker position 
be given to a person with the highest qualifications and who 
also has a certain independence. But in the Chamber too, it is 
important to have someone who can offer reliability and balance. 
I have always guaranteed this and I believe that, in 
parliament, the problem lies in the organization of dissent. 
Consent, the majority already has. Hence the need to secure the 
role of the opposition. For example, if the speaker ought to 
come from the majority, I also find it natural that the 
speaker's office include opposition representatives. 
  [Ricci] And the committees? 
  [Biondi] The majority has always held the chair of the 
committees. 
  [Ricci] But Communist Renewal, for example, maintains that 
this reasoning does not apply to those parliamentary bodies with 
a more specific control function. 
  [Biondi] It is true that I too do not believe that this 
criterion applies to bicameral committees. We can even have 
here chairpersons coming from the opposition. Certainly, to 
them too applies the criterion that the persons appointed should 
guarantee balance and reliability, as has not always been the 
case. 
  [Ricci] And the administration? What criterion ought to 
apply: the American "spoil system," in which the victor in the 
elections changes most of the top levels in the administration, 
or the European one, with a clear separation between state and 
politicians? 
  [Biondi] The European one. 
  [Ricci] Why then does your colleague [Center Union member] 
Costa talk of changing at least 120 state appointments? 
  [Biondi] Costa is talking about a meritocratic reselection, 
not a political purification. The bureaucracy which has 
survived under the protection of ministers has, in recent years, 
been the bastion of conservatism. The minister needs to have 
the courage and the opportunity to select for himself those 
people he wants to work with. 
  [Ricci] Is this what is happening with the "professors" of 
the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] board of directors? 
  [Biondi] Anyone appointed by speakers of chambers which have 
now been dissolved ought to ask himself whether he should remain 
in the post to which he was appointed. 
  [Ricci] And control bodies like CONSOB [Commission for the 
Supervision of Companies and Stock Exchanges] and the Antitrust 
Committee? 
  [Biondi] These are collegiate bodies, where there is the 
possibility of integration, and hence, naturally, of internal 
flexibility. Naturally, anyone finding the new government's 
policies incompatible with his own ideas can always resign. 
  [Ricci] But it is these bodies which will have to examine 
closely the entrepreneurial activities of the probable future 
prime minister. 
  [Biondi] [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi has said that he 
is 
ready to sell and I believe him. Politics, I can assure you, is 
a contagious craft. On the other hand, he has a dominant 
position in television and I am ready to recognize that, without 
this, Forza Italia would still have been successful, but in a 
more limited way. As an old liberal I say that this dominant 
position is incompatible with freedom. 
  [Ricci] One moment. Here we have two different problems. 
One is that of Berlusconi's entrepreneurial activities. 
  [Biondi] And here I am saying that his position today is 
incompatible with the office of prime minister. Even 
politically, he would become a puppet target of a thousand 
polemics. Obviously he is entitled to safeguard his own assets. 
He should not strip himself of everything like Francis of 
Assisi. 
  [Ricci] And the second is that of television pluralism. 
  [Biondi] And here I say that the government is not 
everything. Parliament is sovereign and is able to review the 
Mammi law [on broadcasting], achieving a better pluralism, one 
which excludes duopoly, but, I add as an old liberal, oligopoly 
as well.

  [Text] Mentana, Fede, and Liguori, the chief editors of the 
news bulletins broadcast on the three Fininvest-controlled 
television channels [Canale Cinque, Retequattro, and Italia Uno] 
handed in their resignations a short time ago as a protest 
against the statements made by Franco Tato, the managing 
director of the Fininvest group. He told a newspaper that if 
the Mammi Law [telecommunications law approved last year by 
parliament] did not exist, he would have cancelled all the news 
and information programs on the three channels.

  [Excerpt] Italy has the highest number of AIDS-infected [as 
received] babies in Europe, with 397 cases reported to present. 
This information comes from "The Italian Register of HIV Cases 
in Pediatrics," founded in 1985. 
  This was discussed at the Biotechnology and Aids convention 
in Florence. The high number of pediatric cases is due to 
infection spread between drug addicts and among heterosexuals. 
HIV-positive mothers have given birth to 2,700 babies. [passage

  [Text] About 200 Portuguese immigrants have arrived in 
Lisbon from South Africa, some vowing never to return, fuelling 
fears of a panic-stricken exodus before the elections. However, 
most said they were merely taking an extended break and would 
watch the results of the elections from a safe distance. 
Meanwhile, Lisbon is bracing itself for a stampede of 
Portuguese immigrants if South Africa should plunge into chaos 
after the elections and has already begun contingency plans to 
airlift and temporarily accommodate fleeing nationals.

  [Text] Today is the second day of Boris Yeltsin's official 
visit to our country. The central point today is the signing of 
several agreements, many of them of an economic nature, but 
there is also an outstanding social debt that could lead to a 
solution for the so-called children of the war. Those Spanish 
citizens who left Spain for Russia as children, during or after 
the Spanish Civil War, are now old and their pension status has 
still not been resolved. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports from 
the Moncloa palace: 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] The two leaders have described their 
talks as very interesting. Yeltsin and Gonzalez also agreed 
when they said that Hispano-Russian relations are good, but 
there is much room for improvement. Furthermore, they are 
certain--and it seems they have no doubt from what we have 
heard--that the treaty of friendship and cooperation they signed 
this morning in the Moncloa Palace is going to very quickly step 
up Hispano-Russian relations. Yeltsin said this a few moments 
ago while expressing his disbelief at the present state of 
affairs. 
  The president of the Russian Federation does not understand 
how trade between two great states--he thinks that the Spanish 
state ranks third regarding the quality of life in the 
world--does not reach two percent. 
  Gonzalez also highlighted the treaty of friendship and 
cooperation as a channel that will politically and legally 
regulate the treaties that have been signed during this visit. 
As you know, one of these treaties allows the children of the 
war to get their pension in Spain, and it will not be less than 
the minimum established in our country. In short, this is a 
treaty of friendship and cooperation that, according to the 
Spanish prime minister, is going to be boosted annually and will 
institutionalize Hispano-Russian summit meetings at the highest 
level. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] This agreement contains the 
commitment to hold at least two formal meetings between the 
foreign ministers every year and a meeting at the highest level 
every year. [end recording] 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] And, finally, to end with a human touch 
but no less interesting. Boris Yeltsin has challenged all of us 
here at the news conference to enjoy a state of health like his, 
at the age of 57, by playing tennis and swimming in the Black 
Sea with a water temperature of four degrees.

  [Begin Solana recording] According to the latest information 
I have at my disposal, right now I can say that about 25 
Spaniards are on the verge of leaving, a certain number have 
already left, and there are 25 ready to leave. I think that 
they will be able to leave at 1400. That is the mainly good 
news I can give, but as I say, overall it is a bad picture 
because the situation in Rwanda is still very unpleasant, very 
bad. [end recording] 
  The Spanish Government is in permanent contact with France 
and Belgium, the countries which are coordinating the evacuation 
of nationals. Spain has offered two Hercules transport planes 
to help with the evacuation. So a unit of the Legion's special 
operations group is on stand-by should it be needed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Calls On People's Party for </F>
Effort To Present New Proposals"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar 
yesterday called on his party's leaders for an effort to draw up 
new proposals for the coming elections in the course of his 
speech before the People's Party Executive Committee. The 
People's Party leadership yesterday began to prepare its 
strategy for the state of the nation debate, scheduled for two 
weeks hence, after reviewing the political developments of the 
past few days, especially the atmosphere of corruption, the 
so-called democratic impetus talks, and the coming election 
campaigns. 
  At its first meeting since Easter Week, the Executive 
Committee heard a report from Mariano Rajoy on the European and 
Andalusian elections, scheduled for June, before giving the 
People's Party chairman the floor. 
<H5>  Satisfaction </H5>
  Jose Maria Aznar discussed with his party's leaders the 
latest opinion polls published, expressing his satisfaction at 
the favorable prospects for the People's Party. Despite this, 
he called on the party for a greater effort, especially in its 
capacity of presenting new proposals, warning that the election 
campaigns, in which the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
will be bound to start to recover, will be beginning soon. 
  The People's Party leadership then discussed the atmosphere 
of corruption existing in Spain, but without entering into 
specific cases. Sources in the main opposition party expressed 
with concern the idea that, despite the latest cases which have 
appeared in the press, the government is taking no steps to 
tackle the phenomenon. 
  Bearing in mind that corruption is persisting, some People's 
Party leaders called for the resubmission of the package of 
ethical regeneration measures which the People's Party group 
brought before the house in the previous legislative term and 
which was rejected by the PSOE. This option could be readopted 
within the next few weeks. 
  The state of the talks on the so-called democratic impetus 
was also examined. The People's Party says that it is prepared 
to reach an agreement, but maintains its stance that 
regeneration requires revitalizing the institutions; that is, 
something more than simply changing personnel or merely sharing 
out power among the parties. It also insists that the vacancies 
-- from the ombudsman to the Spanish Radio and Television 
Company board -- must be filled jointly, since all laws are 
equal and all must be obeyed. 
  With respect to the Congress [of Deputies] standing orders, 
the People's Party reaffirms its opposition to the PSOE's latest 
proposal, deeming it "standpat." 
  Last, the National Executive Committee began to prepare the 
People's Party's strategy for the coming state of the nation 
debate. The first proposals were made, and Aznar outlined what 
could be his speech at that parliamentary session. However, no 
details have been made known, on the grounds that "it would not 
be advisable to reveal strategies."

Hesitate To Strike"] 
  [Text] Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen fully 
backs the decision to bomb Serb positions near the Bosnian town 
of Gorazde. 
  "In the light of the information made available, it is clear 
that it was the correct decision and the Serbs should not be 
surprised. The UN Security Council has decided that the United 
Nations may ask for air support -- and this is what has 
happened. The UN forces in the region have felt themselves hard 
pressed and have therefore asked for air support," the Danish 
foreign minister said. 
  He stressed that the Serbs are the aggressors who are 
forcing 
their way into an area which the United Nations has already 
described as a safe area. The Danish foreign minister also said 
that the Serb aggression has come at a surprising point in time 
when "there was a hope that more peaceful developments were 
underway. And then suddenly the Serbs launch this massive 
attack on one of the safe areas." 
  A spokeswoman for UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
said yesterday evening that the general secretary had not 
hesitated to use force in the defense of the Muslim enclave of 
Gorazde. Nor will he hesitate to do so again, spokeswoman 
Therese Gastaut said.

<F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "SMP May Lose Representation in </F>
Parliament"] 
  [Excerpts] The Rural Party's long continuing decline 
speeded up last week when the party's favorite and presidential 
candidate Sulo Aittoniemi quit the party's parliamentary 
delegation [to join the Center Party group]. The party garnered 
only 1.4 percent in the Gallup poll published by HELSINGIN 
SANOMAT on Saturday [26 March]. The SMP [Finnish Rural Party] 
could be swept out of parliament in the next election. 
  There are several reasons for SMP's decline. In the views of 
many the party has argued itself into the ground. This is 
denied, however, in a statement released on Sunday by Party 
Secretary Timo Soini. 
  "An attempt is being made to destroy the SMP," Soini 
asserted 
in his news release. 
  "Our parliamentary delegation has been thrown into disarray 
especially by money. There is no one who has not been selling 
out," Soini stated. He saw the biggest scapegoats outside of 
SMP, but also saw that the SMP "has to clean up its own house. 
There must be no room for those who threaten and gamble." 
<H5>  Parliamentary Representatives in Difficulty </H5>
  The party's prospects in the 1995 elections seem dismal. 
Only 
SMP Chairman Rimo Vistbacka is starting from a moderately 
favorable position for the parliamentary elections. He has had 
solid support from Pohjanmaa voters since 1987. Chances of 
continuing in parliament for most other SMP representatives are 
for differing reasons hanging in the balance. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  "Everything Adrift" </H5>
  The SMP is entering the election campaign in poor condition 
in other respects also. The Justice Ministry has handed over the 
party's economic backbone, the SMP Support Foundation, to 
court-appointed trustees. 
  The party's debts amount to 3-4 million markkas. Secured 
loans are still being found. On the other hand, the party's 
newspaper publishing company is in continuous economic 
difficulty. [passage omitted] 
  Soini described the party's situation as "everything 
adrift." 
Matters are not being taken care of by anyone. Vistback is 
overcautious, does not dare to make decisions, does not take a 
stand, nor bang his fist on the table. [passage omitted] 
  Other parties consider the SMP an outcast. It is only to be 
accepted as a campaign alliance partner in extreme emergency. 
For example, campaign alliance master SKL [Finnish Christian 
Party] takes the SMP along where the Center Party does not care 
to join in alliance. [passage omitted] 
  The SMP may find itself in an extraordinary situation at the 
party convention this June in Tampere: it cannot be ruled out 
that there will be no seriously acceptable candidates for party 
leadership posts, or even any challengers to the present 
leaders. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SDP Wants To Have More Active </F>
Employment Policy"] 
  [Excerpt] The SDP [Social Democratic 
Party] envisages a sustainable economic growth containing a 
job-creation element. The economy's future and employment must 
be supported through a broadly conceived program for adult 
education and an active labor market policy. To reduce 
unemployment a decision is needed which is based on voluntarism 
and on agreement among the labor market parties. This is what 
the SDP said in a motion on jobs policy which the party 
delegates approved in its meeting on Wednesday [16 March]. 
  In its 21-point employment stimulus program, the SDP 
promises 
100,000 new jobs or training slots this year. It is estimated 
that state funding should be increased by 2.5 billion [markkas]. 
This would increase the pressure for added borrowing this year, 
but lead to decreased expenditures in coming years. 
  A low interest rate would be the main goal for monetary 
policy. 
  An investment program targeting improvements in 
transportation, education, research, and product development as 
main areas would be sought. 
  Taxation must be quickly eased to increase domestic demand. 
The tax rate for workers and pensioners must be reduced by at 
least 1.5 percent. 
  The reform with the value-added tax should be delayed to 
improve employment prospects in the private sector. 
  To ease unemployment in the construction sector there should 
be spending on renovating residences. 
  An increased effort in adult education and a guaranteed 
subsidized job after 500 days of unemployment are other SDP 
model proposals. 
  Unemployment compensation must be converted from the system 
of passive subsidies to one with a more active job protection. 
  With regard to incomes policy, the demands for solidarity 
and 
competitiveness must be combined. In wage pacts there must be a 
goal-directed attempt to improve the employment situation. 
  The possibilities of taking training or sabbatical leave for 
periods of three to 12 months must be facilitated, on condition 
that an unemployed worker can be hired through this. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Increased Norwegian National Debt </F>
Worries Central Bank Chief"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- "Regardless of whether the price of oil 
rises to $18 or more, it is still necessary to make cuts in 
public spending in Norway. Otherwise the result will be that we 
too build up a huge state debt," Torstein Moland, Norwegian 
Central Bank chief, said. 
  Even though most of the curves are positive for Norway at 
present there is one that is falling sharply -- that which shows 
state assets. When at their highest, these were over 200 
billion kronor in 1990. A couple of years earlier the 
government began an expansive finance policy which threatens to 
wipe out the whole of the Norway's fortune before 1997. 
  Torstein Moland took up his post at the beginning of the 
year. As a result of a private investment, which is now the 
subject of a police investigation, he has already been the 
target of tougher criticism than any of his predecessors. 
Nevertheless he is determined not to tell the Norwegians things 
they would prefer to hear. But he has the same educational 
problems as everyone else who tries to explain how the Norwegian 
economy hangs together. 
  Why be worried when Norway is the only country in the OECD 
which does not have a national debt, which has lower interest 
rates than Germany, which has improved its competitiveness by 12 
percent over five years, and whose Central Bank has not needed 
to intervene in the currency market since 1992? 
  "It is tempting and quite understandable to breathe a sigh 
of 
relief when optimism returns to the Norwegian economy and to be 
happy about the upturn we we can see coming. But it is 
indefensible," Torstein Moland said. 
  He warned that Norway like other countries must adapt itself 
to structural changes which go deeper than the shifts in the 
market. 
  "Compared with other countries we had the advantage of 
building up an oil fortune in the eighties. But the freedom of 
action we have had thanks to it is now largely a thing of the 
past. There are not many countries which have spent money at 
the same rate as Norway without acquiring serious national 
financial problems." 
  Torstein Moland pointed out that Norway's surplus in its 
balance of payments is also a result of the fact that there has 
been too little investment in mainland industry. 
  "We need a large sector that is exposed to competition. 
Simply increasing oil production is not enough. Even though 
the Norwegian Bank is not expecting prices to rise by more than 
a couple of percent this year, there is still a certain amount 
of uncertainty. 
  ``We have never been in a situation in which unemployment 
falls from the high level we have had for several years. It is 
possible that despite unemployment levels, shortages will occur. 
In the construction sector there are already signs that there 
will be a shortage of qualified labor when construction takes 
off again at the same time as large public projects, such as a 
new main airport, are carried out.'' 
  Thus Torstein Moland's message to Finance Minister Sigbjorn 
Johnsen is that the national budget should show a surplus as 
soon as possible. 
  The budget deficit for 1994 is the equivalent of 3 percent 
of 
GNP. "It is only now that we can begin to tighten our belts 
without strangling economic growth," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Nygaard: "One of Four Out"] </F>
  [Text] There will be more than 6,000 fewer in the defense 
forces in the next 10 years. That means about one-fourth of the 
personnel. 
  Yesterday State Secretary Sigve Brekke presented the 
Storting 
a report on reorganization in the military. This will be the 
greatest change any government sector has ever experienced. It 
is to be done without any dismissals. 
  The officers' organizations are protesting, because the 
Ministry of Defense wants to eliminate the right to employment 
following graduation from the first level of the Defense School. 
This means that officers will only get permanent employment 
after they have been accepted to the second level. 
  The Central Organization of Officers and the Norwegian 
Officers Union are reacting to the plan that makes officers only 
temporary employees for up to six years before granting them 
permanent employment. The defense chief and the Federation of 
Labor Unions are against this change. 
  Officers enjoy particularly good conditions compared with 
other groups: full salary while in training, a right to a 
position afterward, and extremely good protection against losing 
one's job. Brekke said that with a restructuring of the 
magnitude the defense forces are now facing there has to be 
greater flexibility when hiring. 
<H5>  24,OOO Employed </H5>
  The defense forces have about 24,000 employees, which means 
about one-fourth must go. The Ministry of Defense is going to 
establish a resource organization to help each individual who 
finds himself superfluous in the transition. There will be a 
number of measures taken to stimulate departures. 
  After the slimming-down has been completed, defense costs 
for 
personnel will have been reduced by about 1.6 billion kroner per 
year. In accordance with the long-term defense plan, these 
savings will be used to improve the standard of materiel. 
  "I share the officers' view, and the consequences for the 
professionals' education worry me. Still, this is better than I 
had anticipated. I expected the government to suggest 
eliminating the right to a salary during training," Hans J. 
Rosjorde (Progress Party), chairman of the Defense Committee, 
said.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the UN 
Secretariat General has significantly altered the first package, 
which it claimed could not be changed, in favor of the Greek 
Cypriots. 
  Denktas assessed the statement Joe Clark, UN special envoy 
to 
Cyprus, made to reporters in New York. Denktas said that the 
benefits and rights promised to the Turkish Cypriot side in the 
first package have not yet been fulfilled, adding that the 
Turkish Cypriot side has been told that if it hands over Maras 
[Varosha] some of these promises will be kept. He said: This 
is most unreliable. Pointing out that the promises made to the 
Turkish Cypriot side should be kept, Denktas added that the 
changes made against the Turkish Cypriot side are not just 
details but substantial issues. He further pointed out that the 
promises made have been rescinded. Noting that the southern 
entrance to Maras should be kept under Turkish Cypriot control, 
Denktas said that this is an issue of vital importance for the 
Turkish Cypriots. He added that the UN secretary general's 
promise concerning this issue is not remembered by anyone but 
the Turkish Cypriot side. Pointing out that promises made on 
the Lefkosa [Nicosia] airport have also not been kept, Denktas 
said that this disrupts the equality but that no one seems to 
care. 
  Denktas reiterated that the Turkish Cypriot side is in favor 
of continuing the proximity talks, adding that the talks have 
been ended because of Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis. He said: 
We are continuing our contacts with the UN officials. We will 
see what will happen in four weeks.

  [Excerpt] (TURKISH CYPRIOT NEWS AGENCY)--Greek Cypriot 
police pressure on Turkish Cypriots living in south Cyprus, who 
make up a community of 1,000 people, assumed appalling 
dimensions following the assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis. 
Turkish Cypriot Ilker Denizci crossed to the Greek Cypriot side 
after being misled by Greek Cypriot propaganda on 4 March 1994. 
He hoped to earn money to have a better life. But Denizci was 
detained by Greek Cypriot civilian police officials in a village 
in the British base area in Akrotiri and taken to the police 
center in Limassol. He was accused of being a Turkish agent. 
Denizci worked as a skilled construction worker. He was 
hastily interrogated. A police official named Andreas [no 
surname as published], nearly 1.70 meters tall, insulted him by 
saying: Dirty dog, we do not want you here. You must all go 
away. 
  Denizci was then mercilessly tortured with electrical 
batons, 
metal bars, and sticks for hours. Cigarettes were applied to 
various parts of his body and an electrical current was applied 
to the more sensitive areas. He was later taken to a village in 
the foothills of the Troodos Mountains in a jeep. Denizci was 
savagely beaten there. He was later forced to sign two 
documents saying that he would not return to the Greek Cypriot 
side and that the Greek Cypriot police treated him well. 
Denizci was placed in a cell-like room after signing the 
documents. Four Greek Cypriot civilian police armed with 
Kalashnikov rifles took Denizci to an area near the Greek 
Cypriot positions across from Doganci [Elea] at about 2200 on 
Thursday [8 April]. He was mercilessly beaten, dragged to the 
ground, kicked, hit repeatedly on the head with hand gun butts, 
and punched in the face for nearly 20 minutes. The Greek 
Cypriot police officials then took the 370 Cyprus pounds he had 
saved while working on the Greek Cypriot side for nearly six 
weeks and forced him to leave and go to the Turkish positions in 
the area. 
  Denizci cannot walk because of the merciless torture. His 
body is covered with injuries and he is receiving medical 
treatment in the Burhan Nalbantoglu Hospital in Nicosia. 
Denizci held a news conference in the hospital yesterday.

  [Text] Athens, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Greek Defence Minister 
Yerasimos Arsenis said Tuesday [12 April] that Greek crews, 
objecting to NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions near 
Gorazde, would no longer fly NATO AWACS planes. 
  Following a general staff meeting which has been in session 
overnight, Arsenis said that Greece would withdraw its only 
warship from the Adriatic if NATO marines became engaged in NATO 
actions against Bosnian Serbs. 
  He said that AWACS planes were not flying out of the NATO 
base in Aktio in northwestern Greece and that they had all been 
transferred to the NATO base in Aviano, Italy. 
  On April 10-11, NATO warplanes launched air strikes on 
Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde, after Serb forces had 
crushed a Moslem offensive, mounted in early March from the 
"safe area" of Gorazde, which should have been demilitarized 
last spring. 
  However, Greek opposition parties found Greece's 
disassociation with the NATO action against Bosnian Serbs as 
insufficient and urged the government, despite Greece's NATO 
membership, to intervene promptly to avert the flaring up of the 
Bosnian conflict. 
  The United Left, the Communist Party of Greece and the 
Political Spring party said there was no justification for the 
NATO attack on Bosnian Serbs and added that it only served to 
the intrests of the West. 
  A conservative, New Democracy Party leader Miltiadis Evert 
late on Monday urged that Greece, currently holding the rotating 
presidency of the European Union (E.U.), should interfere with 
the European allies to help stop NATO actions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today 
that Greece regrets the incident on the Greek-Albanian border 
and stressed that when real incidents occur, Greece is willing 
to cooperate to clear up the issue on the level of the judicial 
authorities. Venizelos noted that Greece will not get carried 
away by the climate of tension cultivated by the Albanian side, 
because its goal is to safeguard peace in the southern Balkans. 
  The spokesman added that the only information Greece has in 
connection with these incidents is that provided by the Albanian 
side. Venizelos added: No one can rule out the existence of 
extremist elements but these are elements that are handled by a 
state that operates in an excellent fashion. The spokesman 
concluded by saying that Greece will accept no provocation 
against it.

  [Text] The Tirana government has asked Khristos Iakovou, 
the Greek consul general in Gjirokaster, to leave Albanian 
territory within 48 hours. The Albanian Government made this 
provocative decision following the badly devised provocation the 
other day about an alleged attack by Greeks against the guard 
post of Ano Episkopi [Peshkepia] near the Greek-Albanian border. 
In its decision to expel the Greek diplomat, the Albanian 
Government notes that his activities are incompatible with his 
duties. 
  Our Ioannina correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis has reported 
that Mr. Iakovou will leave Gjirokaster on Thursday [14 April]. 
The Greek consul's expulsion caused a reaction within the Greek 
minority but there have been no incidents. The assessment in 
the area is that the Sali Berisha government is trying to create 
an artificial tension in Greek-Albanian relations following the 
failure of the provocation about an alleged Greek attack against 
the Albanian military camp. The Tirana government is now trying 
to relate the expulsion of the Greek diplomat to the attack by 
unidentified gunmen in Ano Episkopi. 
  According to press reports, the first secretary of the 
Albanian Embassy in Athens will be expelled. The news report 
has also been carried by REUTER, which noted that, according to 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas, the Greek 
Government made this decision as soon as it was informed that 
Greek Consul General in Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou had been 
declared persona non grata and had been given 48 hours to leave 
Albania.

  [Text] Athens, April 13 (AFP)--An extreme Greek nationalist 
weekly called Wednesday [13 April] for the seizure of the 
southern Albanian port of Sarande, situated opposite the Aegean 
island of Corfu. 
  The publication, STOKHOS, hailed an attack launched Sunday 
by 
a nationalist commando on an Albanian Army barracks in which two 
people were killed, sparking a diplomatic crisis between Tirana 
and Athens. 
  It dismissed as a forgery a leaflet claiming the attack by a 
Greek group calling itself the Northern Ipirus Liberation Front. 
  Northern Ipirus is the traditional name for southern 
Albania, 
which has a substantial Greek-speaking minority. 
  "We are going to take Sarande from them whatever they do 
because we are stronger than they are and we have the law on our 
side," the publication said. 
  STOKHOS, which has a 10,000 print run, also called on the 
Greek Army to attack Skopje, capital of The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, with whom Athens is in dispute over the 
name of the country which is also that of its northern province. 
  Last month STOKHOS said that "self-defence groups" had been 
formed in eight villages in southern Albania with large 
Greek-speaking populations. 
  On Tuesday Albania asked the United Nations Security Council 
to condemn the attack, which it said was launched by a "Greek 
terrorist commando of six to seven persons" wearing Greek Army 
uniforms. The commando attacked a barracks for new recruits 
about four kilometers (2.5 miles) inside Albanian territory. A 
sentry and captain were killed. 
  Albania recalled its ambassador to Athens for consultations 
and expelled the Greek consul general from southern Gjirokaster 
following the attack, sparking a tit-for-tat expulsion of an 
Albanian diplomat from Athens.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirela Kalostipi--recorded] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ambassador of new Yugoslavia [as heard] Milan 
Milutinovic in fact visited the Maximos Palace last night and 
had an approximately one-half-hour meeting with the prime 
minister. Mr. Mulutinovic also visited Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias at the Foreign Ministry this morning. According to a 
government spokesman's statement at noon today, the subject of 
discussion was developments in Bosnia. Despite all this, and 
although Mr. Milutinovic was asked last night what he discussed 
with the prime minister, and he said that he had conveyed a 
message, when we asked government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos 
what the message was about he said that the important thing is 
that the developments in Bosnia were discussed and that there is 
nothing more that can be released. In addition, Mr. Venizelos 
described as extremely unpleasant the fact that there is war in 
his area. The spokesman made this statement in response to a 
question on whether the fear that the war will expand to the 
south is justified. Mr. Venizelos reiterated that it is 
Greece's opinion that neighboring countries or countries with 
historic relations in the region should not become involved in 
the areas of tension. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the tension created in Greek-Albanian relations, 
this tension escalated after Tirana declared the Greek consul 
general in Gjirokaster persona non grata. Mr. Khristos Iakovou 
was told by the Albanian authorities to leave Albania within 48 
hours. This move followed the well-known incident at a military 
camp guard post in the Gjirokaster area [words indistinct] and 
the Albanian insistence on accusing Greece openly through 
letters to international organizations, the United Nations, 
European Union, and the CSCE of being responsible for this 
incident. 
  The government spokesman said once again in this connection 
that these accusations are unfounded and, in any case, our 
country reacted to the Albanian Government's decision to expel 
the consul general in Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou. Our country 
reacted by declaring Kastriot Robo, first secretary at the 
Albanian Embassy in Athens, persona non grata. He was asked by 
the Foreign Ministry to leave our country within 48 hours. 
Despite all this, the Greek Government expresses its regret for 
these developments for which, according to a Foreign Ministry 
statement, the whole responsibility is born by the Albanian 
side. Albania, because of the recent criminal incident on its 
territory by unidentified elements, is trying to create a 
climate of bilateral tension. The Foreign Ministry statement 
further notes that the government has not spared any effort to 
support the Albanian people's efforts for the reconstruction of 
their country and expects the Albanian side to demonstrate the 
necessary responsibility to overcome the current tension to the 
benefit of security and stability in the region.

  [Text] The official talks between Turkey and Croatia were 
held in Ankara today. An air transportation agreement was 
signed between the two countries. 
  Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister who arrived in Ankara this morning, called on Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin and conferred with him for some time. 
Later, talks were held between delegations headed by the 
foreign ministers of the two countries. 
  In a statement before the meeting, Cetin noted that there 
are 
historical ties between Turkey and Croatia and expressed the 
belief that economic and political relations will develop even 
further. Cetin remarked that the Serbs should also take part in 
the Washington agreement signed between Bosnians and Croatians. 
The Washington agreement is important in creating a 
multinational and multicultural Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin 
stressed. Expressing gratitude for Croatia's assistance to 
Turkish troop participation in the peace force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin declared that Turkish soldiers will go 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to contribute to peace. 
  In turn, Granic thanked Turkey for its contribution to the 
peace process. Explaining that the Washington agreement is 
important because it grants equal rights to Muslims and 
Croatians, Granic said: It is our aim to get the Serbs to also 
take part in this agreement. 
  Later, Turkey and Croatia signed an air transportation 
agreement. The agreement was signed by Ambassador Tugay 
Ulucevik, deputy under secretary of the Foreign Ministry, and 
Croatian Ambassador to Ankara (Hidayet Vichdivic). The 
agreement envisages bilateral cooperation in the field of civil 
aviation.

  [Text] Both sides share a strong desire for the improvement 
of Croatian-Turkish cooperation, Mate Granic, Croatian vice 
premier and foreign minister, stated in Ankara today following 
talks with his counterpart and host Hikmet Cetin. In the course 
of the talks the two sides signed an agreement on air traffic 
between Croatia and Turkey. Our reporter Andjelko Perincic 
asked both ministers to make brief statements: 
  [Granic] ``Relations between our two countries are 
improving. 
Apart from the agreement signed today we also discussed an 
agreement on friendship and cooperation which will probably be 
signed during President Demirel's visit to Croatia at President 
Tudjman's invitation. 
  ``We also discussed an agreement on economic cooperation 
which will most probably be signed during my visit to Turkey in 
May, when a meeting between Minister Cetin, Prime Minister 
Silajdzic, and myself is to be held. We also discussed a credit 
to be granted by (Ex-Bank) to Zagreb Bank to the tune of $100 
million, which will be activated at the beginning of May during 
a visit of a Zagreb Bank delegation to Ankara. We also talked 
about cultural cooperation, about signing a cultural cooperation 
treaty, and also a transport agreement, the establishment of 
permanent sea lines, and about the help that Turkey can offer 
Croatia for its admission to the Partnership for Peace alliance. 
A Turkish ambassador is to head a NATO delegation during their 
visit to Zagreb.'' 
  [Perincic] Minister Granic announced an initiative to 
establish a joint Turkish-Croatian-Bosnia-Herzegovina bank in 
Sarajevo; Turkey is also to provide help to our country for its 
admission to international financial institutions and the 
rebuilding of the old bridge in Mostar. 
  He also said that Turkey will support the joint 
Croatia-Bosnia-Herzgovina policy and their participation in 
meeting of Islamic countries to be held in Tunisia soon, where a 
report on the Washington agreement will be delivered. Croatia 
should also be a special guest at a meeting of the North 
Atlantic assembly to be held in Ankara soon. 
  As regards NATO's role in the crisis in southeast Europe, 
Turkish Minister Cetin, in the capacity of an official of a 
member of the alliance, stated the following for Croatian Radio 
and TV: 
  [Cetin, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] "We will support Croatia's relation toward NATO as 
a basis for its admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace [as 
heard]. The Turkish ambassador to NATO headquarters in Brussels 
is to head a NATO delegation which is to come to Croatia to 
discuss that issue. I hope that with that support and President 
Tudjman's and Minister Granic's tactfulness, Croatia will 
achieve stability in the Balkans and will win a right decision 
by NATO as regards cooperation with that alliance within the 
Partnership for Peace project." 
  [Announcer] It should be added to this report from Ankara 
that in the Croatian-Turkish ministerial talks the two sides 
also discussed the need to stop the greater Serbian aggression 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to include the Serbs in negotiations 
on the federation [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. They also supported 
NATO air action.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] In a statement after the 
official Turkish-Croatian talks in Ankara today, Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin said that the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans was discussed at the talks. 
Announcing that Turkey's contribution will continue for the 
implementation of the Croatian-Bosnian agreement signed in 
Washington, Cetin remarked that agreement was reached to hold a 
meeting in Ankara with the participation of the foreign 
ministers of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Turkey in a bid to 
put the agreement into effect. He reported that the Turkish 
peace force to be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina was also discussed 
with the Croatian delegation. 
  Cetin declared that agreements on the prevention of double 
taxation, promotion of investments, and economic cooperation 
will be signed as soon as possible with the aim of developing 
Turkish-Croatian relations. Cetin also stated that Turkey and 
Croatia will appoint military attaches to their respective 
embassies and Croatia will open a consulate general in Istanbul. 
Possibilities for bilateral cooperation in the field of defense 
industry will also be explored, Cetin noted, adding that the 
Croatian side welcomed Turkey's contribution on the rebuilding 
of the Mostar Bridge and other cultural works. Cetin announced 
that on 17 April, Croatian Airlines will begin Zagreb-Istanbul 
flights and ro-ro [roll-on/roll-off] connections will also be 
secured. 
  In his statement after the talks between the delegations, 
Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, said that the talks in Ankara were very successful. 
He expressed the belief that bilateral relations will develop 
further with each passing day. Granic remarked that the United 
States, Russia, and the European Union are exerting efforts to 
organize a meeting among the Croatians, Bosnians, and Serbs. 
  Granic was received by President Suleyman Demirel at the 
Cankaya Mansion this afternoon. The visiting minister will 
leave Turkey tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Basak Dogru in Istanbul on 12 April -- recorded, in English with 
superimposed translation into Turkish] 
  [Text] [Dogru] What can you say about the current level 
of relations between Turkey and Israel? 
  [Peres] I think they are full of promises for the future. I 
have many hopes for the future, not only for our countries, but 
also for the Middle East. We can work together in every field. 
There is a broad potential for this. We can develop 
cooperation especially in the economic, technological, 
agricultural, defense, and tourism fields. 
  [Dogru] How do you see the future of the Middle East peace 
process? 
  [Peres] I hope that the negotiations between the PLO and 
Israel will be concluded by the end of this month and 
implementation will begin at the beginning of May. The 
implementation of the framework agreement will constitute the 
first step toward a new Middle East. 
  [Dogru] There is a big massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I 
would like to hear your views on this subject. 
  [Peres] One must not approach the incidents in Bosnia as a 
Muslim-Christian conflict. The only discrimination the 
civilized world is allowed to do is the one between those who 
are killed in this war, that is the victims, and those who cause 
this shame. Civilized communities should side with the innocent 
people who are killed for no reason. They should defend those 
who do not even have the right to defend themselves because of 
the embargo. We feel deep sorrow for the victims of this war. 
  [Dogru] What kind of a future awaits our world, which is 
changing at a head-spinning pace? How can you describe Turkey's 
place in this changing world? 
  [Peres] Turkey must leave the past behind and prepare for 
the next century with its young population. The coming days 
will be accompanied by many problems such as terrorism and the 
environment. No country can look forward to a future without any 
problems. We need more educated people to resolve these 
problems. We must all invest more in educational institutions 
and scientific research organizations.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that 
Turkey is a secular country and it will remain so, adding that 
there is no argument about the government in the country. 
Ciller also revealed that a new package of democratization 
measures to encompass the entire country will soon be announced 
together with Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime 
minister. The prime minister left for the United States to 
conduct contacts. 
  In a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport before her 
departure, Ciller reported that in the United States she will 
meet with President Bill Clinton and hold a series of meetings. 
She said that it is difficult to understand Turkey when you 
look at it from the outside. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] Turkey is also a secular country. 
The Republic of Turkey will remain secular. There is no 
argument about the regime. Sometimes, it may be difficult to 
understand our country when you look at it from the outside. 
Another matter we will explain to the other countries consists 
of the additional moves Turkey will undertake in the field of 
democratization. I met with Mr. Karayalcin before my departure. 
Upon my return, together with Mr. Karayalcin, we will announce 
a package of democratization measures. Turkey will adopt a 
series of measures which will further broaden the scope of 
democracy within the framework of a state of law. In actual 
fact, these measures were also included in our coalition 
protocol. We will embrace these issues with determination. 
  Turkey is a democratic country and it has covered a great 
distance in this direction. It will continue to do so in the 
future. We do have economic problems, but we have already 
adopted very important measures aimed at overcoming these 
problems. Our whole nation supports these measures. Turkey's 
future will become increasingly brighter and it will occupy its 
rightful place in the world as a leading country. [end 
recording] 
  Commenting on her scheduled contacts in the United States, 
Ciller explained that she will deliver a speech at a meeting 
organized by the Elie Wiesel Foundation in New York. In 
Washington, Ciller recounted, she will meet with President 
Clinton and hold contacts with representatives of financial 
circles. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] The main goal of my meetings with 
financial circles will not consist of asking for loans for 
Turkey. The aim is to reinstate the flow of information 
necessary for Turkey's reintegration into the world's money 
markets. As you know, our country is experiencing a period of 
economic difficulties. We are adopting all the necessary 
measures to surmount this problem. We will implement these 
measures as a nation, in solidarity. We will certainly overcome 
the problems. Let no one have any doubts on this matter. We 
may experience some ups and downs in the coming days, but we are 
determined to overcome this. The necessary measures have been 
adopted. We will experience certain difficulties for some time, 
but, as I said, let no one doubt that Turkey's future is open. 
Turkey is a great country. 
  I will explain the economic stability measures we adopted to 
the other countries and to financial circles. I will inform 
them that we are approaching this issue in a comprehensive 
manner and in all seriousness and determination. Our goal is to 
secure Turkey's reintegration with the world money markets and 
to ensure that everything proceeds according to its normal 
course. This will be achieved. [end recording] 
  Ciller took off for New York aboard a scheduled Turkish 
Airlines flight. She was seen off at Ataturk Airport by State 
Minister Necmettin Cevheri, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu, 
Istanbul Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and other officials. The 
prime minister will return to Turkey on 17 April.

  [Text] Ankara--The second term Joint Economic Commission 
meeting, led by Public Works and Housing Minister Onur 
Kumbaracibasi on the Turkish side and Foreign Economic Relations 
Minister Oleg Davydov on the Russian side ended with the signing 
of a protocol on Wednesday [6 April]. 
  The protocol proposes the development of cooperation in the 
areas of energy, transportation, communications and other areas. 
It further proposes establishing new areas for cooperation. 
Speaking at the signing ceremony of the protocol, Kumbaracibasi 
said that the two sides had discussed all the issues in a 
mutually benevolent atmosphere at the meeting. 
  Stressing that the relations between Turkey and Russia were 
improving, Kumbaracibasi said that both sides carried good 
intentions towards eliminating the problems and that more 
importantly, they had reached an agreement in principles on the 
issue of new and wider projects. 
  Davydov, who also spoke at the conference, said that the 
volume of commerce between the two countries would reach $2 
billion and noted that this meant that the volume of commerce 
between Turkey and Russia would equal that between Russia and 
the United States. He said, "Turkey will continue to be our 
most essential commercial partner." 
  The issue of the hardships that Turkey came face to face 
with 
at times when Russia cut off Ukraine's natural gas was also 
discussed at the meeting and the two sides agreed that the 
section of the Russian pipeline passing through Ukraine be 
bypassed, thus enabling the transportation of natural gas to 
Turkey. Although the issue of the threats which carrying oil 
through the straits posed for Istanbul was not openly discussed 
at the meeting, it was nevertheless noted that the two sides 
wholeheartedly supported the technical meetings on the prospect 
of finding alternatives for transporting the oil. Meanwhile, at 
a meeting he had with Kumbaracibasi on Wednesday morning, 
Russia's first deputy prime minister, Oleg Soskovets, noted that 
the issue of oil and gas was the most important area of 
cooperation between Turkey and Russia and suggested that the two 
sides cooperate on constructing an oil and gas pipeline between 
Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Officials 
reported that Russia was interested in the projects for building 
a nuclear plant in Turkey and building a dam on the Coruh river 
and that moreover it wanted to build a thermal power plant in 
Turkey. According to the protocol, the dam and thermal power 
plant be discussed only when Russia increases the amount of 
natural gas it gives to Turkey from the present amount of eight 
billion cubic meters to 10.5 billion cubic meters.

  [Text] Bulgarian Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, 
who arrived on an official visit to Ankara, has begun his 
contacts. On his arrival at the National Defense Ministry, 
Aleksandrov was received by National Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan with a military ceremony. In a statement at the meeting, 
Golhan said that Bulgaria's relations with Turkey have developed 
after that country's transition to democracy. Aleksandrov 
stressed that Bulgaria's relations with Turkey are developing in 
the field of defense industry. 
  Aleksandrov later called on Chief of Staff General Dogan 
Gures. At the meeting, Gures said that if the aggressors in the 
Balkans are not punished this will set an example and lead to 
graver results. Pointing out that the fighting in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is not between soldiers but that the Serbs 
are killing civilians, women and children, Gures expressed 
satisfaction over the NATO operation against the Serbs. 
Aleksandrov said that Bulgaria favors securing peace without 
resorting to arms in the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fertilizer Subsidy Was Increased </F>
17-80 percent"] 
  [Text] The coalition government, which did not want to 
raise the price of fertilizer prior to the elections, has 
implemented the second subsidy for fertilizer. After the 
increase on January 15, the amount of subsidy the producing 
companies received for nine different kinds of fertilizer was 
increased by 17-80 percent. After the rescission of the price 
hike for fertilizer in December the second subsidy increase was 
adopted for fertilizer producers so that the increase in foreign 
currency exchange would not be reflected in prices. 
  The subsidy increase, which was implemented so that farmers 
could buy affordable fertilizer, will be applied in the spring 
to the nine most commonly used kinds of fertilizer. The 
decision of the Council of Ministers regarding the subsidy 
increase, which is applied to nine different kinds of 
fertilizers, and the increase, which fluctuates from 17 to 80 
percent, was published in yesterday's RESMI GAZETE [OFFICIAL 
JOURNAL]. 
  According to the publication, the subsidies of the ammonia 
sulfate went from 475 to 855 lira and triple super phosphate 
went from 700 to 2000 lira. In addition to this, the subsidies 
of ammonium sulfate rose from 270 to 770 lira, ammonium nitrate 
from 620 to 1060 lira, urea from 500 to 950 lira, diammonium 
phosphate from 1250 to 2000 lira, "20.20.20" composition 
fertilizer from 1000 to 1350 lira, and the "15.15.15" 
composition fertilizer to 1390 lira.

<F P=106> [Report by Frances Williams and Guy de Jonquieres: "Everyone </F>
Wins in Uruguay Round"] 
  [Text] Marrakesh -- All countries will emerge winners from 
the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords, Mr Peter 
Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade declared yesterday. Mr Sutherland said assertions 
that some of the world's poorest countries would lose from the 
accords were based on "a misstatement of the facts." He was 
speaking on the eve of a four day meeting of ministers from more 
than 120 countries which will end with a formal Uruguay Round 
signing on Friday. 
  "The least developed countries are not losers but winners," 
he said. Above all, they would gain from strong multilateral 
rules and disputes settlement. For small and economically 
weaker countries, these rules were the only protection from the 
"law of the jungle" where "might is right." 
  Mr Sutherland said ratification of the Uruguay Round was 
still the subject of debate in some countries and legislative 
approval by the leading trading powers must be completed in time 
for the round to take effect by next January. However, the 
round would not mean an end to international trade policy 
disputes. 
  Japan is expected to call at this week's meeting for 
unilateral trade weapons to be placed on the agenda of the World 
Trade Organisation, planned to replace GATT. Tokyo fears that 
the new international trade rules will not curb the growing use 
of antidumping actions and U.S. threats of unilateral trade 
sanctions. 
  The GATT secretariat, in an analysis published this morning, 
estimates that market opening for agricultural and industrial 
goods negotiated in the Uruguay Round could add $235 billion 
(160.9 billion pounds) a year to world income by 2002. This 
compares with estimates from the World Bank, the OECD and others 
of $212-$274 billion. 
  These estimates do not include expected gains from 
liberalisation of services trade or the boost to business 
confidence and investment from improved trade rules. 
  According to GATT, industrial tariffs in developed countries 
will fall from an average 6.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Some 43 
per cent of their imports by value will enter duty free, against 
20 per cent before the round began. 
  Virtually all their industrial tariffs will be "bound," 
giving exporters security that they will not be raised again. 
Developing countries have agreed to bind tariff lines covering 
59 per cent of the value of their imports, compared with 14 per 
cent before the round began. 
  The GATT analysis notes that the least developed countries 
will receive significantly lower tariff cuts on their exports 
than others -- 25 per cent, compared with 37-38 per cent. 
  However, if textiles and clothing, and fish and fish 
products, are removed from the calculation tariff concessions to 
the poorest countries average 59 per cent compared with 44 per 
cent for industrialised nations. 
  In addition, abolition of quota restrictions under the 
Multi-Fibre Arrangement after 10 years could in effect more than 
double the 22 per cent average tariff reduction in the textiles 
and clothing sector, GATT points out.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE/RHR: "Rwandan Crisis: `Action of Belgian </F>
Paratroopers Initially Limited to Kigali'"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- Late Monday afternoon 
[11 April] Defense Ministry spokesman Colonel Van de Weghe 
stated that the 400 Belgian paratroops currently ready for 
action in Kigali will initially be limited to carrying out 
operations in the Rwandan capital before intervening elsewhere 
in the country. 
  At a press briefing in Brussels, he stated: "We do not 
currently envisage taking any action outside of Kigali. At the 
moment, it is not possible given the problems of mobility that 
we are running into in Kigali itself." 
  The head of the National Defense Information Service 
moreover 
said that the slowness with which Belgian Forces are acting is 
due to the coordination problems encountered: "It has taken a 
long time to coordinate the paratroops, the Belgian UN forces in 
the country, the Belgian Embassy, and French units." 
  Colonel Van de Weghe further indicated that some French 
units 
are to remain in Rwanda until all Belgian nationals have been 
evacuated. One contingent, nonetheless, will be withdrawn, 
France having already evacuated all of its nationals (some 600 
people). 
  "An uneasy calm settled on Kigali on Monday afternoon," he 
said. Only a little sporadic gunfire could be heard, but "we are 
unable to say who is firing on who," Colonel Van de Weghe added. 
  The Rwandan capital's airport is "safe at the moment," and 
aircraft "are landing and taking off normally." 
  Colonel Van de Weghe said that in Gisenyi (in the northwest 
of the country, near the border with Zaire), the situation 
"seems to have calmed after initial problems." He denied 
reports that the seven Belgian military volunteers had been 
surrounded. 
  "The commander has confirmed to us that the military 
volunteers are moving around normally and are helping to 
assemble civilians for transfer to Goma (BELGA editor's note: 
The closest Zaire border town)," he stressed. In the colonel's 
opinion, some 20 Belgians are still in Gisenyi awaiting transfer 
to Goma. 
  The other Belgian nationals outside Kigali are assembled in 
Ruhengeri (in the northwest) and Butare (in the south).

  [Text] Geneva, April 12 (AFP) -- The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been authorised to take 
aid to some 267,000 Burundian refugees in camps in southern 
Rwanda, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Foa also said that close to 10,000 other people, fleeing the 
violence in Rwanda, were seeking refuge in the region. 
  Some 8,100 refugees had just arrived in Zaire, Foa said, 
adding that the information was still incomplete. Among these, 
she said, there were 5,000 Burundians who feared an explosion of 
violence in their country, 2,000 Rwandans and 1,100 Burundian 
refugees from Rwanda. 
  Foa said the UNHCR had not seen the kind of exodus from 
Rwanda it feared might occur, perhaps because people were afraid 
to move. 
  The Burundian prime minister had given the UNHCR permission 
to cross the border between Burundi and Rwanda to take supplies 
to the Burundian refugees, Foa added.

  [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr (CNA)--The head of the Turkish 
parliamentary delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of 
the Council of Europe (COE), Kemal Mimaroglu of the True Path 
Party, told CNA that he envisages the current structure of 
Cyprus being maintained as part of a Cyprus solution. 
  In an exclusive interview with CNA, he said "We must keep 
the 
actual structures of the Turkish and Greek sides." 
  He advocated "equal rights and equal representation 
according 
to the population." 
  To a remark by CNA that the 18 percent of the population of 
Cyprus cannot have the 50 percent representation, Mimaroglu said 
he could not give any figures. 
  Asked if he would recommend to the Turkish Cypriots to 
return 
to their seats in the legal House of Representatives, the 
Turkish MP said "As it is now the actual structure of northern 
and southern Cyprus cannot be made into one. It is not possible 
to make it to one." 
  Advocating the making of a state in Cyprus for the two 
communities, he said it had to maintain "completely the actual 
structures of both sides." 
  He recommended negotiations under U.N. auspices and remarked 
"We would like to see the two sides to have equal rights without 
any discussion." 
  Mimaroglu made these statements to CNA after a press 
conference he organised for a four-member delegation of 
so-called Turkish Cypriot MP's. 
  At the press conference, the "MP's" set out their views and 
claimed President Kliridhis had shifted from the original text 
of the U.N. package of CBM's. 
  The "speaker" of "Turkish Cypriot Assembly" Ajarkan charged 
that the U.N. had amended their original proposals to appease 
President Kliridhis' demands. 
  Asked by CNA whether the Turkish Cypriot side was at odds 
with the U.N., Ajarkan repeated the view that Denktas had 
accepted in principle the CBM's but these were altered and 
accused the U.N. for making repeated errors since 1964.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Allied leaders have thrown down the gauntlet to 
Bosnian Serb forces besieging the Muslim enclave of Gorazde with 
a warning to pull back or face more air strikes. 
  Unsubstantiated radio reports from United Nations officials 
in Gorazde described continued shelling of the town despite a 
second air strike against Serb positions. The Bosnian Serbs 
have said they will consider themselves at war with the UN if 
air strikes go on. 
  Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg issued a stern warning 
to the Serbs: "They need to keep in mind that force will be used 
to support UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units in the way that 
has just happened in Gorazde." 
  And NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner strongly advised 
the Serbs not to retaliate as such a move would provoke a tough 
response. 
  "We would not sit there," he said. "We have so far used only 
two aircraft. There are far more than 100 aircraft down there, 
so I would warn anybody against the idea of retaliation." 
  Government sources in London made plain that Serb forces 
should be under no illusion that there is a reluctance to use 
air power. 
  "If shelling continues and UNPROFOR feels threatened, then 
the same is likely to happen again," said one official. "The 
writing is on the wall -- the message is there and we can see it 
being hammered home until they finally get the message." 
  But Britain's support for strikes against the Serbs is 
believed to have been behind an abortive attempt by 
ultra-nationalist Greek terrorists to hit the carrier Ark Royal 
with antitank rockets. The November 17 guerrilla group said it 
had tried to hit the 20,000-ton carrier with two 88mm rockets as 
it was docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens. 
  A Whitehall source said: "This group of terrorists is 
ultranationalist and, as such, support the Serbs. The 
connection is not too difficult to make." 
  Ark Royal with its six Sea Harrier jump-jets and its sister 
ship Invincible have been alternating on six-month tours since 
January last year as part of NATO's operations to enforce the 
no-fly zone over Bosnia. It is now steaming back into the 
Adriatic from Greece. It was unlikely that RAF [Royal Air 
Force] or Royal Navy warplanes would be used in strikes at 
present, British sources said last night. 
  For the second day running an elite seven-strong squad of 
SAS 
[Special Air Service] soldiers in Gorazde played a key role in 
the attack on Serb positions. 
  Acting as forward air controllers, they successfully 
directed 
an American F/A-18 bomber on to its targets of Serb armoured 
vehicles. 
  Several patrol groups from the Hereford-based regiment were 
ordered into a number of Muslim enclaves following a specific 
request from UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, 
himself a former SAS commander. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Simon Shadbolt, military assistant to 
General Rose, gave an update on the situation on the ground in 
Bosnia overnight. 
  He said: "There has been no shelling of Gorazde town. There 
has been some sporadic fighting in the hills to the north and to 
the east, which we are investigating, but of the town itself and 
of the UN personnel and troops in the area -- they have not been 
engaged and the area is described as calm." 
  Replying to Bosnian Serb criticisms that General Rose had 
treated Bosnia like a British colony he said: "This is a highly 
complex operation and over the last few days General Rose has 
made a series of very fine judgments over which way to go. 
  ``But he has maintained two clear tracks. One track is his 
obligation to the safe area and the safety of the troops, and 
that is in Gorazde. His other track is maintaining the 
ceasefire process and the cessation of hostilities throughout 
Bosnia.'' 
  Lt Col Shadbolt told BBC Radio 4 that UN commanders would be 
drawing up a plan for Gorazde and considering further aid and a 
helicopter evacuation of the seriously injured.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The IRA 
Is Invincible"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Adams, were you informed in 
advance about the IRA attacks on London's Heathrow Airport? 
  [Adams] No, never. Where did you get that idea from? 
  [Correspondent] Are you acquainted with the persons who 
carried out this terrorist action? 
  [Adams] No. You forget that the Sinn Fein is separate from 
the IRA. 
  [Correspondent] If you are not acquainted with IRA leaders, 
how can you make the IRA stop its armed operations? 
  [Adams] One does not have to know the IRA activists 
personally in order to move things along. My wish is to 
demilitarize the Anglo-Irish conflict. Two armed groups are 
facing each other in this conflict, the British Army and the 
militant pro-British groups from Northern Ireland on the one 
hand, and the relatively smaller IRA on the other. They must 
all lay down their arms at the same time. 
  [Correspondent] You are the Irish politician with the 
greatest influence on the IRA leadership because of your origins 
as a Catholic-Republican resistance fighter. You cannot say you 
have no connection with the IRA leadership. 
  [Adams] I have never dissociated myself from the IRA. That 
would be a dishonorable thing to do. But while I am politically 
active, the IRA is an armed, secret organization. I would like 
it to stop its actions. 
  [Correspondent] Do you see any chance of that? 
  [Adams] The IRA is not going to stop unilaterally. In order 
to speed the peace process along, I would like the British 
Government to commence talks with our Sinn Fein. Then I could 
go to the IRA and, hopefully, offer it a packet of solutions 
that would permit it to reach a final decision on future policy. 
The British Army has been trying to beat the IRA for 25 years. 
But the IRA has not been beatable. On the contrary, it looks 
as if the IRA could continue its armed actions forever. 
  [Correspondent] In other words, war to the very last? 
  [Adams] No. For Ireland, there is no military solution. We 
have a political problem here, and it needs a political 
solution. I have been trying to break the military stalemate 
for years. Several times the IRA has publicly said that the 
initiative coming from me and from John Hume, leader of the 
Social Democratic party in Northern Ireland, could provide the 
basis for peace. Hume and I suggested a roundtable of all 
parties involved. 
  [Correspondent] Your credibility as a man of peace collapsed 
when you were one of the pall-bearers of the coffin of the IRA 
terrorist Thomas Begley, who killed nine persons in a bomb 
attack in Belfast's Shankill Road. Does this gesture not have 
the effect of a nod of approval to violence? 
  [Adams] What is violence? There is institutionalized 
violence, the violence of the state. I was a victim of this 
violence when the British Army locked me up for five years. 
  [Correspondent] Let us not get philosophical. What do you 
say to the murder of innocent civilians? 
  [Adams] I am against that, of course. What happened in 
Shankill Road was unforgivable and wrong. 
  [Correspondent] Then why do you help carry Begley's coffin? 
  [Adams] The man was dead. Why should I not carry his coffin 
at his funeral? I am not going to leave Thomas Begley's family 
alone in their grief. I would feel the same way about any 
family that loses a 19 year old son. We cannot make teenagers 
responsible for this conflict -- neither British soldiers, nor 
young Protestants, nor IRA volunteers. 
  [Correspondent] After 25 years of bloodshed and 3,400 
deaths, you said during your recent U.S. visit that "this 
generation is going to see peace in Ireland." What makes you so 
sure? 
  [Adams] The world climate of solving conflicts. If I had 
said five years ago that Nelson Mandela would be released from 
prison and become South Africa's president-designate, everyone 
would have thought I was joking. The conflict seemed insoluble. 
  [Correspondent] Just like the conflict in Northern Ireland. 
  [Adams] I hope the progress in Africa also provides a signal 
for people here in Ireland. The turnabout in South Africa 
occurred because Mandela's enemy, the government of Pretoria, 
was prepared to swallow the bitter pill and make concessions 
that set the process in motion. The government in London should 
learn something from that. 
  [Correspondent] Nonetheless, the London government has 
already taken a big step and held secret talks with the IRA and 
Sinn Fein. Do you think Prime Minister Major is determined to 
find a political solution for Northern Ireland? 
  [Adams] British public opinion would surely approve the 
taking of risks in order to achieve peace in Ireland, but 
unfortunately Major is too much a victim of the obsessions of 
his party's right wing, as well as being a victim of the 
Unionists, the Northern Irish party that wants Northern Ireland 
to belong to Great Britain at all costs. Major's weakness is an 
obstacle to a peaceful solution. That is why we must seek other 
ways of attaining our goal. 
  [Correspondent] London treats you like a persona non grata. 
You cannot travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, and you 
cannot be heard or seen on radio or television. 
  [Adams] That is just one example of the British Government's 
stupidity. 
  [Correspondent] You and your family survive all attacks. 
Once you were hit by five bullets when you entered a Belfast 
restaurant. Do you feel in greater danger now that you are 
involved in the peace process? 
  [Adams] I feel no hatred toward the people who tried to 
shoot 
me, nor toward those who might be planning to do so now. That 
is the way things are here. Men act this way because they see 
me as a danger to their interests. There is only one way: The 
armed wings of the radical pro-British groups must be involved 
in the peace process just like the IRA. 
  [Correspondent] Are you really prepared to sit down at the 
negotiating table with your archenemies the Protestants? 
  [Adams] This has nothing to do with religion. My enemies 
are not the Protestants. We are talking about political groups, 
and they must all take part in the talks. There must be 
dialogue without preconditions. Certain people have been 
excluded for too long, and that is why no progress has been made. 
  [Correspondent] With your readiness for compromise, you will 
also turn IRA hardliners into your opponents. For them, your 
policy means treason. Do you not think that the next bullet 
fired at you might come from an IRA weapon? 
  [Adams] No. The IRA would have to join the back of the line 
of my potential assassins.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by Ruediger </F>
Moniac; place and date not given: "Ruehe -- NATO Air Strikes in 
Bosnia Absolutely Necessary"] 
  [Text] [Moniac] NATO aircraft crush Serb-Bosnian tank 
attacks on the center of Gorazde. Was this an appropriate 
reaction, Mr. Ruehe? 
  [Ruehe] A human catastrophe on an immense scale is beginning 
to emerge in Gorazde, as the city is in danger of falling into 
the hands of the Serbs. The strike by NATO aircraft on behalf 
of the United Nations was, therefore, absolutely necessary. At 
the moment, the Serbs seem to be containing themselves, they are 
not advancing any further. Obviously, the Serbs only understand 
this clear language. Now everybody has to influence the Serbs 
to stop their attacks. Russia can continue to play an important 
role in this process. 
  [Moniac] Should the Serbs not have been stripped of the arms 
that are now pointed at the Muslim enclave back in Sarajevo, 
instead of only making them withdraw? 
  [Ruehe] The United Nations' military ground forces are very 
limited and depend on the warring parties keeping the various 
agreements. So far, the United Nations have had neither legal 
nor practical opportunities to actively disarm the besiegers. 
It is, therefore, all the more important now to exploit all the 
opportunities in Bosnia where the United Nations can fall back 
on NATO's resources. This means military air operations in 
particular. Neither the civilian population nor UN troops must 
come to harm in these missions. 
  [Moniac] Do German politicians have to restrain themselves 
forever -- due to Germany's historical involvement in the 
Balkans? Can it go on like this, although there does not seem to 
be an end of the terrors of war in sight? 
  [Ruehe] German soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be part 
of the problem rather than part of the solution, because their 
commitment and their work would not be supported by all the 
parties to the conflict. For this reason, we are not 
considering a deployment of German soldiers there. 
  [Moniac] What contribution could Germany make, if a peace 
plan were to come into force in former Yugoslavia? 
  [Ruehe] We should not speculate about a situation now that 
must be established first and toward whose realization we are 
all working.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Field by Field"] </F>
  [Text] The combat plane missions of NATO in UN service 
draw the line of change in Western policy toward armed mediation 
between the parties to the Bosnian war one field further. The 
field is still not occupied, even on the battlefield of the six 
declared "UN protected areas." However, the situation of the 
war has been changed in its quality by the second military 
initiative of the alliance after the Sarajevo ultimatum: Even 
the air strikes of Gorazde, which are most narrowly limited in 
purpose, goals, and means, are a leap ahead by the allies across 
the hurdle that has been in place for two years. 
  It is possible that this second leap will again be too short 
in the end, but the air strikes can be continued and expanded to 
other situations. A step-by-step expansion of military 
interventions, as President Clinton suggested, can reduce the 
fan of Serbian opposition and shift the operational risks, 
including the psychological pressure of military action, which 
is linked with that, to the Serbian troops. This is the only 
way to break the dynamism of the Serbian attacks and to 
stabilize the situation by military means. This is the 
precondition for a solid basis for negotiations. Even though 
military force cannot solve political problems if the enemy is 
not defeated and the country is not occupied, but it can force a 
peace by negotiations, at least for a durable cease-fire. 
  Whether this effect will come about depends primarily on the 
persistence and the effect of the NATO air raids. The military 
criterion of the effect in fighting against heavy weapons and 
preventing major attacks is also the political criterion of 
readiness for an appropriate, limited, if necessary also 
continued air war against selected military targets. 
  Thus, the three problems that the allies have tried to evade 
for two years are now confronting NATO head on under more 
difficult conditions and pressure of time: The problem of 
intervention, the problem of escalation, and the problem of 
acceptance in case of protracted fighting by allied forces 
beyond their own alliance area. In this respect, the political 
quality of NATO will continue to change toward an active 
security alliance for crisis management and ending conflicts 
beyond its borders. 
  In Bosnia, the shock of the first attacks from the air is 
affecting the Serbs in NATO's favor and in particular also 
Belgrade, where one is in reality not counting on an "escalation 
of war," because it might undermine Serbian rule over Kosovo and 
Vojvodina, destroy the cohesion with Montenegro, bring NATO 
combat troops to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, FYROM] and even to Albania -- which has offered its 
ports and airports to NATO -- just as to Bosnia itself and might 
thus annul the conquests of territory that the Serbs have made 
so far. Military escalation is the last thing that Serbia could 
bear. For the nationalist communist Milosevic regime in 
Belgrade, this risk is linked with the imminent risk of 
survival. In particular, therefore, Belgrade has tried from the 
very beginning to use Russia as a power to limit the conflict 
for Serbia's security within the borders of the territories 
conquered since 1991. 
  Above all, Russian influence is to protect the endangered 
unity of Serbia and Montenegro as the Yugoslav rump state and 
the expansion of the borders as much as possible. This has been 
recognized in time by Moscow, while the Western governments seem 
to have taken the alleged threat of escalation seriously, while 
the government and the army command in Pale and in Belgrade have 
always shied way for good reason from any military confrontation 
with NATO and its main power, the United States. 
  It was the capital political and strategic mistake of the 
Western allies to avoid this experiment with the Serb's 
political steadfastness. This renunciation of action was also 
of great disadvantage for a pragmatic realpolitik, which was 
proved again during the latest NATO air raid: What one could 
have achieved alone two years ago now depends on Moscow. 
Approval for the mission had to be gained by diplomatic means 
from Russia, and an extension of the UN mandate for the 
effective protection of the "refuges" is not in sight for the 
time being because of Russia's resistance. 
  NATO and the United States on their own will neither be able 
to determine the situation in the Balkans nor to control the 
mediation of a compromise. They will have to share their 
influence with Russia, with all the consequences resulting for 
the treatment of Serbia and Bosnia. A privileged "partnership" 
with NATO, as Yeltsin demands it for the military big power 
Russia, need not be further considered or criticized in Brussels 
-- it is developing on its own from NATO's two-year absence and 
from the resulting situation in the Balkans. NATO needs a 
strategy of crisis management that is oriented toward action, if 
it wants to preserve its interests together with and toward 
Russia and to remain effective as an alliance.

  [Text] In Paris this afternoon, Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe gave an explanation to deputies about the situation in 
Bosnia. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] First, of course, we have to put an 
end to the Serb offensive against Gorazde, without delay and 
without conditions. This resolution must not waver. Of course, 
France, which is part of the air support contingent, will face 
up to all its responsibilities as far as this is concerned. 
  But equally, in order to prevent a potentially never-ending 
escalation, we have to set precise political aims for our action 
in Gorazde, starting with an immediate cease-fire, and, second, 
the deployment of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] on the 
ground to act as a buffer between the communities. We are 
contemplating the possibility of a Security Council resolution 
to this end. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva will depart tomorrow 
for China. According to an interview by the prime minister to 
NCNA [New China News Agency], this country is one of the 
priorities of Portuguese foreign policy. The prime minister's 
second visit to that country has many aims, but economic and 
trade cooperation is no doubt the great Portuguese interest. 
Evidence of this is the large party taken by the prime 
minister, particularly a group of 60 businessmen. Maria 
Pimentel will comment on Cavaco Silva's interview: 
  [Pimentel] We have found out that relations with China is 
one 
of the greatest priorities of Portuguese foreign policy. 
Evidence of this statement by Cavaco Silva to NCNA is the 
delegation the Portuguese prime minister is taking with him on 
his second official visit to that country. 
  There are over 60 businessmen alone, representing the most 
varied sectors. The aim is to take advantage of the open policy 
of the Chinese to foreign investment. [passage omitted] 
  Let us remind you that the balance of payments between China 
and Portugal is clearly unfavorable to Lisbon. Portugal 
imported over 29.5 billion escudos worth of Chinese products and 
the total of Portuguese exports was a little over five billion 
escudos. 
  Cavaco Silva's visit to China -- the most 
economics-orientated ever -- also aims to mark the seventh 
anniversary of the joint Luso- Chinese Declaration on Macao, 
which defined the transition rules of that territory to Chinese 
administration within five years. Among the issues relating to 
Macao's future which Cavaco Silva may debate with the Chinese 
authorities, is the nationality of the Portuguese from Macao, 
which is being considered by sources linked to the process as 
the point of greatest friction at present between Portugal and 
China. 
  [Announcer] Cavaco Silva will depart tomorrow morning for 
China. He will be in the east for two weeks: seven days in 
China and then Macao.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Condemnation of Speech by Arzalluz, </F>
Who Is Accused of Isolating Basque Country"] 
  [Excerpt] Bilbao -- Several political leaders yesterday 
harshly criticized the remarks of PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz, who referred on Aberri Eguna [Basque 
fatherland day] to those who "talk a great deal about ETA 
[Basque Homeland and Liberty], when they have headings and 
articles in their Constitution, designed for Reds and 
separatists, in which they entrust their fatherland's unity to 
the Army, weapons, and violence." The leaders of the nationwide 
parties in the Basque Country accused Arzalluz of isolating the 
Basque Country through his radicalism, which, in the opinion of 
both the PSE [Basque Socialist Party] and the People's Party of 
the Basque Country, stems from the proximity of the Basque 
autonomous community elections. 
  The harshest criticisms yesterday came from the Basque 
Socialists, of whom Aznar said a few days ago that they are not 
Basques. Nicolas Redondo Terreros, secretary general of the PSE 
of Vizcaya, said that Arzalluz' remarks are "intolerable" and 
show "separatism," although he specified that the problem is not 
between the Basque Country and the rest of Spain "but among the 
Basques themselves, because there are many of us Basques who do 
not share Mr. Arzalluz' idea of the Basque Country and Spain at 
all." 
  PSE Deputy Secretary General Jose Luis Marcos Merino also 
criticized the remarks by Arzalluz, whom he called a "crank," 
and said that his remarks are "nonsense" and have no 
justification, because "to compare ETA with the Army and Article 
8 of the Constitution is an act of total cynicism and a lie." 
Marcos Merino added that "so many foolish remarks and in such 
close succession are inexplicable, unless the PNV leaders are 
suffering from delirium and hallucinations." 
  In Marcos Merino's opinion, Arzalluz' statements do not help 
the Basque Country to surmount the economic crisis which it is 
suffering, "but isolate us increasingly." 
  Jaime Mayor Oreja, chairman of the People's Party in the 
Basque Country, spoke in similar terms, accusing the PNV 
chairman of isolating the Basque Country through statements such 
as these, "which are the best demonstration of a political 
fiction which has been so damaging and counterproductive for the 
Basque Country." In Mayor Oreja's opinion, "those statements do 
not further the quest to resolve the Basque Country's real 
problems, and are a political fiction." 
<H5>  Regain Prominence </H5>
  In the opinion of the People's Party of the Basque Country, 
what the PNV leaders are seeking through statements such as 
their chairman's is to "regain prominence and increase the 
political justification of the nationalist parties and, more 
specifically, of the PNV," in view of the elections' proximity. 
In Mayor Oreja's opinion, what Arzalluz is attempting to this 
end is to "divide deeply the Basque people" and "cause a scandal 
and reaction throughout Spain through radicalism," although he 
said that the questioning of the Army's role in the defense of 
Spain's unity did not surprise them. 
  On relations between the People's Party and the PNV 
following 
the meeting with Arzalluz, he said that "meeting points must 
always be explored within the substantial and very considerable 
differences," and added that "there is no possibility of 
agreement" on these matters. [passage omitted]

  The letter notes that President Glavkos Kliridhis accepted 
the 21 March document on implementing the CBM's on condition 
that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas do the same, although 
he did raise a series of protests.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that 
following the NATO intervention against Serb positions 
yesterday, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is relatively 
calm. He said that efforts are under way to secure a cease-fire 
between the sides. 
  Addressing the Turkish Grand National Assembly session 
chaired by Mustafa Kalemli, Cetin commented on the Serb attacks 
against Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Explaining that he 
conducted a telephone conversation with the prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina this afternoon, Cetin said that it was once 
again confirmed that chemical weapons were not used in Gorazde. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] Following the two NATO operations 
last night, the situation is calm in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
Bosnian prime minister [Alija Izetbegovic] said that there are 
no incidents at the moment. There is no question of mass deaths. 
He is the prime minister of the country; I must believe him, 
and so must we all. No mass killing or chemical weapons were 
used. 
  Now, various countries are engaged in efforts to secure a 
cease-fire. He cited his conditions for a cease-fire in Gorazde 
because we are also conducting contacts on this matter. For a 
cease-fire, the Serbs must withdraw to their positions of 29 
March. In other words, the Serbian units and militias must 
withdraw to the positions they were occupying on 29 March. He 
asked us to continue our contacts on this matter. He expressed 
the Bosnians' readiness for peace but the Serbs must definitely 
withdraw to their positions of 29 March. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister stated that the initiatives on this 
issue will continue. Pointing out that the events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be recorded as a black mark in history, 
Cetin remarked, however, that it is not right to use this as a 
tool for internal politics. A response must be given to each 
Serbian move, Cetin stressed, adding that the Serbs understand 
only force. 
  Cetin said that certain private television stations in 
Turkey 
reported the use of chemical weapons and mass massacres in the 
region when the Serbian attacks against Gorazde began on 
Saturday [9 April]. He added that his contacts proved this to be 
untrue. Such a broadcasting concept does not exist in any part 
of the world, Cetin underlined. Cetin stressed that the 
demonstrations initiated following the Gorazde incidents could 
undermine Turkey's democracy and its image abroad and especially 
political parties should categorically avoid this. 
  After Cetin's speech. political party groups expressed their 
views on the subject. Motherland Party Bitlis Deputy Kamran 
Inan said that the Serbs are acting with the aim of annihilating 
the Turkish culture in the Balkans. Inan remarked that the 
operations conducted by NATO air forces in the past two days are 
mere acts of show. 
  [Begin Inan recording] The aim here is the creation of a 
great Serbia, which is the policy of Britain. Lord Owen is 
being used to this end. They wish to curb German influence in 
the north and Turkish influence in the southern Balkans by 
establishing the greater Serbia-Greece front. It is necessary 
to understand what is going on. Greece is currently engaged in 
preparations to block Turkey's way and possibly create a war in 
the Balkans. Therefore, the situation should not be viewed in 
its narrow framework. It is good to conduct contacts, but the 
important thing is to achieve results. [end recording]

  [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation (NATO) is ready to launch new air strikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina if United Nations forces are endangered in 
attacks there, a NATO spokesman said here Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Speaking after a meeting of ambassadors from NATO countries, 
he said they had expressed "general satisfaction" at two attacks 
by U.S. warplanes on Serb positions around the Bosnian Moslem 
enclave of Gorazde on Sunday and Monday. 
  "General satisfaction was expressed at the two missions 
conducted under the authority of Resolution 836 of the UN 
Security Council according to permanent procedures fixed with 
the UN Protection Force in Bosnia last year," he said. 
  Resolution 836 provides for the protection of "safe areas," 
including Sarajevo, Gorazde and four more towns, which have 
predominantly Moslem populations. 
  "NATO remains ready to provide close air support in case of 
new attacks against UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) in the 
accomplishment of its global mandate," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Vienna, April 13 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korea to accept inspections 
on a key atomic site that Pyongyang barred the Agency from 
checking last month, an Agency spokesman said Wednesday [13 
April]. 
  The Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog, however, has not 
received any response from the country so far, the spokesman 
said. 
  Besides additional inspections on the radiochemical 
laboratory in the Yongbyong nuclear complex, north of the 
capital, the IAEA has also demanded North Korea allow the Agency 
to change film and batteries of surveillance cameras installed 
at nuclear facilities there, the spokesman said. 
  Last month, a six-member IAEA team conducted inspections on 
North Korea's seven-declared nuclear sites to check that no 
radioactive material had been diverted from the plants for 
military purposes. 
  But Pyongyang refused the team access to the laboratory, 
thus 
prompting the Agency to refer the issue to the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  The Council issued a nonbinding presidential statement March 
31 urging North Korea to grant full inspections on its nuclear 
facilities. 
  The communist country has denied it is developing a nuclear 
arsenal and warned that a war could break out on the Korean 
peninsula if it was pressed too hard on the matter.

  [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
presented a controversial proposal here Wednesday [13 April] for 
mandatory consultations between multinational companies and 
their employees within the EU. 
  The proposal follows the failure of EU employer and trade 
union organisations to reach a voluntary accord on how to 
improve ways by which employees are informed and consulted about 
a multinational's activities. 
  The European Commission said its proposed framework would be 
mandatory for companies which cannot negotiate a voluntary 
accord with their employees within two years, or which refuse 
pointblank within six months to start negotiations. 
  It would apply to companies with at least 1,000 employees, 
including at least 100 each in at least two member states -- if 
at least 100 employees in at least two countries ask for it in 
writing. 
  EU Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn said the 
proposal, which must still be approved by member states, aimed 
at maximum flexibility. 
  He said: "It is designed to trigger off a process of 
negotiation between the social partners at company level which 
are best suited to their own particular circumstances. 
  ``It is only in the event of failure to agree that minimum 
requirements concerning the nature and content of information 
and consultation will apply,'' Flynn added. 
  But the EU employers' confederation attacked the proposal, 
saying that the Commission wanted to impose a "uniform, rigid 
and bureaucratic" structure on all EU companies. 
  The directive, which stems from the social chapter of the 
EU's Maastricht union treaty, would apply to all companies, 
whether based within the EU or outside, whose European 
operations meet the Commission's size criteria. 
  The only exception is Britain, which negotiated an exemption 
from the social chapter when the treaty was negotiated. But the 
proposal would apply to affiliates of British-based companies in 
other EU countries.

<F P=106> [Article signed FR: "Van Miert Tired of Paying Lip Service </F>
to European Union -- European Labor Unions Criticize 
`Non-Debate' on Employment"] 
  [Excerpts] More and more often, Europe is divided by 
discussions, which seem theological at times, between employers 
and employees about the question whether employment or public 
debt must be the priority issue to be dealt with, and between 
the European Commission and national governments. "The European 
Union (EU) cannot function as a Union unless there is a 
willingness to cooperate on the part of the member states," 
European Commissioner Van Miert (Flemish-Speaking Socialist 
Party) stated yesterday. 
  These sterile debates form a fundamental impediment to the 
employment conference of the European socialists, which started 
in Brussels yesterday. The conference is presided by former 
Swedish Finance Minister Allan Lansson, and is attended by 
delegations from labor unions, employers and politicians of the 
twelve EU member states and of the four applicant member states. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  White Paper </H5>
  Karel Van Miert came up with another reason why Europe is so 
powerless, while there is an increasing need for action now that 
the army of unemployed has grown to 20 million. Yesterday, on 
behalf of Jacques Delors he was supposed to come and explain how 
the implementation of the latter's white paper was proceeding. 
Instead, his speech soon turned into a complaint about the 
reasons why we are not much further with the white paper and 
with many other European initiatives. "The European Commission 
has its hands tied," he argued. "Ninety percent of the white 
paper is connected with national and even regional powers. Who 
is responsible for its implementation?" Van Miert wondered. 
  Van Miert believes that Europe has insufficient means to 
fight unemployment on a European scale. He does consider the 
Maastricht Treaty to be a step in the right direction, but 
regrets the lack of willingness on the part of the member states 
to actually cooperate. According to Van Miert, this paralysis 
also explains why so much potential still remains undeveloped 
within the unified market. He was mainly referring to 
telecommunication networks and the transportation 
infrastructure, but also to post offices and to the energy 
sector. Companies such as the national railways do have the 
technical means, but lack the financial capacity to cooperate 
within Europe. That is why Van Miert also calls for more 
support to companies which are taking chances for European 
integration. According to Van Miert, this inadequate support is 
due to a lack of ambition for "ideological and political 
reasons." He says that both employers and unions are being 
obstructive because they are primarily concerned about national 
interests.

  [Text] Luxembourg, April 12 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
fisheries ministers agreed here Tuesday [12 April] to apply 
stricter controls on fish imports, mainly from Russian, 
Ukrainian and Polish ships, in a bid to combat a glut of cheap 
foreign fish. 
  A majority of countries overruled objections from Britain, 
Denmark and the Netherlands that tighter controls were 
protectionist and unnecessary. 
  The new regulations, due to come into effect on May 15, 
provide that the fish from foreign boats can be off-loaded only 
at designated ports where they can be subjected to EU health and 
veterinary controls. 
  The imported fish will also have to be sold at prices which 
do not under-cut minimum levels set each year by the EU or by 
producer organisations at the port of entry. The new rules do 
not apply to fish imports for processing plants.

  [Text] Luxembourg, April 12 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
fisheries ministers agreed here Tuesday [12 April] to impose 
tighter controls on cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland 
coast of Canada, an EU spokesman said. 
  Under the accord, which follows a transatlantic agreement 
reached in February, direct cod fishing will be suspended in the 
region, known as 3 N-O, until the end of the year. 
  The accord confirms the ceiling set by the earlier agreement 
of 6,000 tonnes for by-catches in the region. 
  Under the by-catches arrangement, vessels fishing for other 
species are allowed a limit of 5 percent cod in their catch, up 
to the 6,000-tonne ceiling. 
  Canada had been asking for a total ban on cod fishing in the 
region, arguing that continued exploitation was threatening to 
wipe out stocks of the species there completely. 
  Earlier in the day the EU fisheries ministers agreed to 
apply 
stricter controls on fish imports, mainly from Russian, 
Ukrainian and Polish ships, in a bid to combat a glut of cheap 
foreign fish.

  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- The French Foreign 
Ministry said Tuesday [12 April] it has warned Russian 
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to keep in check 
his outrageous behaviour and comments during the rest of his 
stay in France. 
  Zhirinovskiy, who is part of a Russian delegation attending 
the Council of Europe's spring parliamentary session in 
Strasbourg, has outdone himself since his arrival in France by 
gatecrashing one Council meeting Monday and ripping plants and 
throwing them at protesters outside the Russian consulate in 
Strasbourg. 
  He also denounced NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs, 
suggesting Russia should bomb European cities. 
  "His statements are unacceptable and Mr. Zhirinovskiy was 
once again warned to refrain from making such statements," 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said here Tuesday. 
  He said Zhirinovskiy was reminded that French law concerning 
visitors to France was applicable in his case and that his 
activities should be linked to his stated purpose for coming 
here, that is to attend the Council of Europe session. 
  He said Zhirinovskiy's visa application to France was 
approved only so that he could attend the parliamentary session 
in Strasbourg. 
  Zhirinovskiy is part of the 18-strong Russian delegation 
attending the Parliamentary Assembly. Russia has had "special 
guest" status since 1992.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene by anchorman </F>
Jan Becaus in the studio -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Becaus] Mr. Dehaene, the city 
of Kigali has been almost entirely taken [by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front, RPF]. Rwanda is about to have a completely new 
regime, that of the rebels. What will your government's 
attitude be toward this new regime? 
  [Dehaene] I do not believe that we can anticipate how the 
situation will shape up. I believe that, in a country such as 
Rwanda with two tribes, only a negotiated settlement will offer 
a long-term solution. I believe, however, that it is still too 
early to comment on this. We have to continue our efforts, 
together with the United Nations, to find a negotiated 
settlement, just like we did for the Arusha agreement. 
  [Becaus] Professor Doom of Ghent University has reproached 
the government for not not having an Africa policy, that it is 
acting like a fire brigade in Africa. What is your reaction to 
this? 
  [Dehaene] I have much respect for professors who give advice 
after the fact. I believe that today, as a result of the 
president's killing, we are facing a new situation which we 
could not have anticipated. We indeed are facing a new 
situation, and, as we told the parliamentary commission earlier 
this week, together with Parliament we will have to define a new 
policy, or at least adapt our policy to the new situation. This 
applies both to our African policy in general and to the way in 
which we will organize our African development aid. Given the 
current sensitivity and emotions, we have to avoid making rash 
decisions which will have a long-term consequences. I believe 
that, in the long term, we will have to continue our aid to and 
development work in Rwanda and in Africa, although today we can 
provide only humanitarian aid. But we will have to examine this 
more carefully once we understand the new situation in Rwanda, 
and then make decsions based on a long-term perspective.

<F P=106> [Interview with Erik Derycke, state secretary for </F>
development cooperation, by Jean-Pierre Stroobantson on 12 
April; place not given: "On the Future of Cooperation With 
Rwanda"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Stroobants] Does our 
cooperation with Rwanda have any future? 
  [Derycke] During the parliamentary debate, it was only the 
Flemish Bloc which shocked me, arguing for the abandoning of an 
Africa which they see as on the road to ruin. If that is the 
position of Belgian society, as the Flemish Bloc claims, then I 
am almost ashamed to be Belgian. Europe has a tradition which 
will not allow it to act in this way. I have also been 
surprised by the extent to which certain deputies, and no doubt 
public opinion, are ill-informed on the subject of Rwanda, 
unaware that we have redirected 80 percent of our aid for this 
country to basic activities, far removed from political 
intrigues. 
  [Stroobants] Specifically? 
  [Derycke] In the field of education, health care, and 
agriculture we have given the minimum necessary for these people 
who, without us, would have nothing. In the future, we will 
have to discuss cooperation within the government, with the 
Parliament, and with the people. Like everyone else, I too am 
pained by the death of our paratroopers and civilians. They 
were all in Rwanda to help with the country's democratization. 
But we must not forget that the drama experienced by the vast 
majority of Rwandans is, at the very least, as awful as our own. 
  [Stroobants] Could democracy really be envisaged in Rwanda? 
  [Derycke] We created an elite which was ready for democracy, 
in accordance with the policy defined by the European Union. 
Africa is not entirely a disaster, even if seven or eight 
countries are still lagging behind on the question of freedoms. 
The other donor countries must understand this, together with 
the IMF and the World Bank. The socio-economic problems, the 
poverty, are also factors which partly explain what is happening. 
  [Stroobants] Belgian cooperation will continue? 
  [Derycke] We are already providing humanitarian aid, as of 
today. For the rest, it is clear that we must now consider the 
situation and it is not going to start up again overnight. But 
I cannot stand those who say "It's all over, let them get on 
with it." Africa can be our principal partner. Improving the 
life of the people of Africa can also bring benefits for us. I 
myself am proud that Belgium is maintaining a policy of 
cooperation. In 80 percent of the countries we aid, the policy 
is a genuine success. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Robert Urbain, Belgian foreign trade and </F>
European affairs minister, by unidentified correspondent; place 
and date not given: "On Signing GATT Accords in Marrakech"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The euphoria at the end of December 
when the Uruguay Round was concluded seems to have died down now 
. 
  [Urbain] Having been closely involved, by virtue of the 
European presidency, in the dramatic phase which preceded the 
agreement of 15 December, I can state that the political leaders 
were essentially motivated by the fear of failure to reach an 
agreement after seven years of negotiations. You must remember 
that in 1986, when the Round was launched in Punta del Este, our 
ambitions were as never before, with the inclusion of sectors 
such as textiles, services, and intellectual property. When you 
conclude an agreement on such a scale, you can always think that 
the concessions made are excessive compared with what has been 
obtained. Then, from 15 December, the critical phase has 
developed, for the parliaments, for the sectors, and within the 
non-profit making organizations. But without an agreement, the 
door would have been open for protectionist maneuvers, 
unilateral decisions, and regional accords. Instead of that, we 
have an accord which sets the seal on the birth of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). 
  [Correspondent] Is this WTO going to prevent unilateral 
retaliatory trade measures, such as the U.S. Super 301? 
  [Urbain] Two months ago, when the United States made a new 
attack against Japan based on this Super 301, they wanted to 
demonstrate to the world that the GATT accord would not prevent 
them from using their unilateral retaliatory measures. Until 
very recently, the Americans were strongly against the idea of 
the WTO. They have finally accepted it, while claiming that the 
Super 301 is compatible with the GATT regulations. In any 
event, even if the legal compatibility were to be proved, it is 
an admission of failure, as unilateral measures are weak 
measures. 
  [Correspondent] Does not the WTO threaten to become 
overloaded by adding on new subjects, such as the social clause? 
  [Urbain] Belgium has always insisted on the need to include 
the social clause on the agenda. This has now been achieved. 
But the social clause covers varied problems. When the 
European Commission takes a stance against child labor, we know 
very well that artisanal production in developing countries is 
generally family-based. We are not going to ban imports of 
Pakistani carpets because somewhere, there is a child who is 
working with his parents! But we must fight against the 
deliberate maintaining of low wages and the absence of social 
protection. 
  [Correspondent] Are not the Uruguay Round accords a product 
of the West designed for the West? 
  [Urbain] If we had wanted the GATT to be a "device" at the 
disposal of the West, we would not have opened it up to 122 
countries. It is clear that the problems between the rich 
countries are often different than those between the rich 
countries and the developing countries. For example, we had 
problems with the United States on the film industry, the 
aircraft and aviation sector, iron and steel, and 
telecommunications. For the developing countries on the other 
hand, intellectual ownership was the problem. The GATT was much 
more than a dialogue between the rich countries, even if 80 
percent of world trade is between the rich countries. 
  [Correspondent] Is a country such as China in a position to 
quickly join the ranks of WTO countries? 
  [Urbain] Not all the problems have yet been solved. But this 
giant must respect the rules of international trade. Interest 
in the Chinese market by many large countries is evident, 
starting with Japan and the United States, for which human 
rights pose something of a problem ... but not really so much 
of one. Step by step, this huge market must become integrated 
into the international trading community, hence its idea of 
joining the GATT. Because at present it is not the proper thing 
to be outside the GATT. 
  [Urbain] Belgium is going to sign the GATT accords in 
Marrakech. What benefits will this bring to Belgium and its 
people? 
  [Correspondent] We are, as a small country with a high level 
of economic development, more dependent on foreign trade than 
many other countries. So anything which helps to regulate 
foreign trade, in order to avoid unfair competition or dumping, 
to open up new markets, serves as a stimulus to our exports. We 
can therefore hope to further boost our trade, especially with 
developing countries. 
  [Correspondent] But the liberalization of trade is likely to 
further "globalize" the economy. With even more company 
delocalizations? 
  [Urbain] There have always been delocalizations. I am 
against it when it is an indication of social dumping. Such as 
the transfer of Hoover from France to Great Britain. We all 
make a great deal of noise when companies leave to produce in a 
developing country, but let us begin by stopping delocalization 
at home !

<F P=106> [Article by Tchavdar Arnaoudov: "Claes Asks Sofia To Be </F>
Patient -- He Promises Bilateral and Multilateral Aid From 
Brussels in the Perspective of Integration"] 
  [Text] Sofia -- After nearly 10 years of dormant top level 
diplomatic contacts between Belgium and Bulgaria, the two 
countries have decided to reestablish good relations the roots 
of which go back to the period of the liberation from the 
Ottoman yoke in 1879. Willy Claes, on an official visit to that 
country, encouraged his interlocutors to associate themselves 
with Europe. On Tuesday evening [5 April] he directed the Sofia 
Philharmonic Orchestra, which had included the Symphony in D 
minor by Cesar Franck on the program. 
  During his visit, the Belgian foreign minister met President 
Zhelev, Acting Prime Minister Matinchev, National Assembly 
Chairman Yordanov, and his counterpart Stanislav Daskalov. The 
declaration signed by the two foreign ministers after their 
talks called for "stronger political dialogue, military (...) 
and economic cooperation in a better atmosphere." During a news 
conference, Claes dealt with the theme of the enlargement of the 
European Union [EU] and the Bulgarian authorities' aspirations 
to benefit from it. "You have signed an association agreement 
with the EU which must be ratified by the member states, in 
principle before the end of this year," he said. "This agreement 
must be considered as the final step before membership. The EU 
does not negotiate integration with other blocs but with 
individual countries (...) and makes no distinction between the 
countries of Central and East Europe. The process is being 
delayed because the 12 member states are not ready to receive 
candidate countries. Once agreement has been reached about 
Europe's future, which is to lead to a political union and at 
the same time to economic and monetary union, once effective 
decisionmaking methods have been found, we will be ready to 
discuss enlargement with the countries of Central Europe." 
  So, Claes made an appointment for after 1996. He thinks that 
for the time being, no East European country is capable of 
joining the EU. A double message filtered through his comments: 
He recommended making maximum use of all the cooperation 
formulas in the association agreements with the EU, rather than 
bearing all the obligations linked to membership. At the same 
time, he linked political and economic integration and military 
integration. 
  The Belgian foreign minister also referred to the 
difficulties Bulgaria experienced following the UN embargo 
against Serbia and Montenegro. "Europe is providing indirect 
compensation," he said. "Bulgaria has received some ECU240 
million in aid for its balance of payments." In a few weeks new 
aid measures should be taken, he added. But in his eyes, it was 
of course more important to "obtain as quickly as possible a 
peace agreement that could normalize economic cooperation in 
this region." 
  Finally, Claes was very pleased about the success of his 
visit. He said he was happy to have met "people who want to 
realize a political democracy, but who still have important work 
to do in the field of economic reforms." He expressed his 
conviction that Belgium could help Bulgaria both from the 
bilateral and multilateral point of view so that it could belong 
to the "great European society based on the respect of human 
rights and democracy."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade With European Union Countries </F>
Down by 3 Percent: First Figures on Belgian-Luxemburg Economic 
Union's Intracommunity Trade"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During the first half of last 
year, exports from the Belgian-Luxemburg Economic Union (BLEU) 
to other European Union (EU) countries amounted to 1,530.3 
billion Belgian francs, which was 45 billion Belgian francs or 
2.9 percent less than in the same period of 1992. Some 
observers had anticipated an even greater drop. 
  Imports from the EU dropped by 44.4 billion Belgian francs 
or 
2.8 percent to 1,522 billion. Since the downturn was almost 
equivalent in exports and imports, the trade balance's surplus 
hardly changed. The trade surplus with the EU eroded by 0.6 
billion Belgian francs to 8.3 billion. 
  Exports to Germany, the BLEU's main trading partner, 
decreased by 6.8 percent to452.6 billion Belgian francs, while 
imports from Germany even dwindled by 9.3 percent to 465.6 
billion. Trade with France and the Netherlands, the second and 
third trading partner respectively, also declined. On the other 
hand, trade with the United Kingdom, our fourth trading partner, 
improved. It was the only important EU partner which achieved a 
significant economic growth last year. 
  Additionally, the NIS (National Institute for Statistics) 
confirms that exports to the rest of the world rose sharply, 
while imports from third countries plummeted. During the first 
half of 1993, exports to non-EU countries soared by 36.2 billion 
Belgain francs or 7.3 percent to 531.4 billion. Imports dropped 
by as much as 75 billion Belgian francs or 13.6 percent to 478.4 
billion. As a result, trade with third countries yielded a 
surplus of 53 billion Belgian francs, against a deficit of 58.2 
billion in the same period of 1992. 
  So total exports decreased by 8.8 billion Belgian francs to 
2,061.7 billion, and imports by 119.4 billion to 2,000.4 
billion. As a result, the BLEU had a trade surplus of 61.3 
billion Belgian francs in the first half of 1993, against a 
deficit of 49.3 billion in the same period as the year before. 
  The NIS already has more recent figures on trade with non-EU 
countries, because the processing of extracommunity trade still 
occurs on the basis of customs documents. These data reveal 
that, for 1993 as a whole, exports to the rest of the world 
soared by 15 percent to 1,146 billion Belgian francs, and that 
imports fell by 4 percent to 1,027 billion. 
  The NIS observes that it had to deal with an incomplete 
declaration file and with an irregular response on the part of 
the companies. Therefore, and in order to have results which 
can be compared with the previous years, the institute touched 
up the recorded data. This adjustment occurred on the basis of 
VAT data from the Finance Ministry. 
  Over 31,000 companies must transmit information on imports 
and exports to the NIS. Each of them achieves at least 4.2 
million Belgian francs in intracommunity imports or exports a 
year, while they account for more than 98 percent of overall 
intratrade.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Labor Party Leader Kok Ahead in </F>
Poll"] 
  [Text] At this moment, PvdA [Labor Party] leader Wim Kok is 
the most popular choice for prime minister. Of the Netherlands 
voters, 29 percent would vote for Kok as prime minister, against 
22.5 for D66 [Democrats 66] leader Hans Van Mierlo and 18.5 
percent for CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader Elco 
Brinkman. This was revealed in a survey conducted by Interview 
Office on behalf of the ANP Press Agency and Nova, a TV current 
affairs program. 
  Compared to four weeks ago, Kok took a remarkable step 
forward. At that time, 26.0 percent voted for Van Mierlo, 24.3 
percent for Brinkman, and only 19.5 percent for Kok. Just like 
four weeks ago, VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
leader Bolkestein is lagging far behind the three others. He is 
now the most popular choice for prime minister for 11.4 percent 
of the voters, against 10.1 percent four weeks ago. 
  Kok's progress is mainly due to an increasing popularity 
among voters from his own PvdA and from GroenLinks [Green Left]. 
Four weeks ago, hardly 70 percent of PvdA voters and only 20 
percent of GroenLinks voters wanted Kok as prime minister. 
These percentages have now risen to 88 and 52 percent, 
respectively.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "System Can Jeopardize PvdA-VVD-D66 </F>
Coalition"] 
  [Text] The future of social security will become a tough 
issue during the formation of a "purple" coalition (PvdA [Labor 
Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and D66 
[Democrats 66], without the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]). 
Both D66 and PvdA are opposed to the system the liberals would 
like to implement. 
  This was revealed during last Sunday's radio debate between 
the leaders of the four major parties. It was the politicians' 
first direct meeting in the parliamentary elections campaign. 
  The D66 leader, Hans Van Mierlo, even stated that any 
government agreement which provides for a system, is out of the 
question. In such a system, employees would only receive a 
basic allowance in case of unemployment or disability. They 
would have to take out an additional insurance for themselves. 
  Van Mierlo and PvdA leader Kok had serious doubts about such 
additional insurance. According to [VVD leader] Bolkestein, 
however, such a system is perfectly feasible. He referred to 
the situation of the self-employed. CDA leader Brinkman said 
that employers and employees could reach agreements on 
additional insurance plans during the Collective Labor Agreement 
negotiations. 
  The D66 has been the strongest advocate of a "purple" 
coalition for some time. The possibility of such a cabinet has 
become greater, now that it has been suggested in CDA circles 
that the party should go voluntarily into opposition if the 
election results turn out to be as disastrous as anticipated by 
the polls. 
  CDA leader Brinkman, however, rules out this possibility, 
for 
now: "It would be deplorable if we would create the impression 
that we are preparing ourselves to be in the opposition." 
  For the VVD, discussing a "purple" coalition has become 
"normal," Bolkestein says. He argues that both winners of the 
next elections, most likely his own party and the D66, should be 
definitely included in the new cabinet. He sees either PvdA or 
CDA as a third potential cabinet member. 
  Within the PvdA, a "purple" coalition is not rejected 
altogether. During a radio discussion, however, Kok referred to 
the problems which can be expected with the VVD regarding the 
future of social security. "I am mostly curious about the 
differences between the policy proposals of the D66 and VVD. 
There is definitely a difference between both liberal parties." 
The PvdA leader is known to be more favorable to a cabinet 
comprising the CDA, PvdA, and D66. 
  As could be expected, the party leaders were rather gentle 
toward one another. The parties do not want to exclude each 
other. Due to the expected election results, at least three out 
of the four parties will be needed to form a cabinet which has a 
majority in the Lower Chamber.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today launched an 
outspoken attack on America's refusal to give full support to 
plans to boost United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
  In a speech in New York, he said Britain could not 
understand 
why the United States did not back plans to send an extra 8,250 
troops and instead approved an increase of just 3,500. 
  "We must not put ourselves in the situation where we lack 
the 
tools to carry out the job," he told the Carnegie Council for 
Ethics and International Affairs. 
  He urged the United States to back the full increase when 
the 
proposal returned to the UN Security Council and "to throw their 
full weight behind the peace process." 
  Mr Rifkind will intensify his campaign when he meets U.S. 
Defence Secretary William Perry in Washington tomorrow. He will 
attempt to persuade him to support the full deployments of extra 
peacekeepers and to send American ground troops for the first 
time. 
  Britain believes a substantial U.S. force of ground troops 
is 
vital if peace is to be restored successfully across Bosnia. 
  In his speech, Mr Rifkind made clear that the UN would 
maintain its impartiality in Bosnia. He said air strikes could 
be launched against any of the warring factions if they were 
putting UN forces under threat and if a request for air support 
came from the UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose. 
But he warned it was important to weigh up the consequences of 
future air strikes. 
  "We must think where this kind of activity is likely to lead 
us and be prepared to manage our future responses so that we get 
where we want to go," he said.

<F P=106> [George Jones report: "Air Raids May Not Be Over, Says </F>
Major"] 
  [Text] Mr Major gave warning yesterday that NATO would 
launch more air strikes against Bosnian Serbs if they continued 
attacking safe areas such as Gorazde. "Close air support will 
remain available to UN commanders. They will be able to call on 
it again if they consider it necessary," the Prime Minister told 
the Commons. "There will be no loss of nerve here or, I hope, 
anywhere else." 
  Speaking during Question Time, he said he hoped the Serbs 
would learn a lesson from what had happened "so that further use 
of close air support is unnecessary." 
  Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, stressed that UN 
forces were not taking sides. "They do not intend to be drawn 
into open-ended intervention for or against any of the parties. 
But the international community will not tolerate attacks on 
Unprofor (UN Protection Forces), and attacks on the safe areas 
must cease," he said. 
  The NATO air strikes received all-party backing, though some 
MPs were concerned that Russia had not been consulted in 
advance. Mr Hurd said in a statement that he was in touch with 
Mr Andrey Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister "about the 
important Russian role in this effort." 
  He later said: "If you're going to take air action of this 
kind...it has to be done quickly. This took 44 minutes between 
the request and the action. It is precisely because of the need 
for speed that both the UN and NATO agreed procedures which 
allowed for speed. That of course, did not mean that member 
states could be consulted in advance." 
  Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said 
Labour accepted the strikes were authorised by the UN Security 
Council but questioned why it took two weeks to act. 
  Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the air 
strikes were necessary to support the authority of the UN and 
for the protection of UN peacekeepers. He said the West must 
keep its nerve, maintain its military determination and increase 
diplomatic pressure.

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Bundestag </F>
in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen; this is a 
government statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, 
but you will understand that, first of all, I would like to say 
that we are glad all Germans managed to get out of Rwanda 
safely, and that we are particularly happy about the fact that 
the 11 Deutsche Welle employees were evacuated by Belgian 
paratroopers yesterday. [applause] I expressed our cordial 
thanks to the Belgian Government, the Belgian foreign minister 
yesterday. I think it was appropriate, because the Belgian 
paratroopers have done a good, remarkable, and for us most 
important, job. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen; the situation in the former Yugoslavia 
cannot be easily reduced to a common denominator. All in all 
one can say that it has improved. Bosnians and Croats have 
displayed their serious intention to overcome last year's 
confrontation on the basis of the Washington agreement, and to 
establish a federal state together. For the first time people 
in the conflict area at least believe in the possibility of 
peace. Sarajevo has been freed -- at least for the moment -- 
from the suffocating grip of Serbian terrorist attacks, and can 
hope for life to normalize in the city with the help of the 
United Nations, even though new incidents did, unfortunately, 
occur yesterday. 
  In Mostar, the people are waiting for the United Nations to 
set up an administration that is to be headed by Hans Koschnick. 
Everything has to be done now to preserve the positive momentum, 
and everything has to be done not to frustrate the incipient 
hopes. 
  There is even some light on the horizon in Croatian-Serbian 
relations. The 29 March cease-fire is being complied with and 
implemented, which means that Dalmatian areas that have so far 
been in danger are now no longer within the range of the Serb 
artillery. This is of considerable importance for the tourist 
trade and, thus, for the entire economy in the region. 
  The next important step has to be the restoration of 
important infrastructure at the level of transportation and the 
energy supply. Negotiations on a political solution can be 
started on the basis of such a modus vivendi. 
  The Federal Government welcomes the strong U.S. commitment 
in 
the peace efforts, which we have repeatedly called for, and the 
constructive cooperation of Russia. The role of these two 
countries is of vital importance. Russia must be involved in 
the efforts to seek a political solution. Without the 
participation of Russia there will not be a solution in the 
former Yugoslavia. On the other hand, one is also entitled to 
expect Russia to continue to support the UN Security Council 
resolution. 
  The contribution of the EU must not be forgotten, either. 
Yes, we Europeans did not manage to get this conflict, which is 
actually a European conflict, under control on our own. Yet, 
the rapprochement between Bosnians and Croats, the demand for a 
satisfactory territorial solution in Bosnia, and the idea of a 
modus vivendi in the Serb-occupied territories in Croatia -- 
these concepts have been developed by the EU as a result of the 
impetus provided by myself, together with my French colleague 
Juppe. 
  It is true that the negotiations on the cease-fire in 
Krajina 
took place in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Nevertheless, they 
were chaired -- and unfortunately such things tend to be 
overlooked -- by a German diplomat on the instructions of the 
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. We are in 
constant close contact with the main parties involved; and with 
our Foreign Ministry representatives we participated decisively, 
of course, also in the Bosnian-Croatian negotiations in 
Washington. 
  At the moment it is of utmost importance that the peace 
process remains credible. This means two things: There must be 
no more Serb occupations, and the suffering of the people in the 
towns besieged by the Serbs must come to an end. [applause] 
  The combat operation of NATO aircraft is to be seen in this 
connection. The operation was justified, necessary, and right. 
Over the last two days, the chancellor and myself have discussed 
the overall situation in former Yugoslavia and these specific 
operations in detail with the secretary general of the United 
Nations. The legal basis for the operation is undisputed. 
Security Council Resolution 836, which has also been supported 
by the Russians, provides for the use of airborne strike forces 
to support UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. The Serb move 
toward Gorazde and the heavy attack on the city endangered the 
security of the UN military observers stationed there. A UN 
soldier was wounded. Following this, the UNPROFOR command, with 
the permission of the special envoy of the UN secretary general, 
asked NATO to provide airborne support. It was granted on 10 
April. On 11 April it was repeated. This was in keeping with 
the procedure laid down for such cases. On 10 June 1993, NATO 
decided on the basis of Security Council Resolution 836 to make 
such protection measures possible. For this reason a special 
procedure was not necessary within NATO. For reasons of time it 
was not possible to inform all the other parties concerned. On 
11 April, the UN Security Council unanimously agreed on the 
operation, with the exception of Russia. But Russia did not 
voice any reservations under international law or any other 
legal concerns. It only criticized the lack of consultation 
before the operation. But let me say it again: Bringing the 
case before the Security Council before every operation would 
impair the purpose of Resolution 836 and make it impossible to 
provide efficient, swift, immediate protection against such 
attacks, especially against UNPROFOR troops. 
  I would also like to point out again that this was not an 
operation equal to the Sarajevo threat, but a specific operation 
in response to a specific attack against UNPROFOR troops. We 
think that a clear, decisive signal was necessary. The Serb 
attack on a UN protection zone is a provocation of the community 
of states. And we all know what the capture of a largely Muslim 
city by the Serbs would mean for the population. The United 
Nations could not allow the protection zones it established to 
be disregarded. On 9 April, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
-- he explained this again yesterday -- himself warned the 
Bosnian Serbs against continuing their attacks on Gorazde and 
instructed UNPROFOR to use all available means to achieve a Serb 
withdrawal. After Sarajevo, Gorazde is another symbol for the 
suffering of the population in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For months, 
some 65,000 people, most of them Muslims, have been trapped 
there. Unfortunately, only very few humanitarian aid convoys 
have managed to get through to the city. It must now become 
clear whether the community of states will manage to extend to 
Gorazde what it has achieved in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, there 
are a number of Sarajevos, Gorazdes -- a fact that is all too 
easily forgotten. We urgently have to try and approach the 
other crisis spots as we did in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, this 
will be the only possibility. The operation was right, also 
with a view to the peace process. The community of states can 
only call upon the parties to the conflict to find a political 
solution if it remains credible in its own resolutions. The Serb 
side is in control of some 70 percent of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The community of states demands that the Serbs should 
withdraw from about 20 percent of the Bosnian territory. At an 
earlier point, the Serbian side expressed its basic willingness 
to do so. Thus, a withdrawal is required and not another 
advance. [applause] 
  One can only recommend to the Serbs in their very own 
interest that they take the determination of the community of 
states seriously and renounce further military advances. 
Instead, they should constructively participate in efforts to 
achieve a peaceful solution. Above all, this includes the 
submission of a qualitatively satisfactory proposal for the 
territory. 
  As far as Russia is concerned, I would like to stress that, 
if a repetition of the situation of the past few days is to be 
prevented, the best and most effective method is -- I also 
discussed this with Foreign Minister Kozyrev -- for Russia to 
continue to exert influence on the Serbian side. In this 
respect, I would like to point out that the Russians are 
cooperating in an extraordinarily constructive manner. I just 
mentioned that. Their influence on the Serbs was decisive for 
the withdrawal of the troops in and around Sarajevo, for 
ensuring access to Tuzla for UNPROFOR and UN troops, and 
hopefully for other peace efforts, too. [applause] 
  If the Serbian side should take the legitimate intervention 
by the United Nations to ensure the resolution adopted by the UN 
Security Council as an opportunity to question the whole peace 
process -- which I cannot imagine -- doubts would be justified 
that they have ever been ready for a peace agreement that is 
acceptable to the other parties to the conflict and the 
community of states. The Federal Government hopes for the 
continuation of the processes that have been initiated in the 
past few weeks. Germany will be confronted with high 
expectations concerning the stabilization of the relationship 
between Muslims and Croats, which is still difficult, and, above 
all, concerning the implementation of a peace solution for the 
whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which will hopefully be achieved 
soon. This applies particularly to our role in the 
administration of Mostar by the EU. I explicitly thank Mr. 
Koschnick for his readiness to assume the task of the 
administrator of the EU, which is not exactly easy. [applause] 
I can only say -- he knows that from various conversations we 
have held -- that he can be sure of our solidarity and support. 
An appointment has rarely been received so positively in the EU 
as that of Mr. Koschnick in Greece when we asked him to assume 
this position. Good luck! [applause] 
  The international community will also rely on us regarding 
the opening of Tuzla Airport and aid for the reconstruction of 
the territories affected by the war, particularly because we 
cannot participate in the military elements of the pacification. 
Our commitment in the humanitarian sphere, where we have done a 
great deal, must be maintained. I would like to thank the 
German people once more, who have accepted over 400,000 refugees 
from the former Yugoslavia. I would like to repeat proudly that 
this is more than twice the number that all other European 
countries have accepted together. This is an astonishing 
achievement. During the talks in Washington, this was honored 
in a special manner, particularly by the Muslim and Croatian 
side, and special thanks were conveyed to us -- also for our 
humanitarian commitment in general. One should not ignore or 
forget that, as far as financial contributions and aid are 
concerned, we are in second place. Thus, we need not hide our 
light under a bushel. 
  However, in view of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, 
which continuous to be terrible, the world community must not 
grow tired and lose interest. This is the biggest danger that 
exists in the sphere of humanitarian efforts. I would like to 
repeat that, in view of the terrible situation, we must not grow 
tired and lame, or lose interest. Today's support by the German 
Bundestag for the Federal Government's policy on the former 
Yugoslavia should be viewed as a signal in this spirit. Thank 
you very much.

<F P=106> [Statement by Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the SPD </F>
Bundestag group, in the Bundestag in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen; the 
situation in the former Yugoslavia continues to be disturbing. 
People continue to be killed, displaced, arrested, and raped in 
the war there. Nevertheless, and I do agree with the foreign 
minister here, there are now chances for a political solution. 
What has made me cautiously optimistic are the positive change 
in the situation of Sarajevo, on the one hand, and, the 
reopening of Tuzla Airport, on the other; and finally also the 
fact that Croats and Bosnians have agreed on a joint federation. 
This agreement might become the starting point for the 
restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yet, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, this is only realistic if it will, ultimately, be 
possible to include the Bosnians Serbs in this process, too. 
However, this does not seem likely at the moment. 
  Nevertheless, I am cautiously optimistic today, because, for 
one thing, the Russians are apparently constructively 
participating in the efforts to achieve a peaceful solution. I 
have said apparently because it is indeed not very easy to 
understand Russian foreign policy against the background of the 
insecurities in domestic policy. The most differing statements 
have been made in connection with Yugoslavia, even from the 
ranks of the Russian Government. Still Russia's role, which has 
been positive to date, should be honored. I think it is wise to 
continue to include the Russians in the political process. 
[applause] 
  On the other hand, it is evident that America's 
determination 
has increased. The Americans are today quite obviously ready to 
intervene more actively than in the past -- politically and 
militarily. Before, they were conspicuously reluctant to act 
because -- as I think quite rightly -- they regarded the 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia first and foremost as a 
European problem. Yet, the Europeans were unable to achieve a 
European solution to the problem. Foreign minister, without 
wanting explicitly to criticize anybody, my assessment of 
Europe's role is far more negative than yours. I do not want to 
go as far as claiming -- which is also being done, and not only 
in FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE -- that through their kind of conflict 
management, the Europeans have even made the conflict worse. 
Whether this is appropriate and what role German foreign policy 
has played, will ultimately have to be clarified by historians. 
I am, therefore, not asking whether one could not have settled 
the conflict through a political solution at an earlier stage. 
  For today, I am saying that there may be a chance for a 
solution, and I say it very clearly: there is such a chance and 
mainly because, led by the United States and on behalf of the 
United Nations, NATO has become politically and militarily 
active. [applause] 
  Such military intervention is always problematic because it 
is dangerous. There is the danger of escalation, which was 
pointed out by the foreign minister -- and I agree. At the same 
time, the statement remains true that the UN/NATO ultimatum did 
work in Sarajevo, and one can only hope that the active 
intervention in Gorazde, which the chairman of my party 
described as necessary, will help to bring the Serbs to reason, 
and -- I would like to add -- that it is not misunderstood by 
the Bosnians as a sign of one-sided support. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen; the responsible officials on the 
Serbian side should now consider very carefully what they intend 
to do after the very cautiously sized UN military intervention. 
First reactions are rather worrying. Yet, the United Nations 
is not waging a war against the Serbian people, and neither is 
NATO. Both, with NATO, incidentally, acting as an agent for the 
United Nations, are protecting their own people who are engaged 
in the difficult attempt to save lives in the conflict areas and 
to create concrete conditions for a political solution of the 
conflict. 
  The responsible people on the Serbian side should draw the 
right conclusion and return to the negotiating table. German 
diplomacy should contribute to this, also for example by using 
its good, also personal, relations with the Russian Government. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen; putting an end to the suffering of 
the population in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be the real task of 
German foreign policy. The German foreign minister should make 
an effort toward this; he can count on our support in this 
matter. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen; let me make another, somewhat bitter 
remark in this connection. We are once again discussing 
Yugoslavia here, somewhat more optimistically than on former 
occasions. The situation there worries us. One reason it 
worries us is that we see television pictures from there every 
day. There are also a few pictures coming from Kigali. There 
are hardly any pictures from Afghanistan and none from Angola, 
where far more people have been killed in the ongoing civil war 
than in former Yugoslavia. I would not like to make any 
comparisons, and I am not judging. The so-called CNN effect 
must, however, be taken into account in politics. Public opinion 
is important. It is produced, and it influences national and 
international actions. This influence must, however, not be a 
determining one, because this would make us ask whether our 
policies are morally justified. Morals is not the only 
yardstick. What also counts is one's own interests and the 
interests of one's partners. We should, however, avoid double 
standards. [applause] 
  Let me say a final word, Ladies and Gentlemen. Our friend 
Hans Koschnick will go to Mostar, probably in May, in order to 
help with reconstruction there. This is not an easy task, but a 
difficult, even dangerous one. The fact that you are available 
for this task, dear Hans, proves your courage and great 
humanitarian commitment. Thank you very much, and good luck.

<F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "Growing Readiness for Bundeswehr </F>
Missions"] 
  [Text] Readiness is growing within the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] to allow the participation of the 
Bundeswehr in UN peacekeeping missions in the former Yugoslavia. 
At the same time, leading CDU politicians have been trying to 
put the statement by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that German ground 
troops must not be deployed in the Balkans because of the 
historical burden in proper perspective. One day before the 
arrival of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in Bonn, the 
CDU presidium discussed the war in Bosnia. Considerations 
apparently also played a role that the debate on the 
participation in UN operations might lead to a clear 
delimitation vis-a-vis the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] during the election campaign. 
  After CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group 
leader 
and deputy chairman Karl-Heinz Hornhues, Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe, too, seems to have adopted a different attitude on this 
issue. In an interview that was distributed at the Defense 
Ministry, Ruehe stated: "If a peace plan were to be 
implemented, we should be able to go to the limits of our 
capacities." 
  In the past, Ruehe spoke only vaguely about a commitment on 
the fringes of the conflict zone -- at NATO airports in Italy, 
for example, and by establishing a field hospital in Croatia. 
He now only excluded participation in operations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the interview, he stated: "German 
soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina would rather be part of the 
problem and not of a solution because their commitment and their 
work would not be supported by all parties to the conflict. 
Thus, the deployment of German soldiers there is not 
realistic." Defense Ministry officials have pointed out that, 
with his statements, Ruehe has increased the range of 
possibilities. It would be conceivable for pioneers to 
participate in the reconstruction of the country and for 
transport troops to resupply the UN troop. However, German 
soldiers will not monitor peace with weapons in their hands as 
long as the Constitutional Court does not pass a ruling on the 
deployment of Bundeswehr soldiers outside the NATO area. 
  Bundestag group chairman Schaeuble stressed two weeks ago 
during a visit to Washington that, "basically," the government 
will participate in a UN mission to safeguard peace in the 
Balkans. NATO cannot sustain a peacekeeping mission if Germany 
refuses to participate, he added.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government insists that 
human rights must be respected in Turkey. Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel, speaking in a government statement in the 
Bundestag on Wednesday [13 April], said that friendly relations 
with Turkey remain "of great value" for Germany. It is, 
however, all the more important to continue the "critical" 
dialogue with the Turkish Government. Now it must be pointed 
out that the situation concerning human rights and the situation 
of the Kurdish population in Turkey are "not satisfactory." 
They have even worsened, he declared. 
  At the same time the foreign minister rejected the 
accusation 
that the German Government is allowing arms supplied by Germany 
to be used against the Kurdish civilian population. In all 
treaties, Turkey has undertaken to use these arms and other 
equipment exclusively for defense against armed attack. This 
stance was reaffirmed by Ankara most recently on 7 April, Kinkel 
added. Nevertheless the government has decided to postpone the 
dispatch of an arms consignment originally planned for 15 April 
until such time as an investigation has been completed into 
evidence to the contrary. This evidence, which was supplied by 
human rights groups, is being carefully examined in the Foreign 
Ministry, he asserted. 
  Kinkel emphasized that "as long as the accusations are not 
conclusively proved, the German Government has no reason to 
doubt the detailed assurances of allegiance to the treaties by a 
friendly, allied partner." Turkey has said that equipment from 
stocks of the National People's Army [of the former GDR] is 
indeed deployed in the Kurdish area but is only being used to 
secure the borders, particularly those with Iraq and Syria. 
Ankara has also pointed out that similar equipment has been 
supplied by Russia as well. 
  The foreign minister also made another emphatic appeal to 
all 
the Kurds living in Germany not to fight out their conflicts in 
the Federal Republic. Anyone who abuses the right to 
hospitality and commits a criminal offense has to "expect the 
full force of our laws, with criminal proceedings and 
extradition and deportation." Of course, every individual case 
will be examined to ascertain whether the person concerned would 
face the death penalty, torture, or any other treatment 
violating the law in Turkey, he said.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Social Democratic Party 
[SPD] has strongly criticized the German Government's military 
aid for Turkey. It has never been clarified whether these 
weapons have been used against Kurds, SPD Bundestag group 
chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose said in the Bundestag today. If the 
German Foreign Ministry is now requesting proof of such 
allegations from human rights groups, then this is "evidence of 
a miserable failure on the part of the Foreign Ministry over 
many years." 
  Klose advocated civilian CSCE observers investigating 
conditions in Turkey. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party [FDP]) must launch a relevant initiative 
immediately. The CSCE has responsibility for this, not least 
because the conflict is threatening to extend beyond Turkey. 
  Klose added that Germany is greatly affected because the 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) does not shrink back from 
terrorism even in the Federal Republic. This is unacceptable. 
Klose stressed that those who abuse the right to hospitality 
must be "prosecuted, sentenced, and expelled." However, the 
expulsion orders can only be executed "if, in each individual 
case, proof is furnished that the deportee will not be tortured 
or killed in Turkey." [passage omitted]

official visit, has held talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
During the discussion, Mr. Goh pointed out that Germany and 
Singapore are natural partners and complement each other's 
strength in the region. Mr. Goh's trip, his first as prime 
minister, is taking place amid more positive prospects for the 
German economy. Most economists agree that the German economy 
will start picking up again this year with GDP [gross domestic 
product] growth between 0.5 to 1 percent. During the trip, both 
sides will formalize the German-Singapore business forum. It is 
to encourage companies from both sides to form joint ventures in 
third countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD General Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F>
Ollaf Opitz; place and date not given: "A Great Similarity"] 
  [Text] [Opitz] The United States wants to test Rudolf 
Scharping to see if he is a suitable candidate for chancellor. 
The most important examination question: Does an SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany]-governed Germany demand a special 
role for itself in security policy? 
  [Verheugen] Not at all. The basis of German security policy 
is fixed. That means a firm presence in NATO and in the 
European Union. Germany remains a reliable alliance partner 
that adheres to its duties. That is one of the important 
messages that Rudolf Scharping will deliver in the United 
States. The close German-U.S. partnership is more than just a 
security-political challenge for the SPD. In this partnership, 
we want to introduce a new dimension, that of economic and 
environmental policy, something which the Federal Government has 
badly neglected. In this sphere we notice a harmony with 
President Clinton's own views. 
  [Opitz] The Clinton administration also wants to know if 
Chancellor Scharping would permit German units to be involved in 
UN operations. 
  [Verheugen] That is an artificial subject. The UN is not at 
war, and NATO cannot independently assume tasks that go beyond 
its mission of common defense. It can only do so within a UN 
framework, and in the future the UN will not demand that German 
troops are sent into action. 
  [Opitz] But the UN secretary general sees things 
differently. 
  [Verheugen] Butrus-Ghali thinks Germany could support the UN 
in various ways. The UN needs unlimited assistance. We are 
ready to give it. But I do not understand why everyone keeps 
talking about combat operations. Where on earth should UN units 
fight? On the contrary, after the experience of Somalia and 
Bosnia, the UN is reverting to its classic peacekeeping 
function, and not combat operations. Germany can take part in 
anything that is undertaken within this peacekeeping framework. 
But just like any other country, including the United States, 
in every single case we reserve the right to check whether 
German involvement is expedient or not. 
  [Opitz] That sounds just like Hans-Ulrich Klose's demand for 
blue helmets and more. 
  [Verheugen] This is not a question of deploying blue 
helmets. It is something that has developed in the UN. For 
years, it was widely believed in Germany that the blue helmets 
do nothing except monitor cease-fires, whereby people tended to 
forget that the blue helmets have the right and duty to perform 
their job with reasonable force if necessary. 
  [Opitz] That is a clever way of putting it. Even so it 
sounds surprisingly like what the SPD was saying months ago. 
  [Verheugen] The SPD learned a lesson that was reflected in 
our party resolution in Wiesbaden. We are going one step 
further than the UN. We want to see the use of blockades as a 
means of preventing or stopping wars. In such a case, blockades 
can be backed up militarily. 
  [Opitz] But you will have problems with a potential 
coalition partner. Since the Mannheim decision by the Greens 
that they would leave NATO, the idea of a red-green Federal 
Government is a nightmare for the United States. 
  [Verheugen] The SPD does not want a coalition partner that 
calls for withdrawal from NATO and the abolition of the 
Bundeswehr. There will be no such coalition. The Bundeswehr 
retains its classic defense function. We want to provide it 
with a certain future. In any case, NATO will be needed until 
we have a stable all-European system of security that involves 
the United States. Scharping will tell the United States in no 
uncertain terms that there is no German partner for the kind of 
policy that the Greens formulated in Mannheim. Our U.S. friends 
can count on it.

<F P=106> [Article by Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, European policy </F>
spokeswoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany: "Beyond 
Maastricht"] 
  [Text] The European Union (EU) is getting bigger. The 
latest decisions have made it clear that the 12 states that 
concluded a treaty in Maastricht can be accompanied on their 
path toward further European cooperation by Austria, Sweden, 
Finland, and Norway. What remains is to work to have the people 
of these four states seize this opportunity courageously. 
  The history of European integration has been a story of 
success up to now, the luster of which seems to be visible only 
to those outside. Peace, cooperation across borders, and 
prosperity for most people are part of this success story. It 
continues: The accession of the Scandinavian states and Austria 
strengthens those who have long been working for the realization 
of a social union and an environmental union. A country like 
Austria, for instance, strengthens those in the EU who are of 
the opinion that European traffic policy must finally take the 
interests of nature and the environment into account. This also 
benefits the people in Germany. We, too, do not want endless 
streams of traffic rolling along German highways in the growing 
single market. 
  With the accession of these four former EFTA [European Free 
Trade Association] states, however, the bell also tolls the hour 
of truth for the governments of the member states themselves. 
The question is: What kind of Europe do we want? A Europe 
that is based on the principle of mere national cooperation 
between its governments and on a free trade zone? Or a Europe 
that can shape economic, social, ecological, and political 
matters, that is, one that wants to be more than the sum of its 
member states? In view of the globalization of problems and the 
internationalization of developments, the answer seems quite 
clear to me. 
  All the more surprised one must be about those voices in the 
German discussions that, following the pattern of 
national-conservative thinking, call European integration into 
question as no longer necessary after the realization of German 
unification. Such a position, however, grossly contradicts -- 
quite in contrast to its public justification -- Germany's 
interests. It is bad that such positions are meanwhile also 
being advocated by parts of one government party in Germany, and 
that against its better knowledge, just to preserve its 
political power. This means the danger of a radicalizing 
nationalism that shifts toward the right and entails dangers 
just like those that arose after the first German unification 
120 years ago. 
  Loosening Germany's European integration would mean the 
formation of new "alliances" and thus new isolation. Economic 
prosperity, too, requires European integration. The economic 
benefits of an integrated Europe are hardly questioned any 
longer now. The preservation of European competitiveness in the 
triad and the possibilities of a common research and development 
policy, the necessary economic policy coordination, and 
initiatives for growth and stability in Europe will not work 
without an EU that is capable of action. 
  More integration is also necessary to facilitate a social 
dimension in Europe. The conditions of the single market may 
lead to serious deregulations and social dumping if common 
minimum standards are not ensured. So far, Great Britain has 
been blocking potential progress in this field -- a comfortable 
state of affairs, since in this way none of the other 11 member 
states is forced to state its sociopolitical intentions clearly. 
  Chernobyl has shown that environmental pollution does not 
stop at borders. Therefore, setting down ecological standards 
must not remain a national matter; after all, common survival is 
at stake. 
  Freedom and democracy, a rule-of-law state, the protection 
of 
minorities, economic development, and social justice are the 
bases for the preservation of internal and external peace 
throughout Europe. Today the observation of human rights, basic 
freedoms, democracy, and the principles of a rule-of-law state 
is no longer exclusively part of a state's internal affairs but 
are affairs that concern all the CSCE member states. The EU is 
currently leading this process through political integration. 
  In economic and ecological terms a national state is no 
longer sovereign, anyway. Europe's citizens have high 
expectations for the EU and justified expectations regarding the 
EU's benefits for their personal concerns. An EU that is not 
transparent and removed from the citizens and could not 
legitimize its actions in the eyes of its 350 million citizens 
cannot be successful. 
  The EU needs reform to the head and the limbs, if it is not 
to become incapable of action. Not only is it necessary to 
strengthen further the European Parliament's rights to 
participate in decisionmaking, but also to adhere strictly to 
the principle of subsidiarity. Most problems can be solved more 
appropriately at the local, laender, or national level. The EU 
must become more transparent and democratic. 
  The desirable strengthening of the political role of the EU, 
the European Commission, and its more effective control by the 
European Parliament, the necessary majority decisions in the 
Council of Ministers on all issues of European legislation can 
probably be achieved only if future conferences for 
restructuring the contractual bases of the EU also have national 
parliaments and the European Parliament participating. 
Therefore, it would be a fatal mistake if the conference, which 
is to review the Maastricht Treaties in 1996, were to be 
prepared once again in the old way of "secret government 
conferences." Rather, it should provide the opportunity to hold 
a large-scale public debate in our country in 1995 about the 
further development of Europe. Any new contractual shaping of 
the EU must be made subject to a vote by the people in Germany 
and in the other EU member states. 
  The idea of democracy comes from Europe. The EU is to become 
a model of democracy, transparency, participation, and 
responsibility. The alternative would be: a failed hope and -- 
violence, because disintegration produces violence, as we see 
every day.
