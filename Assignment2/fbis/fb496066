  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Social Democrats [SPD] will 
not agree to the Bundeswehr's participation in UN combat 
missions under any circumstances. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
made it clear in Bonn today that his party's political position 
will not change, even when the legal disputes have been 
clarified before the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  Following his return from a trip to the United States, 
Scharping said in Bonn that he assumes the judges in Karlsruhe 
will insist on involving the Bundestag in a decision on the 
participation of German servicemen in UN missions.

<F P=106> [Einar Koch report: "Kinkel: Do Not Save on the </F>
Bundeswehr"] 
  [Text] An open quarrel has broken out in the government 
coalition in Bonn about the future of the Bundeswehr! 
  Free Democratic Party Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel is firmly against plans by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
to reduce the strength of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to 320,000. 
  Kinkel told BILD: "The Bundeswehr finally needs planning 
security, and for the families as well. In the long run, the 
discussion cannot be such that one says: We have such and such 
an amount of money, and for that we can afford such and such a 
Bundeswehr. If I had my say, the decided strength of 370,000 
should be maintained if at all possible. I do see the financial 
problems, but in this case one has to reexamine all other 
possibilities of saving money." 
  Ruehe wants to present his concept for the Bundeswehr to the 
Bundestag this week.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Web With Many Spiders"] </F>
  [Text] The 15 cm by 18 cm color photograph only shows the 
scorched fragment of a green synthetic resin board. It looks 
like nothing at all; the fragment is no larger than a 
fingernail. Only an enlargement reveals the soldering typical 
of a circuit board. 
  The photograph of plastic casing consisting of two parts 
does 
not reveal much at first sight either. The upper and lower 
parts are connected by a cable. Two dials, which have been 
affixed to the piece of plastic, are not visible on the outside. 
  Electronics experts immediately know what this means. The 
synthetic material is bottom plate [Platine] and the two dials 
allow for programming of a timer. This kind of timer is 
essential for the precise detonation of a bomb. 
  Men who display Victorian discretion have been presenting 
the photographs during secret investigations in Berlin for 
months. Scouts from secret services all over the world have been 
flocking together: It is almost like the coldest days of the 
Cold War when Berlin was the spy capital. 
  It is a home game for German investigators. Officials from 
the Cologne-based Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, colleagues from the State Protection Office, 
investigators from the Wiesbaden Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations Office (BKA), and prosecutors from Frankfurt and 
Berlin are trying to solve the most mysterious crime story of 
recent years: the story of the timer. 
  The timer, which is not even worth 400 German marks [DM], is 
what the Americans term a "smoking gun" -- an irrefutable piece 
of evidence. The only question is: In whose hands was it? The 
timer was used by terrorists to detonate the bomb that ripped to 
pieces the Pan Am jumbo jet "Maid of the Seas" over the Scottish 
village of Lockerbie on 21 December 1988. All 259 passengers, 
primarily U.S. citizens, died; 11 residents of Lockerbie were 
killed by falling wreckage. There were a total of 270 victims. 
  Lockerbie -- the place-name has become a synonym for lunatic 
international terrorism. For many, the case was considered 
officially solved, at least until now. 
  In 1991, American and British investigative authorities 
revealed that Libyan secret service agents Amin Chalifa Fuheima, 
who was 35 at the time, and Abd-al-Bassit Ali al-Mikrahi, who 
was 39, were behind the Boeing 747 crash. The sinister villain 
of the international community, the self-proclaimed protector of 
Arab terrorists, Libya's head of state Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi, was 
once again exposed as a murderer. 
  The U.S. Justice Ministry demanded in vain that both 
suspects 
be extradited. The United Nations then imposed an embargo, which 
was intensified last November, against Libya. 
  Now, new facts have shaken the carefully formulated 
construction of the investigators, the indictments that are 
ready in Washington and Edinburgh. Secret service men and 
investigators are talking about a hot "German lead." 
  German Lockerbie prosecutor Volker Rath says: "It threatens 
to jeopardize the charges leveled by the Americans and the 
Scots." The Frankfurter investigator says: "Everyone who is 
familiar with the matter can put one and one together." 
  Rath is even more direct in internal reports prepared for 
his 
top boss, Hesse Justice Minister Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt. 
In short: No German judge would be able to issue an arrest 
warrant for the suspects on the basis of the evidence that has 
been collected to date. 
  Rath, 40, is one of a handful of Lockerbie experts who has 
been working on the case internationally. The Meckenheim BKA, 
which cooperates closely with the American FBI and Scotland 
Yard, has an office in which 450 files are piled high. All of 
them bear a Frankfurt Prosecution Service code number: 50 Js 
42.401/88. 
  Lockerbie was, as Scotland Yard boasts, the "most demanding 
piece of detective work in criminal history." Statements have 
been collected from 15,000 witnesses, 20,000 names have been 
checked, 35,000 photographs assessed, and 180,000 items of 
evidence examined. 
  A German lead in the West came up early on: It is highly 
probable that the deadly cargo came from Frankfurt. According 
to the investigators reconstruction, the suitcase containing the 
bomb -- it was unaccompanied luggage transported by Air Malta 
from that Mediterranean island -- found its way into the German 
air traffic network on the morning of 21 December 1988. 
  At 1307, a computer issued the code number B 8849 for the 
bronze colored Samsonite suitcase. The suitcase containing the 
bomb was then checked onto flight PA 103, Frankfurt-London -- 
where it was to land before the transatlantic crossing -- 
between 1512 and 1650. The lead that has now electrified 
everyone did not appear at this point. It is completely new and 
leads to the former Ministry of State Security (MfS). 
  Former MfS employees are being questioned. Over the past few 
days, prominent names have appeared on the list of witnesses who 
still have to be questioned. 
  Thus, the prosecution service not only wants to question 
former Politburo members, but also Honecker successor Egon 
Krenz. The point at issue is: Who handed over the timer to 
whom and for what purpose? 
  It is true that no one has expressed the bold suspicion that 
the horrific Lockerbie bloodbath was the work of the Stasi, 
which wanted to perform a service for allied Arab organizations, 
but there already is talk of possible complicity in the murder 
of several hundred people. 
  One thing is certain: Detonation devices of the Lockerbie 
type were found in the possession of the state security 
department -- that is very compelling evidence. The results of 
the investigation to date must be reappraised. 
  From the very beginning, the key to the Lockerbie mystery 
was 
that piece of bottom plate that investigators found on 13 
January 1989 after a laborious search of the wreckage of the 
aircraft, which had been ripped apart. It turned up in the 
wrecked suitcase of terror victim Karen Noonan, having burned a 
hole in the collar of a shirt and embedded itself in it. 
  Technicians removed the fragment with tweezers. After weeks 
of detailed work, Scottish specialist Thomas Hayes identified 
the piece of plastic with production code number PT 30 as part 
of a detonator. 
  The Lockerbie bomb corresponded almost exactly to the 
infernal device that a group of militant Palestinians had build 
two months previously in the Rhineland town of Neus. In both 
cases, the explosive was Semtex H, which had been affixed inside 
a Toshiba radio recorder with fiendish cunning. 
  The difference between the two devices was: The Palestinian 
group in Neus had used a barometric detonator which would have 
resulted in an explosion if there had been a change in air 
pressure, if, for example, an aircraft reached a certain height. 
For a long time, the North Rhine-Westphalian terrorist group, 
which came under the Syrian protective umbrella, was considered 
the main suspect. 
  When it became clear beyond any doubt, however, that the 
explosive on flight PA 103 was detonated by a simple timer, the 
investigations proceeded in a different direction. 
  Analyses conducted by the CIA led investigators to the 
actual manufacturer: the Zurich-based Mebo AG company. It 
trades in electronic appliances of all kinds. The timer was one 
of the company's own production lines, type MST-13, which was 
developed for the Libyans for use in desert warfare in 1985 and 
was resistant to dust and water. 
  According to what the CIA has established, a mechanism of 
this kind was used in the attack on the American Embassy in Togo 
in 1986. Two Libyans were arrested in Senegal in February 1988 
in connection with the attack: They had about 10 kg of plastic 
explosives and two MST-13 timers in their possession. The name 
of the manufacturing company had been removed, but using a 
special process, it was possible to make the name on the parts 
visible again: Mebo. 
  Almost two dozen units of this kind were produced, 
supposedly 
for al-Qadhdhafi's assistants. The fact that Mebo does 
substantial business with the Libyans was considered a very 
significant piece of evidence by the accusing parties. Mebo 
managers told the CIA as well as American and British Lockerbie 
investigators that the timers were sold solely to Tripoli and 
the Libyan People's Bureau in East Berlin. The charges against 
the two suspects depend very heavily on this statement. 
  However, the Mebo version turned out to be a smokescreen, 
perhaps even a false trail that had been deliberately laid. 
Edwin Bollier, 56, one of Mebo's two executive directors, 
apparently remembered just six months ago that he had had two 
other customers, from "the Institute for Technical Research or 
something similar in East Berlin," confided Bollier to 
investigators. 
  People of Bollier's kind might well have been familiar with 
the GDR Institute of Technical Research: It was a security 
service workshop for the production of all kinds of items of 
equipment used by agents: listening and detecting devices. 
  The investigators then believed that the Bollier had allowed 
himself to be bought by the Libyans -- anything is possible in 
the East -- and had made the statement to exonerate state 
terrorist al-Qadhdhafi. The Arabs had generously reimbursed his 
expenses. 
  The investigators also took careful note of the fact that in 
January, during the Geneva meeting between U.S. President 
Clinton and the Syrian head of state Hafiz al-Asad at the 
President Hotel, a colorful group turned up for a meeting: the 
four-man international Libyan defense team, including London 
lawyer Stephen M. Mitchell and American attorney Frank Rubino. 
  The spokesman for the group was the Libyan lawyer Ibrahim 
Legwell. Bollier also logically made his way to Geneva and 
revealed further details about the sale of Mebo timers to East 
Berlin. Mitchell said: "He always has something new to say." 
  The statements made by the Swiss electronics dealer, 
although 
they might continually vary, are essentially correct. 
  It has been clearly established that the Stasi acquired 
timers of the MST-13 type in 1985. The prosecution service 
assumes that Bollier had supplied the GDR with as many as seven 
units. At any rate, that is the quantity that appears in a Mebo 
bill that Bollier says that he suddenly found and has handed 
over to investigators as evidence. 
  In the meantime, former Stasi procurement employees are 
revealing that they had acquired "projector control devices of 
the MST-13 type." The following is an extract from the 
questioning of a former state security officer in Meckenheim: 
  Question: Did you buy the timer? 
  Answer: Yes, I did buy the timer; it was part of a package 
that also included two or three timers with digital displays and 
casings as well as about 10 units without casings. In addition, 
there was also an Italian reddish-brown attache case with a 
built-in transmitter that allowed two frequencies to be used for 
the detonation of explosives, using two receivers that were also 
supplied. We paid between DM30,000 and DM40,000. 
  Other Stasi employees have lent more credence to the German 
lead. On Thursday [14 April] of last week, a former MfS colonel 
who was being questioned by the BKA in Munich discussed the 
question. He ruled out direct and deliberate participation by 
his ministry in the Lockerbie bombing, but the witness went on 
to say that "that would by no means apply to passing on such a 
timer." 
  It has ultimately been proven that the MfS was involved in 
other murders. The latest example was provided last week: 
Stasi antiterrorism expert Helmut Voigt was sentenced to four 
years imprisonment for participation in the 1983 bombing of the 
Berlin Maison de France (one dead, 22 injured) by virtue of 
having passed on explosives used in the attack. 
  The current theory of sole Libyan involvement, although it 
might fit in very well with the Americans jumbled scheme of 
world politics, has been shattered. It is just as if the 
indictment had been written in invisible ink and the letters 
have now just suddenly disappeared. 
  Lockerbie and the German lead lead directly to the bizarre 
world of secret services, for which deception and subterfuge are 
the elixir of life. The Zurich Mebo boss Edwin Bollier, a 
sinister figure possessed of many talents, fits precisely into 
this picture. He has been playing a game on at least two sides. 
  While those leveling the charges place him firmly on the 
Libyan side, he was secretly involved in procurement for the GDR 
above all: He was a Stasi Unofficial Agent (IM) codenamed 
"Rubin" and procured highly sensitive goods over decades. At 
the MfS, he was registered under filename 2550/70 and there are 
six thick files chronicling his successes. 
  The papers on this gem among embargo busters, who procure 
forbidden goods worldwide and use cunning means to have those 
goods smuggled to recipient countries, were -- what a surprise 
-- destroyed during the confusion of the 1989 and 1990 
changeover. Bollier was to have begun the new era without being 
incriminated in any way. 
  The Swiss businessman has been behaving as if he knew 
nothing 
at all. He claims that he first learned from SPIEGEL "that I 
had been assigned a codename. All the business I conducted was 
concluded under my official name or official company names." 
  He had sworn dedication to the Libyans, but was not 
selective 
in seeking other employers if they had the money to throw 
around. Bollier, the servant of many masters, was not committed 
to any country or political conviction, but only to himself: 
Business with the east promised piles of loot, especially at 
the high point of the Cold War. 
  It is in keeping with Bollier's character that he did not 
have to be recruited like a common spy, but offered his services 
to the Stasi. At that time, at the end of the 1960's, there was 
great demand for electronic equipment on the part of the GDR. 
In Erich Mielke's Ministry of State Security, a special unit -- 
Department III -- had just been created to listen in on West 
German telephone communications. 
  Bollier had dinner at the "Stadt Berlin" Interhotel with 
department chief Horst Maennchen. The two, each of whom was a 
specialist in his own field, soon agreed on business. 
  The Swiss supplied special aerials, coders, police 
communications systems, and computer terminals. Maennchen's 
department took everything. More and more employees had to be 
supplied with technology, and in the end, the Stasi employed 
over 3,000 people in the interception of telephone 
communications. 
  IM Rubin traveled to the GDR almost every month. To report 
his arrival, Bollier just had to dial the East Berlin telephone 
number 5 59 49 48: This special line that had been set up for 
him ended on the desk of his officer in the Foreign Operatives 
Department. 
  There were no passport or customs controls for Bollier. 
During conversations at a Stasi villa in the Berlin embassy 
quarter of Pankow, order lists were checked off and new orders 
placed. The MfS paid cash, Western marks. A former Stasis 
officer says that "Bollier earned over 1 million marks from us." 
He would also come up with equipment, the procurement of which 
almost seemed impossible. When the KGB was pressurizing the 
fraternal East German secret service to acquire encrypting 
machines produced by the Swiss Crypto AG company, IM Rubin 
promptly carried out the job for a fee of DM120,000. 
  The Swiss firm also had excellent contacts with Western 
services: Bollier was able to obtain highly secret equipment 
using various complex ways and means. Thus, he supplied the 
Main Intelligence Administration, Stasi General Markus Wolf's 
team of spies, with a well-guarded American secret: the "Mark" 
voice analysis machine. 
  The appliance is similar to a lie detector and registers the 
slightest changes in a voice. Wolf wanted to use it to test the 
honesty of his agents. 
  GDR secret service officers became suspicious that the Swiss 
only needed weeks to acquire such sought after espionage 
equipment from the United States. Thus, Wolf's spies were to 
find out for whom Bollier really worked. 
  The attempt failed. Bollier traveled constantly and could 
not be shadowed well enough. A former Stasi officer told German 
investigators that "it was not possible to obtain tangible 
results in view of the enormous amount of travel that Bollier 
conducted." 
  The MfS was not sure: Bollier might also be working for a 
Western secret service, "probably the CIA," is what an internal 
report stated. After they had had dinner together, the 
assessment of IM Rubin arrived at by Colonel Gerhard Hoeferer, 
Maennchen's deputy, was: "He is a double agent." 
  Should a smart multiple agent, who, grotesquely enough, was 
also on the CIA payroll, be finally responsible for the cruel 
death of the mainly American Pan Am passengers? As a 
precaution, the Frankfurt state prosecutor investigated 
"relevant connections" at the Federal Intelligence Service [BND] 
in March -- the answer is still pending. A Stasi defector, 
which the BND released to the Lockerbie investigators, affirmed 
to the BKA officers: "A man like Bollier had hidden protectors 
in the West." Asked aobut CIA contacts, Bollier told DER 
SPIEGEL: "No comment." 
  In the bizarre artificial world of agents and misinformers, 
such entanglements are part of the risks that every principal 
incurs. Nobody trusts anybody, everybody spies on everybody 
else, and traitors buy traitors who give away traitors. 
  So it may happen quite easily that a major affair goes wrong 
and that those who should actually have been protected are 
damaged. 
  Should Bollier have reported to other -- maybe even western 
-- masters about his dealings with the bad guy number one, 
al-Qadhdhafi? Or should he have assisted the Stasi in what was 
its declared policy at the time, namely to protect the GDR 
against international terrorist attacks -- through cooperation 
with internationally acting terrorist groups? 
  A former Stasi man, who in 1983 became IM Rubin's 
controller, 
might be able to provide information on Bollier's dealings with 
Mielke's men. To the Swiss informer, he introduced himself as 
Joachim Wenzel. 
  A brilliant technician, radio mechanic, and an information 
technology engineer by profession, he was entrusted with unusual 
tasks by the MfS at an early stage: Wenzel built the electronic 
timing device for a bomb, which was to be placed underneath a 
car of a Hamburg refugee smuggler. 
  The former officer has meanwhile been interrogated half a 
dozen times by the BKA. The question and answer game has almost 
become a ritual. Here is the excerpt from one interrogation on 
the timer in the Lockerbie bomb: 
  BKA: Mr. Wenzel, I am showing you here a gray plastic case 
consisting of two pieces, what can you tell us about it? 
  Wenzel: This case is of exactly the same design as those 
used by Mr. Bollier for the clocks he sold us. 
  BKA: When was this version with the control wheels provided 
by Bollier? 
  Wenzel: I am pretty sure that this control clock is the last 
of a series of versions and was presented to us by him between 
March and June 1985. 
  BKA: Has Bollier made any comment toward you in connection 
with the attack against Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie? 
  Wenzel: No, not once. 
  In a statement dictated to the investigators, Wenzel said 
that, at the MfS, the higher ranks were greatly worried at the 
time that Bollier might have "sold" the timers to "other groups, 
too." The Stasi man: "I was mainly thinking of terrorist 
circles such as the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty], the 
IRA, the RAF [Red Army Faction], and maybe even the Libyans." 
What is certain is that in 1987, Wenzel took the timers, which 
Bollier had provided, along with him to his new department on 
Ferdinand-Schultze street. There, he worked in the Main 
Department XXII: It was responsible for antiterrorist 
activities and had closest contacts with militant Arab groups, 
but also the West German RAF. 
  The timers have disappeared since then. It is unclear 
whether they were destroyed in the chaos before and after 1989, 
when the Stasi destroyed technological equipment from bugging 
devices to shredders, or whether, still under the responsibility 
of Mielke and Erich Honecker, the timers found their fateful 
destination in the world of international terrorism. 
  There was no shortage of potential buyers. Explosive 
solidarity presents were regarded by Stasi as helpful for 
initiating good relations with all kinds of Arabic terrorist 
groups. A network with many spiders. 
  The Stasi, for example, provided ship loads of lethal 
material to the security department of the PLO, 5,000 hand 
grenades, explosives, 1,000 detonators, and bridging timers 
[Brueckenzuender] in 1980 alone. 
  Yet, even the many splinter groups of the Palestinian 
movement, who plagued the world with murderous terrorist attacks 
for 20 years, found a new base in the GDR. 
  Leading representatives of international gangs frequently 
came to East Berlin. The internationally wanted terrorist 
Carlos, who, according to recent intelligence reports continues 
to live in Damascus under Syrian protection, used to stay in the 
fine Palace Hotel Unter den Linden. The fighters of infamous 
Abu Nidal underwent a three-month training course at the MfS in 
1985, including the launching of missiles and shells. Only a 
few months after the training, the group slaughtered 16 people 
at Rome airport and four at Vienna airport. 
  Abu Dawud, who is believed to be one of the men responsible 
for the massacre at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, was also 
attracted by East Berlin. In the 80's, the former terrorist 
resided in the very center of Berlin, at 178 Prenzlauer Allee. 
  The East German intelligence service got more and more 
deeply 
involved in its insidious cooperation with the Arab guerrillas 
-- after all, they were fighting the same enemy. 
  Over whom did the Stasi hold out protective hands, who is 
behind Lockerbie? Was it the Iranians, after all, who wanted to 
take revenge for the unintentional downing of an Airbus by the 
American destroyer Vincennes in 1988 above the Strait of Hormuz? 
And were they assisted by the Syrians, who are meanwhile high 
in the favor of the Americans after they stood up against Iraq's 
Saddam Husayn in the Gulf war? 
  The intelligence experts now must go through a new mass of 
theories of conspiracy. The Russian intelligence service, for 
example, is by no means convinced about the American 
investigations according to which Libya alone was responsible. 
  The CIA's most important source was "tapped rumblings of the 
Arabs," as one Russian intelligence service officer said. The 
Americans did not even use the "confidential communications 
channel," which was set up in 1990, to ask Moscow for 
information. 
  And such information would be abundant in a place where the 
archivists of international intelligence service connections on 
Stasi and Arabs, on terrorists and agents, have accumulated 
unique information. Leonid Shebarshin, former head of the 
Soviet foreign intelligence service, was surprised at 
Washington's silence: "They have not asked a single question."

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Do We Need 
Vigilante Groups, Mr. Kanther?"] 
  [Text] [BILD] Minister, did you get back the car radio 
that was stolen from you? 
  [Kanther] No, the thieves have not been identified yet. 
  [BILD] The crime situation is deteriorating in Germany -- do 
you still walk around without fear? 
  [Kanther] I feel safe. Yet, I do understand the concern of 
many citizens in view of the rising crime rate. It is the 
responsibility of the state to free citizens of this subjective 
threat. This is why I have initiated the anticrime law. 
  [BILD] What do you think of the idea of citizens taking care 
of their protection themselves? 
  [Kanther] Nothing. We do not need vigilante groups with 
armbands and wielding sticks. This does not create security. 
Another question is the increased use of volunteer police 
assistants. Qualified private security enterprises can also do 
good service, for example in the protection of buildings. 
  [BILD] What sort of work might the volunteer assistants be 
asked to do? 
  [Kanther] Pensioners could be called back from retirement to 
help do clerical work. I can even imagine volunteer officers 
driving patrol cars. This would release more officers for real 
police tasks. 
  [BILD] Why are you called the "black sheriff?" 
  [Kanther] Honestly, I do not care what people call me. 
However, if this label is intended to mean that I am a firm 
supporter of law and order, then I have nothing against it.

<F P=106> ["wg" report: "Is Schoenhuber Covering Violent Criminals?"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin/Dresden -- Is Republikaner Chairman Franz 
Schoenhuber covering the men who attacked a refugee hostel in 
Bergheim-Zieverich on 6 October 1991? According to the latest 
press reports, not only the chief but also leading functionaries 
of the North Rhine-Westphalian land association were involved 
"in crimes and the covering up of crimes." 
  The reports are based, among other things, on a 
comprehensive 
dossier from the Duesseldorf Interior Ministry. According to 
it, several documents seized from Republikaners prove that the 
right-wing extremists "discussed" behind closed doors "the 
potential origin, accomplices, or prevention of the 
clarification of crimes." One North Rhine-Westphalian 
functionary, among others, is suspected of having planned and, 
together with others, carried out the arson attack in 
Bergheim-Zieverich. In addition, the dossier reportedly also 
contains indications of further "readiness for violence" of the 
right-wing extremists. These include one "mock execution" by 
two members of the Muehlheim district Republikaner, which caused 
the death of a Turk with a heart condition. 
  Schoenhuber, Mr. Clean, is getting into a dubious light 
because, like the land association, he reportedly knew about the 
events in North Rhine-Westphalia, but did not do anything about 
it. TAGESSPIEGEL bases its report on a former member of the 
Republikaner, who claims to have sent corresponding minutes to 
Schoenhuber and repeatedly phoned Schoenhuber's office, calling 
on the party chairman to expel the accused party colleague and 
contact the police. Schoenhuber denies it. 
  Schoenhuber's attempt to present his party as extreme right 
wing but still conforming to the Constitution and to separate it 
from those rightist parties that are clearly hostile to the 
Constitution threatens to fail in other respects, too. Not only 
parts of the German People's Union (DVU), but also the neo-Nazis 
of the National List (NL) are calling for active election 
support for the Republikaner. Says an NL strategy paper: "If 
Schoenhuber gets about 30 deputies into the Bundestag with 
perhaps 5 percent, there will be some `deviants from the right' 
among them. Having only one single (autonomous) 
ultra-radical-nationalist deputy there would be a similar 
advantage for the `National Opposition' as Christian Democratic 
Union Deputy Krause, who has changed over to the Republikaner." 
  In Saxony the Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
now uses intelligence service means to monitor the Republikaner 
and has noticed that leading Republikaner cooperate with 
neo-Nazis. This was announced by CDU Interior Minister Eggert 
on Wednesday [13 April]. Nine of the 16 laender are now using 
intelligence service means against the Republikaner.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Dieter Schroeder </F>
and Martin E. Sueskind; place and date not given: "I Am 
Rendering Massive Election Assistance in Bavaria"] 
  [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You fasted and meditated over 
Easter, Mr. Chancellor. How many pounds did you lose, and how 
fit do you feel for the contest in the coming months? 
  [Kohl] I lost the same amount of weight as I do every year: 
17 pounds. I believe in fasting, because fasting does not 
primarily mean losing weight. It mainly means developing a 
clear head. I did this out of religious convictions. I feel in 
to condition. I am ready to fight. I was already sure earlier 
on that I would win the Bundestag election, and now I am even 
more sure. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Also because Mr. Kinkel has issued a 
coalition statement to your advantage? Is that the FDP's 
[Freedom Democratic Party] final answer to a social-liberal 
coalition? 
  [Kohl] I have no doubts at all that the CDU/CSU [Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and FDP coalition will 
gain a majority in the October Bundestag election. I consider 
the idea that the great people's parties are crumbling 
ridiculous. They are not crumbling in the wings, nor will the 
voters stay at home en masse. We will once again have an 
excellent election turnout, i.e. about 80 percent. I am not 
worried about the FDP. There is an occasional tendency to sound 
death-knells for the FDP. But clever people inside the FDP know 
that this is only to their advantage, because Germany needs a 
party like that. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the presidential elections, 
differences of opinion inside the FDP could cause a loss of 
Liberal votes for the Union candidate Roman Herzog. Do you see 
such a danger? 
  [Kohl] No, I do not. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you take a look at the other 
partner, the CSU, which is having trouble carrying on its own 
past that is stamped with the personality of Franz-Josef 
Strauss, is there no danger to your election victory? 
  [Kohl] It is true that the CSU is having difficulty with 
this 
matter right now. That the problem has arisen just now is no 
coincidence, but deliberate, and has something to do with the 
Landtag and Bundestag elections. I see a good chance of the CSU 
winning both the Landtag and Bundestag elections. As far as 
Franz-Josef Strauss is concerned, I am better qualified to speak 
out than most of the others. There is hardly anyone who has had 
more arguments with him than me. There is no denying, however, 
that Franz-Josef Strauss was one of the greatest and most 
impressive figures in German postwar politics, and that he, 
together with other figures such as Alfons Goppel, made a 
decisive contribution to the reconstruction of modern Bavaria as 
one of the leading laender. I know better than many others that 
Strauss had many facets. I find it terrible that many people 
are dissociating themselves from Strauss now that he is dead. 
When he was alive, they just could not get close enough to him. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How many voters must the CSU have in 
Bavaria for you to succeed in Bonn? 
  [Kohl] I have never attached much importance to arithmetical 
sums. I tell you, we the coalition will attain a sufficient 
majority in the Bundestag election. I have no doubt at all 
about that. In any case, you must not forget that the joint 
CDU-CSU chancellor is a good candidate for the Bavarians. As a 
man of the Palatinate, I myself am a born Bavarian. My father 
was a Frank. I am going to render massive election assistance 
in Bavaria. I am quite sure that we have good changes again 
there. And when the Bavarians are faced with the choice of 
either Rudolf Scharping or Helmut Kohl, I do not think they will 
need a long time to decide who is closer to them. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But you and your party do not appear 
to be winners in the opinion polls. 
  [Kohl] I do not think much of the opinion polls these days. 
It is tomorrow's results that count, primarily the election 
results themselves, of course. People are only just beginning 
to make comparisons. Mr. Scharping has only been prime minister 
in Mainz since 1991. He has never faced the need to make 
difficult and frequently unpopular decisions. In 1991, the 
earlier weaknesses of the CDU in Rhineland-Palatinate made it 
easy for him to win the Landtag election. He has realized the 
need to throw his internal party rivals out of the race. That 
is his greatest achievement so far. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] That alone is something. 
  [Kohl] Agreed. I appreciate people who know how to use 
power. But it is quite a different thing to retain power at the 
top, and I should know, because I have been doing it for over 
two decades. I take things as they come. I am trying to do my 
duty. Herr Scharping is doing his And then the voters will 
decide. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If you run in Bavaria, you will also 
have dealings with the Republikaner. What if the CSU fails to 
achieve an absolute majority? 
  [Kohl] Who told you the Republikaner will win? They need 5 
percent of the votes in the Bundestag election. And it is not 
so easy to get 5 percent out of 80 million Germans and a 80 
percent election turnout. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But what if they do succeed? 
  [Kohl] Why should I talk about that? I tell you they will 
not win. The huge majority of Germans know very well that every 
vote cast for the Republikaner is a vote against internal 
stability and our country's foreign image. Apart from that, 
most voters know that we cannot afford a red-green experiment. 
That would endanger our country's future potential. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Protest voters might not worry about 
that. 
  [Kohl] People find it easier to cast protest votes at a 
Landtag election because it carried less risk than a Bundestag 
election. But I consider it wrong to underestimate Landtag 
elections. The September Landtag election is very important for 
Bavaria. At the Bundestag elections, the voter knows that the 
future of the entire country is at stake. We will fight the 
Republikaner without compunction, but we will not rebuke those 
who voted for them, because only a few of these voters were 
right-wing radicals. We want to win back as many protest voters 
as possible. I see a good chance of chance of that. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Chancellor, the current debate 
has reached the following question: Should one fight the 
Republikaner with special laws, such as a law against the 
"Auschwitz lie," or perhaps by banning the party altogether? 
  [Kohl] Those are two different things. I consider a party 
ban out of the question, and I wish to make it clear that I 
would not do such a thing. A political party must be fought 
with political-intellectual resources. As far as legislation is 
concerned, for example the "Auschwitz lie," then I am not quite 
sure. The "Auschwitz lie" is already punishable, but only legal 
loopholes are being discussed. But that is completely different 
from banning a party, let me make that quite clear. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us get back to Bavaria. If you 
put up a strong presence there, how will you handle the 
difference of opinion with Prime Minister Stoiber on the subject 
of European policy? Can this differences simply be ironed out? 
  [Kohl] I have nothing to iron out. The CDU and its chairman 
have been in favor of a continuity of European policy ever since 
Konrad Adenauer. But I have also learned something more. We 
adopted the term "United States of Europe" from Winston 
Churchill. But that never meant a European duplication of the 
United States of America. I discovered that in the minds of the 
citizens, association with Europe was something completely 
different; not just in Germany, but all over Europe. Therefore 
I no longer use the term "United States of Europe." Each one 
of us is rooted to his own home territory -- you in Bavaria, and 
I in the Palatinate. We remain Germans, Frenchmen, or Italians. 
And at the same time we are Europeans. I have no problems 
about that when, for example, Edmund Stoiber or the CSU 
emphasize the topic of subsidiarity. I am open to that. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But Finance Minister Waigel gets 
quite upset about the subject of Europe. He is worried about 
our growing contributions to the EC budget. Can this be an 
election topic for the 12 June European elections or later? You 
are accused of having been too generous in Maastricht. 
  [Kohl] Never. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Can this turn into an issue? 
  [Kohl] Of course it can. We need European unity, the EU, 
mainly for two reasons. For me, the decisive question is how we 
can guarantee peace and freedom in Europe, and therefore in 
Germany also in the future. I am convinced this is only 
possible as a member of the EU. We all see the horror pictures 
from ex-Yugoslavia, where hatred, murder, and homelesssness are 
on the daily agenda. The evil ghosts of the past are at home 
not only in the Balkans. They can also emerge in other parts of 
Europe. We must take early action against this. Only European 
unity can guarantee peace for good. In second place, I would 
put the economy. We Germans have the greatest economic 
advantage to gain from European unity. When the EEC was founded 
in 1957, German exports worth 14 billion marks went to the 12 
countries that make up the EU today. In 1992 we exported a good 
360 million marks worth of goods to these countries. Therefore 
our exports to the EU countries have risen as sharply as our 
exports to the rest of the world. We owe many million jobs to 
the close economic ties with our European partners. One quarter 
of the jobs in Germany are dependent on these ties. As you see, 
Europe is no luxury for Germany, but a vital necessity. 
Therefore it is short- sighted to complain that we make the 
heaviest contributions to the EU budget. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What does Waigel say when you tell 
him that? 
  [Kohl] Theo Waigel agrees. However, it is true that we have 
now reached our financial limits. That also applies to our aid 
to Central and East European countries. Germany is not a hen 
that keeps laying golden eggs. We must see to it that other 
countries also make their contribution, and we must bear in mind 
that the present distribution of burdens within the EU -- I am 
not talking about the poorer countries like Ireland or Portugal 
-- is not in order. There are some things that have to be 
checked, and we will also do so. But that does not alter the 
fact that we are paying the most and that we have the most 
advantages. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us remain on the subject of the 
economy. You have often referred to the "boom" trends here, but 
are these trends not too weak, and are they not appearing too 
late to be of advantage to you on election day? 
  [Kohl] I am not a prophet. All I know is that it is the 
economic institutes that are again using the term "boom" these 
days, not me. I can see that exports are clearly increasing in 
some areas. I think the signs show an improvement and that the 
economic path has been set correctly. Wise tariff agreements 
have been concluded, and we are achieving a good overall 
climate. It is obvious that we are emerging from the depths of 
the recession and that the German economy is once again moving 
ahead. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You see optimistic signs, but your 
coalition partner has already announced changes to your concept. 
The FDP is suggesting a limitation to the solidarity-supplement 
on income tax. 
  [Kohl] I do not consider such thoughts. I have told the 
voters clearly -- we need the money for a few more years in 
order to encourage the economic and social growth in the new 
laender. By the way, the capital we are investing there will be 
repaid with interest, for we are investing in the future of the 
whole of Germany. Flourishing landscapes -- I have been 
insulted and ridiculed for a long time because of this term -- 
are arising. We will abolish the tax supplement as soon as a 
good control over ther budget permits us to do so. But I will 
not say when that will happen. There is something else that I 
will not say even after the elections. I am not going to repeat 
a mistake I once made. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The mistake was to allow the FDP to 
commit you to a one-year limitation of the income tax supplement 
that was introduced at that time? 
  [Kohl] Yes. Needless to say, the faster we get this 
business going, the better. I am not keen on tax increases. I 
am a keen supporter of a social market economy, which cannot be 
made to suffer as far as services are concerned, but must be 
profitable for society's sake. Between 1982 and 1989, we 
reduced state involvement in the economy from over 50 percent to 
under 46 percent. For reasons that are generally known, we now 
have to increase this involvement to 52 percent. But I want to 
reduce it to its 1989 level as soon as possible. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you talk of a comprehensible tax 
policy, then you must explain what you meant when you said in 
your television interview that additional funds are required in 
order to tidy up traffic policy. What does that mean? Will 
there be an increase in the tax on crude oil? 
  [Kohl] We need cars and railroads. The congestion on our 
roads is increasing in line with prosperity, and there is no 
solution to the problem right now. We need a sensible 
combination of rail and road. An overall concept is required 
for this purpose, and we are working on such a concept right 
now. We must make the railroad competitive. But I am very much 
against outlawing road traffic by means of red-green ideology. 
There is too much shouting going on. Demonstrations against 
road traffic are held, yet people travel to these demonstrations 
in their own cars! For many people, cars are a part of their 
well-earned freedom. We need a concept that combines road, 
rail, and water in a sensible manner. Naturally, we will have to 
meet the costs of such a concept. We need more funds for 
traffic policy. We will make the appropriate suggestions in our 
election program, whereby both the economic and the ecological 
aspects of the matter have to be considered. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The SPD is taking the CDU's place in 
many spheres -- in internal security, for example -- and it is 
acting as if it were a better version of the CDU and as if 
nothing is possible without it. How do you intend to break this 
stranglehold? 
  [Kohl]. Easy. I will tell the people that nothing is right 
in the front and in the rear. What makes the SPD a better 
version of the CDU? I see nothing. The Social Democrats will 
try to appear like the CDU, but one can see the difference. 
Remember how long it took the SPD to finally agree on the new 
asylum law. Our country would have been spared many problems if 
the SPD had not delayed the issue for such a long time. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If you are planning a massive 
election campaign in Bavaria, you must be able to afford a 
massive campaign in the new laender as well. 
  [Kohl] Yes, of course. In the new laender I will take up 
all the major positions that I occupied in 1990. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But the CDU does not have a good 
reputation in eastern Germany right now. 
  [Kohl] We will see during the elections. When I look at the 
latest opinion polls in the new laender, I can see that people's 
conviction about the economic and social success of German unity 
is becoming clearer from one day to the next; 67 percent of 
respondents there have said the economic upturn is reaching the 
east, and 59 percent claim that their personal situation has 
improved as a result of German unity. Only 21 percent say that 
they are in a worse situation than they were before unity. At 
the end of 1990, 34 percent said they could afford to buy more 
than they could under the GDR. In 1991, 39 percent said so, and 
today 47 percent are saying so. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But people do not seem to be thanking 
you for it. 
  [Kohl] When I look at these figures and consider my own 
personal experience, then all I can say is that one must talk to 
people. Of course the wind is blowing back in our faces right 
now, and of course some people are shamelessly stirring up 
emotions, for example Mrs. Hildebrandt, the social minister of 
Brandenburg. In the eastern part of the country, I will speak 
to the people on the same streets and in the same squares that I 
spoke to them in 1990, and other places besides. I will tell 
them: I promised you that together we would create flourishing 
landscapes in the reunited Germany. If I said this would happen 
four or five years into the future, I was mistaken. In 1990 I 
assumed that our trading partner the Soviet Union would continue 
to exist. No one imagined that just one year later the Soviet 
Union would collapse and that eastern trade would practically 
disintegrate. As recently as summer 1991 I spoke to Mikhail 
Gorbachev about supplies from the new laender worth 25 billion 
marks. Today we are happy if we deliver just 5 million marks 
worth of supplies with the help of Hermes [export credit] 
guarantees. As a result of all this, many jobs were lost in the 
new laender. The reconstruction will now take longer than 
expected, but it is already in full steam, and the emergence of 
"flourishing landscapes" can be seen in many places. I might 
have got the time scale wrong, but unlike my critics I have made 
my contribution to German unity, while others gave up and 
betrayed this objective a long time ago. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
visited you the day before yesterday. If the peace plan for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina takes shape, will Germany take part in a UN 
peace mission to implement it? 
  [Kohl] Let me tell you first of all that in a few weeks 
time, the Constitutional Court will decide whether such 
involvement is in keeping with the Basic Law. We await this 
decision. That is the first important thing. The second is -- 
of course we will help millions of suffering people in a ravaged 
land, and not stand aside. But that does not indicate the type 
and extent of our help. What are our German worries compared to 
the worries of the people who live there? One would have to 
have a heart of stone to say that their fate does not concern 
us. Therefore, we will offer assistance where needed, also 
because one cannot permit the Serbs and Croats to subdue the 
Muslims, who are the weaker group. We cannot just stand by and 
watch this happen. As for a military involvement, I am 
extremely skeptical. Memories of World War II are particularly 
vivid in that part of Europe. Therefore, one must ask to what 
extent German help is at all desirable, and what form it should 
assume. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] It could be a combination of the help 
already given in Cambodia and Somalia, in other words medical 
and technical aid. 
  [Kohl] But we are not in Cambodia or Somalia. We will have 
to quietly discuss the question of help. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us get back to the subject of 
Bosnia once again. Tension has arisen with Moscow on account of 
the NATO operations. Do you intend to mediate in this matter? 
  [Kohl] No. I do not like the term "mediation" in this 
context. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But you could telephone your friend 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Kohl] That is something else altogether. It is not 
mediation. Let me tell you something. Ever since unity, 
enormous expectations are being made of us Germans, and we are 
quite incapable of fulfilling some of them. Many people say 
that the Germans should help whenever something happens in the 
world. Today we have excellent relations with Washington, 
Moscow, Paris, and London, and we want to use them. But we must 
guard against assuming the role of mediator. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have had a dispute with your 
justice minister about the deportation of the Kurds. Has it 
been settled? 
  [Kohl] There was no dispute. My position on the deportation 
of the Kurds is well known. It conforms to the position of all 
members of the government. We are a law-governed country that 
respects human rights. We do not deport anyone who is 
threatened with a death sentence or torture. Because we are a 
law-governed country and because our country has to protect its 
internal peace, it is quite unacceptable for people who are 
guests in our country to intimidate or terrorize others, for 
whatever reason. I cannot accept an abuse of the right to 
demonstrate for the purposes of violence or street terror. He 
who adheres to our laws, as well as the rules governing aliens, 
is in no danger of being deported. We behave just like all 
civilized countries on earth. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The law applies to everyone equally. 
  [Kohl] No one in his right mind denies that. No one who has 
not violated the laws in this country is deported. By the way, 
the side-effects of such violent misdeeds have to be considered. 
We want to remain a county friendly to foreigners, a country 
open to the world. That is essential for our future. If we 
permit such occurrences, no wonder people complain. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The last question, Mr. Chancellor. 
What do you tell voters who ask why Helmut Kohl should run in 
elections for the fourth time after 12 years in office? 
  [Kohl] There are two major reasons. In the time that I have 
at my disposal, I want to achieve as much progress as possible 
concerning Germany's internal unity and, concerning European 
unity, to do everything I can to prevent a regression, so that 
we may never experience developments we thought belonged to the 
past, for example the European civil wars that are again taking 
place in front of our door in the Balkans. Guaranteeing peace 
and freedom for us and future generations is the most important 
thing for me. For 49 years we have had the fortune to live in 
peace. But that does not mean that peace and freedom are 
granted once and for all. Peace and freedom are no simple gift 
from heaven. We have to do something for them. We need a 
united Germany in a united Europe. I want to continue to work 
on that.

<F P=106> ["deu" report: "Scharping in New York: Schaeuble </F>
Purposefully Slandered the SPD in the United States"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping has accused Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag Group Chairman 
Wolfgang Scharping of slandering the Social Democrats to the 
U.S. leadership and of "laying fuses." He had to notice this 
again and again in his talks with high-ranking U.S. politicians, 
Scharping said at the conclusion of his one-week visit to the 
United States in New York on the weekend [16-17 April]. 
Schaeuble had been in the United States for a similar public 
relations trip 14 days before Scharping. "Anyone who slanders a 
domestic policy opponent abroad acts irresponsibly" and damages 
Germany's reputation, the SPD chief said. The fear of a change 
in government is "no justification for purposefully launching 
misinterpretations about political opponents." 
  Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that his interlocutors 
in 
the U.S. Administration and in Congress repeatedly asked him 
about the SPD's attitude toward NATO. When he explained, the 
Americans were often surprised and said that just recently 
Schaeuble had told them something completely different. The 
CDU/CSU Bundestag group chairman also claimed in the United 
States that the Free Democratic Party of Germany will in any 
case be at the side of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag election 
campaign and afterward. Therefore, the SPD is only left with an 
alliance with the Greens, who have the dissolution of NATO and 
the abolition of the Bundeswehr in their program. 
  In an interview with U.S. journalists, Schaeuble had deduced 
from these ideas: "As an American I would decide in favor of 
our coalition, because it is more reliable." In addition, 
Schaeuble stressed "profound differences" in foreign policy 
between the Federal Government and the SPD, even though 
Scharping gives assurances of the opposite. Schaeuble added: 
"I am not sure whether Scharping might not actually share our 
position, but he cannot push it through in his party."

<F P=106> [Interview with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio by Nino </F>
Sunseri in Milan on 17 April: "A Broader Majority and New Rules 
in the Senate"] 
  [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Sunseri] Mr. Speaker, 
you will now have to take part in and, above all, umpire rather 
more complicated "matches" than a soccer game. Your own 
election, for example, was a complex contest, do you agree? 
  [Scognamiglio] I believe that two lessons can be drawn from 
the uncertainty surrounding my election as speaker of the 
Senate. One is political in nature, and the other technical. 
These are serious issues that must be tackled and solved. 
  [Sunseri] Let us start from the first. Which is the 
political issue? 
  [Scognamiglio] The political problem is no doubt linked to 
the majority's enlargement. It seems obvious to me that the 
existing majority is too puny, at least in the Senate, to enable 
the country to be governed acceptably. I am concerned about 
what may happen when important laws, such as the finance bill or 
the budget, have to be passed. There is the risk that the 
legislative system may become paralyzed, which would certainly 
not do Italy any good. 
  [Sunseri] Do you have any proposals to make concerning the 
enlargement of the majority? 
  [Scognamiglio] It is not up to me to make any operational 
proposals. It is a task for politicians, and I am not a 
politician but a professor. I have now been elected Senate 
speaker, and it is my duty to make it function properly. 
However, I believe that reaching broader agreements is 
essential to avoid the danger of paralysis. 
  [Sunseri] However, your own appointment, which was secured 
in 
such an aggressive fashion, certainly does not help in seeking 
broader agreements, do you not agree? 
  [Scognamiglio] What you are saying does not seem very 
accurate to me. My election was not secured by forcing the 
situation, but rather, it resulted from an act of clarity. A 
candidacy was submitted, and then consensus was sought. The 
candidacy obtained the necessary support, and was therefore 
approved. I find nothing abnormal in such a procedure. 
  [Sunseri] But how do you feel being the speaker of a house 
which is split down the middle, and in which your name prevailed 
only by a single vote? 
  [Scognamiglio] I feel fine. I will be the speaker for all 
the senators, not only of those who voted for me. I think 
calling me only a half-speaker does not do justice to the real 
situation. A vote was taken, and this led to a result. 
Everything took place by the book, and it is pointless to dwell 
on whether the majority was achieved by one vote or one hundred. 
We must now forget this. I feel I represent all the senators, 
and that it is my task to ensure that the assembly can function 
fully. 
  [Sunseri] However, without a majority it will be difficult. 
  [Scognamiglio] Of course. This is why I favor seeking new 
alliances. This, however, is not my task. My duty is to 
safeguard the institution. Politicians must muster the 
necessary consensus to ensure that the country can be governed. 
  [Sunseri] Earlier on, apart from the political aspect, you 
were mentioning a technical problem. Does the Bocconi [Milan 
University] professor intend to apply his theories to the 
government institutions? 
  [Scognamiglio] The problem is very simple. The Senate's 
organization was set up on the basis of the old proportional 
law. Now it has been elected through a majority system. 
Clearly, changes must be introduced to take account of this 
fundamental difference. Once upon a time, agreements were 
reached behind closed doors, which today, however, must be 
opened. I am committed to this goal, and will not pursue it 
alone. I will seek agreement with all other collegiate bodies.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Marco Ventura in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `The Renewal 
Process Must Not Be Stopped'" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- "Let us be honest. [Former Senate 
speaker] Spadolini really asked for it. He was pathetic when he 
said that he lost because the others, and not he, presented his 
candidacy. He was a joke." [passage omitted] Fini is 
certainly happy about the election of Carlo Scognamiglio of 
Forza Italia and Irene Pivetti of the Northern League as Senate 
and lower house speakers. "We will continue in this way, we 
have buried the Cencelli manual [power-sharing system]." 
  [Ventura] The adversaries are accusing you of being arrogant 
and of wanting to take everything. 
  [Fini] Please, this is ridiculous. These statements are 
being made by those who have nothing to say. A great many 
people in Italy disliked clubby politics: Now that this 
terrible custom of the First Republic has finally ended, here 
they are shouting out. 
  [Ventura] Why do you say that Spadolini was asking for it? 
  [Fini] His position was a very respectable one as long as he 
said that he was only available as an institutional candidate. 
I said that we did not have the majority in the Senate. 
However, when I had evidence that Spadolini was the candidate 
supported by [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto 
and [outgoing Interior Minister] Mancino, and that the 
institutional cover was only an alibi to cover those who had 
been defeated at the elections, I no longer had any doubts. 
  [Ventura] Spadolini said on the spur of the moment: "The new 
government reminds me of `Giovinezza, Giovinezza'" [fascist 
song]. 
  [Fini] This is an hysterical reaction; he lost his temper. 
  [Ventura] Yet things will not be easy for this government in 
the Senate. 
  [Fini] We know this. At the beginning many foresaw that 
there would be irreconcilable differences among us, Forza 
Italia, Northern League, and the CCD [Christian Democratic 
Center]. Instead we demonstrated our power of cohesion: 
Scognamiglio got all the majority votes, all "my" 
parliamentarians voted for a Northern League candidate in the 
lower house and for a Forza Italia candidate in the Senate. And 
since eight out of nine life members of the Senate voted for 
Spadolini, at the Senate we got eight votes that were not from 
our people. 
  [Ventura] What about the future? [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi has "opened" to the center. 
  [Fini] This was agreed upon with [Northern League Secretary] 
Bossi and myself. There is a problem of numbers in the Senate, 
there is no use denying this. However, this opening will take 
place on the basis of our program and certainly not immediately 
with the vote of confidence. The government will have to 
promote a possible widening of the majority with policies that 
are judged positively in certain circles of the center, 
especially on the topic of solidarity. 
  [Ventura] Will the center go along? 
  [Fini] The center is weak. Its opposition will inevitably be 
sucked up by the progressives. There are already two lines of 
thought inside the meager Italian Popular Party [PPI]-Pact for 
Italy unit: Not all of them are willing to follow [PPI Veneto 
regional secretary] Bindi and [PPI Sicily regional secretary] 
Mattarella. I am very optimistic, as long as the center does 
not fool itself by thinking that it can stop the renewal and 
clean-up process. 
  [Ventura] Even the Left demonstrated itself to be compact. 
  [Fini] A possible arithmetical majority against the 
government in the Senate will never be a "political" majority: 
Left and Center would have to join forces but they would never 
make it in the lower house. There is no alternative. The 
opposition will have to take on the responsibility of making 
Italy ungovernable, while the Italians want a government. 
  [Ventura] Scognamiglio in the Senate, Pivetti in the lower 
house. When will it be the turn of National Alliance? 
  [Fini] One minute after the closure of the voting booths, I 
had already said that we would not make the issue of candidates 
a problem: We wanted to facilitate matters for the alliance, 
not hamper them. When the government is formed we will be 
there, actively. 
  [Ventura] It seems that the deputy speakers will also be 
from 
the Northern League. 
  [Fini] In meetings with Bossi and Berlusconi, we never said: 
You take the lower house, I will take the Senate, then at 
Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office] For the first time the 
two speakers have been elected without considering parliamentary 
seats as pawns to be moved on a larger chessboard that also 
includes the ministries. 
  [Ventura] You have been accused of trading votes, of having 
divided the seats among yourselves. 
  [Fini] Trading, nothing of the kind! These people do not 
understand that things have really changed. Moreover, I am 
convinced that, while we all will obviously have to work on the 
program, the choice of the prime minister instead will fall on 
the president and therefore we will put an end to the old power 
sharing system. 
  [Ventura] Will the opposition also remain out of the rest? 
How will it be guaranteed? 
  [Fini] The lower house regulations apportion two deputy 
speakers to the opposition. There are mechanisms of this kind 
in other sectors. The men that we will choose for the 
institutional tasks will be experts. As for the "rest" we will 
see. 
  [Ventura] What about the president of the Republic? Some 
from the Northern League are pushing for [President] Scalfaro's 
resignation. 
  [Fini] At the moment, the current head of state is a 
guarantee and not an element of confusion: It is neither 
opportune nor necessary to question this. 
  [Ventura] A controversial 25 April [Liberation Day] is 
drawing near. Scalfaro is calling for national reconciliation. 
  [Fini] I hope that he keeps the well-balanced positions that 
he held some days ago; I viewed this very positively, just as I 
considered the behavior of Interior Minister Mancino to be very 
serious: Mancino did not give a damn about the country when he 
resigned in an emergency situation that can be difficult. There 
are those who see 25 April as a revenge for what happened on 27 
March [election day] not for what happened on 25 April 50 years 
ago. 
  [Ventura] Are you afraid of the people even after 25 April? 
  [Fini] A part of the Left -- I am referring to the CGIL 
[Italian General Confederation of Labor] and the COBAS 
[rank-and-file committees], will again try to be the 
protagonists by publicly protesting. This risk must be defused 
with a good government. If 500,000 citizens start protesting 
this is one matter, 5,000 party members is something else. The 
instigators? It is a matter of public safety: The police know 
where Leoncavallo [former Milan squat] is and also where the 
Nazi skinheads are.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Polemics Among PPI Members Over </F>
Floor Leaders"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A controversy is raging within the PPI 
[Italian Popular Party] over the appointment of [Interior 
Minister] Nicola Mancino and [Foreign Minister] Beniamino 
Andreatta as the floor leaders in the lower and upper houses 
respectively. Replying to [Pact for Italy member] Rocco 
Buttiglione, who criticized the appointment by referring to an 
"old faction-based logic," [Institutional Reform Minister] 
Leopoldo Elia said curtly: "Nobody is trying to exclude anybody 
else through the choices made." [PPI member] Roberto Formigoni, 
on the other hand, interpreted Mancino and Andreatta's election 
as "a very serious political signal," because "the choice fell 
on two members of the old DC [Christian Democratic Party] Left." 
  On the other hand, the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] 
deputies' assembly took place without any apparent tensions, 
with Clemente Mastella being elected as the CCD's floor leader. 
Furthermore, the CCD decided to form an autonomous group, which 
will, however, join forces with Forza Italia. 
  National Alliance [AN] also elected its floor leaders. 
Giuseppe Tatarella was elected to Montecitorio [Chamber of 
Deputies], and Giulio Maceratini to Palazzo Madama [Senate], 
both of them unanimously. 
  These first appointments were criticized by [Pannella List] 
Reformers Deputy Elio Vito, in whose view the parties that have 
already proceeded to elect their floor leaders have committed "a 
serious political and institutional blunder. In the lower 
house," Vito recalled, "deputies must indicate the group they 
belong to within two days after the first sitting; in the upper 
house, the same statement must be made within four days after 
the first sitting." Only then, the deputy asserted, should the 
parliamentary groups make any appointments.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Anneli Sundberg: "The Duel for Power"] </F>
  [Text] It was the summer of 1990, and the Center Party of 
Finnish politics was radiant with vitality and glamour. Paavo 
Vayrynen, the battling party chairman, had laid down his arms 
for the time being and had voluntarily relinquished control. His 
stunned enemies and critics almost respected him. Esko Aho, the 
new party chairman, held his victory jubilation under control. 
The vanquished, Eeva Kuuskoski, Seppo Kaariainen, and Olli Rehn, 
held their disappointment under control, but, then, they had 
been able to participate in showing how broad and strong the 
party leadership was. 
  A resounding electoral victory awaited just a few months 
down 
the road. Being in the party was pure bliss. 
  Less than four years later all has vanished: the glamour, 
the 
radiance, the vitality, the will to win. 
  The stars have dimmed, the faces have grown haggard, the 
citizens are enraged, and the party leaders, both old and new, 
are at each other's throats. 
  After the defeat in the presidential elections, the mud at 
the bottom bubbled to the surface; laboriously covered up 
conflicts, feelings of personal grudges, dislikes, and 
disappointment began to surge out with irresistible force. In 
the final analysis, the changing of the guard in the Center 
Party during the sunny summer of 1990 did not, after all, occur 
completely, smoothly, and nicely. The changing is only now 
taking place, and it is happening tortuously and slowly. Two 
lions cannot indefinitely be kept in the same doghouse. 
  Inch by inch Esko Aho, the prime minister and party 
chairman, 
is pushing Paavo Vayrynen aside, out of the party nucleus, which 
has grown too small for these former friends and allies. 
  The battle has been waged in secret for a long time already, 
in fact from the very moment that the Center Party gained its 
great parliamentary election victory and thereby laid the 
cornerstone of Paavo Vayrynen's long enduring dream: a 
nonsocialist cabinet. Vayrynen realized very quickly that Aho 
intended to play first fiddle at every possible occassion. 
  Aho was entranced by his role as prime minister. 
  When Finland's economy collapsed, the prime minister was 
snatched away by the whirlwinds of crises, and Vayrynen was 
deprived of the support he had expected for his great plans. He 
had left the party in good hands that were to bear him all the 
way to the presidential manor; but then what happened? 
  Oh, Vayrynen was allowed into the nonsocialist cabinet, as a 
foreign minister. He had wanted to be the minister of the 
treasury. 
  Aho took care of the country's economy and especially took 
care of his own public image. Vayrynen also expressed his own 
views on economic policy, but met with disapproval. Even those 
who actually agreed with him disapproved of his rocking the boat. 
<H5>  Relations Become Icy </H5>
  Relations between Aho and Vayrynen iced over completely one 
year ago, during the winter that Vayrynen tried to topple the 
now hated nonsocialist cabinet and to engage the Social 
Democrats into joining the government and sharing 
responsibility. At that time Vayrynen was helped by Seppo 
Kaariainen, the chairman of the party's parliamentary group, 
current minister of commerce and industry, whose tolerant 
broad-mindedness, as befits a Savo man, made contact with all 
groupings possible. 
  But nothing worked. 
  Aho was supported by the president and survived. The cabinet 
withstood the crisis, and Vayrynen, who had hoped to become 
prime minister, departed. He was able to take no one with him, 
even though word had spread as far and wide as Sodankyla that 
Martti Pura, the minister of agriculture, would stomp off and 
follow his lord and master out the cabinet door. 
  The entire operation proved to be harmful to Vayrynen. 
  He was permitted to conduct his presidential campaign as he 
saw fit. Aho did not appear to much care how the Center Party 
candidate fared. He stubbornly remained in the background. His 
support could, at best, be described as formal. 
  Vayrynen's hopes were crushed already in the first round of 
the presidential elections. Even during the very last meters 
before election day he had tried to be convincing about his 
Finnish wisdom, sense of humor, and relaxedness. The expensive 
television advertisements proved to be wasted investments, as 
Vayrynen, after the election, spewed accusations in all 
directions. The "criminal" media and the chilly attitude of the 
party leadership both received their share. 
<H5>  A Plan Emerges </H5>
  Once he had recovered, Vayrynen, in his purposeful way, 
began 
to arrange new positions for himself. 
  He desired a politically significant duty for the remainder 
of the tenure of the current Eduskunta. He believed that he and 
his support base could be of use in parrying off the defeat 
threatening his party in the next election. 
  Vayrynen had no desire whatsoever for comforting words and 
head-stroking. He was offered a cabinet post. That wasn't good 
enough. He was offered the politically insignificant deputy 
chairmanship of the parliamentary group. That wasn't good enough. 
  What Vayrynen wanted was the chairmanship of the 
parliamentary group, a position with influence. 
  Unfortunately the position was already filled, so, to 
realize 
his wishes, Vayrynen had to do some arranging and planning. The 
plan actually emerged quite easily and was easy to implement. 
  Kalevi Mattila, the parliamentary group chairman, would just 
move over to the deputy chairmanship, and, bingo -- the way 
would be open for Vayrynen to the chairmanship. He would 
certainly be the unanimous choice, for who could doubt 
Vayrynen's credentials? 
  This construction began to shake badly when one of the 
available cabinet posts went to the "wrong" person. Anneli 
Jaatteenmaki of Lapua took the position that the Vayrynen camp's 
scheme had designated for Seppo Pelttari, a sheriff from Lapland. 
  With a fury arising from desperation the Vayrynen camp 
attempted to hold on to their plan, but, surprisingly, Vayrynen 
and his supporters found that the very tokens of their little 
game had risen up against them. 
  Mattila decided that he wanted to remain as parliamentary 
group chairman after all. There was to be no further discussion 
on the theme that he, supposedly, had for a long time already, 
actually wanted to be deputy chairman. That could now be the 
post for Pelttari and Lapland, as some sort of compensation for 
the cabinet post that he had lost in the selection process. 
  Prime Minister Esko Aho had realized what Vayrynen was up 
to. 
<H5>  Little Game Turns Into Nightmare </H5>
  A trivial-seeming token game gained unprecedented 
dimensions. 
The question was no longer: Who is the chairman of the 
parliamentary group? The question now was: Who is really in 
charge of the party, the present chairman or the former one or 
both? 
  The men drifted into a battle of wills in which apparently 
neither wants to give up. 
  Prime Minister Aho has staked all of his authority into this 
game. At this point Vayrynen has little beyond his steel-hard 
will to place in the game. In earlier political arm-wrestling 
matches, Vayrynen has been able to take advantage of his party 
chairmanship, and up until the very last few weeks, he was 
protected by his presidential candidacy. As an ordinary, 
rank-and-file member of parliament he hardly holds any trump 
cards. As such he cannot even threaten to resign. 
  This elimination game has now been played in public for 
about 
a week, and no manner of conciliation seems to be arising 
between the men. In public Aho tries to present an image of a 
party leader who is against no one, but for each and every one. 
Nevertheless, Vayrynen's back is against the wall, even though 
that wall is padded. 
  People have become accustomed to regard Vayrynen as a man 
who 
never gives up. He will strike back if someone hits him. During 
the dramatic twists of the parliamentary chairman struggle, 
Vayrynen's supporters warned that Vayrynen on the loose is one 
dangerous man. Nevertheless, Aho appeared to be prepared to take 
that risk, even though the party can ill afford to become 
embroiled in a divisive power struggle. 
  Vayrynen now needs to reassess how he can use his own 
prestige and support, and to what ends these will suffice. It 
appears that Aho has gained the upper hand. 
  Vayrynen has expressed in every possible way that, at age 
47, 
he does not in any way at all want to become a political 
old-timer, whose ramblings others can scarcely bear to listen 
to. Unless the knot snarling relations between Aho and Vayrynen 
is opened, Vayrynen needs to seek a new impetus for his 
political future from the parliamentary elections. The prospects 
are not rosy. 
  It appears that the Center Party is headed for disaster in 
the coming parliamentary elections regardless of whether Aho and 
Vayrynen are feuding or at peace. They stand to easily lose more 
than 10 seats in the Eduskunta, unless the Social Democratic 
express train to victory somehow derails.

    [Editorial Report] According to a Finnish News Service 
report carried as lead stories in the 8 April editions of 
Helsinki HELSINGIN SANOMAT and HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, a new 
political party has formed from the ranks of defeated 
presidential candidate Keijo Korhonen, and has as its main goal 
the opposition of European Union [EU] membership. As did 
Korhonen in the February election, the movement's leaders are 
directing their appeal largely to Center Party voters 
disaffected with the policies of Prime Minister Aho's 
center-right coalition, especially its drive to establish closer 
economic and security links with West Europe. Choosing the 
title, The New National Center [UKK], the party plans to hold a 
constituting convention "within the next few months," and then 
-- in the words of provisional Chairman Ilkka Hakalehto -- 
select candidates for the March parliamentary election who will 
"work for the independent motherland's best." The party pledges 
to put up a candidate in every electoral district. 
  In statements released to the press, the main plank in the 
party's platform will be to "follow a policy not dependent on EU 
legislation." Foreign and security policy is to be returned more 
toward traditional neutrality, based on a strong national 
defense. Appealing to voters disaffected with establishment 
parties in general, the party vows to go fight white collar 
crime and corruption, as well as to bring a new force into 
parliament to deal with unemployment and recession. 
  Hakalehto, a former city councilman from Helsinki and Center 
Party member is -- like most others in the provisional 
leadership -- a relatively unknown figure previously involved in 
the anti-EU movement. He and Deputy Chairman Pentti Kettunen, a 
businessman and former Rural Party MP from Kajana, were founders 
of the People's Independence Front, which is now directing its 
efforts to defeating EU membership in the referendum planned for 
late summer or early fall. Korhonen has so far not taken a 
leading role and has vowed not to become a candidate. 
  The Center Party, already badly split, now fears entering 
the 
next election even more divided. Many of its leaders have 
denounced the new movement. Party Secretary Erja Tikka took the 
lead in this, claiming the UKK would not get the minimum votes 
needed to enter parliament, but at the same time would hurt 
Center Party candidates.

  [Excerpts] Environmental investments beyond Finland's 
borders have proved effective, says the Foreign Policy Institute 
in a report. Environmental cooperation with Estonia and Karelia 
has advanced well, but has been badly limping with Russia. 
Jaana Kannninen reports: 
  [Kanninen] Finland has pursued environmental cooperation as 
part of its foreign policy for three years. There have been 
joint projects with four separate regions: Estonia, St. 
Petersburg, Karelia, and Kola. It became clear during these 
years that it is easier for a small unit to work with another 
small unit. The projects in Estonia and Karelia have got off 
the ground well. 
  [Begin unidentified voice recording] The problem areas are 
the Murmansk area, St. Petersburg, and the Leningrad region 
where the scale is large. If one looks at this problem of 
scale, Finland's possibility of having more effective input in 
environmental cooperation in this region lies in seeking 
international cooperation partners, thereby sharing the burden. 
For instance, if we join the European Union, one central 
possibility is to direct the European Union's environment 
policies into these areas and that way acquire more resources. 
[end recording] 
  [Kanninen] Tapani Vaahtoranta, director of the Foreign 
Policy 
Institute, says that there are other reasons too for the failure 
in Russia. The Russians have criticized the Finns for being too 
selfish. According to them, the Finns want, above all, to boost 
their exports of environmental technology. Surprise has also 
been expressed that the Finns want to support what locals regard 
as secondary issues. Why is it so important to clean St. 
Petersburg's effluent when the inhabitants in the region do not 
even have proper drinking water, people have asked. 
  One problem is that, with the exception of the Republic of 
Karelia, Russia's decisions are still made in Moscow, far from 
the problems. The Foreign Policy Institute suggests that 
Finland could start supporting local citizens' organizations. 
[passage omitted] 
  The effluent purification plant in Tallinn is the most 
advanced of the cooperation projects. The renovation of the 
power stations in Narva and the installation of desulphurization 
equipment in Kostamus are also in the construction stage. In 
the past three years, 110 million markkas of Finnish money has 
been spent on near-area cooperation, a sum that has been 
worthwhile spending beyond the border, even for selfish reasons, 
says director Tapani Vaahtoranta. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Harald Stanghelle: "New Tasks for the Home </F>
Guard?"] 
  [Text] The military is working hard and with determination 
to adjust to a new era with an unclear threat picture. I have 
great respect for the military leadership in this regard. 
  This respect does not extend to the Home Guard's official 
publication, HEIMEVERNSBLADET. At that publication they have 
chosen a rather special angle when informing the Home Guard 
members on the challenges facing the defense forces. 
  "A Defense Without a Threat, or the Trojan Horse" is the 
title of a prominently displayed analysis in the latest issue of 
the magazine. The author is described as a Home Guard officer, 
author of several books, athletic leader, politician, and also a 
highly decorated war hero for "his fight against Nazism." That 
makes for a commanding authority. 
  The message is clear: Europe risks being flooded by people 
from poor countries. "These are people from countries where 
they need new lebensraum, better economic conditions, not to 
mention an expansion of their own culture and religion...." 
"Does our military leadership not have the responsibility to 
save Norway as a country for Norwegians?" 
  The parallel to the fight against Nazism is obvious. 
"Perhaps today's advisers in several overpopulated and poor 
countries are cleverer than Hitler's Goebbels?" 
  This threat image entices the author of the article to pose 
a 
number of questions. "Or could this trend have been organized 
from abroad? Or could it be groups who already have gained 
access to our country and who systematically work for expanded 
Islamization which in turn means undermining part of our 
Constitution?" 
  He leaves no doubt what the Norwegian response should be: 
"At 
all times must it be part of the defense forces' mission to 
follow this trend and advise our political leadership.... An 
analysis of what forces are behind this is highly appropriate 
and it is a natural mission for our military." 
  HEIMEVERNSBLADET's analyst is Erik Gjems-Onstad. He is known 
and honored for everything the magazine presented him as, but he 
is also known for something the magazine's editor omitted: He is 
active in various politically dubious right-wing, populist, 
xenophobic parties. 
  Are these the issues the Home Guard leadership wants their 
officers to discuss? Is this the kind of analysis on which the 
defense forces base their assessments? Or is this part of a 
trend that is beginning to find its way to frustrated officers? 
  We certainly do not believe so, but would have felt more 
comforted if the Home Guard would find analysts of greater 
professional stature the next time the Home Guard wants to paint 
the big picture of the future for its officers.

<F P=106> [Article by Ake Ekdahl and Dick Ljungberg: "EU Blurs </F>
Outlines"] 
  [Excerpts] Swedish domestic policy is being forced to grope 
in a vacuum after the election this fall. Regardless of which 
majorities the election on 18 September may create in the 
Riksdag for the next four years, no government will be able to 
submit a definitive government platform until the result of the 
EU [European Union] referendum on 13 November is known. 
  If the voters were to give Carl Bildt the opportunity of 
continuing his coalition government, the government contract 
with the four parties must be renegotiated. The problem is, 
however, that the economic assessments and measures will be 
completely different depending on whether Sweden is an EU 
country or not for the 1994-98 mandate period. Therefore, the 
government cannot supply the principal outlines of its policies. 
<H5>  Economy Will Be Delayed </H5>
  The government's fall proposal for medium-term economic 
policy will be influenced by the same lack of clear 
preconditions and must also be postponed while waiting for the 
EU decision. 
  On the whole, the situation would be identical if the 
parliamentary election were to result in a change of power that 
enabled Ingvar Carlsson to form a government. 
  The government's party composition, the nomination of 
cabinet 
members and their policy programs, with concrete measures for at 
least the first year in the Riksdag, are complicated by waiting 
for over a month for the EU result. 
  In a difficult parliamentary situation it could even become 
difficult for the Riksdag to appoint someone to form a 
government. When New Democracy entered the Riksdag in 1991, Ian 
Wachtmeister first wanted to see the government's platform 
before giving his indirect support to the election of Carl Bildt 
as the new prime minister. [passage omitted] 
  If he gets to stay on, Carl Bildt is prepared for the 
nonsocialist government to write an interim program in which the 
government promises to return with a detailed program platform 
after the decision by the Swedish people on how to deal with the 
EU membership. 
  It could mean that in a multiparty government the 
participating parties must sign a partially blank cooperation 
contract. This could be a point of concern, not least for the 
Center Party, which has already made it clear that the party 
will use the government negotiations after the election to force 
through the inclusion of strong reservations for Swedish 
membership as regards currency cooperation and neutrality. 
  The Center Party also wants to have clear evidence of what 
will happen to the abolition of nuclear power before the party 
agrees to participate in a new Bildt government. Such 
commitments are hardly likely to take place without the 
knowledge regarding EU membership. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Budget Problem </H5>
  Another concern is developing regarding the budget bill. 
After 1996 the budget is to be valid for a calendar year (today 
it runs from the middle of one year to the next). 
  In addition to the fact that in an election year there is 
too 
little time for the government to submit a budget bill for the 
Riksdag no later than 20 September, additional difficulties will 
occur in the transitional period this fall since the fiscal 
period encompasses 18 months, until 31 December 1996. 
  "This is something we have given a great deal of thought," 
says Under Secretary of State Peter Egardt. "It is important for 
the government authorities to be correctly compared with the 
present appropriations period. For this reason we are dividing 
the fiscal year into three half-year periods." 
  With that division Carl Bildt is prepared first to draw up a 
six-month budget from 1 June to 31 December and then a full-year 
budget from 1 January 1996.

  [Text] Stockholm, April 18 (AFP) -- Fourteen Swedish 
organizations opposed to joining the European Union [EU] have 
formed an umbrella organization to campaign against EU 
membership in a referendum scheduled for November 13. 
  Organizers said the new body, which does not yet have a 
name, 
intends to provide every Swedish household with anti-EU 
information in the run-up to the vote. 
  Included in the organization are the anti-EU factions of the 
Social Democrat, Center and Christian Democrats as well as the 
Left Party and Green Party. 
  The umbrella organization has demanded at least 98 million 
kronor (12.5 million dollars) in state campaign funds. 
  Sweden concluded its membership negotiations in March and is 
scheduled for entry into the EU on January 1, 1995 along with 
Finland, Austria, and Norway. 
  But Swedish opposition to the union is strong. 
  According to the most recent poll published in the 
GOETEBORGS 
POSTEN daily on Sunday [16 April], 42 percent of Swedes are 
opposed to membership, while 33 percent are in favour and 25 
percent are undecided.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that if the United 
States had treated the sides in the Cyprus issue equally, the 
problem would have been solved long ago. Denktas made a 
statement after meeting with members of the Turkish Cypriot 
Journalists Union Administrative Council. 
  Commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's report to the 
U.S. Congress, Denktas remarked that this report has the same 
shortcomings as the UN secretary general's report. Denktas 
noted that Clinton's report concerns itself more with the 
contacts conducted on the Cyprus problem and underlines the 
importance the United States attaches to this subject, pointing 
out that the report does not mention the provocative armament 
efforts of the Greek Cypriots. 
  The report refers to opportunities but does not outline the 
obstacles before these opportunities, Denktas said, adding that 
the report does not give any messages to the Greek Cypriots to 
the effect that they are on the wrong path. Denktas explained 
that he does not resent that the report refers to Kliridhis as 
president and to himself as honorable, while adding that this 
attitude spoils the Greek Cypriots by granting them the title of 
legitimate government and fails to assist in the solution of the 
Cyprus problem.

  [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has said that the 
nondocument on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been 
further damaged as a result of the violation of the map during 
the last round of the talks. Replying to a question by a 
Turkish Cypriot News Agency correspondent on whether any results 
were achieved during his visit to Maras [Varosha] yesterday, 
Denktas said that he did not go to Maras to achieve results but 
to see what the two maps submitted by the United Nations were 
about and to determine whether the sections requested in the 
second map were actually within the barbed wire region. He 
added that the sections requested in the second map were not 
remotely connected with the barbed wire region. 
  Commenting on the Greek Cypriot shots fired at Turkish 
Cypriot positions on the border, Denktas noted that it is clear 
that provocations are increasing in all fields. He stressed 
that the side that is wrong and knows it to be so is escalating 
the provocations. Pointing out that it is the duty of the just 
to be patient and coolheaded, Denktas added: I, therefore, 
sincerely congratulate our soldiers and their commanders who 
have maintained their patience, discipline, and their cool in 
the face of these provocations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The entire spectrum of Balkan problems, particularly 
the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
and Cyprus issues and Greek-Albanian relations, are the topics 
that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will discuss with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton at their meeting in the White House on 22 
April. 
  The prime minister, who left at 1330 today for the United 
States via Ireland, revealed the point of his official visit to 
Washington in his statement yesterday that it is a big battle in 
a friendly climate for all our national issues. 
  At his meeting with the Greek prime minister, the U.S. 
President might also raise Greek-Turkish relations and the 
Kurdish issue. After their meeting, the two leaders will give a 
joint news conference. On Wednesday 26 April [as heard], the 
prime minister will meet Archbishop Iakovos of North and South 
America. 
  The prime minister, who is visiting the United States at the 
invitation of President Clinton, will be accompanied by a 
government entourage, economic advisers, and 25 representatives 
from economic organizations. 
  Referring to the prime minister's visit to the United 
States, 
government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that Papandreou, 
within the friendly atmosphere of Greek-U.S relations, will wage 
the battle to promote our national issues. Venizelos said: The 
ultimate goal is to improve Greek-U.S. relations. Improvement 
comes through the help that we naturally expect for promoting 
our national issues and stability in the region. 
  Papandreou will be visiting Washington as Greek prime 
minister. But if issues pertaining to EU [European Union]-U.S. 
relations are raised they will be discussed in his capacity as 
president of the European Council. 
  The government spokesman pointed out that the visit will 
focus on Greek-U.S. relations and added that the ministers who 
are accompanying the prime minister on his visit will have a 
separate schedule of contacts.

  [Text] Late last night vandals broke the windows of an 
all-girls school close to the Greek school in Istanbul and the 
Ecumenical Patriarch's quarters at Fanari. This incident is one 
of a series of others that have occurred recently against the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul. 
  Threatening slogans were written on the walls of the 
Patriarchate and there were repeated attempts to set fires. 
Replying to a question on whether the government made any 
representations on the attack against the all-girl school at 
Fanari, Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the 
government always makes the necessary diplomatic 
representations. We do not know to what extent official Turkish 
policy is reflected in these recent events. Venizelos repeated 
that Turkey should prove that it has some kind of relation to 
what is called European civilization.

<F P=106> [Column by Ferai Tinc: "Green Light to </F>
Massacre"--punctuation as published] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry disclosed 
last week that he is opposed to intervention in Bosnia. He is 
the person who is mainly responsible for the Serbian attacks on 
Bosnia. Apparently, while attempting to have the peace agreement 
between the Bosnians and Croatians implemented, the United 
States has yielded to the blackmailing activities of the Serbs 
to convince them to participate in the peace talks. 
  The UN officials moved to force the Serb troops, which 
besieged Sarajevo, to withdraw some time ago. Meanwhile, they 
warned the Serb armed units to lift their blockade against other 
Bosnian cities, one of which was Gorazde. Later, that position 
was completely abandoned. The Serb units shelled Gorazde's 
suburbs with artillery guns for many days. The aggression 
coincided with the arrival in Sarajevo of Serbian commanders to 
hold talks with the Bosnian and Croatian representatives. The 
Croatian, Bosnian, and Serb representatives were finalizing the 
cease-fire agreement when exploding artillery shells resounded 
from the direction of Gorazde last night. Obviously, the Serbs 
employed the tactic they have used right from the beginning of 
the war in Bosnia. Apparently, their principle is to occupy as 
much territory as they can before a cease-fire agreement is put 
into effect. In fact, they have gained from that approach 
within a short period of time. 
  The Bosnian Serbs, who have taken over 70 percent of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, wish to use the question of territory as a 
trump card when they finally agree to hold talks with the 
Bosnian majority for a federation. They hope to use that trump 
card to maintain an advantage in the talks that will be held on 
the establishment of a federation and to demand concessions for 
each and every inch of territory they will give back to the 
Bosnians. 
  Whether or not the Serbs used chemical arms against Gorazde 
was not established when this column was written. However, it 
is a fact that the Islamic population in Bosnia has been 
subjected to a major attack. 
  Turkey drew the international community's attention to the 
developments in Gorazde during the past week. The Belgrade 
Administration, which has moved to establish a high-level 
dialogue with Turkey, was also cautioned on the matter. 
However, the world preferred to seal its ears once again, and 
Turkey was right again. 
  The way to bargain with an aggressor force is to employ 
similar tactics. William Perry gave the "green light" to the 
massacre by saying: "I will not allow even a single U.S. 
aircraft to take off for Bosnia in the future." 
  Let us wait and see how he will account for that.

<F P=106> [Zafer Kiraz video report from Washington on 14 April -- </F>
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Ambassador Volkan Vural, 
chief adviser of the Prime Minister's Office, briefed the press 
on Prime Minister Ciller's meeting with President Clinton today. 
According to Vural, during the meeting, Clinton congratulated 
Ciller on the election results. Ciller, in turn, briefed the 
President in detail on the economic stability package. Pointing 
out that the economic program demands sacrifices of everyone in 
Turkey, Ciller noted, however, that the package is vital and the 
coalition government will implement it successfully. The prime 
minister stressed that it will be easier to implement the 
economic stability program with foreign support. 
  Vural reported that during the meeting, Clinton described 
the 
measures adopted in Turkey as an important step. According to 
Vural, Clinton pledged that the United States will extend all 
possible assistance to Turkey in its implementation of the 
program. 
  In accordance with President Suleyman Demirel's request, 
during the meeting, Ciller also briefed Clinton on the recent 
situation in Azerbaijan. Pointing out that she expects 
Washington to undertake an initiative to stop Armenian attacks, 
Ciller also expressed the view that with regard to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, NATO air operations against the Serbs should 
be conducted whenever necessary. 
  The Cyprus question was also discussed at the meeting. 
Ciller said that Turkey is in favor of reaching an agreement on 
the confidence-building measures [CBM's] package. Ciller added 
that no changes should be made to the CBM's. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Column by Professor Mumtaz Soysal: "Identification -- </F>
Friend or Foe?"] 
  [Text] The IFF system is used in modern military aircraft. 
The acronym means "Identification -- Friend or Foe?" The 
system is used by allied military aircraft and helicopters. The 
pilots use the system to determine whether the aircraft on their 
radar screens is a friend or a foe. 
  Why did the F-15 aircraft, which are affiliated with the 
Hammer Force, destroy the two Black Hawk helicopters without 
using their IFF systems? Obviously, a stupid communications 
error must have happened, just as in the case of the [USS] 
Saratoga incident in the past. The flight information of the 
U.S. helicopters over northern Iraq was not conveyed to the U.S. 
military aircraft patrolling the region. That was an incredible 
mistake on the part of the U.S. officials. If that is the case, 
it is not totally absurd to postulate the following: The U.S. 
pilots were not informed of the U.S. helicopters' flight plan. 
Could it be that they took them to be Turkish helicopters and 
deliberately shot them down without using their IFF systems? 
According to British aviation experts, confusing the Black Hawk 
helicopters with Iraq's Soviet-made helicopters, even at a great 
distance, is impossible. 
  Meanwhile, it was common knowledge that many Black Hawk 
helicopters were in the air to support the Turkish military 
forces' cross-border operation into northern Iraq. The U.S. 
pilots should have considered that and used their IFF systems. 
  Considering all that, we ask whether we are confronted with 
a 
tragic but comical situation, one in which U.S. officials who do 
not support a military solution to the problem in southeastern 
Turkey, have downed their own helicopters while trying to "teach 
a lesson" to Turkey by destroying one or two of its helicopters? 
  The picture becomes worse when that incident is put into 
context with the "private" talks President Clinton held with 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in Washington. According to the 
U.S. officials who drew up the agenda for the 12-minute talks, 
they were to confer on only three issues, the first being 
Turkey's economy. Clinton was to inform Ciller that he would 
support Turkey's economic stability measures if Ankara agreed to 
sign a "stand-by" agreement with the IMF. The second issue was 
the problem in southeastern Turkey. Ciller would be asked to 
abandon the quest for a military solution and instead seek a 
"political settlement." The third issue was the Cyprus problem. 
An effort had to be made to convince Turkey to say "yes" to the 
"package of confidence-building measures," which has been 
changed by the UN officials. 
  We have been thoroughly informed on the outcome of the 
discussions on the first issue; Ciller disclosed that she agreed 
to the condition on the IMF. However, she is unable to make an 
open disclosure on the second issue because she is aware of the 
consequences of revealing that she has agreed to those terms. 
Meanwhile, in view of her ignorance of past developments, she 
may not fully realize the implications of agreeing to the 
suggestions presented to her on the third issue. Therefore, we 
wish to recall a few points to help her realize who our true 
friends are and who are not. 
  The latest package on Cyprus is very meaningful, regardless 
of the fact that it has been described as a "mini" package. It 
calls for giving up a certain piece of territory. That requires 
reciprocity -- that is, something very substantial and 
permanent. However, the amended package calls for the Turkish 
Cypriot side to lose control of a piece of territory as large as 
Maras [Varosha] itself. That step will probably be taken before 
the Nicosia International Airport is reopened and before 
officials have an opportunity to establish whether or not 
opening the airport has contributed to the lifting of the 
embargo on the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  In view of the abandonment of the former concept on the 
boundary of Maras, the package was only accepted by the Turkish 
Cypriot side due to significant pressure. Considering that, any 
policy tantamount to a step back from that package will be 
rejected in northern Cyprus and Turkey. In fact, such a policy 
would be suicidal. Therefore, those who try to use Ciller's 
lust for power to encourage her to adopt suicidal decisions 
cannot be her friends.

  [Text] Ankara, April 15 (AA) -- A report prepared by a 
parliamentary commission in charge of detecting the existing 
problems and formulating measures on the southeast said that, 
after the terrorism of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is 
stopped, declaring a general amnesty is a must, to accomplish 
domestic peace. 
  The report also called for the restriction of the practice 
of 
regional governorates and the village guard systems. 
  The commission's chairman, Omur Lutfu Coskun, of the 
coalition member True Path Party (DYP), told a press conference 
today that, to prevent terror in the southeast, sensitivity is 
necessary so as not to regard all the region's people as 
potential criminals. 
  "The region should not be a place of exile for civil 
servants 
and the administrators should be loving and understanding in 
their relations with the region's people," Coskun said. 
  Coskun cited other measures foreseen by their report as the 
formulation of urgent and lasting solutions to the problems of 
the region by local administrations, continuation of investments 
planned beforehand, encouragement of agriculture and animal 
breeding, opening new jobs. 
  The report stressed that practices based on using force 
would 
not facilitate the resolving of the problem and the tolerant 
attitude of the state would facilitate a solution sooner.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kemal Bilget, deputy chairman of the </F>
pro-Kurdish Democracy Party, by Zeynel Abidin in Istanbul; date 
not given: "The Junta Constitution Continues To Be Valid in 
Turkey"] 
  [Text] [Abidin] What is the situation of the Democracy 
Party [DEP] at the moment? 
  [Bilget] At the moment our party is fighting a juridical 
struggle. As you know, six of our deputies were arrested in the 
Parliament in Ankara on 2 March after their immunity had been 
rescinded. In addition, investigations are underway against our 
party, which have the goal of banning it. We will defend 
ourselves for the last time at the Constitutional Court tomorrow. 
  [Abidin] What do you think are the reasons for the 
investigations? 
  [Bilget] In Turkey the Constitution is very reactionary. It 
is still the fascist Constitution of 12-September (date of the 
military putsch in 1980 -- NEUES DEUTSCHLAND editor's note). 
This makes it very difficult for someone to even just talk 
about the Kurdish problem, as the DEP does. Even stricter are 
the penal code and the law on political parties, which are 
particularly rigid regarding the Kurdish question. However, we 
have founded the DEP while observing these laws and we are 
orienting our work toward them, that is, we try to observe the 
existing racist laws. For instance, as representatives of the 
party, we have never used the term "Kurdistan." Instead, we 
speak of the "east" or the "southeast" so as not to give the 
state any trump card against us. 
  [Abidin] What are you officilly accused of in the 
proceedings? 
  [Billet] The state has decided to destroy us and it is 
looking for any reason: Our former Chairman Yasar Kaya 
participated in the congress of the Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan in Iraq in 1993 and held a speech at a Kurdish 
festival in Bonn. Proof of that is a video tape, which was 
probably made by the Turkish intelligence service. However, the 
law says that video tapes cannot be used as evidence in court. 
  The second pretext is almost tragicomic: Shortly after the 
founding of the DEP, we started a peace campaign in August 1993. 
In a flier we wrote: "Be it soldiers or Kurdish youths -- in 
any case, it is our people who are dying in the east and the 
southeast. As of now no militant methods should be used 
anymore; instead, democratic solutions must be looked for." 
Saying this is obviously a reason in Turkey to be banned. In 
the investigation proceedings, our deputies are even accused of 
having entered parliament while having cloths in the Kurdish 
colors of green-yellow-red in their pockets. 
  [Abidin] But that means that the juridical grounds for 
banning your party are, actually, very meager. 
  [Bilget] Nevertheless, it looks as if the DEP will be banned 
just as its predecessor, the People's Labor Party (HEP). This 
is a political decision by the state, not a juridical one. 
  [Abidin] In the Turkish public much excitement is caused by 
the fact that the DEP allegedly supports the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan (PKK). This was also an argument for lifting the 
immunity of the deputies. The comment by your arrested party 
chairman Hatip Dicle about the PKK bomb attack on a railroad 
station in one of Istanbul's suburbs was given as an example. 
The attack killed several army cadets. 
  [Bilget] This is the demagogy of Prime Minister Ciller and 
the other leading officials of the state, who want to flatter 
Turkish chauvinism. However, in reality, the DEP has nothing to 
do with the PKK. The PKK is an illegal organization that 
pursues an armed struggle. We, on the other hand, are a legal 
organization that struggles on a democratic basis; a mass party 
founded by educated Kurds from various fields of society. 
  It is true that the PKK and we are supported by the same 
people, namely by the Kurdish population. It may be that some 
of our demands are similar. However, this is not so because we 
support the PKK but because we work for the interests of the 
Kurdish people. 
  Let me use the above example: After the PKK bomb attack our 
party chairman said: "It is said that both sides use such 
places as military targets.... We want the war to come to an 
end as quickly as possible. The reaction to individual actions 
is no solution for that. There are other solutions than 
militant ones." The media wrote afterwards: "Dicle called the 
train with army cadets a military target." 
  [Abidin] Will you found a new party if the DEP is indeed 
banned? 
  [Bilget] We have not yet come to a decision on this matter, 
but we have not immediately started to prepare for founding a 
new party, as was done when the HEP was banned, because we do 
not want to make it so easy to ban the DEP. We will defend the 
party up to the last minute. If necessary, this time we will 
also turn to the international courts. According to Turkish 
laws, if the party is banned, our 2,500 local and city 
councilors are not permitted to exercise any political functions 
for 10 years or to become active in any other party for the same 
period. Therefore, it could be that shortly before the ban we 
will call on all members -- with the exception of our leading 
functionaries -- to leave the party so that they do not have to 
suffer under these consequences. For our parliamentarians, 
however, this is not possible. 
  [Abidin] Your party is massively threatened not only 
juridically but also in physical terms. What are the 
consequences of this fact for your future political work? 
  [Bilget] The DEP has had to pay a high price. When we add 
the HEP, a total of 70 of our representatives have been 
murdered. The assassination attempt on our parliamentary Deputy 
Mehmet Sincar could have hit me -- I was standing beside him 
during the attack, he died in my arms.... More than 20 of our 
party offices have been devastated by bomb attacks more than 300 
delegates have been imprisoned. Our voters have been 
threatened, we ourselves aware not able to run in the local 
elections on 27 March. 
  The sacrifices must not have been in vain. I think, in the 
future we must try to get closer to the Turkish working people, 
too, and to abolish the negative image we have among them. 
  [Abidin] In many Kurdish areas, for instance in Diyarbakir, 
the Islamic Welfare Party (RP) won the local elections. Did 
your voters vote for the RP? 
  [Bilget] Only a minority of them. Most voters either did 
not participate in the elections or handed in empty ballot 
slips. Thus, they behaved in line with our suggestions. By the 
way, in the Kurdish areas the RP was not able to increase its 
number of votes to the same extent as in the Turkish areas. It 
won in some communities only because there it did not have any 
serious competition and because very few voters cast valid 
votes. If we had participated in the elections, the DEP would 
have become the strongest party in this region. 
  [Abidin] Where do you see the reason for the advance of the 
Islamic fundamentalists? 
  [Bilget] In the Kurdish areas the RP was supported by the 
sate. The Government, which does not at all welcome this party 
in the Turkish areas, strengthened it in the Kurdish region. In 
particular the Turkish officers, soldiers, policemen, and the 
members of the special units stationed there voted for the RP. 
  In western Turkey the situation is different. There the RP 
has indeed gained considerably more votes. The success of the 
Islamic fundamentalists is a result of the crisis of Kemalism 
(the official state doctrine of Turkey -- the editors) and of 
the weakness of the left. 
  [Abidin] You have certainly heard about the events that took 
place at the Newroz celebrations in Germany. What do you think 
about that? 
  [Bilget] It looks as if the German Government has still not 
understood the Kurdish problem properly. I think it is trying 
to give positive signals to the Turkish government with its 
actions. However, the Germans should now that this is not 
correct and a danger to democracy in our country, because under 
the slogan of "preventing terrorism" the uncivilized actions of 
the Turkish Government are virtually supported. 
  The Kurds do not want to disturb peace in Germany, that 
would 
not be of any benefit to them, either. I think that German 
politicians sometimes exploit the sensibilities of the 
population, and if the Kurds become loud as people, they present 
it in a wrong light. 
  [Abidin] What would the deportation of "Kurdish activists" 
from Germany mean? 
  [Bilget] From my own experience I would like to say: It may 
be that the deported people will not be executed. However, in 
the prisons in Turkey there are neither rights nor rules. If it 
is not one's body that is executed, it is at least one's honor.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan by </F>
Nedret Ersanel on 8 April; place not given] 
  [Text] [Ersanel] Enrollment in the Army is an issue 
concerning your ministry that is being widely debated in public, 
particularly the situation of Open University students. Have 
you started to enroll these students in the Army? They claim 
that they are being treated unfairly compared with other 
university students. 
  [Golhan] We are given the freedom to act within the law. 
Nowhere does it say that the military service of these students 
must be deferred. Those students who are not registered in 
universities where attendance is mandatory do not have the right 
to have their military service deferred. During the first years 
of the Open University, however, the National Defense Ministry 
granted it the same rights as other universities as a privilege, 
because there was no need for more soldiers. It was the right 
thing to do. In time, however, our sources shrank. There was a 
shortage in the number of soldiers. The number of absentee 
conscripts reached almost 250,000. When the public heard of this 
situation, some 30,000 youths enrolled in the Army. As of 
February this year, the deficit figure is below 210,000. Now, 
we do not want to call up our youths in the Open University 
while the conscription absentees are showing up to enroll. 
However, I want to tell you about a survey we conducted. Some 
82,000 Open University students had to repeat classes twice. We 
cannot have that. We did not call them up this term, but we may 
do so in August or November by calling up those who had to 
repeat classes more than others. The Open University is not 
perturbed by students having to repeat classes, because that is 
its source of revenue. At this stage, we have not called up 
these students, except for those who came voluntarily. 
  [Ersanel] Do you find this way of calling up students 
democratic? Will you call all of them up eventually? 
  [Golhan] We are a constitutional state, a state of law. I 
cannot do otherwise. I hope that we will not have to lean on 
the students too much and that the shortage will be covered by 
the absentees' showing up. We need 30,000-40,000 enrollments 
every conscription period. We cannot take any more anyway. 
Even if all the 82,000 come, we cannot take them. We do not 
have the place to put them. The number of conscripts we need 
now are coming to us. In fact, even if all the absentee 
conscripts show up, we cannot take them. 
  [Ersanel] Are you considering new measures such as extending 
the length of military service, payment instead of military 
service, or extending the scope of discharge? 
  [Golhan] These issues will continue to remain on the agenda 
for some time. At this stage, however, we are not considering 
extending the length of military service. I do not know what 
the conditions will be in the future. We are not considering 
payment instead of military service at this stage, but we might 
in the future. It is a matter of time. Let me say one thing: 
We will eliminate the noncommissioned officers in time. 
  [Ersanel] Is there a change in Turkey's defense concept? 
  [Golhan] Our neighbors are involved in an arms race. They 
are also trying to get hold of, find, and acquire nuclear 
weapons. Therefore, we must keep the Turkish Armed Forces at a 
certain level of power. We hear criticism to our right and to 
our left. We maintain the same priorities in our defense 
concept. Our neighbors to the south -- let me not say who they 
are -- are in the race for nuclear arms. At the moment, they do 
not have nuclear arms, but they have long-range missiles that 
can hit Ankara. We must take our measures. 
  [Ersanel] How? 
  [Golhan] We must not lag behind them; that is all I can say. 
If those who covet our land know that we lack the necessary 
weaponry, they may become aggressive. Let me say this: Turkey 
is the most powerful military force in the region, except for 
the missile issue. Unlike other countries, we do not violate UN 
resolutions. 
  [Ersanel] Germany displayed a harsh stand in connection with 
the weapons it gives to Turkey being used in the southeast. How 
do you view this? 
  [Golhan] The problem is this: We bought some weapons from 
Russia. They are very similar to the German weapons. Foreign 
press members who were in the southeast confused the two. They 
said that the weapons were German-made and made a big noise 
about it. We received a letter from the German defense minister 
today in which he thanks us. We are going to buy weapons from 
Germany on the basis of our defense industry cooperation. He 
says he will be of assistance. Foreign Minister Kinkel's message 
is along the same lines. 
  There are many PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members in 
Germany. They are friendly with the press, and they have money. 
It is they who spread the rumor that Turkey is using these 
weapons. Of course, we must not forget that there will be 
elections in Germany soon. 
  First, they alleged that we were using the weapons against 
the Kurdish people in the region. Then they said we should not 
use them against the PKK. What else do they want? Are there 
only German weapons in the world? I can use my U.S.-made or 
Russian-made weapons. 
  [Ersanel] The United States has been talking recently, 
especially in meetings held in Turkey, about a "political 
solution" to the Kurdish problem. You participated in those 
meetings. You held your most recent contact with the Americans 
in connection with this issue last Thursday. What is this 
"political solution" mentioned by the United States and, in a 
way, by the West? 
  [Golhan] Look, until two years ago, we heard the HEP 
[People's Labor Party] and then the DEP [Democracy Party] 
deputies talk about a "political and democratic solution." What 
is this solution? They said there cannot be a solution with 
military force. All right, what is the solution? They do not 
say. 
  Behind this solution implied by our friends and certain 
circles is a separate and independent Kurdish state. The idea 
of a federation lies behind this political solution. That is 
the meaning. The Kurds have free elections, free trade, the 
right to settle and work anywhere in the country. What other 
rights do they want? These are the rights I have, too. Do 
people who speak Kurdish have a problem? 
  [Ersanel] Earlier, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Oxman 
also talked about a political solution. So, is what the U.S. 
officials mean no different from what you are saying? 
  [Golhan] Yes, what they say is no different from what I am 
saying. Charles Freeman, assistant U.S. secretary of defense, 
came to me on Thursday and said: "The PKK is certainly a 
terrorist organization." He said: "Europe will also realize 
this one day." 
  [Ersanel] Did he say what he means by a political solution? 
  [Golhan] No. The aim of the political solution is a 
federation. Let me tell you that frankly.

<F P=106> [Article by Ismet G. Imset: "Southeast Burden To Grow"] </F>
  [Text] The strongest repercussion of the newly announced 
economic package is to be observed in the impoverished Southeast 
region of Turkey where Kurdish separatists have been fighting a 
bloody war since 1984 at the cost of more than 11,000 lives. 
Poverty and unemployment is high in this region where some 
400,000 security forces consisting of soldiers, policemen and 
paramilitary village guards have been deployed. 
  Reports from within the military is that Ankara is currently 
considering to send some 150,000 additional troops to the region 
this summer in a bid to deliver a final blow to the outlawed 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
  News is that security forces are currently sweeping the 
mountainous areas and the PKK death toll is quite high. But 
there is a general consensus--even among security commanders in 
the region--that the campaign is not solving the problem but 
serving only to postpone it for the future. Just like Turkey's 
crackdowns on 28 separate Kurdish uprisings in its republican 
history. 
  Each and every measure, meanwhile, is increasing the cost of 
this undeclared war--which the military, as in many countries 
where guerrilla wars are fought, insistently refer only to [it] 
as an armed conflict or "limited warfare." 
  Turkey's military commanders and state officials naturally 
avoid accepting the concept of war for the crisis, aware that 
this would not only give legitimacy to the other side of the 
conflict but also turn it into a counterpart. 
  Counterpart or not, the PKK has become a major problem for 
Turkey in many fields. Observers of the conflict argue it would 
be a severe mistake to insist on seeing the current problem as 
one of a terrorist nature alone. 
  Indeed, Ankara's approach to the crisis has been a highly 
hypocritical one over the past two years, and this alone has put 
into force a military campaign without any economic, social or 
cultural backing. The promise, year after year since 1984, has 
been to "break the backbone of the terrorists." 
  The argument, one which has gone bankrupt, has been that the 
problem: is a) One which stems not from Turkey but from foreign 
countries with foreign support; b) A problem of terrorist nature 
alone; and c) A problem which will surely be solved without 
having to "give in" to international demands aimed at "dividing 
Turkey." 
  In other words, despite what Turkish representatives recite 
in foreign capitals with regard to Ankara's recognition of the 
"Kurdish identity"--a recognition which lacks any 
substance--Turkey insistently denies recognizing it is dealing 
with a Kurdish problem. 
  Unfortunately, the "Kurdish problem," which Ankara fails to 
recognize, is not a problem of terrorism. Nor is it a problem 
created by "a handful of bandits" as claimed repeatedly by 
officials over years of ignorance. Fortunately for Turkey, 
though, it is not only a "PKK problem" either. 
  As a moderate pro-Kurdish magazine recently summarized it, 
"The Kurdish problem is the problem of 20 million people (in the 
Middle East) wanting to live freely and like human beings." The 
problem, which started off as one based on demands for further 
rights, equality and even autonomy, has now turned into a battle 
on the Kurdish part for the restoration of principal human 
rights and the right to live. 
  PKK attacks, mainly on Kurdish civilians, and 
counter-terrorist operations in the region have literally 
suffocated the local population--best expressed in increased 
migration to the cities, depopulation of villages and new deaths 
every day. 
  Recently, SABAH newspaper columnist Hasan Cemal wrote after 
visiting the region and holding talks with the most senior 
officials there that Turkey had decided to introduce "bitter 
medicine" in the Southeast. 
  According to him, the evacuation of villages, razing them to 
the ground, forceful depopulation of certain areas and "mystery 
killings" which are observed every day are part of this bitter 
medicine. 
  In other words, what has taken place until now is being 
regarded only as mild medicine despite its results and the 
bitter dose is newly being injected. 
  Thus, the people of the Southeast now face two doses of 
bitter medicine in contrast to Turks living in other parts of 
the country. 
  On one hand, they have to suffer the "bitter medicine" in 
the 
military field and with military measures. On the other, they 
will suffer from the "bitter medicine" Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller offered the nation on April 5. A medicine which even 
World Bank officials said was "medicine by the bottle rather 
than the spoon." 
  Economic hardships are to be felt even more in this troubled 
region where unemployment is hovering at around 70 percent and 
investments and business have come to a halt owing to terrorism. 
All of the pain inflicted nationwide with the new austerity 
package is bound to be doubled, or even tripled, in this region 
where salaries are relatively low and opportunities are scarce. 
<H5>  The Situation </H5>
  Since 1984, when the PKK launched its first attacks on two 
Turkish targets, Turkey has been seeking to solve the crisis in 
the region through military policies alone, refusing to see into 
the realities of the crisis, correctly diagnose it and treat it 
accordingly. 
  The result of this policy can be summarized in three parts, 
disregarding how the PKK itself regards the situation. First of 
all, the mistaken policy put into force in the region and 
Turkey's insistent refusal to grant the Kurds their cultural and 
social rights has led to a strengthening of the PKK over the 
past decade. This strengthening has further been boosted by 
widespread human rights violations in the region. Despite the 
violations by the PKK, including the mass killing of Kurdish 
women and children, Turkish violations have received more 
coverage in the international media. Having accepted that the 
PKK is a "terrorist" organization, many Non-Governmental 
Organizations (NGOs) and even foreign governments have started 
to see PKK violence as "a natural phenomena of terrorism" but 
have rightfully expected Turkey, a state, to live up to the 
standards of being a state. This situation, on one hand, has 
strengthened the PKK's popular support in the Southeast and, on 
the other, has boosted international sympathy for the Kurds 
altogether-- often being mixed up with sympathy for the PKK, 
which claims it represents Turkish Kurds. 
  Secondly, through its insistence on a military solution to 
the crisis and despite all that has been said, Turkey has been 
forced to change its overall approach to the Kurds in the recent 
years. Although officials may dislike the current position 
Ankara has fallen into, it is evident that PKK attacks and a 
constant wave of violence has a) Pushed Turkey into lifting a 
military-imposed ban on using the Kurdish language; b) Accepting 
the "Kurdish identity" although it has still not done anything 
about it and c) Debating the overall problem more freely even 
though "unwanted opinions" are still being repressed immediately. 
  Turkey, in its failure to take any cultural, social or 
economic steps to lift the burden off the shoulders of its 
Kurdish people, has had to make concessions instead, ending up 
indexing its own "Kurdish policy" on the PKK alone. This is a 
concession which no state should end up making. 
  Thirdly, the military solution sought for the Kurds of 
Turkey has not only strengthened the PKK, hurt Turkey's own 
image abroad and pushed Ankara to the point of concessions, but 
has also yielded some frightening results: 
  1. There has been an immense alienation between the Turkish 
and Kurdish people who have created this country hand in hand 
and who share 1,000 years of a joint history. Turkish 
frustration at terrorist attacks by the PKK has been channeled 
into reaction to the Kurds in general and vice versa. This 
alienation is now systematically being fanned by activists of 
the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and certain local forces. 
2. The failure of the military policy put in force since 1984 
has finally forced Turkey's civilian administration into giving 
a major concession to the Army, allowing military commanders 
once again to play a dominant role in all national affairs. In 
the absence of any alternative and in the form of "a last bid," 
the civilians have surrendered authority to the military, 
believing "this time" again that the latter will be able to 
solve the problem. 
3. Aware that it cannot tackle the Kurdish issue having 
strengthened the stance of the military to this extent, Turkey's 
civilian administrators have yielded to pressure for further 
authority and agreed with military plans to force the local 
populace "to make a choice." Currently, the 1994 campaign aims 
at forcing the civilian populace in the region to "decide which 
side they are on" and act accordingly. Both the PKK and Turkish 
security forces are against "undecided masses" and aim at 
forcing them to their sides. If this systematic campaign cannot 
be prevented, there will be no "undecided" or "innocent" 
civilians in the region and the society will be broken into two 
major parts, the village guards and the militia. 
  4. There has also been an increase in regional support to 
pro-Islamic policies in the region which, in the absence of a 
pro-Kurdish political formation, has led to a major victory of 
the Welfare Party. All of Turkey's past "Kurdish uprisings" 
have been Islamic in nature, and there is concern that this new 
development may trigger an even more serious crisis. 
  5. Finally, the cost of the military campaign on terrorism 
has grown by the day and continues to increase. It has now 
turned into an incredible burden on Turkey and the Turkish 
people. 
<H5>  The Burden </H5>
  The burden is, to be frank, far greater for Turkey than any 
"political solution" to the problem could have brought forth 
until now. 
  Whether Turkey is truly aware of the cost of this undeclared 
war is not quite clear although it is evident that the crisis is 
serving the interests of at least some regional circles such as 
the feudal landlords who are following Middle East fashion and 
are creating their own small-scale armies and making a great 
profit out of them. 
  And, there have been those countries who have unwillingly 
participated in the conflict. Countries which are now 
exploiting their past decisions to blackmail Turkey on the 
international platform. 
  Germany, for instance, is Turkey's largest light arms 
supplier in the sense of weaponry used in the Southeast "border 
region" and is now making trouble for Ankara, claiming its 
weapons have been used against the PKK while they were delivered 
only for NATO-related defense purposes. 
  According to independent figures, Germany has delivered DM 
[German Mark] 3.6 billion worth of arms in the form of grants to 
Turkey in the 1985-1991 period. But it was only after the Gulf 
war that East German weapons were spotted widely in the region. 
A grant of 256,125 Kalashnikov-type assault rifles, 100,000 RPG 
Bazookas, 300 BTR 60 type armored vehicles and 450 million 
ammunition is part of this grant. The estimated cost of the 
package is somewhere around DM 1.5 billion. 
  On top of this, it is noteworthy that Germany (or rather 
German companies) were those who supplied the 
weapons--especially chemical weapon components--needed in Saddam 
Husayn's past campaign against the Kurds. A campaign which, in 
Halabjah in 1988 alone, wiped away a total of 5,000 Kurdish 
civilians who were gassed to death. 
  Western countries clearly have their "own" interests in the 
regional Kurdish conflict and often play a vital role in shaping 
events. But in the case of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, not 
even foreign assistance or grants have lifted the burden off 
Turkey. 
  Ciller, while in Diyarbakir on Dec. 31, 1993 just before 
some 
150,000 new troops were sent to the region, told journalists 
that there were a total of 160,000 military personnel and 40,000 
village guards in the Southeast. Since then, many more 
villagers have been forced to take up weapons against the PKK, 
and the number of village guards, according to a REUTERS report 
on Wednesday, has reached 58,000. 
  Now with these new troops deployed to the region, the cost 
of this decade-old "operation" is even higher. Special police 
crack teams, policemen, National Intelligence Agency (MIT) 
personnel and special squads have to be added to this cost in 
1994. According to Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, Turkey has 
spent a total of TL [Turkish lira] 800 trillion on the Southeast 
campaign since 1984. HURRIYET newspaper columnist Nese Duzel 
recently wrote that Turkey was spending an annual $7 billion for 
the security campaign, the equivalent of DM 120 billion. 
  In 10 years, this would make up a total of $70 billion 
disregarding increases in prices and the increase in the cost of 
the campaign. 
  In 1993, the predicted inflation rate was at 53 percent but 
according to official figures was realized at 71 percent with 
the undeclared war making its impact on the overall economic 
situation of Turkey. The same year, the Istanbul Chamber of 
Commerce put the inflation rate at 80 percent. 
  Turkey's economic problem is great, but problems are even 
greater in the Southeast where the economy has come to an end. 
Now, with the government trying to tackle what Ciller has 
branded as "economic terrorism," the crisis is to deepen even 
further. 
  By Thursday, it was evident that Ciller's bid to build a new 
structure on the one she herself ruined was not working out as 
planned. The wave of price hikes had increased public suffering 
throughout Turkey but appeared to be close to being worthless 
with the dollar rate soaring and reaching TL40,000 by Thursday 
morning compared to the TL23,000 on Monday. 
  Even now, approximately $1.3 billion is being paid to 
village 
guards in the region while reports are that the secret budget 
allocated to Southeast officials is around TL6.6 trillion. 
Aside from these, the state is compensating and awarding 
security officials in the region. Policemen based there are 
receiving a monthly salary of TL20 million and senior soldiers 
are getting some TL19 million, around 10 million more than their 
colleagues based in other parts of the region. According to 
information with the Turkish Human Rights Association, there are 
100 warplanes, 40 Cobra, 35 Sikorski and 230 classic helicopters 
in the region aside from hundreds of armored personnel carriers, 
trucks, jeeps and tanks. The approximate cost of one takeoff for 
a warplane is reportedly $4,000. Turkey's recent air raid on a 
PKK camp in northern Iraq some 500 kilometers away cost Ankara 
TL22.7 billion disregarding personnel costs. But even this 
amount was met with salary cuts from ordinary, compulsory 
soldiers who earn around $1 per month these days. 
  Recently, the state issued 27,100 Kalashnikovs to villagers 
in Erzurum and Erzincan, in eastern Turkey. A total of 112,500 
mines were planted on the Iraqi border and so on. 
  The cost of the war is growing in a bizarre way each and 
every day. While the Turkish nation has paid for this war for 
10 years, both with its martyrs and taxes, Kurdish citizens of 
the republic who live in the region have had to suffer the 
consequences in many ways. 
  Says a recent issue of DENG magazine, believed to be 
affiliated with the moderate Kurdistan Socialist Party: "The 
Turkish state is cornered. It is not capable of meeting the 
economic bill of this warfare. Inflation and unemployment is 
spreading wildly. Investments have come to an end. Although the 
state is channelling all of its means to this unjust and dirty 
war, it is bound to be crushed by the economic burden of this 
war." 
  On one hand, hundreds of innocent people have been killed. 
On the other, hundreds of Turkish soldiers have been martyred. 
Meanwhile, everyone is now "paying" for the policy currently 
underway. 
  The people of the Southeast are to pay even more than the 
others in the days ahead. For they are to suffer both from the 
PKK's terrorism and the indiscriminate campaign said to be 
against terrorism. They are also going to suffer more under the 
new austerity package. 
  Whichever way the Kurdish people turn, the locals of 
southeast Turkey face only one alternative: taking bitter 
medicine. The PKK is bitter medicine. The security clampdown 
is bitter medicine. And, economic austerity is bitter medicine. 
The people have been forced into becoming patients. But all 
prescribed treatments until now have been based on mistaken 
diagnosis. 
  This problematic situation has already yielded its first 
result which some believe is even a greater threat for Turkey 
than the PKK. Islamic activism is on the rise in the region. 
Aside from the PKK, which is a "separatist" phenomenon against 
the establishment, there is now a Kurdish-Islamic outlet against 
the establishment. One which, in the past history of Turkey, 
has led to several severe Islamic Kurdish uprisings. 
  The general feeling is that the Welfare Party will be 
skillfully exploiting the consequences of Ankara's so-called 
austerity package from now on and that it could gain more 
sympathy, not only among the Kurdish people, but also within the 
security apparatus in the region--claiming to be the only 
legitimate alternative to end the bloodshed. 
  The impact of the new austerity package is bound to triple 
in 
the Southeast, where the pain is felt greater than in other 
parts of the country. Poverty is to be greater there. 
Unemployment is to soar. Businesses will go bankrupt. 
Villagers will be suffering and the anti-establishment trend 
will find optimum space to flourish more and more, with the 
touch of the green crescent. There, the burden is too great for 
everyone....

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Yalcin Ozer: "A Policy Goes Bankrupt"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Cem Boyner, a leading young businessman, has 
said the following about the economic stability package 
announced by Ciller: "With this package our politicians are 
telling the people that they were not able to run the country 
properly." 
  It is true. However, there is a positive aspect to this. In 
previous years, it was military regimes that imposed such heavy 
measures. This time, a civilian government is trying to correct 
a bankrupt policy it took over from other civilian politicians. 
[passage omitted] 
  Another thing our country can be pleased about is that the 
citizens no longer trust politicians who lie. The citizens are 
more able to grasp the truth now. They will no longer vote for 
any politician promising everyone "two keys" [for a house and a 
car, as promised by Demirel when he was True Path Party leader]. 
  Tansu Ciller said: "I will definitely defeat terrorism in 
the 
economy. I am preparing a bitter medicine for you." And she 
won the elections. 
  We believe that this is a good sign and a guarantee for the 
future of democracy in Turkey as well. Our democracy seems to 
have matured to a point where the civilians clean up the mess 
made by other civilians. 
  We must not forget that another mature element is the Social 
Democratic Populist Party. Displaying maturity, the party set 
aside social policies and bowed before economic rules. 
  However, we still want to remind our readers to beware of 
lying politicians. They might influence innocent citizens. 
Their remarks might be effective given the fact that the 
livelihood of many will be disturbed. 
  We want the government to be just, however. The Turkish 
people are extremely sensitive about this. The sacrifices must 
be distributed evenly. The package is a good opportunity to 
correct the salary injustices that have been going on for years. 
For example, while the package foresees that many workers will 
be laid off, Central Bank employees receive double salaries 
every two months. That is not fair. 
  If the government implements them justly and vigorously, 
there is no reason why the measures should not succeed.

  [Excerpts] Ankara, April 18 (A.A.) [Passage omitted] 
Foreign Ministry under secretary Ozdem Sanberk returning from a 
trip to Jordan and Iraq, told reporters at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport that a memorandum of understanding was reached with 
Iraq, adding a team of Iraqi officials will come to Ankara in 
the next months to meet on technical details with BOTAS [Turkish 
Oil and Natural Gas Company] officials. 
  He said that the cleaning work could be started within two 
to 
three months adding, however, that no precise date can be set up 
at this point. 
  Sanberk said that the cleaning work will be for "reparation" 
and "saving the pipeline from rotting" therefore not against any 
UN imposed sanction. 
  Sanberk said technicians now had to work out "modalities of 
the technicalities of the flushing-out (operation)...." Once 
such arrangements are in place, the rescue operation for the 
whole Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline system could start. 
  "Under the plan, the pipelines must be flushed and refilled 
for correct maintenance until regular flow is resumed," Sanberk 
said. 
  "The pipeline has not been used for almost three years, it 
is 
a very valuable asset and we do not want to it to deteriorate," 
he added. 
  "The purpose was to see whether corrosion had set in and 
repair the pipeline to have it ready for the day when the 
embargo is lifted," Sanberk said. [passage omitted] 
  Sanberk said talks during his trip to Baghdad also covered 
trade and political issues, including Iraq's latest diplomatic 
campaign to get the sanctions lifted or eased. 
  Ankara has called for easing the embargo but wants Baghdad 
to 
fully comply with UN demands to scrap its weapons of mass 
destruction so the oil and trade ban on Baghdad can be lifted. 
  It also wants Iraq to recognize the newly-demarcated border 
with Kuwait and open a dialogue with Kurds in Northern Iraq. 
  The three-year-old trade sanctions have caused millions of 
dollars in losses to Jordan and Turkey, Iraq's neighbors and 
main trade partners.

  [Text] The Ninth Court of Appeals has endorsed a decision 
by a court in 1993 to suspend the publication of the newspaper 
OZGUR GUNDEM. In view of the endorsement, the publication of 
the newspaper has been suspended for 15 days. Meanwhile, the 
endorsement also confirmed the sentences that were passed on 
Chief Editor Seyh Davut Karadag and OZGUR GUNDEM's former 
proprietor Yasar Kaya. Kaya was fined 124 million Turkish lira. 
Seyh Davut Karadag will be sent to prison for five months and 
pay 62 million Turkish lira as a fine. 
  The Second State Security Court in Istanbul decided to 
suspend OZGUR GUNDEM's publication for 15 days for publishing an 
interview with Kurdish Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan 
entitled "The Turkish Left Wing and Unity" and an article by 
Abdulkadir Konuk entitled "Solidarity Platform" on 2 and 3 May 
1993. The Second Court of Appeals endorsed the State Security 
Court's sentences against Yasar Kaya and Seyh Davut Karadag, 
which were in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of the 
Antiterrorism Law in Turkey. 
  The newspaper's officials were informed of the court's 
decision yesterday. The publication of a daily newspaper will 
be suspended in accordance with the Antiterrorism Law for the 
first time in the country. OZGUR GUNDEM's publication will be 
suspended until 30 April starting today. 
  The Istanbul branch of the Contemporary Journalists' 
Association has criticized the decision to suspend OZGUR 
GUNDEM's publication. Arguing that OZGUR GUNDEM has been 
silenced after the newspapers FREE FUTURE and BANNER OF TOIL 
were closed down in the past, it described the suspension of the 
newspaper for publishing many reports that were also carried by 
other media as a double-standard policy. Saying that opinions 
cannot be removed by the use of force, the branch called for the 
lifting of restrictions on the press.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with former Burundian President Pierre </F>
Buyoya and former Burundian Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi by Rik 
De Gendt in Brussels; date not given: "Burundi Still Counting 
on Belgian Aid"] 
  [Text] "Developments in Rwanda are going to partly 
determine the future of Burundi and of the whole region. The 
last thing we needed was this upsurge of ethnic hatred and 
violence. I can fully understand the painful experiences of the 
past week, but Belgium must not abandon its responsibilities. 
In our country, Belgium certainly has a contribution to make in 
creating the political dialogue that is so necessary in order to 
achieve a lasting peace." These are the words of former 
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya in an interview with DE 
STANDAARD. Shortly before, he had met with State Secretary for 
Development Erik Derycke. 
  "Ethnic extremism is like a drug," Buyoya stated. "It causes 
people to do things which they no longer control and which, in 
the long run, are against their own interests. There are many 
examples of this. Both in Burundi and Rwanda, the killers of 
Presidents Melchior Ndadaye and Juvenal Habyarimana believed 
they could strengthen or secure their position. They achieved 
the exact opposite. In both countries, the attacks resulted in 
complete disintegration." 
  The former Burundian president believes it is of the utmost 
importance for the warring factions to quickly achieve a 
cease-fire and that, above all, the country needs a balanced 
government. 
  "The plan is there: The protocol for power sharing as 
included in the Arusha peace agreement. If, on the other hand, 
Rwanda gets an extremist government of any kind, the whole 
region will quickly go up in flames." 
  The same calls for power sharing apply just as much to 
Burundi. With his policy of reconciliation and national unity 
during his period in power (1987-1993), Pierre Buyoya drew much 
applause from friend and foe, at home and abroad. Some people 
would like to see him return to playing a more active political 
role. 
<H5>  Elections </H5>
  "Last June, Ndadaye won a convincing election victory," 
Buyoya openly states. "I would find it dishonest to now take 
back through the back door that which I then lost in an open 
contest. When Ndadaye succeeded me, I decided to withdraw from 
political life for the time being. I am still a member of the 
UPRONA [Unity for National Progress] party, but have no leading 
role. I did not want to be tainted with the image as opposition 
leader. I can do much more good through discreet contacts. I 
was proved right by events, although I could not avoid certain 
mishaps. Psychological elements are also involved. Our country 
needs a period of, let us say, 10 years with a Hutu president in 
order to do away with all ethnic taboos once and for all." 
  Pierre Buyoya discussed with State Secretary Derycke on 
Wednesday the question of possible Belgian aid in further 
supporting the rebuilding of democracy in his country. 
  "Belgium can play an important role," Buyoya believes. "The 
Belgians know our countries and people very well, and there is 
still a considerable Belgian presence in Burundi. In addition 
to sustained opposition in principle to any form of ethnic 
cleansing and violence, I hope that Belgium will continue to 
help to bring about and maintain political dialogue between all 
elements in our society. There is no other way for us." 
<H5>  Training </H5>
  Former Burundian Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi was also in 
Brussels on Wednesday. To everyone's surprise the first 
democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, chose this 
economist to head his government in July last year. She feels 
that she must continue to play a part in the political life of 
her country. 
  "The fact that I am still alive is probably because I am a 
woman," she says. "A male prime minister would never have 
survived last October's coup d'etat. Women politicians have a 
very particular contribution to make to a country's development, 
because by their very nature they look to the future and the 
well-being of their children." 
  The assistance she expects from foreign partners is 
principally in the field of training and development. 
  "The problems facing our country are not so much rooted in 
ethnic questions as in poverty, underdevelopment and, above all, 
a disturbed or absence of balance in the structures. The latter 
is most seriously evident in the Army. But if you do not 
believe that things can change, then things will never change." 
  "Our Western partners and Belgium above all, can be of 
tremendous assistance to us in training political leaders who 
are able to make objective analyses and manage the mechanisms of 
democracy and who are primarily concerned by the real needs of 
their people. I see support for this training as a priority 
form of development aid," Sylvie Kinigi concluded.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
stressed that the bloodshed in the east Bosnian town of Gorazde 
must be stopped. "Every effort must be made" to bring this

region. Kohl talked to U.S. President Bill Clinton and French 
President Francois Mitterrand about the situation in Gorazde by

  [Text] Nicosia, Apr 18 (CNA)--President Glavkos Kliridhis 
said Monday [18 April] that only through a result-oriented 
approach by the U.N. Security Council, progress can be expected 
towards a Cyprus settlement. 
  Receiving the credentials of the first ever South African 
ambassador to Cyprus, Paul K. Coetzee, the president referred in 
great detail to the developments of the Cyprus problem. 
  "In our effort to break the deadlock caused by the Turkish 
side," he said, "we responded favourably to the initiative of 
the U.N. secretary general and held proximity talks on the 
confidence building measures (CBM's)." 
  The president noted that the Turkish side tried, however, to 
exploit the procedure of the talks and to secure political 
advantages contrary to the guidelines set forth by the secretary 
general at the beginning of the process. 
  "The Turkish side proved that it lacks the political will to 
reach an agreement even on the CBM's, let alone on the substance 
of the Cyprus problem. As was the case in the last 20 years, 
the Turkish side frustrated once again all efforts to reach an 
agreement," he said. 
  President Kliridhis stressed "we believe that the time has 
come for the security council to consider alternative ways to 
promote the effective implementation of its numerous decisions 
on Cyprus." 
  He continued: "It is my firm conviction that only through 
result-oriented approach by the Security Council we can expect 
to see progress towards a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus 
problem." 
  Referring to the accreditation to Cyprus of the first South 
African diplomat and Cyprus' decision to establish a consulate 
general in Johannesburg, the president said these actions were 
"indicative of our common desire to promote and strengthen our 
bilateral relations." 
  The presence in South Africa of a considerable number of 
South Africans of Cypriot origin, who actively and 
constructively participate in South Africa's national life, 
constituted an additional bond of friendship between the two 
peoples, he added. 
  Presenting his credentials, Coetzee said that "South Africa 
supports the prospect for a peaceful negotiated settlement of 
the situation that your country is facing." 
  Referring to the thriving Cypriot-South African community, 
the diplomat said that ``these expatriates from Cyprus have 
contributed their rich and refined cultural heritage together 
with an immense and active idealism to their new country and 
have become respected, prominent and successful citizens of my 
country. 
  ``In many instances they, together with others, have through 
the years forged solid business and other ties between our 
countries. The establishment of bilateral relations between our 
two countries is bound, however, to expand these relations 
substantially,'' he added.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that if the 
problems regarding the Serbian attacks on Gorazde are not solved 
then this will be an indication that the international system 
has collapsed. Replying to reporters' questions on the issue at 
the Cankaya Mansion, Demirel said that NATO which has been a 
deterrent force against nuclear war close to 45 years has been 
reduced to a position where it cannot even protect a city. He 
added: Not only Turkey but all the NATO member countries and 
everyone who is responsible for and in favor of peace in Europe 
should ponder this issue. Demirel said: 
  [Begin recording] I am concerned that, and I have been 
saying this for close to a year now, the United Nations which is 
charged with securing world peace and the UN Security Council 
have been unable to implement the CSCE resolutions in Europe 
because they do not have the power to impose sanctions. The 
Gorazde incident is not an insignificant one. The quiet 
achieved in Sarajevo for a while [words indistinct]. The 
Gorazde developments can wipe it all out. There will be other 
incidents in other parts of the world. This international system 
can collapse. Maybe the word collapse is a very strong one but 
it can be greatly damaged. A damage that is close to a 
breakdown. [end recording] 
  Demirel stated that the Serbs have the weapons of the former 
Yugoslav Army, and that the people of Gorazde cannot procure 
arms because of the embargo. Recalling that he has been arguing 
with world leaders for the last year saying that they neither 
protect the Bosnian people nor sell them arms, Demirel concluded 
by saying that he sent messages on the issue to everyone.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/37: "Declaration on Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] The European Union [EU] condemns the continuing 
Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde in violation of UN Security 
Council resolutions and calls for an immediate and unconditional 
cease-fire in and around Gorazde and the pullback of Bosnian 
Serb forces which threaten the security of Gorazde. 
  This will enable the deployment of UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Force] forces to the town to take place. 
  All detained United Nations' personnel should be released 
straight away and be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement in 
accordance with United Nations' resolutions. The humanitarian 
effort, the passage of which through Bosnian Serb-held territory 
is currently suspended, should be given unimpeded access to the 
people of Gorazde and more widely in Bosnia including to 
Sarajevo. 
  The European Union invites the state members of the European 
Union which are members of the Security Council to support the 
adoption without delay of a binding resolution in support of 
these objectives. 
  The European Union expresses its full support for the 
efforts 
of the special representative of the UN Secretary General and 
UNPROFOR commanders and confirms its support for Atlantic 
Alliance forces in their underpinning of United Nations action. 
  It also pays tribute to the committed work of UNHCR and 
other 
volunteer agencies, which include many EU citizens, which 
continue their humanitarian mission despite the appalling 
difficulties that they face on the ground. The European Union 
calls upon those nations which have promised additional forces 
to the United Nations to ensure that they arrive in Bosnia 
quickly. 
  A cease-fire in and around Gorazde is the first essential 
and 
the European Union calls upon the Bosnian Serbs to honour their 
word in the negotiations chaired by the United Nations. This 
should be followed quickly by a general cease-fire throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. A general cease-fire would be a prelude to 
negotiations for a political settlement involving the whole of 
Bosnia. 
  To this end the ministers also call for an intensified 
diplomatic effort by the international community, involving the 
United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia 
to ensure the convergence of their initiatives and to bring 
about talks between the parties at an early date based on the 
European Union plan and taking into account the Washington 
accord and the talks on the Krajinas.

  [Text] Luxembourg, 19 Apr (BELGA) -- The European Union 
[EU] will contribute ECU10 million to the establishment of the 
Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho following the 
decision of the European foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg 
today. 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes briefly reported on his 
meeting last Wednesday [13 April] with PLO leader 'Arafat at the 
Council of Europe in Strasbourg. 
  During that meeting Mr. 'Arafat had emphasized the need for 
quick and specific assistance for Gaza and Jericho, which will 
shortly have an independent Palestinian administration. 
According to a spokesman, 'Arafat asked for special assistance 
for the creation and the outfitting of the Palestinian police 
force. 
  The EU is ready to meet the Palestinian request by pledging 
ECU10 million. The ministers have agreed that this amount will 
be taken from the European budget.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU: European </F>
Employers (UNICE) Stress How Urgent It Is To Reach a Council 
Decision on Dual-Use Goods"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 15 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - UNICE [Union 
of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe], the 
spokesman for European business circles, has expressed concern 
about the delay by the Council of the [European] Union in 
defining a regime to be applied to "dual-use" goods and 
technologies (civilian and military). It is a known fact that 
the problem concerns exports of such goods towards third 
countries. Difficulties arise from the need to reconcile the 
free movement of goods in the market without borders with the 
control of certain "sensitive" exports towards a number of third 
countries. If there is no common regime, then goods and 
technologies which could be used for military purposes would 
leave the [EC] Community and cross countries which do not have 
sufficient controls. This issue has implications on the defence 
policy of Member States which makes it difficult to define what 
regime should be introduced. UNICE recalls its earlier 
suggestions for resolving this problem through "effective export 
controls" which are not detrimental to the competitiveness of 
European companies. It affirms: "Although the Council's work has 
since made considerable progress, UNICE regrets that it has not 
been concluded. Ministers of the Twelve still do not agree on a 
number of points, such as the `catch-all' clause (treatment of 
suspect customers), length of and measures applicable during the 
transition period, which are fundamental to the efficient 
operation of a European Union export control system. 
Consequently, UNICE calls on ministers to resolve the 
outstanding problems urgently. The abolition of the Coordinating 
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) on 31 March, 
which UNICE welcomes, makes the setting up of a European Union 
regime of export controls on dual-use goods and technologies all 
the more necessary. It would strengthen the European Union's 
position in the current negotiations related to the 
establishment of the New Forum in charge of defining the lists 
and procedures for future controls on dual-use products. For 
economic operators, cooperation between countries which have 
developed effective and reliable control regimes is essential to 
prevent distortions of competition both in Europe and with third 
countries. Lastly, at a time when the United States is reviewing 
its own exportcontrol regime, the European Union should seize 
the opportunity to show the way forward by putting in place an 
innovative system of export controls based on a licence-free 
European zone which could evolve in time into a licence-free 
zone at multilateral level, including the United States, Japan 
and any country which could meet the criteria defined in common. 
For all these reasons, UNICE stresses how urgent it is that 
decisions be taken."

<F P=106> [Article signed RAY/JDT: "Rwandan Patriotic Front To Support </F>
Departure of Belgian UN Troops"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 18 Apr (BELGA) -- RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] troops will do all they can to help the Belgian blue 
helmets remaining at Kigali airport depart, RPF spokesman 
Jean-Baptiste Nadhumba told BELGA. 
  Nadhumba said that he would have preferred the Belgians to 
continue their participation in the UN peacekeeping mission in 
Rwanda, but he expressed understanding for their departure. 
  According to the spokesman, the RPF has captured Byumba, 70 
km north of where a battalion of 4,000 Rwandan Armed Forces is 
located. The RPF reportedly also defeated government troops in 
Gabiro and Kagitumba.

<F P=106> [Commentary signed KVB: "United States Losing Bluff-Poker </F>
Against Serbs"] 
  [Text] Washington -- President Clinton bluffed and lost in 
Bosnia. Early last week, American NATO airplanes launched two 
air strikes on Serb positions. Officially, this was done to 
protect the UN staff, but the real message was that the Serbs 
should not seize Gorazde. Considering the unrelenting attacks 
against the Muslim enclave, the Serb commanders clearly failed 
to understand the message. 
  One week after the first attacks, Gorazde is still under 
fire. The UN threatened new air strikes, but Washington had 
already ruled out the possibility of a substantial extension of 
military actions from the start. The last few days, President 
Clinton tried very hard to convince the Serbs that the United 
States, the United Nations, and NATO are not taking sides in the 
conflict, and that NATO air strikes were not intended to change 
the military balance in favor of the Muslims. 
  The U.S. President and his advisers speculated that, 
following these very limited bombings, the Serbs would 
understand that the West is serious about its threats. This 
military message would prompt the Serbs to stop their military 
action in Gorazde, and to return to the negotiating table. 
  The message to the Serbs was enforced by comments in 
Washington, that the United States had crossed the Rubicon, and 
that there was no going back: Indeed, a superpower should live 
up to its commitments. In other words, if the Serbs ignored the 
warning, the United States would have to launch large-scale 
military operations. 
  The commentators were wrong. Apparently, Washington had not 
taken any strategic decision at all on the future course of 
action. The possibility that the Serbs would join the poker game 
had not been contemplated, or at least not sufficiently. The 
Americans had no answer to the taking of UN hostages and to the 
renewed attack on Gorazde. 
  The option of new air strikes was ruled out. First of all 
because the U.S. Government was concerned about the fate of the 
UN military. And second because of the disapproving reactions 
on the part of the Russians. The latter had strongly objected 
to the bombings, and had deferred their plans to join the 
Partnership for Peace in protest. The choice between Gorazde 
and future relations with Russia went against Gorazde. And most 
importantly, the United States had not crossed the Rubicon at 
all: Clinton was afraid of military escalation. 
  Once again, it became apparent that Washington has no policy 
at all, and that President Clinton's foreign policy is made up 
of a succession of ad hoc decisions which are not based on any 
coherent political concept. So the argument that a superpower 
should live up to its commitments so as not to lose its 
credibility turned out to be wrong. The policy pursued by this 
administration is anything but consistent: It can go back to 
square one without further ado. 
  There is a feeling of total malaise at the United Nations in 
New York. It was already a well-known fact that the Europeans 
are unable to take a military and political stand. Which is why 
the United Nations was increasingly hoping for U.S. leadership. 
Last year President Clinton lost credibility when he threatened 
action but backed out because the Europeans raised objections. 
  However, it looked as if he had learned from his mistakes. 
In recent months, the President repeatedly insisted that the 
West should not utter empty threats. Last February's ultimatum 
for Sarajevo was a success. After that, a few Serb fighter 
planes were shot down. The United States linked a new political 
initiative to the new determination, which led to a compromise 
between Muslims and Croats. To everyone's dismay, however, it 
is now revealed that the President lacks genuine interest in 
foreign policy, and that he walks out when things get too tough 
and dangerous. 
  American public opinion has not woken up, yet. This is 
mainly because there are no American UN soldiers in Bosnia. In 
addition, President Clinton has not taken the trouble, so far, 
to explain to the American public why the Balkan states are so 
important to the United States. 
  The political experts are divided. Many believe that the 
United States should stay out of the hotbed because there are no 
explicit U.S. interests at stake. Former Secretary of State 
Eagleburger argues that the political will to play an active 
political and military role is lacking. However, according to 
Eagleburger and many other foreign experts, not only Bosnia is 
at stake, but also U.S. credibility as a superpower. 
Superpowers should not be soft, and certainly not utter empty 
threats. Once the United States has decided to take military 
action, it should deal heavy blows and not hesitate to bomb 
Belgrade, for instance. 
  The antiquated bombs which were dropped by the F-16 fighter 
planes last Sunday and Monday hit one tank and barely left a few 
deep holes in the ground. However, they caused serious 
political damage which goes far beyond Bosnia's interests. 
North Korea must have observed with interest and relief that 
U.S. threats need not be taken too seriously. If the Serbs can 
make a fool of the United States, there is no reason for North 
Korea to assume that the United States would take a tougher 
stand against Pyongyang, and that it would stake everything to 
keep North Korea from producing nuclear arms.

<F P=106> [Article by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd: "A World </F>
Role for a Great Power"] 
  [Text] A debate has been stirred up in Russia which 
closely affects British interests. Not a debate generated by 
the revanchist views of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- Russian 
soldiers washing their boots in the Indian Ocean, nuclear 
weapons dispatched with abandon. But a broader debate, about how 
a country which used to be locked in superpower confrontation 
should adapt to its changed circumstances, now that the Cold War 
is over and the Soviet Union has collapsed. 
  Dean Acheson's pithy one-liner on post-imperial Britain -- 
losing an Empire without yet finding a role -- has echoes in 
Moscow. It took Britain three decades to transform Empire into 
Commonwealth. The Russians lost their empire in three years. 
  William Hayter was and remains an acute observer of the 
scene. He was right when he wrote, in this paper some weeks ago, 
that "Russia today is in the same position internationally as 
Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, a Great Power like 
another, likely to play its part...in the concert of Europe." 
  It is natural that Russia should want to act as the great 
power it is. But there are limits, too, to those actions. The 
government today is aware of popular constituencies which were 
less obvious before the December elections. There have been 
changes in the cabinet, and the government now is working to 
match those changes in political circumstances with its foreign 
policy priorities. For all of us in the West, that debate 
produces both problems and opportunities. 
  The Russian role in Bosnia has been valuable. A more 
vigorous and lateral-minded policy brought Russian troops from 
Croatia into Sarajevo. That buttressed the ultimatum which NATO 
had the previous week issued to Serb militia in the hills around 
the city. It reinforced the admirable efforts of General Sir 
Michael Rose to secure the cease-fire around Sarajevo. Three 
efforts -- one by the UN commander, one by NATO members, one by 
the Russian Government -- together brought stability and a 
certain amount of sanity to Sarajevo. The Russians, together 
with the rest of us, could not achieve success at Gorazde. But, 
looking ahead in Bosnia, we can see that the Russians are now an 
essential part of the international effort. 
  There are other parts of Europe, however, where Russia's 
activity appears dubious or unacceptable. I recently visited 
Riga for talks with the three Baltic foreign ministers. Russian 
troops have already left Lithuania. Russia has undertaken to 
withdraw its troops from Latvia by the end of August, and was 
quick to correct its mistaken announcement recently which gave a 
different impression. The Russians are engaged in negotiations 
with Estonia to withdraw their remaining 2,600 troops, having 
also set a date for withdrawal: the end of August. 
  I recognise the importance to Moscow of the Russian 
communities in the Baltic states. It is important that their 
rights are respected. But there is a basic fact that overrides 
all others. These countries are sovereign. They have a right, 
as independent states, to ask any foreign troops to go. This is 
not something to which conditions can be attached. So the 
August withdrawal dates from Latvia and Estonia must be kept, 
since that is what both countries wish. We accept that Russia 
has interests, both economic and political, in other parts of 
the former Soviet Union. But these countries, no less than the 
Baltic states, are sovereign and independent. They, too, are 
entitled to ask the Russians to withdraw their troops; Moldova 
has already asked. Equally, they are free to enter into 
bilateral agreements with Russia on the stationing of forces, 
and other issues, should they wish to do so. The key is freedom 
of choice. This is something the Russians must respect, and 
something we shall watch very carefully. 
  Conflicts in the former Soviet Union are a legitimate 
concern 
for Russia, but also for Britain and the international community 
as a whole. We welcome Russian participation in UN and CSCE 
efforts to bring about peace settlements to the conflicts in the 
Transcaucasus. There are no special "spheres of influence." We 
need to work together on this. But the British Government will 
not underwrite any proposal to deploy Russian forces in the 
former Soviet Union unless we are sure that peacekeeping forces 
will not turn into occupiers. Andrey Kozyrev (the Russian 
foreign minister) and I have thought hard about and jointly 
described in public the kind of ground rules which should 
dictate our responses to this kind of situation. We agreed that 
respect for the sovereignty and wishes of these newly 
independent states is central to the whole issue. We agreed 
that any peacekeeping operation needs a parallel peace process, 
a clear mandate for the forces sent in, and a clear exit 
strategy once the mandate has been fulfilled. 
  Between now and the Russian presidential elections in 1996, 
Britain and Europe must find ways of accentuating the positive 
side of the new Russian engagement in international affairs, as 
in Bosnia. As part of that, we need to find ways of helping the 
Russian Government to convince its own electorate that this is 
the wise and right approach. 
  Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace would 
make a big difference. We are keen that Russia should play a 
full and active part in this initiative. There is clearly a 
great deal it can contribute, not least in involvement in the 
peacekeeping-related activities envisaged under PFP [Partnership 
For Peace]. Working closely with NATO in this way could do a 
lot to build up understanding and co-operation, not only between 
Russia and NATO but across the whole of Europe. 
  The Russian leadership and the Russian people have come to a 
crucial point. They are debating among themselves what kind of 
foreign policy they should pursue. I have no doubt that they 
should be pursuing the policy of a great power -- but a great 
power within the context of international law and norms. We 
must watch to ensure that Russian policy conforms to these 
criteria. There are plenty of voices in Russia urging, against 
powerful opposition, the kind of foreign policy which fits in 
well with our own and with the needs of their neighbours. We 
must help them.

<F P=106> [Bruce CLark article: "Idealism Gives Way to </F>
Disenchantment"] 
  [Text] Rarely can an empire have risen or declined so 
rapidly. The number of soldiers wearing the blue helmets of the 
United Nations has soared over the past four years from 10,000 
to 70,000. The number of man-hours devoted to UN matters by 
generals and politicians in the world's leading powers has 
ballooned: woe betide the ambitious diplomat who cannot master 
its baffling acronyms. 
  But the fall of Gorazde, the so-called safe haven for 
Moslems 
in eastern Bosnia, should quash any remaining temptation to 
regard the gaunt skyscraper on New York's East River as 
headquarters of a world government in embryo. 
  It seems a long time since mid-1992 when Mr Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, the UN secretary-general sought to raise the 
body's profile with his ideas for preventing civil wars, 
cross-border conflict and humanitarian disasters. 
  In Bosnia, at least, the UN now faces the worst of all 
possible worlds. It has unleashed its most powerful weapon -- 
air strikes against the Serbs, and failed to achieve either the 
protection of its own personnel or the preservation of the 
haven. The UN is thus neither an effective belligerent nor a 
credible honest broker. Even its role as a distributor of aid 
has been compromised. In recent days the UN has experienced 
another setback, where the human consequences are worse and the 
failure more complete: the orgy of blood-letting in Rwanda, 
where Belgium, the linch-pin of a peacekeeping effort, is 
scrambling to pull out. 
  The organisation's bureaucrats and soldiers may justifiably 
argue that neither failure was their fault -- they were given 
inadequate resources and incoherent mandates. But that will not 
stop blame accruing to the UN and its secretary-general. Just 
as the UN may once have been a convenient vehicle for the 
strategic ambitions of member states, it will now serve as a 
convenient scapegoat for their failures. 
  Mr Butrus-Ghali, already a bete noire among the Serbs and 
their traditional allies in Russia for ordering air strikes, now 
faces calls for his resignation from Moslem countries because 
the strikes patently did not work. 
  His humiliation in Bosnia is not so much a turning point as 
a 
landmark in a process that began last autumn with a precipitous 
decline in the UN's popularity in the U.S., which remains the 
principal paymaster and was the main architect of its rise in 
status. 
  Mr Bill Clinton once gushed with enthusiasm for the UN. As a 
U.S. presidential candidate, he backed the idea of a standing 
"rapid deployment force" whose brief showed a touching faith in 
the solubility of conflict. It would guard borders, prevent 
atrocities against civilians, distribute aid and deter terrorism. 
  The onset of disenchantment is not hard to pinpoint. It 
began last August, when the first U.S. soldiers were killed in 
Somalia, and it became total on October 3, when 18 Americans 
died in Mogadishu. 
  The UN fell even further out of fashion when the U.S. ships 
dispatched to Haiti a few days later, with a UN mandate to 
restore democracy, failed even to land. Knocking the UN, and 
pledging that U.S. soldiers should never be subordinated to the 
incompetent foreigners, was an irresistible temptation for U.S. 
politicians. Squabbling over the U.S. role in the UN has led to 
long delays in the publication, now expected this week, of a 
presidential directive on the deployment of troops abroad. 
  The degeneration of the UN's relief effort in Somalia into 
an 
ugly shooting war was not the first disaster. But Mogadishu was 
the first televised fiasco. According to Dr Mats Berdal, a 
Norwegian political scientist and authority on peacekeeping, the 
loss of nerve in Somalia shows that "U.S. policy is flawed by 
swings between idealism and overhasty disappointment." 
  Europeans have often discerned the same contradiction in 
U.S. 
policy towards Bosnia as they saw in Somalia -- the same 
yearning for solutions that are both effective and risk-free. 
Air strikes, when combined with the enticing word surgical, 
seemed to offer that combination: they would punish wrongdoers 
and bring instant results without risking American lives. 
  As experience has shown, this was a false hope. Few people 
understand that better than General Sir Michael Rose, the UN 
commander in Bosnia. He is well-qualified to discern 
theoretical flaws in the UN operation: a disastrous muddle over 
vocabulary. In his previous role as commandant of the British 
Army Staff College, he sponsored a revival of research into the 
theory of peacekeeping. He insisted on the distinction between 
peace-broking, peacekeeping (guarding a peace to which all 
parties have agreed) and enforcing peace against the will of 
some of the parties. 
  The UN -- or its leading members -- failed to observe that 
distinction when they drew up the mandate for the former 
Yugoslavia and allocated money and personnel. To impose peace 
against the will of any party, the UN would have needed far more 
firepower on the ground that members were prepared to commit. 
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, openly expressed 
his frustration in New York last week. He described as 
"difficult to understand" the U.S. refusal to finance let alone 
staff -- an increased ground force in Bosnia. "We must not put 
ourselves in the situation where we lack the tools to carry out 
the job," he said. 
  Ironically, the outbreak of recrimination over UN failure 
has come as the much-maligned bureaucracy in New York is finally 
becoming streamlined. The Department for Peace-Keeping 
Operations has under the galvanising effect of the Bosnian 
crisis, started to work more effectively. Gone are the days 
when UN commanders in Bosnia would complain that nobody in New 
York worked weekends. Insiders say the department has become 
better at the things it can realistically -- do gathering 
information, planning for future requirements, exercising broad 
control over finance and personnel -- and better at delegating 
to commanders in the field the operational control that it 
cannot realistically exercise. 
  It would be ironic if these improvements -- initiated during 
Mr Clinton's early period of U.S. enthusiasm for the UN -- were 
now wasted because of a politically inspired witch-hunt. The 
president's love affair with the organisation began in the 
immediate aftermath of the cold war, when it was tempting to 
believe that all world problems could be jointly managed by the 
West and a compliant Russia. 
  The fact that Russia has now broken ranks with the West over 
Bosnia -- by denouncing the air strikes against the Serbs -- 
probably sets the seal on that period of optimism. 
  Now Russia is trying to do what the U.S., in a sense, failed 
to do -- turn the UN into an instrument of its own policies. It 
is pressing hard for the UN's blessing, and above all for UN 
finance, for the maintenance of Russian forces in the unstable 
southern republics of the CIS. Here again, it will be essential 
to bear in mind the distinctions on which Gen Rose insists if 
the UN wants to avoid fresh blows to its credibility. 
  The Russian word for peacekeeping -- mirotvorcheskiy -- 
means 
making peace, establishing peace in a situation where none 
exists. And Moscow's approaches to the establishment of peace 
have not, in practice, been hemmed by any of the squeamishness 
about taking sides, or taking casualties, or observing legal 
niceties. 
  Western diplomats at the UN are thinking hard about the 
terms 
on which they could give the organisation's blessing to a mainly 
Russian peacekeeping operation in the Black Sea war zone of 
Abkhazia, where Georgian Government forces were routed last 
summer. 
  Having approved a UN resolution that made possible the 
Western air strikes against the Serbs, Russia will from now on 
be more careful about how it uses its vote in the Security 
Council: it will not permit any more ambiguous mandates. The 
U.S., UK and France will in turn be more careful about giving 
carte blanche to Russia. 
  That could mean a partial return to the cold war days when 
East and West continually vetoed one another's resolutions -- 
and place further obstacles in the path of the blue helmets.

<F P=106> [David Wastell and Toby Helm report: "I'll Share Power With </F>
Unionists, Says Reynolds"] 
  [Text] Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, last night 
sketched out a plan for a united Ireland in which Ulster 
Unionists would be guaranteed a share in the government. 
  As London and Dublin began a two-pronged attempt to 
revitalise the stalled peace process, Mr Reynolds sought to send 
a conciliatory message to the Unionists. 
  He said his own party, Fianna Fail, and the Ulster Unionist 
Party were the two largest parties in Ireland, and both had a 
responsibility to seek to "free our people from the present 
violent situation -- and to join in developing a better future 
for us all in the land we love." 
  Speaking at a Fianna Fail conference in Dublin -- attended, 
for the first time, by a Unionist representative, Belfast 
councillor Michael McGimpsey -- Mr Reynolds said he did not 
believe unilateral British withdrawal from the North was the 
answer. 
  "On the contrary, there would be a very real danger of 
communal violence and the type of violent community upheaval or 
worse which has characterised the political situation at 
intervals in the past," he said. "That is a scenario which must 
never be allowed to happen again." 
  Realistically, a united Ireland by consent was a long-term 
goal, said Mr Reynolds, but both Unionists and nationalists 
could play an important part in governing the whole of Ireland. 
"I personally would be prepared to provide a guaranteed 30 per 
cent of places in an enlarged government -- and throughout the 
public sector -- for as long as was necessary, to members of the 
two communities in the North in proportion to their respective 
population, in accordance with systems that have been developed 
on parts of the European Continent." 
  But Unionists were last night angered that Mr Reynolds had 
reopened the prospect of a united Ireland. The Rev Martin 
Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast and foreign affairs 
spokesman, said they would reject Mr Reynolds's offer "out of 
hand." It goes against the constitutional beliefs of all 
Unionists. 
  "I cannot think of anyone who would support it in the 
community."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to a spokesman, the Federal 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] does not yet 
know any details about the circumstances that led to the death 
of a BfV official and his wife in Libya. The BfV spokesman 
affirmed on Tuesday [19 April] that the terrorism expert and his 
wife were found with serious injuries in Libya on 10 March, two 
days after he had entered the country by car. On 9 April, a few 
days after his wife's death, the BfV official died of his 
injuries in a hospital near Tripoli. 
  As the spokesman added, the official had told his office 
that 
he would go on a five-week vacation to Cairo. Since the 
beginning of the 1970's he had taken various vacation trips to 
Arab countries. He also knew that the BfV prohibits any trip to 
Libya. 
  Bonn security circles called it unlikely that official 
Libyan 
bodies might have been involved in the death of the BfV 
official. This would contradict the efforts of the Libyan state 
leaders for good relations with the FRG. In addition, it is 
assumed that in such a case it would have been theoretically 
possible to make the German official "disappear." The fact that 
the injured couple was not robbed of any valuables and that 
their car was found undamaged speaks against a robbery. 
Perhaps, the Germans were involved in a conflict for a so far 
unknown reason. 
  Speculations that the official was doing research on his own 
-- perhaps regarding the bomb attack on the Pan-Am plane in 1988 
over Lockerbie -- have been called "absurd and pure 
imagination." There are "other and more effective ways" to do 
that, it was said.

  [Text] Hamburg, April 17 (CTK) -- A two-day working 
meeting between Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and his 
German counterpart Volker Ruehe ended in Hamburg today. 
  The ministers discussed the security aspects of recent 
developments in Europe, above all in the former Yugoslavia, and 
a plan for cooperation between the Czech and German armies to 
consist of 36 joint operations. 
  They also talked about the attitude of Russia to the 
Partnership for Peace project and to developments in Bosnia. 
"The situation is complicated by the fact that Russia as a 
superpower would like to have some sort of special status within 
the Partnership, and would also like to take a share in common 
responsibility for the security of Europe," Baudys told CTK. 
  With Russia having expressed dissatisfaction at the most 
recent events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, a situation 
had arisen where all sides should put their cards on the table 
and speak openly, he said. 
  The point of issue had to be the original decision of the UN 
Security Council, which had given the mandate to NATO troops. 
Russia playing a larger part in international negotiations on 
the former Yugoslavia would mean a change in the agreed 
approach, said the defense minister. 
  He praised the performance of Czech soldiers serving in the 
former Yugoslavia in UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] 
units, saying they were some of the best there. 
  Ruehe told CTK he valued the intensive and regular dialogue 
with representatives of the Czech Army. The next meeting is to 
take place in Prague in six months' time. 
  Today Baudys left Hamburg for Munster. From there he will 
continue to Bonn, which he is visiting at the invitation of the 
Konrad Adenauer Foundation, close to the German Christian 
Democratic Union (CDU). Baudys belongs to the Czech Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL).

  [Text] Hamburg, April 16 (CTK) -- It was decided that the 
German and Czech Defense Ministers would meet regularly every 
six months to discuss developments in European and global 
security. 
  Some 144 Czech officers have received or are receiving 
training at military colleges in Germany, said Jaromir Novotny, 
head of the Foreign Relations Section of the Ministry of 
Defense. Joint training courses are under consideration and the 
first joint exercise of staff officers from both armies is 
planned for autumn, he said. 
  Czech soldiers exercised together with Dutch troops in 
March, 
and in July a Czech-French staff officers exercise has been 
scheduled, he said. The aim is for the Czech Army to acquire 
the skills necessary for joint military peacekeeping operations, 
he said. 
  General Karel Pezl, adviser to the Defense Ministry, told 
CTK 
the Czech Army was undergoing a very complex transformation 
process in which the method of leadership was being altered, 
military service shortened from 18 months to one year, and the 
240,000-strong army reduced by a quarter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Michel </F>
Colomes; place and date not given: "France Put to the Test"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Bosnia </H5>
  [Colomes] If there really is a Serbian offensive against 
Gorazde, why do we just have symbolic, selective, and limited 
air strikes? 
  [Juppe] The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] response has 
been 
in proportion to the threat. I should note in passing that the 
UN procedures have been improved, as France requested, since the 
time between the request for intervention and the final decision 
has been reduced to less than half an hour, rather than over 
four hours as was the case in Bihac. 
  [Colomes] What action would we take if the Serbs do not 
yield 
on the ground and continued their offensive? Are you certain 
that these air strikes will be effective? 
  [Juppe] That is an old dispute. We have been told 
alternatively that these strikes are completely ineffective and 
that they are a miracle cure. I do not believe them to be 
either. They are necessary to clearly illustrate the resolve of 
the international community, but they are not a durable 
solution. It is a way of reacting. The only stable solution is 
a political and diplomatic one. What worries me, in the current 
situation, is the risk of escalation and the delays caused to 
negotiations. 
  [Colomes] Why was no ultimatum issued, as in Sarajevo? 
  [Juppe] Because the conditions were already in place for 
NATO 
intervention. The decision was undoubtedly made because of the 
urgency of the situation. Now we must, I repeat, return to 
diplomacy. The method of bilateral contacts used for the last 
month and a half, first by the Americans and then by the 
Russians, has proved useful. It has made it possible to arrive 
at an agreement between Croats and Muslims, and to establish a 
cease fire between them that has been respected. However, we 
are starting to see the limits of this method. Today it is 
clear: You cannot make peace between two sides when three sides 
are involved in the conflict. What France is asking for now is 
that we get everyone, including the Serbs, around the 
negotiating table: the three protagonists plus the major 
powers, without whom there will be no solution. 
  [Colomes] So you want to reconcile the American diplomatic 
process and the European one? 
  [Juppe] Absolutely. The only overall proposal that currently 
exists is the European action plan. 
  [Colomes] Are the two plans -- the American plan and the 
European plan -- compatible? 
  [Juppe] That is a question I have asked Warren Christopher a 
number of times, and I have been assured that they are 
compatible. If you read the two texts you can see for yourself: 
The Muslim-Croat agreement does not contradict the European 
plan. We must therefore view the various initiatives in an 
overall perspective. Specifically, France wants to include the 
Americans and the Russians in the London conference, in addition 
to the European Union and the United Nations. The recent 
Owen-Stoltenberg-Redman-Churkin meeting was a first step in this 
direction. I think that this is the only way to say to the 
three parties on the ground: This is the joint position of the 
major powers, and here is what we are asking, starting with a 
cease fire between Serbs and Muslims to avoid an escalation of 
the Gorazde conflict. 
  [Colomes] The Muslims refuse a cease fire because they think 
they are in a difficult military position, and would rather 
continue fighting.... 
  [Juppe] We cannot accept that. If we did, we would get 
caught up in a downward spiral where the United Nations and the 
Atlantic Alliance would be supporting the Sarajevo government's 
attempts to regain lost ground. President Clinton himself 
recently said much the same thing. 
  We prefer discussion to confrontation. We know that, in 
Gorazde, the first attack came from the Muslim side, and the 
Serbs then responded wholly disproportionately, as is their 
custom. We cannot be held hostage to that game. We must say so 
now, and all four of us (Europeans, Americans, Russians, and the 
United Nations) must say it with one voice. 
  [Colomes] To bring the Serbs back around the negotiating 
table, should we not try to alter the terms of the embargo? 
  [Juppe] That is the second argument in favor of a return to 
the European action plan, since this plan links the process of 
finding a political solution with, first, the suspension and, 
second, the lifting of sanctions against Serbia. We need a big 
stick -- the ultimatum put to Serbia was an example of this -- 
but we also need a carrot. 
  [Colomes] On the subject of air strikes in Gorazde, why did 
you not inform the Russians? 
  [Juppe] The Russians voted for resolution 836 on safe areas. 
They have contingents on the ground under UNPROFOR command, and 
it was in this context that the decision was made. There does 
not seem to me to be anything there that could offend them. On 
the other hand, I do think we should involve the Russians more 
in the peace process. That is why France proposes placing 
everyone -- belligerents and major powers -- around the one 
table. 
<H5>  China </H5>
  [Colomes] You have just accompanied the prime minister on a 
delicate trip to China, in the course of which the Chinese 
authorities seemed to take pleasure in strewing your path with 
obstacles -- increasing the number of arrests, taking people 
into custody, detentions, and placing dissidents in guarded 
accommodation. Since the American secretary of state had 
already fallen pray to a similar series of events, could you not 
have foreseen this risk and taken preventive measures? 
  [Juppe] The only way to prevent it would have been by not 
going. That would have meant remaining in the same position as 
before, with China and France not talking to each other. When I 
became foreign minister, one year ago, relations had virtually 
been broken off. Let me just give you one example: Our 
ambassador at the time, one of our best diplomats and a fluent 
Chinese-speaker, no longer had any contact with the Chinese 
ministries. We had reached an advanced state of sulking. Can 
you imagine France having no dialogue with a power such as 
China? Maybe some people were resigned to that fact, but I was 
not. As a result, we did everything we could -- and it was a 
long process -- to restore dialogue. In China, I felt that the 
authorities wanted to reestablish contacts and I did not at all 
have the feeling that they were making things more difficult. 
As a result, the trip was successful. Quite possibly, it was 
not to the liking of all the Chinese factions or the people 
observing China's relations with the rest of the world. It is 
quite possible, too, that there were struggles for influence 
which led to the measures you described. However, I would like 
to add two things. 
  First, we did not hide what we felt. We told the Chinese 
very clearly what we thought of the human rights situation in 
their country. We did not do it publicly at the microphone, but 
our message did get across. 
  Second, with regard to the arrests, it is hard to see 
clearly 
what is was all about. When we arrived in Shanghai, press 
agency dispatches spoke of "arrests." We immediately asked the 
Chinese authorities for explanations. I myself summoned the 
Chinese ambassador to France and told him: "I want an answer 
within a few hours." The answer duly came, in the form of a 
clear commitment from the Chinese minister accompanying Mr. 
Balladur: no dissidents had been imprisoned since our arrival. 
  [Colomes] They were playing word games. They had not 
imprisoned them, they had simply detained them in police 
stations and released them the day after you left.... 
  [Juppe] XINHUA itself confirmed, on the day we left, that no 
0one had been arrested and that everyone taken in for 
questioning had been released. 
  I think it is quite interesting that so much attention is 
being paid to human rights in China. When we go to the Arab 
countries which apply the Shariah, does anyone ask questions 
about women's rights? When we go to Vietnam, is anyone quite as 
interested in human rights there? I could list all the 
countries in the world where the human rights situation is not 
what it should be. France speaks out when this is the case, and 
we told China. Everything else is an exaggeration or 
manipulation. 
  [Colomes] Was it not a kind of confession of weakness on our 
part to go to Beijing after having done a kind of about-turn by 
abandoning Taiwan? Did we not have a stronger position in the 
past, when we balanced relations between China and Taiwan? 
  [Juppe] Who says we have abandoned Taiwan? That is not true. 
Our cooperation, especially in the civil domain, remains 
promising. However, we have to reestablish political dialogue 
with Beijing, especially where North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam, 
and regional security issues are concerned. These are very 
important issues. We cannot cut ourselves off from a country 
like China because of them. Let me explain about Taiwan: We 
simply said that we would observe the required restraint in arms 
deliveries and that we would stop supplying Taiwan with weapons 
that could endanger China. It is the least we can do! 
<H5>  Rwanda </H5>
  [Colomes] Now that we have completed, and succeeded, 
evacuating French nationals from Rwanda, are we going to let the 
inhabitants of that country continue killing each other? 
  [Juppe] Is France the policeman for the whole universe? Does 
France have the means and the responsibility for preventing 
people from killing each other all over the planet? 
  [Colomes] Perhaps not France alone, but the United Nations? 
  [Juppe] The United Nations has tried, and so has France. For 
years, we have been working for the reconciliation of the 
various factions. We supported the Arusha agreement and had a 
military contingent in the country for months. We only pulled 
our troops out last year when the UN forces arrived. We thought 
that the peace process was working. Then there was the attack 
on the aircraft carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi 
which led to the current conflagration. Clearly, our duty was 
to evacuate French nationals, and we did that, coolly and 
quickly. Now we have to rebuild the conditions for dialogue and 
give the United Nations back its role. We will work toward this. 
<H5>  Algeria </H5>
  [Colomes] In Algeria, which is sinking into civil war, a new 
government team has taken office.... 
  [Juppe] Yes, but it is still too early to talk about it 
because it is difficult to interpret the significance of General 
Zeroual's latest cabinet reshuffle. What line will the new 
government take? We will see when we know the composition of 
this government, especially for two important posts: the 
interior (will the hard line be maintained?) and finance (will 
discussions continue with the International Monetary Fund?). 
  [Colomes] What will we do if the situation in Algeria gets 
worse? Are we ready to welcome anyone who wants to enter France? 
  [Juppe] Of course, we will welcome French nationals. We have 
already repatriated some two-thirds of our nationals in Algeria. 
Then there are those people with dual nationality who hold a 
French passport. 
  Beyond that, we have to examine the question clearly: Can 
and must French society today open its doors to tens of 
thousands -- and the figure could run into hundreds of thousands 
-- of Algerians who potentially have dual nationality but who do 
not currently hold a French passport, or even to refugees? 
Generosity and fine sentiments are one thing, but the reality 
of the social balance in France also counts for a lot. I do not 
think that France could today open its doors to thousands of 
immigrants from North Africa. There are other countries we could 
call on to show their solidarity, such as Algeria's neighbors or 
other Mediterranean countries. France cannot do everything on 
its own. 
  [Colomes] Faced with this crisis, does France feel that it 
has been abandoned somewhat by its traditional allies? 
  [Juppe] France feels it is alone. It is true, it feels it is 
in the front line. We are trying to do two things: First, 
convince certain of our partners that, even if political 
dialogue is necessary, the arrival of an extremist, anti-French, 
anti-European, anti-Western regime in Algeria would threaten the 
balance of the whole region. There would inevitably be a 
contagious effect on the other countries of the Maghreb and 
maybe beyond. 
  Second, we are trying to encourage the Algerian people to 
restructure their economy and we are looking to mobilize 
international aid to help them do this. As soon as the dinar 
has been devalued and the IMF agreement signed, Algeria's debt 
must be rescheduled and the European countries, and others, too, 
if possible -- I have called on Japan, Algeria's second largest 
creditor -- must do everything they can to lessen Algeria's debt 
burden, which is completely stifling the economy. 
<H5>  Russia </H5>
  [Colomes] Can you see a hardening in Russian foreign policy 
since the election of the new Duma? 
  [Juppe] Yes, but without doubt these hesitations or 
contradictions are related to the complexity of the Russian 
political landscape. Just think about what happened in the 
former Yugoslavia: One day people were shooting their mouths 
off, the next day they were calming things down. Thus, there is 
certainly the need for President Yeltsin and his government to 
take account of the rise in nationalist feeling, including in 
the Duma, but, at the same time, they want to continue their 
cooperation and partnership with the West. 
  [Colomes] Should we alter our attitude to cater for their 
new 
position? 
  [Juppe] I am one of those people who think that we should 
help Russia, not isolate it. We have to tell them a few home 
truths, however. First, about human rights and democracy. 
People are talking about them in China, so let us also talk 
about them in Russia. The state of law has made progess with 
the December legislative elections and referendum, but there is 
still more to be done. Second, we must tell them: "We will 
help you, but on certain conditions." We are not prepared to 
throw our money down the drain, and aid can only be effective if 
economic reforms are implemented in Russia. Third, we are not 
ready to give Russia the right to veto what is happening in 
Central and East Europe. For what the Russians call the "near 
abroad," we will readily recognize a certain responsibility that 
falls to Russia, but on condition that this responsibility is 
met within the framework of the United Nations or the CSCE. We 
will not be writing them any blank checks. I think that these 
three truths should be expressed in a context of political 
openness and free cooperation. That is what I intend to say 
when I go to Russia in May.

<F P=106> [Octavi Marti report: "Aznar Says That `All Bounds of What </F>
Is Tolerable and Permissible' Have Been Overstepped"] 
  [Text] Paris -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar 
stated in Paris yesterday that "all the bounds of what is 
tolerable and permissible have been overstepped" in Spain, 
referring to the scandals involving former prominent officials. 
Aznar, who met in the French capital with Gaullist Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur, avoided centering his remarks on 
specific individuals, but pointed to Felipe Gonzalez in saying 
that the bounds have also been breached in "the evasion of 
responsibilities by those people who hold the greatest 
responsibility." 
  As he said later, the People's Party leader forecast to 
Balladur an imminent political change in Spain: "As is natural, 
I conveyed my impressions and thoughts," he said at the end of 
the 20-minute meeting, because "we are approaching a stage when 
one political period will end and a new one will begin." 
<H5>  Own Initiative </H5>
  That interpretation of the Spanish situation, he said, "was 
not requested of me by Prime Minister Balladur; I gave it to him 
on my own initiative." In addition to the Spanish political 
situation, the exchange of views with the French prime minister 
"was lively and interesting," according to Aznar, who was 
accompanied by Abel Matutes, the People's Party list leader for 
the European elections and commissioner for transport and energy 
in Brussels. 
  "The European Union, the current political and economic 
state 
of Europe, the Maghreb, and bilateral relations between our two 
countries," with particular reference to cooperation in the 
antiterrorist struggle, were discussed during the conversation. 
Aznar described the situation in this respect as "good right 
now," but said that it is desirable "to deepen it in order to 
make it increasingly effective." 
  For Balladur, the meeting with Aznar had a less ceremonial 
and more practical aspect, embodied in the presence of European 
Commissioner Matutes, who, it is hoped, will intervene in favor 
of the Air France restructuring and recapitalization plan. 
  Proof of the French Government's interest in exchanging 
views 
with Matutes is the fact that, early in the afternoon, the 
Spanish representative in Brussels met again with Balladur, with 
the latter now accompanied by Transport Minister Bernard Bosson. 
  For his part, Jose Maria Aznar announced that he intended to 
meet again with the French prime minister in the evening, in the 
course of a "private wdding reception."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Scalfaro Urges eAnti-Fascist Values </F>
in Florence Visit"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Florence, April 17 -- Italian President 
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro urged Italians to remember the values 
expressed in the War of Liberation to free the country of Nazism 
and Fascism, when he visited this Tuscan capital today to open 
celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of victory against the 
Fascist regime. 
  After visiting the buildings gutted by a bomb on May 27 last 
year with the death of five, Scalfaro attended a rally this 
afternoon in Piazza della Signoria, the city's main square since 
its birth and rise to celebrity as the capital of the 
Renaissance, telling a crowd of thousands that historical truth 
must not be tampered with. "In this case, the truth is history, 
and we can't make history as we would have liked it to be," he 
said. "We must learn our lesson from history, which cannot be 
changed, from sacrifice for the Liberation...." 
  His remarks fell at a time of great debate about the 
continued significance of the struggle against the Fascist 
regime as the source of the values on which the Italian republic 
is founded and proposals from the new conservative majority in 
parliament for reforming the republic's foundations. 
  "We therefore appeal to history and our memories in order 
not 
to forget since the testimony of those who died for liberty must 
also be the commitment of each of us," Scalfaro added. 
  According to some analysts, foremost in his mind may have 
been on the documentary footage of Italy's Liberation during 
World War II shown recently on RAI's [Italian State-Owned 
Broadcasting Company] flagship First Channel. 
  The screenings of mostly new material shot by U.S. film 
crews 
was accompanied by a commentary and debate in the studio in 
which many people saw a neofascist spokesman as being allowed to 
whitewash the historical truth of dictator Benito Mussolini's 
regime. The footage was aired just as the conservative 
coalition of the federalist Northern League and Silvio 
Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia with the neofascist 
National Alliance took a parliamentary majority in the March 
27-28 election. At the same time, National Alliance leader 
Gianfranco Fini claimed in an interview that Mussolini was the 
"greatest statesman of the century." 
  According to some analysts, Scalfaro may decide to delay 
naming a premier-designate, presumably Berlusconi, until after 
the annual celebrations for the Liberation on April 25, to avoid 
what promises, this year, to be a massive and highly committed 
turnout becoming a demonstration against the media 
mogul-turned-politician's nomination to lead the new government. 
  "Unity, harmony, and concord must be achieved," urged 
Scalfaro, "because a people can only move if it is capable of 
drawing from history lessons of peace and justice, not lessons 
of hate and revenge." 
  Opening his speech, Scalfaro also said he had nothing to add 
to what had already been said by Florence Mayor Giorgio Morales, 
who asserted that no question-marks could be raised over values 
such as "Italian unity, liberty, and democracy, asserted by the 
struggle for Liberation from Nazi-Fascism." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Speroni Sees New Role in League, </F>
Old Habits in Others"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Milan, April 17 -- A leading Northern League 
official, Francesco Speroni, warned here today that, in recent 
political negotiations, he had seen his party's putative 
government allies of Forza Italia and the National Alliance 
using Christian Democrat-style methods he thought were "dead and 
buried." 
  Speroni, who was the League's initial candidate for the 
Senate speakership, said he welcomed the election of the 
conservative Freedom Front's candidate, Carlo Scognamiglio, but 
frowned on how the candidacy had been achieved by the League's 
allies. 
  In particular, he said no one had ever suggested he should 
withdraw his name. He also said the choice fell on Scognamiglio 
largely thanks to the League, since "even" Forza Italia's leader 
Silvio Berlusconi looked kindly on the candidacy of outgoing 
speaker, Giovanni Spadolini, who was backed by the progressives. 
  Speroni told reporters at his home near here that he had 
heard it was President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who had vetoed his 
candidacy for the Senate. He added that he was standing by his 
refusal to take part in the League's delegation for the 
government-formation negotiations that expected to get under way 
next week. "I'll be sending a deputy," he said. 
  "Maybe, I've come to the end of a political season in the 
League," said Speroni, who is usually ranked as among League 
leader Umberto Bossi's closest aides. "I am not a politician 
for mediation, but one for opposition or an absolute majority. 
I may have to review my role in the League."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "League To Run Alone in Lombard </F>
Administrative Elections"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Milan, April 18 -- The Lombard League will 
not seek alliances with anyone in the June 12 administrative 
elections to be held in several municipalities of the Lombardy 
region, a top party official announced Monday [18 April]. 
  "We take it for granted that we'll be running alone in some 
municipalities at the administrative elections," said Luigi 
Negri, national secretary of the Lombard League, the regional 
branch of the Northern League. 
  The decision would thus rule out presenting joint candidates 
with Forza Italia, the Northern League's ally in the March 27-28 
general elections. 
  Municipalities scheduled to go to the polls include Como, 
Sesto San Giovanni, Abbiategrasso, Melegnano, Cernusco sul 
Naviglio and Rho.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Di Donato, Ex-Socialist Deputy </F>
Chief, Arrested"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Naples, April 16 -- Naples police on Saturday 
[16 April] detained the former Socialist Party vice secretary, 
Giulio Di Donato, who thus became the first member of parliament 
of the former legislature facing corruption charges to be 
arrested after having lost his parliamentary immunity. 
  Di Donato is under investigation in several cases involving 
alleged corruption, violation of party financing laws and 
bribery. Last month he was indicted by a Naples court along with 
a former official of the telephone company, SIP [Italian 
State-Owned Telephone Company], on charges of attempted 
extortion. 
  According to the prosecution, executives of the IPM 
telephone 
company have testified they had been put under pressure to give 
jobs to people proposed by Di Donato or face cancellation of 
future sub-contracts with SIP. IPM managers were also asked for 
contributions to a magazine published by Socialist Party 
supporters of Di Donato, who also faces charges of abuse of 
office. 
  Public prosecutors in Naples on February 12 had issued a 
preventive detention warrant against Di Donato in connection 
with alleged kickbacks paid for the privatization of the city's 
garbage collection services. 
  Di Donato, who was not reelected in the March 27 elections 
and lost his parliamentary immunity when the new legislature was 
inaugurated earlier today, faces charges of abuse of office and 
corruption in connection with the affair. Magistrates have also 
issued a house arrest warrant for Di Donato in connection with 
the telephone company corruption case.

Anti-Mafia Operation"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Milan, April 18 -- More than 140 people were 
arrested in pre-dawn raids around the northern city of Milan and 
in several southern regions in a police operation code-named 
Scorched Earth, aimed against organized crime groups 
specializing in arms and drug trafficking, robbery and fencing 
stolen goods, police announced Monday [18 April]. 
  Police carried out more than 300 searches and confiscated an 
unspecified number of weapons, drugs and ammunition in the 
raids, which were a follow-up to Operation North-South which a 
few months ago struck at the drug and arms pipeline between 
south and north. 
  Most of the arrests, police said, were made in the northern 
region of Lombardy and in the poorer outskirts of Milan, where 
drug dealers are most active.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Advice to New Executive From Abete, </F>
Agnelli"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Verona, April 15 -- Luigi Abete, head of the 
private employers' association, Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry], and Gianni Agnelli, chairman 
of Italy's largest private company, Fiat, both gave some advice 
to the next government on the closing day of the Confindustria 
general conference here on Saturday [15 April]. 
  Abete, who leads the powerful industrial association which 
recently signed two ground-breaking labor accords with 
government and trade unions, said he had four simple 
suggestions, "four little measures" to be taken by a new 
government that will presumably be formed after parliament 
elects its speakers. 
  Confindustria, Abete said, would like reinvested company 
profits to be made tax deductible. He said he did not want this 
to be a "discount" but a "just differentiation between profit 
and revenues." 
  Second, Abete asked that company taxes be reviewed because 
of 
"the country's difficult moment," referring to recession. Abete 
then suggested that "something be done for the job market," 
adding: "We want more part-time and term contracts." Lastly, 
Abete asked the government to review laws on government 
contracts, which have been virtually frozen since corruption 
scandals erupted; "We want clear relations with politics," he 
said. 
  For his part, Agnelli said Italy's market and industry are 
evolving, becoming more efficient, "fair and just for 
consumers," but they are doing so very slowly. The new 
government, according to Agnelli, "has the chance to work well 
to lead and accelerate this change." 
  Before leaving for Rome, where the life senator is taking 
part in the election of the new Senate speaker, Agnelli, too, 
called for "greater mobility and flexibility" in the labor 
market and for a reduction in fiscal pressure, especially of 
direct taxes and of taxes that prevent small- and medium-sized 
companies from accumulating risk capital. 
  He also asked for legislation favoring investments for 
research, training and exports, and called for raising the 
mandatory school age limit from 14 to 16. 
  Agnelli also suggested creating tax incentives for 
industrial 
restructuring, speeding up privatizations, and warned that 
current debate on granting increased autonomy to regional 
authorities must proceed very carefully, "through calm and 
constructive discussions without controversial exasperations."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Short-Term Economic View Is Fair </F>
Says the National Institute for the Study of the Economic 
Situation"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 16 -- The barometer gauging the 
Italian economic trend is set on fair, said ISCO [National 
Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation], the 
institute for short-term economic trend studies, which cited a 
substantial pick-up in domestic demand, renewed confidence among 
consumers and businessmen, increased exports and inflation still 
well under control. 
  In a report issued today, ISCO said the only cloud on the 
horizon is that represented by industrial production suffering 
from "domestic demand which is still weak." The institute 
recalled that ISTAT, the National Statistics Institute, reported 
an industrial output increase of only 0.9 percent in January "as 
a result of differing trends in various sectors." 
  Uncertainties in industrial activities, moreover, still 
weigh 
on the labor market as seen by joblessness which grew from 9.4 
percent in January 1993 to 11.3 percent in January this year, 
said ISCO. 
  On domestic demand, the institute said already in November 
last year, ISTAT indicated that retail sales were growing at the 
annual rate of 6 percent, led by mass marketing outlets for 
which the increase was put at 6.9 percent, by hard goods, up by 
9.7 percent for home appliances and consumer electronics and by 
7.9 percent for photography equipment. Sales reported by big 
supermarkets rose by 13.7 percent annually, noted ISCO. 
  For inflation, ISCO said the increase for March was limited 
to 0.2 percent, as reported by ISTAT, and well below the figures 
for January and February, 0.6 and 0.4 percent, to leave the 
annual rate steady at 4.3 percent. 
  Growth on the export front has been further confirmed by the 
heightened competitive stance of national industry and 
accompanied by a lower profile on the side of domestic demand, 
said ISCO.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Federal Vote on 12 June: Swiss </F>
Blue Helmets Would Not Go to Former Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] Berne, 18 Apr (ATS) -- Switzerland does not have to 
belong to the United Nations to form a troop of blue helmets, 
nor does it have to give up its neutrality. Moreover, it would 
only send its men on peacekeeping missions, and not into 
conflicts such as that in the former Yugoslavia. This is how 
Swiss Federal Councillor Kaspar Villiger countered the arguments 
of opponents of the blue helmets. He was speaking in Bern on 
Monday [18 April] in a debate organized by the Swiss radical 
press association. 
  The head of the Federal Military Department (DMF) expressed 
his concern that attention had been focused on the three most 
spectacular operations involving UN blue helmets, namely, those 
being carried out in the background of the wars raging in the 
former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Rwanda. These cases are 
exceptions overshadowing the 14 other operations currently being 
implemented successfully, for example in Cyprus, the Golan 
Heights, and Cambodia. 
<H5>  No Swiss Sent to War </H5>
  Mr. Villiger stressed that Swiss blue helmets would not be 
sent to war and would only participate in operations where their 
independence was guaranteed. It would be wrong to claim that 
sending out a force of blue helmets is incompatible with Swiss 
neutrality. The blue helmets are precisely neutral 
intermediaries between opposing forces, there to "give peace a 
chance." Other neutral countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and 
Austria have had blue helmets for some time. 
  Switzerland benefits from external security, if only by 
avoiding being submerged by requests for asylum. The DMF head 
stressed that the issue of possible NATO membership, if it ever 
came up again, would have to be put to a vote of the people of 
the Swiss cantons. It is therefore wrong to claim that the 
creation of a troop of blue helmets would automatically lead to 
membership. 
<H5>  Bosnia Is a Bad Example </H5>
  Austria's Major General Guenter Greindl, who headed the UN 
forces for 13 years, also participated in the debate which was 
organized in the light of the upcoming vote of 12 June. He 
emphasized that Austria considers the blue helmets to be an 
important aspect of its active neutrality policy. In his 
opinion, the Bosnia example gave a deformed view of reality. 
The radical national councilor Oscar Fritschi (ZH) also 
condemned the "dangerous method" of showing just the negative 
aspects. It was even possible to speak of success in the former 
Yugoslavia, since blue helmets have saved hundreds of lives 
there. 
  Peter Vollmer, the Socialist national councilor from Bern, 
claimed that by participating in the UN peacekeeping missions, 
Switzerland would make a major but insufficient contribution. 
This was just a first step toward a more open and 
solidarity-minded policy. For Mr. Vollmer, it is time to 
redefine Swiss neutrality. 
<H5>  No "Lack of Solidarity" </H5>
  The only opponent invited to speak in the debate, National 
Councillor Walter Steinmann of the Automobile Drivers' Party, 
pointed to the distress of the blue helmets in the former 
Yugoslavia. He considered that Switzerland would not be able to 
pull its troops out of a war zone if the situation deteriorated 
rapidly. Switzerland does not have a "lack of solidarity" it 
has to make up. In addition to its financial support through 
humanitarian and development aid, the was already showing its 
solidarity through the Red Cross and the Swiss Disaster 
Assistance Corps.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "Power Plant on Kola Is Cause </F>
for Concern"] 
  [Text] Norwegian nuclear authorities are quite concerned 
about the safety of the power plant on the Kola peninsula and 
worry about a serious nuclear accident. 
  This last week Norwegian authorities have received two 
bulletins from the nuclear power plant Polyarnye Sori about 
small accidents. On 3 March the cooling system of one of the old 
pressurized water reactors sprung a leak. Fifty cubic meters of 
cooling water ran out. On an international accident scale of 
zero to seven, this accident rated a two. Last Sunday [6 March] 
another bulletin appeared: A steam leak and an increase in the 
level of radiation was measured at reactor number three that was 
then stopped. This accident rated only a zero on the accident 
scale. 
  "Neither of these accidents was particularly serious. 
Neither 
of them could develop into anything big. However, there is still 
cause for serious concern. They say something about the 
situation in general at the nuclear power plant," says Ole 
Harbitz, the director of the National Radiation Protection 
Service. 
<H5>  Dangerous Neighbor </H5>
  When questioned about whether the situation is critical, he 
answers: 
  "It is critical that Norway has a neighboring nuclear power 
plant that is in such a poor condition. An accident might just 
as easily happen tomorrow as in a week or in 10 years. I will 
not be surprised if there is a serious accident at the plant," 
Harbitz says. Two of the four reactors at the plant are of a 
type that Western experts think should be put out of commission 
as soon as possible. 
  He follows the situation with Argus-eyed vigilance. He is 
very worried as to safety. Employees have been paid only 
sporadically this winter. Often months have passed between each 
payday. Work morale at the plant is consequently poor. And money 
for even the simplest maintenance work has been lacking since as 
far back as September of last year. This latest accident is a 
typical wear-and-tear accident in which parts should have been 
replaced long ago. 
  "We are aware that there is a lack of money for wages and 
maintenance. This is cause for concern. Signals from Kola show 
that the risk of a serious accident has not decreased," Harbitz 
says. 
  When questioned as to how great this risk really is, he 
answers: "The risk is a product of probability and consequence. 
Even though the probability of a large accident might still be 
small, the consequences for Norway will be so significant that 
the risk still will have to be considered large," Harbitz thinks. 
  Norwegian nuclear authorities have not received any urgent 
appeals for technical help from the Kola power plant. "Moreover, 
we should stick to the strategy of helping with repairing only 
the most critical deficiencies, but not contributing to 
modernizing the plant so that it will continue to operate. Maybe 
we can hope that the present problems will lead to a more timely 
shutdown," Harbitz says.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "New Report From Bellona: </F>
Russian Plans for Nuclear Dumping"] 
  [Text] Russia is considering whether to dump old submarine 
reactors in the ocean in order to solve the waste crisis that 
the START II agreement will cause. 
  This sensational allegation appears in a new Bellona report 
published yesterday concerning the nuclear situation in 
northwest Russia. The environmental foundation has had access to 
hitherto unknown documents showing how and where Russia intends 
to dismantle 150 nuclear submarines. 
  The documents show that all future decommissioning of 
nuclear 
submarines, including vessels from the Pacific fleet, will take 
place in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea, 
southeast of the Kola peninsula. According to the START II 
agreement, Russia will decommission 150 nuclear submarines 
carrying 278 reactors in the next few years. 
  So far only two nuclear submarines, with four reactors, have 
been completely dismantled. The fuel rods have been removed from 
another 34 vessels, of which 16 come from the Northern fleet. 
According to the Bellona report, nuclear submarines with a total 
of 206 nuclear reactors and 45,000 used fuel rods will be 
dismantled at Severodvinsk. 
  In the Bellona report, which is the first comprehensive 
report concerning the nuclear situation in the region, a 
detailed overview will be published for the first time 
describing how the two enormous submarine yards in Severodvinsk 
will be upgraded in order to handle the huge dismantling job. 
The plan includes, among other things, the building of new dry 
docks, a new installation intended for the removal of fuel rods, 
improvements of the railroad from Severodvinsk to the nuclear 
city of Mayak in Siberia, and the construction of docking 
facilities for the storage of nuclear submarines. 
  "The upgrading of Severodvinsk was to have been carried out 
between 1993 and 1998 in order to receive the many submarines 
that will be decommissioned. However, several of the projects 
that should have been started last year are still in the 
planning stage. The uncertainty as to the responsibility and the 
financing might result in the postponement of the dismantling 
and destruction of the submarines. In the meantime the 
submarines are being stored in bays and fjords along the Kola 
peninsula, among other places," says the two authors of the 
report, Thomas Nilsen and Nils Bohmer. 
<H5>  Full Storage Facilities </H5>
  The definite plans for the improvement of the Severodvinsk 
docks that Bellona has had access to include only pure dock 
functions per se and a small increase in the capacity for the 
interim storage of nuclear waste. As all storage facilities for 
nuclear waste in the Kola region were filled to capacity a long 
time ago, new solutions must be found. The used fuel that is 
most radioactive will be carried to the nuclear city of Mayak 
according to the plan. But there is no place to send the 
reactors, the reactor sections and other solid radioactive waste. 
  "From the documentation we have received and from the talks 
we have had with different people, it has become clear that 
Russian authorities are considering two alternatives. One is to 
dump the waste in the Kara Sea as was done up through 1991. The 
other possibility is to build a new regional storage facility 
for solid waste," Nilsen and Bohmer say. 
  The two men express a great deal of worry over the nuclear 
situation up north: 
  "In addition to the 150 nuclear submarines that will be 
destroyed in accordance with the START II agreement, it is 
assumed that 80 Russian nuclear submarines will be taken out of 
operation because of their age over the next 30 to 40 years. As 
all storage facilities are full and there is no money to build 
an expensive new long-term storage facility, we fear that 
dumping will again become the only alternative. Maybe that is 
why Russia has refrained from signing the final London 
convention against such ocean dumping," Nilsen says. 
  It can be clearly seen from the Bellona report that the 
nuclear waste crisis in northwest Russia in no way has improved 
during the last year. 
  However, Bohmer and Nilsen say that what they fear most is 
the social [repercussions of the] nuclear crisis. 
  "Workers in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk, at the 
nuclear 
power plant, at Atomflot, and at the military Northern fleet are 
paid only rarely. It is not uncommon for them to go three to 
four months without being paid. The result is that they are 
careless with security. I fear that human error might lead to an 
accident long before the technical equipment actually fails," 
Bellona's nuclear physicist Bohmer says. Discarded nuclear 
submarines with intact reactors that are stored in the various 
fjords around the Kola peninsula need just as careful 
maintenance as nuclear submarines that are in operation. 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thanks Bellona </H5>
  "Bellona has access to channels of communication and 
information that we do not have. That is why they compliment our 
work," Thorbjorn Norendal, the assistant director of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, says. He is heading the 
preparation of a white paper on nuclear safety in northwest 
Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given financial 
support to Bellona's work in Russia. 
  "Bellona's new report is a factual and straightforward 
account of the problems," Norendal says. 
  He thinks that Russia probably will not resume ocean 
dumping. 
"However, the fact that this is under consideration shows how 
urgent the problem is. It is news to us that all dismantling of 
old nuclear submarines will take place in Severodvinsk. I fear 
that this will mean an accumulation of nuclear waste in the 
north. Unlike the United States, the Russians have made no plans 
for where to store all the old reactor sections. The thought 
that they will be floating in the water at the docks in the 
fjords around Kola is a frightening one," Norendal says. 
  He states that Norway's resources will not reach far in 
helping Russia. "However, we are prepared to participate in 
creating an international movement in order to help them with 
their disarmament, which will be just as expensive as the 
[original] armament was."

<F P=106> [Erich Hauser report: "Kinkel Sees Symbol in Gorazde's </F>
Fate"] 
  [Text] Luxembourg, 18 April -- The conference of the 
European Union [EU] foreign ministers on Monday [18 April] 
focused on the critical situation of the Bosnian Muslim enclave 
of Gorazde. However, in anticipation of further news from 
Gorazde, the beginning of the debate was postponed to the late 
afternoon. Results were not available until the copy deadline 
of this edition. 
  Before the beginning of the deliberations, in which EU 
mediator Lord Owen also participated, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel said that political and psychological pressure on the 
Serbs has to be increased. Gorazde has "become a symbol that 
must show whether they (the Serbs -- FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU 
editor's note) are really prepared to give in." Kinkel admitted 
that there are also voices in the EU circle that want to 
consider at least the withdrawal of the UN blue helmets from 
Bosnia, while others, like Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros 
Papoulias, recommend the lifting of the sanctions that were 
imposed against Serbia and Montenegro by the UN Security Council. 
  Kinkel had canceled on his own initiative the planned 
"presentation" of Hans Koschnick, EU administrator designate for 
the City of Mostar, in the EU Council of Ministers. Kinkel said 
that he had realized that no time would be left for Koschnick's 
presentation because of the topical problems. During their 
meeting in Ioannina, the 12 had already accepted the former 
mayor of Bremen for the later establishment of a Serbian-Bosnian 
administration in Mostar at the proposal of Germany. 
  Originally, the debate on the situation in Gorazde should 
have started during the ministers' lunch. However, instead, the 
situation in Algeria was discussed. Here possible effects of an 
increase in the Islamic fundamentalists' power on the 
neighboring countries had played a role, Kinkel said. EU 
Commission President Jacques Delors presented a report on 
possible steps for Algeria's economic support.

<F P=106> [Michel De Muelenaere report: "The Twelve Want To Believe </F>
in Diplomatic Action"] 
  [Text] "This is a diplomatic challenge, but at this point 
we have no other proposal." The European foreign ministers 
meeting in Luxembourg yesterday felt helpless. A meager 
consolation, however, is that all the parties involved in the 
Bosnian crisis without exception have been slapped in the face 
in Goradze. "Neither the UN nor the NATO actions have been able 
to help Goradze in a decisive way," German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel said. However, the Twelve have not resigned 
themselves to giving up nor agreed to put up with a further 
deterioration of the situation. "We do not accept fait 
accomplis," Alain Juppe said. 
  "The diplomatic initiative must resume." In line with the 
request put forward by Paris, the Twelve are urging the UN 
Security Council to adopt a resolution which includes the four 
proposals of Yasuhsi Akashi, UN special envoy to former 
Yugoslavia: immediate cease-fire in Goradze, withdrawal of 
Serbian troops to the positions they occupied before the 
attacks, guaranteed exclusion zone around the town, and 
deployment of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  No additional pressure will be exerted, however, including 
the threat of air strikes. But turning those elements into a 
Security Council resolution will give them additional force, 
according to the Twelve. "Goradze has become a symbol," 
according to Klaus Kinkel. "A withdrawal of the UN troops will 
not benefit anyone, not even to the Serbs themselves." 
  "They are acting out of despair because they feel isolated," 
Willy Claes believes. "But by attacking the blue helmets, they 
are playing with dynamite." 
  A lifting of the sanctions against Belgrade is out of the 
question. "We cannot accept this blackmail," a minister 
stressed. "First, the West must make clear demands and the Serbs 
must send a positive sign, then we will see...." As far as 
leaving former Yugoslavia is concerned, "no one envisages such 
an option," Mr. Claes added. 
  The real new element is the willingness of all sides to 
achieve better cooperation between the UN, European, Russian, 
and U.S. negotiators. "One day the Serbs talk to Churkin, the 
next day they see Redman, and then Akashi," Alain Juppe 
complained. "On the day they entered Goradze, the Serbs 
explained to Messrs. Akashi and Churkin that they were ready to 
negotiate." 
  To put an end to the game being played by the Serbs, the 
Europeans suggest that the four main powers should create a 
joint negotiating team that would make it possible to put 
pressure on the warring sides. "The three parties have agreed 
to return to the negotiating table," according to the French. 
"But it has not materialized because they have not found any 
unified front. Moreover, the Goradze case has been badly 
managed." According to the French, U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher "has not said `no.'" Russian negotiator Vitaly 
Churkin has supposedly approved the principle of a joint forum.

  [Text] Luxembourg, April 19 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] is hoping for a quick breakthrough in stalled negotiations 
for a partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, EU 
officials said here Tuesday [19 April]. 
  Speaking at a meeting of the EU's Ministerial Foreign 
Affairs 
Council, EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the two sides 
had narrowed their differences over trade in nuclear fuel, one 
of the issues holding up an accord. 
  Brittan also urged a rapid aid programme for Ukraine 
involving agricultural and energy support in order to brake an 
economic slide in the former Soviet republic. 
  And the EU foreign ministers formally acknowledged the 
receipt of applications from Hungary and Poland to join the 
union. The applications were given to the European Commission 
for evaluation. 
  An EU spokesman said: "We believe the time is ripe for a 
push 
to complete the negotiations with Russia." 
  The accord would support economic reform in Russia by giving 
it better access to European markets leading eventually to a 
free trade agreement. 
  It was supposed to be signed last June but has been held up 
mainly by disputes over sales of nuclear fuels such as plutonium 
and restrictions on the operations of foreign banks in Russia. 
  France in particular has been trying in the face of Russian 
opposition to have the trade in nuclear fuels excluded from the 
partnership agreement, so that curbs can more easily be applied 
on Russian exports. 
  The officials said France, the principal producer in Europe, 
was worried that export surges of Russian nuclear fuels could 
lead to a price collapse damaging to its own nuclear fuel 
producers. 
  But German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ursula 
Seiler-Albring said Russia had promised to restrain its sales of 
nuclear fuels if the trade could be included in the agreement. 
  The officials said no progress had been made in another 
dispute involving restrictions on foreign banks operating in 
Russia, which bar them from accepting Russian deposits. 
  Russian envoy Alexandr Shotkin is expected in Brussels later 
this month to continue negotiations. 
  The European Commission also presented the outlines of an 
aid 
programme for Ukraine to be presented to the ministers for 
approval next month. 
  Brittan said it involved sending seed and fertiliser to help 
support the country's crumbling agricultural system, plus aid to 
finance the purchase of EU agricultural produce. 
  The European Commission is also proposing aid to help 
Ukraine 
build new nuclear power stations, on condition that Kiev closes 
down dangerously outdated plants such as the Chernobyl station 
which was damaged in a 1986 accident.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Nordic Countries To Coordinate </F>
Their UN Operations"] 
  [Text] The Nordic countries intend to reinforce the Nordic 
UN presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will be achieved 
through Sweden and Norway gradually decreasing their UN forces 
in Macedonia. To compensate Finland is prepared to contribute 
more personnel to Macedonia. Denmark is represented in Bosnia 
relatively "heavily" with the majority of its UN force in the 
Tuzla region and is not likely to redeploy its men to any great 
extent. 
  This in broad outline was the outcome of the Nordic defense 
ministers' coordination meeting in Oslo on Sunday [17 April]. 
  "We are agreed that it is important that we are flexible in 
the way in which we make UN forces available. The most 
effective help is achieved when we can deploy forces where they 
are most needed," Norwegian Defense Minister Jorgen Kosmo said 
after the meeting. 
  Finland is prepared to take the Nordic responsibility for UN 
personnel in Macedonia, Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn 
confirmed. 
  "But the Finnish Government has not as yet discussed the 
size 
of the force with which we will increased our UN personnel in 
Macedonia," Rehn said. 
  The Americans have said that they are willing to increase 
their presence in Macedonia as the Nordic UN force's operations 
are shifted more and more to Bosnia. 
  Finland has a force of 230 men in Macedonia. It also has a 
force of observers in Bosnia and a unit in Croatia. 
  The Norwegian Government intends to propose to the Storting 
that the country should put a new 370-man force at the UN's 
disposal in Bosnia, Defense Minister Kosmo said. If the 
Storting approves the proposal, the new force will be ready to 
leave for Bosnia in about three months' time. Once Norway has 
reduced its operations in Macedonia the Norwegians will have a 
UN force of around 850 men in the former Yugoslavia, a little 
more than today. 
  Both Denmark and Sweden each have around 1,300 men in the 
former Yugoslavia. The Danes are heavily represented in Bosnia 
with almost 1,000 men. 
  Neither Denmark nor Sweden has plans to increase its efforts 
in the former Yugoslavia. Swedish Defense Minister Anders 
Bjorck said that his country currently has 140 UN soldiers in 
Macedonia. A little over 100 of them have said that they are 
willing to move to Bosnia. They will travel home to Sweden next 
week for training. Thereafter it is planned that they will be on 
the ground in Tuzla in mid-May. 
  The Nordic defense ministers also took the opportunity to 
discuss the general situation in Bosnia after the events of 
recent days.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with FYROM President Kiro Gligorov by </F>
Othon Zimmerman in Skopje; date not given: "Gligorov Says Greeks 
Must Calm Down"] 
  [Text] Skopje -- Actually he is Bulgarian, say the Greeks, 
referring to FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] 
President Kiro Gligorov. Moreover, they add, he is also a 
former communist. 
  However, in FYROM everyone agrees about one thing: Gligorov 
is the president that the country needs. The 76-year-old 
politician is a kind of father of the fatherland, the link 
cementing together a small Balkan republic, which is arduously 
progressing toward democracy and stability. He is a man who has 
a soft spot for the Netherlands: "Your country has really helped 
us tremendously," he said. 
  The FYROM flag -- a red background bearing the disputed 
golden star of Vergina -- flies proudly in the grand 
presidential office. 
  The use of the star is one of the reasons why, on 16 
February, Greece announced a boycott against FYROM -- or Skopje, 
as the Greeks call it. Other points of conflict include the 
name of the country, the "Republic of Macedonia," and a passage 
of the Constitution in which FYROM says that it intends to stand 
up for FYROM nationals living outside the country's national 
borders. Athens regards this as tantamount to laying a claim on 
the Greek province of Macedonia, and speaks of pilfering Greek 
history. Attempts at mediation by the United Nations and 
European Union have proven fruitless. 
  [Zimmerman] Can the conflict with Greece still be resolved? 
  [Gligorov] If we deal with the matter reasonably, then a 
solution is possible. We must carry on as neighbors. I must 
say categorically that there are no real conflicts. We merely 
have common interests. Emotions in Greece have to calm down. 
The mass demonstrations must come to an end. When life gets 
back to normal we will manage to sort things out. At this 
moment in time, the Greek politicians, who are themselves 
responsible for the demonstrations, are incapable of rational 
thought. They are prisoners of the emotions which they 
themselves have stirred up. 
  [Zimmerman] Is there a possibility of compromises on the 
moot 
points: the name, the flag, and the constitution? 
  [Gligorov] We have already made concessions to Greece. We 
joined the United Nations under the name FYROM, the English 
abbreviation for Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a name 
that is utterly inappropriate and not in accordance with our 
Constitution. We have adapted the Constitution and made it 
clear that we do not wish to become involved in the internal 
affairs of our neighbors. We have proposed the conclusion of an 
agreement with Greece -- under the supervision of the United 
Nations or the European Union -- guaranteeing the inviolability 
of our respective borders. We did so again today. That should 
be enough to wipe away any fears regarding territorial claims. 
  However, nothing is good enough for Greece. Instead of 
opting for a dialogue, the government in Athens opted for an 
embargo that is causing us great damage. The Greeks are even 
making any resumption of talks subject to certain conditions. 
And if we give in to the Greek demands, what else will remain 
to be negotiated? We understand that compromises will have to 
be made by both parties, and we are prepared to accept that. 
But not under pressure of an embargo. 
  Why should we not call ourselves Macedonia, as this country 
has been known for the last 50 years? Who has the right to 
demand that people and states should change their name? And 
regarding Article 49 of our Constitution: The Greek Constitution 
contains an article containing virtually identical wording, the 
difference being that Greece believes that it can stand up for 
the interests of Greeks living abroad, while denying us the 
right to do the same. 
  [Zimmerman] Can the article be falsely interpreted? 
  [Gligorov] Look, the problem is quite simply that Greece 
denies the existence of national minorities. It believes that 
everyone in Greece is simply Greek, whereas there are also 
Turks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Vlachs, and Albanians living 
there. 
  [Zimmerman] Do the Greek demands conceal any territorial 
ambitions? 
  [Gligorov] I do not believe that Athens has any territorial 
ambitions toward the FYROM, but I am not convinced that the same 
applies to Greece's remaining neighbors. Think of the issue of 
northern Epirus (a region of Albania containing a Greek 
minority). There are also problems with Turkey. 
  [Zimmermann] The star of Vergina on the national flag could 
also have been a Macedonian lion. Vergina is in Greece, and the 
sarcophagus of Philip II, which bears the star, is in the 
archaeological museum in Thessaloniki. 
  [Gligorov] The Balkan cultures, like the people in the area, 
are mixed. You can also see this star in our churches. We have 
no intentions of stealing any of their national heritage or 
history. If everyone claims exclusive rights, then what should 
be done with the town of Ochrid, for example? That is where you 
can gain a picture of the history of the Balkans. Go and dig 
there: First you will come up against the Slavic culture, then 
the Byzantine, then the Roman, and Ancient Greek, and so on. 
The dispute is a good reflection of the atmosphere in the 
Balkans, which is one characterized by nationalism and emotions. 
  [Zimmermann] Can the embargo, with all the negative 
consequences it has for the people, lead to an upsurge of 
nationalism in your country? 
  [Gligorov] The danger is there. However, we are endeavoring 
to keep the passions under control. As was the case at the time 
of the first Greek embargo, imposed last year, we have not taken 
any countermeasures. Nor have there been any nationalist 
demonstrations here. Anything like that would merely lead to a 
running feud with the Greeks, which would only make the 
resolution of the problems more complex still. Consequently, I 
believe it is of the utmost importance that the demonstrations 
in Greece should stop, that the sentiments of the people there 
should no longer be manipulated. We all know where 
demonstrations of that kind led to in Yugoslavia: to war. 
  [Zimmermann] Is there a danger that the war in the former 
Yugoslavia will spill over into the FYROM? 
  [Gligorov] Of course. That is why we were so glad to have UN 
peacekeeping troops, including 600 Americans, in our country 
before a violent conflict broke out. The presence of the U.S. 
troops is politically and psychologically of great importance, 
and definitely gives us a sense of security. It is clear to 
everyone that the Americans are not here by chance. The U.S. 
superpower understands that there is a chance of the conflict 
spreading, and that Kosovo or the FYROM could become involved. 
If that were the case, then the situation would escalate into a 
Balkan war, involving involve two NATO countries, Greece and 
Turkey.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Kani Yilmaz, "spokesman of the </F>
political wing of the Kurdish Workers Party," by Klaus Tehar in 
Vienna; date not given --recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Tehar] The war between the Turkish Government 
and the marxist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] has acquired a 
European angle through the banning of Kurdish New Year's 
celebrations and German arms supplies to Turkey. At the moment, 
the Turkish Army is carrying out a military operation, in the 
course of which it has penetrated far into Iraqi territory. 
Kani Yilmaz, political representative of the PKK in Europe, 
said the following on this issue: 
  [Yilmaz] We do not only want the cease-fire, but we appeal 
to the Turkish Government to enter into a dialogue with us. Let 
us stop the war. The bloodshed must end. The Turkish and the 
Kurdish people should be able to coexist on an equal footing. 
This problem has to be solved. Prime Minister Ciller has 
unfortunately said that she would settle the affair through the 
use of force. She wanted to annihilate us even before the 
summer, but now it is spring, and we have, for the first time, 
30,000 people under arms and we can count on the support of 
millions of Kurds. So we are not negotiating from a position of 
weakness. If Turkey says no, things will even deteriorate. 
  [Tehar] After the banning of the PKK in Germany and the 
violent riots in connection with the Kurdish Newruz 
celebrations, Kurdish relations with Germany are tense. Kani 
Yilmaz attacks the German Government sharply. 
  [Yilmaz] Everywhere in Europe our emigres celebrated 
peacefully. Clashes occurred only in Germany. The German 
Government acted like Turkey does. Our evening rallies were 
banned, our flags and posters confiscated. The Germans must not 
forget one thing: It is with their weapons that our children 
are massacred. Nevertheless, we do not want to take the war to 
Germany. Let us talk with one another again. But, please, stop 
supplying arms to Turkey. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Wolfgang Purtscheller and Thomas Vasek: </F>
"Desperately Seeking Dr. Vanda"] 
  [Excerpts] At the end of March the usually very restrained 
director general of public security talked with surprising 
frankness about a specific lead. He hopes that the German 
authorities will soon find the suspected perpetrator of the 
letter-bomb attacks before Christmas, Michael Sika told DIE 
PRESSE. 
  The name that Sika mentioned in this connection was one that 
has been known for a long time in Austria: Ekkehard Weil, who 
was sentenced to six years in prison in 1981 after a series of 
bomb attacks on nine Jewish institutions and personalities. 
According to Sika, there has been no trace of Weil since 6 
December 1993, that is, since the beginning of the series of 
bombs. 
  This is purposeful disinformation. Because the "German 
lead," of which the Interior Ministry has been talking for quite 
some time, has never led to Ekkehard Weil. He was just 
considered as a witness, who it was hoped would provide the 
investigators of the Letter Bombs Special Commission with more 
detailed information about the German connection of Peter Binder 
and his comrades. 
  As if to prove that the lead to Weil cannot be so hot, the 
neo-Nazi appeared in public last week. He had to answer to the 
Eighth Criminal Division of the Bochum Land Court for 
"instigating people, fanning racial hatred, and insulting and 
slandering the memory of the deceased." On Monday and 
Wednesday, at 0900 in the morning each day, Ekkehard Wiel 
appeared in court room 147. 
  Months ago the right-wing extremist had found refuge in the 
Ruhr area under the cover name Karl Schubert. Most recently he 
found refuge with a Mrs. M. at Castropper Hellweg in Bochum. 
  So far, the trace leading to the Berlin Nazi rocker and 
Weil's friend Arnulf Priem has also proved to be unsuccessful; 
at the beginning of the bomb series Priem had been seen by three 
different witnesses on Vienna's subway. However, Priem brought 
regulars from his favorite restaurants to the Berlin police to 
back up his alibi. 
  The traces to Priem and Weil led to the surroundings of the 
infamous "occupied house" in Weitlingstrasse 122, where the two 
had free access for years. In Berlin's brown [fascist] scene 
the mystery of the "German trace" has become a bit clearer. The 
FRG authorities and the EBT (Antiterrorism Task Force) of the 
Austrian Interior Ministry have not been pursuing Weil since 
December but another one of the people living at 
Weitlingstrasse: Bendix Wendt, age 27, neo-Nazi and weapons 
fanatic with experience in using explosives. This man, who has 
been in prison several times and who has been a close friend of 
Priem's for some years, who has the say in the Berlin scene, was 
responsible for, among other things, the acquisition of military 
equipment from old GDR stocks. 
  Not quite two days after the arrest of suspected letter-bomb 
attacker Peter Binder, a certain Dr. Vanda from Berlin called 
the arrested man's wife. Why has Peter not yet arrived, the 
caller asks with an agitated voice. Binder's wife tells him 
what has happened: Her husband had just been caught at the 
Czech border. Vanda gets nervous, he must now disappear, he 
says, and puts down the receiver. The telephone had been bugged 
by the State Police. 
  Years ago, in a written statement to the police, Berlin 
ex-Nazi Ingo Hasselbach revealed the various cover names of his 
former comrades: Dr. Vanda, derived from Priem's troop The 
Vandals, is the pseudonym used by Bendix Wendt. 
  Under his correct name Wendt had talked to Binder's wife 
even 
before Binder was arrested, to tell her that his apartment had 
been searched and that he has to flee. "Why the search?" 
Brigitte Binder asks. Wendt: "Why do you think?" Cryptically, 
although the meaning is quite obvious, the two continue their 
dialogue. Everything indicates that subsequently Wendt became 
more cautious because of potential telephone bugging and, 
therefore, used his cover name for his next call. 
  Binder claimed he was on his way to Berlin when he was 
caught. He had met Bendix Wendt there during one of his 
previous trips. 
  The role of Dr. Vanda in the attacks in Austria is one of 
the 
last missing pieces in the letter-bomb puzzle, which the state 
has been trying to piece together for some months. The 
investigations of the EBT have now been concluded: Probably 
this week the so-called full complaint against three Austrian 
right-wing extremists, who are suspects in connection with the 
letter bombs, will be passed on to public prosecutor Sepp-Dieter 
Fasching: Peter Binder, 26 is suspected of having been 
essentially involved in the letter-bomb attacks and of having 
violated the Weapons Law and the law banning neo-Nazi activities 
(about 40 evidential facts). The case against Franz Radl 
junior, 26, is based on his being an accomplice to the deed and 
violating the law banning neo-Nazi activities (about 20 
evidential facts). The suspicion against Gerhard Endres, 32, 
refers to engaging in neo-Nazi activities and accumulating means 
of combat. [passage omitted] 
  Radl also had very close contacts with a Carinthian neo-Nazi 
group, which publishes the illegal Nazi pamphlet KAERNTNER 
BEOBACHTER [CARINTHIAN OBSERVER]. Two of Radl's closest fellow 
fighters, Andreas T. and Helmut Adolf S., turned up last year at 
the traditional Ulrichsberg meeting of the right-wing extremist 
scene in the company of a German Nazi terrorist and explosives 
expert: chemist Peter N., age 41. 
  Now, in addition to Dr. Vanda, this man is becoming the 
focus 
of interest for German and Austrian investigators. He is 
thought to have the expert knowledge in chemistry that the 
Austrians probably lacked. According to German sources, Wendt 
and N. were in contact with each other -- and with the Austrian 
comrades via Binder and the Carinthian Radl group. 
  "Given the fact that he started out at zero, the result is 
remarkable," a top state official concluded before these results 
of the investigations are passed on the public prosecutor. As a 
result, the Austrian State Police is closing the file on the 
letter bombs for the time being. Now it is Interpol's task to 
complete the increasingly complete letter-bomb puzzle: Because 
the Austrians are convinced that German neo-Nazis were involved. 
The search for Bendix Wendt a.k.a. Dr.Vanda is in full swing.

<F P=106> [Article by Wilhelm Teuretsbacher: "A Right-wing Extremist </F>
Division of Cells"] 
  [Text] Right-wing extremists are increasingly organizing 
themselves into so-called small cells. It is becoming 
increasingly international and brutal. The current annual report 
by the Interior Ministry, which has become exclusively available 
to KURIER, leaves no doubt that the fight against right-wing 
extremism will become tougher. 
  Statistically, the number of right-wing extremist offenses 
hardly changed in 1993 as compared with 1992. A total of 525 
reports were made, 113 house searches were carried out, and 20 
people were arrested. The police activities in connection with 
the letter-bomb attacks are not included in these statistics. 
The brutalization of the scene shows a shift in the offenses: 
There were fewer violations of the laws banning neo-Nazi 
activities and the wearing of Nazi insignia, but more offenses 
under the Penal Code. 
  A succession of generations is taking place. "In the 
executive committees of associations that cultivate the 
traditions and in moderately large organizations, revisionists 
and right-wing extremists are increasingly replacing the war 
generation," the report stresses. Of the 425 political parties 
that are registered with the Interior Ministry, 77 have been 
classified as leaning toward the right; nine have been banned. 
Several associations are being examined, including the Action 
Committee for Politics (AFP), which allegedly maintains close 
relations with the Military Sports Group Trenck. 
  Since the establishment of a separate group at the Vienna 
police headquarters for the fight against youth gangs, this 
problem is under control. Vorarlberg is an exception, where 
more right-wing extremist youth groups exist than in the rest of 
the country. One reason is reportedly the large number of 
foreigners in the province. 
  Right-wing extremist agitation at the political level 
declined in 1993. However, underground activities have 
increased -- above all in the provinces of Carinthia, Upper 
Austria, and Styria. So-called purposeful cell activities are 
involved there. Efforts to form a collective movement, as 
embodied by Gottfried Kuessel, for example, no longer exist. 
Joint action is being avoided. The activities by subgroups and 
small groups that have now developed are difficult to control by 
the police. The terrorists responsible for the letter-bomb 
attacks are also believed to belong to such cells. 
  The Congress of Revisionists has been described as the 
international platform. Such congresses took place in 1991 
(Munich) and 1992 (Stockholm). It has been proved that links 
exist with Germany, the United States, Hungary, Great Britain, 
Italy, Norway, Sweden, and France. German skinheads are mainly 
active in Vorarlberg, Salzburg, Upper Austria, and Vienna. In 
Carinthia, extremists from Spain and Switzerland have been seen. 
  There is a lively exchange of propaganda material. A 
Canadian revisionist disseminates his falsification of history 
through radio programs on short wave. In addition, a trade in 
computer diskettes that are also mailed to spokesmen at 
secondary and high schools is taking place. A modern mailbox 
system has also been developed. On one level, the Thule Network, 
installed in Germany, disseminates propaganda. On another, it 
is being used for communications. Austrian extremists are 
considered regular customers. 
  The executive bodies are also reacting with globalization. 
The Bern Club, to which the security services of the European 
Union and Austria belong, actions against right-wing extremism 
are being coordinated. Other security agreements have also been 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Report signed "fl": "Austria's Economy Is Recovering"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- Austria's economy is recovering again. 
The international upswing is also affecting the domestic 
economy. The Economic Research Institute (Wifo) predicts an 
increase in the GNP by 2 percent in real terms, while the 
Institute for Higher Studies (IHS) is more cautious and 
forecasts a 1.6-percent increase. 
  "We were in a position to clearly revise our predictions 
upward," Wifo head Helmut Kramer stated. "The upswing has 
become stronger and should continue in 1995." Wifo expects an 
increase of 3 percent and the IHS a growth of 2.4 percent for 
1995. 
  Private consumption, exports, and investments support the 
upswing. The German economy, which is lagging slightly behind, 
is a factor of insecurity, which might have an impact on 
Austria's tourism. "The weak economic situation and declining 
air fares might make other destinations more attractive," IHS 
head Bernhard Felderer pointed out. 
  Both institutes based their predictions on Austria's 
membership in the European Union [EU]. According to Kramer, no 
calculations were made for a different scenario but "it would 
certainly have a negative impact on the investment climate." 
Yet one should not expect too much from the "integration 
effect" because Austria has already been integrated to a large 
extent. A disintegration effect, however, would have a much 
stronger impact. 
  The opportunities for Austria are good: At a rising 
utilization of the capacities, prices will decline. 
  According to Wifo, the economic growth should be sufficient 
to stabilize the situation in the labor market. Yet the 
reduction of jobs in the industry will continue. Approximately 
10,000 industrial workers might lose their jobs this year and 
another 4,000 next year. The unemployment rate is expected to 
remain largely unchanged because more employment and jobs will 
be available. 
  A decline of prices resulting from membership in the EU 
might 
cause the increase in the consumer price index to drop to below 
3 percent. "A 2.8-percent increase is quite possible," Kramer 
believes and foresees another decline to 2.2 percent for 1995. 
The IHS predicts an increase of consumer price index by 3.1 
percent for 1994 and a 2.8-percent rise for 1995.

<F P=106> [Report by Christine Domforth: "Key Rates Decrease, But Not </F>
Lending Interest Rates"] 
  [Excerpts] Vienna -- The Austrian National Bank (OeNB) cut 
the key rates yesterday. The discount rate was decreased from 5 
to 4.75 percent and the Lombard rate from 6 to 5.75 percent. 
The Gomex rate, which is important for the money-procurement 
costs of the banks, was decreased from 5.5 to 5.4 percent. The 
new rates are valid as of today, Friday. The first round of 
interest cuts in 1994 was implemented in mid-February. [passage 
omitted] 
  In an interview with DIE PRESSE, OeNB President Maria 
Schaumayer justified the move using the "harmonization of the 
European interest rate structure" argument. It was also taken 
in anticipation of a decreasing inflation tendency. Austria's 
key rates continue to be lower than the German rates, which, 
according to Schaumayer, is a "sign of strength" and a 
confirmation of Austria's line. She hopes that, as a result of 
the decreased rate of price increases in Germany, Austria will 
again import stability from there in the near future. [passage

<F P=106> [Report signed "kmm": "Temelin-Type Nuclear Power Plant </F>
Instead of Chernobyl"] 
  [Text] The Chernobyl conference convened at short notice 
in Vienna will discuss until Friday [22 April] specific 
possibilities concerning a shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant. As reported, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] had identified factors that seriously affect the safety 
of the two rector blocks that are currently operating as well as 
a deterioration of the shelter enclosing the reactor destroyed 
in 1986. 
  "If Chernobyl is shut down, there are two alternatives to 
ensure Ukraine's energy supply," IAEA Deputy Director Forrest 
Remick, who is participating in the meeting, told KURIER. 
"First, a more efficient use of energy, and second, the startup 
of other power plants." 
  An agreement on the second alternative is possible. A total 
of six nuclear power plants are under construction in Ukraine, 
three of which might be completed within six months with 
international help involving the equivalent of 2.4 billion 
schillings, Remick pointed out. Important people are 
participating in the Vienna conference, including the Ukrainian 
deputy prime minister and representatives of the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development. 
  The three reactors that are to be installed in Chernobyl are 
WWER-1000 [water-cooled water-moderated] type. Reactors of this 
kind have been used in the Temelin nuclear power plant in the 
Czech Republic, which is to be completed with U.S. aid. This 
issue is also being discussed by Chancellor Vranitzky during his 
visit to the United States. On Tuesday [19 April] Prague's 
Environment Minister did not rule out that an environmental 
inspection might be carried out at Temelin.

<F P=106> ["ban." report: "Bundeswehr Not in the Balkans"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 18 Apr -- On Monday [18 April], Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Scharping basically 
rejected the employment of Bundeswehr soldiers in the former 
Yugoslavia. With a view to the past and the actions of German 
troops in the Balkans, Scharping said that, in whatever role, 
German soldiers might become targets there. Thus, he also 
rejected the participation of German troops in blue helmet 
missions in the successor states of Yugoslavia. Scharping 
called on Chancellor Kohl to make the attitude of the Federal 
Government clear. While, in former times, Kohl had clearly 
rejected the employment of German soldiers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the chancellor recently made "soft" 
comments. On the other hand, Schaeuble, chairman of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Bundestag Group, is advancing considerations that Germany should 
actively commit itself in the military sphere in the Balkans. 
Scharping called this irresponsible. 
  The SPD chairman concentrated his criticism on Schaeuble. 
Referring to Franco's dictatorship in Spain, he said that his 
considerations to also employ the Bundeswehr for internal 
security is a "game with Francist ideas." In this way, 
Schaeuble is showing that he only takes the Basic Law seriously 
if he thinks that this is tactically required. However, with 
his considerations, Schaeuble gives the following signal to 
foreign countries: "We are an unstable country." He also 
expects Kohl to "clarify" this "completely." Scharping accused 
Schaeuble of having propagated the impression in Washington, 
during his trip to the United States at the end of March, that a 
SPD victory in the Bundestag elections will harm German-U.S. 
relations. 
  Scharping said that his visit to Washington and New York 
confirmed to him that the "basic orientation" of German foreign 
politics should also be maintained in the event of his victory 
in the election. Scharping mentioned European integration, the 
friendship with France and the United States, integration within 
the NATO alliance, a reliable relationship with the East 
European states, and cooperation with the developing countries 
as elements of foreign policy agreement with the FRG Government. 
In detail, there are differences with regard to government 
policy. The prospect of entry into the European Union has to be 
made clearer to Germany's neighboring states in the East. 
Improvements are possible in German-U.S. relations, he said. 
  With a view to the Federal Constitutional Court proceedings 
on the Bundeswehr's participation in missions outside the NATO 
mandate, which will start in Karlsruhe this Tuesday, Scharping 
said he expects that the complaint of the SPD and the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] will be successful, so that 
the Bundestag will have to be involved in relevant decisions in 
the future. As soon as the questions of constitutional policy 
are clarified, the political questions will again be in the 
foreground. The SPD attitude that it will not even participate 
in "warlike" UN measures will be maintained. However, in the 
SPD's opinion, Germany can participate in such UN missions as 
have been the practice in the past. UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's wish that a UN blue helmet troop be established 
with German participation can be reconciled with the resolutions 
of the SPD Congress.

  [Text] [Announcer] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
appeared before the judges in Karlsruhe today, and now he is in 
front of our cameras. Welcome to the Mittagsmagazin, Herr 
Kinkel. Are lawyers getting involved in politics again? Or, to 
rephrase that question, does the Bundestag need such a supreme 
lawgiver? 
  [Kinkel] We would have preferred it if the Bundestag had 
made 
the necessary decision, and I have pressed the Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] on this again and again. Unfortunately, the SPD 
blocked the decision. We need it; the coalition proposed a 
draft amendment to the Basic Law, but we need a two-thirds 
majority and we did not get it. That is why we had to come here. 
  [Announcer] What argument did you make to the judges? You 
are caught in the middle, so to speak: the government you belong 
to on the one hand, and the Free Democratic Party [FDP], which 
wants something slightly different, on the other. 
  [Kinkel] I am not caught in the middle at all, because 
politically it was clear between all of us that we want these 
three missions to go ahead. It was only with the AWACS mission 
[German personnel would crew AWACS reconnaissance aircraft over 
Bosnia] that the FDP parliamentary group had some doubts about 
whether Article 87A (2) or Article 24 of the Basic Law is the 
legal basis for this. That is the subject of the dispute here, 
and with such a difficult legal position it will be necessary, 
appropriate, and also possible to turn to the Constitutional 
Court. After all, that is what it is there for. 
  But this morning I argued that we urgently need this 
amendment to the Basic Law, a ruling by the Constitutional 
Court, now -- because we could not reach such a ruling in the 
Bundestag -- so that we can become capable of action in foreign 
policy. The chancellor and I are the ones who suffer almost 
daily from this situation because our friends and partners do 
not understand why, after unification, we are still to a certain 
extent in the spectators' gallery and to an extent incapable of 
action. We must come on down, we must be able to help remove 
violations of human rights and alleviate the direst need in this 
world. It was not for nothing this morning that I pointed out 
that 80,000 UN soldiers from 68 countries are carrying out 16 
missions all over the world. Germany cannot go its own way. It 
must get involved. 
  [Announcer] Herr Kinkel, you also want the Bundestag to make 
majority decisions. Do you believe agreements would be reached 
then, for the discussion of this topic has been going on for a 
very long time? 
  [Kinkel] We put forward a coalition draft proposal, which 
states that the German lower house should decide on any future 
mission. I am convinced that this would be the right thing. As 
regards the issue of majority decisions, this proposal says 
there should be a simple majority on peacemaking and 
peacekeeping measures. We hope we will soon hear what the 
Federal Constitutional Court has to say on this. 
  [Announcer] What should the Bundeswehr be allowed to do 
then, 
quite specifically, without drawing down the anger of the 
world--not too much and not too little? 
  [Kinkel] For the time being, the Bundeswehr's prime task 
will 
be defense. But the world has changed. We need peacekeeping 
and peacemaking measures--blue helmet missions. In isolated, 
exceptional cases we will also need to be involved in 
peacemaking measures because there are situations--and that is 
the way things are--which unfortunately require the use of force 
as the ultimate resort to end them. The Bundeswehr should be 
able to get involved in the future just as other armies in the 
world do. Remember what happened in Rwanda last week. It was 
strange that we had to give so much thought to whether we could 
possibly bring out our own people, the 11 personnel of Deutsche 
Welle who were trapped there. That is absurd. It cannot stay 
that way; we must become capable of action. 
  [Announcer] Herr Kohl has said German soldiers should never 
go where German troops have been in the past. Defense Minister 
Ruehe does not take quite such a narrow view. What is your 
position? With whom would you tend to agree? 
  [Kinkel] The chancellor is not talking in general terms, but 
specifically about Yugoslavia. I agree with him completely that, 
because of the historical situation, we would not achieve a 
Bundestag majority for the deployment of German troops there, 
even if we were constitutionally able to do so. This is an 
opinion I share. 
  [Announcer] You are saying there should be no combat 
deployments. But should it not be possible to sanction legally 
what is already being done in practice? The Americans, who shot 
down four military jets over Bosnia, were directed toward their 
target by German servicemen. Wasn't that a combat mission? 
  [Kinkel] That is the legal question I mentioned earlier, the 
matter of AWACS missions. It is true that a German was involved 
in operating the AWACS aircraft's flight guidance system. But 
the Constitutional Court permitted this, so to speak, through a 
temporary order, and this is what we want to see examined here. 
As regards AWACS deployment, the FDP's legal position differs 
from that of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social 
Union. This is why we need clarification. 
  [Announcer] We should also discuss the current situation in 
Bosnia, Herr Kinkel. Bill Clinton is conducting defense policy 
discussions as we speak. He has said that he might alter his 
policy on Bosnia slightly, and he said this morning that he is 
looking for recommendations. What would you recommend or advise 
him to do? 
  [Kinkel] As I repeated yesterday in Luxembourg, and I shall 
say it in Luxembourg again this evening, and yet again when I go 
to the United States the day after tomorrow, we are not the ones 
to be giving advice because our constitutional situation means 
we cannot become involved. You see, the main problem is simply 
that the situation could be resolved only by means of combat 
troops being deployed on the ground. None of the countries who 
are legally and actually capable of this are willing to do so, 
and I appreciate their reservations. 
  Whenever someone here in Germany says something has to be 
done and we have to get involved militarily, I ask whether the 
Germans are willing to send their sons there. Until now, if I 
have gauged the public mood accurately, people are not greatly 
in favor of this, even if our constitution permitted it. This 
is why we are not the ones to be giving advice. 
  By the way, just imagine, the French have 6,000 men on the 
ground, the British over 2,000; the Danish, the Belgians, the 
Dutch--all of them have troops there. And of course they want 
to ensure that these troops are not endangered by bombing 
missions. Gorazde has a specific situation: We have 60,000 
encircled Muslims as well as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
people who are still there. You can imagine that air strikes 
would be extremely dangerous. The Americans have started 
looking at new options with the United Nations and NATO. Let's 
wait and see what happens. 
  [Announcer] I think there is still plenty more talking to be 
done. Many thanks, Herr Kinkel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Werner </F>
Mueck in Karlsruhe on 19 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mueck] Judges now have to decide whether recent 
German Bundeswehr operations within the UN and NATO framework 
were okay. Does this not also mean that they decide on the role 
Germany will play in the future in the family of peoples, in the 
United Nations, in NATO? 
  [Kinkel] Of course, they decide on that. Since we failed to 
reach a political agreement in the Bundestag on amending the 
Basic Law, now, unfortunately, the Federal Constitutional Court 
has to decide. At the end of the day, I am glad about it, 
because we will finally get a decision. 
  [Mueck] If the Court comes up with a narrow interpretation, 
Germany's desire to get a seat on the UN Security Council would 
then be impossible to fulfill. 
  [Kinkel] Well, I assume and hope that the decision will be 
positive, and that it will be a decision that will serve our 
foreign and security policy. As far as the Security Council 
seat is concerned, I believe that we could only get the seat 
after we had become fully capable of taking action, that is to 
say after we become able to participate in out-of-area missions. 
  [Mueck] One will then hardly be able to decide on actions in 
which one is unable to participate oneself. 
  [Kinkel] That is right, that is what I meant before. 
  [Mueck] You have said that you hope that the judges will not 
produce an interpretation that is too narrow. Yet, would it not 
be better if they did, because then the pressure might be 
greater to amend the Basic Law? 
  [Kinkel] We cannot have a Basic Law amendment at the moment, 
because the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will not 
support it, but is obstructing the process. We need a 
two-thirds majority, which is why I do not see any chance in the 
foreseeable future. Yet, we need a solution fast. This is why 
I am hoping for the decision of the Federal Constitutional 
Court. In the election campaign I will of course clearly and 
outspokenly refute the SPD when it says that there is no 
difference to the coalition government in terms of foreign 
policy. This issue shows the most decisive difference, and it 
has to be emphasized; besides, the SPD is finding it difficult 
to make others believe what it says here; just look at 
Scharping's visit to Washington. 
  [Mueck] You yourself said recently that, in the future, 
Germany would more often say yes than no. Is there not the 
danger again -- and the German defense minister warned against 
it today -- of Germany embarking on a course leading back to 
isolation, new nationalism, special status? 
  [Kinkel] No, no. First of all, one has to say that the 
Bundeswehr has participated in all kinds of missions. Three 
such missions are to be the topic of this court procedure: 
Somalia, AWACS, and the Adriatic. Besides, we participate in 
the air drops and in the relief flights to Sarajevo; we are 
observers for the CSCE, and are engaged in many other spheres. 
One cannot say that the Bundeswehr does not do anything. In 
the humanitarian sphere, particularly as far as Yugoslavia is 
concerned, we are leading -- thank God. No, I do not see any 
danger of isolation. Our practice of being cautious -- I have 
said that in my statement today. Of course, we will have to say 
no much more often than yes in the future. This will not 
change. After all, I pointed out the high number of missions 
the United Nations are requesting today. We will not be able to 
participate in all of them -- for sheer problems of capacity. 
  [Mueck] When you speak of this practice of being cautious, 
which one can very well understand as a neighbor -- I am 
Austrian -- could one not say that it is a kind of fig leaf, an 
excuse for dodging all other things, and to send the alliance, 
the others, into the fire? 
  [Kinkel] I beg your pardon? First of all, we want the seat 
on the Security Council and, second, the Basic Law amendment so 
that we become capable of taking action, do not have to avoid 
responsibility, but that we commit ourselves in the community of 
peoples and in the United Nations in a way that is appropriate 
for a country of 80 million inhabitants. 
  [Mueck] Yesterday, the German federal president, with a view 
to Bosnia, very explicitly said that for him the Bosnian Serbs 
are nothing but ordinary war criminals. If one hears that 
abroad, then one wonders why people in Germany are now seriously 
discussing whether one can participate in AWACS missions. 
  [Kinkel] You cannot say it that way. Firstly, politically, 
we all wanted to participate in the AWACS missions. Only, the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Bundestag group voiced 
its legal reservations regarding the legal basis: Paragraph 87 
or 24 of the Basic Law. Second, we really did not shirk our 
responsibility in this connection -- but quite the contrary. In 
the future we want to help avoid such things. In Yugoslavia, we 
do have a special problem though as a result of historical 
events. So, even if the Basic Law had been amended and if we 
were able to participate in a mission under our constitution, 
there would probably -- that is my very personal opinion -- not 
be a majority in the German Bundestag for the participation of 
German soldiers in a mission in the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Mueck] Do you not have the impression that the scenario 
that is currently developing in the Balkans, including the 
stronger involvement of the superpowers, such as Russia, might 
not once more become a question of security for Germany, and 
that your defense policy will be challenged? 
  [Kinkel] No, not at all. I think that the Russians have 
acted most constructively so far. Without their possibilities 
of influencing the Serbian side, Sarajevo, Tuzla would not have 
been possible. Besides, you certainly heard what Kozyrev and 
Churkin said yesterday in connection with the behavior of the 
Serbs. The Serbs are the aggressors and they can obviously not 
be stopped and impressed by anything. As far as enforcing their 
policy is concerned they are obviously absolutely unscrupulous. 
They have to be told so, and we still need the Russians who 
have to bring their influence to bear, in the same way in which 
we need the U.S. influence on the Muslim side. 
  [Mueck] It cannot be ruled out that, maybe even today, 
Clinton will make higher demands on the Europeans and say: You 
have to do more than you did in the past. What will you tell 
him then? 
  [Kinkel] I will tell him that, so far, the Europeans have 
done much more than the Americans. I am happy about their 
commitment. The U.S. commitment is an air commitment, and an 
incredible political commitment, which we have always requested. 
It has helped bring about Muslim-Croatian rapprochement -- and 
we still have to get the Serbs into the boat. Yet, the ground 
forces -- this is where it is getting dangerous -- have been 
provided by the Europeans: 11,000 plus 13,000 men, which makes 
24,000 men. 
  [Mueck] But no Germans. 
  [Kinkel] No Germans. This is what is worrying us greatly, 
and what is sometimes making life so hard for me as foreign 
minister in meetings with my colleagues and partners.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mysterious Death in Libya"] </F>
  [Text] Being guessed at in the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV]: How did a high-ranking 
BfV official and his wife die in Libya? Silvian Becker, section 
head of BfV Department 6 (international terrorism), died in a 
military hospital in Tripoli the week before last. At the time 
of going to press, details of the circumstances, including the 
death of his wife, were still unknown to German officials; the 
bodies had not yet been released by Libya. 
  Becker had told the BfV in Cologne that he was going to 
Egypt 
for a vacation. A passenger car, which had obviously been used 
by the couple, was found undamaged in Tripoli. There is a basic 
ban on travel to Libya for all BfV employees. The BfV is 
wondering whether the tourists were kidnapped or enticed away 
from Egypt. Relatives claim that the Beckers went to Libya 
through Tunisia. The official was highly valued as an expert on 
the Middle East and northern Africa. His colleagues describe him 
as a "prudent man, and not an adventurous type." A double 
agent? "Very unlikely, if you knew him," it is said in Cologne.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "State Protection Confirms: PKK </F>
Blackmails Asylum-Seekers"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
warned against consequences for the German-Turkish relations if 
the Turks are indeed using German weapons in their fight against 
Kurds. Kinkel said the reports and documents presented by human 
rights groups will be evaluated. However, it will probably be 
difficult to prove the allegations. 
  Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz Eggert also threatened 
consequences if it turns out that reports about the arrest and 
torture of the Kurdish couple Ramazan and Zubeyde Cetin, who 
were deported to Turkey on 6 April, prove true. Lothar Hermes, 
spokesman of the Saxon Refugee Council, claims that he spoke 
with the Cetins on the telephone on Friday [15 April] and they 
told him about having been mistreated. Eggert expressed "most 
serious doubts" about such reports. If the allegations are 
confirmed, "then the entire discussion about the Kurds in 
Germany must be held in a new way." 
  The Berlin State Protection has confirmed reports by the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Ministry that the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan (PKK) is blackmailing asylum-seekers. A spokesman 
said the PKK intends to extort 20 million German marks from 
Kurds and Turks in Germany in 1994. 
  In the meantime, 210 ground-to-air missiles for Turkey were 
loaded on the freighter Kayseri near Stadersand on the Lower 
Elbe on Saturday. The loading was originally expected to take 
place in the free port of Hamburg. Protests occurred there, 
however.

<F P=106> ["wff"-signed report: "Bonn Clearly Reprimands European </F>
Parliament"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Federal Government seems to be very 
concerned that the laboriously negotiated enlargement of the 
European Union [EU] by Finland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden, 
which has been promoted primarily by Bonn, could not be agreed 
by the European Parliament [EP]. 
  German diplomats in Brussels think that this could result in 
a crisis within the EU. The mood in the Parliament does not 
reflect reality, they said, referring to critical voices in the 
Strasbourg assembly. There have even been voices saying that 
German commitment to the European unification process could 
decrease, if the European Parliament refuses its consent. The 
Parliament must also ask itself whether, in the event of its 
refusal, it will be granted additional rights during the 
conference scheduled to discuss further improvements of the 
Maastricht Treaty in 1996. 
  Without the approval of the European Parliament, which has 
to 
decide with the absolute majority of its 260 delegates, 
accession agreements cannot come into force. The ratification 
process will begin this week, with the EU Commission, the 
Council, and the Parliament meeting to discuss enlargement and 
the delegates addressing questions to the Commission and the 
Council afterwards. The 700 pages of the agreements were only 
presented to Parliament last week. The plenum will vote on them 
during its last session in May, before a new parliament is 
elected in mid-June. 
  Over the past few days, criticism within the European 
Parliament has increased. It not only concerns the late 
presentation of the texts, which makes assessment difficult for 
the delegates, but also the compromise on the voting procedure 
agreed to by the EU foreign ministers, which removed the last 
obstacles for enlargement. For some delegates, such as the 
French socialist, former Foreign Minister and EU Commissioner 
Claude Cheysson, the Ionnania compromise on the voting procedure 
is intolerable. Politicians of the European People's Party EVP 
(Christian Democrats), such as Belgian Fernand Herman or French 
Jean-Louis Bourlanges, pointed out that an agreement on 
enlargement might be difficult to achieve after the compromise. 
  Guenter Rinsche, chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union in the European Parliament, on the 
other hand, said that the historic opportunity of EU enlargement 
should not be missed. Also, he does not consider the compromise 
on the voting procedure to be the best solution, because it can 
make controlling the Community under exceptional circumstances 
difficult. Klaus Haensch, deputy chairman of the Social 
Democratic group, pointed out that the Parliament will make sure 
that there is no loophole opened for the right of veto to return.

  [Text] Talks between the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, and the German chancellor, Mr. Helmut Kohl, were held in 
Bonn today. The two leaders are understood to have discussed 
bilateral relations as well as regional and international 
issues. The talks were marked by extreme warmth and cordiality 
which are the hallmark of the relations between Pakistan and 
Germany. 
  During the talks, the prime minister is understood to have 
put forward a number of proposals for expanding economic 
cooperation between the two countries. She also briefed the 
chancellor about the latest situation in occupied Kashmir and 
reiterated Pakistan's firm belief that the Kashmir dispute could 
be resolved only by the grant of right of self-determination to 
the Kashmiris. She said Pakistan was ready to enter into a 
dialogue with India provided it lifts the siege of Hazratbal 
Shrine, puts an end to the ongoing repression, and considerably 
reduces the presence of its troops in occupied Kashmir. 
  The talks continued during the luncheon hosted by the German 
chancellor in honor of the prime minister.

<F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Minister Rexrodt Promotes Bonn as </F>
Seat of Future World Trade Organization"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn wants to apply for the headquarters of the 
new World Trade Organization (WTO), Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt announced on the sidelines of the signing of the new 
GATT agreement on liberalizing world trade in Marrakesh 
(Morocco). [passage omitted] 
  So far, Geneva has officially applied to house the new WTO. 
However, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told journalists 
that he wants to prepare the Federal Government's application 
for Bonn. If there are no reservations by the ministries 
concerned, the cabinet could decide on Bonn's application for 
the WTO headquarters before the summer recess, Rexrodt said. He 
wants to announce the German application in a letter to 
Sutherland in order to document Germany's interest in the WTO 
seat for the preparatory committee. 
  As a former capital, Bonn meets all the requirements, 
Rexrodt 
said, promoting his proposal. It has the necessary 
administrative and conference capacities, and most of the WTO 
countries already have diplomatic missions in Bonn. What also 
speaks in Bonn's favor is that no major international 
organization has its seat in Germany at the moment, which has a 
tradition of advocating free world trade and is one of the 
largest trading nations in the world. 
  The Swiss delegation in Marrakesh was astonished at 
Germany's 
interest in the WTO seat. The Swiss Government is taking Bonn's 
application, competing with Geneva, seriously. Experts say that 
trying to keep the WTO in Geneva might prove expensive for 
Switzerland. A new office building will also be needed in 
Geneva, because the existing GATT headquarters will be too small 
for the WTO. Sutherland wants to discuss conditions with the 
competitors over the next few months. In accordance with its 
share in world trade, Germany is paying some 12 percent toward 
the cost of GATT and the future WTO. The new organization is to 
start work as early as 1 January 1995.

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Ruehe Rejects Kinkel's </F>
Criticism"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- One day before the Constitutional Court 
deals with Bundeswehr missions outside NATO, Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) rejected the criticism 
by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) regarding the planned reduction of the Bundeswehr 
yesterday. In an interview with DIE WELT, Ruehe stated that the 
troops will become smaller and be reduced to about 340,000 
because "exercises and investments will again be possible." 
However, he added: "We reserve the right to 370,000 men." 
Kinkel insisted on a strength of 370,000 men. 
  The Chancellor's Office also pointed out that, 
internationally, Germany will reserve the right to 370,000 men. 
Ruehe's conceptional guidelines for the Bundeswehr that will be 
submitted to the defense working group of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] today are 
being supported by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and CDU/CSU Bundestag 
group leader Schaeuble. They stipulate a peacetime strength of 
320,000 to 340,000 men. They also provide for a military 
service of 10 months. 
  Ruehe told DIE WELT: "The weakening of the Bundeswehr is the 
result of expenditure cuts involving 2 billion German marks 
within 12 months. It is now important to strengthen the 
operational readiness of the Bundeswehr by optimizing the use of 
the money." The smaller armed forces will be given structures 
that make it possible to ensure a quick increase to 370,000 men.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernst Uhrlau, president of the Hamburg Land </F>
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, by Thomas Lillig; 
place and date not given: "Neo-Nazis as `Watchdogs' of the 
`Capitalist-Imperialist' System"] 
  [Text] [Lillig] Mr. Uhrlau, from which side in the 
left-wing extremist scene does the greatest danger emanate at 
the moment? 
  [Uhrlau] It depends on how you define danger. If you ask 
about a danger to the liberal democratic basic system, then none 
of the wide-branching groups are a danger because they are so 
negligible. If you look at the matter from the viewpoint of 
militant behavior -- that is, you include public security and 
order to a great extent -- then the autonomous groups naturally 
continue to be important for the FRG's security system. The 
respective activities of the autonomous groups are related to 
issues and related to specific occasions, however, with all the 
difficulties that are linked with these statements. If there 
are no issues, activities decline. This also weakens the 
structure. This means that the readiness for action always 
depends on specific issues. 
  [Lillig] Such a topic is "antifascism." How do you assess 
the struggle of "left against right?" 
  [Uhrlau] First, you have to proceed from the premise that 
the so-called militant antifascist struggle of the 1970's and 
1980's has an ideological foundation in the fact that "fascism" 
is inseparably linked with "capitalism" and that neo-Nazis and 
right-wing extremist parties that are not neo-Nazi parties are 
"henchmen" and "watchdogs" of the capitalist-imperialist system. 
And thus, for left-wing extremists, an attack on right-wing 
extremists is also a contribution to fighting against the system. 
  This conflict took place by means of publications, publicly, 
and also through militant actions. And within the framework of 
this so-called antifascist militant struggle there were arson 
attacks, bomb attacks, bodily injury, and material damage in the 
1980's -- a lot of material damage to cars --they were 
"flattened," as the scene said -- or material damage to the 
apartments of known right-wing extremists. The basis was the 
statement: "Hit the fascists where you meet them!" -- including 
fliers that were like wanted posters. And this was the situation 
in particular in the 1980's, a time when right-wing extremism 
did not play such a great role as in the 1990's. 
  This model has been taken over by the right-wing extremists 
as of 1992. The conflict of "right against left" has, however, 
not been able to develop this systematic action of the left-wing 
extremists or at least not fully develop it. One can see an 
east-west difference in the conflict between "right/left" and 
"left/right." In the west, there is a stronger conflict of "left 
against right" and in the east a stronger conflict of "right 
against left," which can be explained against the background of 
the different regional distribution of the militant left-wing 
extremist and right-wing extremist scene. 
  [Lillig] Well, one could assume that as long as they are 
busy with each other, they are not a danger to democracy. 
  [Uhrlau] These acts of violence are an expression of a basic 
rejection of the system. For left-wing extremism, neo-Nazis or 
right-wing extremist parties and their members are something 
that must be attacked within the framework of the struggle 
against the system in order to weaken the system, to restrict 
fascism, which is growing stronger from their point of view: 
active participation, since the state cannot be expected to 
purposefully contain the right-wing extremists because of its 
nature as an "accomplice." 
  For the right-wing extremists, including the skinheads, it 
also has something to do with the changed self-confidence, with 
the changed strength of these groups. This is then partly 
headed by the slogan "against antinational forces" to find 
broader space for their own activities and also space for their 
claim about themselves. All this has a very elementary effect 
on the self-understanding of our democracy, namely that no one 
must use violent means to enforce his political positions. In 
this respect, the conflict between the two groups is, at the 
same time, also an attack on essential elements of our 
democratic system. 
  [Lillig] Let us return to the "mobilization" in the 
extremist struggle against each other: One could read In a news 
magazine that "leftist" and "rightists" are even shooting at 
each other. Is it to be expected that the militant "left/right 
struggle" will continue to amplify itself? 
  [Uhrlau] These conflicts have never been distinguished by 
particular peacefulness. In justifying the militant "antifascist 
struggle," individual persons have certainly explained why, in a 
conflict with neo-Nazis, one has to condone the fact that one 
may have "to cross the Wupper" [get killed]. This is not the 
goal, but it if happens the left-wing extremists do not grieve, 
either. It is not an intention, but it is a result that is 
condoned. 
  In the actions of "right against left," "left" need not 
necessarily mean "left-wing extremist." From the viewpoint of 
the "rightists," anyone who is not a supporter of national 
concepts and policy can be a "tick." This can be someone who 
refuses to say that Adolf Hitler is the greatest statesman of 
all times. And as a result of this initially verbal conflict, 
he will then be beaten and may be killed. 
  This very brutal act, which is not controlled by a relation 
between the goal and the means used to achieve it, certainly 
influences the discussion among autonomous groups in relatiom to 
the rightists. They say that the rightists are contemptuous of 
people and hurt them. And then, in their view, one does not 
need a political argument, but "antifascist resistance" is 
"violent resistance." 
  [Lillig] A completely different question: What do you say 
to the accusation that the state protects the "rightists" while 
acting against the "leftists" with excessive toughness? The 
accusation is, for instance, raised during "leftist" 
demonstrations against "rightist" party events, when the police 
protects the party followers against those who protest. 
  [Uhrlau] The state protect the law. A party that holds a 
party congress -- which it is obligated to do, by party law -- a 
party congress that includes the naming of candidates or an 
election rally of a right-wing extremist party that runs for 
elections -- these events must be held, because if the state 
cannot enforce the right to the freedom of association, this 
would mean that any claim to a right would be arbitrary. 
  This does not mean that the state accepts and must accept 
everything regarding the activities of rightist organizations 
and parties. For instance: In the election campaign in 
Hamburg, the "National List" tried with the most varied excuses 
to hold demonstrations, which were rejected by the 
administrative courts in both first and second instances. Thus, 
there were no demonstrations. It was assumed that such 
demonstrations would lead to crimes or would make it impossible 
to guarantee security and order. There were comprehensive bans 
on demonstrations all over the country. 
  Quite another question is whether and where the right-wing 
extremists managed to get around extensive police barriers, also 
by using state-of-the-art communications technology, to turn up 
briefly but spectacularly in a completely different place and 
only with a fraction of those who were wiling to demonstrate. 
This was the case in Fulda and in Rudolstadt in 1992. This 
does not mean that the state let the "rightists" do what they 
want and those who oppose right-wing extremism are pushed away 
by the police. The available instruments are used very 
consistently against right-wing extremism. 
  [Lillig] Why does the state then permit organizations that 
are hostile to the constitution to act at all? Why does it give 
them -- event though unintentionally and unplanned -- a forum 
instead of banning them? 
  [Uhrlau] In a democracy, bans are always the last resort of 
state action because the instrument that is appropriate for a 
democracy is political argument. And only when certain 
developments and phenomena are no longer acceptable, when the 
advantages of a ban are greater for the community than the 
disadvantages and the restrictions on political activities, only 
then do bans make any sense. Regarding the neo-Nazi 
organizations -- and this also applies to two parties, for which 
an application for a ban has been made -- the point was to show 
that the acceptable threshold had been crossed, also in view of 
the very young people who were interested. 
  [Lillig] What is the strategy of left-wing extremist forces 
to affect society? How do they exert their influence, what are 
their topics, how do they communicate with each other? 
  [Uhrlau] In contrast to the 1970's, the topics are no longer 
large global issues. The issues are more regional and local, 
relating more directly to experiences so that more people get 
involved in the issues -- issues such as antifascism, the 
improvement of city districts, or the struggle for peace. 
  The spreading of one's own position takes place via 
publications of the scene. They are very varied, very colorful, 
have rather small print runs, and for the authors these 
publications are their entire world. Then there is also the 
possibility to call attention to a certain topic by 
demonstrative actions, for instance by carrying out attacks or 
staging demonstrations. This is how the issues get into the 
press. When you think of Berlin, for instance, this setting 
fire to luxury cars, this destruction of shops for so-called 
prosperous people. 
  [Lillig] Is there an international network in left-wing 
extremism? 
  [Uhrlau] Given the left-wing extremism's own claim, it must 
be internationalist. What existed in the past within the 
framework of bipolarity, with a firm ideological center in 
Moscow, a minor center in Beijing, and perhaps another one in 
Tirana, and then a revolutionary center some place in Latin 
America for other groups -- this is largely a thing of the past. 
However, a real network, while preserving independence and a 
uniting for actions, did not exist in this form. If there is 
dependence, you do not have a network. 
  In many demonstrations -- also of the autonomous science, 
which also has its internationalist struggle -- we have 
repeatedly had representatives of other countries, also as 
speakers, but these have been ties that were always very much 
related to a specific project, a specific object, and specific 
persons. When the people from Hamburg had contacts with 
Copenhagen, these were contacts at the level of squatters. For 
that there was solidarity, togetherness, perhaps also joint 
action at international economic summits or EC summits, or 
whatever. But we cannot see this as an expression of a common 
strategy, of common action. 
  [Lillig] In conclusion, one question about Constitutional 
Protection: Is it sufficient what Constitutional Protection is 
doing to combat extremism? 
  [Uhrlau] Clearly yes. Our instruments, both in terms of 
laws and personnel, are basically sufficient. 
  [Lillig] Constitutional Protection has been variously 
criticized and its efficiently in combating extremism has been 
called into question. It has been said that the activists of 
the authorities are too restricted to collecting and evaluating 
information -- but they are prohibited from acting. 
  [Uhrlau] Our assignment -- and you described that correctly 
-- is to collect and evaluate information. We are, therefore, 
an instrument of analysis. We are not an executive authority. 
And our activities are largely related to the nonmilitant area. 
As an instrument of analysis we are not the ones who make 
arrests; we are not permitted to do that; there is the clear 
command of separation of powers. However, with the information 
we gather and the analysis we make, we can enable others to act 
-- to prevent acts of violent and riots. 
  We are not an instrument to prohibit thinking. It is the 
assignment of the Constitutional Protection authorities -- in 
particular as a part of a democracy that can defend itself -- to 
provide the governments with information and impressions about 
forces that operate against the liberal democratic basic system. 
Trying to link that to issues of criminal prosecution bypasses 
the actual task of Constitutional Protection.

<F P=106> [Report by "k.h.": "Use Intelligence Services"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- Eckart Werthebach, president of the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], has 
come out in favor of using the intelligence services also to 
combat organized crime. At an international expert conference 
of the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation about the responsibilities of 
police and intelligence services in the democratic rule-of-law 
state, Werthebach said in the Berlin Reichstag that this 
expansion of authority must be decided by politics. It would 
preserve the separation of powers and the independence of police 
and intelligence services. As the representative of the police, 
Leopold Schuster, head of the Counternarcotic Department in the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], objected to 
Werthebach's statements. Expanding the tasks of the 
intelligence services is not absolutely necessary, he said. In 
addition, there are constitutional obstacles to it. 
  Werthebach justified his proposal by saying that the BfV has 
experience in counterespionage and in keeping an eye on both 
national and international underground terrorist movements. His 
office is better equipped in terms of "means of surveillance" 
than the police. The precondition for taking over the task of 
combating crime is an increase in personnel as well as an 
amendment to the Federal Constitutional Protection Law. 
Werthebach sees potential work for the BfV in observing 
organized crime structures that might exert influence over the 
media. It is urgently necessary to harmonize the methods and 
legal bases of intelligence services all over Europe. In 
addition, in Germany there is no central interlocutor for the 
European intelligence services. Werthebach said that currently 
the most dangerous form of organized crime is the illegal 
transport of radioactive substances from the CIS into West 
Europe. 
  Schuster explained his rejection of BfV cooperation by 
saying 
that preinvestigations are usual in the police and not a 
privilege of the intelligence services. Rather, in view of 
about 7 million crimes in 1993, the BKA is forced to cope with 
"considerable problems regarding resources." In order to 
"comprehensively" combat organized crime, the BKA demands the 
authority of a central body. According to Schuster, last year 
there were 776 investigations of 10,000 individuals suspected of 
involvement in organized crime.

<F P=106> [Report by Hannes Koch: "Dasa Has Alternatives to </F>
Eurofighter"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- While Deutsche Aerospace AG (Dasa) is 
still calling loudly for the construction of the disputed 
European fighter "Eurofighter 2000" in public, the corporation 
is working with great concentration on alternative civilian 
projects. The Daimler-Benz subsidiary is taking precautions for 
the event that a red-green government will cancel the plane 
after the Bundestag elections in October. This is reported by 
armament opponents about a talk with Juergen Schrempp, chairman 
of the Dasa board of directors. 
  After the talk about potential conversion from military to 
civilian production, Juergen Graesslin, spokesman of the 
critical shareholders of Daimler-Benz, quoted Dasa chief 
Schrempp as saying: "We have civilian projects in the drawer 
just in case the political framework conditions change." 
Wolfgang Piller, who is responsible for company planning, 
pointed to the intensive Dasa activities "in the fields of 
energy production, energy storage, and energy distribution, such 
as photovoltaic systems and electrolysis." Graesslin's summary: 
"Dasa can manage without the Eurofighter." 
  Officially, on the other hand, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary 
Dasa continues to urge the construction of the fighter and is 
trying to get additional money out of the project. Only 
recently the Federal Government received an additional demand of 
570 million German marks [DM] for the development of the 
Eurofighter. The armament program, which is estimated at DM50 
billion, would help Dasa overcome its economic difficulties. 
For 1993 alone the corporation suffered a three-digit billion 
figure in losses in its central sectors of armament and aviation. 
  Speaking to DIE TAGESZEITUNG, Dasa spokesman Detmar 
Grosse-Leege pointed out that the "total loss" of a new fighter 
plane "cannot be compensated." In this case, the corporation 
threatens to dismiss employees to an extent that would exceed 
the announced reduction of 10,000 of the total 80,000 jobs. 
  In the meantime, Dasa has been forced to reduce armament 
production, because the Bundeswehr has less and less money to 
spend on new weapons. While in the 1992 business year DM6.4 
billion -- 37 percent of a turnover of DM17.3 billion -- was 
made with grenades, missiles, and military planes, currently the 
military share accounts for only 25 percent, according to the 
corporation. Last year 4,500 jobs were shifted from military to 
civilian production, the corporation reports. It cannot be 
overlooked that the company is increasingly getting involved in 
environmental protection. Thus, the Dasa subsidiary Dornier in 
Friedrichshafen is producing facilities for water purification 
and draws up expert reports for environmental-compatibility 
tests. The radar and radio production sector in Ulm is 
equipping towns with computer-controlled waste bins, which 
weight the weight of the waste and calculate individual waste 
disposal fees. 
  Dasa intends to restructure parts of the corporation into 
so-called profit centers this year. "With this strategy it is 
intended to strengthen civilian production," Dasa spokesman 
Andreas Breitsprecher says. An employee of the company from 
Ulm, who does not want to give his name, gives an example of the 
effect of the restructuring: So far, the development costs for 
radar equipment were very high because the Bundeswehr ordered 
the equipment and also bought it and paid practically any price. 
This "military cost structure" makes it extremely difficult to 
compete with other suppliers of radar equipment for orders from 
civilian airports. In the future, this should be remedied by 
nine profit centers in Ulm: The parts of the company are taken 
out of the corporation's hierarchy and are responsible for their 
profits themselves. They cannot hide any losses in the overall 
corporation and are thus put under pressure to reduce costs. 
This creates the conditions for being competitive on civilian 
markets. 
  Dieter Rueckgauer, head of environmental planning in 
Friedrichshafen, hopes he will be able to hire additional 
employees for the sales department within the framework of the 
profit center. So far, the experts deal with sales themselves. 
The reason for the neglect: Raising profits in marginal areas, 
such as environmental planning, was of little interest, because 
the lion's share of turnover was achieved in the central sectors 
of armament and aviation anyway. 
  Dasa's dual strategy becomes obvious here, too: It is 
intended to establish profit centers not only in the civilian 
but also in the military sector. Because competition is 
increasing also on the market for military technology -- the 
weapons corporation must gain the upper hand over other 
suppliers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Friedemann </F>
Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: "Waigel: Tax Reform 
in Summer -- But Without Tax Raises"] 
  [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] There is an ongoing quarrel about 
taxes in the coalition. Will the solidarity surcharge be 
limited to three years after all, as has been suggested by the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]? 
  [Waigel] No. In the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], the 
FDP, and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
unanimously adopted the solidarity surcharge without any 
limitation. Revenues of about 30 billion German marks [DM] per 
year are necessary for the foreseeable future because of the 
burdens caused by the fund for repaying debts inherited from the 
GDR. It would be unprincipled to say now that the solidarity 
surcharge can be abolished by this or that date. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] The Federal Constitutional Court demands 
that the government no longer tax the subsistence level. When 
will you accordingly reduce taxes? And where is the money for 
this measure to come from? 
  [Waigel] The current transition regulation has made the 
subsistence level exempt from taxes until the end of 1995 
anyway. For the final regulation, which the court demands as of 
1996, I have established a committee to work out proposals. 
Before the summer recess I will also present our tax policy 
concept for the next four years. This includes, among other 
things, improvements in the equalization of burdens for families 
and the continuation of the corporate tax reform. All that must 
be financed through savings and subsidies cutbacks. Neither tax 
increases nor an increase in new debts must be used for this 
purpose. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Not an increase in the inheritance tax, 
either? 
  [Waigel] Most definitely not. Inheritances will not be 
further taxed by changing the bases for assessment. Even if the 
Federal Constitutional Court were to force us to change the 
basic values, I want to compensate that with tax-exempt amounts 
or by reducing the tax rates. I do not want additional taxes 
for the heirs. Otherwise, there would be considerable problems, 
in particular in medium-sized businesses, not least of all in 
agriculture and forestry. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Transportation Minister Wissmann has 
announced a "careful" increase in petroleum tax and is preparing 
road use fees. Does he really need DM8 billion more as of 1996? 
  [Waigel] As of 1996 there is indeed a gap of DM8 billion in 
financing railroad reform. I leave it, as agreed, to clever 
traffic politicians to close this gap. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] The FDP has made its coalition statement in 
favor of the CDU/CSU. Material demands are to follow. Will you 
accept conditions for continuing the coalition? 
  [Waigel] The FDP can make demands as an independent party, 
but so can we. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] So can we. [as published] 
  [Waigel] We demand a correction in legal and domestic policy 
with the introduction of the great bugging campaign so that in 
the future the police will be permitted to monitor discussions 
of new serious crimes. We will insist on that. If the FDP is 
smart, it will already decide to agree to the great bugging 
campaign at its next party congress, in time before the 
elections. I also expect the FDP to vote for our candidate 
Roman Herzog by the third ballot of the elections for the German 
president at the latest. This would be a very positive signal 
for the coalition. In addition, the FDP would be well advised 
if, next week, it were to withdraw its complaint in Karlsruhe 
against Bundeswehr participation in NATO AWACS flights. Then the 
foreign minister can finally openly advocate the policy he 
really wants instead of continuing to sue his own government in 
the highest German court. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] In your opinion, has the SPD's candidate for 
the chancellor's office, Scharping, been able to improve his 
prospects of being elected as a result of his trip to the United 
States? 
  [Waigel] Certainly not, he just followed Helmut Kohl. But 
at least now he knows how great Helmut Kohl's reputation is in 
the world. On the other hand, Scharping was reproached by the 
U.S. Treasury because of his unbidden comments on U.S. monetary 
policy. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] The CSU is in a slump. Will Edmund Stoiber 
remain Bavarian minister president? 
  [Waigel] Yes. Edmund Stoiber is and remains minister 
president with my full support. One cannot blame the current 
situation on him. He has acted correctly and he is doing very 
well. I am sure that we will get out of the slump and return to 
sober discussion of real problems. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Will there not be a discussion about 
personnel in the CSU even if your party gets bad results at the 
European elections? 
  [Waigel] No, not even then. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Do you agree to Bavaria's demand to cancel 3 
October as a public holiday to finance nursing care insurance? 
  [Waigel] There are differing ideas on this matter. Everyone 
knows that, for instance, the chancellor and the CDU are against 
that. I do not see any prospects of success for this proposal. 
It will not be possible to push through the cancellation of the 
3 October holiday.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Erich Hauser: "Marrakesh and the Aftermath"] </F>
  [Text] The paths of future world trade are going to be 
mapped in the former Moroccan trade center Marrakesh in the next 
few days. The climax of the several-day meeting of ministers 
from over 120 countries should be the official signing of all 
the GATT agreements that were hailed in December by the apostles 
of international free trade as the "successful conclusion" of 
the seven-year so-called Uruguay Round of talks. 
  Whether every single minister will know exactly what he is 
signing is a matter of doubt. There are no less than 28 new 
agreements, which, with all the annexes and appendices, add up 
to 20,000 pages of print. International economic dealing has 
long become the domain of world enterprises, pressure groups, 
and specialists sitting in bureaucratic ministries or inside 
bodies like the European Union [EU] Commission. All the 
politicians can do is lay down the general line of march. The 
complexity of the mutual interdependencies makes democratic 
control almost impossible. 
  When the new agreements are ratified by the majority of the 
120 countries next year, over the 10 following years there will 
be a gradual mutual "opening up of markets" not just to trade, 
but also to public works and services, which will alter the 
lives of millions of people on all continents. For the first 
time, agriculture and, as part of technological progress, the 
broadcast media, telecommunications, transportation, and much 
else besides will be affected. The losers will be the poorest 
developing countries that cannot feed themselves. 
  Skeptics fear that the new agreements contain too many 
loopholes for countries that, under pressure form high 
unemployment, might want to pull out of the strong international 
competition. The GATT that was created in 1948 is to be 
converted into a "World Trade Organization" (WTO) with tougher 
rules. 
  To prevent the Marrakesh meeting from being overshadowed by 
intense disputes, it has been agreed to continue the work over 
the next 24 months. When the Uruguay talks began eight years 
ago at the inspiration of U.S. President Reagan, the world was 
still quite different from today. In the old Western 
industrialized countries, including Japan, technological 
progress has eliminated more and more jobs since then. The high 
chronic unemployment is making West European social security 
systems virtually impossible to finance. The technological 
competitiveness of many low-wage countries has increased 
markedly, and with the "opening of markets" it will exert an 
even stronger wage pressure in the old industrialized countries. 
The EU countries now have a moral duty to gradually integrate 
the "new market economies" of East Europe. What is more, China, 
as the world's most populous country, has made such progress in 
the development of its increasingly capitalist economy that in 
10 to 15 years it will have overtaken not only Germany, but also 
Japan and the United States as a world trade partner. 
  No wonder the trade unions of North America and West Europe 
are now demanding that a "social clause" be added to the new 
world trade regulations. Countries in which trade unions are 
suppressed and minimum ILO regulations, such as a ban on the 
employment of children, are violated should be excluded from the 
mutual opening up of markets. 
  The developing countries have already vehemently opposed 
such 
a "social clause" in Marrakesh. Their rich elites are using 
their people's "poverty," from which they profit the most, as an 
argument against "discrimination." Environmental protection was 
also completely "overlooked" in the Uruguay talks. High 
environmental standards are considered a cost factor that apply 
mostly to those countries that enjoy a high standard of living. 
If the industries of these countries consider themselves too 
much at a disadvantage in free world trade, they pull out. The 
only explanation for the great "joy" in Germany over the success 
of the Uruguay talks is the fact that economic interests and 
their prophets dominate this country. 
  The Marrakesh accords are a late victory for the already 
anachronistic "Reaganomics" ideology. It is ironic that many 
hopes are now being vested in the U.S. Congress. It is the most 
unusual of Western parliaments because its majority is not 
obliged to support the U.S. Government. Washington is virtually 
the only capital that could belatedly force through an 
environmental clause and a social clause in the WTO. The 
apostles of free trade might scream blue murder about "new 
protectionism," but this might salvage Germany's important 
achievements.

  [Text] Hendaye, France, April 19 (AFP) -- Fifteen Spanish 
fishing boats blockaded this southwestern port on Tuesday [19 
April] as tension remained high after a battle between 60 
Spanish and 12 French vessels. 
  The French gunboat Commandant l'Herminier patrolled 
off-shore 
after arriving in the middle of the night from its Britanny base 
in Lorient. 
  The fifteen anchovy fishing boats were aiming to prevent 
French trawlers from sailing on Tuesday. Other vessels were 
stationed out at sea to prevent sailings from nearby 
Saint-Jean-de-Luz and Bayonne, southwestern France. 
  A flotilla of 60 Spanish boats from Fuenterrabia, across the 
border from here, attacked the 12 French trawlers on Monday for 
exceeding their anchovy quota. The French quota is 2,700 tonnes 
a year and the Spanish 27,000 tonnes. 
  One French boat, the Laetitia, was seized and towed with its 
crew to Fuenterrabia where an angry crowd burned its nets and 
destroyed its navigation equipment. 
  The Spanish started fires on three of the French ships, 
hurling petrol bombs and trying to board them after throwing 
grappling irons. Spanish fishermen said nine of their boats 
were damaged. 
  In Paris Tuesday, French Fisheries Minister Jean Puech 
conceded that the French fishermen should respect their quotas, 
but said that Spanish fishermen had no right to enforce European 
Union rules in French waters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse and </F>
newly appointed head of the majority's list for the European 
elections, by Anne Fulda and Joseph Mace-Scaron; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LE FIGARO] How did you react 
to the remarks made by some members of the Republican Party 
after your appointment? 
  [Baudis] Without great surprise. Whenever there is a new 
and rather unexpected element in public life, that always 
provokes some trouble and turmoil. That is inevitable. 
Moreover, the media world is such that negative remarks are 
taken up and reported more readily than positive remarks or 
encouragements. There have nonetheless been more encouragements 
than reservations! For some sections of the media, the result 
was a surprise. 
  I understand there bitterness. When you support a candidate, 
you always find it difficult to accept that he was not chosen, 
especially because Jean-Francois Deniau is a man of great 
qualities. If I had not been appointed, my friends would have 
felt sadness or bitterness. It is human and logical. There is 
no reason to be surprised about it or to overdramatize things. 
  [LE FIGARO] In addition to this surprise, some members of 
the RPR [Rally for the Republic] are likely to be sparing in 
their support. 
  [Baudis] No, I am convinced that the majority parties will 
support and actively participate in the campaign. All the 
leaders have told me that. Just as the prime minister assured 
me of the government's support. 
  [LE FIGARO] What do you think of the "other majority list," 
that of Philippe de Villiers? 
  [Baudis] It is not another majority list, it is a dissident 
list whose approach is violently anti-European, radically 
different from the policy pursued by the government and 
supported by the majority. There is a single majority list and 
you will see in the next few days that this fact will be 
confirmed by all the political officials. 
  Any other list is an attempt at division which hampers the 
majority and seeks to weaken it. I would like to add that our 
list is open to the different currents of thinking which coexist 
within the majority, it is a union list. 
  What is interesting is that, in this election, we will see 
other lists whose candidates will all have voted yes or all have 
voted no in the Maastricht referendum. The only list which will 
be open to people who voted yes and people who voted no will be 
ours. This list will be the best reflection of France. 
and Moscow, as well as Riyadh, Muscat, and Abu Dhabi.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by Jacques </F>
Fleury, Thierry Oberle, and Ivan Rioufol; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [LE FIGARO] Algerians are 
starting to flee their country and come to France. Does this 
worry you? 
  [Pasqua] So far, the exodus you mention has not occurred. 
We have gone from 104 applications for asylum in 1992 to a 
little more than 1,000 last year. It is obvious that if the 
situation in Algeria were to worsen, we would probably receive 
more requests. 
  [LE FIGARO] If the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] comes to 
power in Algeria, there will be many people requesting asylum in 
France. Are you prepared to accept them? 
  [Pasqua] There is no reason why the FIS should gain power in 
Algeria. France wants Algeria to find the economic and 
political means of solving its problems. This depends on 
discussions between the government and its existing opponents. 
It is out of the question for us to accept a flood of people 
coming from Algeria. We would not be in a position to accept 
several tens of thousands of people. 
  [LE FIGARO] But will these exiles not be able to take 
advantage of the right of asylum? 
  [Pasqua] The right of asylum is an individual right, whereas 
you refer to an exodus of a population. We would obviously 
accept those who have French nationality. Those with dual 
nationality will have to justify their claim. 
  Aside from these exiles, we have no obligations, or else we 
will have to accept half the world! Moreover, if this problem 
was raised, it should be examined not in the framework of our 
own country, but in that of the Mediterranean countries and at 
the level of the European Union. Italy, Spain, and France would 
face the same problem. We cannot be the natural receptacle for 
all the oppressed, all the persecuted, all oppositionists. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you take seriously an Islamic fundamentalist 
threat in France? 
  [Pasqua] The government's role is to take seriously any 
possible threats. Moreover, it is in this spirit that we 
launched a preventive operation against FIS supporters in Paris 
and in central France, which has resulted in the destabilization 
of that organization. 
  We have carried out the same operation with regard to the 
Kurds. We will do it with regard to others if necessary. All 
groups which might carry out violent or unlawful actions in our 
country are obviously kept under surveillance. But, for the 
time being, there is no Islamic fundamentalist threat in France. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you interpret the recent arrest in Lille 
of two alleged FIS supporters? 
  [Pasqua] I take these arrests very seriously. We will now 
try to unravel the question, which is the natural role of the 
legal system and the police. [passage omitted] 
  [LE FIGARO] In Corsica, is the dialogue with the 
nationalists not a failure, since the terrorist campaign 
continues? 
  [Pasqua] Do you have a better policy? The aim is not to 
have dialogue with the nationalists, but primarily to give 
Corsica the necessary means for its economic development. 
Corsica is the first region of France to sign the state-region 
reorganization law. We are now preparing the revenue bill, 
which will be presented to Parliament sometime in May. I think 
that there is a very broad agreement in Corsica on this 
legislation and on the development measures, including circles 
close to the nationalists. The arrest of the Sperone commando 
was a serious blow to the nationalists, but it will not lead to 
their disappearance. This kind of actions will be halted 
through a series of measures, the weariness of the population, 
and, finally, a new awareness by all the nationalists, or at 
least by the most responsible ones. But all attacks must not be 
lumped together. There is a good proportion of crime and 
racketeering. I have given the police instructions and 
resources, and we are beginning to have results. [passage 
omitted].

<F P=106> [Report by Eric Zemmour: "Pasqua, the Reasons for His </F>
Anger"] 
  [Excerpt] The conflict between the interior minister and 
the justice minister is a classic of French political theater. 
But, this time, it is the whole of Edouard Balladur's policy 
which is being questioned by Charles Pasqua, who is determined 
to show his strength one year before the presidential election. 
  For a long time Charles Pasqua was Balladur's favorite. In 
spring 1993, the prime minister gave him priority in legislative 
matters during those famous "first 100 days," beyond which, it 
seems, reforms are more difficult to implement. He supported 
him with his full weight in the battle which the interior 
minister launched against the Constitutional Council on the 
right of asylum. And when Charles Pasqua, wearing his second 
hat, that of regional development, launched a "tour of France," 
Edouard Balladur immediately joined him. Charles Pasqua was at 
the time presented as the deputy prime minister. With a 
vocation to take over the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's 
office] once Balladur was installed in the Elysee [presidential 
palace]. The "honeymoon" period is over. Charles Pasqua is not 
an enthusiastic supporter of the Balladur method. Without 
saying so publicly, he thinks that the government is backing 
down too much, too often, and is not bold enough. In his 
introductory speech on his immigration laws, he had explained 
that it was necessary to coordinate with other ministries, 
responsible for justice, urban policy, and so forth. 
  However, one year later, Charles Pasqua can see that this 
has 
not happened. That is why he attacked the judges who snubbed 
him by bringing back the two young Algerians to Lyons, and 
through them, he attacked Justice Minister Pierre Mehaignerie. 
That is why he is also attacking urban policy -- or rather the 
lack of it -- and Simone Veil, the minister responsible, when he 
says: "The police cannot be society's road sweeper. Economic, 
social, and cultural life must be restored to these districts 
and they must no longer be abandoned to their fate, like ghettos 
within national territory." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard report: "Americans and Europeans </F>
Opposed Over Plan for Military Transport Plane"] 
  [Text] The United States and the European countries are 
engaged in a "show of strength" over a plan for a new military 
transport plane. "The FTP [Future Transport Plane] program (a 
European program intended to replace the Transall plane) 
directly competes with the U.S. aeronautics industry which 
clearly wants it to fail," Albert Voilquin, senator for Les 
Vosges, said in a report published on Tuesday, 12 April, and 
devoted to the future of military air transport in France. 
  From 2003 onward, France is due to replace its Transall 
planes, which were put into service in 1967 and some of which 
were modernized after 1981. According to Mr. Voilquin, 
requirements are for a fleet of planes capable of carrying 950 
tonnes over a distance of 7,000 km or 1,500 tonnes over a 
distance of 1000 km according to the mission selected. In all, 
this fleet should comprise between 60 and 70 planes. 
  Six European countries -- Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and 
Portugal, in addition to France -- have come together to design 
a plane known as FTP, and two other European countries -- 
Belgium and Britain -- are participating as observers (allowing 
their industrial groups -- Flabel and British Aerospace -- to 
fund their own investment without the assurance of a national 
order). 
<H5>  Doubts About Britain </H5>
  The FTP program has been revised and amended several times 
with the aim of considerably reducing the costs. Today, on the 
basis of a total requirement of around 300 planes, the overall 
cost is estimated at around 188 billion francs [Fr], Fr50 
billion of which to be contributed by France (less than the 
development cost of the Rafale, Mr. Voilquin points out). "If 
we build a European plane," the senator writes, "we give French 
industry the opportunity of producing the equivalent of 500 
A-320 Airbus planes, in other words, more than 33 million hours 
of work and more than 5,000 jobs per year over 20 years." 
  Before giving preference to this solution, France has 
examined the possibility of buying existing or proposed planes 
from abroad. Some, like the Boeing 747 cargo or the A-340 Airbus 
are not in their present form suited to the transportation in 
their holds of heavy or light armored vehicles and helicopters, 
even if they are partly dismantled. Others, like the American 
C-17 are too expensive. Yet others, like the Ilyushin 76 or the 
Antonov 124, have many technical and commercial drawbacks. And 
finally the development of others, like the Antonov 77, has been 
halted. 
  That is why France supports the European FTP program with 
17.8 percent of the funding. In October 1993, the plane entered 
what is know as its feasability phase, which involves a spending 
of Fr50 million by the French side. "If the FTP does not see 
the light of day, the European countries' air forces, which will 
sooner or later have to renew their transport fleets, will be 
forced to buy outside Europe. The European aeronautical 
industry would be likely to lose a large part of its 
technological capabilities and Europe a part of its 
independence," Albert Voilquin notes. 
  The Europeans' camp could be divided in face of an offer by 
the United States which is leading by putting on the market the 
latest version of the Hercules (the C-130J) produced by the 
Lockheed group and to which the British seem particularly 
sensitive. In a 48-page report which has just been published in 
London, the House of Commons suggests the "off-the-shelf" 
purchase of 30 C-130J planes to start the replacement of the 
British fleet of 60 Hercules planes, while advising the general 
staffs to take into consideration the European FTP for the 
remaining 30 planes next century. 
  Analyzing the "trial of strength" which will start on both 
sides of the Atlantic, the senator thinks that European industry 
is probably "fighting for its survival" in this affair. The 
British Government therefore holds in its hands the fate of the 
FTP program. In 1989, the United Kingdom withdrew officially 
from the European project, authorizing British Aerospace, its 
aeronautical constructor, to continue to be included in it at 
its own financial risk. 
  "The implementation of the FTP program would be a strong 
symbol of the success of the gradual creation of European 
defense cooperation. Its failure would be a failure for 
Europe," Mr. Voilquin writes, assessing at 20,000 the number of 
jobs which could thus be created in Europe.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jacques Amalric: "An American-Russian </F>
Failure"] 
  [Text] The war in Bosnia and the capture of Gorazde, 
Warren Christopher said on Monday [18 April], are "the greatest 
tragedy Europe has seen since the establishment of the Iron 
Curtain." He could have added, without being wrong, that is is 
also the greatest American-Russian failure since the breakup of 
the Soviet Union. Washington and Moscow, which in January urged 
the Europeans to allow them to handle the Bosnian crisis 
immediately after NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs to secure the 
lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, have in fact allowed 
themselves to be misled by vague Serbian promises which have 
been immediately repudiated on the ground. The fall of Gorazde, 
an area theoretically protected by the United Nations but in 
which there were only four UN observers at the start of the 
Serbian offensive, is the result of this bluff whose 
consequences will not go unnoticed outside Bosnia: Russia, 
which flattered itself on having returned to the forefront of 
the international stage thanks to its last-minute intervention 
in the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, now seems like a rather 
unreliable partner. As for President Clinton's United States, 
it will have to add Gorazde to its failures in Somalia and Haiti 
unless there are later favorable developments. It is likely 
that the lesson will not go unnoticed in Baghdad and Pyongyang. 
  The biggest mistake on the part of the Americans was 
probably 
to have underestimated their power to intimidate the Serbs by 
trying to destabilize them before recognizing them as 
unavoidable interlocutors. The first act in this play was the 
formation of the Croatian-Muslim federation of Bosnia, which 
implied a cease-fire between the two sides and hence the 
possibility for the Bosnian Serbs to face a Muslim offensive 
aimed at forcibly recapturing some of the territories under 
Serbian control. The second act in the scenario consisted of 
Washington not demanding that the Muslims give details of their 
territorial claims, which was bound to increase the fears of the 
Bosnian Serbs who were invited by the Americans, 
unrealistically, to join the Croatian-Muslim federation. 
  It is in this situation of expectation that the Serbs -- 
those in Belgrade and those in Pale, according to the French and 
British intelligence services -- decided to test the Americans' 
resolution by launching an offensive against Gorazde at the end 
of March. No doubt to their great surprise, they then heard the 
American chief of staff and defense secretary explaining that 
Gorazde could not be saved by force. That was a huge mistake, 
reminiscent of the one made by President Truman when he forgot 
to mention Korea in the list of areas representing a vital 
interest for the United States. What came thereafter is 
well-known: A few air strikes frighten the Serbs no more than 
President Clinton's statements trying to erase the blunders of 
his aides. [Bosnian Serb Army commander] Gen. Mladic's troops 
are continuing their advance on Gorazde, while clearly showing 
the UN forces that they are merely potential hostages. It was 
known in Pale and in Belgrade that the United States is not 
credible because it refuses any presence on the ground and that 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], just a few thousand strong, does 
not have the means, the will, or the international mandate 
necessary to halt the offensive. Moreover, last Friday Bill 
Clinton admitted that by saying he was hostile to an extension 
of the war and a modification of the "military balance" by 
international forces. 
  Clinton, like Yasushi Akashi, [UN Secretary General] Butrus- 
Ghali's representative, was counting on the presumed moderating 
influence of the Russians to persuade the Serbs not to take an 
irrevocable step in Gorazde. Assurances of this came from 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev who was in Belgrade on 
Saturday and Sunday morning, and from Vitaliy Churkin, the 
Russian negotiator, who was in Pale at the same time. But, as 
early as Sunday, these assurances seemed groundless. Is this 
incompetence or bad faith? Despite the accusations made on 
Monday by Vitaliy Churkin against "Serbian extremists in 
Bosnia," we do not yet know for sure whether the two Russian 
diplomats were simply objective accomplices of the Serbs or 
whether they deliberately put up a smokescreen to conceal the 
Serbs' double-dealing. In either case, their credibility has 
been largely undermined. 
  "We have returned to the situation which prevailed in Bosnia 
at Christmas, but it is worse because we no longer have the 
threat of air strikes up our sleeve," a French official 
commented on Monday evening. "No abandonment or escalation," 
[French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe said for his part. That 
therefore leaves the diplomatic path, which is no longer 
bilateral but multilateral, grouping Americans, Russians, and 
Europeans in a first phase, and Croatians, Muslims, and Serbs in 
a second phase. But these are Serbs intoxicated by their 
victory and, in particular, by the destruction of a British 
plane.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "The Fait Accompli"] </F>
  [Text] Francois Mitterrand, who is running short of 
excuses on Bosnia, has now resorted to the fig leaf. By 
proposing to his allies yesterday to set up a kind of grand 
conference to end the war, the president of the Republic is no 
longer even trying to find a diplomatic explanation for the 
Western countries' passiveness. It is simply a question of 
distracting the public's attention while General Mladic deals 
the death blow to Gorazde. 
  The Serbs will certainly not allow themselves to be 
intimidated. Gorazde is merely the latest of the "safe areas" 
theoretically placed under UN protection which has had to suffer 
a military onslaught. For several months, they have totally 
destroyed the credibility of the United Nations, whose 
resolutions have been just so many pieces of paper. But, from 
their viewpoint, the Serbs have just done even better. Taking 
up a challenge which the former USSR had always avoided, for 
obviously much higher stakes, they have demonstrated that NATO 
was brandishing a stick and not a sword. 
  The two raids by the U.S. Air Force on Gorazde last week in 
fact conveyed a very ambiguous message. By making do with 
destroying a few vehicles instead of carrying out a large-scale 
strike, the F-16 planes clearly indicated that the allies 
preferred negotiation to war. The same signal of weakness was 
given by the French Naval Air Force in 1983 when, after three 
weeks of consideration, it avenged the 58 who died in the 
Drakkar outrage by bombing empty barracks. 
  Bill Clinton's embarrassed statements yesterday confirmed 
the 
failed action in Gorazde. For the U.S. President, the aim is 
"to prevent the conflict from spreading." The leader of the 
world's only superpower is merely finding reasons for doing 
nothing. 
  It is true that it is very late. The Atlantic alliance could 
perhaps have halted the Serbs if it had intervened immediately 
after the start of hostilities against Slovenia and Croatia in 
June 1991. NATO's planes would not have found it difficult to 
silence the artillery which, in November 1991, pounded Vukovar, 
and it would have been even simpler, a few days later, to sink 
the gunboats which were bombarding Dubrovnik, that jewel classed 
as part of mankind's heritage by UNESCO. 
  But why did the Europeans try to restore order in Somalia or 
restore peace in Cambodia, if they are too timid to try to put 
out the fires on their own continent? And why are the Americans 
so anxious to preserve NATO if the soldiers of this alliance 
have no other function than to march on parade days? Finally, 
why worry about the rapid return of the Russians to the 
diplomatic and military game when they are content to be in a 
vacuum? 
  The fait accompli which is now being accepted in the Balkans 
is likely to topple other dominoes soon. By bowing to the 
Serbs' takeover by force, the Europeans are exposing themselves 
to a return to the law of the jungle in the near future.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Toubon] </F>
  [Text] It is one thing to observe the international 
community's impotence in the former Yugoslavia. Accepting it 
without seeking the causes of this impotence, in other words, 
the means of overcoming it, is a different matter. The causes, 
or rather, the cause is the persistent refusal to take account 
of the real situation. 
  Thinking that, after the fall of communism, the East 
European 
theater would automatically be destined for peace and fraternity 
was a refusal to accept reality. Believing that Serbia would 
allow the other Yugoslav republics to declare their independence 
without reacting was also a refusal to accept reality. Finally, 
believing that the United Nations could solve the problem was 
also a refusal to accept reality, taking into account that its 
troops were locked into a humanitarian mission and limited to 
self-defense, and that they were in any case technically unable 
to intervene effectively because of the problems of the terrain 
and the extreme proximity of the different armed groups and 
their interweaving with civilians. 
  For the future, taking account of the real situation would 
obviously mean taking note of the fact that the Serbs have 
already achieved virtually what they wanted on the ground. 
Belgrade is primarily now seeking the same thing as the 
international community: an honorable way out. And the only 
point on which this way out could be organized is the embargo. 
Although Serbia's isolation is not preventing the continuation 
of the war, it does jeopardize the viability of the new Yugoslav 
Federation and hence the power of Milosevic and his friends. As 
for the international community, in addition to the fact that 
this is the only argument it has in exchange for a definitive 
halt in the fighting, it cannot go on forever practicing 
selective humanitarian indignation, because, after all, in 
Belgrade and in Sarajevo, it is always the same people who 
suffer, the vast majority of "ordinary people," and not the 
thugs or fanatics of pan-Serbism or expansionist Islamic 
fundamentalism. Moreover, it is no accident that we have just 
learned that the United States is now prepared to discuss a 
gradual lifting of the embargo in exchange for an end to the 
Serbian military operations and Belgrade's return to the 
negotiating table. Of course, when the same proposal was made a 
few months ago by [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe and his German 
counterpart, it was met with widespread indifference. However, 
admitting that, rightly or wrongly, what happens in Washington 
and Moscow will always have more weight than what might be said 
in Paris and Bonn is also accepting the harsh law of reality.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F>
Miglio by Mario Avagliano in Como; date not given: "Miglio: 
The Italian Popular Party Must Decide" -- first paragraph is 
L'INFORMAZIONE introduction] 
  [Text] And now Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's seat]? "Of 
course." Will [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi get the job? 
"It is extremely likely. There are no problems as far as we 
are concerned." Senator Gianfranco Miglio, the ideologue of the 
Northern League, comfortably relaxed in a velvet armchair in his 
beautiful house in Como, answers the questions in a friendly 
way. He returned to Lombardy yesterday morning, after the long 
marathon of electing the Chamber of Deputies speaker. 
  [Avagliano] Were you excited to see a member of the Northern 
League elected speaker? 
  [Miglio] No. I have studied politics for 50 years. I have 
become so absorbed in it that I can participate without ever 
getting excited. 
  [Avagliano] You were not even excited over the confrontation 
between [outgoing Senate speaker] Spadolini and [newly-elected 
Forza Italia Senate speaker] Scognamiglio? 
  [Miglio] I enjoyed the Senate votevery much. It was 
thrilling. Probably not for Spadolini. 
  [Avagliano] What do you think of the new speaker 
Scognamiglio? 
  [Miglio] He is a well-balanced person. He has experience in 
the field of economics and could be a very tactful speaker at 
the Senate. Above all, it has been revealed that Spadolini is 
not the only person in Italy who could possibly be Senate 
speaker. It was a legend. In a democracy a high turnover rate 
is the basis of good health. 
  [Avagliano] What about the new lower house speaker, Irene 
Pivetti? 
  [Miglio] She has a strong character. She will play her part 
well, having an elevated ethical conception of her role. 
[Northern League Secretary] Bossi made a good choice. He is 
always the one who chooses, with absolute authority And then it 
is a nice way to patch up the old hostilities between the church 
and the League. 
  [Avagliano] Both the new speakers come from Lombardy. Are 
you getting ready to "storm" the institutions, given that 
Berlusconi is also from Milan? 
  [Miglio] Since the League started, it has been evident that 
there would be a lot of people from the North. Forza Italia is 
also basically a northern movement. 
  [Avagliano] Do you think that this is positive? 
  [Miglio] Of course. The strong protest against the First 
Republic, which was Roman, came from the North. It is natural 
for Roman centralism to be swept away by a wave coming from the 
North. 
  [Avagliano] Berlusconi has opened up to the center. Do you 
agree with him? 
  [Miglio] Some of the former Christian democrats at the 
center 
have ideas that are similar enough to those of Forza Italia and 
the League. However, the current political situation is 
anomalous. Christian Democrats embracing Social Communists. 
  [Avagliano] Why anomalous? 
  [Miglio] It is a mortal embrace for the PPI [Italian Popular 
Party] members. And since there are two poles, they will soon 
gravitate into the pole that welcomes them best. We need their 
votes to make up a solid majority in the Senate. 
  [Avagliano] Should [President] Scalfaro resign when the 
government has been formed? 
  [Miglio] The moment will soon come. The SISDE [Intelligence 
and Democratic Security Service] judicial proceedings should 
reach a turning point before the end of the month and this will 
create a very difficult situation. However, it is important 
that he first gets everything completed before the new 
government starts working.

<F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, by Luciana Di Mauro in Rome; date 
not given: "D'Alema: `Latch on to the Center? Berlusconi Did 
Not Manage To'"] 
  [Text] [D'Alema] The political operation attempted by 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, namely that of latching on to 
the Center, did not succeed. At most, they managed to secure a 
few votes under the table. Our task now is to strive to create 
a broad opposition in parliament, not limited to the forces on 
the Left. In this sense, voting for Spadolini was a positive 
choice. [D'Alema ends] 
  Thus the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] outgoing 
speaker, who now prefers to simply call himself the Gallipoli 
deputy, commented on the two-day session which led to the 
election of the two parliamentary speakers nominated by the 
majority. 
  [Di Mauro] Deputy D'Alema, do you believe that the majority 
obtained for Scognamiglio's nomination may result in a political 
majority being formed in the next few days? 
  [D'Alema] Clearly the election of the Senate speaker, who 
was 
elected by a majority of one, does not solve the problem of 
achieving a political majority in the Senate, although this does 
not detract from the result itself. The majority forces are 
still confronted with the problem of winning the votes that they 
may require each time. However, the basic political question is 
that of an agreement with the Italian Popular Party [PPI]. 
  [Di Mauro] But [outgoing Interior Minister] Mancino clearly 
said "no" to Berlusconi's proposal. 
  [D'Alema] Precisely. It do not think that we are dealing 
with a very likely possibility, but in any case this reveals a 
political orientation or, in any case, an intention. I would 
say that the majority has obtained the result that it was aiming 
at. It was easier in the Chamber of Deputies, and more 
difficult in the Senate. Yesterday morning I heard [National 
Alliance leader] Fini quoting the figures: Obviously he knew 
whom he had contacted. This means that the Second Republic is, 
from its outset, marred by the worst characteristics of the 
first: arrogance and callousness, in short, the worst side of 
Craxism. It is no mere coincidence that Scognamiglio was, 
together with De Michelis, the co-author of a book called 
"Governing Italy in the Year 2000." He collaborated with 
Altissimo [former Liberal Party Secretary]. We are faced with 
the same political-intellectual caste, or at least a closely 
related one, which found its shock troops in the Right. The 
fact that they constitute the same political caste does not mean 
that they are pursuing the same policies. 
  [Di Mauro] Is a tug of war between the majority and the 
opposition now likely? 
  [D'Alema] The problem is not a tug of war. Disagreement is 
only natural in the dialectics between majority and opposition. 
What is serious, however, is the fact of monopolizing the 
guarantee functions. While appointing a man who had "super 
partes" [standing above the contending parties] characteristics, 
the majority could have sought a dialogue with the opposition 
forces. What authority does [Chamber of Deputies speaker] Irene 
Pivetti have to say that parliament must set its hands to 
amending the Constitution? This is not her task. 
  [Di Mauro] In a majority-based parliament, the opposition's 
role will change. In what ways? 
  [D'Alema] A majority-based parliament does not mean that the 
opposition's control role is reduced to zero. Usually, in 
bipolar systems this role is highlighted. In Britain, the 
speaker of the House of Commons is a Labor Party member. Here 
associationism has been mistaken for the need to safeguard the 
"super partes" [standing above the contending parties] role of 
the speakers. A test of strength has been attempted with a view 
to forming a governing majority. The way in which the problem 
was tackled is apparent from the fact that recourse to new 
elections was being proposed should their candidates not be 
elected. A rather disturbing fact. It is right for a majority 
to want to be self- sufficient for the purpose of governing the 
country, but it cannot be self-sufficient for the purpose of 
changing the rules of the game. Having said this, I do not 
think that too much importance should be given to a result which 
stems from the general election results. 
  [Di Mauro] On his first day as a deputy, Berlusconi said: 
Spending so many hours here is giving me an itch. Why is this? 
Is he allergic to procedures? 
  [D'Alema] I do not know what Berlusconi may have said. 
Allergy to democratic rules and procedures, however, is nothing 
new. Craxi went as far as calling parliament a "cattle pen." 
  [Di Mauro] The test of strength over the house speakers 
seems 
to foreshadow a rather more important confrontation over the 
amendment of the Constitution. The majority people are always 
speaking of a minority that will have the right to express its 
opinion but not to cause any disruption, almost as if they never 
need to concern themselves in the future with the control 
exercised by the opposition. 
  [D'Alema] We must defend the rules of the game without, 
however, renouncing the reformist approach which we adopted 
during the election campaign. The question is: what rules of 
the game? It must be taken into account that this is a 
parliament, a constituted body, not a constituent assembly. It 
can make amendments, but it cannot redraft the Constitution. I 
am not convinced by that mixture of uninominalism and 
presidentialism which is being mentioned. The quality of the 
reforms is also part of the problem. However, we must be clear 
that the arrogance and would-be self-sufficiency characterizing 
the majority's attitude must not lead us to adopt a conservative 
line. I repeat: We must develop the reformist approach which 
we advocated in the election campaign, in the course of which we 
did not repropose the "status quo." 
  [Di Mauro] Is there not also an element of novelty in the 
way 
that the new majority is presenting itself? 
  [D'Alema] They emphasize novelty, whereas in fact they are 
continuing the old politics. The novelty lies in their 
arrogance and their claim to be self-sufficient. Continuity 
lies in the lotting process. They have apportioned the first 
positions, and they are preparing to share out everything else 
within a coalition made up of new parties -- but the logic is 
the old one.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Daniele Vimercati in Milan; date not given: "This Antifascism 
Smells of Fascism"] 
  [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] [Vimercati] Bossi, 
are you sure that you want to take part in celebrations that 
will be monopolized by the Left. 
  [Bossi] A decision will be made at the national council 
tonight. I think that the League will be there. 
  [Vimercati] Independently or together with the ANPI 
[National 
Association of Italian Partisans] and other political forces? 
  [Bossi] I only know that Formentini and Pivetti, that is the 
mayor of Milan and the Chamber of Deputies speaker, could be 
present. If they are there it will be the celebration of all 
the Milanese people. 
  [Vimercati] Does it seem worth inconveniencing the public 
authorities for a celebration that brings old divisions back to 
mind? 
  [Bossi] We must come to an agreement on words here. It is 
absurd to divide ourselves on a fascism that has been dead and 
buried for 50 years now. However, another kind of fascism still 
lives on and this is represented by the old regime. A 
clubby-type of regime supported by the DC [Christian Democratic 
Party] and the Left. 
  [Vimercati] Do you want to demonstrate against this kind of 
fascism? 
  [Bossi] Precisely. The partisans fought for liberty but 
these ideals have remained on paper, buried under a centrist 
state that was supported by a diarchy, the DC and the Left. 
  [Vimercati] However, at this moment the Left is relaunching 
antifascism. 
  [Bossi] This paradox must be overturned. On 25 April 
[Liberation Day] the gentlemen of the Left should all be out 
crying because their fascism died at the latest elections. They 
were the ones who resurrected fascism and led it by the hand to 
this point. They were the ones who legitimated [National 
Alliance leader] Fini during the election campaign. And now 
they dare to chatter about antifascism. 
  [Vimercati] Are you not afraid that the 25 April 
demonstrations could unleash tension and generate violence, 
especially if there are counterdemonstrations? 
  [Bossi] I am not afraid of this. We will certainly be on the 
alert. But if a popular force like the League is out there, the 
gentlemen who still resort to old methods like bombs to support 
the old regime will have to retreat. They will not succeed this 
time. 
  [Vimercati] Who, according to you, would have any reason to 
launch an attack at this time? 
  [Bossi] I do not know, I do not believe in this hypothesis 
very much today. It is useless to fly high and to look for 
contorted solutions. I think that the reason behind what is 
happening is very simple and for all to see: The defeated Left 
will not reconcile itself to being defeated and is using 
antifascism as a means of entering the field again. 
  [Vimercati] Perhaps with the aid of the old DC? 
  [Bossi] The DC does not exist any longer, I think that the 
antifascist by name, but fascist in practice, reaction is being 
led by the former communists and their friends. And do you know 
why? 
  [Vimercati] No, why? 
  [Bossi] For the simple reason that the old regime was 
leftist, statist, and totalitarian, even though it contained a 
force like the DC which proclaimed itself a centrist force. In 
reality, it expected to get votes from all sides, even from the 
Right, to take them to the Left. 
  [Vimercati] But what do you mean precisely when you talk 
about fascism? 
  [Bossi] I am thinking of a totalitarian ideology, of the 
frenzied power of a centralist state in which everything becomes 
subordinate to its own interests: the desires of the people, 
liberty, cultural and economic pluralism. In this sense fascism 
became incarnated in the Mussolini regime and then in the 
clubby- type DC and PCI [Italian Communist Party] regime. Two 
sides of the same coin: the first, a dictatorship where cudgels 
were used, has disappeared; the second, a soft dictatorship, is 
still insidiously present. The League has launched its 
successful war of liberation against this. It is an unrelenting 
war against modern fascism, the basis of party dictatorship. 
  [Vimercati] There is a paradox in what you are saying. This 
war has placed you in government with the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement], which has never denied its fascist roots. 
  [Bossi] I repeat, the old fascism is dead and buried. We 
should not be fighting against ghosts, but against real dangers. 
In any case, with the League in the government we will be the 
best guarantee against any totalitarian or fascist temptations. 
We know very well that some forces are trying to recycle the 
waste of the party system. They will never succeed as long as 
we are around. These restorers have the League breathing down 
their backs. 
  [Vimercati] You say that the DC no longer exists. But there 
is the PPI [Italian Popular Party. 
  [Bossi] If this is the case, even Forza Italia picked up 
pieces of the old system. However, at this point the party that 
once existed, the permanent force that occupied the state, will 
not return. The League will prevent the fragments from 
reuniting. 
  [Vimercati] What do you mean? 
  [Bossi] Simple. The PPI will never become part of the 
government as a political force. We will not permit this. We 
succeeded in breaking the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] into two 
and we will not let it reunite. The former DC will remain 
outside. If Berlusconi wants to take somebody on, he can help 
himself. But not all the party: the old DC must not rise 
again. It must not return to the buildings from which we chased 
it away.

<F P=106> [Report by Mino Fuccillo: "And Now the Left Puts Itself in </F>
the Dock"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] After a dazed fortnight on the 
sidelines, it has fallen to [Democratic Party of the Left 
Secretary] Occhetto to attempt to lob a ball or two into his 
opponents' court. Yesterday, he picked up his racket bravely, 
although it visibly proved heavy in his hand. He joked about a 
recalcitrant microphone: "Nothing works here any more." But he 
failed to warm the atmosphere up. Then he accused [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi of a large number of unacceptable 
"about-faces." The first ball made it over the net: Occhetto 
pointed out that Forza Italia has already forgotten its promises 
of tax reductions. The second was not so lucky: "Berlusconi 
conducted his election campaign on the Right, and now he is 
making a beeline for the Center," said Occhetto. True, but this 
only shows Berlusconi's open-mindedness and rapidity while the 
Left is still at the stage of appeals to form a single 
parliamentary progressive group. Third ball: "Berlusconi is 
changing his mind on the electoral law; now he wants a straight 
single-vote system just to knock all the others out; he is 
turning against the two-tier system merely because it suits 
him," said Occhetto. True, but this is the very problem facing 
the Left: It is Berlusconi who is hitting the balls, it is his 
serve, and the most the Left can do is return it. That was the 
way it went during the election campaign, and so it continues 
now. 
  "I have been watching television for two weeks," said the 
secretary of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], "And I have 
seen the shambles: Bossi's outbursts, Berlusconi's about-faces, 
and above all a spirit of inurement, the cessation of all 
criticism, as if this were political normality. I have watched 
Berlusconi say that the dream he sold the voters will be 
difficult to translate into reality, I have watched him tell us 
not to get excited because it is unlikely to come true. I have 
seen the telecracy, and I have seen that no one is rebelling." 
Thus Occhetto reacts to the long winter that is freezing the 
Left, pointing out that the spring experienced by others is a 
mere sham. But they are the same arguments that he used during 
the election campaign, and indeed the conclusion that they lead 
to is a return match to be won by the Left, scheduled for a date 
that does not depend on the Left: "When Italy wakes up from its 
dream, when it becomes aware of the deceit, it will know that we 
did not pull the wool over its eyes." 
  Occhetto is fighting back, angrily and energetically. He 
denounces the "piecemeal, factious attacks on the judiciary, the 
RAI [Italian Radio and Television], and the Bank of Italy." He 
denounces the "proscription lists," he denounces the "lies," he 
denounces the intention to reduce fascism and antifascism to the 
level of simple, symmetrical "matters of opinion." He is 
fighting back as he himself and the Left as a whole have not 
done for a fortnight. But after its defeat, the Left still does 
not know what action to take. It does not know: Might it be 
suicidal to wait for the others to make mistakes? Would it be 
rash to change the names and faces in the party leadership? Is 
going in search of the voters lost at the polls a matter of 
necessity or demagogy? What about founding the democratic 
party? But at the present time this might be the umpteenth 
christening for an unborn party. The Left's long winter has set 
in, and neither attacks on Berlusconi nor the paper balls made 
of faxes bearing exhortations to "demonstrate together" that the 
Left is throwing into its little stove of self-consolation will 
be sufficient to keep it warm.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonello Caporale: "Progressives -- Group of </F>
Five"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- According to the very first (and vague) 
statement by [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] 
Achille Occhetto, it will be a single group and will be called 
the "Progressives and something." It will be the largest 
parliamentary group, both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the 
Senate, despite having lost the Communist Renewal deputies on 
its left and the Socialist deputies on its right. In some 
people's thinking it is intended to be the founding nucleus of 
the future "Democratic Party." The old table has lost two legs 
but now has five: the PDS, Rete, the Greens, the Democratic 
Alliance [AD], and the Social Christians. The group's leader in 
the Chamber of Deputies will be [outgoing lower house Speaker] 
Giorgio Napolitano, and in the Senate -- in all likelihood -- 
[outgoing Italian Republican Party Chairman] Bruno Visentini. 
There will be five deputy leaders in each chamber, one for each 
party. 
  It has been a back-breaking task, but was finally hammered 
out by deputies and senators who, in the first-past-the-post 
constituencies, won considerably more votes under the 
progressive banner than were available to the parties that had 
put them up for election [passage omitted]. 
  There is also a general directing this battle: [PDS Deputy 
Secretary] Massimo D'Alema. He strove for this solution, 
believed in it, and in order to see it come to fruition he 
sacrificed a part of himself for it: While favoring a unitary 
agreement he took two steps back by resigning from his position 
as floor leader -- before anyone could ask him to. He remains a 
general but has lost his stars. He is returning, as he points 
out, to the ranks of ordinary deputy, "the deputy for 
Gallipoli." Pressure from D'Alema, with grass-roots support, 
persuaded Occhetto. Occhetto's new stance persuaded the Greens 
and the AD. The unitary agreement was one that Rete and the 
Social Christians always wanted. [passage omitted].

  [Text] The Italian Popular Party [PPI] has rejected the 
invitation made yesterday by Achille Occhetto [secretary of the 
Party of the Democratic Left -- PDS] to form a common opposition 
front. The news was revealed in a communique by Rosa Russo 
Jervolino. 
  "What makes our opposition different, she explained, is its 
sense of responsibility. It will be orientated toward the 
common good (we are not part of the culture of extremism) and it 
will have the capacity of making serious counterproposals. It 
is for these reasons and because of their substantial ambiguity 
that the invitation to join the PDS has received our courteous 
but firm rejection."

  [Text] Negotiations for the formation of the new government 
are coming to a head. The crux of the negotiations remains the 
need to increase the majority of the Freedom Alliance -- 
something that Silvio Berlusconi is trying to achieve by winning 
over the Italian Popular Party and Mario Segni's Pact for Italy 
in order to gain their support for the future government. Rocco 
Tolfa reports: 
  [Tolfa] To the Center! To the Center! This is the litany of 
Silvio Berlusconi's men, who are desperately trying to put 
together a solid majority so that they can govern. Mario Segni 
has already said no. 
  [Begin Segni recording] There are profound differences 
between ourselves and Silvio Berlusconi. His is a right-wing 
movement that was created with the direct support of the Italian 
Social Movement. It has an institutional and economic program 
that does not convince us in any way whatsoever, and so we 
certainly will not enter into, nor will we support a Berlusconi 
government. [end recording] 
  [Tolfa] However, there is a cautious opening as far as 
institutional reform is concerned. 
  [Begin Segni recording] We are asking for the same changes 
as 
Berlusconi on some points, in other words, voting over two 
rounds rather than one; antitrust laws to be brought in for a 
number of different sectors, above all as far as the mass media 
and private television stations are concerned; and in addition 
we are asking for the reorganization of RAI's shareholder 
syndicate. [end recording] 
  [Tolfa] The door remains closed as far as economic policy is 
concerned; their policies would lead us to ruin, Segni said. 
  On the other hand, Michelini, also from the Pact for Italy, 
has left the door open for Berlusconi. He wants to compare 
plans with Forza Italia. Roberto Formigoni from the Italian 
Popular Party has not ruled out an alliance with Berlusconi. 
  [Begin Formigoni recording] If the positions, the proposals 
of the government were seen to be particularly clear as far as 
what we regard as important for the country is concerned, then 
we could decide on a technical abstention during votes. [end 
recording] 
  [Tolfa] Opposition! Opposition! This is the cry of the 
Italian Popular Party's left wing. In this way, Berlusconi is 
dividing the remnants of what was for so long the white armada 
[against communism, i.e., the Christian Democrats].

<F P=106> [Report signed "G. Luc.": "Dalla Chiesa: `Rete a Loser'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Milan -- The decision was announced last night, 
to general incredulity and stupor, at the movement's meeting in 
Bruzzano, on the northern fringes of Milan. Nando Dalla Chiesa 
is leaving the Rete, the party he founded jointly in January 
1991 with Orlando, Novelli, Galasso and others, and for which he 
was a deputy from April 1992 to 27 March of this year. He 
turned down Novelli's suggestion that he run in the European 
elections. He failed to win reelection in the general election, 
but will remain on the city council while returning to 
university. Dalla Chiesa explained to journalists: "My 
disagreement is political, a radical choice, but there is no 
bitterness." He no longer identifies with the plans of [Rete 
Secretary] Leoluca Orlando and the Rete's national committee to 
break up the movement and without delay move toward building the 
Democratic Party. He objects: "It is a lame project for a 
defeated, one-legged left, a kind of extended Democratic Party 
of the Left [PDS]. On the contrary, the Left should stand on 
two legs: the red flag and the movements for civil society." 
Hence his rejection of the Rete "as a bridge between the 
People's Party and the PDS, and of the policy of remaining mere 
shrubs in the shadow of oak tree [PDS symbol]." Anyone 
contemplating this path "has not learned the lesson of the 
elections." 
  Leoluca Orlando, the Rete's national coordinator, reacted 
uncontroversially: "We will go forward, irrespective of 
obstacles and difficulties, to give real answers to real 
questions, free from attempts at hegemony, and free from the 
constraints of ideology and political machinations." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Milan, April 18 (AFP) -- Italian police arrested 
about 100 people Monday [18 April] in a massive crackdown 
against the Mafia in the Milan region, authorities here 
announced. 
  They said some 1,000 officers were involved in the ongoing 
operation dubbed Scorched Earth and were expected to serve a 
total of 140 arrest warrants in the region. 
  Search warrants have also allowed police to seize hundreds 
of 
weapons, including machine guns and pistols, authorities said. 
  The suspects are allegedly involved in drug trafficking and 
belonging to organized crime.

<F P=106> [Furio Colombo commentary: "America Stands Watching"] </F>
  [Text] America's outlook is a benevolent one and imagines a 
benevolent world. Bloodthirsty conflicts are breaking out 
around the world, but America seems not to see them. This is 
how future historians will describe American foreign policy in 
recent years. On the one hand, fraternal words, perhaps the most 
encouraging words, displaying the most solidarity and the most 
human sentiments since the Kennedy era. And, on the other hand, 
an almost complete absence of action, which renders the world's 
sole major power immobile in the face of transformations that 
are both tragic and radical. Transformations that certainly 
also entail a political cost, which extends beyond the cost in 
terms of bloodshed that is being paid now. 
  The list is a long one. It is enough to cite the collapse of 
Africa, the destructive fury of South Africa, the distant and 
daily massacres in Bosnia, and the nearer, terrible, and 
entirely unobstructed massacres on the hopeless island of Haiti. 
  Anyone wanting to defend the virtual absence of American 
foreign policy could cite the many diplomatic initiatives taken 
by the Clinton Administration in almost all the tragedies 
shaking the world. If it were me, I would not choose that 
approach. This, because it embodies frightening 
inconsistencies, always followed by inaction and silence. 
  The public worldwide has lost count of the warnings, 
threats, 
and ultimatums issued to Serbia. Apart from the brief 
intervention by NATO aircraft around Sarajevo, which suspended 
that city's suffering after two years, there is no trace of 
American thinking on the former Yugoslavia. Or, rather, there 
are occasional, confused traces. They are characterized by good 
intentions, are inconsistent, and immediately come to nothing. 
  The President, who is a man of common sense, is patient and 
does not remain silent. But any explanation (either by him or 
by his secretary of state, his secretary of defense, or his 
national security adviser) does not negate the lack. Clinton is 
an honest man. He says that this time it was impossible and 
that something else will be tried. Often attention is diverted 
away from Washington toward the failures of the United Nations. 
The United Nations now seems like a rickety bureaucracy 
entirely unequal to the enormous task that this "post-Cold War 
period" has set on its shoulders, already overburdened by 
bureaucracy and lacking in political vitality. 
  With regard to the United Nations, we should recall 
instances 
of personal heroism, isolated and stubborn commanders who 
persist in performing a task that nobody supports. The 
exception are the staff of UNICEF who, whatever happens, will 
not abandon the children with whom they manage to deal. But 
this is the strength of certain individuals, not the actual 
political fiber of the organization itself, which is bowed under 
the excessive burden of too many crises, each of them too heavy. 
  But, apart from the organizational and logistical disasters 
that have hindered it, the United Nations is unable to choose a 
policy line, to form an autonomous world view. No more than can 
the drivers of the few ambulances summoned to the site of too 
many tragedies. However, this line of defense cannot apply to 
the United States. The world's major power, we imagine, cannot 
escape the need to occupy a position on the world's troubled 
stage. This position should indicate its degree of involvement, 
its timetable of commitments, its will to intervene, and the 
need to abstain, in accordance with the principles that 
presidents sometimes refer to as a "doctrine." This need is not 
based on an inexorable ideological impetus (which of course 
sometimes colors decisions, as in the case of Roosevelt's pledge 
to intervene against Nazism and fascism). 
  It is based on an awareness of the fact that every tragic 
and 
uncontrolled event in world politics entails a cost. And that 
this cost is bound to increase with the passage of time, the 
increase of the tragedy, and the growth in the number of 
victims. It is a cost that inevitably is laid on the table of 
the American Government. I just mentioned Roosevelt, the great 
leader of world antifascism. It is difficult not to consider (a 
debate in this regard has recently begun in the United States) 
how much more limited, in terms of destruction and lost lives, 
World War II would have been if America, long misled by bad 
advisers, had perceived the danger immediately. 
  However, the real problem is not reluctance to intervene, 
but 
the absence of a policy with its own design, a world view, and a 
scale of responses capable of providing guidance, 
clarifications, and explanations. And also [a policy] capable 
of enabling the other actors on the world stage (for instance, 
the Serbs with their field guns or the Arab governments that pay 
the Hamas murderers working against Rabin and 'Arafat) to 
foresee the danger to which they are exposing themselves. 
  This, in fact, the confused combination of the reluctance to 
intervene and the virtually complete lack of a political vision, 
is the essence of the tragedy entitled, "America's absence from 
the world stage." 
  Doubtless the youthful President Clinton was elected 
because of the dislike for the interventionism of the aging 
George Bush, who grew up in the trenches of the Cold War, in 
which every enemy move had to be countered immediately. 
  People saw the Iron Curtain collapse and tasted victory. 
And, like after every victory, they wanted to return home. 
Unfortunately, that which has been created around this "return 
home," which Clinton has led, is not a reasonable practice of 
limitation and cautions, but a redefinition of the "national 
interest." While at the time of the Iron Curtain this interest 
embraced virtually everything -- from a rising in Malaysia to a 
government crisis in Italy -- now the new definition leaves the 
page blank. Nothing, it has been theorized, must concern 
America unless it affects its people, its territory, and its 
economy. 
  This theory, some will point out, was formulated on the 
Right 
of the American political system. Its preacher in the latest 
presidential campaign was Pat Buchanan, the Republican candidate 
that challenged George Bush. That theory, though defeated in 
the elections, has silently invaded American culture, occupying 
its center, excluding only a humanitarian Left that continues 
(in vain) to represent the cries of anguish. 
  This is how the great mistake occurred. The reasonable 
tendency to intervene less in world affairs became entangled 
with the questionable but peremptory definition of the "American 
national interest." And it has led not to a policy of prudence 
but to a nonpolicy. 
  The sensitive heart of the system, which is its efficient 
and 
communicative President, gives a voice to those who communicate 
to him the suffering and tragedies of the world. But his hands 
do nothing, his cabinet does not ponder, his people do not act. 
Not even in order to say how they intend to limit their action. 
There is no action. The result is a vast emptiness. In a 
world without trustworthy governments that looks increasingly 
like the engravings of Piranesi, the Milosevices run free and 
the Zhirinovskiys act in the certainty that they can do so with 
impunity. I am not talking about physical threats. I am 
talking about the certainty of not violating any rules, because 
the world's greatest power has set no rules to define what is 
tolerable and what is intolerable. 
  It does not take a great political analyst to see that this 
vacuum not only enlarges the extent of the tragedy and the 
anguish that disturbs the world, but also betrays any definition 
of the American national interest that is not abstract or 
artificial. Sooner or later the cost of what is happening in 
Gorazde and Rwanda, in Haiti, and among the terrorists, the new 
torturers, and the new Nazis of the world will be laid at 
Washington's table. And the cost will be very high. Not to 
mention the dead.

  [Text] In parliament today Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
criticized the leading role of Russia and the United States in 
the international action for solving the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia. According to Javier Solana, Clinton and Yeltsin's 
policy of halting air strikes signaled a go-ahead to the Serbs, 
implying that they could continue their actions in Gorazde. 
Solana also said that the presence of Spanish soldiers in the 
area depends on how the conflict develops. 
  [Correspondent Durban] Spain is willing for its blue helmets 
to remain as long as the Bosnian, Croat, and Serb communities 
are willing to live in harmony. This was stated by Javier 
Solana today in parliament. It is interpreted as meaning that 
Spain is still in favor of a political solution to the Balkan 
conflict. 
  [Solana] "I think that the Spaniards have no reason to feel 
humiliated by what is happening. Our role is being carried out 
with dignity." 
  [Durban] Today the gradual replacement of the Madrid Group 
went on with another 300 blue helmets leaving Seville for Bosnia. 
  [Colonel Pedro Brana of Cordoba Group] "The mission is the 
same as the one that is being carried out right now. What can 
change are the commitments, they change according to the 
specific moment." 
  [Durban] "As was the case before, several women officers are 
responsible for the health and psychological care of the 
contingent." 
  [Lieutenant Iris Ruiz] "I belong to the psychiatric group. I 
have a diploma in psychology, and we are going to provide 
support for the troops and for all the personnel." 
  [Durban] A further 500 blue helmets will travel to Bosnia 
over the next few days to join the Cordoba Group.

  From there, from Croatia, some of them will go to the 
Bosnian 
towns of Dracevo, Mostar, and Medjugorje, and the logistics 
group will go on to the Croatian town of Divulje. 
  This is the fourth and most numerous group of blue helmets

<F P=106> [Luis Ayllon report: "Government Makes New Credit for </F>
Moscow Conditional on Gradual Repayment of Current Debt"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The Spanish Government is prepared to 
grant the Russian Government new credit lines provided that 
Moscow begins to repay the debt of over 60 billion pesetas that 
it owes Spain, according to government sources. The government 
envisages converting into new credits 425 million hitherto 
unpaid dollars, as they are paid, and adding another $200 
million on certain terms. 
  Although the government was initially reluctant to grant 
Russia new credit facilities during President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit to Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has finally 
acceded to the wishes of the Russian authorities, who do not 
wish to return to their country empty-handed and without 
something to show Spain's political support for the current 
leaders. 
  Late on Friday [15 April], ABC has learned, the Spanish 
negotiators reached an agreement with the Russian delegation to 
mobilize over the next four years, through 1997, around $925 
million (around 130 billion pesetas), aimed at boosting economic 
relations between the two countries and Russia's development. 
  The accord will take shape today, when an agreement on 
economic and trading cooperation between the two countries is 
signed, but with a clause stating that all this will be done 
"while safeguarding the two sides' economic interests." 
Translated into everyday language, this means that Spain will 
not begin to put a single peseta more into Russian hands unless 
Russia has previously started to repay its debt, which now 
exceeds 60 billion pesetas. 
  In fact, the government has agreed with Yeltsin to convert 
into a new trade credit the unpaid $425 million, which belonged 
to the line of finance granted by Gonzalez to Gorbachev in 1991 
and inherited by the Russian Federation. So if the Russians 
repay $50 million this year, for instance, Spain will grant a 
credit to that amount. 
  But, in addition, as soon as repayments begin to be made, 
the 
government will start to supply another $100 million ($50 
million short-term and $50 million medium- and long-term 
credits), and if the Russians secure financing on international 
markets for Spanish enterprises' projects in Russia, they could 
obtain up to another $100 million from Spain. 
  It is expected that the remainder, up to the total of $925 
million -- that is $300 million -- will be contributed by 
private enterprises. 
  Gonzalez, who visited Yeltsin for an hour and a half at the 
El Pardo Palace yesterday and who will sign the Treaty of 
Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and Russia with him 
today, wished in this way to give a token of confidence in and 
support for the Russian president at a time when he is 
experiencing a difficult internal situation because of the 
economic crisis and the pressure which Communists and 
ultranationalists are exerting on him. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article including interview with Border Guard chief </F>
Lieutenant General Matti Autio by Sven Wikstrom; place and date 
of interview not given: "Border Guard Increases Electronic 
Surveillance"] 
  [Text] Detectors reveal people illegally walking by and 
their movements can be seen on a display screen. 
  The Border Guard is increasing its electronic surveillance 
on 
our maritime and land borders. The installation of a network of 
radars and cameras covering the entire outer or open sea area in 
the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia is nearly completed. 
  They plan to get the system into operational shape by the 
beginning of the sailing season. 
  Electronic surveillance will be increased with the aid of 
appropriations in southeastern Finland and perhaps elsewhere 
near border-crossing points. The Border Guard has procured tens 
of different kinds of sensors, or detectors, through the 
combined use of which they will try to detect illegal travelers. 
<H5>  Testing To Begin in Imatra District </H5>
  The aim is for the officer on duty at the Border Guard 
station to be able to follow the movements of a traveler 
throughout the entire width of the border zone by linking 
detectors. With his radio the duty officer will be able to 
immediately guide a rapidly moving, motorized border guard to 
the road the traveler is on. 
  The detectors can be adjusted so that the guard is not sent 
out after hares or deer. 
  Testing of the experimental system will begin in the course 
of this spring on both sides of Vuoksi in the Imatra border 
zone. After the tests -- perhaps as soon as this fall -- they 
will begin to extend the new technology to other parts of the 
border, chiefly in southeastern Finland. 
  "We are thinking of using the technology locally in each 
area," Lieutenant Colonel Jorma Kosunen said. He heads the 
surveillance technololgy development projects. 
<H5>  Invisible Fence Made of Detectors </H5>
  The focal point and the biggest user of electronic systems 
is 
the Southeast Finland Border Guard unit, which is responsible 
for the Viipuri coastal channel, the border-crossing points of 
Vaalimaa, Vanikkala, Nuijamaa, and Pelkola near Imatra, as well 
as the Saimaa Canal. 
  The Border Guard was unwilling to even tell us what the 
equipment it has procured looks like on the outside in order to 
preserve its effectiveness. "This much I can say: The equipment 
will not prevent anyone from coming in, but it will help us 
observe people who do," Kosunen said. 
  The barbed-wire fence running along the edge of the border 
from the shores of the Gulf of Finland to the latitude of 
Ilomantsi is not part of the new system. "That was built at the 
time only for cattle." 
  With the exception of the monitoring cameras, the detectors 
are often so small or well-concealed that anyone walking by them 
does not see them or cannot suspect that they are there. Some of 
the sensors react to motion and others to heat or vibration. 
  An invisible fence made of small detectors that react to 
changes in the magnetic field can be built in an area. The 
smallest metal object -- even, say, a watch or the bows of a 
pair of eyeglasses -- can trigger the system. 
  Even now, the Border Guard has, in addition to its fixed 
surveillance networks, different kinds of detectors that can be 
moved quickly from one place to another, as is necessary. Border 
guards can follow the operation of the equipment and the signals 
they transmit from cars or other vehicles, also making use of 
them to check on anyone walking by. 
<H5>  Powerful Cameras Sound Alarm at Sea </H5>
  Surveillance at sea is up to now still being conducted with 
conventional methods only in the Oulu and Rauma Coast Guard 
districts. Starting with last summer, tens of new radar units 
and remote-controlled cameras were installed on the rocky islets 
and islands of the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia. 
These powerful cameras can be programmed to sound the alarm as 
soon as a solid object appears on the screen. 
  The data transmitted by the new equipment are read off 
display screens at Coast Guard district command posts in Kotka, 
Suomenlinna, Hanko, Nauvo, Mariehamn, and Vallgrund on 
Raippaluoto in the Gulf of Bothnia. 
  In addition, duty officers in Coast Guard districts receive 
data from the surveillance networks of the Armed Forces and 
pilots. In the near future pilots and coast guardsmen will tend 
more to sit in common facilities, maritime communications 
centers, and in part use the same equipment. 
  Information gathered by radar units and cameras on islands, 
in surveillance equipment, and on ships, as well as by sensory 
monitoring can be combined with the aid of computers to form a 
picture of the maritime situation. Coast guardsmen can follow 
its development -- ship movements, among other things -- on 
their display terminals regardless of where they are. 
<H5>  Small Boats Seen at Territorial Waters Limit </H5>
  The Coast Guard is able to monitor the open sea as far as 
the 
limit of our territorial waters with the new technology, that 
is, the technology is powerful enough to observe small boats at 
the territorial waters limit. If necessary, the system can be 
extended even farther than that. 
  According to Lt. Col. Kosunen, this coming summer will show 
us whether the hopes set on the equipment are fully realized. 
"We won't get a chance to test the systems before the sailing 
season begins," he said. The weather imposes its own limits on 
the technology. 
  The new equipment will reduce the need for patrolling. 
Patrolling of the outer sea area is left almost solely to Outer 
Patrol ships and monitoring machines. Instead of constant 
patrolling with boats, the number of verification runs will 
increase. An object that has been spotted can be observed from a 
boat or an airplane. 
  According to Kosunen, these electronic devices will cost the 
Border Guard several million markkas, but they will spare 
manpower and quickly pay for themselves. 
<H5>  "Pressures on Borders Constantly Growing" </H5>
  Since extradition treaties are making access to Central 
Europe difficult, Lieutenant General Autio fears that ever more 
newcomers are heading for Finland. 
  The Border Guard was rather radically reorganized nearly 
five 
years ago. Small stations were combined, staff officers were 
transferred to the field, the focus of staff and operations has 
been shifted to the southeastern border and the Gulf of Finland, 
and border guards have assumed responsibility for passport 
inspection at the borders and among passengers at sea. 
  [Wikstrom] Border Guard chief Lt. Gen. Matti Autio, to what 
extent can technology replace people in border surveillance? 
  [Autio] We won't know that until later, but there used to be 
one or two men round the clock at border-crossing points, for 
example. Now there are cameras at these places. With all the 
expenses involved, one man costs from 200,000 to 300,000 
markkas. A camera does not cost a fifth of that, and you can get 
a good radar unit for what it costs to employ a man for a year. 
  [Wikstrom] Will the last of the men be taken out of the 
field 
too? 
  [Autio] We'll never get to that point -- the borders will 
have to be patrolled in the future too, but in different ways 
and with different equipment than before. 
  [Wikstrom] The EU's [European Union] goal is to eliminate 
surveillance of its internal borders. Can this goal be achieved? 
  [Autio] Speaking just as a border guard, I say that nothing 
will come of it if persons and goods are inspected everywhere 
and every day, especially goods. For the EU to realize this 
hope, the essential prerequisite is effective surveillance of 
its external borders. Furthermore, many other things are needed, 
among them a pattern of united action by the various police 
forces. 
  [Wikstrom] The surveillance of Finland's borders has been 
praised as being the best in Europe. Is the border surveillance 
of other countries effective? 
  [Autio] The surveillance of our external borders is in good 
shape, but why does Finland have to stand for the fact that 
others do not do their job in maintaining proper surveillance of 
their external borders? Must we be saddled with the 
responsibility for the grief caused by other countries' 
negligence, especially since no one even really knows how many 
nationals of third countries are already illegally in Europe. 
  [Wikstrom] How many? 
  [Autio] There's talk of a million. They are circulating 
here. 
  [Wikstrom] How many of them in Finland? 
  [Autio] Scarcely anyone can say. 
  [Wikstrom] So we cannot put an end to surveillance of our 
internal borders? 
  [Autio] People have often been investigated in two, three, 
perhaps many countries and it has been established that they are 
not in need of asylum. Nevertheless, this group of perhaps 
millions of people are circulating here illegally. It's 
certainly hard for me to imagine that at least some degree of 
surveillance of our internal borders is not necessary until the 
system is in operation everywhere. 
  [Wikstrom] Have Finland, Norway, and Denmark tightened 
surveillance on the Swedish border because of these people from 
third countries who are circulating there? 
  [Autio] As concerns Norway, I can't say. 
  [Wikstrom] Should internal borders be kept closed in Europe 
because of those who are now there illegally, even though 
external borders are maintained? 
  [Autio] If some people have entered your borders and and 
lived in the country for years, you can hardly throw them out 
very easily. 
  [Wikstrom] What happens to them? 
  [Autio] Maybe a new deal. It sometimes seems that they want 
to divide them up. There are many foreigners in Central Europe 
whom they want to get rid of. 
  [Wikstrom] Is one of the aims of the EU countries of Central 
Europe to obtain, among other things, the hassle-free departure 
to Finland of the millons of illegal residents in these 
countries by opening its internal borders? 
  [Autio] The Germans have said straight out that they cannot 
carry this burden alone. The greatest pressure would scarcely be 
concentrated on Finland. 
  [Wikstrom] Germany has concluded extradition treaties with 
its neighbors for the repatriation of those who have illegally 
entered the country. Is this producing pressures on Finland's 
borders? 
  [Autio] It goes without saying that people will no longer go 
to a country from which they can be extradited. After all, they 
can try to go to, say, Russia or the Baltic countries and from 
there [to Finland] across the Baltic or the Gulf of Finland. 
Russia's problem is that the states of the former Soviet Union 
do not generally require visas for any country whatsoever. It is 
easy to get into Russia and from there on to elsewhere in Europe 
and some of them may head for Finland. We must bear in mind that 
the Chinese too are already on the move. 
  [Wikstrom] Do we have to fear that people coming from the 
CIS 
countries and other third countries are trying to get into 
Finland via the Baltic countries and Russia? 
  [Autio] The pressures are constantly growing. 
  [Wikstrom] Should Finland conclude extradition treaties? 
  [Autio] Yes, with the Baltic countries and Russia. 
  [Wikstrom] How urgent are the treaties? 
  [Autio] We should conclude them right away. It's better to 
act sooner than later. 
  [Wikstrom] Would extradition treaties eliminate all the 
problems? 
  [Autio] We'll never get a watertight system. There's nothing 
dramatic about this, but we'll be in trouble before long if we 
do nothing. Germany, Austria, and the rest of Central Europe 
have launched a policy of extradition. I believe that Central 
Europe will bring illegal arrivals under control with this. In 
Germany at least, their numbers have dropped sharply. A year ago 
over half a million had entered Germany illegally. Now the 
figure has dropped to a fraction of that. The next big question 
is what Greece, Italy, and Spain will do. 
  [Wikstrom] So extradition treaties would be the most 
effective means of surveillance of external borders? 
  [Autio] Yes, it's the most effective of the international 
expedients. 
<H5>  What Do the Men in the Forests Say? </H5>
  [Wikstrom] How has the image of a border guard changed, Lt. 
Gen. Matti Autio? 
  [Autio] The new image of a border guard proves to be that of 
a vigorous young man who is at home in the natural environment, 
goes in for physical fitness, is highly educated, versed in 
languages, and adeptly handles ADP [Automatic Data Processing] 
-- a very international type. 
  [Wikstrom] How do the old hands, the men in the forest, feel 
about the new generation of border guards -- are there A and B 
men at the border stations now? 
  [Autio] I don't know, but I can well imagine that that could 
be the case somewhere. Among them there are certainly older 
border guards as well at border-crossing points. What is of 
importance are personal attributes and a desire for reform. To 
be sure, it is precisely at this time that a change is occurring 
among us, and at a very fortunate moment. We firmly intend to 
take on a somewhat new bunch of recruits this year too. 
  [Wikstrom] Are the border guards getting to be border 
police? 
  [Autio] Throughout history border guards have performed 
these 
kinds of duties in border districts, on both land and sea. The 
emphases have undeniably varied at different times. Once Finland 
became independent, the organization displayed a strong military 
aspect: There was the Muurmanni Legion and the White Sea 
Expedition. When peace came, we assumed duties that were more 
police-like in nature than before. At the same time we 
maintained a military system. The pattern is repeating itself. 
We still have the impression that the Border Guard is and will 
continue to be a militarily organized organization. That makes 
sense. 
  [Wikstrom] Will the Border Guard continue to train recruits? 
  [Autio] That depends on many things, but my rough estimate 
is 
that we will only be training recruits in future at three 
locations: Ivalo, Kainuu, and the remainder at Imatra. 
  [Wikstrom] Would it be terminated at Joensuu? 
  [Autio] These alternatives should be considered, for 
example, 
now. The training of recruits is very important so that we 
maintain contact with the populations of the border districts. 
It is an important part of our training and a good foundation 
for recruits. The specter of our having to reduce the number of 
Border Guard or Coast Guard units does exist.

<F P=106> [Article by Ritva Liisa Snellman: "Over a Million Finns </F>
Driven Into Short-Term Jobs; Researcher: Situation Is Permanent, 
Uniform Wage Society Is Breaking Down"] 
  [Text] Rovaniemi -- According to Asko Suikkanen, assistant 
professor of social policy at the University of Lapland, the 
situation of over a million working-age people in the labor 
market has completely changed in the 1990's. 
  This group has had to adjust to short-term, uncertain jobs. 
Meanwhile, there have been unemployment periods of varying 
length. Income consists sometimes of wages, sometimes of income 
transfers, or sometimes of work performed in gray markets. 
  A diminishing group of people in the export industry or 
firms 
successfully operating in domestic markets enjoy income from 
secure wages. 
  When the Labor Ministry announces that there were 524,300 
jobless at the end of February, it is only slicing a momentary 
random sample from the existing number. In fact, over a million 
Finns applied for work last year at the Employment Office. Of 
that number 768,834 were unemployed at least part of the time. 
  In Suikkanen's opinion, it no longer pays to talk of those 
who are working or those who are not. Instead of two groups, 
four groups that completely differ from one another have arisen: 
the lucky ones, those who live in uncertainty, those who have 
been ousted from the labor market, and the newcomers who are 
waiting for an opportunity. 
  So the labor market has changed, but social security and 
social policy have not. 
  "Our social security system is designed to protect the 
interests of people who have jobs that pay a regular wage during 
periods of illness or of brief unemployment. It simply does not 
take into account the circumstances of other groups." 
  Suikkanen does not think that an upswing will alter the 
situation; on the contrary, it has become a permanent one. 
  He would also revise income transfers to be flexible and 
simple. Since people's situations vary, the same solution does 
not work for everyone. Laying people off should be avoided, and 
those who have been laid off should be put back to work. 
  Suikkanen suggests that one way of doing this would be to 
divide the work the way the Danes, for example, do: Three local 
employees and one unemployed worker share the work equally. 
Wages and per diem allowances are added up and each of them gets 
one-fourth of the total. Each gets every fourth week off. 
  There are already signs in Europe of a willingness to share 
the decreasing number of jobs with several other workers. At the 
Volkswagen Corporation, for example, working hours were 
shortened and wages lowered for three years so that 30,000 jobs 
could be preserved during these years. 
  Suikkanen thinks that the whole uniform wage society will 
begin to break down unless the changes are interfered with 
through social policy measures. The next parliamentary elections 
will indicate whether citizens who have been shunted to the 
sidelines have begun to revolt. People's attitude toward taxes 
has already changed: Business firms and households' delinquent 
taxes have increased. 
  Uncertainty and reduced wage income are affecting everyone's 
life. Starting a family is postponed, renting one's home is 
becoming widespread, and pension accrual is decreasing. 
  New life-styles have now come into being. People do 
volunteer 
work or fill the gap left between wage work and social security 
by doing odd jobs in gray markets. 
  The drop in income is also apparent as households' 
indebtedness: People are not always able to pay bills that are 
part of everyday life on time. 
  "Maybe we won't recognize the fact that the change is 
permanent before the end of the decade. Most of the influential 
research institutes still believe that economic cycles will 
patch things up. Only from 10 to 20 researchers are trying to 
talk of new solutions to the problem."

<F P=106> [Gunnar Magnus report: "Hagen Urges Fight Against Muslims"] </F>
  [Text] Bolkesjo -- A battle against Muslim fundamentalism 
with the New Testament as the ideological foundation is the 
course Carl I. Hagen has plotted for the Progress Party [FrP]. 
  In his speech to the FrP's national conference, Hagen put 
great emphasis on immigration policy. He sees a particular 
danger of conflicts in the wake of Muslim fundamentalism. 
  The FrP chairman also spoke out in favor of reduced support 
for single breadwinners. He made fun of other parties -- with 
the exception of the Labor Party, which received praise. He 
sketched a vision of a harmonious society. He also launched a 
political campaign for the reorganization of the public sector, 
with increased use of private services. 
  The delegates repeatedly rewarded Hagen with applause -- 
particularly when he proposed expelling the leader of the Muslim 
Association in Stavanger who in the past has threatened to kill 
writer Salman Rushdie. "It must be made completely clear that 
Norway must not be a refuge for Islamic fundamentalists," Hagen 
said. Deputy chairman Ellen Wibe and some of her allies failed 
to take part in the roar of enthusiasm. 
  Prior to the party chairman's speech there was a short 
debate 
about whether the national conference should voice a 
recommendation on EU [European Union] membership. 
  By 113 votes to 44 the conference adopted a proposal from 
Hagen that the decision be left to a national executive meeting 
at a later date. Wibe wanted a yes vote at the national 
conference. 
  Carl I. Hagen said that he is glad that immigration, asylum, 
and refugee policy "has again become an important issue for the 
Progress Party." He stressed the prevention of violent social 
conflict. Hagen wants better integration of immigrants and 
tougher restrictions on family reunification. He wants to end 
the possibility of asylum in churches, begin the large-scale 
repatriation of refugees to safe countries, and refuse entry to 
all those who put Islamic law above Norwegian law. 
  As far as single breadwinners are concerned, Hagen wants to 
look at removing transitional benefits, additional child support 
benefits, and other special payments. He said that it must be a 
main ideological principle that everyone should take 
responsibility for the choices they make. "The time has come 
for a much clearer emphasis on individual responsibility," Hagen 
said, pointing both to the theory of liberalism and the New 
Testament that is "chock-full of liberal ideas about freedom." 
  He said the following of the other parties: Christian 
People's Party leader Kjell Magne Bondevik is "the greatest ally 
of organized crime," the Conservative Party is a passive 
bystander in political developments, while the Labor Party 
commands respect. Hagen described party leader Thorbjorn Jagland 
as a capable strategist and tactician and praised aspects of 
Labor Party policy. He also strongly attacked the interests of 
professional groups and the power of organizations in society.

<F P=106> [Agneta Engqvist report: "ABB Buys Leading Electrical </F>
Engineering Company in Vietnam"] 
  [Text] ABB [Asea Brown Boveri] has gained a real head start 
through a strategic investment in Vietnam. The company is 
taking over one of the country's leading electrical engineering 
plants. This will be the first of at least five jointly owned 
companies over the next few years. 
  "This gives us a real thrust," Ulf Rolander, ABB's managing 
director in Vietnam, said. According to ABB, this initiates a 
business that will reach an annual figure of 0.8 to 1.5 billion 
Swedish kronor [SKr] in Vietnam by the turn of the century. 
  In practice, this means jobs worth hundreds of millions of 
kronor for ABB companies in, among other places, Finspang, 
Vaesteras, and Ludvika. 
  ABB thus becomes a majority owner of a local Vietnamese 
company already showing a profit today. This will be the first 
jointly owned electrical engineering company in the country.

  ABB takes 65 percent of the new joint venture company and 
the 
transformer company CTBT outside Hanoi takes 35 percent. CTBT 
has a dominating position on the market. 
  The new jointly owned company is called ABB Transformers 
Ltd. 
  The plant is to employ 600 people and produce power 
distribution transformers based on the most recent technology. 
  It aims to become one of the three best of ABB's 30 plants 
in 
the world in this product sector in terms of cost efficiency, 
quality, and technology. 
  "One of the tools, a low-cost piece of equipment, is already 
in place," Rolander explained. The plant will later add, among 
other things, medium-tension switch gears and power transformers 
to its product range. 
<H5>  A Twofold Strategy </H5>
  ABB Vice President Goran Lindahl, in charge of the 
transmission and distribution sector, explained: "Our strategy 
focuses on two fronts: import of projects that attract 
favorable financial support from Sweden and other countries, and 
the creation of products with value added through local 
manufacturing, assembly, and engineering." 
  This shared-risk enterprise sets a precedent, making it 
simpler to obtain funds from the World Bank and the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB), which often insist on local 
manufacturing as a condition. 
<H5>  Development Subsidies </H5>
  ABB also hopes to get subsidies from SIDA [Swedish 
International Development Agency] and BITS [Agency for 
International Technical and Economic Cooperation], basing its 
argument on the fact that much of the project has to do with the 
supply of electricity to the population. The rate of energy 
consumption per capita in Vietnam is one of the lowest in the 
world. 
  The sales volume of ABB's project is expected to reach 
between SKr0.8 and 1.5 billion in five years. Half the turnover 
is expected to come from local manufacturing and the other half 
from imports into Vietnam. 
  This creates immense opportunities for ABB in Sweden, 
Finland, and Norway: Stal in Finspang with gas turbines, 
Vaesteras with signaling systems for railroads, and Ludvika with 
such things as high-tension switch gears.

<F P=106> [Report by Kh. Kharalambidhis] </F>
  [Text] Since Sunday night [17 April], the Republic's 
security authorities have been dealing with a case of spying 
against the National Guard by a British colonel and an American 
first lieutenant. Due to the involvement of foreign military 
personnel serving in Cyprus, this case is considered one of the 
most serious against Cyprus' defense and domestic security that 
has been discovered since the Turkish invasion. 
  According to verified information obtained by I SIMERINI, 
National Guard personnel were on a mission in the area of 
Larnaca airport Sunday night, based on a plan drawn up in 
advance. As soon as the National Guardsmen began their mission 
at 1940 hours, they saw a car approach and stop in the area. 
The car's presence in that area was unjustified and suspicious, 
and for that reason the National Guardsmen informed Larnaca 
police. Before a police patrol car arrived in the area, another 
car approached at precisely 2000 and stopped next to the first 
car. One person left the first car and entered the second car. 
  In about 15 minutes, the police patrol arrived at the point 
where the two suspect cars were stopped, but before the patrol 
car stopped, the two persons who were observing the National 
Guardsmen's moves with night binoculars from the first car sped 
from the area, leaving the second car behind. The abandoned car 
had been rented, whereas the car that left had diplomatic 
plates. The police patrol chased the first car but only for a 
short time. Then, the police patrol returned to the area and 
parked in a concealed place. At 2215, exactly two hours after 
they left, the two suspects returned to the scene of the crime 
[as published] in the car they had escaped in. As soon as they 
approached the abandoned car, they came out of the diplomatic 
car and at that time a police call was heard: "Do not move, put 
up your hands." Both were surprised. The policemen approached 
and began interrogating them. The man driving the diplomatic 
car told police he was a U.S. first lieutenant, a member of the 
U.S. Embassy staff, and had gone there to pick up his friend. 
Police made note of his identity and let him go. 
  The other man was arrested and taken to the Larnaca police 
station, where it was confirmed that he is a colonel serving at 
the British base in Episkopi. The police have not announced 
anything regarding the incident, nor did they allow anything to 
leak out, mainly for political reasons. The focus of the police 
and National Guard investigation is in the following three 
directions: 
  First: Whether the British colonel and the U.S. first 
lieutenant were spying on the National Guard on behalf of their 
embassies. 
  Second: Whether the two foreign officers were acting on 
behalf of Turkey, without the knowledge of their embassies. 
  Third: How did two officers, a Briton and an American, know 
that at that specific time and place officers and men of the 
National Guard would be on a planned mission?

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Yennaris] </F>
  [Text] The question that concerns the government is how the 
information about National Guard work at Larnaca Airport was 
leaked so that the United States and Britain became interested 
in it. Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] broke its 
exclusive report of the incident yesterday and the government 
officially confirmed it today. Government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis confirmed that police had interrogated British 
military officers about an incident in which a U.S. national, 
who was using a car with diplomatic license plates, became 
involved. 
  Asked about the excuse of the arrested, Kasoulidhis said: 
  [Begin Kasoulidhis recording] Their version was that it is 
their hobby to watch the planes land and take off. [end 
recording] 
  Kasoulidhis added that the arrested were not in a prohibited 
area and at first glance it does not seem that they have 
committed a crime. The issue is being investigated further. 
  A U.S. source revealed to CyBC that the U.S. national is 
Major Scott David Dorney, the assistant military attache. The 
same source said he was at the airport to meet a colleague. The 
source mentioned that other Americans, including U.S. Embassy 
personnel, were also at the airport to welcome U.S. Ambassador 
Richard Boucher, who was returning from abroad. 
  An official spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia told 
CyBC that no American has been arrested, detained, officially 
interrogated, or been in a prohibited area at Larnaca Airport. 
Answering our question on the purpose of the major's presence at 
the airport, the spokesman said he was there for personal 
reasons. Of course he did not reveal them. 
  A British bases spokesman confirmed that a British officer 
was interrogated by police and was later released. The 
spokesman added: The British officer cooperated with police, but 
we do not understand what the issue is. 
  Asked about the incident this morning, President Glavkos 
Kliridhis said: 
  [Begin recording] [Kliridhis] I do not believe we can say 
that this is an espionage case, because it is well-known that we 
are bringing in arms. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What did they want, then? 
  [Kliridhis] I do not know. We will find this out when we 
investigate the case. [end recording]

  [Text] Nicosia, Apr 19 (CNA)--U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has said "there is currently a window of opportunity" that 
should not be allowed to close without an agreement being 
reached on the U.N.-proposed confidence building measures 
(CBM's) aimed at bringing the Greek and Turkish Cypriot 
communities closer. 
  He said those measures provided real benefits to both 
communities, not least of which was that they could form the 
base for the two sides to resume discussions on an overall 
Cyprus settlement. 
  This was stressed in President Clinton's report on progress 
towards a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem, to the 
American House of Representatives and the Senate Foreign Affairs 
Committee, released yesterday. 
  The current report covers the remainder of November 1993, 
when the previous report was submitted, through March 1, 1994. 
  Referring to the efforts of his administration towards this 
end, President Clinton said U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator 
Robert Lamb arrived in Cyprus the first day of his appointment, 
underlining the U.S. Government's resolve to achieve progress on 
the island. 
  President Clinton added Lamb had conveyed the message that 
the CBM's were "a balanced, workable package for both 
communities" and that the United States was prepared to work 
with both communities to ensure that their concerns were 
addressed satisfactorily. 
  He also said U.S. Assistant Secretary Stephen Oxman and the 
director of the State Department Office for southern Europe, 
Marshall Adair, met in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller and other Turkish officials to emphasize the importance 
of moving forward on the CBM's package. 
  According to President Clinton, the Turkish side "pointed 
out 
that Turkey had spoken out in support of the secretary general's 
efforts for the CBM's package, and assured Mr. Oxman of Turkey's 
continued cooperation." 
  Clinton referred to the latest developments on the Cyprus 
problem, such as the extension of the mandate of the U.N. 
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for another six months, 
and the release of two studies by UN experts on the CBM's, 
concluding that the implementation of the package would offer 
significant benefits for the two communities. 
  The report reveals that during President Clinton's European 
tour, he met in Brussels on January 9-11 Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou and Mrs. Ciller and told them that "we must 
move forward with a fair and permanent settlement. Both leaders 
assured me of their interest in finding a solution on Cyprus and 
promised to work diligently toward this goal." 
  The report finally refers to the proximity talks opened on 
February by UN Special Negotiator and former Canadian Premier 
Joe Clark on the CBM's and the consultations Lamb had with 
Russian and British officials in Moscow and London respectively. 
  Regarding Lamb's consultations in London and Britain, it 
said 
"these meetings with two representatives of the permanent 
members of the security council once again demonstrated the 
international resolve to find a fair solution to the Cyprus 
problem." 
  Bill Clinton's report concluded pointing out that "there is 
currently a window of opportunity that should not be allowed to 
close without an agreement being reached on the CBM's. 
  ``They provide real benefits to both communities, not least 
of which is that they can form the base from which the two 
parties could resume discussions on an overall settlement.'' 
  Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops 
invaded and occupied 37 percent of its territory.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's report to Congress on the Cyprus 
issue is descriptive and its contents are being studied by the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  Commenting on the U.S. President's position that the 
confidence-building measures represent a window of opportunity, 
Kasoulidhis said that with the acceptance of the 21 March 
document we opened wide a door, not just a window, from which 
the Turkish side is called upon to go through.

  [Text] The United States maintains its hopes that progress 
can be achieved on the confidence-building measures, but doubts 
whether this progress can be achieved by the end of April, as 
stipulated in the latest report from UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and the Security Council's letter to the secretary 
general. This position was expressed by a U.S. official to a 
CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] correspondent in New York. 
  In the meantime, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's 
special coordinator on Cyprus, will meet Saturday [23 April] 
with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, to review the proximity talks on the 
confidence-building measures. The meeting will take place in 
view of Clark's visit to Nicosia next week.

  [Text] Hans Van Den Broek, the European Union [EU] 
Commissioner on Foreign Affairs, and Serge Abou, the EU observer 
at the Cyprus talks, accused the Turkish Cypriot side of making 
it difficult for Abou to carry out his mission properly by 
refusing to meet with him. Van Den Broek and Abou made their 
accusations while briefing the EU Council of Ministers in 
Luxembourg. 
  According to Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] 
correspondent Dhespina Kaloyeropoulou, most ministers agreed 
that the Turkish Cypriot side is causing the most difficulties 
in negotiations for a Cyprus solution. In an interjection, 
Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou stressed that 
the Cyprus issue has lasted for a long time and is causing 
instability in the region. He suggested that the facts 
presented by the observer at the briefing be put on the record. 
  The Greek deputy foreign minister asked that the procedure 
for beginning negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the EU be 
speeded up. According to CyBC's information, some ministers 
objected vehemently at this point, saying that it is not the 
right time to mention a new expansion when the Council of Europe 
has not yet ratified the upcoming EU expansion by another four 
countries and since the Maastricht Treaty will be reconsidered 
in 1996.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis called upon the 
European Union [EU] to set a date for the beginning of accession 
negotiations with Cyprus. He said this decision is necessary 
and may create new dynamics for a Cyprus solution. 
  Addressing the Cyprus-EU Association Council in Luxembourg 
tonight, Mikhailidhis stressed the need for the balanced 
expansion of the Twelve to the south with the accession of 
selected Mediterranean countries such as Cyprus. The foreign 
minister asked the EU to improve trade relations, particularly 
regarding Cypriot agricultural products, by extending the 
exports calendar and increasing the percentages. He also asked 
for broad Cypriot participation in EU programs. Mikhailidhis 
suggested tripartite cooperation programs between Cyprus, EU, 
and the Middle East. 
  Referring to the issue of the EU providing financial support 
for the occupied areas in an effort to balance development 
throughout Cyprus, the foreign minister said this could only 
happen after a Cyprus solution and with the consent of the 
Cyprus Government and through it. He stressed that providing 
financial aid before a solution is an act dangerously close to 
being illegal and supportive of separation, and, therefore, it 
is unacceptable.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Now Is Clinton's Time"] </F>
  [Text] What Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's 
special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, has achieved in his 
meetings with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas is unknown. 
What he has brought is also unknown. However, we could say 
that Lamb's conclusions must reach the U.S. President before he 
meets Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. We could also say 
that the presence of a Turkish Government member in the occupied 
areas is not accidental. The U.S. envoy met Tugay Ulucevik 
before meeting Denktas for the last time before his departure. 
  Many hypotheses can be drawn: that Ankara is trying to look 
like it is putting pressure on Denktas so that Ciller can avoid 
being seriously pressed by Clinton, or that Denktas is trying to 
make up reasonable arguments for the excuses he is finding to 
waste time. 
  As we reported yesterday, the U.S. official's lightning trip 
would have been more significant if it had been accompanied by a 
staggering dilemma: What would happen if Turkey continued to 
disobey the UN Security Council [UNSC]? A letter from U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Turkish Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin, revealed by HURRIYET, indirectly warned 
that the UNSC would adopt measures if the deadlock continued. 
  Lamb's statement that President Clinton remains firmly 
attached to the efforts for a solution is somewhat hopeful. 
But, for it to bear fruit, the chief of the White House must 
exert all his authority and influence on Ciller, who will find 
it difficult to disappoint Clinton if his policy and willingness 
appear to be decisive. It is well-known that Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou's meeting with Clinton will follow 
Ciller's visit. It is also well known that Hellenism has been 
dealt serious blows and has been very bitter about the stance of 
the great powers on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], the intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina with 
the participation of Turkish "peacekeepers," and other 
incidents...all are equally disappointing. The situation in the 
Balkans is heating up and Ankara is trying to penetrate it. 
  On the other hand, Greek foreign policy took a different 
form 
expressed with rage. National dignity will not tolerate any 
more provocations and the Greek political leadership, united, 
stands up to foreign plots and humiliation. The knife has 
reached the bone.... 
  In his upcoming meeting with Clinton, Papandreou is expected 
to raise all of these issues and with firm arguments support 
Hellenism's decision not to tolerate humiliations. It is also 
expected that after his talks with Ciller, the U.S. President 
will have something more tangible, other than his positive but 
theoretical interest, to offer to the Cyprus issue. 
  We have reached boundary levels and any verbal justification 
of Ankara's stance would equal a ridiculing of ourselves and 
others. Decisive handling is necessary when deadlines expire 
with no results because of proved malevolence, not making things 
look good. Now is Clinton's time to turn the page and write 
history with a just solution to the Cyprus issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Shadow of the Bosnian Issue"] </F>
  [Text] The new escalation in the Bosnian conflict, which 
includes NATO's first air attacks against land targets in its 
history, increases the uncertainty in the Balkans and multiplies 
the likelihood of an uncontrolled escalation of the conflict 
that has been developing since June 1991 in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The dramatic escalation of the crisis with the bombing of 
Serbian targets by U.S. aircraft comes at a time when Athens is 
passing through a delicate and difficult phase in the handling 
of big national issues: The Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia] issue is at its most crucial climax since 
our country has been faced with the prospect of international 
recognition of that southern former Yugoslav republic. At the 
same time, we see the greatest tension since the March 1987 
crisis prevailing in Greek-Turkish relations, while the attack 
against the Albanian border post and, rather suspiciously, the 
provocative statement by Sali Berisha highlight the fragile 
character of the relevant tranquility that has prevailed for the 
past few months in Greek-Albanian relations. 
  It is clear that whatever turn they take--an escalation of 
clashes or a return to the negotiating table--the developments 
in Bosnia will intensify the already oppressive pressure on 
Athens that began after the imposition of the trade blockade 
against Skopje. The need for that country's stability will 
become an urgent priority so that the United States and our 
European partners will not be faced with a new area of conflict 
in the south of the former Yugoslavia. 
  That is, the new turn in the Bosnian conflict and the 
further 
U.S. involvement in the Balkans pose a scenario in which our 
national issues might be regarded as annoying pending issues 
that must be cleared up as soon as possible. 
  Of course it is obvious to us that, in the shadow of the 
threat of a more general Balkan crisis, simultaneous pressure 
for a solution to the Skopje issue and for a compromise formula 
that at least "freezes" the tension in Greek-Turkish relations 
would result in a most unfavorable situation for our country. 
  It is obvious that now, almost three years after the 
outbreak 
of the Yugoslav conflict when there is a danger of uncontrolled 
escalation there, our country is unable to make its weight felt 
because its involvement in the Skopjean issue has made it to a 
great extent part of the crisis.

  [Text] Representatives of the Greek and Albanian Public 
Order Ministries will meet very soon in Ioannina to examine the 
recent incident which led to tension in their bilateral 
relations. In a statement today, Government Spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos said that Greece rejects the idea of an international 
or CSCE committee on the issue. The government spokesman noted 
that Albania must prove on a day-to-day basis that it respects 
the rule of law, something which Greece proves every day. 
Venizelos said an example of Greek policy is that our country 
accepts Albanian illegal immigrants, even beyond its limits.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Mehmet </F>
Alkas in the TRT studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Alkas] In our news report we talked about a more 
comprehensive military operation against the Serbs. What do you 
think the chances are for such an operation to be carried out? 
Do you have any information about that? 
  [Cetin] As you might remember, after the bombing of the 
Sarajevo market place at the beginning of February, NATO waited 
for a UN request to act. The request was made on 6 February. 
On 9 February, NATO gave the Serbs an ultimatum and delineated 
a 20 km wide security belt around Sarajevo. It placed the 
weapons in that area under its own control. Had this not been 
done, it threatened to carry out air raids. 
  At the time Turkey argued that since the UN Security Council 
had declared six safe havens on 6 May 1993, NATO must do the 
same in all the six regions, not only in Sarajevo. 
  That did not happen, however. Now, a decision has been 
reached under which the UN secretary general has the right to 
exercise his authority. This is the right decision but it is 
too late. In a letter to the NATO secretary general this 
morning, the UN secretary general asked him to decide to 
destroy, through air raids, the mortar, guns, and tanks in and 
around the five additional regions, that is Gorazde, (?Zepce), 
Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac. This is a significant 
development. It has come too late but it is the right decision. 
  I want to differentiate between two things. NATO cannot 
intervene directly because it is not its area of duty. It can 
only intervene if the UN secretary general asks it to. NATO can 
carry out two kinds of mission there. One is close air support. 
That has been going on very weakly during the past few days. 
The commander in the area has to ask for this support each 
time. The second mission is an air attack. Now, if it starts 
with an air attack, NATO does not have to wait for the request 
of the UN Security Council or for the UN officials in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina each time it carries out this mission. It 
can continue with the air raids until it gets results. 
  Now, the request has been made to NATO. The NATO Council 
will convene in Brussels tomorrow to discuss this request. The 
Council is composed of the ambassadors to NATO. After a 
decision is reached, NATO will tell Butrus-Ghali that it is 
ready to carry out the mission. The minute Butrus-Ghali says go 
ahead, NATO can start to act, and after that, as I said, NATO 
has the initiative. This is an important development, but there 
should not have been so much suffering for this development to 
take place. I hope and wish... [changes thought] NATO has 16 
members. The decision to carry air raids can only be made if it 
is unanimous. Efforts were made today to ensure this unanimity. 
  [Alkas] There is also the Russian issue. Russian President 
Yeltsin has blamed the Serbs for the increased tension. Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev accused the Serbs of trying the limits of the 
world's patience. Russia announced that it will officially end 
its mediator role in the talks with the Serbs. What is 
happening in the Russian front, Mr. Cetin? 
  [Cetin] What the Russian officials are saying is not new. 
Russia thought that this problem could be solved through 
diplomacy, through negotiations. The United States also asked 
Russia to try this path. However, if you look back to the past 
two years, you see that the Serbs only tried to gain time. We 
said both in Brussels and in New York that the Serbs were taking 
part in the negotiations only to gain time, because they needed 
time to achieve their aim in Gorazde. That is indeed what 
happened. And while doing that, the Serbs deceived the 
Russians. They promised that they would leave Gorazde to 
positions 3 km away, and that they would not occupy Gorazde. 
  This is not the first time. We have been living through that 
for the past two years. In this way, the Serbs both gained time 
and prevented the United Nations and NATO from reaching a 
decision earlier. 
  [Alkas] Do you think that a common approach to the problem 
is beginning to take shape between the United States and Russia? 
  [Cetin] We also talked to the Russians about this issue. I 
met with Kozyrev a couple of times. I told him that to solve 
this problem in the Balkans, Russia must contribute, that we 
must act together. It is a fact that especially due to their 
common orthodox religion, Russia and the Serbs have close 
relations, Russia has influence over them. The whole world 
wanted to take advantage of this, especially the United States. 
However, the world later realized that the Belgrade officials, 
the Serbs, understand only one language: a determined threat to 
intervene. Otherwise, the negotiations mean nothing for them. 
The Russians realized this too now. I believe that they can 
now contribute more easily at the UN Security Council, if their 
policy continues along these lines. 
  [Alkas] Thank you.

  [Text] Prosperity Party deputy leader Abdullah Gul has said 
that even if it has to act alone, Turkey must violate the arms 
embargo imposed on the Bosnian Muslims. 
  At a news conference in parliament, Abdullah Gul said that 
the weapons of the former Yugoslavia are now in the hands of 
Serbs and that many countries are openly giving arms to the 
Serbs. The Bosnians are still under an arms embargo, he said, 
and are left defenseless before the Serbs. 
  Gul stressed that Turkey must urgently violate the embargo 
and withdraw the Turkish ship serving with the United Nations in 
the Adriatic Sea. Turkey is the first country that must help 
Bosnia, he said, and within this framework, the defense weapons 
requested by the Bosnians must be sent there without delay.

  [Text] The bodies of another 20 terrorists were found in 
searches in the Shiva region today, within the framework of the 
operations being conducted by the Turkish Armed Forces in 
northern Iraq. This brings to 77 the number of bodies found 
since 12 April, the day the cross-border operation began south 
of Cukurca District in Hakkari. Our correspondent Bahadir Serif 
Onaran reports from the operation region: 
  [Begin Onaran recording] Today, we journalists were taken to 
the Shiva region where the terrorists are trained. The security 
forces intensified their efforts today on the flanks of the 
(Menuni) hill, believed to be the main headquarters of the camp. 
The efforts are being conducted very carefully because the area 
might be mined by the terrorists. 
  In searches in caves, the security forces found one 
automatic 
rifle, 14 Kalashnikov rifles, one machine gun, one 60 mm mortar, 
13 G-3 rifles, eight long-barrel machine guns, 13 rocket 
launchers, nine infantry rifles, a television set, mortar 
shells, hand grenades, explosives, antipersonnel mines, and 10 
tonnes of food. 
  An official told us that because the area is difficult to 
reach the search operation will continue for some time. Today, 
some 20 bodies of terrorists were found. It is reported that to 
prevent demoralization within the organization, the terrorists 
throw the bodies of their friends into deep precipices in Shiva 
region. 
  We observed the high morale of the soldiers taking part in 
the operation. They said that they were proud to be 
participating in the operations in the region. [end recording]

  [Text] Vienna -- "Unnoticed by the world public, Turkey 
deployed 50,000 soldiers at the border with Iraq to be able to 
fight against the Kurds on the other side of the border, too. 
Everything suggests that they will stay there permanently." 
This has been claimed by the European spokesman of the 
Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK), Kani Yilmaz, in an 
interview with DIE PRESSE. Yilmaz is currently in Vienna to 
hold talks with Social Democratic politicians. The ERNK is a 
political umbrella organization of the radical Workers Party of 
Kurdistan (PKK). Yilmaz repeated the offer submitted by PKK 
leader Ocalan to the government in Ankara to end the fighting 
and seek a political solution. "We do not want any more 
bloodshed. We want a public discussion of the rights of the 
Kurds in Turkey." The Turkish Government has not yet replied. 
"It continues to pursue the old policy aimed at ignoring our 
existence." 
  Asked about earlier demands for an independent state, Yilmaz 
stated that the Kurds do not insist on a separatist solution by 
all means. "It would also be possible for us to achieve freedom 
within the existing borders." 
  Referring to the attacks on tourist centers, Yilmaz pointed 
out: "Tourism is a source of foreign exchange for the military. 
We call on the tourist not to support this policy with their 
trips." These attacks are being carried out by individual 
persons, by supporters, Yilmaz claimed.

  [Text] Ankara--At least 24 people were reported "missing" 
in Turkey in March 1994, while 40 others allegedly died under 
police torture or in extrajudicial killings, the Turkish Human 
Rights Association (IHD) claimed in its monthly report. 
  In the report, summarizing Turkey's human rights record in 
March, the IHD said 2,198 people had been detained nationwide in 
the month in question and only 124 of these had been placed 
under arrest. 
  The IHD added that in the same month, writers and publishers 
in Turkey had been sentenced to a total of 12,326 months 
imprisonment and fined TL [Turkish lira] 3.4 trillion. 
Sixty-four journalists are still in prison, it said. 
  The 30-page Turkish report, released by the association over 
the weekend, also put the number of "state forces and guerrillas 
losing their lives in the war" at 500, referring to the ongoing 
clashes between Kurdish separatists and Turkish forces in the 
Southeast. 
  According to the report, civilian and state security courts 
in March demanded prison terms totaling 576 months and fines of 
up to TL 2.5 billion for journalists and writers. 
  Most of the sentences passed and the trials underway were 
related to opinions expressed in writing. The report said a 
total of 34 "mysterious killings" had been reported in March and 
that 102 civilians had been killed. It claimed that 20 
settlements had been forcefully evacuated and/or torched. 
  Speaking on the report, IHD Chairman Akin Birdal said 
violations were increasing every day and that especially in 
March 1994, attacks had intensified on the freedoms of opinion 
and expression.

  [Text] The Ankara chief public prosecutor has concluded 
that the remarks made by Prosperity Party leader Necmettin 
Erbakan at a party meeting last Wednesday [13 April] fall within 
the scope the crime of overtly instigating the people to hatred 
and hostility by discriminating against religion, race, or sect 
-- a crime cited in the Turkish Penal Code. The chief public 
prosecutor handed the file over to the chief prosecutor of the 
Ankara State Security Court. 
  In a statement to Turkish Radio and Television, Ankara Chief 
Public Prosecutor Nazmi Sarvan said that his office completed 
the investigation into the tape of a speech delivered by Erbakan 
at a party meeting on 13 April. We concluded, Sarvan said, that 
Erbakan's remarks constitute instigating people to hatred and 
hostility. 
  Recalling that this crime falls within the jurisdiction of 
the state security courts, Sarvan said that the file has been 
sent over to the chief prosecutor of the Ankara State Security 
Court. 
  Nusret Demirel, chief prosecutor of the Ankara State 
Security 
Court, said that the file has not reached him yet, and that his 
office is also conducting an investigation into the same issue. 
He went on to say that the two files will be joined, and the 
investigation continued.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of President Suleyman </F>
Demirel] 
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has approved the law on 
the establishment and broadcasting procedures of radio and 
television stations. A statement issued by the President's 
Press Center on the subject noted that Demirel first asked 
experts to study the law, which was passed by the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly [TGNA], and then personally studied it himself. 
  The statement stressed that although a long time has passed 
since private radio and television stations began broadcasting 
in Turkey, there were no legal arrangements as in all other 
countries. The statement recalled, however, that the number of 
private broadcasting companies in Turkey has reached 525. Under 
these circumstances, the statement pointed out, it has become 
socially necessary and essential to provide a legal framework 
for private radio and television stations as soon as possible 
and prevent these communications organs, which wield great 
influence, from operating in a vacuum. 
  Pointing out that the president approached the broadcasting 
law based on the view that it meets this basic need, the 
statement remarked that Demirel determined that some of 
provisions included in the final form of the bill are open to 
criticism. According to the statement, in approving the law, 
Demirel took into account the current sensitive circumstances in 
the country. Demirel also noted the national need to take 
special care to protect the country's indivisible integrity and 
the nation's unity and solidarity and not to violate the 
society's traditions, norms, and general morals. 
  Expressing his conviction that the TGNA will quickly 
eliminate the possible dangers and shortcomings to ensue from 
the implementation of the law, the president also said that he 
trusts that the councils to be established within this framework 
and the responsible persons will fulfill their duties with total 
impartiality and maximum goodwill. 
  The statement continued: Our honorable president, who 
sincerely favors a congruence between the needs of the society 
and the output of the media in our country -- which has caught 
up with the era of private radio stations and television 
broadcasting beginning with black-and-white broadcasting in the 
60's and going on to multi channel and colored broadcasting -- 
has approved the new broadcasting law on the basis of these 
beliefs.

<F P=106> [Column by Gungor Mengi: "Let's Go to Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] Europe is experiencing an era similar to medieval 
times, when people were brutally tortured to death for their 
religious beliefs. 
  Due to their helplessness and dependence on foreign 
countries, the Muslims have been merely watching the Serbian 
genocidal spectacle for the past two years. Meanwhile, the 
Christians also have been watching the developments in that 
country in an ignoble and merciless way, because they do not 
wish to have an Islamic country in Europe. 
<H5>  When Will This Tragic Situation End? </H5>
  If the present developments are allowed to continue, the 
tragic situation in Bosnia will end when the tragedy of the 
innocent Bosnian people turns the entire world into a ball of 
fire and forces humanity to pay for the crimes committed against 
that country. Worries in that regard are not unreasonable. 
  Some 65,000 Bosnians live in Gorazde, which is 55 km 
southeast of Sarajevo. The Serbian attack on that city is an 
indication of the serious threat now facing the world. 
  The massacre in Sarajevo in February created a wave of 
indignation even in the Western countries. That prompted the UN 
to authorize NATO to take military action to intervene. NATO's 
ultimatum to the Serbs resulted in a shaky peace in Sarajevo. 
  The situation in Gorazde two days ago answered the question 
of why NATO's deterrent umbrella has not been extended to the 
other cities in Bosnia. 
<H5>  Spit in the Face of the World! </H5>
  NATO's ultimatum failed to conceal the ugly face of the 
injustice that has been done to the Bosnians. While they were 
asked to surrender their arms, the Serbians were told to 
withdraw their heavy weapons 20 km from Sarajevo. The tragic 
reports we received from Gorazde yesterday showed us where the 
Serbs took their arms. 
  The Turkish Government must adopt a clearer approach in UN 
forums. Turkey must not hesitate to openly blame the officials 
and countries responsible for the shameful situation in Bosnia. 
  The Serbs have not suddenly attacked Gorazde; they openly 
advanced on that city and attacked it. The UN declared Gorazde 
a "security zone." That meant an international guarantee for 
that city. 
  The Serbs, who are responsible for acts of genocide, not 
only 
attacked Gorazde and killed innocent people but they also spit 
in the faces of the UN and NATO officials and all those who 
defend or seem to defend human rights and freedoms, including 
President Clinton. 
<H5>  Struggle Against Butrus-Ghali </H5>
  Innocent and oppressed peoples have begun to regard UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who has failed to heed 
Gorazde's call for urgent aid, as a scorpion. As far as world 
peace is concerned, he is an unfortunate factor. 
  Butrus-Ghali may owe the position he holds to his hostility 
to Islamic peoples. Considering that, the Turkish diplomats 
must move to openly launch a struggle to rid the UN of that 
villain. Diplomatic courtesy cannot be considered when innocent 
people are being killed; and a tragic situation gradually 
creates a wave of devastating hatred and drags humanity toward 
the verge of religious schisms. 
  Will the effort by Turkish diplomats move the Western 
countries to take action? No one can say otherwise. For 
example, Germany feels free to expel the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan [PKK] members who demonstrate in that country. 
However, it has not hesitated to impose an arms embargo on 
Turkey, which is indirect support for the armed PKK militants 
who kill innocent people in Turkey. Does Germany wish to 
protect the Kurds? No, that is not the case, because the PKK 
militants are killing people of Kurdish origin in Turkey. The 
German officials are aware of that state of affairs. 
<H5>  Bosnians Do Not Have Time </H5>
  Turkey must address itself to Western public opinion. 
Although the Western capitals have been captivated by outdated 
and separatist trends, the people's conscience is strong against 
the dark ideologies. 
  Turkey's effort may also succeed in awakening the people of 
the oil-producing Arab countries, which have surrendered their 
dignity, resources, and independence to the Western countries 
for petty gains. However, the Bosnian people do not have much 
time. 
  Tens of thousands of people rallied in Taksim Square in 
Istanbul to voice their support for the Bosnian people 
yesterday. No preparation was made for this demonstration. 
Considering that, some 10,000 fighters could be prepared with 
the same spirit and emotional feeling in a week. They could be 
dispatched to Bosnia to help the Bosnians, who have been left to 
die because they are an Islamic community. There must be 
someone in Turkey to organize such a humanitarian mission. 
  Meanwhile, the Turkish Government must move to see to it 
that 
NATO's authority to intervene, an authority limited to Sarajevo, 
is broadened to cover all the other "security zones." 
Furthermore, it must dispatch the Turkish military contingent 
designated for the UN Peacekeeping Force in Bosnia as soon as 
possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Ali Sirmen from the "The World Today" column: </F>
"Why Not?"] 
  [Text] "Turkey will not become Algeria. It cannot." 
  We have been hearing this phrase often lately. Do not doubt 
that those who say this phrase are stating a fact in their 
opinion; but, maybe they are actually expressing a wish. 
  In social life, however, developments cannot be stopped by 
saying "it cannot be, it must not be." 
  Such phrases have been uttered frequently in our country. 
There were times when people said "Turkey cannot become Latin 
America." When the circumstances dictated, however, we began 
experiencing the same things as Latin America. 
  It must be noted immediately, however, that social 
development in one country is never identical to that in another 
country. Every society has its own particular circumstances and 
they differ from one society to another. These differences 
should not prevent us from seeing some of the common factors. 
  It is possible to observe common factors in all countries, 
where radical movements emerge. 
  We will examine these factors in another article, while 
today 
we will look at the common factors between Turkey and Algeria. 
  One of the greatest similarities between Turkey and Algeria 
consists of the high rate in the population growth in both 
countries. This rate is 2.4 percent in Turkey (although the 
rate is below 2 percent in certain western regions, it is around 
4 percent in the southeast) and stands at 3.2 percent in Algeria. 
  This rate of increase in the population, which exceeds the 
rate of economic development, causes big social problems in 
societies where the increase in production cannot keep up with 
the population growth. 
  Especially because of high migration rates, a significant 
portion of the population is concentrated in urban areas, 
creating shantytowns, as in the case of Turkey, and forcing 
people to live in difficult and destitute conditions in Algeria, 
which make the shantytowns in Turkey appear desirable. 
  In both countries, people are given jobs in state economic 
enterprises in a bid to solve the employment problem, and this, 
in turn, pushes the economy into a bigger impasse. 
  Grave economic crises and the inability to increase the 
income from exports make it more difficult to undertake new 
investments in both countries. 
  Both countries are burdened by huge foreign debts, and the 
capital and interest payments obstruct all kinds of economic 
enterprise. 
  Having cited these common factors, let us look at elements, 
which appear to be different at first glance, but are not 
actually so different upon deeper examination. 
  It is said: "Contrary to Algeria, there is a democracy in 
Turkey and the situation will not be the same as Algeria because 
everyone will have the opportunity to express his opinion within 
the framework of democracy." 
  There is a portion of truth in this statement. It is also 
true, however, that this democracy and its parties as well as 
its leaders have become unable to meet the demands of the 
people. The system is unable to overcome its problems and its 
difficulties within its own framework and it is failing to 
provide real or seemingly alternative institutions, other than 
the Prosperity Party. 
  Democracy is a regime of choices. If the choices disappear 
or it seems to the public that there are no choices, then the 
structural existence of democracy loses its meaning. 
  Another argument suggests that Turkey has a secular 
tradition 
of 70 years and secularism is established among the people. 
  Yes, it is true that Turkey has a 70-year-old tradition of 
secularism, which is still supported by the people. It is, 
however, necessary to realize the following point as well. 
Aided by the state's carelessness as well, a new and powerful 
anti secular generation is being raised in Turkey because 
monotheistic education has been abandoned, Koran courses have 
been taken over by anti secular forces, and these forces have 
infiltrated the state's National Education cadres. 
  It is clear that declaring offhand that Turkey cannot become 
Algeria is merely wishful thinking. 
  It is neither right to say "Turkey cannot become Algeria," 
nor is it correct to say "Turkey will definitely become another 
Algeria." 
  When social circumstances dictate, consequences similar -- 
not identical -- to those in Algeria are inevitable.

<F P=106> [Article by Osman Ulagay from the "I Do Not Know" column: </F>
"This Program Would Have Been Promising in 1992"] 
  [Text] The economic package that we had been nervously 
awaiting for days has finally been announced. While watching 
the ceremony described by Mrs. Ciller as "historic" I must admit 
I was upset on a few counts. 
  First, I was upset because the ceremony, to which such great 
importance was attached, was very badly organized. It was 
difficult to discern any press members among the numerous True 
Path Party [TPP] ministers, bureaucrats, and sympathizers who 
kept on applauding Ciller and Karayalcin like soccer fans. 
While nothing was said about the heavy applause, journalists 
were not allowed to ask questions verbally. After the 
conference, the journalists had to squeeze themselves through 
the crowd to be able to get the text of the package. 
  The second reason I was upset was because the package failed 
to give me and many other people any hope, even though it was 
prepared by Ciller and her team with intense efforts and 
probably with goodwill. With her purple scarf and an attitude 
aimed at depicting determination, Mrs. Ciller repeatedly asked 
everyone to "look forward, not back," but it is not easy to 
forget the recent past so quickly. 
  The prime minister would have been more convincing had she 
voiced serious self-criticism and had she made a more 
comprehensive and realistic assessment of the situation. She 
did not do that, and therefore failed to create the impression 
that she will not repeat her past mistakes. 
  If you translate the headings of the measures into English, 
you can say that the program looks like one that might draw the 
attention of say, the IMF. Most of the following measures 
constitute the basic elements of stability programs: 

  -  Real 
reductions in budget expenditures, real increases in revenues, 
and a very significant reduction of the budget deficit. 
  -  The 
suspension of personnel hiring in the public sector, and the 
prevention of real salary increases. 
  -  A legal reorganization that 
will prevent the Central Bank from financing the public 
deficit. 
  -  Adopting an approach that places the burden on the 
various sectors of the community and demanding 
sacrifices. 
  -  Announcing that the necessary steps will be taken to 
close down the public economic enterprises that are incurring 
losses. 
  Yes, all these are very important for stabilizing an 
economy, 
but unfortunately they were announced with a delay of at least 
two and one-half years. 
  Had Mr. Demirel given instructions for a similar program to 
be drawn up two years ago and let his then state minister 
responsible for economic affairs, Mrs. Ciller, announce it to 
the public, it would have been much more convincing. The 
TPP-Social Democratic Populist Party coalition was not weakened 
in the spring of 1992, and if it had announced such a program 
then, the package would have been much more convincing and 
promising both at home and abroad. 
  Today, this is not possible any more. Mrs. Ciller and the 
coalition she is trying to keep alive are not viewed with much 
confidence by anyone. Their performance of the past two and 
half years is casting a shadow on any hope for the future. 
  Under these conditions, it is unfortunately very difficult 
for the program to be promising because: -- its targets in 
connection with the budget savings seem too ambitious, -- bills 
regarding the public economic enterprises and the taxes will 
have to be passed by the Assembly, -- and close to 100 sentences 
in the written text of the implementation plan are in future 
tense. 
  I hope that I am wrong, that the program will be 
successfully 
implemented even under the present conditions, that it will 
achieve its targets in the first three months, and that the 
Turkish economy will begin a stabilization process. I hope that 
I can be happy, and not upset, about the package.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU: </F>
Antidumping -- Definitive Duties on Imports of Silicon Carbide 
From China, Poland and Ukraine -- Also (Possibly) Exports by 
Russian Independent Producers"] 
  [Text] Brussels, Brussels, 14 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The 
[EC] Community Council has introduced definitive antidumping 
duties on imports of silicon carbide from China, Ukraine and (at 
a much lower level) from Poland. A duty has also been fixed for 
silicon carbide from Russia, but, at the same time, the 
Commission has accepted undertakings offered by the official 
Russian exporter, namely V/O Stankoimport (Moscow), and the 
antidumping duty therefore does not apply to this exporter 
which, in practice, is the only one. The duty introduced is 
therefore a "residual" duty of a prudential kind: the rapid 
development of the economic system in Russia could, says the 
Council, entail the appearance of new producers and exporters 
working independently from the State and which would not be 
linked by the Stankoimport commitments. The duty would therefore 
apply to them. To complete the picture, it must be added 
that: 

  -  Procedure concerning Norway was closed as Norwegian 
producers did not have any further recourse to dumping 
practices; 
  -  Procedure was also closed concerning the Republics of 
the former USSR other than Ukraine and Russia as they do not 
export silicon carbide (they had been automatically involved in 
the procedure as, in the beginning, the procedure covered the 
whole of the USSR as a single bloc). Antidumping measures on 
silicon carbide had been adopted by the Community in 1986 and 
should normally have expired in 1991. Nevertheless, the CEFIC 
(European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations) had 
called for reexamination, noting the risk of serious injury, on 
behalf of Community producers Pechiney Electrometallurgie, 
Elektroschmelzwerk, Samatec and Navarro. The product in question 
is largely used in the manufacture of ceramics, plastic 
materials, high quality refractory products, etc., and also -- 
in a specific form -- in foundry and blast furnace operations. 
Community production has been falling since 1990 despite 
increased consumption and the market share of Community 
producers has fallen from 61.1 percent in 1988 to 42.8 percent 
in 1991. China has also taken a considerable market share (1.1 
percent in 1988, 15.3 percent in 1991). The market shares of 
Poland, Russia and Ukraine have increased but to a lesser 
extent. All exporter countries except Norway practised prices 
lower than Community prices: Poland -- 29 percent; Russia and 
Ukraine -- 23 to 49 percent; China 50 to 71 percent. In 
addition, China, Russia and Ukraine did not respect price 
commitments undertaken during the 1986 procedure (commitments 
which were, on the other hand, honoured by Norway and Poland). 
On the basis of the above data, and taking the United States as 
a "reference country," the Commission has evaluated the 
following average dumping margins: China 72.5 percent, Russia 
23.3 percent, Ukraine 23.3 percent, Poland 8.3 percent. Norway 
has not practised dumping. At the same time, the Commission has 
established the fact that dumping practices caused injury to 
Community producers. This injury would increase with expiry of 
1986 measures. Already two production plants (one in France, 
the other in Italy) have had to close down, and this has a 
negative effect on users as competition is reduced. The Council 
shared the Commission conclusions and decided by majority vote 
to introduce the following antidumping duties: China 52.6 
percent, Ukraine 23.3 percent, Poland 8.3 percent, Russia (for 
possible independent exporters) 23.3 percent. The United Kingdom 
voted against the decision. In the meantime, the Commission has 
accepted the undertakings offered by current Russian producers 
to limit the volume of their exports to "a nonprejudicial 
level." The Commission considers that Russian authorities are 
able to guarantee respect of these commitments given that 
exports are carried out through the State trade body 
Stankoimport. It is to be stressed that, within the advisory 
committee (where the Twelve are represented), reservation has 
been expressed by some delegations against acceptance of such 
commitments. The Committee then reported to the Council and the 
Council did not find a sufficient majority to oppose the 
Commission's intentions. The Commission was therefore able to 
approve its decision.

Peoples organized the vigils in front of the embassies of Great 
Britain, Russia, and the United States, as well as other places. 
The Society says that about 400 people joined the

  Tilman Zuelch, chairman of the Society, demanded the calling 
of a special session of the North Atlantic council. He stressed 
that "the ending of the genocide in Bosnia should not be left to 
the United Nations any longer." Without NATO intervention the 
70,000 trapped Bosnians in Gorazde will be "destroyed" by Serb 
troops. In addition, Zuelch demanded a special Bundestag

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Relations With Russia"] </F>
  [Text] The official visit that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin paid to Spain this week has laid the foundations of what 
could be the normalization of relations between the two 
countries. The treaty of friendship and cooperation signed 
Tuesday [12 April] is valid for 10 years and envisages annual 
contacts between the top Spanish leaders [as published], two 
meetings between the foreign ministers, and interparliamentary 
contacts. 
  Relations between Spain and Russia have historically been 
like the River Guadiana: nonexistent, meager, or anomalous -- 
hardly ever normal. The exquisitely diplomatic way in which 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez presented the now signed 
friendship and cooperation treaty is proof of this. For the 
Spanish leader, the treaty is the continuation of another signed 
by Spain and Russia in 1812 -- the year of Napoleon's defeat; a 
formula which, among other things, enabled him to to avoid any 
reference to Mikhail Gorbachev -- the Soviet Union's last 
president -- with whom he signed another document of a similar 
nature. 
  So henceforth relations between the two countries have an 
appropriate framework for ceasing to be "meager," as the Spanish 
side described them, or "anomalous" -- the term used by Yeltsin 
to refer to the past. To the treaty of friendship and 
cooperation there must be added the signing of another five 
agreements aimed at promoting trade between the two countries, 
but this normalization of bilateral relations, although 
important for Spain, also has a Russian and a European 
interpretation. 
  Less than three years after Yeltsin replaced Gorbachev, the 
Russian political situation, and, by extension, that of the 
countries comprising the CIS -- essentially, the geographical 
area of the former Soviet Union -- remains unstable. Yeltsin 
has again received the Spanish leaders' support for his reform 
policy, but the difficult internal situation continues to cast 
dark clouds over the transition to democracy and the 
liberalization of the economy. That is why Yeltsin's constant 
allusions to the Spanish democratic transition should not be 
seen as purely rhetorical. The cases are different, among other 
things because in Russia the change of political system must be 
accompanied by a radical change in the economic system, but the 
path toward Russia's modernization could be similar -- through a 
pact -- as Yeltsin strove to emphasize during his visit. 
  The enterprise of ensuring that Russia's transformation is 
peaceful is an enterprise for all Europeans -- not just the 
Russians -- and the best way to ensure that this is so is 
through cooperation, from which Spain could also benefit in 
normalizing its relations with a giant which, while it is now 
experiencing a grave crisis, has extraordinary potential. Hence 
the treaty of friendship and cooperation signed in Madrid places 
Spain in a good position with respect to the future. On one 
occasion, when asked where Russia was on the map, Hungarian 
President Arpad Goncz stated that Russia is neither Europe nor 
Asia -- simply Russia. This is certainly so, but agreements 
such as those signed in Madrid can enable Russia not to move 
away from Europe.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis announced 
that the Foreign Ministry will make representations to the 
British High Commission and U.S. Embassy regarding the 
observation of National Guard work at Larnaca airport by British 
military personnel and a U.S. citizen. For this reason, he 
added, Foreign Ministry Director General Tasos Panayidhis called 
the deputy British high commissioner and U.S. charge d'affairs 
to the Foreign Ministry. The government spokesman confirmed the 
fact that British military personnel, whose number he did not 
reveal, were interrogated by police for their observation in 
Larnaca airport of an area where projects related to the 
National Guard were under way. In this case, he said, a U.S. 
citizen who earlier had met with one of the British military 
officials also became involved. The area, he said, is not 
prohibited, and initially it was not confirmed that anything 
wrongful had been done. He added that the issue is under 
further examination by the Ministries of Justice and Public 
Order and Foreign Affairs. The government spokesman clarified 
that the British military officials work at the British bases in 
Cyprus and that they traveled in a car with regular license 
plates. The U.S. citizen, though, used a car with diplomatic 
license plates, and he might work at the U.S. Embassy. Replying 
to another question, the government spokesman said that the 
persons interrogated have not been placed on the stop list and 
that they are free to leave whenever they want to. Kasoulidhis 
said that no cameras or binoculars were discovered in their 
possession, as was written in the press. He also said that an 
investigation is also under way to determine how the information 
regarding the National Guard work at Larnaca airport was leaked. 
According to the government spokesman, the version that the 
British and U.S. nationals gave is that it is their habit to 
observe airplanes landing and taking off. Asked whether the 
Republic's authorities accept this version, the government 
spokesman said no. 
  The report on the action of the British and U.S. nationals 
was exclusively reported last night by CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation].

<F P=106> [Nevenka Jovicic report from Athens] </F>
  [Text] [Studio announcer] Goran Percevic, vice president 
of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] and deputy in the Federal 
Assembly, who is heading the SPS delegation currently visiting 
Athens at the invitation of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement], has held talks with Apostolos Kaklamanis, speaker of 
the Greek Parliament. The SPS delegation also held talks with 
Yerasimos Arsenis, defense minister and member of PASOK's 
leadership, and leaders of other Greek parliamentary parties. 
  [Jovicic] The speaker of the Greek Parliament, Apostolos 
Kaklamanis, who today held talks with Goran Percevic, vice 
president of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] and deputy in 
the Federal Assembly, has sent a message to the Serbian people 
to persevere in the struggle for the final realization of their 
just, legitimate aims. Kaklamanis stressed that the Serbian 
people should remain resolute in their just struggle, which is 
also the struggle for the independence and freedom of all Balkan 
states. 
  The SPS delegation is visiting Athens at the invitation of 
the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, PASOK. The delegation has 
attended the PASOK congress over the past few days. 
  In a cordial meeting with the SPS delegation, the speaker of 
the Greek Parliament said that the Greek people understand and 
realize that a big conspiracy has been initiated against the 
Serbian people, and that the aim of this conspiracy was to break 
up the old Yugoslavia. Goran Percevic, vice president of the 
SPS, said that at these very difficult and crucial times for the 
Balkans, traditional, historical, and indissoluble friendship 
between the Greek and Serbian peoples has been confirmed once 
again. Apostolos Kaklamanis accepted the invitation to visit 
Yugoslavia, expressing the hope that this visit would take place 
very soon. 
  The SPS delegation today also held talks with Yerasimos 
Arsenis, defense minister and member of the PASOK leadership. 
During the open discussions that lasted an hour, they discussed 
security in the Balkans and the situation in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Minister Arsenis stressed that the 
denouement of the situation in the Balkans could move in two 
directions. One possibility is to give in to pressure and allow 
the creation of a large number of puppet states that would be in 
constant conflict with one another and would be bossed around by 
big powers. The other possibility is the strengthening of the 
Balkan states, so that they are capable of solving problems 
themselves. The international community should understand that 
the second option is in its own interests, Minister Arsenis 
stressed. 
  During their talks, the SPS delegation, various PASOK 
officials, and leaders of other parties represented in the 
parliament, such as the Political Spring and the Communist Party 
of Greece, expressed strong support for the just struggle of the 
Serbian people and sharply condemned the sanctions of the 
international community on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Replying to journalists' 
questions on the economy, President Suleyman Demirel said that 
the Turkish economy does not have a structural problem, that 
there is investment, production, and exports. Turkey has 
accumulated a certain amount of internal and external debt, he 
said, and the interest on these debts is hurting Turkey's public 
finance. This is not such a strange situation, he said, and the 
state takes the necessary measures. 
  Demirel went on to say: I insist that the basis of the 
monetary problem in Turkey today is the citizens' lack of trust 
in their own money. I call on my people to trust the Turkish 
lira. As long as you run away from your own currency by buying 
U.S. dollars or other currencies, you will continue to 
depreciate your own currency.

<F P=106> [Satellite interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
Paul Amar from Villacoublay airbase -- live] 
  [Text] [Amar] You have just returned from Luxembourg and 
you are speaking live from Villacoublay. Thank you for waiting 
for this link-up to be arranged. You were bitter this morning. 
You called on the international community to regain its self 
control and to define a common position. President Mitterrand 
asked Butrus Butrus-Ghali this evening to restart the 
negotiations. How can we do this, Alain Juppe, according to you? 
  [Juppe] This is exactly what I did today at the Council of 
Ministers of the Twelve. I would like to remind you that we 
were able to define a common position as early as last week on 
the basis of the French proposals. 
  First of all, I would like to say that the question of 
Gorazde, the negotiations in Gorazde, were badly led. They were 
badly led because we did not do what we had done in Sarajevo, 
namely for all those concerned to hold a common position: the 
United Nations, the European Union, the Americans, and the 
Russians. We must draw lessons from this. 
  The first thing we, the Twelve, are hoping for, is that a 
fait accompli is clearly rejected. It is out of the question 
for us to resign ourselves to the situation created by the Serbs 
in Gorazde. This is why we are calling on the Security Council 
to demand an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb troops 
outside an exclusion zone, which remains to be created, and the 
deployment of the UN Protection Force. You know that France has 
agreed to take part in this deployment, together with the 
British and others. 
  [Amar] Mr. Minister, you are being quite firm this evening. 
Does this mean that NATO will intervene if the Bosnian Serbs do 
not listen? 
  [Juppe] This means that each must now face one's 
responsibilities. If this resolution is submitted to the 
Security Council -- and this is our wish -- we will see if the 
Americans and the Russians vote it through. From the moment 
they vote it through, I believe that the message will be clear 
to the Serbs. 
  The second proposal we have made...[pauses] what you said 
earlier in the news bulletin on the evolution of the Russian 
position -- I heard it here in Villacoublay while I was watching 
-- is interesting. Everyone now realizes that the Serbs and all 
the communities at war in Bosnia tend not to take anyone 
seriously, and this may have been the useful part of the 
negotiations that have been under way for a month and a half. 
Therefore, it is necessary for the Americans, the Russians, and 
the Europeans to define a common position, on the map and on the 
development of events, once our basic demands have been met. 
This is what we are calling for. 
  [Amar] In any case, this means that the Russians may not be 
opposed to a firm decision on the part of the United Nations or 
NATO, does it not? 
  [Juppe] This would be in total contradiction with what they 
said yesterday, when Mr. Akashi presented his plan to the Serbs, 
and with what I have just heard in your bulletin, namely the 
words of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin. 
  [Amar] Would a possible UN intervention not be too late, 
given the fact that the Serbs are in Gorazde? A UN spokesman 
has just said that Gorazde has fallen. Is a UN intervention 
possible technically? 
  [Juppe] I think that there should be no mistake about what 
we 
have called for. Gorazde is under Serb control; we should not 
play with words on whether Gorazde has fallen or has not fallen. 
Gorazde is under Serb control. Quite obviously, this deprives 
us of the possibility to carry out air strikes on Gorazde. This 
is why we have called for this resolution by the Security 
Council through a joint initiative from the Americans, the 
Russians, and the Europeans, so that the Serbs -- who are the 
aggressors -- yield. Our aim is also to summon the three 
belligerents to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to 
impose a settlement plan on them. 
  The European Union tried to do this last year. It failed on 
its own. For several weeks now, the Americans have started 
bilateral diplomacy. We can now see its limitations. The same 
goes for the Russians. Once we Europeans, Russians, and 
Americans manage to define a common position, I am hoping that 
pressure on all those war-thirsty people who, it must be said, 
can be found on all sides -- the Serb side today -- could make 
them aware of the fact that the international community is 
determined. This is our last trump card. 
  We cannot yield to the temptation of military escalation 
because we do not know what this may lead to. We cannot yield 
to the temptation of desertion, which would be a fiasco for the 
international community. Therefore, it is necessary to put the 
diplomatic process back onto the rails, together with the two 
diplomatic initiatives taken by the French and approved by the 
Twelve today, and which remain to be approved by the Russians 
and the Americans. This is what will be done over the next few 
hours and over the next few days. 
  [Amar] You used the expression time limit. Do you know what 
kind of time limit you intend to set? 
  [Juppe] The time limit must be very short, because the 
situation on the ground can get out of hand any minute. It 
seems to me that a meeting between us four -- the United States, 
Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations -- can be 
held within the next two days. 
  [Amar] One last question, Mr. Minister. You said earlier on 
that the negotiations in Gorazde were badly led. You want to 
learn from this. Does this mean that the United Nations is in 
fact unable to stop this war? 
  [Juppe] You know, it is necessary to draw lessons from the 
mistakes we have just made, but this does not mean that we 
should expose such and such organization to condemnation. The 
United Nations has its weaknesses, but it must be pointed out 
that its means are not always appropriate. France has been 
doing its duty for months on end. Once again, who is ready to 
send troops to Gorazde? Great Britain and France. Let us give 
the United Nations the necessary means. Let those who have been 
lecturing so far agree to commit themselves on the ground at 
last. It may then be possible to make more valuable criticisms 
of the United Nations if it is not able to make the best of its 
means. At the moment, it does not have such means, and it must 
be given them. 
  [Amar] Thank you, Mr. Juppe, for speaking to us live from 
Villacoublay. Good evening. 
  [Juppe] Good evening.

  [Text] [Excerpt] Earlier today, Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe clarified the government's position on Bosnia. He said 
one can speak of a failure by the United Nations, but this does 
not mean giving up. Philippe Harrouard reports from the Foreign 
Ministry: 
  [Harrouard] A failure by the United Nations, a challenge to 
the international community: As usual, the Serbs are playing a 
double game, but we must neither give up, nor call for 
escalation. Alain Juppe was bitter when he received us this 
morning. The minister added: No withdrawal of UN troops, no 
lifting of the arms embargo, and let's stop shilly-shallying and 
going it alone -- an allusion to the United States and Russia. 
Specifically, the United Nations must vote for a cease-fire and 
a withdrawal of the Serbs from Gorazde. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We cannot accept the violation of 
international law, which is clear in Gorazde, as a result of 
Serb aggression. Therefore, the Security Council must order a 
cease-fire, as we have asked, a withdrawal of Serb forces, an 
exclusion zone, and the deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force]. We believe that such a resolution by the Security 
Council can be voted on forthwith. I cannot see who could 
oppose it today. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
Christophe Leri, Radio France Frequenza Mora correspondent, in 
Corsica on 18 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Let us now listen to Francois Leotard. The French 
defense minister was on a visit to Corsica this Monday [18 
April]. He spoke about the situation in Bosnia, in particular in 
the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which is besieged by the Bosnian 
Serbs. The issue of this Muslim enclave -- which was declared a 
security zone by the United Nations -- has provoked tension 
among the great powers. Francois said to Christophe Leri that 
he rejected the idea of a Serb victory: 
  [Leotard] I do not think we can talk of a Serb victory, in 
any case certainly not of a military victory, when this victory 
means bombing a hospital and chasing away a civilian population 
that is disorientated and distraught because of hunger and war. 
Rather than a military victory, I think that we can talk of a 
moral defeat, which will have significant consequences in Europe 
-- which is based on principles that are totally different from 
those prevailing in Bosnia at the moment: The integrity of 
borders, the respect of the right of nations to 
self-determination, the free circulation of people and goods, 
the rejection of the prevalence of force on right, the freedom 
of people, the dignity of women and children. All these 
principles are now totally ignored in Bosnia, also by the Serb 
forces, and it is only right for the international community to 
question its means, the efficiency of its action, both judicial 
and military, and it is obviously facing a genuine test of 
truth. I hope it will be able to overcome it. 
  [Leri] Mr. Minister of State, what is happening in Gorazde 
today is a failure for democratic Europe, for the United 
Nations, and for NATO, isn't it? 
  [Leotard] I did not use all those words, as you know. We 
have before us something that is a moral defeat, including for 
Serbia and for those who are involved. What has been called 
ethnic cleansing, the rejection of others, the will to destroy 
any others in a geographic and political space, is a moral 
defeat. Europeans would be well advised to recall the principle 
that they have used as a basis since 1945, that is to say the 
opposite of what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the 
moment, partly because of the Serb side. It is up to the 
international community to know whether it is still based on the 
principles that were the basis of the United Nations, and up to 
the Europeans to know whether it is still based on those that 
have been at the very root of the construction of the continent, 
in the West anyway, since the Treaty of Rome. 
  We, the French, have the largest contingent of UN soldiers 
in 
that part of the world, and it is our duty to recall that these 
principles are still alive, that they are still relevant, and 
our diplomacy, now as well as in the past and in the future, is 
striving and will strive to have right prevail, the right of the 
human person and the right of the international community. This 
is difficult, but we will not give up. 
  [Leri] However, there has been a diplomatic hitch recently 
because the cease-fire was broken just after it was signed by 
the Serbs. Isn't that a slap in the face for the United 
Nations, as I was saying earlier, and also for NATO? 
  [Leotard] This is nothing new. There have been at least 20 
or 30 cease-fires since the beginning of the crisis. They were 
later rejected or held up to ridicule. The truth is that 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] officers and forces on the one 
hand and diplomats on the other must resume with extraordinary 
patience, negotiations that must lead to peace through 
negotiations. As we have said on several occasions, there 
cannot be a military victory by one side over the other in that 
part of the world. 
  As for the United Nations, the hypothesis of a war against 
anyone is out. The United Nations is based on acts of law voted 
through by the Security Council, which is based on permanent 
members and other nations. May I remind you that these 
permanent members, including Russia, voted for Resolutions 824 
and 836 unanimously. These resolutions provide for the setting 
up of safe areas. One of these safe areas has just been 
invaded. The civilian population was chased away or is being 
chased away. This is a challenge to international law and to 
the international community. It is up to the latter to question 
its means, its perspectives, and its judicial tools, and to know 
whether it intends to maintain this situation where it is held 
up to ridicule.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrei Badin: "Paris: In the Country of the </F>
`Defender of Human Rights' a Demonstration Is Banned at the Last 
Moment"] 
  [Text] A march of Romanian opposition organizations in 
France (the Pro-Bessarabia and Bukovina Association, the World 
Union of Free Romanians, and the Liberal Club) was scheduled to 
take place in Paris on Wednesday, 13 April, in the afternoon. 
Initially, the authorities approved the march from Trocadero 
Square (known as the Square of Human Rights) to the Romanian 
Embassy, a distance of about one and one-half kilometers. 
However, at 1700, law enforcement officers -- at least seven 
trucks full of policemen -- surrounded the square and halted the 
march on the embassy. Nevertheless, several hundred Romanians 
remained in Trocadero Square, holding banners demanding 
President Iliescu's resignation and comparing him to Ceausescu. 
  The organizations in France wanted to organize a rally on

  [Text] Bayonne, France, April 18 (AFP) -- At least three 
French trawlers were ablaze on Monday [18 April] after being 
attacked by 60 Spanish fishing boats off this south-western 
port, French authorities said. 
  The French air-sea rescue organisation CROSS-A said the 
Spanish crews, from the frontier port of Fontarrabie, came 
alongside the French boats and hurled diesel oil and petrol 
bombs aboard in a dispute over anchovy fishing. 
  The Spanish crews hurled stones and cut across the bows of 
the 12-strong French flotilla, CROSS-A said. 
  It named the three burning boats as the Gael Julienne, the 
Laetitia, and the Mefi. 
  The French patrol boats Mauve and Reseda set sail to try to 
restore order at the scene, but the Mauve became entangled in 
hawsers and nets dropped by the Spanish. 
  CROSS-A said no French ships large enough to intervene were 
in the immediate vicinity. The 60 Spanish vessels were massed 
off Bayonne. 
  The Spanish fishermen say the French have violated bilateral 
agrements endorsed by the European Union under which their 
anchovy fishing campaign should have ended on March 31.

  [Text] At 0300 this morning in Corsica, there were two 
simultaneous explosions 100 km apart. A grenade exploded in 
front of a police station at Pietrodicerce, and a powerful bomb 
went off outside the Solenzara military base near Bastia. This 
is the first time the bombers manage to get within the perimeter 
fence, which is surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers. 
Christophe Lurie reports from Bastia: 
  [Lurie] The bomb was placed within the perimeter of the 
Solenzara military base, an hour's drive from Bastia. The 
explosion, which took place at 0300 this morning, caused 
significant damage to the office of the commander of the air 
base. Colonel Jackie Cognet had already been the target of a 
previous attack. On Friday [15 April] night, a grenade was 
thrown at his home from a vehicle, but did not caused any 
damage. These two attacks could be linked to tomorrow's visit to 
Corsica by Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who will be in 
Ajaccio to present the results achieved over the past year by 
the Balladur Government.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] The total exclusion zone of heavy weapons around 
Sarajevo should be replicated in the other safe areas, the 
British United Nations commander in Bosnia said today. 
  Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose said he had no intention 
of asking the peacekeeping troops to fight a war from 
white-painted vehicles but air power could have a use for 
protecting UN safe areas. 
  "I believe the imposition of the total exclusion zone for 
heavy weapons around Sarajevo is something that could well be 
replicated elsewhere in the safe areas," he said. 
  Asked if he thought the first UN convoy would get into the 
stricken city of Gorazde today in the wake of the new ceasefire 
agreement signed at Pale, he replied: "I hope the words of the 
Bosnian Serb authorities will now be matched by action." 
  Gen Rose added: "We have 141 troops who are going to go in 
there, including medical staff. And we have got humanitarian 
aid convoys as well." 
  Asked whether he wanted more troops, he said: "Of course we 
would have done. We feel that the town is very destroyed. 
There will be many people who will need help and sustenance. 
There is still some sporadic fighting going on. We shall 
certainly need more troops in the future there, but at least we 
have made a start." 
  The accord reached in Pale was important, he said on the BBC 
Radio 4 Today programme. 
  "It does bring about a ceasefire. It allows us to run these 
convoys there. It is described as a first step towards some 
better arrangement. It is a first step insofar as it is 
temporary. It depends upon the willingness of the two parties 
not to resume the conflict. I hope it will turn in due course 
into a cessation of hostilities which is more permanent." 
  Gen. Rose said there were now enormous pressures on the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  "They may have made a tactical gain by capturing most of the 
right bank of the River Drena in Gorazde, but their strategic 
assessment has been nothing short of disastrous." 
  He said Gorazde was at the mercy of the Serbs. "There is 
nothing we can do to sustain the defences of Gorazde. We did 
our best to bring about peace as a peacekeeping force. I am 
delighted to say we have at least a signed document with this 
ceasefire arrangement well supported by the various measures we 
are taking." 
  Questioned about air strikes, Gen. Rose said: "You have got 
to be terribly careful. We are here as a peacekeeping force. I 
have got a responsibility for 15,500 young men and women who are 
here as peacekeepers. I have no intention of asking them to 
fight a war from white-painted vehicles. Their countries did 
not send them for that."

  [Text] Geneva, April 20 (AFP) -- Red Cross staff and 
doctors working for an international medical charity based in 
besieged Gorazde decided Wednesday [20 April] to remain silent 
for 24 hours to protest against the Serb offensive and their 
inability to help victims of the heavy shelling. 
  Paul-Henri Morard, spokesman for the International Committee 
of the Red Cross [ICRC], said two ICRC staff in the war-torn 
town and two doctors for Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF--Doctors 
Without Borders] announced the decision in a statement sent to 
Sarajevo. 
  "They announce their intention to remain silent to protest 
against the tragic events in Gorazde and their inability to 
provide help," he said. 
  The ICRC, whose staff avoid taking sides in the many 
conflicts where they offer humanitarian assistance, said it 
sympathised with the protest. 
  "They are profoundly dismayed.... They are unable to collect 
the wounded and assist the victims on all sides," Morard said. 
  The four foreigners, along with four members of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], have until now provided 
information to the outside world about the Bosnian Serb 
offensive against the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.

  [Text] Vienna, April 21 (AFP) -- Pyongyang officials and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are discussing 
details of a possible new IAEA inspection of suspected nuclear 
sites in North Korea, a spokesman for the Agency said here 
Thursday [21 April]. 
  David Kyd said the inspection could begin before the end of 
the month as the IAEA wants it to be accomplished as soon as 
possible since the UN Security Council wants a report on the 
matter in May. 
  He added that if Pyongyang agrees to the new inspections, 
the 
IAEA investigators would be ready to leave by next week. 
  Pyongyang refused in March to allow an IAEA team from 
gathering crucial samples at a facility in Yongbyon suspected of 
producing weapons-grade plutonium. 
  The IAEA then voted to ask the UN Security Council to take 
up 
the issue of North Korea's obstinate refusal to allow 
inspections of its nuclear sites but stopped short of calling 
for sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  Kyd said that the current negotiations are not focussing on 
the controversial sites involved in the last visit by the 
inspectors.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hans-Friedrich Meyer, spokesman of </F>
the International Atomic Energy Agency, by Wolf Renschke; place 
not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Renschke] Two accidents occurred at Chernobyl at 
the beginning of this week. All through last year there 
reportedly were 36 such accidents. To put it quite simply, what 
prevents the final closing down of this reactor? 
  [Meyer] Certainly the energy situation in Ukraine. In 1991 
the Ukrainian Parliament decided to close down the two reactors 
that are still in operation in Chernobyl by the end of 1993, 
that is, by the end of last year. Because of the bad energy 
situation, the bad situation regarding electricity supply, it 
was then decided not to do that. Since 1991 nothing has been 
done in connection with the reactors, they have not been 
improved, even though this is being done for all other reactors, 
including those in the former East Bloc. These reactors have 
been left as they were and are still in operation. Of course, 
they are in a dismal state. 
  [Renschke] More than one-third of the power in Ukraine 
reportedly comes from this nuclear power plant. On the other 
hand, there is the opinion of the environmental organization 
Greenpeace, for instance, which reportedly has proven in a study 
that Chernobyl can be closed down immediately without hurting 
the country's power supply -- is this an argument that you do 
not want to agree with? 
  [Meyer] First of all, I must correct two things. 
  [Renschke] Please, do. 
  [Meyer] First, it is not one-third of the power that comes 
from Chernobyl, but power from the 14 nuclear power plants that 
are in operation in Ukraine -- only two of which are of the 
Chernobyl type, which is RBMK reactors -- amounted to 32.9 
percent of the power, which is one-third, produced last year. 
  Second, the 8,000 dead because of the Chernobyl disaster did 
not die directly in the disaster but were the so-called 
liquidators, who built the sarcophagus. The number of deaths 
resulting directly from the disaster was 32. 
  [Renschke] Back to the problem of energy supply and safety 
defects. You have mentioned the decision of the Ukrainian 
Parliament. During a recent visit your organization also found 
safety defects. May the decision of a parliament be the last 
word in such a case? 
  [Meyer] Look, the parliament is the representative of the 
people, and internationally the situation is such -- and this is 
the problem of the United Nations everywhere, and we are a 
special organization of the United Nations -- that each people 
is responsible for its own policy. Of course, there are many 
interconnections at the international level, and one cannot see 
Chernobyl purely from the Ukrainian point of view. This is the 
reason why we have invited this delegation to Vienna so that 
they can talk with delegations of 13 other member states and 
with international organizations. The Ukrainian deputy prime 
minister will come, and we will try to have them implement the 
decision of the Ukrainian Parliament of 1991, namely to close 
down these two reactors, which would be best. Otherwise, one 
possibility would be to discuss what can be done if they really 
keep these two reactors in operation. 
  [Renschke] What can you actually achieve at this special 
conference, in view of this situation? 
  [Meyer] Specifically, we can make it clear what our experts 
found. This week we have another team of experts in Chernobyl, 
who are reexamining and analyzing all the accidents that you 
mentioned before to find out why they happened. During our last 
visit in March we clearly found several particularly severe 
defects -- deficient fire protection; above all, deficient 
radiation protection in the facility; a lack of spare parts; 
then, above all, the difficult situation of employment. This 
year alone 13 highly qualified people have left Chernobyl. Last 
year a far higher number of them left. Twenty percent of the 
good staff has left. 
  This situation must be pointed out again -- and this is the 
purpose of this conference today and tomorrow. Some of the 
things can be improved relatively easily. However, as I said 
before, the issue also is to find out whether the facilities 
cannot be closed down once and for all. 
  [Renschke] Incurring the danger that you will correct me 
again, is it justified to deal only with Chernobyl at this 
conference since there are nuclear reactors of this type and in 
this condition not only in Ukraine but also outside? 
  [Meyer] I did not want to correct you again, Mr. Renschke. 
It is certainly good that -- and this is what we are doing -- 
one is dealing with all East European reactors. We have 
programs for all reactors. However, in this case it is 
necessary to act right now because these two reactors in 
Chernobyl that are in operation are in such bad condition. At 
this conference we will concentrate on these two reactors. 
There is no point in acting globally at the moment. We are 
doing that anyway. Here we want to bring about quite specific 
improvements or the closing down of these reactors. 
  [Renschke] Does the West, which has often promised to help, 
actually do enough? 
  [Meyer] This is a difficult question to a representative of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. In one sentence, I 
would say the West could do much more. However, there is the 
question of how much it wants to do. 
  [Renschke] Put in one, two, or even three sentences, Mr. 
Meyer, what will be the result of the special conference? 
  [Meyer] One cannot predict that at the moment. We really 
have to wait until tomorrow noon. As I said before, 30 percent 
of the power is produced by 14 reactors, and, since we are now 
moving toward summer, I assume that there would be a possibility 
to close down these two reactors. However, there is the danger 
that, if the Ukrainians cannot promise that the reactors will be 
closed down permanently, the reactors will be left idle during 
summer, nothing will be done, and then in winter, when power is 
needed urgently -- and last winter they really needed power 
urgently -- the two reactors will be put into operation again 
without having undergone any repair work. This is a far greater 
danger. 
  [Renschke] Do those who are responsible for the matter in 
Ukraine play down the issue? 
  [Meyer] I cannot say that at the moment. We are waiting for 
what they are going to say now, how they will behave at this 
meeting. They come with a very high-ranking delegation. Deputy 
Prime Minister Shmarov will come and so will the deputy energy 
minister. Thus, we hope that they clearly see the situation and 
realize what must be done.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jacques de Larosiere, president of </F>
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, by special 
correspondent Laurent Zecchini in St. Petersburg on 18 April: 
"It Is Not Our Job To Exercise Political Influence"] 
  [Text] In an interview granted to LE MONDE on Monday 18 
April in St. Petersburg, where the annual meeting of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] is being 
held, Jacques de Larosiere emphasized that the EBRD's role is 
not to "exercise political influence in states." He insisted on 
the need to introduce a social security system to reduce the 
consequences of economic restructuring. 
  The image has been telling: As St. Petersburg was Russia's 
"window on Europe" in the days of Peter the Great and Catherine 
II, it was a highly symbolic gesture to select the banks of the 
river Neva as the venue for the annual meeting of the EBRD, 
which aims to facilitate the transition of postcommunist Russia 
and East European states toward the market economy and 
democracy. Admittedly, it was originally Jacques Attali's idea. 
The memory of the former EBRD president is therefore present in 
St. Petersburg, but not to his best advantage: No homage was 
paid to his work, which, despite everything, led to the bank's 
creation and helped it take its first steps. There was only 
thinly veiled criticism in the form of praise for the 
"exemplary" action of his successor, Jacques de Larosiere. 
  To a somewhat irritated IZVESTIYA journalist, who asked her 
in what way things had changed since the arrival of the former 
Bank of France governor, Anne Wibble, the president of the board 
of governors and Swedish finance minister, replied that: "The 
bank's internal way of operating is based more on consensus, 
which is a good way of stimulating people." Mr. de Larosiere 
himself does not go that far. In the interview with LE MONDE, 
he appeared, faithful to his personality, to be a discreet man 
who brings people together and seeks consensus. He does not 
deny that the EBRD has had "an image and credibility problem," 
but he does not want "to dwell on the subject," and would even 
like "to turn the page." 
  This is visibly what everyone wants. Certain EBRD governors, 
such as Lawrence Summers, U.S. under secretary for international 
affairs, were quite clear on this subject: "In the United 
States, consternation has given way to trust and admiration." 
This may be a little exaggerated, but it illustrates a general 
sense of relief. Jacques de Larosiere is not a man to wave 
around great ideas; he is a banker with an impeccable reputation 
and who inspires confidence. No idealistic statements, and 
certainly no "iconoclastic" proposals, are to be expected from 
him, but strict management in line with his mandate. The 
change, according to Poland's governor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, 
"consists in the bank's commitment to budgetary constraint and 
limited publicity." 
  This does not mean that the EBRD will lack a "political 
dimension," but Jacques de Larosiere wants to place it in "a 
more appropriate operating context." If countries fail to make 
sufficient progress on the path toward greater democracy, for 
example, when it comes to introducing multiparty systems, "then 
we will not lend them any more money," he stated. But it is not 
our job to seek to exercise political influence in states. The 
basic idea is that we are an institution which lends money to 
develop the private sector. At the same time, we have to ask 
ourselves whether, in so doing, we are adding something, whether 
we are contributing to this process of transition." This idea 
was picked up in a more trenchant way by Anne Wibble: "The 
primary responsibility for the reforms," she went on to say, 
"lies with the countries themselves." 
  The EBRD president's caution and modesty visibly please his 
interlocutors. These, the bank's president believes, were upset 
by the enormous confusion in its internal organization. "They 
used to ask themselves who did what." Now things are clearer, 
thanks in particular to the geographic reorganization and the 
decentralization which have taken place, and which should permit 
better analysis of local needs. Mr. de Larosiere believes that 
the EBRD's action should be judged "less in terms of amounts 
committed and more in terms of its impact on transition and, in 
particular, on the introduction of a competitive, efficient 
private sector." He thinks it is important to insist on the 
"quality" of the projects, in particular as these are 
"disbursed" fastest. 
  Given the enormous demand for financing, however, the bank 
needs to be more pragmatic, for example with regard to the 
statutory rule requiring 60 percent of financial commitments to 
go to the private sector and 40 percent to the public sector. 
Jacques de Larosiere noted a general wish for "flexibility" in 
this area, quite simply because this rule is impossible to apply 
in certain countries of the former communist bloc where the 
private sector is still in its infancy. Apart from this, the 
EBRD president, along with several governors, is concerned about 
the impact of the reforms which are already under way: In 
Russia and in several Central and East European countries, the 
transition toward a market economy is in a difficult stage, 
which entails a deterioration in citizens' individual situations. 
  The "euphoria" seen in East Europe in 1989 and 1990 was 
misplaced, Anne Wibble emphasized. "Many people believed that 
prosperity was just around the corner. The fact is," she 
emphasized, "that given the totally inefficient production and 
employment structures under the old system, this was not very 
realistic." Hence the need, in Jacques de Larosiere's view, for 
every structural reform to be made in "a stable macroeconomic 
framework with controlled inflation. Hence the importance," he 
added, "of introducing, where necessary, social security 
measures to reduce the human consequences of the unavoidable 
restructuring processes. What is needed," he stated, "is to 
create a self-financed social security system." 
  However, it is illusory to believe that Western countries 
will be able to assume such a financial burden, as the American 
governor emphasized. For an initial period, given the budgetary 
constraints which the former communist countries are facing, it 
might be necessary to find "supplementary financing," Mr de 
Larosiere suggested. Such "targeted social security protection 
measures," he added, "will enable enterprises to operate 
according to the rules of international competition." 
  An idea picked up, in another form, by French Economy 
Minister Edmond Alphandery: "This transition is possible," he 
explained, "only if the reforms are supported by the entire 
population, which will only do so if it sees the first fruits of 
the transition in everyday life. The EBRD should place special 
emphasis on projects which benefit citizens." It is this more 
modest, more traditional, and at the same time more demanding 
role which the EBRD intends to assume under Mr. de Larosiere's 
presidency. In the light of the lessons drawn from two and a 
half years of muddled experience.

Aid No Longer Dependent on Awarding of Orders"] 
  [Text] Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt appealed 
to his EU colleagues yesterday to put an end to the practice of 
"tied" aid. The goods delivered by the aid funds of one member 
state must be able to go to companies in other member states. 
According to him, doing so would benefit the efficiency of 
awards of technical aid. 
  As the major shareholder in the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), we must set a good 
example, said Maystadt at the annual general meeting of the 
bank. The principle of "tied" aid consists of the recipient 
countries being obliged to use the money they receive to make 
orders with companies located in the donor country in question. 
  Maystadt also requested that the bank show its commitment to 
extending mutual trade between the former communist countries. 
In many cases, those countries are not greatly in favor of this 
themselves and opt to gamble everything on making exports to the 
West. 
  Furthermore, he appealed for the bank to ensure that legal 
and ethical standards are complied with, thereby preventing 
mafia-type practices. Intimidation aimed at frightening off 
newcomers and retaining monopolies is widespread practice in the 
former Soviet Union and East Europe. This gives rise to the 
impression that the activities of the private sector are 
equivalent to dishonesty. 
  Finally, Maystadt called for the bank to be active in all 
the 
countries located within its area of activity. It should not, 
he maintained, be judged so much on the basis of its financial 
results as on its contribution to the process of transition to a 
market economy and democracy. For that reason, the bank should 
not hesitate to commit itself in areas and countries where the 
needs were greatest, as long as it did not endanger its 
financial solidity in so doing, said the minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Sagou by </F>
special correspondent Blandine Hennion in St. Petersburg; date 
not given: "Morocco Intends To Profit From East Europe's 
Reconstruction" -- first three paragraphs are LIBERATION 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Moroccan finance minister is one of the 33 
governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development [EBRD], the congress of which ended yesterday. He 
explained to us why his country is interested in East Europe. 
  The third annual meeting of EBRD governors closed last night 
in St. Petersburg with a general feeling of satisfaction. [EBRD 
President] Jacques de Larosiere thanked the 33 governors who had 
"given their wholehearted support" for his strategy. He 
anticipated that 1994 would not be a highly profitable year for 
the bank: "Costs are high because of the new priorities approved 
by the shareholders." He added that major investments would be 
required for the EBRD to be present in each of the 25 countries 
of operation and to finance priority aid to small businesses. 
  Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Sagou came to Russia as an 
EBRD governor. Here are the impressions of one of the bank's 
few southern representatives. 
  [Hennion] Why is Morocco a member of the EBRD? 
  [Sagou] We were asked to take part. Our participation of 0.1 
percent is the same as that of Egypt and the countries of the 
former socialist bloc. Morocco has close ties with Europe and 
does two-thirds of its business with the continent. That is why 
we are interested in European aid to help Eastern countries 
adapt to the market economy. 
  [Hennion] Are you pleased with the way the EBRD's operates? 
  [Sagou] Yes, but we are above all pleased with the business 
potential that the transformation of these countries represents 
for Morocco. This is the first time I visited St. Petersburg: 
They lack a lot here. Morocco has much to offer to Russia, in 
particular agro-food products and textiles. 
  [Hennion] What about the other countries of East Europe? 
  [Sagou] You cannot provide for everyone. 
  [Hennion] You have come from Marrakesh, where the GATT trade 
agreements were ratified. What will profit Morocco most: The 
fact that they were signed in Marrakesh, or the agreements 
themselves? 
  [Sagou] Both. First, this was an historic event that will 
improve other countries' awareness of Morocco. In the longer 
term, the GATT agreements are going to open up markets. That 
will present us with an industrial challenge: Industry has to 
be competitive. That is why it is important to maintain our 
privileged trading relations with the countries of Europe. 
  [Hennion] Morocco is often cited as an example by the IMF. 
What do you think will happen at the interim committee meeting 
to be held in Washington on Friday? 
  [Sagou] Morocco has successfully implemented an adjustment 
policy: Inflation is under control at less than 5 percent, the 
budget deficit is less than 2 percent, and our economic growth 
rate is 4 percent. 
  [Hennion] What about unemployment? 
  [Sagou] That is one of our weak points. It averages around 
16-17 percent. It is precisely to reduce unemployment in 
southern countries that I hope that the Washington meeting will 
decide on a better distribution of financial flows between the 
North and the South. Public aid aimed at restructuring 
economies or modernizing infrastructures should be redirected to 
the South.

  [Text] Luxembourg, April 19 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] agreed here on Tuesday [19 April] to offer South Africa 
greater trade access to the EU as a signal of support after that 
country's first all-race democratic elections next week. 
  The EU's Ministerial Council of Foreign Affairs said in a 
statement: "The Union intends to send a strong political signal 
to the incoming government and to the South African population." 
  The Council agreed in principle to include South Africa in 
its general system of preferences (GSP) comprising low tariffs 
on manufactured imports from developing countries. 
  The decision was the centrepiece of proposals for the rapid 
deepening of economic and political relations with South Africa 
pending the negotiation of a comprehensive new system of 
political, trade and economic links. 
  A formal decision on the GSP issue is expected following the 
EU's 10-year review of its GSP system in May, and consultations 
with other developing countries linked to the EU in the Lome 
trade-and-aid agreement. 
  The EU also agreed in principle to extend its "rules of 
origin" to South Africa, which means that South African 
components of goods partly manufactured in other countries of 
the region would also benefit from low tariffs. 
  And the Council agreed to pursue schemes for promoting and 
protecting foreign investments in South Africa, and to boost 
cooperation in such areas as education, industry, 
telecommunications, science and technology. 
  "We want South Africa to become a motor of economic growth 
in 
southern Africa," an EU spokesman said, adding that the GSP 
break would boost South African exports of manufactured and 
high-tech goods. 
  The EU is South Africa's biggest trading partner, but most 
of 
its imports of South African products currently comprise raw 
materials. 
  Trade between the two sides totalled ECU10.8 billion (12 
billion dollars) over the first nine months of 1993, resulting 
in a trade surplus of ECU2.59 billion (2.95 billion dollars) for 
the EU. 
  The EU has already dismantled all economic sanctions against 
South Africa, and Tuesday's decision is the first element of a 
new era of EU-South African links to replace the frosty 
relations of the apartheid years. 
  The EU Council also proposed to open negotiations for a 
strong interim agreement with the new South African government 
soon after the elections, linking comprehensive cooperation with 
respect for democracy and human rights. 
  And it agreed to use its influence at the United Nations to 
have lifted the last remaining sanctions against South Africa -- 
an embargo on arms sales and military cooperation.

  [Text] The majority of Flemings do not want Belgium to send 
soldiers to Rwanda anymore. Still, our country should not 
abandon Africa, and Rwanda in particular. This was revealed by 
a poll of 499 people in Flanders conducted by Dimarso-Gallup. 
In spite of the deaths of 10 Belgian blue helmets, a small 
majority believes that Belgium should continue to provide 
military personnel for future UN peacekeeping operations. Most 
Flemings agree that our country should accept political refugees 
from Rwanda and maintain its development aid to the former 
mandated territory.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mia Doornaert: "Defiant Serbs"] </F>
  [Text] Shots have been fired in Sarajevo again. The 
shelling was part of the defiant response by Bosnian Serb 
fighters to the NATO action in Gorazde. The Bosnian Serbs have 
since also held UN blue helmets hostage, shelled Tuzla airport, 
which is under UN control, and launched attacks on Gorazde, 
officially designated by the United Nations as a "safe" Muslim 
enclave. 
  Opponents of any form of military support for peace 
diplomacy 
can take the Serbian response as proof that they were right and 
claim that military action leads to more and not less violence. 
  Such reasoning takes little account of two years of war 
misery in Bosnia. For almost two years the European Union [EU], 
the United Nations, the countries which have sent blue helmets 
to Bosnia, have limited themselves to talk and negotiation. The 
EU and UN resolutions were not backed up by any credible threat, 
the blue helmets provided no deterrent. The success of "peace 
diplomacy" has been far from impressive. The single ultimatum 
regarding Sarajevo produced more results than the endless rounds 
of talks in Geneva. 
  A mistake has certainly been made with respect to Gorazde. 
Not by launching air strikes against the Serbian troops who 
were in the process of overrunning this Muslim town, but by 
doing so too late, when the possibility of producing a 
"Sarajevo" effect was lost. 
  The bungling over Gorazde once again shows how necessary it 
is to achieve the right mix of diplomacy and deterrence, in 
order to use the latter in the interest of the former. By 
allowing doubts to exist regarding the commitment of the UN and 
NATO, the peace process has again been thrown out the window. 
  In the meantime, the taking of blue helmets as hostages in 
Bosnia by the Serbs, and their shelling of safe havens, once 
again places a large question mark over UN peace missions in 
areas of conflict. 
  The unclear nature of the mandate under which peacekeeping 
troops are sent into areas where there is no peace to keep, the 
slow UN decisionmaking process, the abiding by rules which have 
nothing to do with the situation in the field -- all these 
elements threaten to seriously undermine the credibility of UN 
operations. Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia are the most flagrant 
examples. 
  In Bosnia it had long been clear that sending in blue 
helmets 
was more of an excuse for failing to get seriously involved with 
the problem than a remedy. The blue helmets had to look on 
powerless at the misery of war, and became targets themselves. 
But their very presence was used as an argument for not taking 
stronger action against the aggressors, for fear of reprisals 
against the blue helmets. If the UN peacekeeping troops thus 
become part of the problem in an area of conflict rather than 
part of the solution, then peacekeeping is clearly due for new 
rules and a more decisive and preventive approach. 
  In the meantime, the United States and Russia, which have 
played the leading roles in the peace process in Bosnia, must 
ensure that the Bosnian Serbs respect UN troops and resolutions, 
and thus restore interest in a peaceful solution.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Paul De Bruyn: "Russians Distance Themselves </F>
From West Again"] 
  [Text] The confirmation that Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev will not, after all, be coming to visit NATO 
Headquarters on Thursday [21 April] to sign the Partnership for 
Peace [PFP] no longer came as a surprise. Over the past few 
days it had already become clear that Moscow (for the time 
being) feels unable to consolidate such a cooperative link with 
the Western alliance. The reason given by Kozyrev, his 
colleague Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, and others, was that 
the United Nations and NATO did not inform them about the air 
strikes launched against Bosnian Serb positions. Moscow 
describes this as a breach of confidence and as proof that the 
West is still not prepared to regard the Russians as full 
partners. Moscow wishes to express its displeasure at this, 
authoritative sources claim. 
  While nobody would deny that the latest developments in 
Bosnia have indeed not gone as the Russians might have wanted 
(the United States, in particular, is emphatically attempting to 
weaken the position the Russians have built up for themselves), 
this alibi is far too comfortable. So the question arises as to 
whether Moscow has not merely waited for an appropriate moment 
to put off its rapprochement with the West. After all, in 
February the Russians themselves agreed that the UN commanders 
in Bosnia had the authority to request NATO actions. So they 
knew that no further approval by the Security Council was 
necessary in this respect. 
  For anyone within NATO it is clear that the Russian 
hesitation to sign up with the Partnership for Peace can be 
directly attributed to the power struggle over foreign policy 
which has long been fought out behind the scenes in Moscow. 
Although "ultranationalist" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would appear 
to have been neutralized, his influence is still filtering 
through in many circles. He is playing on the latent fear among 
the Russian people that from now on Russia will only be a 
second-rate power. Figures like Kozyrev, who is regarded among 
the pro-Western Russians, are not in a sufficiently strong 
position to turn around the tide of nationalistic, anti-Western 
feeling. They cannot convince their opponents that it would be 
advantageous for Moscow to cooperate with NATO. Moreover, it is 
noticeable that President Boris Yeltsin is not playing any role 
in this debate, possibly the clearest indication yet that he is 
finished. 
  Consequently, Moscow is immediately confronting NATO with a 
new dilemma. The Partnership for Peace, limited though it may 
be, was not only a way of offering the countries of Central and 
East Europe a prospect of NATO membership, but was also intended 
to set off the dangers of a shattering Soviet Union. By 
bringing Russia and other former republics into play in a 
cooperative alliance, the West counted on averting potential 
unrest within the armed forces. However, that calculation 
presupposed that Moscow would play a subordinate role to 
Washington. Now that Moscow appears unprepared to do this, NATO 
is once again faced with problems that it thought it had solved. 
  A Partnership for Peace without Russian participation is 
dangerous. The hardliners in Moscow could exploit such a 
situation by asserting that the West is indeed out to isolate 
Russia. That would not benefit pro-Western elements. However, 
such a situation merely consolidates the worst fears of the 
countries of Central and East Europe. They were scared to death 
of a development whereby Russia would once again adopt an 
anti-Western stance while they had no guarantee of security. 
Precisely that is now threatening to happen. 
  The Partnership was meant to give all parties involved the 
time they required to prepare for full NATO membership. There 
would now appear to be little chance of any quiet preparations. 
NATO diplomats will once again have to show all their creative 
flair to find a way out of the situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brinkman Sends Ball Back to </F>
Lubbers' Court"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, the former CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal] leader, clashed with Elco 
Brinkman, the CDA's leading candidate, last weekend over 
influence within the party. 
  A day after Lubbers publicly expressed doubts about 
Brinkman's suitability as prime minister, the CDA's leading 
candidate made it clear that he had not found the remark 
helpful. "I am and remain available for the prime 
ministership," he said. 
  He said it was "a complicating factor" that the CDA had two 
leaders. "I have always thought that and still do," he said. 
"But I am keeping the ship on course, even if there is an 
occasional wind." Brinkman, who was campaigning in Friesland 
over the weekend, said that "Lubbers is now really saying 
goodbye and he is having trouble passing on the baton." 
  Lubbers said on Friday evening [during a television talk 
show] that he thought Wim Kok, PvdA [Labor Party] leader, would 
be "just as good a prime minister" as his party colleague 
Brinkman. The prime minister said he thought it was "a pity" 
that a tradition had developed whereby the leading election 
candidates automatically became candidates for the prime 
ministership. "I have praised Brinkman as my successor as the 
leader of the CDA, but I have never said: Here stands the new 
prime minister of the Netherlands," Lubbers said. 
  He admitted that he had seen the CDA's decline coming 
several 
months ago. "It was difficult for Brinkman to support the 
cabinet and at the same time to mark out a new course for after 
the elections," Lubbers said. "I have had sleepless nights 
about it." 
  Brinkman reacted with contained anger and indirect criticism 
of Lubbers' third cabinet. "I did not have sleepless nights 
about that," Brinkman said. "But I do get them about increasing 
unemployment, another 15 people without a job every hour, the 
real feeling of insecurity on the streets, and the pressure on 
the social security system, if we do not act." 
  The leading candidate had noticed that the prime minister 
had 
"problems giving up." Talking of his tense relationship with 
Lubbers, Brinkman said "taking leave is apparently hurting. He 
announced his departure four years ago and now it is right 
before him." He said he had not discussed the matter with 
Lubbers yet. "But I will do next time I meet him face to face," 
Brinkman said. 
  Brinkman also said that he was still available for the prime 
ministership. "It would after all be peculiar for the CDA to 
set off with a leading candidate who was not available to lead 
the country. If the CDA says that Brinkman is number one, then 
that is the case and that will continue to be the case. I will 
keep a steady course, even if there is an occasional wind. In 
any event I am available for the prime ministership, although 
that will only be decided when the government is formed."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bolkestein Challenges Democrats 66 </F>
To `Build a Bridge'"] 
  [Excerpt] Frits Bolkestein, VVD [People's Party for Freedom 
and Democracy] leader, is not ruling out a "purple" coalition 
between the PvdA [Labor Party], the VVD, and the D66 [Democrats 
66] but does not want to speak out in favor of such a 
possibility at present. He is not ruling out "any serious 
party." Nor does he want to indicate his preference. 
  Yesterday, in a speech at the Erasmus University in 
Rotterdam, he reproached his D66 colleague Van Mierlo for always 
emphatically having flirted with the "purple coalition," 
adopting the viewpoint that if the CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal] is stripped of its central power position, then "the 
whole face of the Netherlands will change." 
  In response to the remarks made by Bolkestein, yesterday 
evening in Middelburg, D66 party leader Hans Van Mierlo said 
that he may be prepared to take the lead in forming a "purple" 
coalition including the D66, the VVD, and the PvdA. 
  However, according to Van Mierlo, which party will have to 
adopt a leading role in this respect will depend on the outcome 
of the elections: "Three parties are involved in such a 
`purple' coalition. Furthermore, such an undertaking requires 
great wisdom and unanimity." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Democrats 66 Scoring Highest Among </F>
Students"] 
  [Excerpt] Apparently, Netherlands students are no longer 
adhering to ideologies. Indeed, if the Netherlands were one big 
university, the D66 [Democrats 66] would be the biggest party 
and [D66 leader] Hans van Mierlo would be the unchallenged 
leader. 
  This was revealed by a representative sample conducted among 
the future generation of intellectuals by Specifiek Universitair 
Magazine (SUM). Another remarkable fact, especially in 
comparison with the 60's, is that the PvdA [Labor Party] would 
be wiped out. 
  The figures: The D66 gets almost 30 percent of the student 
votes, the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 19 
percent, the GroenLinks [Green Left] 13 percent, the CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal] 12 percent, and the PvdA only 5 
percent. The students make a fairly conscious choice. Almost 
half of them determine their choice based on a party's ideas and 
principles. This is what should alarm the PvdA most. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Poll Encouraging For Christian </F>
Democratic Appeal"] 
  [Text] The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and PvdA 
[Labor Party] seem to be running neck-in-neck on which party 
will be the biggest after the elections. This was revealed in a 
poll conducted by the Inter/View office on behalf of ANP Press 
Agency and Nova. The figures indicate that both parties would 
attract exactly the same number of voters, i.e., 21.2 percent, 
which would give them 33 seats each. 
  Inter/View gave the CDA more of a chance than NIPO 
[Netherlands Institute for Public Opinion Polls], which forecast 
the day before yesterday that the Christian Democrats would get 
only 28 seats. Inter/View says that the divergent results 
reflect the offices' different polling methods. 
  CDA leader Brinkman was happy with the figures published by 
Inter/View: "A 10 percent gain in one day, that is what I call 
an advance," he said during an electoral meeting in Assen 
yesterday. 
  On that occasion, he criticized his colleagues Wim Kok 
(PvdA) 
and Bolkestein (VVD -- People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy). Last weekend, the latter expressed their intention 
to govern with the D66 [Democrats 66] after the elections. A 
third party, necessary for a parliamentary majority, could then 
join them. Brinkman says: "I am not going to form a cabinet 
right now. Let us first wait for the voters' verdict." 
  Lower Chamber President Deetman (CDA) also criticized the 
present coalition partner, PvdA. Deetman agrees with Prime 
Minister Lubbers, who blamed the PvdA last week for making a 
"turn to the left." Deetman discerned the PvdA's more left-wing 
orientation from statements by PvdA leader Kok. Together with 
the D66, the latter wants to see to it that left-wing ministers 
are in the majority in a new cabinet. 
  Yesterday night in Assen, the Chamber president cautioned 
his 
fellow party members for a progressive policy. "Social security 
will fall apart then because, instead of changing the system, 
all hopes will be placed on better times." Deetman also fears 
that a cabinet where the "left" will be in the majority will not 
cut the budget deficit sufficiently, which in his view will be 
detrimental for employment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Failure in Gorazde"] </F>
  [Text] Last weekend, the crisis about Gorazde, which was 
declared a "safe area" by the United Nations, reached a chaotic 
and dangerous phase. According to reliable sources, Serb tanks 
were only a few hundred yards from the center of the city last 
Sunday night. 
  The attempts by the United Nations, NATO, and the Russians 
to 
end the Serb offensive launched against Gorazde on 30 March were 
a total failure as a result of a series of miscalculations, 
internal disagreements, and clumsy attempts at military action. 
  General Michael Rose, UN Commander in Bosnia, initially 
underestimated the meaning of the Serb offensive. Then the Serb 
assailants were unexpectedly encouraged by the United States. 
Defense Secretary Perry and Chairman, Joint Chiefs, General 
Shalikashvili stated that the impending fall of Gorazde would 
not be a reason for the United States to launch air strikes. 
  A week and a half ago, Secretary Christopher and President 
Clinton corrected that view, but Gorazde was already on the 
verge of falling. At General Rose's request, two NATO bombings 
followed. They were not important from the military point of 
view, but it was hoped that they would have a psychological 
impact. 
  However, this impact was largely undone by Russian President 
Yeltsin's disapproving reaction to the NATO action, in spite of 
negotiator Churkin's subsequent diplomatic attempts to urge the 
Serbs to withdraw. The latest result of these efforts was last 
Sunday afternoon's agreement on a Serb withdrawal to 3 km 
outside Gorazde, and the stationing of 350 UN military personnel 
there. 
  However, the Serbs make fools of their Russian friends just 
as easily as they do NATO and the United Nations. Karadzic and 
General Mladic intimidated the latter and labelled them as 
enemies. They even shot down a NATO airplane last Saturday. The 
fact that the subsequently requested air support was not given 
completes the international community's failure. The impression 
of panic at the United Nations is strengthened by Yashushi 
Akashi's inexcusable statement last Saturday, that UNPROFOR 
should perhaps withdraw from Bosnia altogether. 
  Loss of face for NATO, panic at the United Nations, the 
whole 
situation is very alarming. Even worse is that Gorazde's 
failure has undone the sobering effect which the Sarajevo 
ultimatum had on the Serbs. Karadzic has regained both the 
military and diplomatic initiative.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd tonight welcomed U.S. 
proposals for widening the threat of air strikes to protect 
Bosnia's safe havens and intensifying sanctions on Serbia. He 
said the United States and Europe were at one over the way 
forward, and it was necessary to co-ordinate the military effort 
on the ground and in the air. 
  Washington wants to widen the threat of air strikes to 
protect other United Nations safe havens and impose stiffer 
sanctions on Serbia, which backs the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Mr Hurd said: "I believe that the United States and the 
European allies are now at one on the main points. Yes we need 
to use air power, not because it is magic, not because it will 
itself bring peace, but because it can be useful in protecting 
the safe areas. Yes we need to keep sanctions strong and indeed 
strengthen them where we can, where there are loopholes. Yes we 
need UN troops on the ground, more troops. I hope the President 
will be able to say America is no longer having to block the 
financing of other people's troops, UN troops, on the ground in 
Bosnia. I hope other countries will now come forward with 
troops." 
  But, on Channel 4 News, he stressed the only way the war 
would end was through a negotiated settlement. And Mr Hurd said 
he could imagine a situation when the UN had to withdraw from 
the war zone and leave the fighting factions to battle it out. 
"I can imagine a situation in which the UN and the 
international effort had collapsed and there was no grounds 
therefore for preventing the sides from fighting it out. I 
think its very dangerous, tragic and might lead to a spread of 
the war," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by anchorman </F>
Jon Snow; Hurd in the Westminister studio, Snow in London; from 
the "Channel 4" news program -- live] 
  [Text] [Snow] Foreign Secretary, you have seen the shelling 
still going on in Gorazde. What can we do? 
  [Hurd] Well, we have not so far succeeded in Gorazde in 
doing 
what we managed to do in Sarajevo and central Bosnia, which is, 
bringing the fighting to an end. So General Rose, the UN, have 
to go on seeking to make the situation better if they can, and 
meanwhile we have to consider, we have to judge -- as your 
report from NATO has just said -- how we can strengthen the 
effort, how we can make sure that we have more successes like 
that in Sarajevo and central Bosnia, and fewer failures like 
that in Gorazde. 
  [Snow] Well now, clearly one of the main pushes of 
diplomatic 
activity has been on this idea of widening the facility to call 
in air strikes, to include the protecting of the safe areas -- 
in other words extending it beyond simply protecting UN 
personnel. But tonight, Mr. Kozyrev, the Russian foreign 
minister, was saying that this they will not support from Moscow 
unless there is already an absolute agreement, a common stance 
as he puts it, between Moscow, Brussels, and Washington. 
  [Hurd] We need to involve the Russians. I don't believe the 
measures which the secretary general is proposing needs a new 
Security Council resolution. What it does need, and what it 
will now get from NATO, is detailed military staff work. We 
have got troops on the ground, British and French in particular, 
other Europeans, other countries, there are NATO forces in the 
air. What is needed now, and what will now happen, is to work 
out how these two can work together more effectively -- it's no 
good dealing with air without the ground. More ground trooops 
are needed. It's no good dealing with the ground without using 
the NATO air assets. That's what the NATO decision today says. 
  [Snow] Alright, 50 minutes from now President Clinton will 
announce what he is going to do. What do you want to hear from 
him? 
  [Hurd] He's announced what he is putting to his allies. I 
believe that the United States and the European allies are now 
at one on the main points. Yes we need to use air power, not 
because it's magic, not because it will itself bring peace, but 
because it can be useful in protecting the safe areas. Yes we 
need to keep sanctions strong and indeed strengthen them where 
we can, where there are loopholes. Yes we need UN troops on the 
ground -- more troops. I hope the President will be able to say 
that America is no longer having to block the financing of other 
people's troops, UN troops on the ground in Bosnia. I hope that 
other countries will now come forward with troops as we and the 
French and others have done. And finally, you need to have a 
negotiated solution, that is the only way this war is going to 
end -- as the French foreign minister said again today in his 
parliament, and that means bringing together what the Russians 
are trying to do, what David Owen is trying to do, what Mr. 
Stoltenberg is trying to do for the UN, and what the American 
Ambassador Redman is trying to do. It's not good having 
diplomats going the rounds, doing their own little bit without 
having a concerted effort by the international community, and 
that's what we are pressing for. 
  [Snow] But we still have two bones of contention with the 
Americans, the first is the arms embargo against the Bosnian 
Muslims which, as Gorazde shows, surely remains a very unjust 
position -- and the Americans feel very strongly that it is 
unjust, and the second is the failure of the Americans to match 
air power with ground force? 
  [Hurd] On your first point, I can imagine and have long 
talked about a possibility that at the end of the day, if all 
the UN efforts failed or the European efforts failed, and we 
came to the conclusion that we had to pull out our troops, there 
wasn't any longer any point in trying to stop this war. I can 
imagine then a situation in which the UN and international 
effort had collapsed and there were no grounds therefore for 
preventing the sides from fighting it out. I think it's very 
dangerous, tragic, and might lead to a spread of the war. I can 
imagine that at the end of the day, I think it would be bad for 
everybody concerned, but I see the logic of that. 
  On your first point: It's for the Americans as it is for the 
Germans and the Italians and others who do not have ground 
troops [in Bosnia] to assess when and in what circumstances they 
could join in. We have to accept the situation as it is, 
whether it is the British, French, Spaniards, and one or two 
other European countries -- Russians or Ukrainians who are on 
the ground, and the Americans giving a lot of help from the air, 
a lot of help in the form of aid and civilian activity, but we 
do have to make sure that the ground and the air effort work 
together and there are no gaps or loop holes between them.

  [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has called on Britain 
to reassert its economic presence in Asia. Mr. Goh said British 
businesses had a long relationship with Asia and it would be 
ironic if Britain is seen in the future as a lesser player in 
the growing Asian economy. 
  Speaking in London at a banquet hosted by its lord mayor, 
Mr. 
Goh said Singapore and Britain have of late, emphasized 
different priorities. He noted Britain is reorientated towards 
Europe and Singapore towards its ASEAN neighbors. 
  Mr. Goh said if this trend continues, the historical ties 
may 
loosen and this will not be to their advantage. The prime 
minister said in Asia, Britain enjoys a clear comparative 
advantage over many of its European partners. Its economic 
presence in Singapore and Hong Kong is substantial. Mr. Goh 
assured British investors that Singapore provides ready platform 
for British companies to launch their business interests in Asia. 
  In his address the lord mayor of London, (Paul Neil), called 
on Singapore companies and investors to plan for the new and 
large European markets. He said Singapore and Britain share 
impeccable credentials of free trading nations.

<F P=106> [Richard Savill report: "1,000 Police Raid IRA Paymasters"] </F>
  [Text] Police in England and on both sides of the Irish 
border raided more than 40 addresses yesterday in a huge 
operation against IRA fund-raising. They seized computers, 
documents and large quantities of drugs. 
  Up to 1,000 officers from six police forces, co-ordinated by 
the Royal Ulster Constabulary's [RUC] specialist C13 
anti-racketeering squad, took part in the operation. It came 
after 12 months of "intensive investigations" into the 
terrorists' financial activities. 
  Operation "Madronna", designed to halt the 6 million pounds 
a 
year that flows to the IRA to purchase its arms and explosives, 
was unprecedented in its scale and scope. 
  In simultaneous dawn raids, heavily armed units searched 41 
premises -- eight in the north-west of England, 14 in London and 
Surrey, eight in Northern Ireland and 11 in the Irish Republic. 
  The RUC said that eight people were arrested and officers 
seized a "substantial" quantity of drugs, stolen property and 
money. 
  Four people were detained in the south-east of England, 
including one held after raids on addresses in Woking, Surrey, 
and four in the Republic but none in Northern Ireland. 
  Computers and a large amount of documents, some of which are 
believed to relate to building society and bank accounts, were 
also seized. 
  Irish police said they could not confirm a report that a key 
IRA financier who headed the wanted list had evaded capture. 
  In the Republic, addresses were raided in Dundalk and 
Dublin. 
One security source said: "We are trying to tie the purse 
strings of IRA active service units in Britain." 
  In Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland 
Secretary, welcomed the operation. "The funds for terrorist 
organisations are important. If you get hold of their funds 
then you prevent them from doing the worst things they wish to 
do." 
  Mr Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist MP for East 
Belfast, said: "The use of apparently legitimate businesses as a 
front for funding terrorism has been a long standing problem and 
people in Northern Ireland will be eager to determine the scale 
of this operation and the consequences to the bankrolling of the 
IRA."

<F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION news correspondent] </F>
  [Text] American law enforcement agencies failed to 
intercept a consignment of detonators bound for Ulster 
terrorists because they believed the IRA was only going to use 
them for testing purposes, a television report claims tonight. 
  In fact, after sending them across the Atlantic, the 
Provisionals used the detonators in a bombing campaign in Ulster 
and England, according to the BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight 
programme. 
  The devices, made by a U.S. firm and allegedly bought by a 
Belfast man in Arizona, started turning up three years ago in an 
assortment of bombs. Others were found in unexploded bombs in 
England, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. 
  American agents posing as arms dealers and involved in a 
so-called sting operation agreed to sell a Stinger 
surface-to-air missile to the man who, it is claimed, also told 
them of his plans to buy 2,900 detonators. 
  Kevin McKinley was later arrested for his part in the 
missile 
sale, but the detonators were sent to Ireland, the report says. 
  Details emerged at a trial in Tucson where four other 
Irishmen and two Americans face charges connected to the sale. 
The case is expected to end soon. 
  According to the report, the U.S. authorities failed to keep 
a tail on McKinley after he unwittingly warned them of his plans 
to buy the detonators. Had they known they were going to be 
used for bombs, he probably would have been followed, one agent 
claimed. 
  One of the defence lawyers at the hearing claimed the law 
enforcement agencies were more interested in a successful 
"sting" involving the missile. 
  Bates Butler said: "Even though they had been told 
detonators 
were involved, they didn't care...it could have been stopped."

  [Text] A policeman was killed and two of his colleages are 
seriously ill in hospital today after a suspected mortar attack 
on a mobile patrol in Northern Ireland. Their Land Rover was 
rocked by a blast as it drove along Spencer Road, in the 
Waterside area of Londonderry, shortly before midnight. 
  The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] confirmed that one male 
officer was killed, and two others "very seriously injured" in 
the attack. Early today a spokesperson at the town's 
Altnagelvin Hospital said the two injured officers were in "a 
very serious condition." 
  The blast was heard over a wide area of Londonderry. 
Security forces sealed off the largely commercial road before 
beginning a search operation. An RUC spokesman said the attack 
was being treated as ther work of the IRA. 
  Earlier in the evening, a man was shot and injured at a 
police checkpoint in South Armagh. Police said the man was 
taken to hospital suffering from a leg wound after a number of 
shots were fired by police at a civilian vehicle. Another man 
was arrested. 
  An investigation was mounted after the incident at Ballsmill 
Road near Silverbridge. The scene is a few miles from 
Crossmaglen, where a major security operation has been mounted 
in recent days at the start of major re-building work at the 
village security base which has been regularly attacked by the 
IRA.

  [Text] Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua has begun his visit 
to Canada by saying his country can't grow in the next century 
without help. Speaking in Vancouver, Mr. Zou urged a business 
audience to invest more in China, especially in the transport, 
energy, agriculture, communications, and mining sectors. Trade 
between Canada and China is worth more than $4 billion a year. 
  Prime Minister Jean Chretien will visit China in November, 
becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since the 1989 
massacre of pro-democracy activists in Beijing. Mr. Chretien 
has said that human rights questions should not deter closer 
trade links between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Address by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to the Bundestag </F>
in Bonn on 13 April] 
  Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen. In his eulogy for 
the victims of the terrible act of arson in Solingen on 3 June 
1993, President von Weizsaecker correctly described 
German-Turkish relations as friendship between peoples. This 
friendship has a long and exemplary tradition. It is an 
important commodity for us, in foreign policy terms and in human 
terms. The Federal Government has a firm desire to care for 
this commodity also in difficult times. 
  Close cooperation with Turkey is no special interest of 
Germany's. Rather, it is a common objective of NATO and the 
European Union [EU]. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and 
the transformations in Central and East Europe, Turkey has 
gained even greater significance as a bridgehead between Europe 
and Asia and as a stabilizing factor within the Muslim world, 
and it requires solidarity particularly now. 
  Prime Minister Ciller has just announced an economic 
stabilization program that calls for harsh measures and 
sacrifices. At the same time, the country is being put to the 
test by the strengthening of Islam. The Iraqi Kurd leader 
Talabani, with whom I am due to hold talks this evening, has 
just said that he considers the "growing fundamentalism" in 
Turkey "a common threat both to the Kurds and to the Turkish 
Government." 
  But, Ladies and Gentlemen, friendly relations, such as the 
ones we maintain vis-a-vis Turkey, also involve the need for 
each side to inform the other side as friend and partner about 
any problems that exist. In this context, it must be said that 
the situation with human rights and that of the Kurdish 
population in Turkey is not satisfactory. On the contrary, the 
situation has deteriorated. The EU admitted the same thing in a 
31 March 1994 declaration on the subject of human rights in 
Turkey. 
  This declaration was brought on by lifting parliamentary 
immunity and arresting Kurdish deputies in the Turkish 
Parliament at the beginning of March. Immediately after 
receiving confirmation of the first reports on this subject, the 
Federal Government pointed out that measures against freely 
elected members of the Turkish Parliament create the impression 
that the voice of the Kurdish population in Turkey is being 
suppressed. 
  Both bilaterally and on an EU level, we have expressed our 
expectations that the Kurdish deputies will be permitted to 
avail themselves of their constitutional rights. In this 
connection, the Federal Government trusts in the impartiality of 
Turkish justice. 
  Together with Douglas Hurd, my British colleague, on 20 
January I held a frank discussion with my colleague Cetin, who 
is himself a Kurd, and with whom I happen to have been in touch 
over the past few days, and still am. A recurrent subject of 
our talks is the situation with the Christians and Yezidis, 
torture during police custody, and restrictions on the freedom 
of speech and opinion. 
  So that there are no misunderstandings, Ladies and 
Gentlemen: 
The Federal Government naturally considers combating the 
terrorist Kurdish Workers Party to be legitimate. But even 
combating terrorism must adhere to the framework of the rule of 
law and the norms of human rights that Turkey has also 
recognized. 
  The Federal Government believes, and we have said so again 
and again in our talks, that the Kurdish issue, which is a 
problem not only in Turkey, can only be resolved by peaceful 
means and in mutual agreement between the Turkish Government and 
the Kurds. Such a solution must respect and guarantee the 
cultural identity of the Kurdish population.

  [Text] Bonn, Germany April 09 (A.A.) -- Turkish ambassador 
to Germany Onur Oymen said today that the friendly feelings of 
Turks are being damaged continuously by the German media. 
  Speaking at a "roundtable meeting" led by Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and which aimed at preventing xenophobia, Oymen said that a 
number of German TV stations broadcast anti-Turkish programs. 
  Oymen said that 2 million Turks were living in this country 
and the programs against their homeland hurt their feelings. 
  "These broadcasts are one-sided and the same old archive 
films are shown again and again, hurting the pride of Turks," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Joerg Bischof article: "Like a Fish in Water"] </F>
  [Text] In mid-February this year it happened again: Five 
noncommissioned officer cadets died and 26 soldiers of the 
Turkish Army were injured, some of them seriously, when a bomb 
exploded at the railroad station of the Istanbul suburb of 
Tuzla. It was hidden in a trash can, and the timer was set for 
0910 local time . This was precisely that time when every 
Saturday hundreds of soldiers wait on the platform to go away 
for the weekend. 
  The left-wing extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) 
claimed responsibility for the attack, which tore off the arms 
and legs of many victims. And it did not shy away from having 
its KURD-A information service, which operates from Germany, 
announce to Turkish newspapers and news magazines by telefax 
that a "revenge team" of the PKK's military arm will carry out 
further attacks on Turkish towns and vacation resorts on the 
Turkish Adriatic. This showed the security authorities that the 
PKK organization is still intact, even though it has meanwhile 
been banned in Germany, too. 
  In Turkey the PKK has been on the list of banned extremist 
organizations for years. On 26 November last year, after a 
difficult decisionmaking process, FRG Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther came round to formally classifying the PKK in Germany as 
a terrorist group and banning it and 35 cover organizations, 
including a Kurdish "cultural and friendship association," a PKK 
publishing company, and the KURD-A press agency, which is still 
active despite the ban. The security authorities expect the 
other cover organizations, at best, to scale down their public 
activities. Underground, however, the PKK will probably continue 
to be active. Its assets had probably already been removed when 
the police enforced the ban in a raid on 26 November. 
<H5>  Hardly To Be Determined </H5>
  The decision was probably not easy for Kanther, because the 
PKK organization in Germany can hardly be determined exactly by 
security authorities. Even though last year several acts of 
violence against Turkish consulates, banks, and airlines in 
Mainz, Darmstadt, Hannover, and Munich, which were planned to 
the minute, showed that the PKK, which was founded in 1978 and 
is controlled by General Secretary Abdullah Ocalan from Syria, 
is able to "mobilize" its estimated 5,000 activists in Germany 
practically any time. It showed that most recently on 4 
November 1993 with a well-planned series of attacks, which 
affected not only Germany but also other countries in Europe. 
Nevertheless, the security authorities have so far been 
restrained regarding countermeasures, because the PKK is 
swimming "like a fish in the water," as Mao Zedong's famous 
saying goes, of the total of 15 Kurdish liberation movements and 
skillfully exploits for its own purposes the sympathetic 
feelings of the German people for Kurdistan's freedom struggle. 
  When Kanther finally used the club of an official ban 
against 
the PKK, it was probably not so much for reasons of security 
policy as foreign policy. For years Ankara had been urging the 
government in Bonn to dry up the PKK's field of action in 
Germany and to officially stress the difference between the 
terrorist organization and the legal liberation movements in 
Kurdistan. It was Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who was the 
essential influence in the cabinet. He primarily wants to 
cultivate good relations with Ankara, because Turkey plays an 
important role for Bonn, as Germany's traditional friend, as a 
"bridge" to the Turkish peoples in the south of the former 
Soviet Union, and as the only Islamic power in NATO. 
<H5>  For Socialism </H5>
  German security authorities classify the PKK as a 
Marxist-Leninist organization, which uses its military arm, the 
People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan (ARGK), formerly 
Liberation Unit of Kurdistan (HRK), to bring about a socialist 
Kurdistan and thus the separation from Turkey, Syria, Iran, and 
Iraq. Other, moderate Kurdish groups, which mainly come from 
the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, on the other hand, content 
themselves with the demand for more autonomy of their 
compatriots within these states. In Germany the PKK operated 
several subgroups until it was banned, e.g. the National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan (ERNK) propaganda organization or 
the Association of Patriotic Artists of Kurdistan (HUNERKOM) 
cultural organization, which can hardly be distinguished from 
the moderate Kurdish "cultural associations." 
  Constitutional Protection classifies it as "for years the 
most active and most militant association" among the 15 leftist 
Kurdish groups in Germany. In particular it pursues a tough 
struggle, also on German soil, against its rivals from the 
moderate wing of the Kurdish freedom movement, such as Devrimici 
Isci. In 1990 police found the corpse of former PKK member 
Abdulla Hosgoren in a plastic bag. He had been executed as a 
"traitor" six years before because he reportedly worked for 
Devrimici Isci and prevented revenge murders. Previously, PKK 
General Secretary Abdullah Ocalan had made it known via the 
"Kurdistan Report" how the PKK deals with defectors: "We will 
put them on the operating table and save what can be saved; 
those who do not survive this procedure will be left to 
liquidation." 
  The PKK is extremely skillful with its strategy. Protest 
actions intended to draw the German people's attention to the 
Kurdish problem, have generally been peaceful. Women and 
children were used. In contrast, the terrorist organization has 
not shied away from open violence when it acted against Turkish 
authorities and institutions in Germany. 
<H5>  Strong Influx </H5>
  One of the reasons for the ban was the strong influx of 
followers the PKK had experienced in Germany over the past 
years. Up to 25,000 Kurds participated in an International 
Kurdistan Festival of the PKK cultural organization in Bochum in 
1992. A little later, 12,000 persons marched "against treason" 
in Frankfurt am Main. When, at the end of 1992, it advertised 
elections for a Kurdish National Parliament in Europe, the PKK 
was warned because of activities that are impermissible under 
the Aliens' Law. Increasingly frequently cases have come to 
light in which PKK activists extorted money for the liberation 
struggle from Kurds in Germany.

<F P=106> [Josef Hufelschulte article: "Blackmailers in a Friendly </F>
Country"] 
  [Text] The meeting place is the highway exit north, to the 
left of the first traffic light behind the bridge. Time: 1130 
hours, Sunday. Mustafa Sari is careful. Instead of his private 
address, he has given only a telephone number -- if we miss each 
other. 
  The man is chain-smoking. Mustafa Sari, 45 and holder of a 
diploma in economics, is nervous. His hands shake, he talks 
without interruption. The topic: the Turkish intelligence 
service, MIT for short. Sari reports how the MIT gave him a 
grilling. 
  Changing places, a hotel in Bonn. Loud music in the piano 
bar, understanding each other is difficult. Nevertheless, 
journalist Fatih G. repeatedly lowers his voice when he talks 
about the Turkish National Information Agency -- which is the 
official name of the MIT. The topics are dubious figures, 
blackmail, and dirty tricks in a friendly country. 
  One does not joke about the MIT; it is best to have nothing 
to do with the MIT. For the 2 million Turks in the FRG, the MIT 
is as sinister as the Stasi used to be for GDR citizens. 
  Germany is the number one area for operations: Here, in 
large cities like Berlin and Cologne, the Turkish surveillance 
apparatus sees the invisible frontline in the war against 
militant separatists. MIT agents are spying on the supporters 
of the terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). However, 
they also intimidate other opposition members and, for instance, 
threaten asylum-seekers with reprisals against relatives in 
Turkey. 
  The MIT does not do anything obvious. The German authorities 
have kept silent for years. The reason: The MIT is classified 
as a friendly intelligence service of NATO partner Turkey. The 
result: If the spies from Ankara become too active, "one slaps 
their wrists at most instead of making everything public," as is 
casually noted in Bonn security circles. 
  Hartmut Ferse, director of the Hesse Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, is an exception. In the 
discussion about Kurdish demonstrators he frankly accused the 
Turkish intelligence service of illegal activities on German 
soil. 
  The Bonn Interior Ministry, which officially does not want 
to 
say anything about the MIT, also knows quite well what Ankara's 
agents are doing in Germany. 
  One example: Employees of the Turkish Consulates in Hamburg 
and Stuttgart wanted to recruit spies from Turkish opposition 
circles in 1990. The alleged diplomats, who were uncovered as 
MIT agents by the constitutional protection office, threatened 
and blackmailed their would-be spies -- this is clearly proved 
by monitored telephone conversations. 
  As a result, 15 Turkish intelligence agents were silently -- 
as is usual among NATO partners -- expelled from the country -- 
an icy period between Ankara and Bonn. At the time. 
  By July 1992 at the latest, everything had been settled 
again. State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, coordinator of the 
intelligence services in the Chancellor's Office, Federal Office 
for the Protection of the Constitution President Eckart 
Werthebach, and Federal Intelligence Office (BND) chief Konrad 
Porzner went on a secret visit to central Anatolia. There, 
while tea, pastries, and good raki [Turkish liquor] were served, 
new oaths of loyalty were sworn on cooperation between the 
German and Turkish services. 
  Cooperation has always been intensive. 
  The Berlin Administrative Court was convinced that an asylum 
procedure (file VG 19 A 329.82) clearly proved that the BND from 
Pullach near Munich regularly passed on information from the 
files of Turkish dissidents to Ankara. 
  The result: After returning to Turkey, rejected 
asylum-seekers are arrested and confronted with their statements 
made in Germany about political persecution in Turkey. 
  "If the Turks had their way, we would have to arrest and 
deport 100 Kurds per day," an official of the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigations (BKA) describes the zeal of the German 
MIT section. 
  However, even without energetic help the Turkish 
intelligence 
service manages perfect surveillance. 
  The listening posts are the approximately 700 state mosques 
in Germany. According to research done by FOCUS, the imams, who 
are paid by the consulates, are obliged as spiritual leaders to 
write a detailed report about the inner workings of the Turkish 
communities every four months. In case of "matters pertaining 
to internal security," the operation, codenamed Prosperity, 
demands that the respective consulate is to be notified 
immediately. 
  The MIT is taking the offensive in time: Via the daily 
HURRIYET of 29 September 1992, teachers and doctors who live in 
Germany were called upon to take secret photos of suspicious 
Turks and to send three copies of the pictures to information 
attache Ulvi Yavuz in Ankara within 15 days. 
  If national security is involved, the Turkish intelligence 
service does not stop with Germans, either, according to 
reliable information obtained by FOCUS: Dossiers are 
painstakingly compiled about journalists, who, in the view of 
MIT, report all too critically about the government in Ankara. 
  The secret files about Ankara's alleged enemies in Germany 
are kept in a safe place. The mosque in Venlower Strasse in 
Cologne is considered to be the MIT headquarters in the FRG. 
About 30 controllers of agents pursue their covert work on the 
second floor there. The MIT residency in Berlin has an equally 
perfect cover -- from the fourth floor of the state agricultural 
bank, Ziraat Bankasi, the scene in Kreuzberg is being spied on. 
  The Turkish intelligence service, which is always looking 
for new unofficial employees, is able to take its pick in 
Germany. Many desired candidates speak German better than 
Turkish, work at banks and airlines, in travel agencies and 
offices. Most of them are more familiar with Hamburg-Altona or 
Cologne-Ehrenfeld than Istanbul. 
  The intelligence service already takes advantage of that 
when 
it recruits people. 
  Any young Turk, regardless of whether he was born or grew up 
in Germany, is drafted into the military service by Ankara. For 
a sum of at least 10,000 German marks, he can, quite legally, 
reduce his military service from the actual 20 months to four to 
eight weeks until his 38th birthday. 
  Several FOCUS informers report concurrently that at Burdur 
barracks near Antalya young Turks from abroad are gathered 
together and approached by the intelligence service. 
  Economist Mustafa Sari, who came to Burdur at the age of 31, 
remembers his first MIT contacts: "We were about 1,200 soldiers 
in the barracks. One day we got questionnaires. We were told 
to write down which Turkish groups we knew and who is against 
the government. We were supposed to give names, blacken people." 
  Journalist Fatih G. also learned that the young recruits 
were 
thus writing their first spying reports. Back in Germany after 
the brief military service, the MIT does not loosen its grip on 
them. 
  Anyone who wants to get out is intimidated. One does not get 
his passport extended for staying in Germany, another is 
suddenly suspected of supporting terrorist circles -- which 
might lead to arrest in Turkey. Beatings on order in Germany 
come from the fascist Gray Wolves, who, according to 
constitutional protection findings, are clearly controlled by 
the MIT. 
  Mustafa Sari, who publicly pilloried the MIT practice in 
lectures after his military service, is convinced that he was 
subjected to the toughest measures: During a visit to Ankara an 
unknown man fired at him -- the bullet injured two innocent 
people in the street. 
  An MIT operation might also be behind the sudden 
disappearance of Turkish opposition members from Germany -- such 
incidents had been hitherto unknown. 
  According to investigations by FOCUS, four members of 
Devrimci Sol (Revolutionary Left), a party that is persecuted in 
Turkey, requested political asylum in Stuttgart and Frankfurt in 
1982. 
  In 1986 MIT agents lured the opposition members into a trap. 
During a dinner in Stuttgart among alleged comrades, the four 
Dev-Sol activists were reportedly anesthetized and taken to 
Ankara on a passenger flight of Turkish Airlines. 
  Relatives say that only in 1988 did they receive any 
indication that the missing persons were still alive. They were 
in the feared Mamak military prison in Ankara; according to 
official reports, they had been arrested during a raid in 
Turkey. The sentence: 17 years in prison for each of them. 
  Two men have meanwhile been released from prison. Hakan 
reportedly squealed to the MIT about his comrades. Ibrahim was 
no longer fit to be in prison -- Mamak prison caused him to end 
up in a wheelchair.

  [Text] During their talks in Bonn yesterday, Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl especially 
discussed international and regional issues of mutual concern as 
well as bilateral ties. After the talks, Pakistan's Foreign 
Secretary Najmuddin Sheikh, told newsmen that the talks between 
the two leaders were held in an extremely cordial atmosphere 
wherein there was complete understanding and unanimity of views. 
  The prime minister and the German chancellor expressed deep 
concern over the situation created in Bosnia-Herzegovina due to 
the aggression by the Serbs and demanded the lifting of the arms 
embargo on the Muslims to enable them to defend themselves. 
Chancellor Kohl briefed the Pakistani leader of his efforts, 
including his telephone talks with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and other world leaders, to halt the Serbian attacks on 
the Bosnian Muslims. Apprising the German Chancellor of the 
situation in occupied Kashmir, Benazir Bhutto said that, owing 
to the Indian atrocities, the occupied valley has become the 
Asian Bosnia. She said despite political apprehensions at home, 
she expressed readiness for foreign secretary-level talks with 
India, but, India vitiated the situation before the start of the 
dialogue. Pakistan had to take the Kashmir issue to the UN 
General Assembly and later to the UN Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva. She said whenever this issue is raised at international 
level, there is some reduction in Indian atrocities. Therefore, 
the international community should maintain its pressure on 
India to save the Kashmiris from the atrocities. Chancellor 
Kohl said Germany is fully aware of the Kashmir problem and has 
apprised the Indian Government of its concern over the 
atrocities and gross human rights violations in occupied 
Kashmir. He expressed the hope that a peaceful solution to the 
issue will be found at the earliest. During the discussion on 
bilateral issues, the prime minister made several proposals to 
enhance economic cooperation between Pakistan and Germany. The 
prime minister stressed the need for resuming German commodity 
assistance and credit facilities to developmental financial 
institutions in Pakistan. The German chancellor said his 
government will soon give a positive response to Pakistan. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said as long as the Kashmir 
issue remains unresolved, permanent peace cannot be established 
in South Asia. Answering queries after her address to a German 
organization on foreign policy in Bonn last night, she appealed 
to the international community, especially the Western 
countries, to raise their voices to prevent the gross human 
rights violation in occupied Kashmir and to exert pressure on 
India for a solution to the issue and fulfill its pledges to the 
international community to grant the right of self-determination 
to the Kashmiris. She made it clear that until a solution is 
found to the Kashmir dispute on the basis of the right to 
self-determination, the threat of proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and missiles will persist and defense expenditures will 
mount. She said Pakistan believes in a peaceful solution to the 
Kashmir dispute through dialogue and has begun secretary-level 
talks with India. She regretted that before and after the 
talks, Indian troops committed massacres in occupied Kashmir, 
particularly in Sopor and Kupwara. The prime minister also 
expressed regret that India did not pay attention to Pakistan's 
appeals for permission to human rights organizations and foreign 
diplomats to visit occupied Kashmir to investigate the situation 
there. When Pakistan brought the issue before the UN Human 
Rights Commission, India agreed to grant permission not only to 
the human rights organizations but to foreign diplomats as well. 
Referring to the presence of 600,000 Indian soldiers in 
occupied Kashmir, the prime minister said that, after the World 
War II, such a vast number of occupation forces could not be 
seen in any part of the world. Referring to the Indian 
allegations about the unrest created by Pakistan in occupied 
Kashmir, Benazir Bhutto said her country is ready for the 
deployment of UN troop contingents along the Line of Control for 
verification of the facts. She emphatically stated that the 
freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir was launched by the people 
themselves and Pakistan has always supported the right of 
self-determination of the people there and it cannot give up its 
support to the just struggle of the Kashmiris. On the nuclear 
issue, she said Pakistan is determined to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and despite a nuclear explosion 
by India, Pakistan has exercised extreme restraint. Pakistan has 
also agreed on several occasions to the U.S. proposal for talks 
on the issue. On Afghanistan, the prime minister said Pakistan 
sincerely wants the establishment of peace in this brotherly 
country. She made it clear that her country will never support 
any particular group. Pakistan, however, will continue its 
efforts to normalize the situation in Afghanistan. 
  In her address to the German organization on foreign policy, 
the prime minister said there is extensive scope for meaningful 
cooperation in South Asia. However, benefits could not be 
reaped due to the unfavorable situation created by the 
outstanding disputes between various countries. She said it is 
regrettable that India not only hinders a peaceful solution to 
the disputes with its neighbors, but increased the hardships of 
its small neighbors as well.

  [Text] Pakistan and Germany signed an agreement on economic 
cooperation under which Germany will provide assistance worth 85 
million marks [DM] to Pakistan for various projects in the 
social sector. The agreement was signed in Bonn yesterday. 
This assistance will be in addition to the DM190.4 million 
pledged by Germany, which has not yet been utilized. German 
State Secretary (Jargon Trunk) said this agreement reflects the 
desire of the German Government to play its role in the economic 
development of Pakistan, especially in the sectors identified as 
priority sectors by the Benazir Bhutto government.

  [Text] Addressing the German parliament's Economic Affairs 
Committee in Bonn today, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto urged the 
German parliament members to play their role to resolve the 
Kashmir issue so that the amount expended for arms and 
ammunition can be spent on development. The prime minister said 
if a settlement to the Kashmir dispute is achieved, all other 
issues between Pakistan and India will also be resolved. 
Referring to the 20-percent increase in the Indian defense 
budget, the prime minister said it is basically aimed at 
crushing the freedom movement in occupied Kashmir. 
Nevertheless, this increase has also put pressure on Pakistan 
to take appropriate steps to deal with any threat to its 
security. The prime minister said Pakistan had made several 
proposals to India for mutual reduction of forces, for reducing 
defense expenditure, for preventing nuclear proliferation and an 
arms race, and for resolving the Kashmir dispute, but India has 
not demonstrated any positive reaction to any of these issues. 
  Referring to internal affairs, the prime minister said her 
government has granted several concessions that ensure extensive 
opportunities to foreign investors in Pakistan. She said all 
foreign investors are totally safe in Pakistan, as the benefit 
of nationalizing institutions in the current age of market 
economy has ended. German investors can play a dominant role in 
Pakistan's development. The prime minister said Pakistan's 
territory is extremely attractive and profitable for investors 
as its economy is progressing toward stability. The country is 
replete with natural resources and the best business 
opportunities are available here due to its location in an 
important region of the world.

  [Text] The foreign ministers of Pakistan and Germany held 
detailed discussion in Bonn today on a number of issues of 
mutual concern and of regional and international importance. 
Later, Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told 
Radio Pakistan's special representative that he had informed Mr. 
Kinkel of Pakistan's sincere desire to amicably resolve the 
Kashmir problem and normalize its relations with India. But, he 
said, India has not responded positively to various proposals 
presented by Pakistan to realize this objective. Mr. Kinkel 
said Germany was fully aware of the situation in Indian-held 
Kashmir and the importance of the Kashmir dispute in 
Pakistan-India relations. He assured that Germany would make 
efforts to persuade India to find a peaceful solution of the 
Kashmir problem. Mr. Kinkel was also briefed on Pakistan's 
efforts to bring about peace in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and 
Somalia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Criticism of Washington"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- "It would come as no surprise if short-term 
interest rates went up again in the United States," said Otto 
Graf Lambsdorff, economic spokesman for the Bundestag's FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] faction, following talks that he had 
held in Washington and Japan. A 3-percent economic growth might 
be achieved in the United States this year, "relatively free of 
inflation," he said. But the U.S. Federal Reserve is worried 
about the stability of the dollar in 1995. Lambsdorff expects 
an increase in medium-term U.S. interest rates to prevent 
inflation. 
  While satisfied with U.S. industrial policy, the FDP 
politician sharply criticized Washington's trade and foreign 
policy. The U.S. trend toward bilateral trade agreements is bad 
news not only for Japan, Europe, and the developing countries, 
but also for entire world trade, said Lambsdorff. He said he 
hoped Washington would adhere to the GATT rules agreed upon in 
Marrakesh last week. 
  In U.S. foreign policy, Lambsdorff fails to see not only a 
clear line, but also persons who could develop such a line. In 
this connection, he described the challenge posed by North Korea 
as the greatest problem. "North Korea is not of sound mind," he 
said. 
  Lambsdorff returned from Tokyo with the realization that 
Japan is strengthening its investment efforts in Asia. Because 
Japanese exports are no longer so dependent on the U.S. market 
as they used to be, Japan is no longer so submissive in the 
trade dispute with Washington. Although German industry has 
"missed" the economic growth in Asia, Lambsdorff says "there is 
a chance for us if we involve ourselves there seriously." This 
chance is mainly the result of the fact that not all Asian 
countries are happy about the economic expansion of the Japanese 
there.

  [Text] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- German Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt urged Russia to make full use of the Hermes 
guarantees for trade with Germany. The survival of many German 
firms, especially in the former East Germany, depends on this, 
Rexrodt told journalists after a talk with his Russian 
counterpart Aleksandr Shokhin in Moscow today. 
  Hermes credits total 2.5 billion marks [DM] this year. 
Shokhin pointed out that Russia "is subject both to internal 
restrictions and IMF conditions with regard to debts." 
  Rexrodt called on German industry to invest in Russia 
despite 
all the difficulties there. It must not miss the right 
opportunity to "gain a foothold on the Russian market and its 
great potential." He conveyed to Shokhin the wish felt by many 
German businessmen "for greater clarity and predictability in 
Russia, among other things in the tax system and in granting 
export licenses," Rexrodt said. He added that Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to Germany in mid-May and 
preparations for the next session of the German-Russian 
Cooperation Council in St. Petersburg were also discussed. 
  Rexrodt arrived in Moscow last night for a one-day visit. He 
is to hold talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Karl-Ludwig Guensche report: "Kliningrad as a Test"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian 
Social Union) will meet with representatives of German 
enterprises in Kaliningrad today. He wants to familiarize 
himself with projects of the Trust Agency East European Advisory 
Office that are being supported by the Federal Government. 
Waigel is coming from St. Petersburg where he attended the 
annual meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Developments. During his stop in 
Kaliningrad, he will also discuss the current state of the 
establishment of the free trade zone with the head of the 
Territorial Administration, Jantar. 
  In the meantime, the four foreign-policy experts of the 
CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union], 
Bundestag members Wilfried Boehm, Hartmut Koschyk, Friedbert 
Pflueger, and Christian Schmidt, have thought about 
Kaliningrad's future role. A "document on the current state" by 
the foreign affairs working group of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group 
states that the Kaliningrad region is a "number one all-European 
security problem." The area has been an "extremely isloated 
military colony for the past 50 years." A preservation or the 
expansion of the military concentration would "certainly trigger 
fears of Russian military predominance," it might provoke 
military countermeasures, disturb the peaceful development in 
the Baltic states and in the whole of Central Europe 
considerably, and "basically endanger Europe's entire security 
architecture after the end of the Cold War." 
  For this reason, the future of the Russian part of eastern 
Prussia does not only concern Russia alone, the CDU/CSU 
officials stressed. The West European states should try to 
remind Russia of its responsibility and ensure the gradual 
reduction of the military presence in the Kaliningrad region. 
The CDU/CSU politicians pointed out that the influx of Russian 
soldiers and weapons that are being withdrawn from Germany and 
"parked" in Kaliningrad may add to the danger that Kaliningrad 
might become a "crisis region." Already, at this point, 200,000 
men are deployed there. A regional arms race might develop. 
The three Baltic states in particular might feel "even more 
encircled than today." 
  The measures that have so far been taken by the Russian 
Government to ensure a peaceful development in the region are 
not sufficient in the view of the CDU/CSU officials. Thus, it 
is the task of the West Europeans to try and exert influence. 
This is particularly necessary at a time when Russia is 
defining its security policy anew. Even if Yeltsin should 
succeed in implementing his reform course, one must proceed from 
the premise "that the military component will continue to remain 
a decisive factor of Russian policies." Thus, there will be no 
opportunity for a complete demilitarization of the Kaliningrad 
region in the foreseeable future. Yet the West must ensure that 
this territory will only become an outer defense bastion within 
the framework of a general defense concept to protect Russian 
territory. 
  Russia's behavior in this region will be a test for the 
entire policy of Russia. The Russians must be asked to enter 
into a security-political dialogue with their neighbors. The 
Bundestag members suggested drafting joint solutions with the 
Russians within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, the CSCE, and the European Council.

<F P=106> ["cr"-signed report: "Pawlak Demands Opening of German </F>
Markets for Construction Companies"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn/Warsaw -- Poland's 17 creditor states, 
which are associated in the Paris Club, have reduced Poland's 
debts by $8 billion, Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki 
announced in Warsaw on Friday [14 April]. This puts into 
practice the 21 April 1991 decision to reduce by 50 percent the 
$33 billion debts. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking before representatives of industry at the 
Federation 
of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], Poland's 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak acknowledged the role that German 
banks have played in speeding up this agreement. Pawlak is 
convinced that the agreement could considerably reduce the 
financial risk involved in trading with Poland and allow an 
opening of normal credit lines for financing trade and 
investment projects. 
  The Polish head of government was, however, less pleased 
with 
bilateral conditions for investment and market access. Pawlak 
said that there is not enough willingness in Germany to invest 
in Poland. The situation is especially serious in the 
construction industry. Poland's supplies in this field have 
declined from 2.5 billion German marks [DM] to DM500 million. 
Pawlak said he hopes that Polish companies will be given free 
access to German markets in the future. 
  Although Poland had a DM1.5 billion deficit in trade with 
Germany last year, Pawlak is optimistic about the future, 
because the volume of trade has tripled to DM18 billion over the 
past four years. This has made Poland Germany's number one 
trading partner in Central and East Europe. As Poland's most 
important trading partner, Germany provides one-third of 
Poland's entire foreign trade volume. 
  One of the reasons for Pawlak's optimistic view is the 
realization of new forms of institutional cooperation of entire 
border regions that "contribute to a deepening of cooperation in 
almost all fields." The newly established society for 
industrial promotion intends to support this development. It 
will be the task of this society to help establish contacts 
between partners in the fields of trade and investment, 
establish contacts with national and international banks, and 
provide advice. Business will also be promoted by the 
Warsaw-based Polish-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry that 
has now been "put into practice." 
  Poland, which is associated with the European Union [EU], 
has 
formally applied for full EU membership. Pawlak was pleased 
with the political support that Bonn has promised to give Poland 
on its way into the European Union, and he pointed out that all 
the legal and structural reform measures that are currently 
being enforced are market-oriented. Parallel to the changes in 
the system, the Polish economy shows clear signs of recovery, 
with an inflation rate that is decreasing comparatively quickly. 
Thus, industrial production in the first quarter of 1994 
increased by 10 percent over December 1993, while prices only 
went up by 5 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf </F>
Scharping by Zbynek Petracek; place and date not given: "The 
Time Has Come for a Change"] 
  [Text] Rudolf Scharping is chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] of Germany and is also minister-president 
of North Rhine-Westphalia. He reached the highest echelons in 
German politics only last June, but -- despite this -- the 
majority of the FRG's citizens now consider him to be the next 
German chancellor. He should achieve this goal following the 
elections to the Bundestag in October. 
  [Petracek] You are 46 years old, the same age as Bill 
Clinton when he began his presidential campaign, and the SPD has 
been in opposition for 12 years, the same span of time for which 
the Democratic Party in the United States had to entrust the 
White House to the Republicans. Do you consider Bill Clinton to 
be a specific model for yourself and for the SPD? In which 
sense? 
  [Scharping] Such a direct comparison is always undesirable 
as there are many things that simply cannot be compared. It is 
true, however, that both during the Clinton campaign in the 
United States and now in Germany, many people were and are 
convinced that the time has come for a change in the political 
leadership, that the current government has become worn out, and 
that it has run out of ideas for dealing with the challenges of 
the present and the future. 
  [Petracek] You appear in the media and in public more 
openly, more naturally, more convivially, and more sportsmanlike 
than is normal among the German political elite. Here, too, it 
would be possible to discern a certain similarity to Bill 
Clinton. Is this part of your program? Do you want to thus 
suppress or overcome the distaste for politics often expressed 
among German citizens? 
  [Scharping] Participation in the elections last month and 
also participation and involvement in political activities 
recently have shown that talk about antipathy toward politics 
has been exaggerated. It has been a long time since people were 
interested in politics. There is, of course, indignation toward 
individual politicians and also toward political behavior and 
the means of political decisionmaking. This situation has 
arisen because the truth has been concealed from the people, and 
because "the ratio between value and performance" in politics is 
often discordant. This can only be dealt with by speaking 
candidly and honestly about the general conditions -- which have 
become complicated -- and by seeking a solution to them together. 
  [Petracek] What do you say to the fact that the Czech 
Republic is the last state whose victims of World War II have 
still not been compensated by Germany? 
  [Scharping] The SPD faction in the Bundestag submitted a 
proposal in January 1991 in which it demanded that, in 
connection with the signing of the German-Czechoslovak treaty, a 
foundation be established -- in accordance with the solution 
agreed with Poland -- to benefit the Czechoslovak victims of 
Nazism. Naturally, this also applies under the changed 
politico-state groupings. We must indeed strive bilaterally to 
overcome the traumas of history to the benefit of our common 
future. I am coming to Prague in order to contribute to this. 
  [Petracek] Clinton's election slogan was "change." What 
slogan will the SPD and you personally use to try to win over 
the German voters? 
  [Scharping] The capital "W" of our election campaign stands 
for "Wir" [We], "Wechsel" [Change], and "Wahlen" [Elections], 
because this year's elections to the Bundestag must bring about 
political change so that this country again becomes fit for the 
challenges that lie ahead of us. Our main motto is "certainty 
instead of anxiety" according to the view that Willy Brandt once 
formulated as follows: "Whoever wants to live in certainty 
tomorrow must take care of the reforms today." Our policy is 
oriented toward ensuring that people in this country can be 
certain that their jobs and homes are safe and that they can 
live with their neighbors at home and abroad in security and 
peace. 
<H5>  The Social Wolf and the Taxation Goat </H5>
  [Petracek] Some 70 percent of FRG citizens believe that 
there will be a change in government following the autumn 
elections. However, according to the ZDF television channel's 
"political barometer," only 29 percent of Germans are convinced 
that the SPD would cope with the economic problems better than 
the current government coalition. A substantial difference is 
evident in this issue between Germany in 1994 and the United 
States in 1992. Do you agree with this view? 
  [Scharping] I am skeptical about polls. Therefore, I always 
issue an urgent warning: Do not allow yourself to be overly 
influenced by them in political practice. Incidentally, I could 
also quote to you from polls that ascribe more economic 
proficiency to us than to the current government. We have just 
completed the draft of our policy statement, which we are now 
making available for discussion throughout the country. I am 
certain that our ideas for dealing with the economic problems 
will then gain even greater support than hitherto. 
  [Petracek] According to this draft, another 200,000 social 
apartments, for example, are to be built within two years. At 
the same time, however, payroll and income taxes among the 
lowest and average income categories are to be reduced and -- in 
the event that new enterprises are established -- the 
"improvement of conditions for private stock by means of 
taxation measures" is being taken into consideration. How does 
this go together -- lower income taxes and higher social 
expenditures? Where would your government get the necessary 
resources? 
  [Scharping] The tax burden for 1995, already set by the 
Federal Government, is very high. It must not be increased 
further. Therefore, we are planning changes in favor of economic 
progress and social justice. It is essential to relieve the 
burden on people with low and average incomes, because those on 
the minimum subsistence level are exempt from taxation as 
decreed by the Federal Constitutional Court. We need a fair 
adjustment in expenditures for pan-German recovery. Our 
proposals for appropriate supplementary benefits are on the 
table. It is possible to save money by means of strict 
expenditure discipline and by modernizing the state; we are 
taking this into consideration. Finally, the investment stimuli 
planned by us to create jobs and intended to favor ecologically 
sustainable growth will increase the state's financial scope. 
  [Petracek] The SPD's draft policy statement gives the vague 
impression that it was written by Hillary Clinton: First and 
foremost in the passage "On Equality" where female quotas for 
vocational and training centers -- in enterprises with more than 
50 employees -- and objective support for women in research 
facilities and at universities are envisaged. Do you really 
think that such quotas can lead to genuine equality? 
  [Scharping] The experience of women in Germany has shown 
that equality, if not mandatorily endorsed by a form of fixed 
quotas, is probably unattainable. Since the SPD thoroughly 
implemented its resolution on quotas, equality in our party has 
made a great deal of progress to the benefit of political 
discussion in this country. What applies in politics must also 
be applicable in the world of work to the benefit of women and 
families. 
<H5>  You Must Seek a Relationship With Russia </H5>
  [Petracek] Like Bill Clinton, you are also reproached for 
your lack of foreign policy experience. You yourself have also 
said, in the spirit of the current U.S. President, that "what is 
achieved abroad depends a great deal on what is done at home." 
Nevertheless, despite this, can you define your foreign policy 
priorities? 
  [Scharping] First and foremost, the social and economic 
tasks associated with German unity are the main priority. 
However, it is clear to me that German reunification has 
expanded our foreign political responsibility in Europe and 
throughout the world. We want to place considerable foreign 
policy emphasis -- along with our partners from the European 
Union -- on support for the reform processes in Central and East 
Europe, since we will not be able to cope with these challenges 
without a pan-European perspective. We see another focal point 
in environment and environmental resources policy and in 
reducing the gap between North and South -- it is only possible 
to approach these tasks internationally with the involvement, 
first and foremost, of North America and Japan. 
  [Petracek] It is no secret that there is a dispute within 
the SPD on the possibility of the deployment of Bundeswehr 
units. The issue involves whether German soldiers -- under UN 
orders -- should only take part in peacekeeping operations or 
also in peacemaking missions. What is your view? 
  [Scharping] There was a dispute within the SPD on the 
Bundeswehr's deployment, but we have already reached a 
consensus, which is clear from the resolution approved at our 
recent party congress. According to it, we endorse all the 
operations that the United Nations may carry out on its own 
responsibility; these are primarily peacekeeping missions 
(deployment of the blue helmets). Moreover, the SPD is in favor 
of enforcing embargoes imposed in an attempt to quell military 
flash-points -- should the need arise -- by a blockade. 
Incidentally, I also see an important sphere for cooperation 
between Germany and its neighbors in joint exercises for 
intervention within the UN framework, since the need for UN 
peace missions -- and later, the deployment of CSCE blue helmets 
-- will, by all accounts, increase. 
  [Petracek] In your opinion, should Germany gain a permanent 
seat in an expanded UN Security Council in the future? Under 
what circumstances? 
  [Scharping] We social democrats are of the opinion that, if 
the circle of permanent Security Council members is expanded, 
the important countries and regions of the world must be 
represented. We would give preference to a joint European Union 
seat, which, however, is unfeasible in the foreseeable future. 
Therefore, Germany -- like Japan -- is a candidate for a 
permanent seat in the UN Security Council. The United Nations 
is not setting down special conditions, as the general secretary 
of the global organization has said repeatedly. Of course, it 
is rightly to be expected of Germany that it will contribute to 
strengthening the United Nations in accordance with its 
potential. 
  [Petracek] As the German media have noted, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel did not protest when in November his 
Russian counterpart Kozyrev expressed himself in favor of a 
"German-Russian axis." How would you react in such a situation 
-- as federal chancellor? 
  [Scharping] We are aware of the fears of smaller states that 
the larger ones can reach an agreement behind their backs. Such 
uneasiness was manifested particularly strongly during the 
period of German reunification -- and definitely not only in the 
Central European states to the east of us. At that time, 
Germany undertook to deal responsibly with its increased 
influence, and respect for the interests of our neighbors forms 
the main part of this. On the one hand, it is clear that it 
would have been impossible to achieve peace and security in 
Europe without cooperation with and the understanding of Russia. 
On the other hand, however, it is just as clear that a German 
agreement with Russia would certainly not suffice to guarantee 
stability in Europe. Thanks to the stabilizing influence of 
democracy, the Central European countries are appearing 
self-confidently on the international arena, which is also 
leading them into a situation in which they must again seek a 
relationship with the Russian Federation. West European or 
German policy cannot replace this, but can only support it. 
<H5>  What Social Dumping Means </H5>
  [Petracek] In your interview for DER SPIEGEL, you pleaded 
for "more social justice." How do you intend to achieve this 
aim since the possibilities of the welfare state have now been 
virtually exhausted? 
  [Scharping] I have already mentioned that we are planning 
changes in the system of taxes and levies, which will lighten 
the burden on people with low and average incomes. Our 
intention to pay the same allowance of 250 German marks for each 
child, instead of the current system of allowances exempt from 
taxation, will also lead to greater social justice. By 
implementing changes in housing construction it is also possible 
to attain the strong support of those who are really dependent 
on it. In the final analysis, our views on modernizing the 
state also concern our social security systems -- there will be 
less red tape and the distance from the citizens will be 
lessened. The "welfare state" is not to be used freely, but it 
must be reformed in keeping with the times. 
  [Petracek] In the same interview, you also said that there 
would be no social democracy in Germany without the SPD -- not 
as a political trend (Sozialdemokratie), but as a specific type 
of democracy (soziale Demokratie). Can you explain this 
semantic difference? What is the difference between social 
democracy and democracy without attributes? 
  [Scharping] I consider renewing social democracy in Germany 
to be a fundamental task of political social democracy. No one 
is denying that our country is arranged democratically, but the 
social aspect of our statehood has come up too briefly in recent 
years. Redistribution from the bottom upwards is more than a 
slogan; it is a sad reality provable by the figures. In a 
social democracy there should be tasks that belong to the common 
interest that are commonly shared and financed. Incidentally, 
this is a constitutional requirement in our country, since the 
market economy itself cannot now guarantee social justice. 
  [Petracek] You use the word "social" very often. What do 
you think of the concept of "social -- or rather, ecological -- 
dumping," especially since the SPD is concerned, first and 
foremost, with employment and cheap labor in Central and East 
Europe may threaten jobs in Germany? 
  [Scharping] If the low price of the goods offered is derived 
exclusively from the fact that these products come from 
enterprises that cause great ecological damage and whose 
employees have to work in undignified conditions, then I speak 
about ecological or social dumping. Therefore, we are striving 
for international agreements on minimum social and ecological 
standards. However, do not view this as a pretext for 
protectionism, which is harmful to all economies.

<F P=106> [Interview with PDS presidential candidate Jens Reich by </F>
Juergen Gottschlich and Matthias Geis; place and date not given: 
"It Doesn't Look So Shabby With Me"] 
  [Text]Jens Reich, candidate for the federal 
presidency, on the parties and the nation, the term solution as 
a substitute for policy, the courage to take risks, his pacifism 
and NATO, and naturally the GDR, the PDS [Party for Democratic 
Socialism], and the developing nostalgia. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Reich, you have also characterized your 
candidacy as a reaction to the disinterest in parties and 
politics. After the election in Lower Saxony, the diagnosis of 
the mood in the society is that the disinterest in politics is 
waning. Do you think that this diagnosis is wrong? 
  [Reich] I have always thought that the forecasts for a 
meager 
participation in the so-called superelection year were 
premature. The people also want to have some influence, even if 
it is ultimately only an interest in the result, the sporting 
side, as in a horse race. But I would be very careful about 
interpreting this is a newly awakened enthusiasm for politics. 
It is gratifying if the election turnout is being normalized but 
one cannot conclude from this that the population's ill humor 
with politics is already over. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] The result was interpreted above all by the 
two people's parties in accordance with the motto: there is 
increasing acceptance for that which is well-proved and the 
situation is becoming stable. 
  [Reich] It may be that the intensity of the indifference 
with 
politics and the restlessness in the population have diminshed 
somewhat and it may be there has been somewhat of a decline in 
attacks by radical rightists. But that is scarcely a reason for 
the parties to give the all-clear signal. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] But the chance for your candidacy lies 
precisely in the great insecurity about the future capability of 
established politics. Are the reactions to your candidacy also 
changing? 
  [Reich] In the political class or in the populace? 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] How do the reactions differ? 
  [Reich] They differ clearly. For the population, my 
candidacy 
appears to be downright provocative. It fills the halls and 
evokes approval and opposition. That is no different in the new 
laender than it is in Munich. Two years ago, I would not have 
expected that one could find a lot of interest in such themes as 
the constitution and plebiscites. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] That would more likely confirm the thesis of 
the end of indifference with politics or at least suggest a 
clear differentiation between the parties and indifference with 
politics. 
  [Reich] I believe that, if anything, the situation has 
improved for such debates. There is a willingness to sacrifice 
freedom for public discourse. There is political movement. That 
does not mean the end of indifference with politics but here one 
can see a way out of this indifference. The people want to have 
a say and to participate in decisions. For 40 years the people 
in the west have shown that they can live in the democratically 
constituted society and in the east they showed in October 1989 
that they can end a dictatorship and build democracy in a 
sensible way. The people are ready to be allowed to present 
initiatives and to be involved more directly in the political 
process. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] How is the political class reacting to your 
candidacy? 
  [Reich] I get neither criticism nor approval. There is no 
longer a cartel of silence as there was at the beginning. There 
is much civility and sobriety. Everyone has his candidate and 
yet they are quite satisfied that there is also someone there 
from the east so that it will not look quite so shabby. My 
candidacy has at least shown that one can introduce into the 
conversation someone who is not drawing from 20 years of 
experience in Bonn and it has certainly contributed to the 
politicizing of the candidacy for the highest public office. For 
the first time, there has been a serious public discussion about 
the candidates. The parties did not want to have this taken away 
from them but it really has become a social policy event. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Nevertheless some people will ask: Why is 
Jens 
Reich still a candidate, although it is already apparent that 
his prospects for being elected federal president are no longer 
especially good? 
  [Reich] Because of the candidacy and the associated 
opportunity even more than in the past to bring up themes that 
are controversial in the long term. After all, there is the 
widespread attitude that in an election year one should not talk 
about the future and the gradually developing crises. That is so 
for ecology just as it is for the future of the social welfare 
state or the generation pact as it exists today. The parties are 
trying to carry on the election campaign without risk. The motto 
is "low profile." But it is precisely the risky themes and the 
controversial proposals that must be injected into the election 
campaign. Instead we are experiencing trivial discussions about 
personnel; people are stirring up the past; and the question of 
whether Egon Bahr, Mr. Jenninger, or Mr. Strauss once made deals 
with Mr. Axen is taken more seriously than the question of the 
future of our tax system. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you think that the political system of the 
FRG with a legislative period of four years and the modalities 
that that involves is in any sort of a position to overcome such 
fundamental crises? 
  [Reich] I believe that our four-year cycle has now become an 
obsession that prevents attempts at fundamental solutions. 
Instead crisis management dominates. We live in intervals of 
four years and no one dares to tackle a project of the century 
in this short interval. That has to do with the remarkable 
position that under no circumstances should one risk an election 
defeat. The correct attitude ought to be: we now have four years 
and in this time we will do what we consider essential. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] But precisely the problems that you have 
mentioned can hardly be tackled in such a way that decisive 
success can be demonstrated after one legislative period. The 
ozone hole cannot be handled in one legislative period. 
  [Reich] But vigorous measures are conceivable. No policy 
that 
undertakes something in these areas can be finished after four 
years, and one can also admit this from the outset. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] But the parties are hesitant, because the 
actions that take effect in the long term immediately involve 
considerable burdens--from the speed limit to the increase in 
the mineral oil tax. 
  [Reich] The cowardice of not saying anything at all and of 
dealing with the major critical themes only with general phrases 
produces the loss of confidence that continually narrows the 
latitude for political action. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you have the impression that the society 
is 
ready to give up anything in the interest of unity? 
  [Reich] I sense that opposition will come quickly when a 
specific sacrifice is called for. On the other hand, Helmut Kohl 
is being reproached for not having made any 
blood-sweat-and-tears speeches in 1990 to prepare the citizens 
for the demands on them. How is it that everyone would have been 
ready to sacrifice then and why is there massive opposition 
today when one takes them at their word about being willing to 
sacrifice? 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] How can material cuts be accomplished 
politically? Is that a question of political conviction or can 
that ultimately be done only by decree? 
  [Reich] Anyone who wants to become federal chancellor must 
say what unavoidable burdens are coming for society, and he must 
also promise that these burdens will be spread evenly throughout 
the entire population. In regard to the question of financing as 
well, the large parties must enter the election campaign with 
controversial proposals. Then both of them will risk losing the 
election but at the same time there is a greater chance that in 
the end there will be a concept with which one can govern. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Does that mean that a really good policy is 
always the one that makes one unpopular? And conversely, a 
policy that is oriented primarily toward immediate approval will 
not be convincing in the long term? 
  [Reich] A good policy would be one that produces tension, 
that presents truly clear alternatives, and that risks missing 
the majority in the election but provides the necessary latitude 
for action in the event of success, because it has clearly 
presented its proposed solutions even during the election 
campaign. That cannot be done with a "low profile." Take 
Brandt's ostpolitik. That was a clearly formulated and highly 
controversial project that was put to a vote and was confirmed 
by a large majority. That is an example of how one must enter an 
election with a controversial concept. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Is that equally valid for the east and west? 
Is there a convergence between the two societies or, just as in 
1990, are there largely different publics? 
  [Reich] I do not know to what extent the consciousness in 
the 
east has changed. Are the people, who are in a relatively 
difficult material situation, nevertheless able to undertake an 
ecological reorganization of the economy and industry? The fact 
that we come from a considerably lower level of consumption 
could facilitate a fundamental change. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you see signs of a willingness to make 
material sacrifices? 
  [Reich] Yes, there are signs. Welcome money and bananas are 
no longer the central objective in the east as well. The desire 
from 1989 to enter into full consumption quickly and at the same 
time to attempt a kind of settlement of the entire past culture 
has failed. There is a growing awareness that the race to catch 
up with what was missed in the 1950's and 1960's can no longer 
be the supreme goal. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] But the failure of the high expectations with 
respect to consumption does not necessarily lead to a 
willingness for sacrifice and reform. There is a growing 
nostalgia for the GDR and rising popularity for the PDS. 
  [Reich] The decisive thing for the success of the PDS seems 
to me to be the fact that it is the only party in the new 
laender that has been able to create an atmosphere. It attends 
to the club facilities and house communities--people who were 
once in the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] and who now 
support each other. It advises people on rent and pensions. The 
other parties do not engage in this kind of support in the local 
environment. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Is that the reason for the Kutzmutz effect? 
  [Reich] One must realize that there are 20 or 30 percent of 
the people who are marked as representatives of the old regime 
and also perceive themselves as such. They are often people who 
were involved in the FDJ [Free German Youth] since their early 
childhood, who took that as a matter of course, and who were 
quite shocked by the events of 1989 and are now seeking 
emotional support. That is not some ultraleftist radicalinsky 
theory. It is their milieu. This is why proposals for banning 
the PDS are absurd. Only someone who is very far away can call 
for this. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you see the necessity of reorienting the 
debate about the past? 
  [Reich] The past of the SED should have been dealt with in 
the enthusiasm of the revolution in 1989 and should have been an 
internal affair of the GDR. The historical process proceeded 
differently. This treatment of the past, above all juridically, 
was postponed, and unification took place before the GDR was 
terminated. Here lies the dilemma that has led to the truly 
absurd construct under which today political offenses from the 
time of the SED are dealt with in the formal framework of 
criminal procedures of the FRG, but materially in accordance 
with GDR law. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Reich, for many years you have had 
contacts in the East European states, and since the revolution 
in 1989 you have repeatedly called for a political, economic, 
and cultural opening of Germany and West Europe to the East. How 
do you assess the debate about the expansion of NATO and the 
rift between the former Soviet satellite states and Russia? 
  [Reich] I am very much a pacifist by nature. On 8 April 
1945, 
my mother and I were fired upon by the guns of a low-altitude 
aircraft. I experienced the bombing raids and my father was held 
prisoner. I belong to the generation that said "never again," 
and for this reason I would love to leave military matters far 
behind. I think that the East European countries must be 
integrated into a security system without thereby excluding 
certain countries. That is certainly very difficult in the case 
of Russia, but I consider it a task that we must face just as an 
expansion of the EU [European Union] to the East even if that 
delays the integration in the West. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Your friends from the former civic movement 
in 
Prague or Warsaw are counting on an integration into NATO that 
excludes Russia. 
  [Reich] I think that we must slow down the very enthusiastic 
supporters of NATO among those in the civic movement. I would 
consider it to be a great historic mistake to exclude the former 
Soviet Union and to establish a source of unrest on the other 
side of the Limes. That would mean considerable polarization. 
The question is this: How must the existing alliance be 
restructured to make an offer to all of these countries that 
will make it impossible to wage war? 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] The counterargument that is often made is 
that 
integration must proceed very quickly to do something to 
counteract the virulent nationalism, above all in Russia. 
  [Reich] I do not have so much fear of Eastern nationalism. I 
see it as a mental straw in the shock situation of the upheaval. 
Yugoslavia is an extreme example that was wrongly influenced 
from outside and driven to escalation through extreme 
unreasonableness internally. I believe that the fear of a new 
Russian hegemony is unrealistic if we are really serious about a 
new security strategy and economic integration.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New RAF Suspicion"] </F>
  [Text] Klaus Steinmetz, the spy for the Federal Office for 
the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], who brought the 
security authorities to the trail of suspected terrorists Birgit 
Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams and thus caused the police operation 
in Bad Kleinen, is suspected of having perhaps been involved in 
crimes committed by the Red Army Faction (RAF) after all. In 
February and March, two vehicles were discovered that had been 
registered to Steinmetz in the past: a Honda Civic passenger 
car and a Suzuki 750 motorcycle. According to the chief federal 
prosecutor's office, both vehicles might have been used by the 
RAF for attacks. 
  According to findings by the Hesse police, the motorcycle 
might have been used for escape in six bank robberies. In the 
car investigators found traces of the explosive element 
nitropenta, among others, on gloves that had been left in the 
car. Such traces were also found by investigators after the 
blowing up of the new prison in Weiterstadt near Darmstadt in 
March 1993, for which the RAF claimed responsibility. 
  At first, Steinmetz told the BfV that he had known about the 
attack on the prison. Later on, however, he denied this 
self-incrimination and presented an alibi. Since the 
authorities do not know which of his versions is correct, there 
are comprehensive checks being conducted at the moment. Thus, 
it was noticed that traces of saliva on cigarette butts which 
were found in Steinmetz' car are identical to traces on butts 
which were found in connection with the Weiterstadt case. 
Whether the butt really came from the liaison man is now 
supposed to be clarified by producing a so-called genetic 
fingerprint. The blood sample necessary for that is available: 
Some time ago, Steinmetz voluntarily agreed to have a blood 
sample taken, because he believed that as a witness he need not 
fear anything. 
  Since the car and the motorcycle were used by many members 
of 
the autonomous scene before and after the operation in Bad 
Kleinen, a new investigation by the chief prosecutor's office is 
aimed against unknown persons at the moment. Ex-liaison man 
Steinmetz lives in an unknown place with a new identity.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of the German 
Government, the economic situation in Germany has "brightened up 
again." In western Germany, current data indicates that the 
economic recovery is strengthening, says the monthly report of 
the Economics Ministry for April, published in Bonn today. 
Furthermore, the upturn in the east German economy "broadened 
and strengthened considerably." 
  The labor market, however, is still suffering from the after 
effects of the recession and the consequences of substantial 
rationalization efforts by companies. The seasonal reduction in 
the unemployment figure for March, which fell below 4 million 
for the first time in months, was therefore smaller than usual. 
In western Germany the March unemployment rate stood at 8.5 
percent and in eastern Germany at 16.8 percent. At the same 
time, the ministry points out that unemployment is far from 
being exclusively a German problem. In all other European Union 
countries the unemployment rate is higher than in Germany, it 
notes. 
  The Economics Ministry bases its optimism about the economy 
on a survey carried out by the Munich-based Ifo Institute for 
Economic Research among 350 mainly large companies, which expect 
an average increase in production of 1.25 percent in 1994. 
Moreover, new orders in industry and in the construction sector 
increased noticeably at the beginning of the year. The retail 
trade sector also registered a slight increase in turnover. 
Production in eastern Germany will even "expand strongly," the 
ministry said. At the start of the year orders in east 
Germany's industrial sector were almost 15 percent up on the 
previous year's level. Production was 16 percent higher than 
the previous year's level. Orders in the construction industry 
were up 29 percent. 
  According to the figures, inflation continues to ease. In 
western Germany the annual rate in March was 3.2 percent and in 
eastern Germany it was 3.5 percent.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Signs of a slight recovery in 
the German economy have apparently increased. The economic 
report of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), 
published on Wednesday [20 April], says that in western Germany 
the economic situation stabilized further at the beginning of 
1994. Despite "positive indicators of an end to the recession" 
there are still only limited chances of a powerful recovery. 
The signs of improved competitiveness and a strengthening of 
export demand cannot "distract from the fundamental problems of 
the continuing weakness in domestic demand." 
  Growth has accelerated in the former East Germany, according 
to the BDI. Nevertheless, east German industry can only keep 
pace in certain sectors, in spite of considerable progress in 
international competition. [passage omitted] 
  Economic Affairs Minister Guenter Rexrodt and Horst Siebert, 
a member of the Council of Experts for the Assessment of Overall 
Economic Development, spoke on Wednesday of an economic 
recovery. At the same time, speaking in Duesseldorf, Rexrodt 
stressed that this "turn for the better" does not mean, however, 
that there can be any let-up in striving for more growth and 
employment. Siebert said on Saarland Radio that he expects the 
GDP to grow by 1 percent in 1994. However, there is no 
noticeable revival in private consumption. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["ari"-initialed report: "More Shadow Than Light Despite </F>
Progress"] 
  [Text] The restructuring of the east German economy has 
made further progress, yet the increasingly lighter picture 
still shows more shadow than light. This was emphasized by the 
German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), Berlin, and the 
Institute for World Economy (IfW), Kiel, in their 10th report on 
adjustment progress in eastern Germany. 
  The recent report, which was again elaborated with the 
cooperation of the Halle Economic Research Institute, focuses on 
the manufacturing industry in eastern Germany, for which 5,400 
industrial and trade enterprises were questioned in the winter 
of 1993/94. The institutes note that in 1993 the situation of 
the industry has for the first time improved again. Investments 
were having an increasing effect on production. There is hardly 
any industry with a decreasing production. The current order 
books suggest a sustained growth in production. 
  Yet, the developments were still lacking in width. Few 
industrial enterprises were managing to develop supraregional 
markets independently. Mainly as a result of the high wage 
costs, the enterprises were exposed to stiff competition, 
increasingly also from contenders in Central and East Europe. 
The recession in western Germany has made sales in the old 
laender more difficult, outstanding debts were increasing, and 
the pressure of competition from Western companies, whose offers 
do in many cases not even cover the costs, has increased. Yet, 
some sales problems were also the result of oversupply in the 
new laender (bakeries, butcher's shops, industrial enterprises 
related to the construction sector, car repair shops). 
  Now as then, almost 70 percent of all industrial enterprises 
complain about the high pace of wage increases. The institutes 
have therefore not been surprised at the results of the survey, 
where wages in 35 percent of industrial enterprises and 32 
percent of trade enterprises were below the agreed minimum pay. 
Altogether, the unit labor costs were still some 40 percent 
above the western level, and enterprises were still making 
losses because the total amount of money paid to wage or salary 
earners was higher than the national income. Considering the 
expected wage increase of almost 10 percent in 1994 -- after 
almost 15 percent in 1993, the situation will hardly change for 
the time being. Thus, the pressure on enterprises to streamline 
their firms remains high, and no easing of the tense labor 
market can be expected. 
  In this situation it is not easy for enterprises to mobilize 
capital for investments, particularly since, in many cases, they 
still had to pay back old debts and are often unable to offer 
any security. In the case of newly founded enterprises and 
small businesses this was considerably slowing down expansion. 
  At the same time, the institutes expressed their 
understanding for the careful position of the banks. 
Possibilities for improvements are obviously seen regarding 
public investment subsidies, which are not sufficiently tailored 
to the needs of enterprises and can often be obtained only with 
great difficulty or arrive too late. 
  Investments in the manufacturing industry in eastern Germany 
were up more than 10 percent in 1993, while for 1993 the growth 
rate is expected to slow down slightly. In 1993, investment per 
employee in industrial enterprises was DM28,700, or almost 
DM4,000 more than in 1992. In the sphere of trade it was 
DM18,100, after DM20,500 in the previous year. Investment per 
employee was lowest in Trust Agency enterprises (DM16,500), 
while it was highest in companies belonging to west German or 
foreign enterprises (DM47,000). One in 10 enterprises were not 
planning any investment at all in 1994, while just under 
one-third of industrial enterprises and two-fifths of trade 
enterprises had not yet made a final decision. 
  As far as jobs are concerned, the number is expected to 
increase by some 6 percent in the sphere of trade. Yet, this is 
not sufficient to offset the planned job cuts in the industry of 
5 percent. On the other hand, it was mainly trade enterprises 
that complained most about the shortage of skilled labor. 
  The report takes a critical view of the issue of industrial 
cores. The institutes complain that the definition was not 
clear. In their view, the old industrial centers in eastern 
Germany should not be considered as cores but as shells. Their 
revitalization could be successful only where a new, fertile 
seed was implanted. DIW and IfW are worried that the means badly 
needed to develop productive areas might be directed toward 
unproductive areas. They conclude their report by warning that 
without belittling the success of putting enterprises on a sound 
footing again, high subsidies cannot be a guarantor of success.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dieter Teichmann, DIW Tax Expert, by W. </F>
Jakobs; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Jakobs] Herr Teichmann, according to your 
professional colleague Ruediger Pohl of the Haller Institute for 
Economic Research, the supplementary tax being demanded by the 
SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] will have a "harmful 
effect on the economy." A tax such as this would drive investors 
out of Germany--is this a serious assessment or is it 
scaremongering? 
  [Teichmann] Whether or not this is scaremongering, I cannot 
judge. I do not believe that the will to achieve would be 
decisively weakened by a supplementary tax of 10 percent, which, 
because of the tax increase being planned by the government for 
those in the higher income brackets, would actually lead to an 
increased tax burden of only 2.5 percent. This same weakening 
would also have to result from the 7.5 percent solidarity 
contribution that has been decided upon by the government. 
  [Jakobs] You do not fear an economically counterproductive 
overtaxing of the so-called achievement sustainers? 
  [Teichmann] One must consider that a three-tiered 
(1986/88/90) major tax reform has taken place. It was especially 
those in the medium and upper income brackets who profited from 
this tax reduction program. For a single person with a yearly 
income of 50,000 German marks [DM], the maximum tax rate went 
down by 16 percentage points as a result. With the surcharge 
being discussed now, persons in this income group would lose 
only a small portion of what they gained through the tax 
reductions of the past. Compared to the plans of the government, 
the SPD proposal would equate in this income group to an 
increased burden of DM27 per month. Circa 85 percent of those 
paying taxes would pay no surcharge at all in the event the SPD 
plans were implemented. 
  [Jakobs] The government wants to place the tax burden on 
all, 
the SPD only on those with gross incomes of more than DM60,000 
or DM120,000 [single or married taxpayers]. Which of these 
would be more appropriate for the promotion of the economy? 
  [Teichmann] The SPD plans would be better suited to 
strengthen the economic situation, since the 
consumption-intensive lower incomes would not be burdened, in 
contrast to the proposal of the government. In the upper income 
bracket, on the other hand, the savings quota would be higher. 
  [Jakobs] Former Munich Lord Mayor Georg Kronawitter (SPD) 
has 
made a plea for placing a greater tax burden on the enormous 
"unearned capital gains" being realized by owners of real 
estate. Would that be a practicable course to take, and how much 
revenue would it generate? 
  [Teichmann] In view of the public financial need, I view the 
greater taxation of such assets as appropriate and just. 
Especially if one takes into consideration the fact that the 
standard values serving as the basis for taxation have been set 
far too low. A doubling of the standard values, for example, 
would lead to two-digit billion [DM] increases in wealth and 
property tax payments.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe commentary: "Those Who Fail Against Serbia..."] </F>
  [Text] In 1936 the League of Nations, the world's greatest 
hope after the slaughter of peoples in World War I, committed 
suicide. In a fatal way, the cause of the suicide resembles the 
failure of the United Nations and the superpowers in Bosnia. In 
October 1935, Mussolini's Italy invaded Abyssinia and a few days 
later the League of Nations put its spluttering machinery of 
sanctions into operation. Oil in particular was not on the 
list; Nazi Germany supplied large amounts of war materiel; under 
cover of official indignation, England and France virtually gave 
the Italians a free hand because they hoped to win Rome for an 
anti-Hitler alliance. In May 1936, after a cruel war, Abyssinia 
no longer existed and the League of Nations was in a coma from 
which it was never to wake up. 
  Since April 1994, its successor, the United Nations, has 
gone 
off the rails in the same way and is heading straight for 
disaster. Gone are the days of the post-postwar era 
(approximately 1990-94), the times of high hopes and good 
intentions, where world powers, more or less in harmony, aimed 
at a world order where the violation of peace and genocide had 
to be prevented. This worked in the case of Saddam Husayn, but 
not in Somalia and Haiti, and even less in Sudan, the CNN-less 
and thus forgotten war. 
  So far, at least good intentions, accompanied by endless 
diplomatic interferences, the employment of latent military 
power in the form of 14,000 blue helmets, and even the 
half-hearted use of real force in the form of a handful of 
bombs, have been valid in Bosnia. And now that the Serbs have 
softened up Gorazde and can take it anytime? In view of the 
"catastrophe" (UN General Rose), it is not only the humanitarian 
impulse that fails, but also mere vanity, which normally plays 
the stronger part in the lives of people and nations. 
  After all, the Serbs staged the greatest of all provocations 
in Gorazde. With their hypocritical cease-fire promises, they 
fooled UN chief civilian officer Akashi twice. They took blue 
helmets hostage and attacked the Britons on land and in the air. 
They brought a UN protection zone under area fire -- which not 
even Saddam dared to do in northern Iraq. And finally they even 
duped the Russians, that is, their halfwilling protecting power, 
who are risking their relations with the West for the benefit of 
a wild rabble of soldiers and their masterminds in Belgrade. 
  Let us hear what excessively smooth mediator Vitaliy Churkin 
meanwhile has to say about the Serbian friends: "It is high 
time for Russia to break off the talks with the Bosnian Serbs. 
Moscow has to decide whether it may permit a group of 
extremists to rope in Great Russia for its objectives. Our 
answer is clear: Never." 
  And what about Bill Clinton, the successor of Jimmy Carter 
in 
the art of "zigzags and flipflops?" Sometimes bombs are 
dropped, sometimes talks are held. Now Defense Secretary Perry 
holds forth: "We will not enter into the war to prevent that 
(the fall of Gorazde)," then Clinton's security adviser Lake 
threatens: One has to make it clear to the Serbs "that the 
costs of continued stubbornness are high." 
  However, the costs -- the Serbs have meanwhile learned this 
as did formerly the Italian fascists -- are not high at all. 
The reasons for it can be counted on the fingers of one hand. 
The United States is still trying to digest the disgraceful 
withdrawal from Somalia and to avoid a confrontation with the 
Russians. Hard national interests are neither at stake for 
Washington nor for London or Paris, and the Germans do not 
participate anyway in actions where politics requires the 
addition of bullets. 
  Solid interests -- do they really exist? They also did not 
seem to be at work in Abyssinia's case, but afterward it was 
shown that the Italian machine guns had mowed down more than 
only Abyssinian warriors with bows and arrows. The belief in 
the international institutions' power to maintain order was 
broken; all those who hoped to implement their objectives with 
sheer force were spurred on. The fact that Serbian imperialism 
is meanwhile raging within the European civilization makes the 
matter even worse. 
  The last chance has not yet been missed. Bill Clinton, 
former governor of Arkansas, can still live up to his 
responsibility as a great power, Washington and Moscow can still 
combine their joint interests against the Serbs, who present 
both of them as paper tigers. Well-measured, but decided force 
can still play an important part in the Balkan war -- not as a 
peacemaker per se, but as a handyman of diplomacy. For: Always 
when the Serbs felt the firm hand of the big ones, they 
yielded.... 
  And if not, what then? Then the United Nations can relapse 
again into its old role of a debating society, then NATO can 
limit itself to cleaning guns, and then the United States can 
prepare itself for the long farewell to power in Europe. Those 
who fail against a third-rate power like Serbia will neither 
show the courage nor the wisdom to face a more powerful 
challenger.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "A Study Group for Gorazde"] </F>
  [Text] This is the hour of truth in Bosnia, and the truth 
is that the time is up for the Muslims. The best proof of it is 
not provided by the 37 victims of Serbian shells on Sunday [17 
April] in Gorazde alone, but the suggestions by French Foreign 
Minister Juppe on the following day: The United States, the 
United Nations, the European Union [EU], and Russia should set 
up a study group for the sake of defining a joint position. In 
plain English: Everything remains the way it is. Juppe said 
literally: France is "neither for resignation nor for 
escalation." 
  Meanwhile, the Serbs are not planning a study group, but 
continue their attacks against the UN safe haven (!) of Gorazde 
with twice as much rage. The UNHCR has reported that a shell is 
hitting the city center every 20 seconds. After the collapse of 
the Muslim resistance, General Rose, the commander of the blue 
helmets, has spoken of a "catastrophe." And the Security 
Council in New York has expressed its "regret": about the 
obstruction and blockade of UN personnel. Of course, it also 
"condemned" the "escalating military activities" of the Serbs. 
  Who is to blame for these terrible events? The answer is 
simple: all those who had the possibility to act. The severest 
tactical mistake was made on Friday by Yasushi Akashi, the 
supreme UN civilian on location. Believing that the Serbs would 
keep their cease-fire pledge, he denied Gen. Rose the requested 
air support. On Saturday, Serbian tanks forced their way 
through Gorazde. On Sunday, Akashi was duped again: The Serbs 
again promised to withdraw, but again used the break to better 
prepare their attack. 
World history is not made by public servants, however. Akashi 
read the signs of the times very well, which had been indicating 
for days that his bosses in the United Nations -- the 
superpowers -- had stripped him of his power to act and sign on 
behalf of the firm. After the two half-hearted U.S. bomber 
attacks, America's determination was exhausted again: On 
Friday, Clinton made it known that one did not want to involve 
NATO "in this war to create advantages for one or the other 
side." This was the response to the supplication of the Muslims 
--and it was music to the ears of the Serbs. On Saturday, when 
they got away with shooting down a British Harrier and attacked 
a British post, the direction in which they were heading was 
clear: Gorazde. 
  And the Russians? Their dubious game -- one day a mediator, 
the other a water bearer -- is the most important background 
factor of the tragedy: The harsh words from Moscow have 
intimidated the West, which has not been very resolute to begin 
with, and encouraged the Serbs, who have reacted sensibly to any 
shift of force. Today, Russian mediator Churkin is "deeply 
disappointed." Never before have "so many (Serbian) promises 
been broken in such a short time." In view of their dual-track 
diplomacy, the sympathy with the Russians has to be limited. In 
the hour of truth, they and the West showed that the 
"international community" is nothing more but the sum total of 
conflicting interests.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Deputy Giuseppe Tatarella </F>
by Paola Motta; place and date not given: "I Am Not the Devil" 
-- first paragraph is L'INFORMAZIONE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- People are talking of him, a former MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] politician, as the first deputy prime 
minister. But he, Giuseppe Tatarella, is saying that he would 
prefer to remain in his job of lower house floor leader. 
[National Alliance Secretary] Fini, however, apparently does 
not agree. The two met yesterday afternoon. Tatarella admitted 
only that the decision "is coming about calmly." Adding 
ironically: "Who has the greater say in the matter, a secretary 
or a simple party member? The secretary, of course...." 
  [Motta] In short, you are not really enthusiastic about 
being 
deputy prime minister. 
  [Tatarella] The problem is that I have greatly enjoyed being 
the floor leader during a period in which people changed from 
discrimination against us to dialogue. According to Fini, I 
would be able to do something different inside the government 
and he maintains that this position offers an opportunity for 
better dialogue. 
  [Motta] Is it true that it is you who untied the knot on the 
question of the parliamentary houses by proposing [Senate 
speaker] Scognamiglio? 
  [Tatarella] Yes, it is true. We had to put together a short 
list. Everyone was silent, and I made this proposal. My 
reasoning was this: In Italy Scognamiglio represents liberal 
democratic thinking, lay thinking, while Pivetti [Chamber of 
Deputies speaker] represents the Catholic faction; two groups 
which are complementary in Italy's history. 
  [Motta] All sorts of assumptions are being made as to the 
list of possible ministers. For the National Alliance, the 
names which keep on appearing are Fisichella, Fiori, Tremaglia. 
Do they have a chance? 
  [Tatarella] The chance exists. I would be happy if 
Fisichella were to get a ministry. I believe that it is right 
and high time to ask for a minister of emigration, in particular 
following the very tormented ride that we had with votes for 
Italians abroad. Tremaglia's name appears appropriate to me 
because one immediately thinks of him when considering the issue 
of votes for Italians abroad and vice versa. 
  [Motta] Do you believe that Article 92 of the Constitution, 
which places the choice of ministers at the discretion of the 
prime minister, will be applied this time? 
  [Tatarella] Yes, the choice should lie solely with the prime 
minister, and hence with Berlusconi. I think that someone as 
intuitive as he is will certainly have understood that a 
government cannot be formed just from one party and that this is 
a key demand expressed by citizens. 
  [Motta] Whom would you like to see as interior minister? 
  [Tatarella] People are talking of [anti-Mafia Judge] Di 
Pietro and this suggestion makes me particularly happy. But 
they say that the judge is unwilling to accept. Di Pietro, who 
has been one of the "founding fathers" of this new stage in the 
country's history, ought to understand this not so much an 
opportunity to be the minister of this or that, but an 
invitation to take part directly in the building of the Second 
Republic. If I were Di Pietro and I were asked, I would reply: 
For the sake of the news media I would say no, for the sake of 
history I would say yes. 
  [Motta] What do you think about the polemics which have 
burst 
out about 25 April [Liberation Day]. 
  [Tatarella] I do not support the instrumentalist thesis, as 
this has already been put forward by individuals who are not 
from the Right, and who are therefore more credible, in terms of 
objectivity, than I am. From my side, I would have betted high 
and organized a debate between De Felice, Bobbio, and Foa for an 
analysis of the Right-Left alternation as it features in this 
country's history. Today the problem is historical and the 
debate must be led by those who historically have something to 
say. 
  [Motta] What do you say to those who fear the presence of 
former MSI people in the government? 
  [Tatarella] They ought to reflect on our behavior. Our 
secretary is asking nothing for himself, and the floor leader 
would like to remain the floor leader. We are a party which, 
even if invited, has not put forward candidates for the 
parliamentary speaker positions, or for the Interior or Foreign 
Ministries. A party which, in short, has proven its ability to 
choose the line of cohabitation and compatibility, not creating 
problems for anyone. This line is the best possible guarantee. 
  [Motta] Their fears are therefore unfounded. 
  [Tatarella] Fears are of two types only: those of people who 
have an interest in these fears existing, and objective fears. 
To the first I will reply nothing because, even if I were to 
become Pope Innocent III, they would still say that I was the 
devil. With regard to the founded fears I say: If we make a 
mess of things, our credibility ends, and they will have every 
right to ask us to step aside. If, on the other hand, we do not 
make mistakes, it is their duty to admit publicly that their 
fear has been unwarranted. 
  [Motta] If you remain the National Alliance's floor leader, 
what will you do? 
  [Tatarella] My battle will be to convince the progressives 
that the majority-opposition concept no longer exists in the 
majority system and in the system of having one side or the 
other in government. Opposition is control, one force governs, 
the other controls. And those who control can become the 
controlled. 
  [Motta] Will the Left be in a position to control? 
  [Tatarella] With all the spectacle of divisions which they 
are giving, I think that they will not succeed all that easily. 
On the other hand, the history of the Left in Italy is that of 
splits. The concept of government was born with the Right, 
which was the first to govern. When the Left came to govern 
under Depretis [19th century], transformism was born. The Left 
was born of transformism and splits, this is the truth. It is 
its hidden weakness.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alberto Michelini, Italian Segni Pact </F>
Deputy, by Marco Politi; place and date not given: "Michelini: 
`Think About the Family'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Politi] So, Mr. 
Michelini, if [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi were to call you 
tomorrow to offer you the post of minister for the family, would 
you refuse it? 
  [Michelini] Such a decision would have to be agreed upon 
within the context of the Pact, of which I am a member. It 
cannot be a personal matter or something done in a hurry. On 
what conditions might I join the government? This is a question 
that concerns the entire Pact and the Center. 
  [Politi] And what are those conditions? 
  [Michelini] Antimonopoly legislation, the antifascist issue, 
a genuine federalism, and a policy on the family. Be that as it 
may, at present I see no possibility of any comprehensive 
connection with the government. 
  [Politi] Nevertheless, Berlusconi strongly believes in such 
a 
ministry. With what do you think it should deal? 
  [Michelini] It should be a center for coordinating and 
initiating family policies. In France it was a Socialist, 
Mitterrand, who decided to establish such a ministry, and in 
Germany it was the Social Democrats. There is nothing new to 
invent. Let us look at the other examples in Europe; we need to 
gather together forms of expertise that are at present 
dispersed. The Health Ministry deals with elderly people, the 
Interior Ministry deals with young people, the Foreign Ministry 
deals with some forms of adoption, and the Labor and Finance 
Ministries are also involved. Instead, everything should be 
coordinated. 
  [Politi] What are the priorities? 
  [Michelini] Jobs for young people, with tax relief on first 
jobs, the definition of part-time work status for men and women, 
housing for young couples, health and pension benefits for 
housewives, and tax policy, which must take account of all 
members of the family. These issues must be tackled at last, 
because the family is a common asset, irrespective of 
ideologies. Let us not forget that many people voted for 
Berlusconi because he, at last, talked about the family. 
  [Politi] And so we come back to Berlusconi. The future prime 
minister has announced that he wants an alliance with the 
Center. With which of you has he initiated contacts? 
  [Michelini] Neither with me nor with Segni's Pact. Of 
course, both within the Pact and within the Italian Popular 
Party [PPI] there are members well disposed toward such an 
approach. 
  [Politi] Who are they? 
  [Michelini] Within the PPI, the Formigoni-Buttiglione group; 
within the Pact, apart from myself, there are Tremonti, the 
economist; professor Siciliani; Judge Stajano; and Milio, the 
attorney. We are five out of 13. Another two or three might 
join us. This position must be taken into account. Tomorrow we 
Pact members of parliament will have a meeting with rank and 
file members at the Metropol Hotel, and we will discuss this. 
Furthermore, I have already told Segni directly: "Mario," I 
said, "now that La Malfa and Amato are shifting to the Left, 
what will we do?" 
  [Politi] What was Segni's reply? 
  [Michelini] We are of the Center-Right, we are liberal 
democrats, but we are closed to Berlusconi and Berlusconism. 
  [Politi] But you consider that a mistake. 
  [Michelini] I told Segni that we cannot remain closed. If 
Berlusconi puts forward acceptable arguments, he must be brought 
toward the Center. No comprehensive accord is necessary, but 
certainly the Right must be encouraged to become the Center that 
[LA VOCE editor] Montanelli would like. In other words, if he 
puts forward a program that is not unacceptable, I will not vote 
against it but will abstain. That is, I do not accept a 
fundamental rejection of Berlusconi, and neither do the Italian 
people accept such an attitude. 
  [Politi] What does the Church hierarchy think? Have you met 
with Cardinal Ruini? 
  [Michelini] I will be meeting with him this week. I want to 
hear his opinion concerning issues that are of close concern to 
the Church. This, because it is the first time that an 
opportunity has arisen to implement the Catholic social 
doctrine. It has never happened before: The DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] never did anything about it, using the excuse 
of its nonconfessional allies; and I am talking about issues 
such as education, the family, solidarity, and the protection of 
life from birth to death. 
  [Politi] Does the Vatican share that opinion? 
  [Michelini] The Vatican is waiting to see how the situation 
turns out. The crucial date will be in July, at the PPI 
congress. If Buttiglione is not elected secretary, a split is 
inevitable. Buttiglione is the most faithful interpreter into 
political terms of the Church's social doctrine.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Democratic Alliance `Divorces' </F>
From Progressives"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- The "merry war machine" is continuing to 
lose its components. Less than three weeks after the elections, 
and following the separation announced by Communist Renewal and 
the PSI [Italian Socialist Party], now also AD [Democratic 
Alliance] is bidding farewell, hopping down from the progressive 
train, in such tones as to call into question the very 
possibility of a federative agreement. 
  A hectic day of contact-making and meetings seems to have 
paved the way in the Chamber of Deputies for the birth of a 
foursome, including the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], 
Rete, the Greens, and the social Christians, as well as for the 
probable convergence of AD's 12 deputies into the mixed group, 
together with the South Tyrol People's Party and Valdostan Union 
members -- assuming, of course, that the storm through which 
[Pact for Italy leader] Segni's former allies are going (since 
yesterday they have also had to cope with spokesperson 
Ferdinando Adornato's resignation, offered in a long letter 
addressed to AD's leaders) is not the prelude to a major 
disbandment. 
  This is the outcome of a tug of war which has occupied the 
progressive front leaders for the past four days. A political 
tug of war which, against the background of a yet unanswered 
"What next?" and of a compelling grassroots thrust toward unity, 
was also fueled by other factors: personal ambitions, unavowed 
"logistical" concerns, and, above all, the tensions to which the 
electoral defeat has given rise among the left-wing political 
forces. It is first and foremost, the war of nerves currently 
raging at Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] between [PDS 
Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema in view 
of a congress scheduled for the fall and which -- as grudgingly 
acknowledged at PDS headquarters, where the leadership will be 
meeting today -- will certainly not be a "ritual" one. 
  All this explains the succession of moves and countermoves, 
interspersed with crossed vetoes, feints, and double-crossing, 
which has ended by leaving in AD's hands the hot potato of an 
embarrassing split. After D'Alema "forcefully" shipwrecked the 
federative option last week, it has become difficult for 
Adornato to counter the thrust of AD's republican component, 
which is absolutely determined to break away from the PDS's 
"hegemony" and secure independent connections with Segni and 
[former Italian Popular Party Secretary] Martinazzoli. In the 
Senate, Bruno Visentini immediately started working on the 
possibility of setting up an autonomous group of Democrats for 
Europe. This would be open to senators for life such as De 
Martino, Bobbio, and Valiani. In the Chamber of Deputies, the 
same concern first led to a "no" to D'Alema and then gave 
[former lower house speaker] Napolitano the cold shoulder and 
suggested, at the same time, Giorgio Bogi as the possible 
progressive group floor leader. 
  Last Saturday morning [16 April], playing on the novelty of 
a 
(strictly speaking) nonparty personality, D'Alema wheeled out 
Luigi Berlinguer onto the track. It was the Greens, however, 
who got AD out of an embarrassing situation by counterpoising 
Anna Finocchiaro to Siena university's former rector. This was 
a way of breaking off and saving face, given the split at the 
top of the environmentalist federation, with those against 
forming a single group prevailing by seven votes against four, 
and the quasi-certainty that -- thanks partly to less stringent 
rules -- the environmentalists will organize on their own at 
Palazzo Madama [Senate]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "High Fidelity Government"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- "There are no legal constraints, no 
obligations: The under secretary for the Prime Minister's Office 
does not have to be a member of parliament." Yesterday the 
constitutionalists consulted by [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi 
gave the go-ahead: If he so desires, Gianni Letta can follow him 
to the Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's seat]. Such a role seems 
ideally suited to Berlusconi's top adviser, the man who 
virtually taught him politics and who followed and held meetings 
with all national leaders. Berlusconi wants him at all costs: 
He trusts Letta, knows his working timetable (every day from 
0800 hours until late in the evening, skipping breakfast in 
order to make telephone calls) and his total commitment. Letta 
will work at the Prime Minister's Office together with spokesman 
Antonio Tajani. They will be flanked by two deputy leaders -- 
the National Alliance's Giuseppe Tatarella and the League's 
Roberto Maroni. However, it is not yet clear whether the League 
will be satisfied with responsibility for the secret services 
and federalism: It is possible that Maroni (like Claudio 
Martelli before him) will demand and secure a prominent ministry 
for himself. 
  It will be a three-headed government, a government led by a 
businessman who has already revealed his allergy to the slow 
pace of bureaucracy. A government whose absolute priority is to 
get rid of all previous ministers and to reshuffle hundreds of 
bureaucrats and officials, perhaps as many as a thousand. 
Assuming it goes ahead, this operation will require a task 
force, a front firing line to deal with the many difficulties, 
the innumerable traps that exist in the Rome administration. 
Forza Italia's leader is pondering all this, very anxious about 
having to use so many newcomers. For instance, he wants to give 
further thought to his choice of parliamentary group leaders. 
Until the government is formed, Cesare Previti will lead the 
Senate group, while it has been decided to appoint a temporary 
leader to the lower house for a three-month trial period, after 
which a final decision will be reached. Two names are being 
mentioned -- Vittorio Dotti, the attorney (though he may be 
given a government post) and Pietro Di Muccio. The latter has 
been a senior Senate official and is well acquainted with 
parliamentary rules. Berlusconi's dream is to appoint his two 
lawyers to two very prominent posts -- Previti to the Interior 
Ministry and Dotti to the Justice Ministry. However, the 
National Alliance seems unenthusiastic and has ruled out the 
granting of both the Interior and the Justice Ministries to the 
same party. 
  Forza Italia also plans to assign a key role to political 
scientist Giuliano Urbani, maybe the Ministry for Relations with 
Parliament and Institutional Reforms (merging two portfolios), 
though this post could also go to Francesco D'Onofrio (who is 
also in the running, albeit unenthusiastically, for one of the 
four deputy speakerships of the lower house). But Berlusconi's 
secret trump card is the creation of an economic superministry, 
by merging the Treasury and Budget Ministries, a position made 
to measure for Lamberto Dini, Director General of the Bank of 
Italy. Failing any last-minute surprises, the Foreign Ministry 
will go to Antonio Martino (Giovanni Spadolini is unlikely to be 
brought back). One strange fact emerging from remarks by all 
four representatives of the pole for freedom is that there is 
one post in the next government that nobody wants -- the Labor 
Ministry. To meet the promise to find a million new jobs is 
something that frightens even the "newcomers." We shall see who 
comes forward. 
  The former Christian democrats of the CCD [Christian 
Democratic Center] have set their sights on two important 
ministries: the Defense Ministry for Clemente Mastella, who was 
under secretary for four years, and the Ministry of Posts for 
Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli. Gianfranco Fini, however, having 
secured the deputy premiership for his trusted Tatarella, will 
put forward Publio Fiori for the Health Ministry and Domenico 
Fisichella for the Education Ministry. The League would like to 
appoint Deputy for Brescia Vito Gnutti to the Industry Ministry 
and Giancarlo Pagliarini to the Finance Ministry. (The latter 
has said: "I will go where I can do a job that I know how to do 
-- accounting.") But the Finance Ministry could also be given 
to a Pact member such as Giulio Tremonti if negotiations between 
the prospective premier and the Popular Party prove successful. 
No decision has yet been reached on the Family Ministry; until 
yesterday the candidates were Alberto Michelini and Roberto 
Formigoni, though it could also go to someone outside parliament 
if, as seems likely, the Popular Party defers a decision until 
after its congress. Though Vittorio Sgarbi is rumored to have 
put himself forward for the Cultural Heritage Ministry, it is 
not yet clear what role will be played by Liberals Alfredo 
Biondi and Raffaele Costa. Some would like to appoint Costa 
deputy lower house speaker, together with the National 
Alliance's Adriana Poli Bortone (who is already assured of the 
post), while others take it for granted that Biondi will be 
appointed chairman of the lower house Foreign Affairs Committee. 
The pole has made official its nominations for the two deputy 
speakerships of the Senate: the National Alliance's Romano 
Misserville and the League's Marcello Staglieno. The lower 
house and the Senate will have two deputy speakers chosen by the 
opposition, by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the 
Popular Party, respectively. All elections in parliament have 
been deferred until 21 April, while the race for the committee 
begins at 1600 hours today, and of course those excluded from 
this first round can still hope for a ministerial post.

<F P=106> [Article by Chiara Valentini: "God, Country, and Santoro"] </F>
  [Text] He started on [TV program] Rosso e Nero. He 
impressed Curzi. And today, Costanzo says that he was the 
electoral campaign's best communicator. Here are the secrets of 
a neofascist former bureaucrat, who has become a star in the 
world of politics. 
  Before the elections, Montanelli, to whom the Right is 
certainly no mystery, maintained that in the so-called Freedom 
Alliance "three leaders are in the arena, each of them a `duce,' 
and we don't know which of them will be the first to climb to 
the balcony of Palazzo Venezia." As of now, it can already be 
said that (in addition, obviously, to poor Bossi) Gianfranco 
Fini will not be the one to set forth on that endeavor. The fact 
remains, however, that this Bolognese with the demeanor of an 
affable young man, a glib tongue, and his awful neckties, is one 
of the winners of the most recent elections. At any rate, Fini 
succeeded in knocking down the last barriers of the apartheid 
that was still excluding him from full participation, and in 
gaining recognition as one of the future protagonists of the 
so-called Second Republic. 
  Not a small feat for a public figure who, less than six 
months ago, confronting Francesco Rutelli in the second round of 
the voting for mayor of Rome, was defeated, although very 
narrowly, by a multiparty coalition held together mainly by the 
idea that a neofascist must not become the capital's first 
citizen. 
  Since then, light years have seemingly gone by. During the 
final round of a frenzied electoral campaign, Giorgio 
Almirante's godson, who in his first press conference as 
secretary of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] stated: 
"Mussolini remains my mentor," was able to gain the support of 
tens of thousands of sympathizers, filling squares that up to 
then had been inaccessible to members of the MSI, such as 
Milan's Piazza Duomo and Bologna's Piazza Maggiore. He flooded 
the leading daily newspapers with hundreds of interviews; but 
above all, on TV, he walked away with the game. 
  More reassuring than Bossi, more capable of appealing to 
reason than Berlusconi, "a true leader for the new Italian 
Right," as Michele Santoro puts it, Fini's star was born within 
the confines of the TV screen. In trying to understand the 
reasons for the rise of a man not endowed with too many 
qualities, such as Fini, the normal parameters of politics are 
not of very much help. Fini's biography reveals--more than an 
outstanding personality, charisma, or a rich store of dynamic 
ideas--a marked ability to tail behind the winning horse and 
remain in the background, helped by a generous measure of luck. 
His catapult into politics demonstrates this. It was 1976, when, 
having arrived in Rome at age 18 from his birthplace, Bologna, 
this lanky youth, a Fronte della Gioventu [Youth Front] 
little-known militant in the shadow of its secretary Massimo 
Anderson, rose, from one day to the next, to take the 
secretary's place. It was neither a plot nor a dazzling ascent. 
It was simply the consequence of Fini's having remained 
practically alone. Anderson, together with almost all the young 
leaders, had gone over, lock, stock, and barrel, to join the 
Democrazia Nazionale [National Democracy] secessionists. Only 
the young people of the Front's left wing, led by Almirante's 
opponent Rauti, stayed. Fini inevitably, therefore, became the 
candidate, even though his popularity among the neofascist youth 
was very scant, because they considered him a bureaucrat. In 
fact, in the elections, Fini finished only fifth. 
  Historian Marco Tarchi, an ardent Rauti follower who later 
left the MSI, finished first in that election, and recalls: 
"Fini shouldered the blow very well, and came to congratulate 
me. `There is no need,' I said to him, `I am convinced that 
Almirante will actually choose you.' Fini replied: `That is 
completely out of the question. I have my dignity.' Two days 
later, he was secretary of the Front." 
  Whenever the Fini story has been told, it has always been 
mentioned, together with a wealth of details, that the 
protection accorded him by Almirante's influential wife, Assunta 
de Medici, heavily favored a career that would lead him to first 
become Almirante's heir apparent and later, in 1987, his 
successor. It was rumored that "donna" Assunta's fondness for 
Fini was not unrelated to her hope of marrying off her daughter 
Giuliana to such a respectable young lad. What instead has not 
been told in great detail is what happened with Fini's wife 
Daniela Di Sotto, the first neofascist first lady to have been 
accredited by Italy's republican history. During the campaign 
for the Rome mayoral elections, Daniela Fini referred to her 
past as an ardent MSI militant in the turbulent section of Via 
Noto in Rome, and to a previous marriage. "In 1980, I separated. 
The year after, I went to live with Gianfranco. In 1985 Giuliana 
was born," she recounted somewhat vaguely 
  The reality is a little more complicated, and in the course 
of the last two electoral campaigns the personal side of the 
story of the rightist leader was used at times as a political 
weapon to cast doubt on Fini, defender of the family to the 
bitter end, and a devout Catholic (this was one of his strong 
arguments during the most recent electoral campaign). As a 
matter of fact, Daniela's first husband, Sergio Mariani, an 
extremist who had had some trouble with the law, had been one of 
Fini's closest comrades, indeed his deputy in the Youth Front. 
The story between Mariani's wife Daniela and his boss Gianfranco 
had generated a good deal of gossip. On 10 March 1980, a brief 
ANSA [National Associated Press Agency] communique announced 
that on that day Sergio Mariani "had attempted suicide in his 
home on Via Valsesia, in the presence of his wife Daniela Di 
Sotto." Mariani himself, who later left the limelight and today 
manages a printing office near the MSI headquarters, actually 
confirmed the hypothesis of an attempted suicide. In the closed 
world of neofascism, the rumor spread that Fini was also present 
when the first shot was fired. As for Daniela, having succeeded 
in obtaining a divorce, she married Fini in a civil ceremony in 
1988, left active politics, and chose, as she stated to LA 
STAMPA, "to be a wife and mother." 
  This not exactly edifying episode, on top of the mediocre 
management of Youth Front, nevertheless did not diminish 
Almirante's trust in his disciple. Maurizio Costanzo recalls 
that in 1985 the elderly leader, arriving for an appearance on 
his TV program "Buona Domenica" [Happy Sunday] had been 
accompanied by a lanky, quiet young man, none other than Fini. 
"He is tops," Almirante had said. "He is my heir apparent. Soon 
you will have to ask him to appear on TV." Those expectations 
became a reality, but also because of the significant 
contribution of another public figure who, after Almirante's 
death, and for completely different reasons, became Fini's 
second sponsor, Francesco Cossiga. 
  In his strategy, still partly obscure today, of pickax 
blows, 
of annihilation of the political system, Cossiga had also played 
the card of the rehabilitation of the only party not committed 
to the First Republic, the MSI. The first declaration on a grand 
scale in favor of a party that should no longer be discriminated 
against came during a trip Cossiga made to London. 
  Seizing the opportunity, Gianfranco Fini got in touch the 
following day, with, among others, Sandro Curzi, the popular 
director of Italian TV's Channel 3 newscast, G-3. Curzi recalls: 
"He asked me to meet with him to talk about the past and the 
future, to sound out my ideas. He immediately came across to me 
as a knowledgeable public figure, made for TV." Michele Santoro 
also became aware of Fini's TV potential, and called on him with 
increasing frequency to take part in his broadcasts. "At first," 
says Santoro, "we called on him mainly because he was an 
excellent intermediary to Cossiga, who at that time was a 
subject of much discussion. Fini seemed to be one of the few in 
a position to speak for him." 
  Like other TV anchormen, however, Santoro soon discovered 
that the MSI secretary was also a viable subject in his own 
right. "He grew with each show. He spoke clearly, and was good 
at making quips, outflanking the opponent, and intercepting him 
at just the right moment, without unleashing brawls," says 
Santoro. He adds, though, that he often detected an imbalance 
between the brilliance of his statements and the modesty of 
their content. "Especially during this electoral campaign, I saw 
Fini searching for an impossible balance between his formative 
culture, that is, the MSI Right, on the one hand, and the 
neolaissez-faire ideas borrowed from Berlusconi." 
  Ah yes, enter Silvio Berlusconi. None other than the third 
man to enter impetuously into Fini's life, in the midst of 
Fini's duel with Francesco Rutelli. Perhaps for the first time 
in his career, Fini had gambled. He had hoped to be able to give 
his votes, by now on the way out of their deep freeze, to a 
friendly candidate, Francesco Cossiga. But when he saw the 
moderates able to put forward only a lackluster prefect, Caruso, 
he entered personally into the fray. It was an extremely 
felicitous move, the first bench-test of the new right that 
today is on the rise. 
  The new Roman bourgeoisie quickly discovered that 
Sbardella's 
old DC [Christian Democratic Party] could be worthily replaced 
by these pliable, zealously enthusiastic comrades, and the 
neofascist drawing rooms like that of Princess Pallavicini gave 
them their all-out support. But more than anything else, it was 
Silvio Berlusconi's weighty dictum: "If I could vote in Rome, I 
would choose Fini," that achieved for the MSI secretary his 
accreditation. 
  As of that moment, our hero finds his third spiritual 
father. 
According to Gianni Baget Bozzo, "It was the start of the heroic 
epic of this eternal number two, to whom the destiny will 
perhaps assign the dissolving of his party into a Right that is 
still in its formative stage." With his habitual ease, Fini has 
sought in recent weeks to wed social content with laissez-faire, 
positing himself as the accredited "social conscience of the new 
alignment." He has battled with Bossi and has been defined by 
Berlusconi as "the loyal ally whose views we share almost in 
their entirety." According to Maurizio Costanzo, "He was this 
electoral campaign's best communicator." This opinion is shared 
by sociologist Renato Mannheimer: "He has contributed 
substantively to the relegitimizing of the Right, and in the 
process he has also gained the high personal regard of many of 
those who did not vote for him." 
  Amid this chorus of praise, however, the question that 
remains unanswered is: Who, really, today, is Gianfranco Fini. 
According to Santoro, "The problem of openness, in an 
image-driven society, is rather complicated. Positing himself 
far and wide as a democrat, Fini has at least performed an 
educational function toward his rank and file." Historian 
Luciano Canfora expresses an opposite view: "A complex body such 
as a political party cannot be changed by the waving of a magic 
wand. Whatever Fini's true intentions may be, it will take more 
than that to transform an apparatus, to permeate the conscience 
of its militants." In the midst of today's confusion, it does 
not seem easy to say he is wrong.

  The rightist National Alliance leader is pursuing an 
ideological high-wire balancing act. In the beginning, he warred 
against the majority rule system, then reaped its benefits. At 
one time, he eulogized Mussolini, then moderated his tones to 
tranquilize the moderate bourgeoisie. Over a period of a few 
years, Fini thought has performed a thousand, not always well 
defined, balancing acts. Here are a few examples. 
  The majority rule swindle: "The majority rule system is a 
swindle that enables those with few votes to occupy many 
parliamentary seats" (December 1992). 
  Eia, Eia, Alala!: [exultant chant used by Mussolini 
suuporters]. "Fascism was a great endeavor, in many respects 
unattained, to impart dignity to the nation. The important 
thing is for us to be always a step ahead of the times, as 
fascism taught us to be" (December 1987). "We shall try to 
realize our dream, by demonstrating that Fascism comprises 
highly valid elements for the Italian society" (December 1987). 
"Fascism has a tradition of honesty, correctness, and good 
government" (September 1992). 
  History is to blame: "The French Revolution is to blame for 
having swept away the values of the Hellenistic-Roman world. 
Also to blame are luminarism, Marxism, hedonism, materialism, 
indeed all that measures the human being by what he or she has 
succeeded in owning, not in being" (July 1988). 
  Tedious companions: "Ciarrapico is a historic fascist friend 
of Almirante" (September 1992). 
  Europe? No, thanks: "Maastricht, for Italy, is a no-win 
situation. Like pitting the Lodigiani soccer team against the 
Milan" (September 1992). 
  Presidentialism? Yes, thanks: "We are at the point we were 
in 
1946. If after 20 years of fascism the Italians were asked to 
choose between a monarchy and a republic, why can this not be 
done after 40 years of democracy? Why not ask the Italians now 
if they want a presidential system?" 
  Longing for Le Pen: "He is 10 years ahead of his time. He is 
a sanguine, generous man in love with life. On 8 January at 
Nice, he dove into the sea as parachutists rained down from the 
cloud-laden sky" (April 1988). 
  The Enemy, Bossi: "He is an ex-dance-hall singer. He is the 
other face of partyocracy. He defends only those with a full 
stomach" (October 1992). "I am convinced that Bossi's talk of 
federalism hides a real secession-mindedness" (September 1992). 
"Bossi is a crony of De Mita and Gava" (July 1992). "Bossi is an 
irresponsible big mouth and is selling his constituents down the 
river" (September 1992). 
  Blows: "I have given some and I have taken some" (September 
1987). 
  The Roman salute: "Like the Roman salute and the black 
shirt, 
fascism's entire liturgical and exterior world is no longer 
valid" (December 1987). "The Roman salute does not scandalize 
me. On the contrary, at a time when everyone is vying with 
everyone else to water down his identity or is ashamed of it, 
there are those who are proud of it" (October 1992). 
  The death penalty: "As for the death penalty, I would not 
make a banner issue of it" (September 1987). "I am for the death 
penalty for heinous crimes and in the case of absolute certainty 
of guilt" (September 1992). "If the perpetrator of the bombing 
of the Bologna train station were discovered I would condemn him 
or her to death" (September 1992). "I am not for the death 
penalty" (March 1994). 
  Italian Istria: "We shall wage a determined battle for the 
return of Istria to Italy" (August 1991). "I shall ask Cossiga 
for a review of the Peace Treaty and the Osimo Treaty. Italy 
cannot renounce its right to the very Italian Istria" (August 
1991). 
  Mussolini: "An example of love for his land and love for his 
people" (August 1987). "The century's greatest statesman" 
(October 1992). "It is thanks to Benito Mussolini that in 1922 
Italy did not turn communist" (January 1992). "If Mussolini were 
alive today, he would guarantee the freedom of the Italians." 
"Along with the names of Cavour, Mazzini, and Garibaldi, that of 
Mussolini will also be given to squares and monuments" (October 
1992). 
  Cossiga as leader: "I shall place Cossiga at the head of the 
`rally' we are putting together" (August 1992). 
  Shaven heads: "An ex-member of the MSI could well be among 
the Nazi skinheads" (November 1992). "I hope all shaven heads 
are not criminalized, including Gianluca Vialli's. The Nazi 
skinheads are not dangerous. Furthermore, in a democracy, even 
the most aberrant ideas must be countered by firm beliefs, not 
laws" (September 1992).

  [Text] Foreign Minister Durao Barroso has called on the 
different sides in the Bosnian conflict to negotiate. Portugal 
backs a diplomatic, not military, solution in Bosnia. Maria Rui 
reports: 
  [Rui] Bosnia-Herzegovina was an inevitable topic for the 
talks between the Portuguese foreign minister and his Slovene 
counterpart. Durao Barroso received his Slovene counterpart this 
morning and they signed a protocol providing for the lifting of 
visa requirements. Slovenia is the only republic of former 
Yugoslavia which has managed to establish a democracy, said 
Durao Barroso. On the subject of Bosnia, he told Renascenca 
that Portugal advocated the search for a political agreement. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] We continue to believe that the 
main thing is to search for a political accord, via political 
means. We said it very clearly two days ago at the General 
Affairs [European Union ministerial] meeting in Luxembourg. 
For us it is clear that responsibility for the situation lies 
mainly with the Serbs. The Serbs have in fact surpassed certain 
limits. It is important for NATO, in supporting the UN 
resolutions and within the framework of the legitimacy of the 
UN, to show the Serbs clearly that this type of behavior cannot 
be tolerated. [end recording] 
  [Rui] As for the Bosnian prime minister's statement today 
that the international community has condemned the Muslims to 
death, Durao Barroso said: 
  [Begin Barroso recording] The international community has 
condemned no one to death. The international community is doing 
what it can. The UN has been doing what it can. In one or two 
cases, perhaps there may have been a failure in communications, 
a mistake in implementation. But it is totally wrong, when 
there is a conflict in a certain region, to say it is the fault 
of the rest of the world. [end recording] 
  [Rui] As for the situation in South Africa and the recent 
accord between Inkatha, the ANC, and President de Klerk, Durao 
Barroso is pleased. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] It is good; I am pleased. It is 
good news. When I was in South Africa recently I met everyone, 
I also spoke to Mr Buthelezi and, at the time, I urged him to 
participate in the elections. We believe that it is always a 
mistake not to be involved when it is a matter of the foundation 
of a regime or the transition to a new regime. Those who remain 
outside always lose, because in some way they exclude themselves 
from the legitimacy of the new regime. [end recording] 
  [Rui] Durao Barroso also said that the Portuguese want to 
stay in South Africa and that journalists have speculated much 
about their return.

  [Text] [Announcer] Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao 
Barroso spoke about Bosnia this morning. He said that the 
situation of the blue helmets is becoming unacceptable. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] None of the countries, or those 
where public opinion is, shall we say, more shocked by this 
situation, has so far advocated sending soldiers to the area to 
fight. One thing is troops to fight, another is blue helmets. 
The Blue Helmets -- many of them are almost hostages. They are 
witnessing massacres. Well, I ask myself whether it is very 
useful to have people witnessing massacres. Therefore, if we do 
not accept the possibility of massive military intervention, 
then we have to seek a political solution. [end recording] 
  Durao Barroso was speaking after a meeting with the Slovene 
foreign minister at Necessidades Palace [Foreign Ministry]. 
Durao Barroso also said that the success of the elections in 
South Africa could be a good start for the pacification of 
southern Africa. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] Contrary to a number of reports 
that have been made public which say the Portuguese Government's 
position is that the key to the issue lies in South Africa, I 
can say this is not true. There is a certain influence, but it 
would be an illusion to think that the Angolan problem will be 
resolved exclusively in South Africa, without denying, 
obviously, the links between the two situations. Of course, if 
the situation in South Africa evolves positively, with 
stability, with democracy, this can only be a positive factor 
for stability in the region, namely in Angola and Mozambique.

  [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is returning to Lisbon. 
In a few hours he will leave Hong Kong ending his visit to the 
Far East. He is pleased and said that this visit, involving 
business worth millions [of contos], was positive for Portugal 
and China. Marina Pimentel reports: 
  [Pimentel] Business deals worth over 100 billion escudos 
were 
signed with China or are close to being finalized. The figure 
was confirmed by the prime minister today. 
  [Begin Cavaco recording] Tens of millions, tens of millions 
contos [1,000 escudos]. If we add the contracts already signed 
to those contracts which could be signed as a result of 
declarations of intent, we will go over 100 million contos. [end 
recording] 
  [Pimentel] Cavaco said this figure surpassed all his 
expectations. He was speaking at a news conference in Hong 
Kong, convened mainly for the media of the territory, which like 
Macao is going through a transition period to Chinese 
administration. Cavaco was questioned mostly about the 
different stances between Portugal and Great Britain in their 
relations with China. Unlike the situation in Macao, the Hong 
Kong transition process is experiencing some tension -- mainly 
due to the hard stance which the current governor has taken 
regarding guarantees of democracy in the territory after 1997. 
Cavaco did not tire of repeating that Portugal is not 
experiencing similar problems, because things were sorted out in 
the Joint Declaration that Lisbon and Beijing signed in 1987. 
  Cavaco also reiterated what he has been saying throughout 
his 
visit: He does not like to discuss human rights in public, but 
that does not mean he did not discuss them with the Chinese 
authorities.

  [Text] Cavaco Silva is on his way back to Lisbon, having 
spent the last few hours of his 11-day Far East tour in Hong 
Kong. It was in Hong Kong that the prime minister quantified 
the economic results of the contacts established in China and 
Macao, specifically business deals worth over 100 million contos 
[1 conto equals 1,000 escudos]. 
  [Announcer] Cavaco Silva's meeting with the governor of Hong 
Kong was the last official act of the prime minister's 11-day 
visit to China. Cavaco is now on his way home, but while still 
in Hong Kong he made an appraisal of his trip and declared 
himself very pleased. The visit achieved all the objectives we 
set ourselves, the prime minister stated, and proceeded to 
justify his statement with the economic results: The 60 
Portuguese businessmen who travelled with the head of the 
government left China with 100 million contos' worth of 
contracts either signed or under negotiation, 25 millions 
corresponding to deals already guaranteed between Portuguese and 
Chinese companies, and the remainder still dependent on further 
talks. This represents a degree of Sino-Portuguese economic 
cooperation that has surpassed the best expectations of the 
Portuguese delegation.

  [Text] Tolerance by Prime Minister Cavaco Silva toward the 
Chinese political regime, without any reference to the human 
rights problem, has not been welcomed by President Soares. 
Mario Soares understands that Cavaco Silva may be concerned 
about Macao, but went on to say that, as far as omitting human 
rights violations is concerned, people should use silence to 
suit themselves. He made the above statements in an interview 
to Maria Joao Figueiredo: 
  [Begin recording] [Figueiredo] You have said that China has 
a 
dictatorship. Are you concerned about Macao and what may happen 
after 1999? 
  [Soares] No, I am not concerned about Macao, because I am 
convinced that the Chinese, whatever China's evolution may be -- 
and I believe there will be evolution in China, like everywhere 
else -- will be faithful to the Luso-Chinese joint declaration. 
As far as I am concerned, I am relatively tranquil about the 
future of Macao. 
  [Figueiredo] There are Portuguese politicians in China at 
this moment, and the human rights issue has not been mentioned. 
Do you have any reservations about human rights having been 
ignored? 
  [Soares] I understand the prime minister's logic. I 
understand that, when he was in China, he was essentially 
concerned about our relations with China and the future of a 
territory for which we have responsibility, namely Macao. I 
understand that he may want to defend the idea that we should 
have relations with China, not ignoring, nevertheless, the fact 
that the Chinese regime is obviously not a regime that is to our 
liking, because it is not a democracy, it is indeed a 
dictatorship. 
  [Figueiredo] Is then silence justified? 
  [Soares] No. Silence depends on circumstances, and everybody 
may use silence when they believe it must be used and also 
believe that it is the best way for their own country. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by N. Colli: "11,000 Young People Became Objectors </F>
in March"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch 
yesterday described the increase in conscientious objection 
applications over the past few months as "spectacular." 
Following his appearance in the Senate in order to explain the 
new Conscientious Objection Plan yesterday, Belloch quantified 
the considerable increase in objectors by announcing that during 
March a total of 11,000 young people swelled the lists by 
refusing to perform military service for reasons of conscience. 
This "spectacular" figure -- in Belloch's own words -- 
represents a 196-percent increase over those recorded six years 
ago, in March 1988. 
  In Belloch's opinion, this increase is mainly due to 
"shortcomings" in the current "model of management and 
administration," which the Conscientious Objection Plan approved 
by the government 11 March is intended to eliminate. The 
justice minister acknowledged the difficulty of its 
implementation, and made its success conditional on cooperation 
by the autonomous communities' administrations. 
  The justice minister said that the regional participation in 
the plan is "crucial" if it is to work. This would make it 
possible to end the current uneven geographic distribution of 
Alternative Social Service (PSS) places. 
  "I have decided to present the plan to the Senate, because 
this is a problem which can only be resolved through regional 
cooperation. Either we succeed in inducing the autonomous 
communities to undertake the responsibility of creating quality 
PSS places, or the plan cannot be implemented at the envisaged 
pace," Belloch told the members of the Senate's Justice 
Committee. 
  Belloch warned that lack of regional cooperation would be to 
their detriment, since objectors would be forced to fill PSS 
places away from their places of residence. 
  In his speech, the justice minister pointed out some of the 
general guidelines followed in drafting the plan. Among others, 
he drew attention to the combining in a single document of the 
recognition of conscientious objector status and the allocation 
of a place to perform the PSS. This will make possible greater 
coordination. 
  The other points cited by Belloch concerned the fact that 
the 
new plan makes it possible to relinquish objector status and to 
conduct personal interviews in cases deemed "dubious"; it will 
attempt to reduce the waiting time from recognition of objector 
status to the allocation of a place to under a year; and 
includes compulsory postings away from the place of residence. 
  For her part, People's Party Senator Rosa Vindel 
acknowledged 
the plan's "good intention," but reminded the minister that 
conscientious objection is a very delicate matter -- a right 
acknowledged by the Constitution -- and that therefore "haste is 
not a good thing." She also stated that the most important 
thing is not the creation of many PSS places but the quality of 
the performance of social service, for which she deemed it 
"essential" that objectors receive training courses.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Eguiagaray: `We Are on Path of </F>
Economic Recovery'"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Industry Minister Juan Manuel 
Eguiagaray announced yesterday that the survey of employers on 
the industrial climate with respect to demand, output, stocks, 
and prices improved by 60 percent between April 1993 and the end 
of February 1994. Eguiagaray pointed out with these figures that 
"we are in an economic recovery, albeit less rapid than we would 
like, but all the indicators show moderate positive growth." 
  The industry minister denied on the same occasion that the 
government will approve fiscal measures to encourage industrial 
vehicle sales similar to those approved for private cars which 
are 10 years old. 
  "I have never said that," he stressed, "and I believe that I 
clearly denied it when I was asked about in Barcelona, Monday." 
  Nevertheless, he specified that the government is studying 
measures for this kind of vehicle, but that they will never be 
of a fiscal nature. 
<H5>  Orders </H5>
  The minister emphasized that the main element of recovery 
during February was foreign trade, but that the domestic trade 
balance has also improved considerably. Business prospects are 
the most favorable since 1991, the minister stated, with a 
5-percent increase in February over January, especially due to 
the improvement in orders both from abroad and from the domestic 
market. 
  Eguiagaray emphasized the trend in the demand for power, 
which, following the sluggishness of 1993, registered a 0.8 
percent increase in the first three months of the year. 
  On prices and wages, the minister said that the trend in 
wages in 1993 was increasingly correct, and stated that the 
improvement in industrial competitiveness was a result more of 
the reduction in personnel than of the fall in unit labor costs. 
  The minister drew attention to industrial prices, "since the 
recovery," he said, "could lead to a rise in these prices in 
1994, although, according to the data at our disposal, it does 
not seem that this will happen, and so profit margins should not 
increase because of the rise in prices." 
  The factors which, according to the Industry Ministry, 
affect 
the favorable trend in the sector are a certain revival of the 
Spanish economy, the reform of the labor market, the reduction 
of interest rates, the sustained recovery of the U.S. and 
British economies, and the positive effects on competitiveness 
in the prices of industrial products. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Henrik Qvortrup report: "The Europe Movement's Own Goal"] </F>
  [Text] Despite everything, on one thing they are agreed: 
Europe is the way forward. But that is about all you can say. 
At the worst possible time -- just as the EU [European Union] 
election campaign is beginning to get under way -- the movement 
which more than any other ought to be the ideological 
counterpart to all the Euroskeptics finds itself in a bitter 
conflict over style, methods, and -- not least -- personalities. 
  The story so far after a stormy meeting last Saturday [16 
April]: 

  -  Laue Traberg Smidt, hitherto the chairman of the 
movement's business committee, has just been thrown out of the 
movement in a coup while he was abroad. 
  -  Because of this, by far 
the most prominent personality in the movement has resigned with 
immediate effect. Her name is Ritt Bjerregaard. 
  -  And today -- 
two months before the elections to the European Parliament -- 
the movement finds itself with a temporary chairman who has only 
one declared aim: To find someone to replace him as soon as 
possible. 
  -  Today the Europe Movement is being led by a group of 
idealistic, but politically very inexperienced grass roots 
figures. 
  A year ago there was a different spirit in the movement. 
After several decades as an ailing popular offshoot of the 
Council of Europe, the movement was injected with new life in 
connection with the two referendums on the European Union. 
Membership rose to its present level of 2,500 and people's 
involvement reached new heights. 
  After the Danes had said "no" in the first vote in 1992, 
there were no disagreements last year when aims and style were 
debated: The second referendum on union was just around the 
corner, and the Danes must be persuaded at all costs that the 
"mistake" of the first referendum should not be repeated. 
  It was at this time that Ritt Bjerregaard traveled round the 
country in her campaign bus as the Europe Movement's standard 
bearer -- with much media attention. Everyone knows the outcome 
of the campaigns of the Europe Movement and the other "yes" 
groups: The Danes did what they were asked to do. 
  The Europe Movement could not, of course, be anything other 
than satisfied. But the movement nevertheless did have a 
problem on its hands: Now there had to be a change of gear. 
From being a out-and-out campaigning organization for a few 
hectic and stirring months, the organization had to make the 
transition to a quieter existence with longer-term goals. And 
this is where things gradually began to go wrong. Roughly 
speaking it was possible to experience inside the organization a 
clash between two fundamentally different approaches to running 
an organization, a movement: 
  Should the movement set up the huge formal apparatus typical 
of associations and societies -- with the summoning of countless 
central board, business committee, and subcommittee meetings? 
  Or should it simply -- totally without bureaucracy -- try to 
work for the European cause? 
  The young and the less politically experienced in the 
organization inclined toward the first view. Led by the newly 
elected chairman of the business committee, Carl Thaarup-Hansen, 
the foot soldiers tried to pull the movement in the direction of 
more popular involvement for the European cause. 
  Even though everyone in the Europe Movement has always 
respected Ritt Bjerregaard's political flair and knowledge, she 
did nevertheless begin to cause irritation around her. 
  In quiet corners more and more people were saying that Ritt 
Bjerregaard -- supported by Laue Traberg Smidt -- was simply 
using the Europe Movement as a platform for her own attempt to 
go it alone politically. 
  It could be this discontent which -- somewhat irrationally, 
perhaps -- cost Laue Traberg Smidt his post in the Europe 
Movement last Saturday. Social Democrat Ritt Bjerregaard and 
Liberal Party Traberg Smidt -- who despite their different party 
political affiliations want the same for Europe -- preferred a 
very different way of running the movement than the more 
earthbound Euro-idealists. 
  The two of them gave pride of place to a management-oriented 
style -- the sort of style which gives priority to highly paid 
guest speakers over popular parades on the country's pedestrian 
streets. 
  And to the great annoyance of the grass roots, who felt that 
things were going over their heads, the politically much more 
experienced duo of Bjerregaard and Traberg Smidt were pushing 
through their style and methods -- despite all the bureaucratic 
rules: 
  Ritt Bjerregaard and Laue Traberg Smidt saw to it that they 
pulled all the right political strings round about. 
  And, by eating their way through an endless number of 
lunches 
with representatives of Danish industry and commerce, the 
unusual duo made sure that a tidy sum of money -- sources 
mention a figure of 3 million kroner -- was collected for the 
fight for a more united Europe. 
  After the weekend both Ritt Bjerregaard and Laue Traberg 
Smidt are both out. Probably for ever. Among those who remain 
in the Europe Movement it is time for the hangover and the 
soul-searching. 
  And among the Euroskeptics there is, naturally enough, 
general satisfaction at the movement's extraordinarily badly 
timed own goal. 
  They had not even dared dream of such a start to the 
upcoming 
elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna-Leena Pyykkonen: "Ahtisaari's Advisor, Alpo </F>
Rusi: President Wants To Listen to Nation's Pulse"] 
  [Text] New winds are blowing in the president's 
administration. Alpo Rusi, Martti Ahtisaari's foreign policy 
advisor and a member of his cabinet, told us about them. He held 
forth at an Association of Political Editors lunch conference on 
Wednesday [30 March]. 
  Rusi said that a direct referendum will also force us to 
look 
for new ways of taking action. One of these is the president's 
direct contact with citizens. "The president wants to listen to 
the pulse of the nation. He can also instill courage in citizens 
in this tight spot we are in," Rusi said. 
  According to Rusi, Ahtisaari's first meeting with citizens 
in 
central Finland was a pleasant experience. The president wants 
to be in contact with citizens in the future "without waiting 
lines." 
  Rusi was pressed for an answer to the question as to whether 
the wielding of power or even competition with the government in 
the area of domestic policy will also be associated with [the 
president's] rounds in the provinces. 
  Rusi assured us that behind these visits there was at least 
no deliberate effort to wield power or consciously impose a 
political viewpoint. 
  "Direct dialogue with citizens has been lacking from Nordic 
democracy," Rusi said. He also alluded to our possible 
membership in the EU, and noted that, as the supranational 
exercise of power increases, one's own democracy must be in good 
working order. 
  Rusi said the president also wants to be "more 
communicative" 
and he is accustomed to "rapid communication." 
<H5>  "Spokesman," a New Practice </H5>
  The number of the presidential advisors has been increased 
by 
four. The advisors from the cabinet, in which Rusi is on loan 
from the Foreign Ministry, constitute the most important ones. 
He most recently served in the ministry as a foreign policy 
advisor. Before that, he served as chief editor and researcher 
on the Centrist paper LALLI, among other posts. 
  Rusi takes care of the president's relations with the 
international press and reports on events occurring in 
connection with visits. He may also issue statements, that is, 
he may act as a sort of "spokesman." This practice is new in 
Finland. 
  Rusi was asked how the cabinet has been preparing for the 
visit of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of Russia's Liberal 
Democratic Party, to Finland. 
  Rusi said that they are closely following Zhirinovskiy's 
behavior. "We will certainly hold onto our own authority," he 
went on. 
  Zhirinovskiy is coming to Finland this Easter with Russia's 
Council of Europe delegation.

<F P=106> [Article by Olli Ainola: "Baltic Policy: Arms Sale </F>
Restrictions Being Rescinded"] 
  [Text] Finland has changed the principles of its arms sale 
policy. Prevention of exports has been converted to promotion of 
exports. As its domestic sales are drying up, the defense 
industry is attempting to assure its survival through export 
sales. 
  A promising market is seen in the former Warsaw Pact 
countries, especially the Baltics, after Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the export control 
organization, makes changes in its structure this week. Finland 
is following other Western countries, including the United 
States, that have decided to rescind the arms export ban to 
those countries, even for combat aircraft. 
  The enthusiasm of Finnish arms plants for exporting to the 
Baltic countries has been held in check above all by the 
Paasikivi Doctrine [policy formulated by post-World War II 
President J.K. Paasikivi according to which Finland should 
refrain from actions displeasing to Moscow]. The foreign policy 
leadership has not wanted to provide export licenses for actual 
lethal weapons and equipment as long as there are Russian 
military units in the Baltic countries. 
  A couple of years ago, the Sako arms plant was denied a 
license to export 5,000 assault rifles to any of the three 
Baltic countries. According to officials, the application was 
purely a demonstration of intent, because the document lacked 
end-user information, among other things. Sako said it had 
provided end-user information, and that the export sale was 
prevented solely for political reasons. 
  If Russian forces withdraw from the Baltic countries and the 
situation becomes stable, authorities promise to free the export 
of arms and combat equipment. Even after these conditions are 
met, however, licenses are going to be carefully considered, 
especially if a deal were to involve a political commitment to 
provide spare parts or resupply in event of crisis or war. 
  The first preview of the new policy may soon be seen. Finns 
have under discussion deals for final assembly work, selling 
components and raw materials to ammunition plants in Estonia and 
Latvia. The licenses officials regard these deals favorably.

<F P=106> [Mariann Nordstrom report: "Poll: Iceland Takes More </F>
Positive View of EU"] 
  [Text] For the first time Icelanders take a positive view 
of EU [European Union] membership. 
  Europe is changing, and the Icelanders are worried. This is 
now being reflected in the fact that a majority now takes a less 
negative view than before of the possibility of EU membership. 
A recent opinion poll shows that a majority want Iceland to 
begin membership negotiations. 
  The opinion poll was carried out between 22 March and 3 
April, and Gallup Iceland asked the question: Do you think that 
Iceland should start membership negotiations with the EU? 
  Of those interviewed, 69.2 percent want negotiations to 
start, while 30.8 percent said "no." 
  Past opinion polls -- the last one was just before Christmas 
-- have never produced any results like this. The most positive 
pro-EU result has been 50-50 support for the EEA [European 
Economic Area] agreement. A year ago support for membership 
negotiations was between 20 and 30 percent. 
  The head of Gallup Iceland's international section, 
Hafsteinn 
Mar Einarsson, said that 64.2 percent of the men interviewed 
said "yes" to membership negotiations, while a total of 76.5 
percent of the women were in favor. 
  The largest amount of support among those interviewed was to 
be found among supporters of Prime Minister David Oddsson's 
Independence Party and Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin 
Hannibalsson's Social Democrats -- both at 75 percent. "But 
regardless of party affiliations the majority were for 
membership negotiations," Einarsson said. 
  The reason is, he believes, that now that most of Iceland's 
partners in EFTA [European Free Trade Association] are moving 
toward the EU, Icelanders have grown anxious about becoming 
isolated. 
  "We Icelanders feel we belong to the Nordic area. Now that 
the rest of the Nordic area could become part of the European 
Union, Icelanders are voicing the view that the possibility of 
following should be investigated," he said, stressing that no 
one has interpreted the poll to mean the Icelanders have now 
said "yes" to membership, only to the possibility of reaching a 
decision on the result of possible future negotiations, he said. 
  A total of 1,200 people were approached and 71 percent 
responded.

<F P=106> [Harald Stanghelle report: "Continued Massive `No' to the </F>
EU"] 
  [Excerpt] According to Opinion's April EU [European Union] 
poll, 48 percent say "no" to EU membership, while 33 percent day 
"yes," and 19 percent have not made up their minds. 
  But the poll also shows that if Sweden and Finland become 
members, the mood would change: Then 42 percent would say 
"yes," 37 percent "no," while 21 percent have not made up their 
minds. 
  The poll was carried out from Monday to Wednesday [11-13 
April] this week and is the first Opinion poll since voters have 
had the opportunity to follow the debate on the agreement 
reached with the EU. Several polls, undertaken in the days 
after the text of the agreement became known, showed major 
swings, while Opinion's April poll shows a body of public 
opinion on the EU issue which does not seem to have been much 
influenced by Norway's EU agreement. The "yes" side receives a 
2 percent increase in support, while the "no" side falls back 1 
percent, but relative strengths are exactly the same today as 
they were a month ago. It is also worth noting that the "yes" 
side is well below its 37 percent support in January this year. 
  The poll shows that the choices which Sweden and Finland 
make 
are important to many voters, but we also asked them about the 
timing of Norway's referendum in relation to that of Sweden. It 
turns out that 44 percent of voters want the referendum on the 
same day as Sweden, 40 percent want the referendum after that of 
Sweden, while 16 percent do not have any firm views on the 
matter. A total of 64 percent of "yes" voters want a Norwegian 
referendum after Sweden's, while 62 percent of "no" voters want 
the referendum on the same day as Sweden's. In other words, 
there can be no doubt that voters believe that the timing of the 
referendum will be very important for its result. 
  This was also shown by the poll when Opinion asked how 
voters 
will vote if Sweden and Finland join the European Union: 42 
percent said "yes," 37 percent "no," and 21 percent had no firm 
view on the question of membership. The "yes" side leads by 5 
percent, and Opinion has not registered so clear an advantage 
for the "yes" side on this issue before. The position of the 
voters seems to be that, if at the time of a Norwegian 
referendum, it is already clear Sweden and Finland will become 
members of the EU, Norway has no choice but to follow. [passage

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said 
the Cypriot Government has not been sounded out on any changes 
to the 21 March UN document on the confidence-building measures. 
He added that the position of the Greek Cypriot side is that it 
accepts the document as is, while Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas is raising many points other than the issue of access to 
Famagusta. 
  The spokesman stressed that Kliridhis is ready to meet 
either 
with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, or Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, to 
reiterate that he has accepted the document as is and expects 
the Turkish side to do the same. Kasoulidhis concluded that the 
president is ready to say that he will accept neither new 
documents nor a modification of the current document.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has stressed that 
continuing to recognize the Greek Cypriot Administration as the 
government for all of Cyprus is not an approach that will help 
the search for peace. 
  Atun issued a written statement today in connection with the 
report President Clinton submitted to Congress on the Cyprus 
question. Atun pointed out that once again Clinton failed to 
adopt an equal and balanced approach toward the two peoples in 
Cyprus. The prime minister said: It should have been understood 
by now that referring to Kliridhis as the Cypriot president will 
not help the solution of the Cyprus problem; rather, it will 
encourage Greek Cypriot intransigence. Kliridhis is the leader 
of the Greek Cypriot Administration, which does not represent 
the Turkish Cypriot people. He has been elected only by the 
Greek Cypriot people. The legitimate Cyprus Government, which 
is sovereign over the whole of Cyprus based on agreements, 
ceased to exist in 1963. 
  Atun recalled that the Cyprus Government was turned into a 
Cyprus state through military force and occupation. Even though 
the United States is aware of these facts, he said, it continues 
to recognize the Greek Cypriot Administration as the legitimate 
Cyprus government. This approach cannot help the search for 
peace, he stressed. 
  Atun said: It is noteworthy that Mr. Clinton never mentions 
in his report the hostile policies being escalated by the Greek 
Cypriots at every platform. 
  The prime minister expressed the hope that the U.S. 
Administration will show the necessary initiative to correct 
this situation and to end an approach that is totally 
incompatible with the spirit and content of the 
confidence-building measures. This would help the negotiation 
process, he added. 
  Atun pointed out that the most important obstacle, both 
before a final solution and before the confidence-building 
measures, is the fact that the Greek Cypriot Administration is 
recognized as the legitimate government for all of Cyprus, even 
though it does not have the legal basis for that, and the 
insistence of third parties in refusing to treat the two peoples 
equally. He stressed that by changing this erroneous attitude 
and by treating both sides equally, third parties will create 
the necessary conditions for the success of the negotiations.

  [Text] Ozker Ozgur, minister of state and deputy prime 
minister, who also heads the Politbureau [not further 
identified] and is one of the owners of the Elmaslar Company, 
has conveyed several letters to President Denktas. These 
letters can be described as memorandums calling for the 
immediate signing of the package of confidence-building 
measures. Ozgur's memorandums also upheld several views that 
are in parallel with those that have been expressed by Greek 
Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis; Joe Clark, the UN secretary 
general's special representative; and Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative. 
  Ozgur leaked his letters through mediators to the Greek 
Cypriot side in order to convey particular messages to the Greek 
Cypriots. The Greek Cypriot newspapers reported on Ozgur's 
memorandums shortly after they were conveyed to Denktas. 
  We acquired three of the letters, which can be described as 
memorandums, some time ago. We urged those who promised to 
establish a clear administration before the election in 1993 to 
make them public. Denktas and Ozgur, however, preferred not to 
do so. 
  So we decided to publish Ozker Ozgur's first memorandum, 
dated 11 March 1994, today. In it, Ozgur opposes Denktas' 
statement that he has lost confidence in Butrus Butrus-Ghali and 
says that what Denktas has said is an obstacle to the UN 
secretary general's effort. He opposes placing sovereignty on 
the agenda and the effort made to hold talks on the essence of 
the Cyprus problem before the package of confidence-building 
measures is put into effect. Ozgur describes that approach as a 
delaying tactic. Ozker Ozgur also opposes the inclination to 
seek recourse in the Republican Assembly on legal changes. His 
letter reads as follows: 
  TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf 
Denktas, Nicosia. 
  According to page one of the records of the 10 March 1994 
meeting, we expressed the view that talks on the essence of the 
Cyprus problem should not be held before all the necessary 
procedures relating to the confidence-building measures package 
are complete. But the work to repair Maras [Varosha] will take 
five years. The international community will not agree to 
suspend the work on the essence of the problem for that long. 
We must realize that we must benefit from the situation created 
by the existing conditions in our favor. 
  You have noted in the records that holding talks on issues 
concerning a comprehensive solution, the issue of "sovereignty" 
for example, will be useful when negotiations are held on the 
confidence-building measures package. But considering that we 
have agreed to hold talks on the confidence-building measures 
package, an initiative to hold talks on a comprehensive 
agreement may be seen as a delaying tactic. That could be used 
against us. 
  The confidence-building measures package clearly states that 
the sides will maintain their positions. 
  According to paragraph five, page two, we opposed the 
proposal for the transfer of authority to UNTA to enable it to 
enact or amend laws and suggested that the two sides be 
consulted on any legal change that will be effected. But 
reference to the parliaments of the two sides is unnecessary 
within that framework. The main point, the right one, is our 
insistence on holding consultations with the two sides. The 
same paragraph also says that the communal leaders will be 
consulted before any change is made. 
  We deem it useful to oppose the footnote on page one in the 
draft. The UN secretary general has taken up a goodwill mission 
in connection with the package of confidence-building measures. 
Although we are convinced that you are justified in your 
sensitive approach that the bounds of the UN secretary general's 
goodwill mission must not be exceeded before the process is 
complete, we believe that expressing a lack of confidence in the 
UN secretary general in advance, that is, before it is confirmed 
that the bounds of his goodwill mission have been exceeded, will 
be wrong. It will harm our image as the side that cooperates 
with the UN secretary general. 
  We draw your attention to the points we have mentioned in 
this letter and convey our respects. 
  [Signed] Ozker Ozgur, leader of the Republic Turkish Party 
  [Date] 11 March 1994

  [Text] The government is not handling the monitoring of 
National Guard work at Larnaca Airport as espionage. The 
security authorities, however, are continuing to follow the 
moves of members of foreign embassies who are trying to collect 
information on Cyprus' defense. 
  Alternate British High Commissioner Colin Jennings visited 
Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Tasos Panayidhis to explain 
the presence of British military officers at Larnaca Airport 
last Sunday [17 April]. According to information from British 
sources, Jennings claimed that the military officers--two of 
whom were at the airport with their children--were observing 
airplanes landing and taking off. According to the Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC], Lieutenant Colonel John 
Anderson, the British military charge d'affaires, was one of the 
military officers. He gave his identification to security men 
when they asked him for it and left the airport. The British 
claim that Anderson was not at the airport last Sunday, but they 
have confirmed that he was on a one-week leave of absence from 
the High Commission. 
  Denying reports by other media, a reliable source explicitly 
told CyBC that no Cypriot is involved in the case. Government 
spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today told reporters that the 
government is not handling the case as espionage. 
  According to CyBC's information, foreign missions in Cyprus 
and Greece have recently embarked on a campaign to collect 
information on the implementation of the new defense doctrine. 
The same sources said Cypriot security authorities are trying 
to limit the efforts of foreign missions to collect information 
on the National Guard.

  [Text] In an arrival statement at Larnaca Airport this 
afternoon, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said Cyprus has 
achieved very advanced positions at the European Union 
[EU]-Cyprus Association Council, which conferred in Luxembourg 
last night. Mikhailidhis described the Council's meeting as a 
great political achievement for Cyprus, because one of the two 
goals--to include Cyprus in the countries that will participate 
in the EU expansion--was achieved. The second goal, he said, 
was establishing a date to begin accession negotiations. 
  Referring to the joint statement of the Twelve, Mikhailidhis 
said the positions adopted are much more advanced than the ones 
we have had so far. He added that there is clear reference that 
human rights for all citizens must be safeguarded without any 
limitations or distinctions, and that any settlement or solution 
must be in line with the EU foundation principles. Mikhailidhis 
said: This means that the Cypriot Government's initial 
position--that a Cyprus solution must conform to EU principles 
and will allow us to enter and operate within the 
community--today has become an EU decision. 
  Discussing the confidence-building measures, the foreign 
minister said the joint statement clearly holds the Turkish side 
exclusively responsible and hails the Cypriot Government's 
constructive stance. 
  On the prospects of the EU accession of Cyprus, Mikhailidhis 
said January 1995 has already been set as the date to reevaluate 
Cyprus' application and the entire course for accession.

  [Excerpt] Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis, National 
Guard Commander Lieutenant General Nikolaos Vorvolakos as well 
as other officials and National Guard officers will pay an 
important exploratory visit to Russia right after Easter. 
  According to our information, the visit by the Defense 
Ministry political leadership and the National Guard General 
Staff military leaders falls within the framework of checking 
out sources for the military strengthening of the National Guard. 
  The same sources also place the visit to Russia within the 
current government's efforts to purchase better weapons systems 
and other materiel for Cyprus' defense at the lowest possible 
prices now that the Government has decided to cease dealing with 
the French company SOFMA [French Weapons Equipment Company]. 
  It is further noted that the Cypriot side will primarily 
focus on gathering information. This will not be limited to 
some specific weapons which the National Guard has in mind, but 
will also cover the technical support to be given in the event 
there are some purchases. 
  We should also note that Russia and some other countries of 
the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc have informed the 
government that they would agree to payment through offset 
trade, that is, payment with Cypriot products. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Dhimitrios Fikas from New York] </F>
  [Text] Political observers consider Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou's visit to the United States to be of 
historic significance to Greek-U.S. relations. The official 
visit will begin 19 April and last until 24 April; the prime 
minister will then move on to New York for meetings with Greek 
community officials and other diplomats. 
  The White House looks forward to the meeting between U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Papandreou, with particular interest 
in bilateral issues and the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. 
The Greek side will mainly raise our national issues: Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], the Cyprus 
issue, respect for the rights of the Greek minority in North 
Ipiros, and bilateral economic and defense cooperation. 
  Some circles in the U.S. State Department and at the 
Pentagon 
do not view Greece's role positively and are exerting some 
pressure. According to unverified information, last week the 
U.S. secretary of state was ready to issue a statement 
criticizing Greece's handling of Skopje. In any case, such a 
statement was not issued. White House adviser George 
Stefanopoulos personally told Athens Elliniki Radiofonia today 
that the White House considers the prime minister's trip to be 
of substantive significance. 
  Greek-Turkish relations are also on the agenda. President 
Clinton is particularly concerned with the tension in the 
region. It is indicative that although his meeting with Turkish 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller last week was unofficial, Clinton 
raised the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations, noting that 
there must be self-restraint, and a worsening of the situation 
in the region must be avoided. 
  Regarding the Skopje issue, the picture is not very positive 
for Greece right now. International mediator Cyrus Vance 
continues the proximity talks in New York. There was a marathon 
two and a half hour meeting tonight, which ended 45 minutes ago, 
between Vance and Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, our Foreign 
Ministry secretary general. Afterward, Zakharakis confirmed 
that the Greek side had submitted notes on Vance's ideas on how 
to break the deadlock. We have reported that the Vance formula 
provides for negotiations in three phases. In the first phase, 
there is to be a simultaneous lifting of the embargo and a 
statement from Skopje assuring of the border's inviolability and 
giving guarantees about its constitution. The disputed points of 
that constitution--the symbols and the flag--will be discussed 
in the second phase. The name issue will be discussed in the 
third phase. Our information is that neither Skopje nor the 
Greek side accept Vance's ideas in their current form [words 
indistinct]. 
  We have just received a statement--in the form of 
propaganda-- from the permanent Albanian delegation to the 
United Nations. Its title is: Greece Continues Its 
Provocations Against Albania. The statement includes the 
official protest of the Albanian Embassy in Athens made last 
Friday [15 April], about the incident of the seizure of the 
Greek fishing boat Ayios Vasilis. The Albanians claim the 
fishing boat violated their territorial waters and imply that 
the incident was planned.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "It Must Understand"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's trip to the 
United States offers the opportunity to raise the Greek problems 
and Greek views on the critical issues in the Balkans, but also 
to make the U.S. leadership understand our country's positions 
and the positive role it can play for peace in the region. 
  The U.S. leadership must understand that Greece is the only 
factor for stability in this inflammable region. Its positive 
actions in dealing with the crisis have proved this. 
  It must understand that Greece is neither threatening nor 
provoking anyone. On the contrary, it is being threatened and 
provoked by its neighbors. 
  It must understand that with Skopje's [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] insistence on using a Greek name 
and Greek historical symbols as well as being "irredeemable," 
Skopje is provoking the feelings of Greeks. No solution can be 
found if Skopje does not bend in its intransigence. 
  It must understand that occupation of half of Cyprus cannot 
continue and Turkish intransigence cannot obstruct the finding 
of a solution. Turkey is not limiting its actions to this but 
escalates its provocations against Greece every chance it gets. 
  It must understand that Greece wants friendly relations with 
Albania and has no reason for causing tension. Its only demand 
is to protect the rights of the Greek minority. 
  It must understand that Greek-American relations can develop 
even further for mutual benefit as well as peace and economic 
development in the region. 
  It seems that the U.S. leadership is particularly interested 
in economic cooperation. Greece has already developed 
initiatives in the Balkans and achieved serious business 
cooperation in most countries. 
  There is no other country in the region with more advantages 
and desire for peace that would support any U.S initiative for 
peaceful economic cooperation. 
  A spectacular change in the U.S. position cannot be 
expected. 
It is expected, however, that U.S. President Bill Clinton will 
keep his preelection promises and support Greek rights.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stavros Liyeros: "The Most Appropriate </F>
Moment"] 
  [Text] In a few days Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou will visit the United States and discuss the Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. This 
may be the most appropriate time for Greek diplomacy to show its 
flexibility by opening up the road to an overall agreement that 
will definitively settle the problem. 
  The tactic of negotiating in phases is now counterproductive 
and disadvantageous for our country. Prime Minister Papandreou 
should dare to get involved in the substantive negotiations over 
their name, even if it is not assured that such negotiations 
will end in the complete abolition of the term "Macedonia." It 
is obvious that if he avoids this, it will result in the "de 
facto" acceptance of the complete international acceptance of 
the current name "Republic of Macedonia." Even if this is not a 
crime of omission, it would still be a crime. 
  Before the embargo, imposing preliminary conditions was 
meaningful. Now that the embargo was been imposed though, the 
balance has drastically changed in Athens' favor. As long as 
the embargo is being strictly implemented, Greece will have 
every interest in having a dialogue on the name, for it can aim 
for a package agreement. First of all, Greece will make the 
best impression because it will appear to be compromising and 
pliable regarding the process, without even having to make a 
compromise. In the international arena, anyone who makes 
conditions for beginning talks is fighting the battle of 
impressions from a disadvantageous position. 
  If Athens accepts the resumption of a dialogue, the dilemma 
will be Skopje's. It will either refuse and thus be the target 
of pressure, or it will begin talks under the disadvantage of 
the embargo. The embargo will put pressure on them, not only on 
the secondary issues such as the flag and constitution, but also 
on the main issue of the name. What is indispensable to the 
nation is to search for a name that will reflect reality and not 
affect either side. One such solution could be the name 
Slavomadeconian for the nationality, and Slavomacedonia for the 
country. It is the only way to achieve the famous 
"de-Skopjenization" acceptably, with no one coming out the loser.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton-Papandreou"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's official visit 
to the United States is taking place at an unfavorable period 
for our country. This is because Greek interest has unavoidably 
focused on Washington's intervention to break Skopje's [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] intransigence. As 
a result, all other issues that should have been at the top of 
the agenda in Greek-U.S. summit talks (the Cyprus issue, 
Greek-Turkish relations, upgrading of Greece's role in the 
Balkans) are placed below. 
  We can see that the priorities of Athens and Washington in 
the talks are not completely identical. Regarding the Balkans, 
the U.S. Government is mainly interested in maintaining 
stability in the southern region of the peninsula at any cost. 
This means that the argument that Greece is the most stable and 
the strongest-- politically and economically--country in the 
region, has been working against us from the time that we had 
bilateral problems with our northern "weak, unstable, and 
insecure" neighbors. It is becoming more difficult to persuade 
the Americans (as well as West Europe) that Greek reaction 
against Skopjean provocations or violation of the Greek 
minority's human rights by Tirana is correct. Equally without 
impact is the argument that our country is facing mid-level 
dangers from the stance of our neighbors because our allies and 
partners are struggling to prevent immediate and destructive 
developments in the Balkans. 
  Something similar is happening with Washington's current 
stance toward Turkey. The U.S. Government seems to be concerned 
about the strengthening of Islamism in our neighboring country, 
the domestic unrest because of the Kurdish issue, and the 
possibility of an unexpected and uncontrolled situation that 
will destabilize Turkey. It is certain that these are the 
"facts" that mainly formulate the U.S. policy in the 
Greek-Turkish dispute and the Cyprus issue. Washington 
accordingly divides its intervention interest in Athens and 
Ankara for immediate resumption of Greek-Turkish dialogue and 
the "mutual" concessions that must be made in the Cyprus issue 
to resume the intercommunal dialogue. 
  All of the above concepts certainly do not aim to preordain 
a 
failure of the Greek-U.S. talks. They aim at exactly the 
opposite: to make the political leadership the general public 
understand all of the parameters that will formulate the 
"outcome" and the "significance" of the summit meeting in 
Washington. Because, most probably, nothing will be judged at 
the Clinton-Papandreou talks that will be irrevocably against or 
permanently for our national interests....

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolaos Khasapopoulos] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton will propose North Macedonia 
as the name for Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] at his White House meeting on Friday [22 
April] with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou. 
  Diplomatic sources in Athens revealed that the U.S. 
ambassador to Greece, Thomas Niles, had personally vetted North 
Macedonia as the best name for Skopje in a confidential cable to 
the State Department, shortly before Mr Papandreou's departure 
for Washington on Monday. The premier arrived last night in 
Washington. 
  Mr Niles confided to a group of Greek diplomats he had 
invited for dinner at his home. He said he thought the question 
of the Skopje flag and any usurpation of Greek symbols were 
capable of quick resolution once the name issue had been agreed. 
The ambassador conveyed his optimism that the Greek premier's 
visit to the White House would be "productive." 
  "If you manage to wrap up the Skopje issue, Greece can then 
become the major power in the Balkans" and dominate the region 
economically, the U.S. envoy was quoted as telling his Greek 
guests. 
  When Mr Niles was asked by his guests whether Skopje 
President Kiro Gligorov would agree to a North Macedonia deal, 
their host replied that "this name has already been tabled" at 
the meetings which UN mediator Cyrus Vance has held in New York 
with Skopje's Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski and the Greek 
envoy Khristos Zakharakis. 
  Mr Niles is also said to have revealed U.S. initiatives on 
armed flights over the Aegean by both Turkey and Greece, 
pressuring each side to stop the flights which provoke tension 
in Greek-Turkish relations.

  [Text] Greek and Albanian delegations met in Ioannina today 
for an initial examination of issues under their authority ahead 
of a meeting between their foreign ministers. The delegations 
included representatives of the Public Order and Foreign Affairs 
Ministries of the two countries. Correspondents report that the 
meeting dealt with events at the Ano Episkopi Military Camp and 
the issue of the Albanian illegal immigrants, whose number at 
the Greek-Albanian border has increased. 
  Yeoryios Kirousis, our correspondent in Ioannina, reports 
that most of the arrested North Epirus Greek-Albanians, members 
of the organization Omonoia [Greek-Albanians Association], have 
been taken to Tirana. No one knows how many Omonoia members 
have been arrested from Sarande, Delvine, Himare, Gjirokaster, 
Tepelene and (Premetis). Omonoia President Sotirios Kiriazatis 
also went to Tirana for meetings with government officials to 
discuss the persecution of the Greek minority in Albania. The 
latest mass arrests and strong police presence in the towns and 
villages of North Epirus have reportedly created fear among the 
Greek minority. The residents of the area avoid moving far from 
their homes and stay indoors after sunset. 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias stressed that the Greek 
Government condemns and protests the profound and continuous 
persecution of the Greek minority by the Albanian authorities. 
The foreign minister made his statement after the mass arrests 
of Omonoia members in Gjirokaster yesterday. These actions, he 
said, violate basic human rights and personal liberties. 
Papoulias added: The Greek people, who generously welcome and 
host thousands of Albanian citizens, question and feel offended 
by the Albanian authorities' behavior against the Greek minority 
in Albania. The foreign minister stresses that the government 
will take all the necessary steps and make representations to 
protect the Greek minority's internationally safeguarded rights.

<F P=106> [By Kostas Iordhanidhis] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Balkan operetta staged last week by the 
Albanian regime proves that, just as his predecessors Enver 
Hoxha and Ramiz Alia, [Albanian President] Sali Berisha needs to 
invoke a "foreign threat in order to survive domestically." 
  To carry out domestic terrorism, Hoxha built a series of 
pill 
boxes throughout the fields and beaches of Albania. [passage 
omitted] 
  Today Hoxha's "defense system" seems hilarious, but it 
worked 
effectively in justifying economic sacrifices and enforcing 
internal terrorism for decades. Berisha, who is a product of 
the same system, resorted to the same technique to justify a 
possible increase in "security measures" in North Epirus. 
  The incident of the murder of two men at an Albanian 
military 
camp, if indeed it happened, appears to be a classic provocation 
or invention. The reports about the infiltration of persons in 
Greek uniforms who attacked the Albanian military camp reminds 
one of similar hoaxes by Hoxha's regime, who in 1983, for the 
last time, made allegations to the international public that 
foreign agents had invaded the Albanian coast. Their names were 
never made public, but the security authorities claimed that the 
suspects were masked and carried foreign currency, Greek 
drachmas and Italian lira. [passage omitted] 
  The dominant view in Athens is that Berisha was encouraged 
by 
Western governments, with particular suspicion centering on 
Turkey, in order to launch this extremely powerful attack on 
Greece with verbal charges and letters to the Security Council. 
  What is most probable though, is that the Albanian president 
attempted to capitalize on the prevailing negative climate to 
add one more charge that Greece is destabilizing the Balkans. 
  Having limited political experience, however, he went beyond 
the tolerable limits, which reliable sources say prompted the 
United States and Germany to intervene to calm things down. 
This should finally lead to the resolution of the whole crisis, 
especially following Berisha's retreat on Thursday [14 April] 
when he noted that the Greek Government may not be completely 
responsible for the incident at Episkopi. 
  Furthermore, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi agreed 
to hold a meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, 
proposing 21 April in Bucharest. He said he is open to other 
dates and venues. In addition, Albania agreed to convene an 
experts' meeting--which had long been planned--and it will also 
deal with the border incident. The Albanians have not yet given 
a positive answer to the Greek Government's proposal for a 
meeting between the commanders of the Gjirokaster and Ioannina 
military units. 
  Irrespective of the turn that the Greek-Albanian crisis has 
taken, however, it is clear by now that the situation could very 
easily get out of control with very serious consequences for the 
region's stability as well as the welfare of the Greek minority 
in Albania. 
  It is clear that the Berisha regime is concerned not simply 
because of the so-called "politicization" of the minority, but 
mainly because of the activities of the Greeks which make them 
the most important economic factor in North Epirus and the whole 
of Albania. 
  From this point of view, it is not a accidental that the 
Albanian authorities have recently arrested Greek businessmen 
for possessing foreign currency (Greek drachmas), changed the 
customs officials along the Greek-Albanian border, changed signs 
written in Greek, and exercised tremendous pressure on small 
businessmen and other residents of North Epirus. 
  It is obvious that the issue of the Greek minority must be 
dealt with in a new framework, because it is not possible for 
the Greeks of Albania to be plunged from a being under police 
observation into being hostages to serve the domestic needs of 
the regime in Tirana. [passage omitted] 
  Our country's policy toward the Greeks of Albania should 
have 
clear goals and firm in tone, and it should at least aim to 
safeguard all their rights as provided by international 
agreements. No government or political system in Greece can 
tolerate the enslavement of the North Epirus residents.

  [Text] Answering reporters' questions on what the 
Government intends to do about the arrests of Greeks in Albania, 
Government Spokesman Evangelos today said that Greece has made 
all necessary diplomatic demarches on the Albanian authorities' 
wave of arrests against the Greek minority. It is also waiting 
for Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' meeting with Albanian 
Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi on 3 May in Zurich. 
  Venizelos stressed: Greece cannot take a casual or timid 
stance considering it is a guarantor in the region. Therefore, 
it is acting in a low-key manner to avoid any misunderstandings. 
The spokesman noted: Anyone who misunderstands our muted 
approach will be making a political mistake. I am referring to 
Albania. 
  The spokesman stressed that trumped up charges are 
unacceptable. He said: The improvement of Greek-Albanian 
relations depends on respect for the Greek minority's human 
rights, international law, and the standard of human rights 
traditional to European civilization. Venizelos added: This 
[Orthodox] Easter [1 May], the Albanian authorities must prove 
that they respect freedom of religion. 
  The Greek Government will proceed to reduce the staff of the 
Albanian Embassy in Athens, because Albanian President Sali 
Berisha's government has not reconsidered their decision to 
reduce the staff of the Greek Embassy in Tirana. We remind you 
that the staff of the Greek Embassy in the Albanian capital has 
been reduced by 30 percent. 
  A short time ago, REUTER NEWS AGENCY reported from Athens 
that an Albanian diplomat had been informed that he must leave 
the country by tomorrow. REUTER added that this is the second 
incident in the past 10 days resulting from the tension between 
the Greek and Albanian Governments.

  [Text] Greek Deputy National Defense Minister Nikolaos 
Kouris said the unified defense doctrine has a clearly defensive 
and preventive dimension, which at the same time improves the 
negotiating position of Cyprus during the talks being held under 
UN auspices. 
  Speaking last night in Athens, Kouris also stressed that 
Turkey's provocations in connection with challenging Greek 
airspace over the Aegean has caused tension that could erupt 
into violent incidents at any time. If the violent incidents 
increase, he added, they could lead to a huge clash. Kouris 
also said that Turkey's direct military threats, with actions 
and plans against Cyprus and Greece, come from Ankara's 
intention to change the balance of power in the region. He said 
that Greece also faces medium- and long-term threats in relation 
to Macedonia and North Epirus.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Revision"] </F>
  [Text] Greece has become involved in the Balkan crisis. 
The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] and the aggravation of our relations with 
Albania have dragged Greece into the European and international 
arbitration of the litigious Balkan countries. 
  This is the harsh reality. Our country's Balkan policy has 
drifted along filled with contradictions and without a strategy 
or long-term goals. It failed in its goal and missed its 
opportunities to play a beneficial role in the Balkan 
developments and the economic and democratic reconstruction of 
the Balkan countries. 
  This was revealed and indirectly admitted by Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou in his address at PASOK's [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] Third Congress. Papandreou said: 
  "No contradiction can hide the fact that the Greeks have 
begun to find their natural role in the Balkans. Half of the 
foreign investments in Bulgaria now are Greek. In Albania, 
Greek companies have set up 54 joint companies, making us second 
after Italy. In Romania, there are 700 joint Greek-Romanian 
companies." 
  Private initiative revealed Greece's natural role in the 
Balkans. The state, various Greek administrations, and political 
leadership have not yet realized what Greece's natural role in 
the Balkans is. They have not been able to deal with the 
histrionic and offensive loose tongues of our neighbors by 
countering with daring economic and political openings to the 
Balkan countries. 
  In his letter to Papandreou, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
accepts the Greek plans for the establishment of joint 
Greek-U.S. companies in the Balkans. This economic cooperation 
will be at the center of their talks during the meeting they 
will have this week in Washington. 
  But how will these plans proceed? How will the natural role 
in the Balkans of Greece and the Greek people be able to come to 
the fore now that Greece is involved in the Balkan crisis? The 
Greek Government should overcome this contradiction with a 
daring revision of Greece's Balkan policy. This is the only way 
for Greece's role in the Balkans to dominate and contribute to 
the peace and development of the Balkans, and this would be 
beneficial to our national aims too.

  [Text] Ankara, April 20 (AA) -- Turkey is against any kind 
of forceful border changing policy, the Foreign Ministry said on 
Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly 
briefing that a draft was signed by the 11-nation Minsk Group in 
an effort to find a solution to the problem in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
during their meeting in Prague on April 11-15. 
  Ataman said it is the second document signed after the Rome 
Agreement, adding that it is very important that free exchange 
of ideas can be held between representatives of conflicting 
sides. 
  He said that Armenia should give up its new offensive 
against 
Azerbaijan, which is a violation of UN, CSCE and other 
international norms. 
  Ataman renewed Turkey's support for Azerbaijan's violated 
territorial unity.

  [Text] Turkey's main opposition party, the Motherland Party 
[ANAP], has submitted a motion to the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly [TGNA] to hold a general debate on the latest 
developments regarding Cyprus. The motion refers to reports 
that during Prime Minister Ciller's recent visit to the United 
States, President Clinton pressured her in connection with the 
Cyprus question. ANAP said: It is inconceivable to accept such 
behavior, which means that our foreign policy is under foreign 
domination regarding a national issue such as Cyprus. The prime 
minister herself must urgently clarify this issue before the 
TGNA. 
  ANAP said the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], 
which has been living in peace for a long time, is recently 
being pushed toward chaos, step by step. It claimed that the 
debates being held at the United Nations are nothing but efforts 
to exert pressure on the TRNC delegation and Turkey. ANAP also 
charged that the government program does not pay enough 
attention to the issue of the TRNC.

  [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
described the downing of two helicopters belonging to Poised 
Hammer in northern Iraq and the martyring of three Turkish 
officers as another Saratoga incident. He said that the 
incident cannot be covered up. 
  Addressing his party's assembly group meeting, Erbakan 
remarked that the F-15 planes that downed the helicopters are 
equipped with instruments that determine the identity of the 
target, but it is clear that these were not used. Pointing out 
that Turkey also has the same helicopters, Erbakan claimed that 
the uncontrolled shooting enhances the possibility that the 
helicopters were believed to be Turkish. Erbakan said that the 
suspects in the Saratoga incident were not tried by Turkish 
courts and charged that the presence of a Turkish officer in the 
panel of judges was merely for show. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] We are experiencing the same thing 
in this second Saratoga incident. What is the problem? Let us 
summon the pilots of Poised Hammer, which is located in Turkey. 
Let us bring them here and question them in court on how they 
shot, what they shot. This is a requisite of an independent 
country. Moreover, it is the requisite of law an human decency. 
[end recording] 
  Erbakan claimed that Turkey is unable to play an active role 
in the face of the annihilation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Serbian 
hands. He declared that it must be known that no concessions can 
be made on the subjects of Bosnia or Cyprus.

<F P=106> [Report by Saygi Ozturk: "Syria: Abdullah Ocalan Is in </F>
Greece"--punctuation as published] 
  [Text] In view of Internal Affairs Minister Nahit Mentese's 
visit to Damascus, Syria is preparing to deal a new blow to the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. Syrian Internal Affairs 
Minister Muhammad Harbah has said: "We shall not allow the PKK 
to exist in our country. We shall uproot that organization 
together. 
  Harbah also said that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in 
Syria and that they have been informed that he is in Greece. 
According to the record on the talks Mentese and Harbah held, 
the two officials exchanged the following views: 
  Mentese: Turkey and Syria have favorable relations. Turkey 
wishes to maintain them. 
  Harbah: We wish to have our relations improved. 
Furthermore, we wish to bring to light all matters that have 
been in the dark until now. We must trust each other more. 
  Mentese: The Turkish officials are aware that the PKK's 
terrorist activities in Turkey are organized in Syria. We have 
reliable intelligence reports that confirm that state of 
affairs. We ask you not to allow the PKK to shelter in your 
country. 
  Harbah: We agree that the PKK was involved in various 
activities in Syria until 1992. However, our relations entered 
a new phase after then Internal Affairs Minister Ismet Sezgin 
visited Damascus on 17 April 1992. We favor friendship and 
fraternal relations between our two countries. 
  Mentese: That is exactly what Turkey wants. However, you 
must prove your friendship and fraternal relations. Here is a 
clipping from a newspaper. It says that PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan met with three Turkish journalists in Barr Ilyas, which 
is under Syria's control. That means that the PKK leader is in 
this region. 
  Harbah: The reports that PKK leaders are in our region are 
wrong. An effort is being made to create the impression that 
the leading PKK cadres are either in Syria or in the region we 
control in Lebanon in order to disrupt the relations between 
Syria and Turkey. 
  Mentese: We will give you other documents that confirm that 
Abdullah Ocalan is in this region. We will give you the 
addresses of several places and telephone numbers. We know that 
the leader of a terrorist organization cannot remain in the 
region without your being informed of his presence. That Ocalan 
is in the region is a strong possibility. 
  Harbah: We have received information that Ocalan is in 
Greece. We will definitely not allow the PKK to organize 
conferences or meet with journalists in Syria. We can guarantee 
that. 
  Mentese: The PKK is a threat to Turkey and the region. A 
part of Syria is included in the territory of the state the 
Kurdish organizations wish to establish. You will suffer as 
much as Turkey does. 
  Harbah: We are also worried about that. The establishment 
of a Kurdish state in the region would be as harmful for you as 
it would be for us. Syria's most fertile lands are included in 
the territory of the state they wish to establish. We support 
Turkey's territorial integrity. The political will in Syria 
supports Turkey's territorial integrity. Ethnic communities are 
a threat to Syria as much as they are to our neighbors. We will 
remove the PKK's roots together. 
  Mentese: The Turkish public and the media are very sensitive 
about the PKK problem. We have the right to expect our 
neighbors to maintain a similar approach. 
  Harbah: We are not satisfied with the Turkish newspapers. 
They publish reports against Syria. Do we not do anything 
positive? 
  Mentese: Freedom of the press exists in Turkey. We cannot 
interfere in their reports. That is out of the question. The 
documents discovered in the possession of several terrorists 
arrested in Silopi some time ago reveal that the PKK sent arms 
and rocket launchers to Turkey through Syria. We will give 
those documents to you. 
  Harbah: Not a single firearm can be transferred from one 
place to another in Syria without the government being informed. 
Nevertheless, what you have said will be investigated. 
  Nahit Mentese held talks with President al-Asad for three 
hours on the last day of his visit. Mentese explained the 
support the PKK and its leading members receive in Syria and 
stressed that the effort to improve the cooperation between 
Ankara and Damascus will be very useful for the two countries.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with National Defense Minister Mehmet </F>
Golhan by NOKTA correspondent Nedret Ersanel; place and date not 
given -- punctuation as published] 
  [Excerpts] [Ersanel] As far as your ministry is concerned, 
the question of military conscription is the subject that has 
most attracted the attention of the media. In fact, the 
argument on the situation of the students who attend the public 
education institutions continues. Have you begun to draft those 
students? They claim that, compared with the students who attend 
the other universities, they have been unjustly treated. 
  [Golhan] The laws have allowed a certain degree of freedom 
to 
us. A provision to postpone the conscription of the students 
who attend the public education institutions does not exist. 
Those who are not full-time students do not have the right to 
postpone their conscription. However, the Ministry of National 
Defense, considering the fact that a need for additional troops 
did not exist during the initial years of the AOF, allowed them 
to benefit from the rights of the students in the other 
universities. Actually, that was the right thing to do. 
However, the number of troops decreased in time. The number of 
those who avoided conscription and the number of absentees 
totaled 250,000 men. The argument that was made in the media on 
the matter in November 1993 provided for the conscription of 
30,000 men. We needed just under 210,000 men in February 1994. 
  We do not wish to draft the young men who attend the public 
education institutions when those who have avoided conscription 
continue to apply for military service. However, we have 
carried out some research that has revealed that 82,000 of the 
students who attend the public education institution failed to 
pass their classes in two years. That cannot be allowed. We 
have refrained from drafting them during the present call-up 
period. However, we may do so in August and November, starting 
with those who have repeatedly failed. The university colleges 
do not attach importance to the failure of their students 
because they have a budget to consider. We have not drafted 
those students at the present time, that is, except for those 
who have applied for military service. [passage omitted] 
  [Ersanel] Has there been a change in Turkey's "defense 
concept?" 
  [Golhan] Turkey's neighbors are arming themselves. 
Furthermore, they are trying to find and acquire nuclear arms. 
In view of that, we have to maintain the Turkish Armed Forces' 
strength at a certain level. Negative developments are taking 
place on each side of Turkey. We maintain the same priorities 
in our defense concept. I do not wish to mention the names of 
the countries that are trying to acquire nuclear arms. Turkey's 
southern neighbors are making an effort in that direction, 
however. None of them has acquired a nuclear weapon so far. 
However, there are those who have long-range missiles that can 
reach Ankara. So, we have to take measures against that state 
of affairs. 
  [Ersanel] Can you explain your viewpoint? 
  [Golhan] We cannot lag behind them. That is all I want to 
say. Those who covet our territory will adopt an aggressive 
policy if they realize that we do not have the necessary arms to 
deter an aggression. Let me say the following: Turkey is the 
strongest country in the region from the military point of view. 
What I have said does not apply to the question of missiles. 
We do not behave contrary to UN resolutions. 
  [Ersanel] Germany has again adopted a strong approach on the 
use of the arms it supplied to Turkey in southeastern 
Anatolia... Can you comment on that matter? 
  [Golhan] The problem is as follows: We have acquired arms 
and military equipment from Russia. They are very similar to 
those we have acquired from Germany. That has confused the 
foreign journalists who visited that region. They created an 
uproar by saying that the arms and military equipment they saw 
were supplied to Turkey by Germany. We received a letter from 
the German minister of defense today (Friday) [15 April]. He 
only thanked us and said nothing else. We will acquire arms 
from Germany within the framework of the agreement on 
cooperation in the defense industry domain. He informed us that 
he will support Turkey. We also received a similar message from 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Nevertheless, he has made 
several statements accusing Turkey of using the arms it has 
acquired from Germany. His statements have been prompted by the 
large number of Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] sympathizers in 
Germany, PKK's friendly relations with the press organs in that 
country, and other possible material gains. Of course, we also 
have to consider the elections that will be held in Germany in 
the near future. 
  The German officials accused us in the past of using the 
arms 
we acquire from Germany against the Kurdish people. They have 
now demanded that we must not "use those arms" against the PKK 
either. Alright, let us not do so... We have others that we can 
use. We can use the arms we have acquired from the United 
States and Russia. 
  [Ersanel] The United States has recently mentioned the 
concept of a "political solution" to the Kurdish problem in 
various meetings, particularly in those which have been held in 
Turkey... You have attended those meetings. In fact, you held 
talks with the U.S. officials on the matter last Thursday. Can 
you explain what the United States and the Western countries 
mean by their reference to a "political solution?" 
  [Golhan] We heard the former People's Labor Party deputies 
call for a "political and democratic solution" two years ago. 
They then joined the Democratic Party. What do they mean by 
that solution? They mean to say that the "military forces cannot 
impose a solution." Then they should explain the solution they 
call for.... Unfortunately, such a solution does not exist.... 
The meaning behind the call for a political solution, in other 
words, the meaning behind the solution called for by our 
colleagues, is the establishment of either a separate and 
independent Kurdish state or the establishment of a federation 
in Turkey. In fact, that is also the meaning behind the "hints" 
that have been made by various officials. Yes, the meaning can 
be stretched right up to that point. However, how can that be 
justified when free elections are held in Turkey and people are 
free to trade, do business, and settle and work in any part of 
the country they like? Has anyone gotten in trouble for 
speaking Kurdish? 
  [Ersanel] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman 
also mentioned the concept of a political solution in the 
past.... That means that what the U.S. officials have in mind 
is no different from what you have explained. 
  [Golhan] Yes, what they mean is no different from what I 
have 
outlined. I met U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles 
Freeman on Thursday. He said: "The PKK is definitely a 
terrorist organization. Europe will eventually realize that." 
  [Ersanel] Has he explained what a political solution means? 
  [Golhan] No. The objective behind the concept of a political 
solution is the establishment of a federation.... That is my 
sincere viewpoint.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that the 
coming days will be a turning point in the fight against 
terrorism, and she called on the terrorists to surrender before 
the arrival of summer. Ciller also condemned the Serbian 
massacre of defenseless Bosnians, calling it the most 
disgraceful event in the history of humanity. The prime minister 
called on all concerned nations and international organizations 
to fulfill their responsibilities urgently and with 
determination to stop this human tragedy. 
  In a speech she delivered at the True Path Party's assembly 
meeting, Ciller discussed the fight against terrorism, the new 
radio and television law, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and her recent visit to the United States. 
  Ciller stressed that the fight against terrorism is 
continuing as planned and in determination. The prime minister 
noted that great success was achieved during the intense 
operations concentrated around Agri and Tendurek Mountains 
during the last week. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] We had previously announced that a 
turning point regarding this issue would be reached during the 
summer months and this plan is continuing successfully -- with 
determination -- and it will be written in history as the 
victory of the 50th government, with the True Path Party as its 
major partner. [applause] 
  Dear friends, nowadays, dissolution and disintegration has 
started amid the terrorists. We know that, within this 
framework, the terrorists are conducting propaganda directed at 
the young people and I would like to convey once more how wrong 
this is. The propaganda advises not to surrender to the 
security forces because they will be maltreated. This is 
definitely wrong. I am once more calling on these young people: 
The end of this road is distress. We are determined to 
eradicate terrorism. Let the lives of these young people be 
spared within this determination to eliminate terrorism. Let 
them come and surrender themselves to the state. The state will 
show affection to them. The state will embrace them and be just 
toward them. [end recording] 
  Expressing her views on the law regulating radio and 
television broadcasts, Ciller said that the aim of the law is 
not to restrict broadcasts but rather to prevent broadcasts 
which may harm public order and the country's peace and 
security. Ciller explained that legal procedures similar to 
the one adopted in Turkey exist in all Western countries. 
Ciller said: Nowhere does the freedom of press and speech 
imply encouraging acts of incitement, which disturb the 
indivisible integrity and independence of the state as well as 
the tranquillity and security of the people. 
  Ciller called the Serbian massacre of defenseless Bosnians 
the most disgraceful incident in the history of mankind. Ciller 
said these developments, which are exhausting the world's 
patience, are also harming the confidence in the United Nations 
and NATO, adding that Turkey is taking all necessary initiatives 
on the issue. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I am calling on all the world as I 
have done from Tuzla: I am calling on all concerned nations and 
international organizations to fulfill their duties urgently and 
with determination to end the human tragedy in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and to save the crushed human pride. These 
people have a right to self defense. The least that can be 
done, if NATO and the United Nations are incapable of fulfilling 
their duties, is the lifting of the embargo, and I am urging 
once again that this step, at least, will be implemented 
urgently. [end recording] 
  At the conclusion of her speech, Ciller briefed the party 
members on her recent visit to the United States. Ciller said 
that the real aim of her visit was to participate in the meeting 
held by the Elie Wiesel Foundation. Stating that lately there 
have been unjust allegations as to Turkey violating human rights 
spreading in Europe and the United States, Ciller said that all 
efforts in all forums will be exerted to prevent these rumors, 
which have intensified especially after the immunities of 
certain deputies were lifted. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] How do other countries react when 
somebody arrives with another flag at the assembly; when there 
is an attempt to take an oath in another language, outside the 
official language; and when the contents of the oath are being 
changed? What actions were taken in Belgium? In France? How 
does the United States react to such a situation? I was happy 
to see that when asked these questions, the answers were: We 
would have done the same thing. However, we did not do the same 
thing. We really did not do anything when these incidents were 
taking place. Our determination regarding this issue and the 
step we took in the assembly were undertaken in an environment 
open to offensive proclamations by authorized persons and 
institutions. The steps we took came after these persons, who 
are accused of meeting with terrorists in the houses allocated 
to the deputies, were charged with cooperating with murderers 
and criminals. For that reason, our cause is just and we will 
continue to explain our side. I am glad to see that the more we 
explain the situation the more the realities are crystallizing. 
[end recording] 
  Ciller said that during her visit to the United States she 
had an opportunity to meet with the U.S. President Clinton and 
discuss with him important foreign developments -- primarily 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Explaining that within this framework, she 
also had an opportunity to explain to Clinton the economic 
stability program, Ciller said that the U.S. Administration 
expressed its open political support for the economic package. 
However, Ciller continued, the IMF and the World Bank did not 
influence the 5 April decisions. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] We made these decisions not to gain 
the support of the IMF or the World Bank. We made these 
decisions to be independent from them, because we believe they 
are needed for the Turkish people's prosperity, before 
unemployment spreads all over the country and people are laid 
off en masse, before inflation reaches 4,000 or 5,000 percent, 
and before the vicious circle in the economy becomes irrevocable. 
  I would like to say openly and with utmost sincerity that 
these decisions would have been taken regardless of the IMF and 
regardless of the World Bank support. These decisions were 
reached not because the IMF or the World Bank wanted but because 
they were needed for the prosperity of the Turkish people and 
were taken independent of them. However, I was glad to see that 
these organizations are supporting these economic measures. 
This is very gratifying for us, because in this way we will be 
able to reintegrate with the world money markets as well as 
revive the credit mechanism which was getting disconnected. 
[end recording] 
  Ciller added that they will solve the issues left to the 
50th 
government, and which are the result of years of errors, 
undaunted and with determination.

<F P=106> [Report by Turan Yavuz: "Conclude a Stand-By Agreement and </F>
Get the Cash" --punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Washington--The possibility of a stand-by [previous 
word in English] agreement between the IMF and Turkey during the 
next few weeks has almost been agreed upon. Ambassador Volkan 
Vural, adviser to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who has been 
having preliminary contacts in Washington prior to the prime 
minister's visit on Friday [14 April], ascertained IMF's 
inclination on the matter during the talks he held with IMF 
Deputy Chairman Russo yesterday. In addition to Volkan Vural, 
Emre Gonensay, presidential adviser on economic matters; Necati 
Ozfirat, under secretary of the Turkish Planning Organization; 
and Bulent Ozgun, head of the Directorate of Foreign Trade, are 
among the members of the Turkish delegation to the United States. 
  The question of Turkey's urgent need for new credits was the 
focal point in the Turkish delegation's talks with the IMF and 
World Bank officials. They mostly focused on the possibility of 
new financial resources for Turkey. Russo informed the 
delegation that the IMF is prepared to extend new credits to 
Turkey, saying that the conclusion of a stand-by agreement 
between the two sides will facilitate the credits. 
  Meanwhile, Thomas Wiens, one of the deputy chairmen of the 
World Bank group in which Turkey is included, informed Volkan 
Vural that a request by the Ciller government for new financial 
resources can be considered within the framework of an agreement 
between the World Bank and Turkey. 
  The officials in Washington are convinced that Ciller will 
launch an initiative with the World Bank and the IMF on Friday 
aimed at persuading them to extend new credits to Turkey. A 
World Bank official, who prefered to remain anonymous, has 
informed MILLIYET as follows: "Turkey has two options at the 
present time. It will either find a short-term credit with high 
interest, which I believe will be very difficult to get, or it 
will conclude a stand-by agreement with the IMF and the World 
Bank. That will enable Turkey to get a credit that can be 
repaid without difficulty. There is no alternative." 
  It has been reported that Prime Minister Ciller will try to 
secure a credit of $5 billion in New York and Washington. 
However, it has been ascertained that a stand-by agreement 
with, for example, the IMF, will only provide a credit of "$300 
million or $400 million for Turkey. 
  Ambassador Vural and his delegation also held talks with 
Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman, who is responsible 
for European affairs. They discussed matters that concern the 
relations between the two countries in general and tried to 
establish the agenda of the meeting President Clinton will have 
with Prime Minister Ciller probably on Friday. Drawing 
attention to the economic situation in Turkey, Vural explained 
the Ciller Government's "urgent need for financial resources" 
and urged the Clinton administration to support Turkey. 
Furthermore, Vural suggested that a certain amount of cash from 
the Turkey-U.S. Defense Fund be transferred to Ankara without 
being linked to any project. However, U.S. officials refrained 
from responding favorably to his suggestion. 
  The Ciller government is very interested in the U.S. 
Eximbank 
Fund for $5 billion, which the Clinton administration disclosed 
in December 1993. Although the existence of that fund has been 
used as propaganda material in domestic politics in Turkey, a 
U.S. official said: "The United States benefits from that fund 
more than Turkey does. It is a fund that facilitates the sale 
of U.S. products on a unilateral basis. That gives an 
opportunity to U.S. businessmen to make profits." 
  Stephen Oxman responded to Vural's request for financial 
resources as follows: "We want to help Ankara particularly at a 
difficult time for Turkey. However, we are also in a difficult 
situation. Meanwhile, we have to make recourse to the U.S. 
Congress on such matters. The congressmen will immediately 
respond by raising the question of human rights, the Cyprus 
issue, and the Kurdish problem. Securing approval for cash aid 
or financial resources for Turkey will be easier if progress is 
made on those matters." 
  The chilly approach the Clinton administration, the IMF, and 
the World Bank have adopted on Turkey's request for financial 
aid, particularly IMF's insistence on a stand-by agreement, has 
undermined the chances of Ciller's visit to the United States 
being successful.

  [Text] ANAP [Motherland Party] leader Mesut Yilmaz said the 
the public is being given the impression that the meetings with 
the IMF are successful. He added that agreement with the IMF is 
like sharing the state's economic sovereignty with an 
international corporation. 
  At his party's assembly meeting, Yilmaz said that the 
information communicated to the public regarding Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller's visit to the United States is unsatisfactory. 
Indicating that the public is being given the impression that 
the visit was very successful, Yilmaz added that the contents of 
this success are not clarified. Asserting that the real aim of 
this visit was to procure foreign financial support for the 
stability measures, Yilmaz claimed that there can be no mention 
of a basic feasibility package and added that there is an 
attempt to camouflage the package with an IMF cloak. 
  Yilmaz indicated that Turkey faces a heavy price because the 
coalition government did not take the necessary measures in 
time. Indicating that Turkey had $7 billion worth of foreign 
currency in the Central Bank in November 1993, Yilmaz said that 
today there are no foreign currencies Turkey can make use of in 
the Central Bank. 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] The election wasted $7 billion in 
six months. Now, the total credit the prime minister with her 
large delegation and with her numerous meetings obtained is $640 
million. $640 million is the amount allocated to Turkey and we 
cannot obtain this amount at one time. We can only withdraw the 
money as long as we implement the measures and the IMF approves 
of them step by step. [end recording] 
  Yilmaz stressed that the United Nations and NATO are 
incapacitated regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yilmaz stated that 
UN secretary general should immediately resign in case Gorazde, 
which is under the protection of the United Nations, is captured 
by the Serbs. 
  Recalling the announcement that compulsory savings will be 
refunded, Yilmaz said that it is not right that a small amount 
will be paid to those that have contributed continually for six 
years. Explaining that the tax bill is not just, Yilmaz said 
that 6 million people are outside the tax bracket and 3 million 
people are overtaxed. Yilmaz noted that the results of all the 
measures is 200 trillion Turkish lira [TL] and added that the 
state lost much more than TL200 trillion with the devaluation 
and the rise in the rate of interest. 
  Expressing their worries that all the sacrifices will be in 
vain, Yilmaz said that without controlling the rate of interest 
and foreign currency, public debt will not be reduced.

  [Text] Ankara, April 20 (AA) -- Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese said today that a new organization named the

  During a meeting of the parliament's interior commission, 
Mentese said that police were working under great risk and are 
revealing many incidents. 
  Mentese said that the `Resalvation Union' was revealed when 
police teams Tuesday [19 April] caught five members of the 
organization, five minutes before their attempt to rob a bank in 
the Zeytinburnu township of Istanbul.

  [Text] Ankara, April 20 (TANJUG) -- The bomb which on 
Tuesday [19 April] blew up the car of the first secretary of the 
embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] in Turkey 
outside his residence in the Turkish capital was planted by an 
Islamic terrorist organization called the Great Eastern Islamic 
Conquering Front (IBDA), the paper MEJDAN wrote on Wednesday. 
  It quoted Ankara's deputy security chief as saying that the 
organization had claimed responsibility for the assault in 
letters to several media houses and that the group had so far 
been unknown for similar activities. 
  After the incident, the Turkish police stepped up security 
measures around the Yugoslav Embassy. 
  Reacting to the attack, Charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav 
Embassy in Ankara Bojan Bugarcic lodged a protest note to the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry. 
  Bugarcic on Tuesday told TANJUG that the Yugoslav Embassy 
had 
repeatedly informed the Turkish authorities that security 
measures around the embassy were not sufficient and pointed out 
that it was the duty of the Turkish Government, as the host, to 
provide full protection of all diplomatic and consular offices. 
  The Yugoslav Government on Tuesday lodged u strong protest 
note to Turkey over the terrorist attack and pointed out that 
the perpetrators of the criminal act had been encouraged by the 
continuing and organized anti-Yugoslav and anti-Serbian campaign 
of the Turkish media and unacceptible statements by Turkish 
officials aimed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
the Serbian people. 
  In the protest note, which the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry 
handed to the charge d'affaires of the Turkish Embassy in 
Belgrade, the Turkish Government is asked to discover and punish 
the perpetrators of the terrorist act, pay compensation for the 
damage to property, take all necessary steps for full protection 
of the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular offices and guarantee 
the safety of their personnel and the members of their families 
in Turkey, in keeping with the provisions of the Vienna 
convention on diplomatic relations and other international 
documents.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "What Did Erbakan Really Try to </F>
Say?"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday [20 April] pro-Islamic Welfare Party 
(RP) Chairman Professor Necmettin Erbakan made some "historical" 
statements which could well be quoted by future generations as a 
pretext for a military intervention in Turkey. 
  Even his own party people did not understand why the veteran 
politician suddenly went off the track and described the 
incidents in Ankara and Istanbul over the weekend as an Islamic 
"uprising," nor his threat that sooner or later his party would 
come to power to establish a "just order" in Turkey and that 
people should either accept the transition from the current 
system to the "just order" peacefully or through blood. There 
was a wide range of speculations on why Erbakan, also known as 
the "hodja" [Muslim teacher], decided to make such remarks. 
Some well-respected Islamic intellectuals felt Erbakan's 
statements were a blatant provocation and that the RP chairman 
was serving certain Western interests who are trying to belittle 
the cause of Islam in Turkey. 
  Erbakan had said: "If you do not accept the election results 
(the fact that the Welfare had won the municipal polls) then 
people will rise up as we saw during the weekend." It seems the 
hodja misses the point that while his party won 19.5 percent of 
the votes, 80.5 percent of the voters did not vote for the 
Welfare and thus rejected his program. That means a great 
majority of the people are not in favor of these pro-Islamic 
policies. 
  If his so-called uprising means the minority wants to rule 
the majority then Erbakan will be in for a great surprise. We 
do not think Turkey experienced an uprising at the weekend. 
What started as a government approved protest by 
ultranationalists in Bosnia-Herzegovina got out of hand in 
Ankara and Istanbul as some radical Islam activists infiltrated 
the ranks of the demonstrators and tried to exploit the 
situation. Actually they were successful to a certain extent 
and the security forces were caught off guard. 
  Erbakan has attracted the fury of everyone, both among the 
pro-Islamic supporters in Turkey, the moderates and even the 
radicals. 
  We feel the Welfare should not get carried away with its 
success at the municipal elections. As we mentioned before, 
this is not a grand victory but a relative achievement for a 
religiously orientated party. If they feel they can capitalize 
on the boost they received at the elections by taking to the 
streets as a show of force they will soon see how mistaken they 
are. 
  What Erbakan and his colleagues should be doing now is to 
reconcile their differences with the masses in Turkey and prove 
they are an integral part of the Republican order. That way 
they can put an end to the dangerous polarization of the 
"believers" and the "nonbelievers" and create an atmosphere of 
brotherhood in Turkey. Talking of blood and uprisings is not the 
way to do this because then the silent masses, who are believers 
but who are also secularist, will feel obliged to deal a heavy 
blow to the fanatics who think they can turn Turkey into a 
Muslim fundamentalist state.

<F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood article: "Delors Vows To Ruin Hurd </F>
Deal on EC Voting"] 
  [Text] The President of the European Commission [EC], M 
Jacques Delors, vowed yesterday to use all his powers to render 
worthless the limited concessions Britain obtained in the row 
over voting rights. 
  In a debate last month, the Prime Minister staked much of 
his 
credibility on defending the compromise negotiated by Mr Douglas 
Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, saying it would protect British 
interests. 
  But yesterday, M Delors told the European Parliament that, 
given his "constant concern to strengthen the decisionmaking of 
the Union and its capacity for action" and the fact that he had 
opposed the compromise, he had "embarked on a damage-limitation 
exercise." He declared that the compromise agreement "is 
political declaration, not legal text" and that the Commission 
retained the power to declare that the "reasonable period" for 
delaying decisions had been exhausted. 
  To force a vote to go through, with the blocking minority at 
27, would require the support of only half the EC members. In 
the circumstances, that would be an easy proposition. 
  He also stressed that the British concession will only last 
until voting procedures are reviewed in 1996. 
  M Delors fears any attempt by Britain to slowdown EC 
decisionmaking. 
  Britain lost its battle to freeze the number of votes 
required to block EC decisions at 23 when the EC is enlarged 
with the addition of four new members next year. 
  The "blocking minority" will rise to 27, thus making it 
harder for Britain to block EC decisions. 
  But, as a sop to the British, the EC agreed that, in cases 
where 23 votes are mustered against a proposal but not the full 
27, there will be a "reasonable delay" while consensus is sought. 
  Even this minimal concession has annoyed federalist-minded 
Euro-MPs, many of whom may vote against the treaty admitting 
Finland, Austria, Sweden and Norway to the EC because of it. 
For them, any widening of the EC must be accompanied by 
"deepening" -- further integration -- to prevent the wheels of 
the Community from seizing up. Enough of these MEPs [Member of 
the European Parliament] may oppose the enlargement treaty, or 
abstain, to prevent it from going through, and the EC is 
embarked on an attempt to persuade them to vote positively on 
May 4.

<F P=106> [Report by Axel Florijn: "All We Could Do Was Watch Them </F>
Slaughter Each Other -- Colleagues of Murdered Paratroopers 
Burning Their Blue Helmets"] 
  [Text] Ninety paratroopers of the 3d Unit from Tielen, and 
51st Mounted Chasseurs from Arnsberg, which took part in the 
evacuation operation Silver Back in Rwanda, landed in Melsbroek 
yesterday on two Boeing 727's. There were also 43 disappointed 
UN blue helmets from the 2d Unit from Flawinne aboard. Out of 
helpless anger over the murder of 10 companions on 7 April by 
the Rwandan army, some of them tore up or burned their blue 
helmets on the spot. 
  "This was the most dangerous of the four missions I 
accomplished in Africa," Corporal Ronny Van Sey (39) of the 3d 
Unit from Tielen said. "When we arrived at Kigali, we went 
through several hours of suspense. The landing had been 
refused, and we knew from the French paratroopers that nine 
Rwandan antiaircraft batteries were positioned along the runway. 
We circled around for an hour or so, but there was no doubt 
about the assignment: To `protect' the Kigali airport by force, 
if necessary. We were heavily armed. I was in the first C-130 
which landed in Kigali. The Rwandans understood that we meant 
business, and backed off." 
<H5>  No Use </H5>
  The mortar attack on the airport Thursday [14 April] last 
week, was a second moment of suspense. "During the withdrawal 
toward Nairobi, mortars fell close to the hangar. One mortar 
fell right behind a C-130. My company covered their retreat. 
At such a moment, one falls back on one's training, and fires 
automatically. Afterwards, everything remained quiet. No shot 
was fired near the airport on Sunday. I don't think that the 
men who stayed behind to guard the control tower, will have any 
trouble. The Rwandans know that we won't be kicked around." 
  "Horrible. Never again in these circumstances," UN blue 
helmet Hussein Benbouhout (27) shouted against the noise of the 
airplane engines. "Those 10 murdered paratroopers were friends. 
They gave their lives for a useless peacekeeping mission. They 
were powerless against a gang of murdering Rwandan soldiers. 
Insane. I never want to go through this again," he said. 
  The sergeant of the 2d Unit from Flawinne hardly controlled 
his emotions. "We arrived at Kigali on 14 March. We guarded 
the cooperation assistants near the Don Bosco school, and 
prepared their evacuation. We drove through the city several 
times to pick up fellow Belgians. I was always in the first 
vehicle, because I have no family, no children. I am not scared 
to fight either, this is what I was trained for." 
  He lashed out again: "But we were not allowed to shoot. We 
might just as well have left our weapons at Don Bosco. My heart 
was pounding at each roadblock. The blacks constantly pointed 
their guns at us. Some of them gestured that they would cut our 
throats with their machetes. We were only allowed to react in 
self-defense. Which is no use against a bullet in the back or a 
machete in your throat. Training is of no use then." 
  "What can you do when you are surrounded by 50 blacks, when 
one of them presses the barrel of his gun against your chest? 
Three of us were guarding a Rwandan lawyer in Kigali. Five 
minutes after we left, he was slaughtered," Corporal Fabien 
Vanhee (30) of the 2d Unit from Flawinne said, shrugging his 
shoulders. This was my second mission in Africa. "All we could 
do, was watch people slaughter each other like animals," he said 
in a flat voice. 
  Colonel Walter Balis (52) was liaison officer for the UN 
with 
the "rebels." "Fortunately, we lived under the permanent 
protection of the rebels. They protected us against the 
massacres of the presidential guard and of Interahamwe, a 
militia of former President Habyarimana's united party MRND 
[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]. 
We were hoping that the so-called rebels would conquer Kigali 
as quickly as possible, and end the `beastly actions.'"

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government welcomed the 
"firm stand" adopted by U.S. President Bill Clinton regarding 
the situation in the Bosnian town of Gorazde. Government 
spokesman Dieter Vogel said in Bonn today that military and 
economic measures against the continued aggression by Serb 
combat troops are among "the allies' options to make the Serb 
leadership see reason." 
  Vogel added that close political cooperation is needed 
between the European Union and NATO as well as the United 
Nations, the United States, and Russia to achieve this. This 
would allow "maximum pressure" to be exerted on the Serb 
leadership. The German Government therefore welcomes Clinton's 
expressed intention to work in close coordination particularly 
with Russia to prepare the ground for further measures.

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Donato Bendicenti] </F>
  [Excerpts] Now we turn to politics. Negotiations between 
the members of the Freedom Alliance are becoming very lively. 
Last night the Alliance held its first meeting since the 
election of the parliamentary speakers. Donato Bendicenti 
reports: 
  [Bendicenti] [Passage omitted] Roberto Maroni from the 
Northern League said that he was willing to talk about 
increasing the Freedom Alliance's majority in the Senate. 
  [Begin Maroni recording] I said that we ought to find an 
agreement with Mario Segni's Pact for Italy and with individual 
parliamentarians. I do not think that we should be looking for 
political alliances with the Italian Popular Party. It seems to 
me that this view is also shared by the leaders of the Pact for 
Italy so we are in agreement on this point. [passage omitted] 
[end recording] 
  [Bendicenti] Finally Silvio Berlusconi arrived. Some 
speculated that his late arrival was due to a secret meeting 
with Mario Segni. However, this was denied by Berlusconi. 
  [Begin recording] [Berlusconi] This is not true. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So you did not meet Mario 
Segni? 
  [Berlusconi] No. I heard that he had said some things, but 
there is nothing that concerns our relations with Segni. He is 
asking and replying to his own questions. [passage omitted] 
[end recording] 
  [Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center 
shown on video being interviewed by correspondent Fulvio Damiani] 
  [Begin recording] [Damiani] The relationship between the 
Freedom Alliance and the opposition parties -- are there going 
to be new developments? Tomorrow the voting for the deputy 
speakers of the parliamentary chambers will take place. How 
will you face up to this relationship? Is the relationship one 
of opposition, or will the Freedom Alliance be holding out a 
hand to the opposition? 
  [Casini] We are holding out two hands, but not to individual 
parliamentarians because this is the logic of old-style 
politics. We are holding out a hand to other political 
groupings, particularly the Italian Popular Party. There are 
two opposition slates in parliament: one which is antagonistic, 
that of the Left and the Progressive Alliance, and the other is 
an opposition with which we have much in common. However, the 
Italian Popular Party must reply to these signals. These 
signals are political and allow them to differentiate their 
position from that of the left. 
  [Damiani] How are the plans for the government going along? 
It is said that certain names have already been mentioned in 
relation to certain ministries? Is this true? 
  [Casini] Some ministries already have names attached to 
them, 
but the problem is not that of names but of policies. It is 
precisely in policy issues that we in the Christian Democratic 
Center are posing some problems, although of course each party 
poses its own problems. The government must not be a sort of 
boat that just floats; it must instead be sure of planning a 
long and calm journey. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The replies of the Italian Popular Party and 
Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, which is scheduled to hold a 
meeting very shortly with regard to the invitations of the 
Freedom Alliance, are still negative. The Italian Popular Party 
has reiterated its decision to remain in opposition. Mario 
Segni has also ruled out supporting the new government. He said 
that the Pact's opposition would be firm, but not full of 
prejudice and closed like that of the Party of the Democratic 
Left.

<F P=106> [Report by Marino de Medici: "Gorazde: Massacre Away From </F>
Television Cameras"] 
  [Text] Washington -- The American television big shots, 
protected by their bulletproof vests, and the television cameras 
focusing with frightening clarity on the destruction and 
suffering caused by the Serbs' weapons were nowhere to be seen 
in Gorazde. 
  Gorazde fell in the worst possible way, with a tragic 
admission of importance [as published] by the United Nations and 
the United States, and a victory for the Serbs which is not only 
strategic but also psychological. The American public saw no 
roads spattered with blood, did not hear the heart-rending cries 
of maimed children, and felt no compassion for the civilians 
prey to despair, as in Sarajevo. The White House was spared the 
embarrassment of having to respond in some way to yet another 
wave of denouncements and an angry appeal to "do something." A 
group of Americans has accused Clinton of having declared 
"neutrality in the presence of another massacre." For their 
part, television news programs reported the fall of Gorazde and 
the conclusions being drawn from the Serbs' display of military 
and political might -- first and foremost, the fact that the 
United Nations cannot do anything in Bosnia without the Serbs' 
cooperation. 
  In the absence of another cry of pain from the vast mass of 
Americans, the Clinton administration can now devote itself to 
salvaging what little there is still to salvage in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Indeed, the choice between capitulation and 
a more intensive bombardment campaign now seems to have 
disappeared. Beset, as he is, by domestic problems and by the 
Whitewater affair, the Democratic President cannot take the risk 
of a strategy of further limited and therefore ineffective 
interventions, which would open up a new front of broad 
disagreement within the United States. Indeed, Clinton and his 
advisers are particularly worried about a strong current of 
rebellion on the part of those who cannot accept Butrus-Ghali's 
acting on behalf of the United States. In fact it was the 
administration itself that gave this impression when it defended 
the attacks on the Serb positions as a measure designed to 
protect UN personnel. In fact the objective of the bombardments 
was to halt the offensive of the Serbs, who are determined to 
achieve their ends by means of brute force and ethnic cleansing. 
But Clinton did not have the courage to say so openly. 
  If America's strategy had ever contemplated the possibility 
of intervention, Washington should have prepared some time ago 
to send a contingent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a move now 
would condemn the Clinton administration. For his part, 
Butrus-Ghali reached the conclusion some time ago that without a 
leading U.S. role, the UN operations in the former Yugoslavia 
will be very inconclusive.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Calls For Independent Basque </F>
Country"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] Chairman 
Xabier Arzalluz stated yesterday that he wants independence for 
the Basque Country, although he does "not expect to see it." 
  In statements made to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company 
network, the PNV's top leader said that the Basque people could 
win this independence if they wished, "but I am a Basque 
nationalist, and there are people here -- in the Basque Country 
-- who are not nationalists, and what I believe is that what we 
win should be won by a clear majority." 
  Arzalluz showed himself in favor of a "Basque state within 
Europe," although he admitted that this is impossible right now, 
because there is the Army, which guarantees "that there will be 
no dismemberment of what is called national territory." 
  He referred to Article 8 of the Constitution, which assigns 
to the Armed Forces the task of guaranteeing Spain's sovereignty 
and independence and defending its territorial integrity and 
constitutional order, maintaining that it "is unpresentable." 
  In his opinion, the reactions to his speech on Aberri Eguna 
[Basque Fatherland Day] last Sunday, in which he criticized this 
article and described Spain's unity as "a story," are due not to 
a misinterpretation but to a manipulation, and added that the 
Basque people "have no chance of deciding freely." 
<H5>  Resignation </H5>
  Xabier Arzalluz said that civil governor of Vizcaya Daniel 
Arranz should resign for linking his Aberri Eguna statements 
with Monday's attack, and stated that following the things that 
were said, there was a need for a clarification by Interior 
Minister Antoni Asuncion along the lines of the one made 
Tuesday, which dissociated Arzalluz and the PNV from the 
strategy of Basque Homeland and Liberty. 
  "Asuncion is an intelligent man and knows what is at issue, 
but 24 hours elapsed before Asuncion spoke, and very grave 
things were said here, and the matter of Article 8 of the 
Constitution is the least of it," he said. 
  The nationalist leader said that the harsh reaction by the 
PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to his Aberri Eguna 
speech did not surprise him, and added that Ramon Jauregui and 
Mario Onaindia began the argument with its partners in the 
Basque government. 
  "We are now arguing with the PSOE, but the grave argument 
was 
begun systematically by Mr. Jauregui, backed by Mr. Onaindia; it 
is they who have led us to this situation." 
  In this connection, he added that Ramon Jauregui, 
"accompanied by Mr. Onaindia, is the man who is stirring up 
many things here because of his obsession with the elections." 
He also criticized the Basque Socialists for acting in 
accordance with Madrid's instructions. "What they do comes by 
fax from Madrid. They govern from there to here," he said. 
  The PNV chairman stated that the Socialists have already 
begun the Basque election campaign, and forecast that there will 
be no major changes: "It can be taken as an article of faith," 
he stated, "that the PNV will rise, Jauregui -- the Basque 
Socialists' secretary general -- will fall, and the People's 
Party will rise." 
  He acknowledged that the future Basque government was not 
discussed during his recent meeting with People's Party Chairman 
Jose Maria Aznar. 
  "If the government partner here -- the PSOE -- is presuming 
that it can talk with everybody," he said, "and holds talks with 
Eusko Alkartasuna [Basque Solidarity] or with Mayor Oreja -- 
leader of the People's Party in the Basque Country -- which are 
overt, moreover, saying that there can be many formulas, and 
covertly even with Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party], you 
will understand that we also feel free to talk openly with 
anybody." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirella Kalostipi from Washington </F>
-- live] 
  [Text] Good evening from Washington. Before discussing the 
details of meetings Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias held at 
the U.S. State Department, I must say that the minister's 
scheduled meeting with Anthony Lake, the U.S. presidential 
adviser on national security issues, was canceled. The reason 
is that the U.S. National Security Council is conferring today 
after U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to escalate attacks 
against Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So Lake probably 
had no time to meet Papoulias. 
  The foreign minister went to the State Department at around 
1030 to meet Warren Christopher, his counterpart; Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; and Matthew Nimetz, the U.S. 
presidential envoy to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, FYROM]. Answering a question before meeting 
Papoulias, Christopher said: The United States does not intend 
to ask Greece to lift the measures against Skopje unilaterally. 
At least this will not happen before international mediator 
Cyrus Vance and Nimetz conclude their mediation efforts. He 
added that Greece will decide whether to lift the measures. 
Christopher clarified that there is no disagreement on this 
issue between the State Department and the White House. There 
have been rumors that the State Department is pressing the White 
House to put pressure on Greece to lift the measures against 
Skopje. 
  The U.S. secretary of state said that according to Nimetz's 
report, the differences between Greece and the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [as heard] appear to be diminishing. 
Christopher said he hopes the parties can reach a preliminary 
agreement that will lead to lifting the embargo. This is 
important because essentially Christopher expressed the hope 
that the talks would proceed according to the procedure proposed 
by Greece. 
  After meeting Christopher, Papoulias was asked about this 
issue. He expressed very reserved optimism, saying that no 
significant progress has been achieved. He explained to 
Christopher the Greek Government's positions on smoothing 
Athens-Skopje relations. The foreign minister said he did not 
ask the United States to postpone establishing diplomatic 
relations with Skopje, adding that the United States must 
intervene to break Skopje's intransigence. He stressed that the 
efforts continue. Papoulias will meet Vance in New York on 
Monday morning [25 April]. 
  Papoulias and Christopher discussed the Bosnian crisis, the 
Cyprus issue, Greek-Turkish relations, and Greek-Albanian 
relations. Afterward, Papoulias met Nimetz and discussed Skopje. 
He also explained the Greek side's great concerns about 
incidents in Fanari. 
  Papoulias left open the possibility of Greece taking 
additional measures against Albania, over and above the 
demarches that have already been made to Van der Stoel, the CSCE 
high commissioner on human rights, and the UN Security Council. 
On his way to the State Department, Papoulias said that we are 
not discussing the deportation of Albanians. In a statement he 
made yesterday, referring to the arrests of Greek minority 
members by the Albanian authorities, Papoulias expressed the 
Greek Government's rage and said that every step will be taken 
to defend the Greek minority's internationally respected human 
rights. 
  Papoulias and Christopher discussed Greek-Albanian relations 
in the context of respect for the minority's human rights. 
Papoulias said later that he asked the United States to 
intervene so that human rights in Albania are respected.

  [Text] Ankara, April 20 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said today that to prevent further deaths in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
should make a decision promptly. 
  Ataman told a weekly press conference that the UN secretary 
general had authorized the alliance to carry out air strikes not 
only to protect Gorazde, but Zepa, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Bihac and 
Sarajevo. 
  "Even though it's late, we regard this initiative as a 
positive and useful step," Ataman said. 
  Ataman pointed out that UN Resolutions 824 and 836 had 
empowered the UN secretary general to make such a demand. 
  "An urgent initiative to be taken by NATO in line with this 
call is necessary to protect the organization's respectability, 
effectiveness and deterrence," he concluded.

  [Text] London, April 21 (AFP) -- European leaders Thursday 
[21 April] welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's stand on 
Bosnia as Moscow announced a joint U.S.-Russian proposal for an 
international summit on the crisis. 
  In Washington, the White House Thursday declined to confirm 
reports that Clinton and Yeltsin had agreed to hold an 
international summit on Bosnia. 
  But London and Paris both welcomed the call for a summit, 
also slated to include leaders of the European Union, the UN and 
parties to the Bosnian war. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman however expressed caution, 
saying: 
We "do not rule out a high-level meeting if it is going to 
advance the peace process, but we need careful preparation and 
clear objectives." 
  In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand expressed 
satisfaction over the proposed conference which he said should 
be held as soon as possible considering the urgency of the 
situation, his spokesman Jean Musitelli said. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. counterpart Bill 
Clinton were calling for the summit meeting to be held possibly 
as soon as next month, a presidential spokesman announced 
Thursday in Moscow. 
  Meanwhile, Germany expressed support for Clinton's proposals 
for a tougher military stance and economic sanctions against the 
Serbs, government spokesman Dieter Vogel said Thursday. 
  Speaking of the situation in the besieged Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, Vogel said that "the aggression of Serb troops (...) 
openly violates the elementary principles of humanity and 
international law." 
  Vogel also welcomed Washington's efforts to associate Russia 
with endeavours to settle the Bosnian conflict. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe meanwhile said any 
extension of air strikes to protect UN safe zones "makes sense 
only if it is part of a political proposal" for Bosnia. 
  He said the month-long delay before the proposed 
international summit was "a bit long," but stressed any such 
meeting must be "conclusive" and therefore would need rigorous 
preparation beforehand. 
  Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans, for his part, called 
on the U.S., Russia, the European Union and the UN to "close 
ranks and have a concerted action to solve the problem" of 
Bosnia. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Sofia, where he and Prime 
Minister Ruud Lubbers are on an official visit, Kooijmans also 
said that a signal had to be given to the warring parties that 
"flagrant violations of the (UN) Security Council resolutions 
will not be tolerated." 
  He was referring to the situation in the besieged 
UN-protected enclave of Gorazde. 
  In Denmark, both the government and parliament have declared 
themselves in favour of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air 
strikes against Bosnian Serbs to protect the civilian population 
in the UN-designated "safe areas," parliamentary officials said. 
  "There is a clear need to resort to force, and to back the 
UN 
secretary general's call for an extension to the NATO scope for 
intervention, in order to protect the populations exposed to 
Bosnian Serb shelling, and also Danish troops deployed in 
Bosnia," Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told the press. 
  Australia and the Czech Republic on Thursday also endorsed 
Clinton's proposal for intensified NATO air strikes in Bosnia. 
  The threat of air strikes should force warring parties back 
to talks, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and his Czech 
counterpart Josef Zieleniec told a press conference in Canberra. 
  Zieleniec, who spoke with Evans at the start of a two-day 
visit, said air strikes would not resolve the crisis but were a 
"promising step in the right direction." 
  Signs of cooperation between the United States and Russia 
within the United Nations were also positive, he added. 
  "It is clear that without cooperation among these key forces 
it was impossible to solve anything, let us hope this will be 
the step toward peace in whole Bosnia."

  [Text] Paris, April 21 (AFP) -- The Western allies are 
looking at the possibility of carrying out multiple air strikes 
against military targets in Bosnia in defence of UN-declared 
"safe areas," French Admiral Jacques Lanxade said Thursday [21 
April]. 
  The French armed forces chief-of-staff said the issue would 
be reviewed at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) Friday in Brussels. 
  On Wednesday U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was calling 
on NATO to harden its military stance in the face of the 
continuing Bosnian Serb offensive against the Moslem-held 
enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. 
  "The idea which is now being looked at for the protection of 
the safe areas is a different idea which would consist of being 
able to strike with a greater number of planes a series of 
military targets in a given area," Lanxade told a news briefing. 
  Such strikes would be launched "if the rules set by the 
Atlantic Alliance and the United Nations are broken," he said. 
  There should be "a very significant change in conditions for 
the use" of NATO fighter aircraft "which would allow the air 
force to use its normal means which allow for firing from a safe 
distance," Lanxade said. 
  Close air support requires the presence on the ground of 
soldiers to provide guidance for the planes, he said. 
  Such a tactic, associated with often poor weather in the 
Gorazde area, had forced NATO planes to take risks, he added. 
  One British fighter was shot down last week over Gorazde. 
  Ambassadors of the 16 NATO countries are to meet Friday to 
consider the extension of air strikes in all six safe areas, 
NATO diplomatic sources had earlier said. 
  On Wednesday, the ambassadors had "agreed in principle" to 
UN 
calls for air strikes to protect civilians in the Gorazde, Zepa, 
Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac safe areas. Sarajevo, the sixth 
safe area, was given air cover in February when Bosnian Serbs 
withdrew their artillery from around the town.

  [Text] Vienna, April 21 (AFP) -- Ukraine Thursday [21 
April] ruled out the immediate closure of the Chernobyl nuclear 
power station despite safety fears, at the start of an 
international conference on the eighth anniversary of the 
world's biggest nuclear accident. 
  "There are no plans for the immediate closure of the two 
units" still functioning at Chernobyl, Urainian Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov said, according to a spokesman of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which is hosting the 
two-day meeting in the Austrian capital. 
  This could happen only "when new stations have come on 
stream 
and when the efficiency of conventional stations has been 
improved" and this needed "money and some years," spokesman 
David Kyd quoted him as saying. 
  The IAEA has declared one of the units unsafe to operate and 
the United States has demanded the plant's closure. 
  Ukraine is currently building eight new VVER 1,000-watt 
nuclear stations, of the same design as Chernobyl, which are 
expected to be in operation between 1994 and 1999. 
  The meeting, including experts from 16 countries and 
representatives from the European Union and European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), was called after a report 
by IAEA experts complained about security standards. 
  Fears were compounded further this week when two minor 
accidents took place within two days at the plant, north of the 
Ukrainian capital Kiev. 
  Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear 
accident on April 23, 1986, when the number four reactor 
exploded, releasing a huge radioactive cloud. 
  Last year there were 36 incidents there, four of which led 
to 
a reactor being shut down. Twenty of the incidents caused a 
reduction in power. 
  In 1990, the Ukrainian parliament decided it would close 
down 
Chernobyl for good at the end of 1993, but in October 1993 
deputies voted to keep the plant open in order to reduce 
dependence on Russian energy supplies. 
  On Thursday, Shmarov judged the level of risk to be 
"acceptable" and said the two units produced the equivalent of 
4.7 million tonnes of oil per year, about seven percent of the 
country's total energy production. 
  At the EBRD's annual congress in Saint Petersburg Tuesday, 
Ukrainian Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko called for a 
special fund to be set up to finance the shutdown of Chernobyl 
and asked that some money from an existing fund be used to 
improve security at the plant. 
  The IAEA's director general Hans Blix said Thursday's 
conference aimed to give a full picture of the situation at 
Chernobyl and Ukraine's energy needs. The Agency also hoped to 
identify when the plant was no longer vital to the Ukrainian 
economy and help identity constructive options. 
  The IAEA is worried about standards in the face of an exodus 
of 20 percent of all qualified staff. "A taxi driver in Kiev 
earns more than a qualified worker at Chernobyl," said Kyd. 
  Repair work recommended by the Agency has not been carried 
out and fire protection standards are low, it says. 
  The concrete casing around reactor four, scene of the 1986 
accident, is also seriously damaged, threatening neighbouring 
reactors and posing the danger of radioactive leaks.

<F P=106> [Michel De Muelenaere article: "Parliament Fears a Europe </F>
of Sixteen"] 
  [Text] To expand or not to expand? The suspense remains, 
pending the 4 May decisive vote by the European Parliament (EP) 
on the expansion of the Union to Sweden, Finland, Austria, and 
Norway. The penultimate EP session before the elections next 
June demonstrated the degree to which the deputies are divided, 
not so much on the new memberships as on the material conditions 
for expansion. With a touch of exasperation in some cases.... 
"We have had to swallow so much that we are bordering on 
indigestion," French Deputy Yves Galland complained yesterday. 
  Five times over the past two years, the EP has demanded 
institutional changes ensuring the smooth running of a 16-member 
Union. After refusing these changes, the Twelve concluded the 
negotiations, further complicating the decisionmaking 
procedures. For many deputies, the setback will be fatal to the 
Union. 
<H5>  Opportunity or Threat? </H5>
  On Tuesday, the four candidate countries came to Strasbourg 
to defend their cause, appropriately expounding on the subjects 
of democracy, the parliamentary system, and the European 
commitment. Although Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem 
Brundtland did not appear in the position of a supplicant, her 
colleagues were clearer. "Let us seize this historic 
opportunity," Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Salolainen urged. 
"A rejection of the agreements would be likely to cast doubt on 
the whole process of European building." 
  "What do you stand to gain from joining a Europe which, from 
the start, will demonstrate its complete impotence?" Belgium's 
Fernand Herman replied. "The European Union (EU) is heading for 
disaster for lack of institutional change," French Christian 
Democrat Jean-Louis Bourlanges warned. "And that can only get 
worse." 
  Some deputies want to purely and simply reject the 
agreements. Others, like Mr. Bourlanges and Raymonde Dury, are 
arguing for the postponement of the vote until the year end. A 
period in which to negotiate new institutional progress for the 
EU. Should there be a simple six-month delay, or a postponement 
of two to three years? Opinions differ. "The effect of a 
postponement on public opinion in our countries would be 
disastrous," the candidates retorted. "You would be taking a 
considerable risk. If you halt the impetus, nobody can predict 
the future. The train is starting now," Austrian Vice 
Chancellor Erhard Busek emphasized. 
  The 4 May vote will be very tricky in any case. The 
advocates of expansion must obtain 260 votes out of 518. The 
latest counts in Strasbourg yesterday gave a majority in favor 
of the four treaties. But the majority is a prey to 
circumstances, in view of the 90 deputies who deserted 
Strasbourg as soon as they were elected five years ago, in view 
of those absent because of election campaigns, opponents, and 
abstentions. In any case, any shortfall will benefit the "no" 
vote. 
  Between now and then, the EP will be subjected to all kinds 
of pressure. The Germans have proved most effective at this 
little game. Virtually all German deputies, of all groups, will 
vote in favor of membership. "This is a fascination for a 
MittelEuropa of which Berlin will be the center," according to a 
French Socialist. The Belgians, however, will vote mainly 
against the agreements. 
  For oppositionists, the choice is Cornelian. Should they 
approve of the memberships when they threaten the smooth running 
or even the EU survival? Or should the expansion be rejected in 
order to secure a EU strengthening, at the risk of seeming to 
choose isolation? Yesterday, it was a disillusioned Jacques 
Delors who called on the deputies to approve the agreements, 
remarking that the Maastricht Treaty started a drift by Europe 
which must be combated. 
  The political consequences of 4 May will be great. By 
approving texts which run counter to its previous demands, 
Parliament will lose a new piece of its credibility. And it is 
likely to be regarded as no more than a "rubber stamp" by the 
governments.... If it rejects them, it will lay the foundation 
for a new crisis.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "Applicants Apply Pressure, EU </F>
Parliament Hesitates"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- The EU [European Union] applicants 
warn the European Parliament: Membership delay will have 
catastrophic repercussions. 
  Despite the fact that the four EU applicant nations 
yesterday 
exerted massive political pressure to get the European 
Parliament to say "yes" to the results of the membership 
negotiations, there are still some doubts about whether it is 
possible to scrape together the necessary majority of 260 of the 
total of 518 popularly elected members of parliament to reach 
the necessary decision on 4 May. Signals from the various party 
groupings indicate that a further 30 to 40 votes are still 
needed. 
  Well aware of the growing skepticism in Strasbourg; a 
skepticism which is not due to any reluctance to enlarge the EU, 
but because the Parliament wants to take the opportunity to 
demand more power for itself, the European Parliament's deputies 
yesterday received a visit from what is undoubtedly the most 
heavyweight lobbying group which has ever tried to influence 
them [sentence as published]. 
  In turn Prime Ministers Gro Harlem Brundtland and Carl 
Bildt, 
Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, and Finnish Trade 
Minister Pertti Salolainen made it crystal clear what negative 
consequences any delay by the Palriament will have for public 
opinion in the four applicant countries, the EU countries, and 
for European policy in general. Former Conservative Party 
leader Kaci Kullmann Five was also in Strasbourg to influence 
the conservative party group. 
  Salolainen took the toughest approach. He claimed that a 
postponement of enlargement would have a catastrophic effect on 
the Finnish people. "If you do not deal with the matter now, a 
completely impossible situation will arise. You would be 
assuming an enormous political responsibility if you said `no,'" 
the Finnish minister said. The Austrian vice chancellor was in 
complete agreement, and warned against doing anything which 
could threaten the current positive attitude to the EU in his 
home country. 
  "What sort of message do you think will be sent to the 
Swedish people if you say `no' now?" Carl Bildt asked. Gro 
Harlem Brundtland, who is battling against a body of public 
opinion at home which takes the most negative view of the EU, 
wisely refrained from indicating what view will be taken of a 
delay. But she made it clear that a "no" in Strasbourg will 
have a very negative effect in the applicant countries and in 
Europe. 
  The European Parliament's skepticism about admitting new 
members without concomitant institutional reforms has been 
reinforced since the EU countries adopted a compromise on voting 
rules in the Council of Ministers just before Easter. Many 
people in Strasbourg take the view that the compromise makes it 
even more difficult than it was to reach majority decisions in 
the EU. There is also tangible irritation that the Parliament 
is only being given a couple of weeks in which to discuss the 
final results of the membership negotiations. 
  "What is so wrong with a postponement of six months?" 
British 
socialist Gary Titley asked. His French fellow party member, 
Gerhard Fuchs, hoped that the Parliament will go on saying "no" 
to the applicants until the Council withdraws the Ioannina 
compromise on voting rules. Holland's Jean Penders, a 
conservative, said that the Parliament's credibility is at 
stake. This is why the question of new members must be 
deferred, he said. "Why do you want to join a Union which is so 
powerless?" an indignant Belgian socialist, Fernand Herman, 
asked. 
  The majority of those who spoke were negative. Danish 
conservative politician Marie Jepsen was one of the few 
exceptions. "We should say not only `yes,' but `yes, please,' 
to the applicant countries," she said. 
  Harlem Brundtland, Bildt, and the other two lobbyists made 
efforts to convince the Parliament that they -- as soon as their 
countries have joined the EU -- will work actively to strengthen 
the role of the Parliament and the EU's ability to reach 
decisions. But they clearly distanced themselves from the fact 
that their applications are now being used as a way of applying 
pressure to try to force through more power for the Parliament. 
Nor did they have any time for the view voiced that a delay 
would only be for six months.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Elmar </F>
Oberhauser; Vranitzky in the television studio in New York -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, what concrete and 
specific possibilities does the UN secretary general see for 
putting an end to the war in Bosnia? 
  [Vranitzky] The UN secretary general can only view the issue 
in terms of possibilities, because he himself does not have any 
armed forces, he himself does not have any other hierarchies. 
What must be demanded now -- and this has been discussed very 
intensively here over the past 48 hours -- is that the 
individual NATO governments -- that is, the governments of the 
United States and Canada, the governments of the West European 
countries, and, in addition to NATO, also the government of 
Russia, which means, all those countries that are able and 
willing to follow a common course -- do indeed follow such a 
common course. If the United Nations does not have the support 
of its largest and most important members, the United Nations 
will not become stronger, either. One must accept this, this is 
reality. 
  Therefore, it is not so important now whether the UN 
secretary general does or says this or that, but whether his 
members give him a clear indication of what they are willing to 
do. 
  [Oberhauser] Well, in Europe at least there is massive 
criticism that the United Nations and the United States do not 
know at all what is going on in Bosnia and assess the situation 
completely incorrectly. Do you also have this impression? 
  [Vranitzky] I cannot confirm this impression here, but I 
think that this impression is irrelevant. In the talks with 
Butrus-Ghali and his associates I have noted that they know very 
well what is going on. After all, they constantly have their 
observers and their people there. They have also sent people 
there, who are occasionally right in the middle of hails of 
bullets. If they do not know what is going on, I wonder how 
others claim to know that, when they are 600 km away. 
  [Oberhauser] Do people in New York, at the UN headquarters, 
still believe in a negotiated solution? 
  [Vranitzky] One must believe that, because so many terrible 
things are happening there, so much injustice and so many acts 
of violence, that neither in New York nor, I think, anywhere 
else in the world -- in Washington or in Vienna -- can one 
simply accept it and say: Unfortunately, no solution can be 
found and, therefore, we will not do anything. I think, in 
particular since things have become as difficult as they are 
now, one needs renewed efforts. 
  Just let me repeat: The big powers, which are, after all, 
the determining factors, must first work out a common line and 
second, make it absolutely clear that they will implement this 
common line, regardless of what it is. If they leave the 
slightest doubt that they do not mean seriously what they say -- 
be it together or individually -- it is easy for the aggressors 
in Bosnia -- for the Serbs and for everybody else -- to say: 
Those guys in the West are not serious anyway and, therefore, 
we can just go on shooting as we like. Unfortunately, this is 
what has happened so far. 
  Today, in all these talks here, it became clear that if this 
continues, no solution will be found. Therefore, a clear, 
common, and cohesive attitude is important. I hope that such an 
attitude can now be found. 
  [Oberhauser] Let us come to a specific matter regarding 
Bosnia and Austria: Today you presented a proposal to hold a 
conference on the reconstruction of Bosnia in Vienna. What was 
Butrus-Ghali's response? 
  [Vranitzky] His response was quite positive, because it is 
precisely one of the points that the issue is not just about 
holding a conference. There are a lot of conferences. The 
issue is to give the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the 
embattled areas, in the fringe areas, in the border areas hope 
that, if the fighting is stopped, the international community 
will be ready immediately to contribute to and help with the 
reconstruction of hospitals, means of transportation, houses, 
schools, and everything needed by people who want to reconstruct 
their homeland again after a war. 
  [Oberhauser] What does this mean for this conference, Mr. 
Chancellor? When would this conference have to start work? 
  [Vranitzky] I will start preparing for it immediately. 
  [Oberhauser] And who is supposed to participate in it? 
  [Vranitzky] I believe that we will find an appropriate 
framework with the OECD states. The OECD, the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, is, as its name indicates, 
the appropriate organization for this purpose. It also has the 
necessary expertise. Then, of course, we have to negotiate with 
the individual countries about how much money each is willing to 
provide -- because there is no question that this will cost 
money -- and what kind of expertise will be made available for 
the reconstruction an area destroyed by war, as has happened 
many times in history before. 
  [Oberhauser] According to news agency reports, one subject 
of your talks was Vienna's role as a UN city and the concern in 
Vienna that the city might lose importance in this respect 
because again and again there is a danger of UN institutions 
being removed from Vienna. What about that? 
  [Vranitzky] First of all, we have to cope with one 
contradiction into which some Austrians slide again and again. 
They constantly criticize the United Nations for not being able 
to achieve anything and, in the same breath, they complain if 
one or another UN department is removed from Vienna. 
  Thus, we must come to a decision -- do we want it or don't 
we. I think we want it because otherwise we would not have 
built the Vienna International Center, and it also has many 
important tasks. In particular in connection with the 
reconstruction of East Europe -- this will apply not only to 
Yugoslavia; in the future we will have to cooperate with many 
others -- it is sensible for Austria to work on having Vienna as 
a UN location also play a role in the future. This will be the 
issue. 
  I told Secretary General Butrus-Ghali precisely what I told 
you just now and I persuaded him to personally advocate this 
politically and within the UN framework, because if the top 
official, the head of this organization does not move ahead in 
this issue, it will be more difficult for us. However, this was 
a very good talk. I invited him to Vienna. At the 50th 
anniversary of the United Nations next spring in Vienna we will 
be able to say something more specific about this issue. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, one question in conclusion -- 
and I refer again to news agency reports. Reportedly 
Butrus-Ghali asked you for more Austrian UN missions. Will 
Austria be able to fulfill this wish? 
  [Vranitzky] He did not voice this desire today, but this 
would not have been necessary anyway, because, in cooperation 
with the National Defense Council, the Austrian Government began 
some time ago to work out how we can better prepare ourselves 
for future demands on Austrian soldiers in peacekeeping 
missions. First of all, it is necessary to make preparations 
during training for areas that are not altogether usual for 
Austrians. Then, precautions also need to be taken regarding 
equipment and everything that is needed for such a mission. 
Today I told him that we have started this work and that it 
will take quite a while yet to conclude it. Then we will brief 
him on the results. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, thank you very much for being 
our guest, and I wish you a good flight home. 
  [Vranitzky] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dehaene by correspondent Anne </F>
Quevrain; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Anchorman Lambrechts] The Rwandan ambassador to 
Zaire has, in the last few hours, reiterated accusations against 
the Belgian blue helmets, saying that three Belgian soldiers 
used missiles to shoot down the plane carrying the Rwandan 
president. That assassination provoked the current violence in 
that country. Today the Belgian Government, through Prime 
Minister Dehaene, most firmly denies those allegations. 
  [Dehaene] Apparently, this anti-Belgian propaganda has not 
stopped and it is clear that it is unfounded. It is the policy 
of some Rwandan clan which obviously has decided to place the 
responsibility on the Belgians. 
  [Quevrain] Are you not afraid that these allegations will 
tarnish the image of Belgium? 
  [Dehaene] I do not believe that they will be seen as very 
credible abroad. I believe that it clearly must be stated that 
they are unfounded and that the Belgian troops were in Rwanda to 
implement the peace and cooperation agreements and had no role 
in domestic affairs.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Belgian Defense Minister Leo </F>
Delcroix by Ann Bats and Laurent Panneels in Brussels; date not 
given: "A Rest Period of a Couple Months Is Welcome Now"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "The Blue Helmets who were killed in 
Rwanda could do nothing more but hand over their weapons. Two 
of them were lying on the ground with the barrel of a loaded gun 
pressed against their heads." 
  That is what Defense Minister Leo Delcroix said in an 
exclusive interview with this newspaper. "Anyone else would 
have done the same thing if their colleagues' lives were 
threatened in this way." 
  "In the future, whenever we are asked to undertake UN 
missions, we will first lay down a number of conditions." 
Before things get to that stage, however, Delcroix wants a 
period for all the parties involved to reflect on things. "I am 
not, however, one of those people who says that it would be 
better for us to stop all UN operations." 
  "For the time being, I am suggesting that we calm things 
down. In the fall we can once again consider the situation. Our 
military personnel really need this rest period, both physically 
and emotionally, and to see their families." 
  [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] In terms of their morale, are the Blue 
Helmets fully prepared for their mission? 
  [Delcroix] Naturally it is hard for one to be prepared for 
things such as what recently happened. Who could be prepared 
for that kind of massacre? Generally speaking, our people have 
the right preparation. That is also one of the reasons why our 
military personnel are so often asked [to participate]. 
Psychological support improves every year. Of course, it is 
not yet at its optimal level. A lot can still be done, but 
compared to many other countries, our people are well prepared. 
  [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Yet, some people are saying that only 
highly specialized military personnel should be called in for UN 
operations. 
  [Delcroix] I do not oppose looking into that kind of 
project, 
or having our country join in eventually. It is somewhat easier 
in theory than in practice. I am indeed prepared to look into 
it, as long as a concrete project can be put proposed. 
Personally, I think it is better to draw on all of our manpower 
in accordance with the situation when it comes to deploying 
military personnel. To date, some 12,000 Belgian military 
personnel have taken part in UN operations. The experience they 
have gained is of inestimable value. This is a lot more than 
"joy-riding in Leopoldsburg," where you know the scenery. I do 
not wish to ridicule the existing exercises, but there is an 
enormous gap between them and practical experience as a Blue 
Helmet. In recent weeks, some people have advocated putting a 
number of military personnel on standby at a base somewhere in 
Africa. I definitely want to look into this, but account must 
be taken of the budgetary consequences. We are not France. I 
shy away from overly theoretical approaches. 
  [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Does the rigid UN decisionmaking 
structure fit in with the flexible approach expected of the 
military? 
  [Delcroix] Security from one area to the next cannot be 
judged from New York. This calls for a more flexible mandate 
with greater powers for the military commander on site. In 
addition, the military logistics in New York must be reinforced. 
I am not calling for a top-heavy structure, but there must be a 
little military planning. At present, too much of this is left 
up to civilians. With all due respect to the diplomats, when 
military operations are involved, then it is the military men 
who must make the decisions and draw up the plans. For example, 
after Yugoslavia, we ourselves had to drag along a lot of 
equipment. For the first half of the year, we just sat in the 
open air. This clearly demonstrated to me that the diplomats 
are not the most appropriate people for organizing these kinds 
of military operations. Major influence from the military 
apparatus in New York is essential. 
  [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Is everyone at the United Nations 
ready to learn lessons from previous operations? 
  [Delcroix] We will have to wait and see. But it is clear 
that any further UN participation by us is only possible subject 
to strict conditions. After the events in Rwanda and the 
heroism shown by our soldiers there, we are obliged to state 
that the United Nations must learn lessons from these 
experiences. I believe that people will listen to us, not the 
least because we have shown in the past our own readiness to 
listen to others. 
  [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] You attach strict conditions to any 
future UN participation. Does this also mean changes for the 
Blue Helmets at present in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Delcroix] We certainly do not want any abrupt change. The 
view I have just presented must, however, gradually be applied 
there too. A few months ago, we substantially increased our 
arms there at our own initiative. We informed the United 
Nations that we would be bringing in these heavier weapons. I 
also added that if the United Nations refused to allow this, it 
would pose a problem for us. The United Nations, no doubt 
reluctantly, accepted this. 
  [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] What do you think about Professor Suy's 
remark that the Blue Helmets should not have handed over their 
weapons? 
  [Delcroix] Such a statement is hasty and unprofessional. Let 
the military make the judgment. I first want to read the 
military reports of what exactly happened. Only then can you 
judge in what circumstances the Blue Helmets handed over their 
weapons. If, as I have been told, they stood there with rifles 
aimed at the heads of two of their colleagues, I do not know 
what else they could have done. People should be careful about 
what they say about it now. I first want to know the exact 
circumstances. My initial impression is that the 10 soldiers 
and the military commander acted correctly, both in military and 
in human terms. 
  [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Yet again the Belgian Army has had to 
evacuate compatriots from Africa. Do you find it responsible, 
once things calm down a little in Rwanda, for Belgians who are 
perfectly aware of the dangers to return? 
  [Delcroix] Wherever there is a high concentration of 
compatriots who are in need, then even if the Belgian Army has 
been there 17 times before, it will still go back an 18th time. 
I feel that something snapped with this event. What is 
happening now is not an "everyday" evacuation exercise. This is 
not just one of many. Over the coming weeks and months there is 
also a need to reflect on our future policy, including 
cooperation policy. We cannot now say: The incident is over 
and we will start again where we left off. That is no good. It 
is not only at the military level that we must learn from 
experience, but also at the level of cooperation and foreign 
policy. We cannot simply continue as if nothing had happened. 
It has also shaken some of my own beliefs. But we have put a 
lot of money and effort into setting up this cooperation. When 
you now see what it has brought, it is not so easy to swallow. 
Furthermore, over recent years in parliament we had succeeded 
in bringing a different attitude with respect to military 
cooperation. Five or 10 years ago, this cooperation was still 
seen as something exceptional. Now even the Greens see the 
virtues of this cooperation. A different mentality had grown 
up. After what has happened over recent days you cannot fail, 
however, to ask questions, even if it is with pain in your 
heart. In this area too, reflection is necessary. I do not 
want to choose in the short term between two extremes. Before 
taking any far-reaching decisions about African policy as a 
whole, we must see of what we are capable. That will ensure 
that we do not take on more than we can handle.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Army Chief of Staff General Charlier </F>
by Katrin Brahy; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Anchorman Lambrechts] For Lieutenant General 
Charlier, the Belgian Army chief of staff, the mission in Rwanda 
was the most difficult of all those carried out in Africa in a 
long time. Gen. Charlier confirmed the anti-Belgian resentment 
in Rwanda. However, the Belgian troops will serve again for the 
United Nations if the need arises, but not under the same 
conditions. Gen. Charlier was interviewed by Katrin Brahy. 
  [Charlier] I believe that this type of mission will remain 
essential in the future. The international community cannot 
ignore situations like that prevailing in Rwanda, Yugoslavia, or 
Cambodia; it has to be present and reduce the degree of violence 
in those countries. 
  [Brahy] I assume that if the circumstances so dictate, you 
would like your mandate to be changed? 
  [Charlier] Exactly. As in any military operation, the means, 
the mandates, and the conditions of an intervention should be 
adapted to the actual situation on the spot instead of being 
subject to the slow UN procedures. For example, the Belgian 
Government asked on 7 April for a modification to the UNAMIR [UN 
mission in Rwanda] mandate. It was told that this would take 
weeks! Thus, some fundamental things certainly must be changed 
regarding relations between UN Headquarters in New York and the 
theaters of operations. The rights and conditions for the blue 
helmets to protect themselves must be adapted to the 
circumstances.

Against Serbs"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Prime Minister Lubbers feels that the 
international community must show that it is determined to end 
the war in Bosnia. He said this yesterday upon his departure 
from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. 
  Foreign Minister Kooijmans, who accompanied Lubbers, noted 
that the chances for calling a halt to the war have dropped in 
the last two weeks. He also talked of a "common front," which 
must make it clear that the flagrant violations of the UN 
resolutions will no longer be tolerated. 
  The Netherlands had raised some questions about the request 
to NATO made by the UN secretary general to carry out air 
strikes around the "safe areas" in Bosnia. In a letter to the 
Second Chamber, Kooijmans said that "there must be better 
coordination with other countries that are supplying troops. 
There must also be a sufficient number of troops present in the 
"safe areas."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Radio Contact With Four Missing UN </F>
Soldiers"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The Defense Ministry has reestablished 
contact with four of the five Netherlander UN observers who were 
missing in Bosnia. 
  The only person with whom contact has not been made is Major 
Van Baal, who left to take leave 10 days ago in Sarajevo, 
against UN advice. 
  Development Cooperation Minister Pronk made an appeal on the 
radio this morning [20 April] for the West to send more ground 
troops to Bosnia. According to Pronk, the Serbs must be 
convinced by the reinforcement of the international peacekeeping 
force that the international community is "serious." 
  Since the UN troops have only a peacekeeping mission, air 
strikes are only allowed if UN troops are directly endangered. 
Neither the Air Force nor the ground troops, who are in the 
UN's service, have a mandate to impose peace. Moreover, they 
operate only with the consent of the belligerents in Bosnia. 
  Within NATO, there have been hurried consultations to decide 
whether NATO aircraft can also be put into action if the 
populations of the "safe areas" are directly endangered, as was 
the case in Goradze. The Security Council has never given a 
mandate for ground actions. Ground troops must indeed protect 
the population of the "safe areas" and provide assistance for 
the passage of humanitarian transport. 
  Pronk's statements are causing increasing irritation at the 
Defense Ministry and some high-level military officials fear 
that the military and political opinions of the development 
cooperation minister could cause confusion among the Netherlands 
military regarding Netherlands policy. [Defense] Minister Relus 
Ter Beek has repeatedly said that the Netherlands could not 
deliver more ground troops since there are not enough 
sufficiently trained career military personnel. 
  Ter Beek let it be known to those around him that Pronk was 
speaking for himself and was not giving the government view. 
The safety of the Netherlands troops has not been endangered 
through actions taken in recent days, the Defense Ministry said. 
At noon Friday, the Second Chamber will talk with the defense 
and foreign ministers about the new situation in Bosnia. A 
majority of the Chamber wants the Netherlands to make 
politically active efforts in order to curb Serbian violence in 
Bosnia. The parliamentarians initially wanted an emergency 
debate but now they will settle for a statement.
