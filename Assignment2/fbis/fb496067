<F P=106> [By Stephen Alderman, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>
  [Text] Britain is pressing for a "rapid and united" 
response from NATO to a request from United Nations Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for more help in Bosnia, the prime 
minister told the Commons today. 
  NATO "should help" the UN to give stronger protection to the 
UN-designated safe areas, Mr. Major said at question time. 
  He insisted that, while keeping the objective of a 
negotiated 
settlement in view, attacks on UN troops or the safe areas "will 
meet with a strong response." 
  The prime minister was replying to Tory John Ward (Poole), 
who pressed him to "condemn unreservedly" continuing Serb 
attacks on Gorazde and called for "more effective action by NATO 
and the UN" to protect the safe areas. 
  Mr. Major replied that Mr. Ward spoke for most people in the 
UK. 
  He added: "These attacks have rightly been condemned by 
European, Russian and American leaders alike. NATO should help 
the UN to give stronger protection to the safe areas and I hope 
that the additional troops committed to the UN Protection Force 
and the necessary funds will be made available as soon as 
possible." 
  Mr. Major continued: "The UK is pressing for a rapid and 
united NATO response to the secretary general's request for 
further assistance that must, of course, be based on a thorough 
military appraisal." 
  The Government would also be studying proposals made by 
President Clinton last night, said the prime minister. 
  "But we must keep the objectives of a negotiated settlement 
clearly in view while showing that attacks on UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] or safe areas will meet with a strong 
response."

<F P=106> [Sonia Purnell report: "MoD Loses Tanks In German </F>
Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] A large amount of plastic explosive, detonators, 
sub-machine guns and even, it is feared, tanks have been lost by 
the Ministry of Defence during the withdrawal of British troops 
and equipment from Germany, the National Audit Office said 
yesterday. 
  The restructuring of the British Army of the Rhine under 
Options for Change -- Britain's largest movement of troops and 
equipment in modern times -- had descended into "chaos and 
pandemonium," an audit office spokeswoman said. 
  In some units there had been a virtual breakdown of control, 
with large numbers of dangerous and expensive items of equipment 
unaccounted for. 
  Only four out of the 116 units shut down in Germany could 
account for all their equipment, and in just one small survey 
the audit office found that several vehicles were missing, one 
for nearly three years, as well as 60lb of plastic explosive and 
110 detonators. 
  The audit office warned that the taxpayer would lose much of 
the expected "peace dividend" through write-offs for missing 
items and other organisational problems. 
  The Ministry of Defence now expects to save only 35 million 
pounds a year in the early stages of the withdrawal 24 million 
pounds less than originally expected. 
  The National Audit Office described the losses as "very 
worrying indeed'' and pointed to the "very slow progress" made 
by the MoD in improving controls. 
  Army commanders at all levels have now been reminded of the 
need for correct accounting procedures and for prompt action to 
resolve any discrepancies. Inquiries are to be extended to 
ammunition stores. 
  The audit office acknowleged the enormity of the task facing 
the Army, which is having to move 13 billion items from 38 
locations in Germany to 48 sites in the United Kingdom. By 
1995, there will be 27,000 fewer Service personnel in Germany, 
2,900 fewer armoured vehicles and 18,000 fewer non-armoured 
vehicles. 
  Much of the withdrawal has been conducted during a time of 
"unparalleled upheaval" with military operations both in the 
Gulf and the former Yugoslavia. 
  Last year more than 5 million pounds was raised from sales 
of 
surplus equipment. But the audit office wants more vehicle 
sales to be made in Germany, where prices are higher, and for 
saleable vehicles to be cannibalised for parts only when this is 
essential and cost-effective.

  [Text] Paris, April 22 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe said Friday [22 April] that NATO should issue an 
ultimatum to Serbs to halt their offensive against the Moslem 
enclave of Gorazde or face airstrikes. 
  "It's the same thinking as in Sarajevo," Juppe said, 
speaking 
of an earlier warning by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they continued to shell the Bosnian 
capital. 
  "NATO should force compliance with the UN Security Council 
decision, including issuing an ultimatum," he said. 
  Juppe was speaking to reporters shortly before NATO was to 
meet in Brussels to discuss a possible extension of air strikes 
in Bosnia in the wake of a UN Security Council resolution 
calling on the Bosnian Serbs to observe a ceasefire around 
Gorazde and pull their forces back from the town.

    [Editorial Report] Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe 
was interviewed by "P.S." in the 7 April Paris daily LIBERATION 
on the eve of his visit to China, where he accompanied Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  When asked why he had decided to normalize relations with 
China as early as his April 1993 appointment, Juppe replied that 
it is impossible to continue quarreling with China for obvious 
economic, political, strategic, and demographic reasons. 
Moreover, he said, the dialogue with China had been broken off 
in the absence of "major differences in foreign policy," since 
the sale of French aircraft and frigates to Taiwan did not 
justify a two-year quarrel, and might be compensated by sales to 
the PRC. When the interviewer pointed out that no important 
contracts are expected from the visit, Juppe noted this was not 
a "commercial" trip, and that it was only aimed at improving the 
political climate between the two nations. "P.S." then asked 
whether Chinese violations of human rights would pose a problem. 
Juppe observed that such violations pose no problem for the 
United States, which has not revoked most-favored-nation status 
for China. While France does not "renounce any of its 
principles," Juppe continued, "we must not close the door in 
China's face, or else we would quarrel with three-fourths of the 
planet." Juppe also contended that China has accomplished "some 
progress" in human rights, and that events in that country will 
"make the system of repression untenable." When asked whether 
France was wrong in supporting Chinese dissidents after 1989, 
Juppe said it was not, and noted that while France must let 
China know that the present situation is not satisfactory, an 
equilibrium must be found between "indifference and excessive 
zeal." 
  Despite Prime Minister Balladur's affirmation that his China 
visit achieved his "political objectives," he nevertheless 
suffered a "half-failure," because his trip was designed to 
combine the "irreconcilable" objectives of restoring relations 
and promoting commercial interests, Jacques Amalric writes in 
the 12 April Paris daily LIBERATION. By dispatching businessman 
Jacques Friedmann to Beijing as early as July 1993 to negotiate 
the normalization of Sino-French ties at the cost of ending 
military sales to Taiwan, Balladur--egged on by Rally for the 
Republic leader Jacques Chirac--placed himself in a "position of 
inferiority," appearing as the mere spokesman of large 
industrial interests, Amalric continues. Meanwhile, the prime 
minister's entourage is arguing "without much conviction" that 
France is now on an equal footing with its competitors in vying 
for important contracts with China; it is also presenting as a 
"semivictory" the fact that no invitation to visit Paris was 
extended to Chinese Premier Li Peng. However, these contracts 
will be dearly paid for, first by French taxpayers--since France 
is only second to Japan in granting "privileged" credits to 
China--and also in terms of France's image in an Asia that is 
"watching Beijing's least moves through a magnifying glass," 
Amalric concludes.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Armed Forces: 613.1 </F>
Billion Francs Over Six Years"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The aim is for France 
(represented by a head of state and a prime minister who have 
not been elected on the same program and who do not refer to the 
same ideology) to maintain its world ranking as second largest 
Western military power. France wishes to maintain its autonomy 
of intervention wherever its interests are at stake. At the 
same time, it wishes to be the driving force in the building of 
a European defense. 
  Edouard Balladur and [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard are 
determined to carry through this programming law without waiting 
for [the presidential election in] 1995. Some people in the RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] and UDF [French Democratic Union] had 
suggested postponing the exercise until after the presidential 
election. The prime minister did not follow this expedient 
advice. Precisely because of the importance which he personally 
attaches to defense and security questions, it is he who decided 
on an increase of 0.5 percent, contrary to the aims of the law 
on controlling public spending. 
  The method adopted consisted of giving preference to what is 
reasonable over what is spectacular and adopting an attitude of 
great caution. It is in 1997 that we will see whether it is 
financially possible to launch several new programs like the 
future large transport plane, the second nuclear aircraft 
carrier, the NH-90 helicopter, the future sea-to-sea missile. 
  Between now and then, efforts will be made to successfully 
complete the major programs already started: the new generation 
of missile-launching nuclear submarines (Triomphant and 
Temeraire, due to come into service in 1996 and 1998); the 
Leclerc tank (310 will be supplied in the year 2000); the 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; and the 
Navy's Rafale plane (operational in 1999); the Tigre helicopter 
(first deliveries in the year 2001); the Air Force Rafale from 
the year 2001-2002 (with a delay of one year mainly due to 
technological problems). 
  The only major program which will be launched as soon as the 
law comes into force is the development of the ATPGD (Precision 
Weapon Fired over a Long Distance) missile. What is it? 
Although the concept has virtually been defined, the program 
has not yet been finally decided. It will be a cruise missile 
of the Tomahawk type, in other words subsonic like the Apache, 
or supersonic like the medium-range air-to-surface missile, 
capable of covering between 500 and 1,000 km and reaching its 
target with an accuracy of approximately 1 meter. Its warhead 
would be exclusively conventional. 
  The austerity requirement called for a further reduction in 
the nuclear deterrence effort. Nuclear funds, which, less than 
10 years ago, formed almost one-third of the Armed Forces' 
equipment budget, have already fallen below 25 percent and will 
fall further until they only account for one-fifth of Section V. 
In six years, 134 billion francs [Fr] will nonetheless be 
devoted to it, of which Fr10 billion will be just for the Palen 
simulation program intended to reduce the number of nuclear 
tests. These tests are not mentioned much in the bill. 
Everybody knows that the subject is taboo until the 
presidential election in May 1995, although all the necessary 
steps have been taken to resume them without delay. 
  With regard to manning levels, the draft programming law 
continues the reduction started over recent years, but with much 
less brutality. Leotard is not Joxe. The general staffs have 
been consulted, and fairly broadly heeded. In all, 42,100 jobs 
will be eliminated in six years, of which 25,700 will be 
conscripts, 12,800 civilians, and 3,600 regular soldiers. 
However, 11,700 new jobs will be created which results in a 
figure of 30,400 job losses. 
  The Army will lose 16,872 jobs; although it is to gain 5,801 
in regular soldiers, it is to lose 19,185 conscripts and 3,500 
civilians. In the year 2000, it will have 227,000 men (the Joxe 
plan made provision for 225,000 in 1997). It will keep eight 
out of the nine divisions it has now and the 13 it still had in 
1990. 
  The Navy will lose 2,461 jobs: 2,161 conscripts and 500 
civilians. It will gain 200 regular posts. In the year 2000, 
it will have 68,441 men (compared with 70,902 today). 
  The Air Force will lose 6,098 jobs: 1,628 will be regular 
Air Force personnel; 4,100 conscripts; and 370 civilians. In 
the year 2000, it will have fallen from 94,869 to 88,771 men. 
  The gendarmerie is the only branch of the Armed Forces to 
see 
its manning levels increase. It is to gain 750 men in its 
regular force, 1,000 conscripts, and 226 civilians. And it will 
thus become the second largest branch of the Armed Forces with 
95,000 men (as against 93,024 in 1994). 
  The 11,700 jobs created will relate to intelligence (500 
civilians), professionalization (8,200 of which 7,000 will be 
engaged by the Army), the gendarmerie (almost 2,000 posts 
created), officers (382 naval officers, 123 petty officers, and 
500 armaments engineers). 
  This bill must now be submitted to parliament. The deputies 
will debate it on 24 May and the senators in June. It is not 
customary for it to generate amendments. However, Edouard 
Balladur and Francois Leotard are prepared for a broad debate, 
even outside parliament. They are fairly calm. They think it 
likely that criticisms will be expressed in the ranks of the 
majority. Some will think that too much is being spent on 
defense. Others will say that they would have liked a more 
generous law making it possible to launch new programs (for 
instance in the antimissile sphere) and at the same time to 
satisfy all the industrial sectors of defense and to maintain 
their 330,000 jobs. But, when it comes to the vote, there 
should be broad agreement.

  [Text] Twenty-four hours ago the cabinet approved a law 
setting out the military plans for the next six years. Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard has now given more details on the 
French Army's equipment. The priority will be the modernization 
of weapons, nuclear and nonnuclear weapons. Francois Leotard 
was interviewed by Frederique Barrere: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] Modernizing our forces means, of 
course, keeping our nuclear dissuasion for ever. The law 
provides 130 billion francs to preserve and renew our nuclear 
capacity. So, we have decided to continue our efforts as far as 
the M5 missile is concerned. It will start operation in the 
year 2010, not in 2005. We will continue the program concerning 
four SSBN's of the new generation. The basic weapons we need 
are taken in due consideration: Leclerc tanks, the Tigre 
helicopter, the nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, 
which will be operational by mid-1999 with its flotilla of the 
naval version Rafale interceptor-planes. The Air Force will 
also have the Mirage 2000D; as you know the first planes of this 
kind are being used in Bosnia-Herzegovina now. Lastly, in line 
with our crisis-management strategy, we will start a program for 
long-range precision weapons which should be completed by 2001.

<F P=106> [Article signed J.I.: "Army Manpower Could Stabilize at </F>
About 233,000 Men by Year 2000"] 
  [Text] The gradual downsizing of the army should cease and 
manpower levels stabilize by the year 2000 at about 233,000 men, 
rather than at 225,000 as earlier projected. This target is 
inscribed in the draft military programming law to be submitted 
to a meeting of the Defense Council on 6 April and to the 
Council of Ministers on 20 April. 
  If the government adopts this army general staff proposal, 
it 
will mean an interruption of the downsizing and reorganization 
envisaged in earlier decisions. As of 1994, the army comprises 
240,000 men, about 45 percent of the nation's overall military 
manpower. 
  Loath to add to unemployment or exacerbate the decline of 
economic activity in zones where the armed forces in many cases 
are the only source of jobs, the government has suspended the 
force restructuring initiated by previous governments. The new 
approach has been applauded by local officials. It entails 
keeping troop strength at the 240,000 level until 1997, with 
overall strength amounting to nine divisions: four divisions 
attached to the Rapid Action Force (FAR); one armored division 
and a mixed brigade assigned to the European Corps (in which 
Germany and Belgium are also participating); with three armored 
divisions and one mountain infantry division (which will result 
from the merger, next June, of the 15th Infantry Division and 
the 27th Mountain Division) forming the largest part of the 
Mechanized Armor Corps (CBM). Since Eurocorps enjoys special 
status, what France calls the "field forces" consist of the FAR 
and the CBM. 
  The current draft of the 1995-2000 military programming law 
envisages an army of 233,000 men by the end of the century. The 
original objective of downsizing to a 225,000-man army would be 
abandoned. Although 225,000 was the figure on which Defense 
Ministry and general staff had agreed, the budget office was 
actually thinking more in terms of an army reduced to 200,000 
men. 
  At a force level of 233,000--implying a measure of further 
downsizing between 1997 and 2000--the army is unsure whether it 
can maintain its nine divisions as presently constituted, or 
will be forced to go to eight "densified" divisions, accepting 
the loss of one infantry or armored division. 
<H5>  Decision Pending </H5>
  The slowdown in reduction of troop-strength--whether 
eventually to 233,000, or to 225,000 as the Joxe plan 
prescribed--is going to mean higher operating overhead for the 
army (Title 3 of the finance bill), and therefore reduced 
appropriations for material (Title 5). What is added to 
operations must be taken from equipment, to keep the total 
defense budget relatively unchanged. The debate pits proponents 
of a smaller but better equipped army against advocates of an 
army that while larger would not be equipped with the most 
modern armaments. 
  This is especially the case for the CBM. The question not 
yet 
decided is whether the army will have to make do with three 
armored divisions, each disposing altogether of 160 of the most 
modern Leclerc tanks, or will instead maintain the present four 
armored divisions, with one of them keeping the AMX-30 B2 (aging 
but renovated) until its dissolution. When the Leclerc program 
was launched, there were plans to order between 1,100 and 1,400 
tanks. But Leclerc is so costly (more than 30 million French 
francs [Fr] per tank) that the army must reduce its acquisition 
plans by more than 50 percent in the new military programming 
bill.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Gallois by Dominique Garraud; place </F>
and date not given: "General Gallois: `We Must Not Be the 
Mercenaries of Europe'" -- first paragraph is LIBERATION 
introduction] 
  [Text] In 1956, General Pierre-Marie Gallois was one of the 
founders of France's nuclear deterrence doctrine. Now aged 82, 
he is still a leading expert on military strategy. He will run 
in the European elections on the voting list headed by [former 
Socialist Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement. In the 
wake of the government's defenese white paper presented last 
month, General Gallois is soon to publish his own version: 
"Black Paper on Defense" (Footnote) (Payot Essays, 85 French 
francs) 
  [Garraud] France is today the only West European country 
actually increasing its military spending. Is this a worthy 
priority? 
  [Gallois] I would have preferred the spending to be devoted 
to improving and perfecting military technology for the 
essential task of keeping France out of war situations through a 
policy of intimidation. The white paper proposed a 
"long-distance intervention force" taken from a stock of 130,000 
men capable of intervening 7,000 km from France. Even with the 
assistance of our allies, that would require considerable 
resources. It is an excessive ambition, unless we accept 
becoming the mercenary force of the Europe under construction, a 
role that I would not like at all. 
  In the past 12 years, France has mounted or participated in 
25 military intervention. During this time, our European 
partners have invested in vocational training, scientific 
research, economic and industrial development, the environment, 
and improving living conditions. The question is whether we 
have the resources to continue in this way. 
  [Garraud] What, in your opinion, should France's military 
priorities be? 
  [Gallois] Today, public opinion will no longer tolerate 
military intervention in which involves losses, which would 
quickly be considered excessive. That is why the only policy I 
can envisage is one of intimidation. France should strive to 
develop long-distance weapons, which can be operated without 
endangering the lifes of the people who serve them. 
  With so-called "intelligent" weapons, the combatant becomes 
more of a director than an actor. I do not think this change 
has been understood. 
  [Garraud] What implications should such a change have for 
the 
military programming law? 
  [Gallois] In absolute terms, all major programs designed for 
the Cold War should be downscaled so as to open up new avenues 
of research. For example, when you compare the Rafale with the 
American F117 bomber, it is clear that the latter is stealthy, 
whereas the former is not. The airplane should now be viewed 
more as a way of getting weapons airborne than as an actual 
combat machine in its own right. It is the intelligent missile 
that should do all the long-distance destruction, the plane 
having turned tail for home a long time before. To date, we 
have not taken this view. We invest money in the plane rather 
than the missile. That is a conceptional error. The Leclerc 
tank is a traditional land army tank, but it is not suited to 
the current circumstances. What good is a maneuver force today? 
We have to take new directions. 
  [Garraud] Your priority remains the nuclear deterrent. How 
do you see this evolving? 
  [Gallois] We have to keep the strategic oceanic force, which 
is almost invulnerable. I would add several submarines with 
much more accurate, very-low-power ballistic missiles. In this 
way, we could intervene at great distances from France without 
having to massively deploy conventional forces, as the United 
States did for the Gulf war. 
  Another component, although not absolutely essential, is a 
mobile weapons system based in France and consisting of 
double-capacity ballistic missiles, such as the Pershing 2's. 
These would be accurate and could take nuclear or conventional 
warheads. In this way, we could confine the belt of instability 
which is taking shape from Japan, across North Africa, to 
Argentina and Brazil. Many of the countries in this belt have 
ballistic missiles and we must have the means of deterring 
anyone from using the slightest element of blackmail against us. 
These countries must say to themselves: "If we use these 
weapons, we run the risk being replied to in kind." 
  [Garraud] To modernize the deterrent, do we still need to 
carry out nuclear tests? 
  [Gallois] Nuclear testing should be restarted. If we decide 
to stop testing definitively, as the president of the Republic 
has said, we will be taking a tremendous risk. The American 
experts themselves say that these tests must be continued, if 
only to check the quality of weapons as they get older. This 
cannot be done by simulation. A limited amount of testing will 
always be needed. 
  [Garraud] You also recommend that we acquire an extremely 
expensive antimissile defense system. How can we do this in 
the current context of budget constraint? 
  [Gallois] I would put it in a collective European context. 
Certain things that ensure our security and reinforce our 
scientific capabilities can be done at the national level, but 
there are technologies that we cannot acquire because they are 
out of range of our resources. Similarly, if the Europeans 
decide on long-distance interventions, clearly the corresponding 
fleets of cargo and transport planes can only be put together 
collectively. 
  This should be included as a conditional section in the 
military programming law. What I do not like about the White 
Paper is that it assumes that other countries will agree with 
our scenarios.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Alessandro Caprettini; place and date not given: "The 
Interior Ministry? We Will Get it"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Caprettini] Mr. Bossi, 
can you tell us what your expectations are in relation to the 
government which will soon be formed? 
  [Bossi] Mind you, it will not be formed immediately. We must 
wait at least until 25 April before we can begin, right? 
  [Caprettini] If you say so... But does the League have any 
suggestions to make to Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] We are saying that we cannot waste the electoral 
victory. The government will have to get busy to get the 
changes we have envisaged under way. Otherwise... 
  [Caprettini] Does the change include the federalist 
prerequisite being fulfilled within a few months? 
  [Bossi] Of course, the federalist prerequisite still stands. 
However, this must be implemented without frightening people. 
If people are scared, we will achieve the opposite of what we 
want. In any case, we will find the right solution within a 
reasonable timeframe. 
  [Caprettini] Tell us, Mr. Bossi, what about the ministers? 
Have you already put forward your requests? What are your 
requests? 
  [Bossi] We have not yet started discussing the government. 
We are dealing with other matters. As far as the composition 
of the ministries is concerned we have not made any requests. 
Everybody is keeping silent on the subject, perhaps because 
each party is preparing the cards that must be played at the 
right moment. 
  [Caprettini] What about your cards, Mr. Bossi. Are they 
ready? 
  [Bossi] Of course. 
  [Caprettini] I am not asking you to show them now, but could 
you at least tell us what sort of game you will be playing? 
  [Bossi] Well, clearly we cannot ask for all the ministries, 
but some are... so to speak... at the top of the list. 
  [Caprettini] Let me phrase the question another way: Did 
Berlusconi accept your request concerning antitrust legislation? 
  [Bossi] Of course he accepted it. Liberalism and federalism 
are the hubs of our involvement. If they are missing... The 
problem, at this stage, is that whoever supervises these two 
areas must be credible. He must be convinced of the need for 
action. Therefore... 
  [Caprettini] In short, have you secured the post of deputy 
prime minister for Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor 
leader], or not? 
  [Bossi] This matter is still uncertain. However, we will be 
putting forward specific requests. 
  [Caprettini] It is rumored that these will concern, among 
other things, the Interior Ministry. 
  [Bossi] Well, clearly the Interior Ministry cannot be taken 
over by someone from National Alliance, nor can it go to a 
former DC [Christian Democratic Party] member. That leaves us 
and Forza Italia. We will see... taking also into account the 
fact that the Interior Ministry includes the problem of local 
government (Bossi was referring to the ministry's central office 
controlling local government -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note). 
This is why we must first understand whether it will be 
possible to reform the ministry itself. 
  [Caprettini] There is a lot of talk about purportedly 
external experts for important ministries -- the Interior 
Ministry, but also the Budget Ministry, for which Dini's name is 
being mentioned. 
  [Bossi] Technicians? Nonsense! What we need is politicians. 
As far as the Budget Ministry is concerned, we have a name 
ready: Gianfranco Pagliarini. 
  [Caprettini] What do you think of the possibility of 
entrusting some of the parliamentary committees, say the 
bicameral committees, to the opposition? 
  [Bossi] I think that these committees must be entrusted to 
the party which is the best guarantor of democratic rules, 
namely the League. 
  [Caprettini] Mr. Bossi, what are you requesting, in short, 
from Berlusconi in order to join the government? 
  [Bossi] We can make many requests, but this is not the real 
issue. The question is not quantity, though in this respect we 
could also make ourselves heard, but rather the quality of our 
presence. We must not waste the electoral victory.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "`Ministers From Outside Our </F>
Ranks Too'; Berlusconi Looks `Beyond' Majority"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- "I hope that it will be possible to 
implement properly Article 92 [of the Constitution], which 
asserts the prime minister-designate's full responsibility for 
choosing the government team. And I hope I will be able to 
depend on ministers from outside the majority too, both men and 
women. But for the present there are no definite names; the 
ones that I have seen in the newspapers are fruits of the 
imagination..." The only certainty is that Silvio Berlusconi, 
interviewed by journalists outside his house yesterday evening, 
is furious with Mario Segni [Pact for Italy leader], (who 
ironically was at that very moment issuing an official 
communique declaring his "close attention" to Berlusconi). He 
said: "That fellow says all kinds of things; nothing of what he 
says corresponds to the truth. Segni questions himself and 
provides his own answers. There have been no approaches to him, 
and we do not intend to make any... With regard to the Popular 
Party [PPI], we remain open to a dialogue... And as for De 
Mita, who demanded a rejection of the National Alliance, my 
reply is that ours is a compact alignment, and we are people who 
concern themselves with specifics. We have obtained the Italian 
people's support and we will govern. We will not have any 
second thoughts. Of course, I have discovered that politics has 
a pace of its own, which is different from what I thought." 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, attorney Vittorio Dotti has gained the post of 
deputy speaker of the lower house; the decision was made 
yesterday afternoon. Berlusconi appreciates the cooperation of 
his allies. He feels more secure with his lawyer at the head of 
the lower house. And the Justice Ministry remains free... 
"There is time," Berlusconi said yesterday morning. "How long 
it takes to form the government will depend on the consultations 
that will be started in the next few days by the president and 
on his decisions. For our part, if we have responsibilities as 
the pole for freedom, it will take time to decide. We will not 
follow the principle of the spoils system. I do not think that 
speed is the most important thing." 
  We will not follow the principle of the spoils system. That 
means that no one can yet be certain of being appointed. No one 
knows what hat he will wear and what role he will play. The 
only certainties, apart from the top positions of Berlusconi, 
Tatarella, and Maroni, are that Berlusconi wants Cesare Previti 
as his right-hand man at the Interior Ministry (or the Justice 
Ministry, as a second choice). That he definitely wants to find 
another position for Tiziana Parenti, if not in the government, 
then in one of the most important of the parliamentary 
committees (perhaps the Anti-Mafia Committee) which commands 
definite prestige and a prominent image. That he attaches great 
importance to a Family Ministry and very much hopes that his 
program can receive the approval of a sector of the PPI. This 
morning he will officially offer them a deputy speakership of 
the lower house and the chairmanship of important committees in 
the lower house and the Senate. Also today Berlusconi will meet 
with Marco Pannella, and will ask him directly to choose: Forza 
Italia can offer him a post as EC commissioner for himself 
and/or the chairmanship of the television watchdog committee for 
Mario Taradash. "There are only six of them and they want seven 
things..." one of the officials in charge of the negotiations 
commented drily. 
  The League and the National Alliance do not want Pannella in 
the government (as they confirmed yesterday very clearly) and 
Berlusconi cannot do much to change their minds. Another 
obstacle being dealt with confidentially is the issue of whether 
the former Christian Democrats of the CCD [Christian Democratic 
Center] should enter the government. There are those who are 
not in favor of granting a prominent position to Clemente 
Mastella (who said: "I have no government ambitions; all I want 
to do is to engage in politics..." However, he added 
resentfully: "But it must be clearly understood that we will 
not accept any prejudices.") "Thoroughbred" League members will 
not accept on the team anyone too easily identified with 
previous majorities,. "but Clemente is such a nice fellow; 
everybody likes him..." according to Forza Italia members. 
However, the final decision lies with the likely prime 
minister. Meanwhile, it is certain that Mastella will be the 
CCD's lower house floor leader. When it comes to sharing one 
post between two, there will be problems for the Liberals, too. 
Some members of the majority have made two calculations: "Three 
Liberals have been elected -- Scognamiglio, Costa, and Biondi. 
We cannot have all three of them in the country's 
leadership..." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Mario Segni, leader of the Pact for </F>
Italy, by Bruno Vespa on 21 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Vespa] Mr. Segni, it seems that everyone is 
sticking to their position. Some of you, a small number, want 
to abstain from voting against the government, while the 
majority want to be in opposition. 
  [Segni] Yes, that is the situation. A Berlusconi government 
is being viewed in different ways. Of course, that does not 
prevent us from working together in parliament or looking to the 
forthcoming European elections. 
  [Vespa] But if the four MP's who want to abstain from voting 
against Berlusconi do abstain, will they be allowed to stay in 
the Pact for Italy or will they be thrown out? 
  [Segni] We will deal with this if it occurs; I do not know 
what would happen. However, the important thing is to explain 
the reasons for our positions concerning Berlusconi. It is not 
a preconceived position. There are some matters which must be 
settled before a favorable judgment can be made.

<F P=106> ["R.S." report: "Northern League: `False Accusations'"] </F>
  [Text] Milan -- He [Clean Hands public prosecutor Di 
Pietro] busted the five-party coalition wide open and evicted 
the League from the ranks of the honest. He also made it clear 
that the PCI- PDS [Italian Communist Party-Democratic Party of 
the Left], though temporarily reprieved through lack of 
evidence, would also get it in the neck. While the Bottegone 
[PDS headquarters] is refraining, at least for the time being, 
from answering back, the bandwagon [League nickname] is shooting 
pointblank against Italy's most famous public prosecutor. The 
latter, the champion of the thief hunt, the magistrate who had 
always been incited by the League, yesterday shot them down in 
flames by indicating that the League had also eaten a slice of 
bribe city pie. 
  A communique which the League immediately issued yesterday 
started by saying: "We did not behave like the others." It 
then attempted to refute the accusations made by the public 
prosecutor in his final report. This was the first strike. In 
a TV broadcast, Di Pietro publicized a copy of a letter signed 
by League Forli section secretary Bellettini -- a letter 
requesting a meeting between [League Secretary] Bossi and 
[former Enimont official] Carlo Sama. "This was," the 
communique pointed out, "a request for publicity, which 
Bellettini thought could be made more official by speaking of a 
`private meeting.'" There is, then, the question of the 200 
million lire received by [League official] Alessandro Patelli. 
In the hearing, the League complained, Di Pietro forgot to 
mention Bossi's "counterstatements" (whereby the bandwagon's 
leader made known the decision to hand over the 200 million lire 
to the magistrate). "Among other things," the communique went 
on to say, "this amount was stolen by the `usual unidentified 
persons,' who broke into the League's headquarters a few hours 
later because they, or their instigators, were hoping that this 
would lead to a denunciation which would stir up a scandal on 
the eve of the 1992 general elections." In any case, the 200 
million lire cannot be considered a bribe: "No exchange of 
favors on the League's part was involved. If anything, this was 
a simple administrative misdemeanor, which can be defined as a 
donation that was not entered in the accounts and that therefore 
could be subject only to a fine." 
  However, it is one of Di Pietro's sentences ("The League 
behaved like all the other parties") which made League 
supporters go into a rage. In their view, this was clearly "a 
political consideration, which would undermine the basic 
objectivity of any legal proceeding, and certainly of this one 
in particular." They explained their reasons by means of a 
theorem: "If the League had behaved like everybody else, bribe 
city would have never exploded." The indignant conclusion was: 
"Di Pietro should think things over." League Deputy Marcello 
Lazzati stressed the point: "There is nothing new. The League 
has nothing to do with all this and anyone saying the opposite 
is making assertions which are not only slanderous but also 
historically false."

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Bundestag </F>
session in Bonn on 13 April] 
  [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen. In his 
eulogy for the victims of the terrible act of arson in Solingen 
on 3 June 1993, President von Weizsaecker correctly described 
German-Turkish relations as friendship between peoples. This 
friendship has a long and exemplary tradition. It is an 
important commodity for us, in foreign policy terms and in human 
terms. The Federal Government has a firm desire to care for 
this commodity also in difficult times. 
  Close cooperation with Turkey is no special interest of 
Germany's. Rather, it is a common objective of NATO and the 
European Union [EU]. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and 
the transformations in Central and East Europe, Turkey has 
gained even greater significance as a bridgehead between Europe 
and Asia and as a stabilizing factor within the Muslim world, 
and it requires solidarity particularly now. 
  Prime Minister Ciller has just announced an economic 
stabilization program that calls for harsh measures and 
sacrifices. At the same time, the country is being put to the 
test by the strengthening of Islam. The Iraqi Kurd leader 
Talabani, with whom I am due to hold talks this evening, has 
just said that he considers the "growing fundamentalism" in 
Turkey "a common threat both to the Kurds and to the Turkish 
Government." 
  But, Ladies and Gentlemen, friendly relations, such as the 
ones we maintain vis-a-vis Turkey, also involve the need for 
each side to inform the other side as friend and partner about 
any problems that exist. In this context, it must be said that 
the situation with human rights and that of the Kurdish 
population in Turkey is not satisfactory. On the contrary, the 
situation has deteriorated. The EU admitted the same thing in a 
31 March 1994 declaration on the subject of human rights in 
Turkey. 
  This declaration was brought on by lifting parliamentary 
immunity and arresting Kurdish deputies in the Turkish 
Parliament at the beginning of March. Immediately after 
receiving confirmation of the first reports on this subject, the 
Federal Government pointed out that measures against freely 
elected members of the Turkish Parliament create the impression 
that the voice of the Kurdish population in Turkey is being 
suppressed. 
  Both bilaterally and on an EU level, we have expressed our 
expectations that the Kurdish deputies will be permitted to 
avail themselves of their constitutional rights. In this 
connection, the Federal Government trusts in the impartiality of 
Turkish justice. 
  With Douglas Hurd, my British colleague, on 20 January I 
held 
a frank discussion with my colleague Cetin, who is himself a 
Kurd, and with whom I happen to have been in touch over the past 
few days, and still am. A recurrent subject of our talks is the 
situation with the Christians and Yezidis, torture during police 
custody, and restrictions on the freedom of speech and opinion. 
  So that there are no misunderstandings, Ladies and 
Gentlemen: 
The Federal Government naturally considers combating the 
terrorist Kurdish Workers Party to be legitimate. But even 
combating terrorism must adhere to the framework of the rule of 
law and the norms of human rights that Turkey has also 
recognized. 
  The Federal Government believes, and we have said so again 
and again in our talks, that the Kurdish issue, which is a 
problem not only in Turkey, can only be resolved by peaceful 
means and in mutual agreement between the Turkish Government and 
the Kurds. Such a solution must respect and guarantee the 
cultural identity of the Kurdish population. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen. In response to the accusation that 
the Federal Government is permitting German-supplied weapons to 
be used against the Kurdish population, the following has to be 
said. Turkey has been receiving defense aid from Germany since 
1964. This was and is based on a NATO Council recommendation. 
In this way, Germany fulfilled and still fulfills its allied 
commitment and has contributed and is still contributing to a 
consolidation of the NATO southern flank for the sake of the 
security of all of us. The aid I have just mentioned expires in 
1994. 
  In addition to defense aid, Turkey is receiving material 
aid, 
in other words supplies of surplus goods, mainly from the stocks 
of the former National People's Army. Because of the Gulf war, 
supplies worth a total of 1.5 billion marks [DM] were foreseen, 
out of which DM290.9 million worth of goods are still to be 
delivered in 1994. No further supplies are envisaged after that. 
  Special aid for armaments was agreed upon in 1988. It has 
been implemented, with the exception of a delivery of DM5.1 
million. 
  In all these agreements and deliveries, Turkey committed 
itself to use the supplied weapons and other materiel solely in 
accordance with Article 5 of the NATO treaty, i.e. in defense 
against an armed attack. Following the deliveries embargo 
introduced by the Federal Government on 26 March 1992, and after 
my visit to Turkey on 2 June 1992, the Turkish Government 
affirmed this commitment in an exchange of correspondence. 
  Turkey has vehemently rejected the latest accusations about 
a 
use of German weapons that is in breach of the treaty. It did 
so, for instance, in a letter from Foreign Minister Cetin dated 
7 April, after I had reminded him yet again, orally and in 
writing, to adhere to previous Turkish pledges. At the same 
time, the Federal Government decided to postpone a delivery 
scheduled for 15 April until such time as an investigation into 
these accusations had been completed. 
  The Federal Government has adopted this line because it 
takes 
its responsibility seriously. The political director of the 
Foreign Ministry held an exhaustive conversation with a 
representation of various German human rights organizations 
yesterday. The photographic material and other evidence that he 
was given will now be carefully examined by experts, just as in 
every single alleged case of violations until now. 
  Since 1992, since the exchange of correspondence I mentioned 
earlier, I have contacted my Turkish colleague four or five 
times following reports about violations of agreements, and I 
have discussed this whole subject matter with him dozens of 
times, at every single meeting with him. However, we have never 
been presented with any conclusive evidence. 
  Let me repeat that the photographic material and 
instructions 
that we were given yesterday are going to be carefully checked. 
However, for the time being I do not dispose of any material 
that could in any way confirm what has been alleged. Obviously, 
I cannot issue any final statement before the material has been 
analyzed. I will wait for this analysis, and act with care and 
restraint. 
  Nevertheless, as foreign minister of this country, I insist 
on the following. As long as the accusations are not proven, 
the Federal Government has no reason to doubt the detailed 
assurances of a friendly allied partner about adherence to the 
treaty. 
  Turkey points out to us, via its foreign minister and 
defense 
minister, also orally and in writing, and in several telephone 
calls, that materiel formerly belonging to the National People's 
Army is indeed deployed in southeast Turkey, but is merely used 
to secure the borders, especially the borders with Iraq and 
Syria. At the same time, Turkey tells us that similar materiel 
has also been supplied by Russia, and in increased quantities. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, on 10 November 1993 I appealed from 
this rostrum to all the Kurds living in Germany: "Do not spread 
your conflict to Germany. Do not think that violence is the way 
to achieve legitimate goals, such as the protection of human 
rights in your country!" For the sake of the Federal Republic, 
I repeat this appeal here and now with all due seriousness and 
emphasis. 
  Just like all the approximately 2 million Turkish citizens 
living here in Germany, the several hundred thousand Kurds are 
welcome guests and joint citizens in this country. They can be 
assured of our care. 
  But obviously, one of the basic principles of hospitality 
that applies in every country on earth also applies here: He 
who takes advantage of this hospitality must respect the law and 
order of his host country. The Federal Government will not 
tolerate violations of the law and violence in Germany, from 
whatever quarter and for whatever motives. We reject violent 
clashes in our country with as much determination as we support 
the protection of human and ethnic minority rights worldwide. 
  He who abuses the right of abode in Germany and becomes 
punishable must expect to feel the full force of our laws and be 
deported. Of course, every single case will be examined to make 
sure that the person concerned is not in danger of a death 
sentence or torture or other illegitimate treatment. Germany is 
and remains a law-governed country. We are proud of that. 
  Turkey has signed the Geneva Refugee Convention, the 
European 
Human Rights Convention, and the UN Torture Convention. We are 
making an effort concerning further such legal instruments. On 
the other hand, we have not forgotten Moelln and Solingen. I 
said so at the open graves of the dead in Turkey. This must 
also be reiterated today, the day of the commencement of the 
trial of the people allegedly responsible. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, German relations with Turkey have 
possessed and continue to possess great value for us. Therefore 
it is all the more important that we intensify our critical, but 
also partner-like, dialogue with our Turkish friends. 
  I ask everyone to whom the fate of all men, in Turkey and in 
Germany, is dear, to remember that friendship between peoples is 
not automatic. It is a valuable commodity. In the future too, 
the Federal Government's policies, especially our relations with 
Turkey, will be geared to this fact.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundestag today began to 
debate the new world trade agreement which promises Germany 
higher standards of living in the medium term. A week ago in 
Marrakesh, the member states of the GATT signed the agreement, 
which took seven and a half years to negotiate. 
  The agreement stipulates a 37-percent reduction in customs 
duties as well as the opening up of markets to foreign products 
and services. The German Government intends officially to apply 
that Bonn be the location of the new World Trade Organization 
(WTO). The WTO will replace GATT, which was founded in 1947, on 
1 January. 
  In a government statement, German Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party) welcomed the new world trade 
agreement as a "milestone in trade policy." The export-oriented 
German economy, on which every third job depends, will profit 
from the agreement even if follow-up negotiations are still 
required in individual cases. 
  The agreement shows that countries want free trade and are 
ready to take on structural changes. The walls of protectionism 
belong to the past, said Rexrodt. At the same time, the 
minister underlined that Bonn is a serious candidate for the 
seat of the WTO due to its position and infrastructure. His 
ministry is therefore preparing its bid.

<F P=106> [Report by Christoph Rabe: "The Foreign Trade Structure in </F>
China Leaves a Lot To Be Desired"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- The Asia-Pacific Committee of the 
German Economy (APA) has directed an urgent appeal to the 
government to provide an amount of funds to promote trade in the 
Asia-Pacific region that corresponds to this region's 
significance. That is the only way the government's Asian trade 
concepts can be implemented. Until now, a stronger concentration 
of economic and political resources on Asia has never involved 
an increase in funds. 
  As an introduction to the Asia-Pacific Conference of German 
Industry due to be held in Bangkok on 25-26 April, the seven 
working circles set up within APA have submitted a preliminary 
report on their work. On the subject of the "further 
development of foreign trade instruments," APA complains 
particularly about the case of China. Germany's foreign trade 
infrastructure vis-a-vis China, measured in terms of market 
potential and the ability to make use of it, leaves a lot to be 
desired, says APA. 
  Despite their heavy commitment, German embassies and 
consulates are no longer able to offer proper services to 
enterprises involved in Chinese trade. Therefore, APA wants to 
see an expansion of the foreign trade structure in the PRC. As 
far as the other countries in this region are concerned, the 
foreign trade infrastructure in purely quantitative terms 
conforms more or less to requirements. 
  However, APA notes a deficiency in cooperation between 
German 
diplomatic facilities on the one hand and foreign trade chambers 
and missions on the other. Cooperation between the federation 
and the laender in the foreign trade sphere also needs 
improvement. The Federation-Laender Committee obviously has 
only limited possibilities of effectively coordinating trade, 
says APA. Germany's politicians should be informed of foreign 
trade requirements more clearly and comprehensively. APA notes 
with interest that the Economics Ministry will be holding a 
hearing on the subject of German involvement in Asia-Pacific 
trade and that trade unions are also invited to it. 
  APA wants to check whether the funds "that are generously 
available for East Europe but are not being utilized there" 
could be used for Asia-Pacific trade instead. There is also 
maneuvering space concerning development aid. According to APA 
circle dealing with "political support," this aid still offers 
opportunities to promote German business interests without 
neglecting development objectives. The training of work forces 
from the development countries is also considered expedient. 
  APA also sees room for improvement in other areas of 
training. The personnel currently available for the Asia-Pacific 
region are either specialized in a specific country and language 
or they possess specific economic and technical qualifications. 
But what is required is a combination of both. Therefore APA 
wants to see enterprise personnel receive more practical 
training concerning all aspects of Asia, and a personnel policy 
that is geared more closely to this region. A data bank on 
existing educational possibilities, a list of criteria for Asia 
specialists, and a job placement service for this region are 
also desirable. 
  To increase German involvement in Asia, APA wants to see 
additional "German Centers" erected in countries of key 
significance. These centers are an efficient way of providing 
the host country with a "clear and comprehensive picture of 
Germany's economic potential" and help German firms establish 
markets for their products. The Federal Government should, 
therefore, coordinate the establishment of such centers and 
provide the funds. A "Fund for the Development of German Centers 
Abroad" is also feasible. 
  In addition, to promote German competitiveness in Asia, APA 
recommends the following: 
  -- Harmonization of export control regulations concerning 
dual-use goods; 
  -- Improvement of the Hermes mechanism; 
  -- An investigation of the use of state consulting services 
in the acquisition of projects; 
  -- Removal of competition barriers when financing exports 
within the framework of an OECD consensus; 
  -- More national and international consortiums; 
  -- More support for medium-sized industry; 
  -- Faster European Union [EU] involvement in the development 
of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The APA circle responsible for matters concerning 
competition 
views Germany's duty presidency of the EU Council in the second 
half of 1994 as a good opportunity to present recommendations 
about harmonizing European regulations. 
  APA has carried out a survey on business opportunities in 
selected countries (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, 
Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand) to try and establish to what 
extent firms and investors are free to set up business there, 
what restrictions German firms might be exposed to, how these 
countries treat their own citizens who operate businesses, what 
kind of tariff and nontariff barriers there are to trade, and 
what kind of protection is offered to private property. 
  The survey revealed that Japan, Taiwan, and Malaysia have 
the 
most liberal conditions. India, Indonesia, South Korea, and 
Thailand possess the greatest obstacles concerning access to 
their markets. APA wants to extend this survey to Vietnam and 
also include the sphere of taxation and finance. Information on 
access to all these markets should be available from the 
Association of German Industry and the East Asia Association. 
  In addition, to make matters concerning the Asia-Pacific 
region clearer, the East Asia Association wants to publish 
informative literature on this region and organize a symposium 
in September entitled "Doing Business With Southeast Asia."

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Deputy Chairwoman Heidemarie </F>
Wieczorek-Zeul by Ingo Preissler; place and date not given: "No 
Army for Intervention"] 
  [Text] [Preissler] The Social Democratic Party [SPD] has 
welcomed the NATO air strike against the Bosnian Serbs, but it 
rejects Bundeswehr participation in similar United Nations 
operations. How do these two things go together? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] First of all: We all think that a 
political solution must be found for former Yugoslavia. Second, 
all parties in Germany, including those in government, think 
that German troops have no business in former Yugoslavia. 
Third, the SPD government program says: Providing the relevant 
amendment to the constitution is made, we could participate in 
UN peacekeeping missions. But we do not want the Bundeswehr to 
be used as an army for military interventions worldwide. 
  [Preissler] Does this mean that the SPD rejects peacemaking 
missions? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] These are combat missions. Neither the 
United States, nor the United Nations -- as we learned during 
Butrus-Ghali's visit this week -- expect Germany to take part in 
such missions. Anyone in Germany referring to demands "from 
outside," is using this as a pretext for a complete change in 
Bundeswehr arms and equipment. This would cost billions that 
are urgently needed for establishing German unity and supporting 
East Europe. 
  [Preissler] NATO officials and politicians say that it is 
unrealistic to draw a line between peacekeeping missions and 
combat missions. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] Somalia has made the United Nations and the 
U.S. Administration realize once again that unclear mandates are 
dangerous, because they contain the threat of sliding into a 
war. As to the Somalia mission, the Federal Government has told 
the Bundestag and the population a lot of lies. None of the 
originally envisaged aims and conditions have been met. 
  [Preissler] On Tuesday [19 April], the Federal 
Constitutional Court will discuss Bundeswehr missions. You do 
not see any reason to withdraw your complaint? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] No. By the way, the Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] has also filed a complaint in Karlsruhe. But ours is 
credible. Foreign Minister Kinkel will appear two-faced in 
Karlsruhe, for, as foreign minister he will present the 
government's position, and as FDP chairman he will argue against 
himself. The SPD wants a clarification of whether the 
interpretation of the constitution by all former federal 
governments is continued, whereby the Bundeswehr's military 
constitution only provides for the defense of its own country 
and the alliance. Any other use would require a constitutional 
amendment. Regardless of the decision the Karlsruhe court 
takes, the SPD has made it clear that if it takes over the 
government, the Bundeswehr will only be used in blue helmet 
missions. 
  [Preissler] Your chairman has pointed out that there is no 
doubt that the SPD will remain loyal to the alliance. The 
Greens want to abolish NATO. Does this mean the death of a 
red-green coalition? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] We are not speculating about possible 
coalitions before the elections. We want the Social Democrats 
to win as many votes as possible to enable a change of 
government. I consider the position of the Greens to be wrong 
and untrustworthy. They are ignoring the fact that the Central 
and East European countries are very interested in joining NATO.

<F P=106> ["fy." report: "Resistance to Ruehe's Plans in CDU/CSU </F>
Bundestag Group"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn, 20 Apr -- The decision of Defense 
Minister Ruehe to reduce the Bundeswehr strength from 370,000 to 
320,000 men and the basic military service from 12 to 10 months 
was unanimously rejected in the defense working group of the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] 
Bundestag Group on Wednesday [20 April]. In a three-hour 
session, in which, apart from the members of the working group, 
only the minister and his state secretaries, Wilz and Mrs. 
Geiger, participated, almost all working group members took the 
floor. Its chairman, Breuer, made critical comments, just like 
former Parliamentary State Secretary Wuerzbach and the following 
deputies: Hauser, Uehlhoff, Adam, Mrs. Marienfeld, Strobe, 
Augustinowitz, Janovsky, Stockhausen, Ganz, and Kossendey. They 
did not show any understanding for Ruehe's decisions. The 
assessment of the security policy situation in Europe, which 
Ruehe takes as a basis in the recently published white book and 
the "conceptual guidelines" deduced from it, is too positive. 
The situation is far less stable and calculable than it is 
presented. His decision to reduce the basic military service 
from 12 to 10 months is a serious danger for the preservation of 
compulsory military service, it was stated. Some deputies 
expressed the fear that the reduction will pave the way for a 
professional army. 
  At the same time, with the criticism of the material effects 
of Ruehe's planned cuts, members of the Bundestag Group 
expressed the fear that the financial endowment for the 
remaining units will not be improved by the reduction. Rather, 
one has to prepare for the possibility that the finance minister 
will justify further budget cuts by the Bundeswehr's reduction 
and "collect" the savings. Ruehe has not promised that this 
will not happen, it was stated. This fear was not refuted in 
the debate. 
  Ruehe resolutely rejected the criticism of his decisions. He 
referred to the fact that he had made his decision in 
coordination and full agreement with the chancellor. The 
government had adopted the assessment of the security policy 
situation in the white book. The deputies have to accept that, 
he said. The further course of action was also controversial. 
First Ruehe reported that he is no longer prepared to 
participate in the closed meeting that the working group had 
fixed in Siegen for the weekend. After a discussion of half an 
hour, Ruehe took his decision back. However, after the 
three-hour debate, an agreement in Siegen seemed to be unlikely 
to members of the working group. Ruehe also did not make the 
impression that he is once again prepared to strive for an 
improvement of the Bundeswehr's financial means and thus to 
create the prerequisites for the preservation of the Bundeswehr 
strength of 370,000 men. [passage omitted] 
  Before the beginning of the meeting, Ruehe had pointed out 
that nobody gets around "some hard facts." This includes that a 
Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men cannot be maintained with the 
means that are provided by the government. 
  A few days ago, in a speech, State Secretary Schoenbohm made 
it clear how great the cuts in the Bundeswehr budget after 
reunification are. With the inflation rate being taken into 
account, it was reduced by 18 percent from 1989 to 1993, next 
year the cuts will amount to 25 percent, that is, one-fourth of 
the amount available in 1989. In this way, the means available 
for materiel and investments decreased by 43 percent until 1993, 
he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenther Pursch, Claudia Schute, Dirk Klose, </F>
Thomas Lillig: "For a Democracy That Is Capable of Defending 
Itself"] 
  [Text] "In 1993, the threat to the FRG's internal security 
from violent left-wing extremists was more serious than in the 
previous year," according to the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV] report presented by Federal 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther in Bonn on 14 April. 
  All left-wing extremists want to abolish the existing state 
and social order. In seeking that, they pursue various 
ideological lines. At the end of 1993, almost 29,000 people 
belonged to a multitude of left-wing extremist organizations and 
groupings. This figure does not include the several thousand 
supporters of the Marxist-Leninist positions assumed by the SED 
[Socialist Unity Party of Germany] successor party, the "Party 
of Democratic Socialism" (PDS). Marxist-Leninists, Trotskyists 
and Marxist revolutionary formations that propagate class 
struggle and revolution have 22,000 members. The anarchists 
have about 6,000 members, including 5,000 independents who are 
prepared to use violence. 
  The most significant terrorist organization, the "Red Army 
Faction" (RAF), have once again demonstrated that it is prepared 
to use violence with the bombing of the prison building at 
Weiterstadt in Hesse. The report states: "The shooting of a 
police official at Bad Kleinen on 27 June during the attempt to 
arrest RAF member Wolfgang Grams showed once more how dangerous 
the underground command level members are." The struggle over 
what direction to adopt, one which became public, was unique for 
the RAF. This finally led to a split between the RAF command 
level and the majority of group members who were in prison and 
ultimately resulted in collapse of the so-called "prisoners 
collective." The report states that there are clear signs of 
"moves to form new terrorist groupings." 
  The "Revolutionary Cells" (RZ) have continued the discussion 
about concepts and conditions for future revolutionary policy. 
A group that has emerged from the RZ has carried out terrorist 
attacks. 
  The BfV officials further conclude that the greatest 
potential for left-wing extremist violence is to be found among 
independent anarchists. "The popularity of these organization 
is continuing to grow." In contrast to independent anarchist 
practice until now, which was based more on spontaneity and 
hostility toward organizations, there are calls now for closer 
coordination and organizational ties. Longer-term associations 
have above all developed as a result of the so-called 
"antifascist" struggle. Independent groupings' readiness to 
engage in violence has not waned. They are responsible for the 
majority of acts of violence that have a left-wing background. 
"Antifascism/antiracism" has remained the main field of 
activity and it has taken the form of militant action against 
right-wing extremists or suspected right-wing extremists and 
their structures as well against the ways in which asylum is 
granted and amendments to asylum legislation. 
  Marxist-Leninist and other revolutionary Marxist 
organizations have to a large extent assumed a more stable 
character. By means of "antifascism" and campaigning for social 
issues, they hope -- with only modest success -- to mobilize and 
attract those concerned. According to the report, their 
readiness to cooperate, extensively without ideological 
reservations, with both elements from the independent scene and 
those from RAF circles is "remarkable." The revolutionary 
Marxists are focussing their attention on election year 1994. 
They hope to improve their election prospects through links to 
parties, alliances, and "open lists." Sections of the PDS are 
also considering such moves. 
  According to the findings of the BfV officials, a 
Marxist-Leninist association, the "Communist Platform" (KPF), 
has consolidated its position within the PDS with the party's 
knowledge and approval. It openly espouses the "revolutionary 
idea of the socialist alternative." The report states that PDS 
speaker Hanno Harnisch confirmed that the KPF does not want to 
throw all the theoretical principles of communism overboard and 
takes a "glorified" view of the history of socialism to some 
extent. In June 1993, a representative of this tendency was 
elected to the PDS Federal Board. The KPF also sees itself as a 
bridge to other communist groupings. In an interview with the 
DKP [German Communist Party] newspaper UNSERE ZEIT, PDS chairman 
Lothar Bisky indicated that communists, including DKP members, 
would be able to appear as candidates on the open PDS lists for 
the 1994 elections. While the PDS has distanced itself from the 
"Stalinist" MLPD [Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany], it has "no 
reservations about contacts with violent extremists such as the 
independents." 
  According to the 1993 findings, no progress is being made in 
efforts to build a unified communist party for Germany. 
However, revolutionary Marxist organizations maintain active 
contacts with each other and with the PDS. Closer ties have 
emerged between the "Union of West German Communists" (BWK) and 
the PDS, but not between the "German Communist Party" (DKP), the 
PDS "Communist Platform," and the "Communist Party of Germany," 
(KPD, based in Berlin) which was still founded in the days of 
the GDR. 

<H5>    Right-Wing Extremism </H5>
  The total number of organized and nonorganized right-wing 
extremists hardly changed compared to 1992: According to the 
BfV report, at the end of 1993, there were about 42,400 (42,700 
in 1992) right-wing extremists in the FRG as well as 77 (82 in 
1992) extremist right-wing organizations and other associations. 
After making deductions for multiple membership, a total of 
about 41,500 (41,900) right-wing extremists belong to these 
organizations, including 5,600 (6,400 in 1992) militants, 
particularly skinheads. About 950 (800 in 1992) neo-Nazis are 
not members of organized associations. 
  There has been a slight decline in the overall number of 
right-wing extremist acts of violence: It was established that 
a total of 2,232 such offenses -- about 15 percent fewer than in 
1992 (2,639) -- were committed in 1993. Of that number, 1,609 
(2,277 in 1992) were motivated by hostility toward foreigners. 
According to the Interior Ministry, the decline is due to the 
resolute measures taken by the state, extending from greater 
efforts on the part of the police force and the prosecution 
service to the rapid conclusion of criminal proceedings. The 
end of the debate on asylum has also caused the wave of violence 
to subside. 
  However, the total number of violations of the law by 
right-wing extremists has risen by 37 percent to 10,561 offenses 
(7,684 in 1992). The report attributes the increase to a 
greater readiness on the part of the population to report 
offenses as well as police measures aimed "at bringing light 
into the darkness." 
  The neo-Nazi scene has been made to feel "very uncertain" by 
the seven bans on extremist right-wing associations that have 
been imposed by interior ministries at the federal and laender 
levels as well as numerous investigations and searches. 
Applications for bans have been filed with the Federal 
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe against two parties ("Liberal 
German Workers Party," FAP, and the "National List," NL). In 
February and July 1993, law enforcement measures were 
implemented throughout the country against skinhead bands and 
music companies as well as the producers and distributors of 
right-extremist scene publications. Efforts by activists of 
banned organizations to form new structures have only be 
established in isolated cases. For example, supporters of the 
"German Alternative" (DA) have tried to establish a new 
organization called the "German Nationalists" (DN), which is 
being kept under constant surveillance by the security 
authorities. 
  Despite cooperation, right-wing extremist activities are 
clearly fragmented at the regional level: While the FAP is 
particularly active in North Rhine-Westphalia and the new 
laender, the NL, which was formed by supporters of neo-Nazi 
leader Michael Kuehnen, who died in 1991, concentrates on 
Hamburg. The "Direct Action/Central Germany" (JF), which has 
been active since later summer 1993, is primarily involved in 
neo-Nazi and social revolutionary propaganda in Brandenburg and 
Berlin. The "Relief Organization for National Political 
Prisoners and their Dependents" has been shown to be a "rallying 
point for neo-Nazis." With about 200 members, it is has one of 
the largest memberships among neo-Nazi associations on the 
right-wing extremist scene, which is greatly fragmented 
organizationally. 

<H5>    Extremism Among Foreigners </H5>
  Acts of violence committed by foreign extremists and 
foreigners associations still pose a "considerable" threat to 
the security of the FRG. Despite a slight drop in the number of 
members and supporters of such associations, the security 
situation in Germany has not been "defused," states the BfV 
report in its chapter on foreigners. The acts of violence 
committed in 1993 by foreign extremists rose to 66 (53 in 1992); 
five people died as a result. 
  According to the BfV authorities, at the end of 1993, 38,950 
(39,800 in 1992) people belonged to "foreigners' associations 
that were actively extremist or considerably influenced by 
extremism," including 6,800 supporters of organizations from the 
"Kurdish and Turkish areas of observation" that are banned in 
Germany. Turkish and Kurdish extremism is the most prevalent: 
The BfV also mentions 1,750 Arabs, 1,300 Iranians, and 2,500 
others. 
  In 1993, a total of 195 acts (141 in 1992) of violence were 
registered. They included 66 (53) serious acts of violence such 
as offenses, bombings, arson attacks. The most common act of 
violence (60 offenses) among the remaining 129 offenses is 
damage to property involving the considerable use of force. 
  The BfV describes the "Workers Party of Kurdistan" (PKK), -- 
it was banned in Germany in November 1993 -- which is seeking an 
independent Kurdish state and, according to the report, is 
openly waging a terrorist campaign against the Turkish state, as 
"by far the most militant organization" in Germany. Compared to 
previous years, there has been a "marked" increase in the PKK's 
readiness to use violence in Germany and it is linked to the 
escalation of the conflict in Turkey. "Its violent activities 
have assumed increasingly serious forms and have considerably 
impaired German security interests." In this context, the BfV 
report mentions the PKK attack on the Turkish Consulate General 
in Munich --a trial is currently in progress -- and 50 attacks 
on Turkish facilities in numerous German towns. In addition, 
the PKK has collected money in Germany for the struggle in 
Turkey "partially by using blackmail." 
  The report also includes under Turkish extremism the 
left-wing extremist organization "Revolutionary Left" (Devrimci 
Sol), which was also banned in 1993, the Turkish "Communist 
Party" (Marxist-Leninist), the Islamic extremist "Association of 
Islamic Associations and Communities" (ICCB) in Cologne, the 
Islamic "Association for a New World View in Europe" (AMGT). 
The last two groupings have about 19,000 members. 
  The Gaza-Jericho accord between Israel and the PLO has also 
prompted very differing reactions among the Palestinians living 
in Germany. For example, in leaflets distributed in Germany, 
the "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine" has been 
sharply critical of the agreement and emphatically rejected it. 
The "Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine" has 
expressed itself in similar terms. 
  In the case of extremism among Iranians, the BfV draws a 
distinction between supporters and opponents of the present 
Iranian Government. With regard to the latter, it has been 
established that the collapse and organizational and ideological 
disorientation of the Iranian opposition is continuing. 
  The only opposition group worth mentioning is the social 
revolutionary "Organization of the People's Mojahedin of Iran," 
whose supporters have also engaged in "vociferous propaganda" at 
several larger demonstrations in Germany. On the subject of the 
conflict between the peoples of former Yugoslavia, the report 
states that in 1993 in Germany, there were "threats and physical 
violence" on a massive scale including murder (20 March 1993 in 
Kehl in Baden- Wuerttemberg). In general, it is possible to 
ascertain a radicalization among the Bosnian Moslems living in 
Germany. 
  The number of periodicals distributed in the FRG by 
extremist 
foreigners associations fell from 96 (1992) to 68. Fifty-four 
of them were published by extremist left-wing groups, 11 by 
extremist Islamic organizations, and three by extreme 
nationalist groups. 
  In connection with extremism on the part of foreigners, the 
BfV points out "that the overwhelming majority of the more than 
6 million fellow foreign citizens reject extremist behavior and 
do not want to be involved with extremist political groupings on 
a long-term basis." At the same time, however, the marked 
increase in the number of acts of violence indicates that this 
tendency has "not simultaneously led to a decrease in moves 
endangering security." 
<H5>  Counterintelligence </H5>
  The FRG's political, economic, and technological importance 
is of continued interest to foreign intelligence services. 
According to the BfV report, 1,816 investigations into treason 
and the endangering of external security were instituted in 
1993. Arrest warrants were issued against 31 people; they had 
all been recruited by the former GDR intelligence service. 
  To perform its tasks, the FRG counterintelligence service 
also requires information on the structure and development of 
foreign intelligence services. The BfV focuses primarily on the 
Russian Federation and other Eastern European states. Following 
the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation had 
sought to base its civilian and military intelligence services 
and the Russian Security (MBR) on principles appropriate to a 
rule-of-law state. However, the Russian services are still to 
find their final form and could not make full use of their 
operational possibilities. In 1993, information gathering 
conducted by the Federation particularly concentrated on the 
economy, science, and technology and above all on the field of 
military strategy and technology. In addition, the Russian 
services sought to collect information on political parties, the 
strength of parties, and the development of extremism in Germany. 
  In 1993, the German counterintelligence service concentrated 
on secret service activities of the former GDR. It was possible 
to uncover almost the entire network of agents operated by the 
Foreign Intelligence Collection Main Administration (HVA) of the 
former Ministry of State Security (MfV). 
  In general, the federal ministry states in the BfV report 
that recently intelligence services have been operating more 
cautiously to avoid foreign complications as much as possible.

<F P=106> ["gb" report: "Bundesbank Lowers Money Market Rate"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 20 Apr -- On Wednesday [20 April] 
the German Bundesbank allocated to the business banks new 
financial means at an interest rate of 5.58 percent within the 
framework of its weekly money market business. Last week this 
interest rate had been 5.7 percent and the week before 5.73 
percent. The slightly faster decline of the so-called "third 
prime rate" was no surprise to most participants in the market, 
after the Bundesbank had reduced the two traditional interest 
rates, the discount rate and the Lombard rate, last Thursday [14 
April]. A few hours after the allocation by the Bundesbank, the 
Belgian National Bank announced a reduction of its money market 
rate from 5.8 to 5.7 percent.

  [Text] [Announcer] Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao 
Barroso has called on the international community not to abandon 
Mozambique in the current phase of the peace process. Durao 
Barroso met Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama earlier this afternoon. The former is concerned 
about the withdrawal of a number of countries from the UN 
contingent in Mozambique. It should be recalled that Italy 
recently withdrew half of its men. 
  [Begin recording] [Barroso] We must draw attention to what 
is 
happening in Mozambique, because unfortunately there are cases 
where it is only when things go wrong that people remember. 
Recently we have seen tragic cases in Africa. The case now of 
Rwanda is a tragic case -- tens of thousands of deaths. 
Therefore, we think it is better to try to prevent things 
rather than to act a posteriori. Indeed, a contribution to the 
formation of the armed forces, and not just the armed forces but 
also the demobilized men, a contribution to social 
reintegration, even emergency aid in some areas, would be a way 
of consolidating this process. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Durao Barroso also presented a list of support 
measures Portugal is taking to help the Mozambican electoral 
process. The cost of maintaining the 4th Army battalion alone 
is estimated at nearly 7 billion escudos. Afonso Dhlakama will 
take back to Renamo about 50 million escudos for the electoral 
campaign, from the Lisbon government.

Portugal's help in solidifying the Mozambican peace process. 
After meeting Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] leader, in Lisbon, the Portuguese foreign affairs

support for Renamo so it can become a political party. 
  In turn, Dhlakama insisted that, irrespective of the outcome

<F P=106> [Eduardo Mascarenhas report: "Military at Azimuth of </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] Fernando Nogueira believes that the changes taking 
place on the continent of Europe cause Portugal, in its capacity 
as a member of the Atlantic Alliance, the European Union, and 
its military component -- the WEU [Western European Union] -- 
henceforth to assume the role of a fulcral country as regards 
Europe's security and defense, while preserving transatlantic 
ties. 
  In other words, the defense minister believes that the time 
has come for Portugal to contribute more substantially to the 
strengthening of the Atlantic alliance's European pillar by 
systematically committing to the WEU's (still mediocre) military 
structure the operational product resulting from the process of 
modernizing its own Armed Forces. 
  This is the purport of a working communication that Fernando 
Nogueira has conveyed to the Armed Forces chief of staff and the 
director general of defense policy. In this communication, the 
defense minister orders the intensification of studies aimed at 
realizing the above-mentioned intention, but does not forget 
interests linked to the country's influence in Africa and in the 
regional geostrategic scenario of which it forms part. 
  The external aspect of the government's philosophy is based 
on the ideas approved by the last NATO summit, specifically 
those connected with Partnership for Peace and the Joint 
Combined Forces, which give the alliance a new image as a 
security organization; and the internal aspect is based on the 
new Strategic Concept of National Defense. 
  Portugal's appropriate and balanced presence in the 
above-mentioned international organizations (NATO and the WEU), 
as well as support for the initiatives aimed at maintaining 
global and regional stability carried out by the United Nations 
and the CSCE, does not impair but rather makes advisable an 
increased national prominence in bilateral and multilateral 
relations -- obviously within our real means -- whereby the 
safeguarding of national interests will be complemented in a 
sustained and harmonious manner, Minister Fernando Nogueira 
states in the communication concerned. 
<H5>  Observer in Eurocorps </H5>
  The defense minister directs that until a new form of joint 
military structure is created in the WEU and NATO, the national 
forces allocated to the Atlantic alliance should be deemed 
available for the WEU, and that the feasibility of various 
initiatives should be studied. 
  Three of these are the possible strengthening of the WEU's 
structures with Portuguese military personnel, the posting of an 
observer to the Eurocorps command, and the participation of the 
Separate Airborne Brigade (BAI) in the nonpermanent ground 
component of the Mediterranean Air and Sea Force. 
  At the same time, forms of participation by Portuguese naval 
air forces in that Mediterranean joint force will also be 
studied. 
  Within the strictly European framework, it will also rest 
with the military to propose the phasing of the Marine Corps' 
possible forms of participation in the Anglo-Dutch Amphibian 
Brigade. 
<H5>  NATO, United Nations, and Portuguese-Speaking African </H5>
Countries 
  The development of bilateral cooperation in the sphere of 
the 
defense of the Central and Eastern European region -- 
specifically with Romania and Hungary -- is also advocated by 
the defense minister, who, in light of the last NATO summit's 
conclusions, also ponders the ability to respond to Russia. 
  Active participation in the working parties developing in 
international forums the ideas of Partnership for Peace and 
Joint Combined Forces will be the background for carrying out 
that kind of cooperation. 
  The setting up of a group of national forces for possible 
allocation to the United Nations (on a standby basis) also 
appears in the defense minister's communication. 
  With respect to the national political and strategic 
framework, Fernando Nogueira refers to the intensification of 
bilateral defense relations with the Maghreb countries and 
technical and military cooperation (including at the trilateral 
level) with the Portuguese-speaking African countries and other 
countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

  [Text] The Martin Posadillo, a ship belonging to the 
Spanish Army, left last night with a shipment of armored trucks 
and radio equipment for the Cordoba Group deployed in Bosnia. 
Over to our studios in Valencia. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Last night, the Army cargo ship 
Martin Posadillo left the port of Valencia for former 
Yugoslavia. It is carrying a shipment of nearly 50 vehicles and 
radio equipment to reinforce the Cordoba Group in its mission. 
The Cordoba Group is the fourth battalion of the Spanish Army 
to participate in the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. 
  This information stems from the Captaincy General of the 
southeast coast military region. Armored personnel carriers, 
military engineering vehicles, four-wheel drive trucks, 
excavating machines, tows, cranes, and radio equipment make up 
the shipment. 
  This equipment is sent to reinforce what has been used until 
now by the three preceding groups in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The missions for which the new equipment will be used 
include 
removing rubble and repairing housing destroyed by shelling.

  [Excerpt] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana is on his 
way to Brazil, where he will take part in the meeting between 
the 12 members of the EU [European Union] and the countries 
belonging to the Rio Group, which consists of Mexico and the 10 
South American countries. From Barajas airport in Madrid, here 
is our correspondent Hector Arenas. 
  [Begin recording] [Arenas] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier 
Solana described the meeting in Rio de Janeiro as one of the 
most important between the EU and South American countries. 
This meeting is taking place after the approval and signing of 
the Uruguay Round. Foreign Minister Solana added that this 
meeting between Europeans and South Americans belonging to the 
Rio Group starts taking into account that last year the EU 
increased its investments in the American continent. They are 
now 33 percent, higher than the 30 percent made in the emerging 
Asian countries. 
  Furthermore Solana highlighted the importance Spain gives to 
its relations with South American countries, not only 
economically but also politically, in the state reforms and in 
the battle against poverty. 
  [Solana] It has to do with what we could call sustained 
development -- sustained development in the fight against 
poverty in the first place, and second, what we could call the 
measures for reforming the state, modernizing the state. We 
should remember that there is a cooperation far more important 
than the economic one -- especially for those countries with a 
growth of more than 3 percent; in other words, the countries of 
the Rio Group. Now there is an interest in cooperation, in 
helping with modernizing the state and its institutions. 
  [Arenas] Solana underlined his frustration from the recent 
Bosnian-Serb attacks on the population of Gorazde. After these 
attacks, Spain and the countries searching for a solution to the 
conflict in Bosnia have decided to act together on two main 
fronts: to answer the request by the UN secretary general to 
extend the Sarajevo model to other safe areas and to coordinate 
a diplomatic initiative. 
  And finally Solana announced that Spain was the first 
country 
to manage to get all of its citizens, mainly nuns and priests, 
out of Rwanda. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`I Am Absolutely Weary and Feel </F>
Doubly Cheated,' Deputy Prime Minister Says"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra has 
declared himself "weary" of the atmosphere of corruption which 
is besetting the country and which has been seriously 
undermining society's confidence in the state's institutions 
over the past few weeks. Asked about the strong social and 
political impact caused by the cases uncovered by the press 
concerning former Civil Guard Director Luis Roldan and former 
Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio, Serra was direct and 
emphatic: "I am absolutely weary of the topic, and I have been 
devoting hours to it for days, because we cannot carry on like 
this," he said. The deputy prime minister said that he feels 
deeply "disturbed" and "doubly cheated" in this connection, and 
reiterated several times the need "for it to be made clear to 
the country once and for all that impunity is over," in order to 
be able fully to restore confidence in the institutions. 
  Referring to the case of former Civil Guard Director Luis 
Roldan, Serra stated, without concealing his indignation: "It 
seems inconceivable to me that when you have rendered the 
country services or attended dramatic occasions such as I have 
experienced at funerals and so forth, you can reconcile that 
work for the community with certain personal actions, and since 
it seems inconceivable to me, I say so." 
  Narcis Serra went so far as to say that "if somebody has to 
go to prison, then he has to go to prison," and came out in 
favor of amending procedural law in order to shorten legal 
proceedings and rapidly clear up this kind of case which creates 
social alarm. In Serra's opinion, it is a matter not so much of 
damage to the credibility and image of the government or the 
ruling party as of grave harm to Spanish society's collective 
morale, about which he expressed open concern. Emphasizing that 
it is "an injury to the institutions, and hence to the country, 
which could be very difficult to cure," the deputy prime 
minister asked: "If neither our Civil Guard nor our Bank of 
Spain is immune to that kind of conduct, who is going to believe 
in the country?" 
  Serra emphasized that "this country needs more 
self-confidence because it is emerging from the crisis, albeit 
slowly, and the greatest factor which could help us is the 
country's self-confidence, and this is a torpedo at the 
waterline in this respect." 
  The deputy prime minister, who said that he was speaking in 
complete harmony -- "beyond all doubt" -- with Felipe Gonzalez' 
thinking and stance, concluded by asserting that the government 
is gathering all the information needed to clarify these two 
matters as soon as possible. Serra referred to the setting in 
motion of all the tax inspectorate's machinery and to the 
government attorney's office's activity initiated by the 
government for the complete clarification of the facts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CiU Satisfied With Its Support for </F>
Government"] 
  [Excerpt] Barcelona -- The Convergence and Union (CiU) 
coalition's liaison committee yesterday expressed its 
satisfaction with "the course of negotiations with the central 
government and the positive expectation" of new agreements on 
autonomy policy. 
  Among these expectations, CiU highlights the transfer of 
powers in agriculture and justice, public health funding, and 
the autonomous police law, Europa Press reports. 
  The liaison committee assessed as positive CiU's 
contributions in economic policy, especially in the negotiations 
on the reform of the labor market, "which are aimed essentially 
at assisting the necessary economic recovery, job creation, and 
confidence-building." 
  The committee also referred to the coming European 
elections, 
and commented on an opinion poll which places CiU as the winning 
political force in Catalonia, since the pol indicates that CiU 
will succeed in defeating the Socialists in nonautonomous 
community elections for the first time. 
  As CiU spokesmen Pere Esteve and Eugeni Perez-Moreno 
explained, the nationalists' macropoll indicates the prospect of 
a loss of votes for the Socialist Party of Catalonia and a 
continuation of the upward trend registered by the People's 
Party in the last legislative elections. 
  With respect to this poll, the liaison committee believes 
that it is quantitatively and qualitatively "favorable" for CiU, 
because it places the coalition as the winner of these 
elections, and because it represents "a very favorable 
assessment of the work performed by Chairman Pujol in Europe and 
of the policy upheld by CiU in the European Parliament, as well 
as of the policy conducted by the coalition in Catalonia and at 
the national level." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Bente Egjar Engesland "Background" article: "The Party Is </F>
in His Pocket --But Not the Policies"] 
  [Text] With dictatorial power Carl I. Hagen yesterday took 
apart the opposition in his party. Hagen owns the Progress 
Party [FrP], but the party is in the process of slipping away 
from him. Even if he held all the power in the national 
conference hall, his standing in Norwegian political life is 
less strong. Hagen's party only had 4.3 percent of voter 
support in the most recent AFTENPOSTEN/Opinion poll. 
  The purge of the liberalist-liberal wing is being described 
by delegates as a Stalinist trial. The forces of reaction have 
now devoured their own children. Now the rules are being 
followed, Hagen responds. The disloyalty of the "gang of four" 
in the Storting group will be taken as an active act of 
resignation from the party. 
  But will the Bolkesjo meeting also be the beginning of the 
end for Hagen himself? In his ruthless attack from the 
speaker's rostrum, he said that there is "deep disagreement" and 
"division" in the FrP. Indeed, so strong is the abhorrence he 
has become the target of among the minority that 44 delegates 
abstained in the chairmanship election -- even though Hagen was 
the only candidate. Hagen did not appear to the delegates in 
the Telemark mountains to be the solid rock, but more like a man 
who is desperately trying to hang on close to the edge. 
Bolkesjo was a political disaster area where more than just 
Hagen could need crisis counseling. Ellen Wibe and Ellen 
Christine Christensen emerged as pale as corpses after their 
boss had had his say. They had been rendered speechless. Women 
are out. 
  It is of course possible to ask whether the liberalists 
should not also look carefully at what course they should adopt 
and ask themselves whether voluntary "exit" from the party is 
actually logical. The liberalists say themselves that they back 
the party's program -- they do not represent a real and full 
political alternative. 
  Carl I. Hagen has used all the means at his disposal to 
fight 
to keep his position. It has become more important for Hagen to 
lead the party than to engage in politics. Hagen was also the 
only person on whom the majority at the conference was able to 
unite. Policies were as good as absent. Since the party 
chairman's initiative on taxation in the election campaign, not 
even the fight against taxation is a simple matter. 
  Nevertheless, the message from Bolkesjo is "to the right" 
and 
an appeal to the party's original voters. Only one issue 
succeeded in filling the conference with enthusiasm -- Hagen's 
passionate address directed against "Islamic fundamentalism." 
As psephologist Bernt Aardal has pointed out, it is well 
documented that FrP voters differ from other parties' voters on 
one point: immigration. There is a potential among the 
Norwegian people for anti-immigration views, but Aardal also 
takes the view that this is a dangerous policy area for the FrP 
to concentrate exclusively on. Hostility toward immigrants has 
its limit. When it tips over into pure, unadulterated racism 
decent Norwegians are repelled. 
  Aardal sees greater scope in Hagen's radicalization of the 
principle of a social policy that only embraces those who are 
genuinely in need. Hagen says that those who only have their 
own choices to thank for the state of their health should be 
treated differently from those who fall ill through no fault of 
their own. The "nicotine slaves" who were massively represented 
at Bolkesjo did not stub out their cigarettes just because of 
this. 
  And the remaining FrP members will steer clear of the EU 
[European Union] battle, the biggest political issue since 1972. 
  While Bolkesjo Hotel opened up a panorama of beautiful, 
proud, and snow-covered mountains, the FrP withdrew into the 
darkness and worshiped narrow-mindedness. 
  "A future with its roots in the past" was the title of the 
famous Hagen resolution that was pushed through by 94 votes 
against 54. The FrP is an up-and-down party and could pull 
itself up out of the ruins again. But the party has said 
good-bye to the near future.

<F P=106> [Article by Henrik Ennart including unattributed interview </F>
with Anders Eriksson, new head of SAPO, in Salen on 7 April: 
"New SAPO Chief Unknown From Justice: Strict Discretion 
Distinctive"] 
  [Text] In sun and snow, the Justice Ministry's head of the 
legal section, Anders Eriksson, 49, on Thursday [7 April] tried 
to absorb the fact that the government had decided to appoint 
him the new head of the security police. He spent the day 
cross-country skiing in Salen with his wife, Bodil, and daughter 
Louise, 17. But via a telephone connection from the Hogfjall 
Hotel, he told SVENSKA DAGBLADET that SAPO [Security Police] 
will continue its reorientation when he takes over on 1 May. 
<H5>  More Terrorism </H5>
  [Eriksson] My appointment will not affect anything. Because 
of the fall of the East bloc, the security police are moving 
away from military threat perceptions and devoting more energy 
to terrorism and serious crime. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Russian crime? 
  [Eriksson] All serious crime. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The United States has recently organized 
a group of environmental agents who are working under the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. Is this something for 
Sweden to copy? You were once secretary in the environmental 
damage fund commission. 
  [Eriksson] In the United States they have agents for just 
about everything, but environmental agents in Sweden are not 
necessary. The government has instead decided to add an 
environmental ombudsman. 
<H5>  Time To Find </H5>
  The government took its time finding a successor for former 
SAPO chief Mats Borjesson. When they finally decided, they 
picked a person who, in the manner of top legal professionals, 
disdains the public spotlight and always observes strict 
discretion. 
  Few know him outside the circles of power, despite the fact 
that he has held top positions at the Justice Ministry since he 
was hired as an adviser in 1980 and despite the fact that he has 
been an appeals court judge in the Gota Court of Appeals since 
1986. 
<H5>  No Comments </H5>
  He is keeping this low profile even after his appointment. 
To every question concerning SAPO's activities or his 
qualifications for appointment, the answer was "I cannot comment 
on that." 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But your background as a captain in the 
reserves in Skanska dragoon regiment P2 probably played a role? 
There you belong to the secret forces that have special tasks 
in the early stages of a war. 
  [Eriksson] As you surely understand, I cannot comment on 
that. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So it is your experience at the ministry 
that weighed most heavily in the appointment? 
  [Eriksson] I don't know. I have also taught at the police 
academy and have worked in the court system. You have already 
mentioned the military background. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] How much contact have you had with SAPO 
up until now? 
  [Eriksson] Some contact, but in my job at the Justice 
Ministry, I have not needed to know the entire picture. To 
begin with, I must familiarize myself with this. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So you will now go through the files in 
SAPO's archives? 
  [Eriksson] Maybe I won't quite go about it in that manner.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today 
stressed that if the efforts to reach an agreement have failed 
by the end of next week, then everyone who is interested in the 
Cyprus issue must conclude that the Turkish side has no 
political desire for a solution on either the 
confidence-building measures or the substance of the Cyprus 
issue. The spokesman concluded: Therefore, the way the issues 
are handled following this evaluation will have consequences 
that might even extend the status quo. 
  Kasoulidhis stressed that the government will not let the 
issue dominate efforts to solve the Cyprus problem. He said: 
One year is more than enough. 
  Answering questions, the spokesman reiterated that the Greek 
Cypriot side insists on the 21 March UN document on the 
confidence-building measures.. He added that yesterday's 
meeting between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel, 
the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in 
Cyprus, does not fall within the framework of proximity talks 
but is part of customary meetings.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has stated that the Turkish 
Cypriot side is in favor of the continuation of the negotiations 
and added: Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriot side is constantly 
accused of proposing new ideas. Denktas indicated that the 
issue would have been solved a long time ago if the essentials 
submitted by the Turkish side in the letters of 20 and 28 
January had not been changed. 
  Denktas met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
assistant special representative in Cyprus, once more today. 
Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; Ahmet 
Atay Rasit, foreign affairs minister and defense minister; 
Ministerial Under Secretary Ozer Koray; and presidential 
advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun participated in 
the meetings. During the meeting Gustave Feissel was 
accompanied by John Paul Cavanaugh. 
  In statements he issued prior to and after the meetings, 
Denktas said that the difficulties encountered in the 
negotiations stem from the changes that were made in the 
confidence-building measures and that the Turkish side, who 
wants these changes to be rectified, is being accused of 
constantly proposing new ideas. Explaining that the issues that 
need to be changed -- Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia] 
International Airport -- are vital issues for the Turkish side, 
Denktas said that it is unacceptable that a first-degree 
military area like Maras should be demilitarized. Denktas said: 
We want satisfaction regarding equality and coexistence. 
Denktas said that the compromises to the Turkish side should not 
be in word but in action. 
  Answering reporters' questions after the meeting, Feissel 
said that they had discussed the recent week's developments with 
Denktas and that they would meet once again on Wednesday. 
Feissel said that, together with special representative Joe 
Clark, he would hold contacts in Athens and Ankara and that they 
would return to Cyprus next week. 
  In answer to a question, Feissel reiterated the view that an 
agreement may be reached by the end of April, but that positive 
answers both from Kliridhis and Denktas were needed to achieve 
this.

<F P=106> [Report by Basaran Duzgun: "Confusion Over Varosha"] </F>
  [Text] Total confusion has developed during the ongoing 
indirect talks between the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
[TRNC], the Greek Cypriot side, and the United Nations over the 
fenced area of Varosha whose transfer to the United Nations for 
Greek Cypriot settlement is envisaged within the framework of 
confidence building measures. 
  The sides understand different things by the term "Maras" 
[Varosha]. 
  This is how the sides define Varosha: 
  TRNC: The fenced area of Varosha is the area whose north and 
west is fenced, and which extends to the sea on the east and to 
the Golden Sands Hotel in the south. 
  The Greek Cypriot side and the United Nations: The fenced 
area of Varosha is the area whose north and west is fenced, and 
which extends to the sea on the east, and to "Varosha's 
administrative boundary" on the south. 
  There is a nearly 1.5 square km difference between these two 
definitions. In the Greek Cypriot and UN definition, the 
"fenced area of Varosha extends 1.5 km south of the Golden Sands 
Hotel." Some hotels and many unfinished buildings are located 
in this area. 
<H5>  The Sides Are Insistent on Their Positions </H5>
  In defining the fenced area of Varosha, the TRNC used the 
present definition from the very start, whereas the United 
Nations indicates that from the "very start" it understood it to 
be the area defined by the United Nations today, and it draws 
attention to the fact that the area in question is also fenced 
on the south. 
  In addition, the Greek Cypriots and the United Nations want 
the region between the southern part of the Varosha area -- as 
they define it -- and the borders (Green Line) [preceding two 
words in English] to be unmanned. In which case, this region 
will be transformed into some kind of a "buffer region" and the 
TRNC armed forces will be forced to withdraw from the southern 
border of this region. According to the Greek Cypriots and 
United Nations, this is the only way to ensure reliable 
communications for the Greek Cypriots between southern Cyprus 
and Varosha. 
  On the other hand, the TRNC is opposing the seizure of 
additional lands from the TRNC by putting forward new concepts, 
and is stressing that this is unacceptable. 
<H5>  What Installations Are Found in the Region? </H5>
  According to the new map prepared by the United Nations, in 
addition to the 105 hotels and hotel-apartments inside the 
fenced area of Varosha, there are eight hotel-apartments and 
many residential buildings and shops in the new region coveted 
from the Turkish side. This region, which is the continuation 
of John Kennedy Avenue and passes in front of the 1000-bed 
Golden Sands Hotel on the southern border of the fenced-in 
Varosha area, is a 1.5 sq km coastal strip. The residential 
buildings in the region end with the house known as the 
Painter's House, after which John Kennedy Avenue continues as a 
dirt road until it reaches the Green Line 1 km away. 
<H5>  Report on Leasing Was Not Confirmed </H5>
  In the meantime, the reports in the Turkish press, which 
were 
also quoted by some local papers and magazines, to the effect 
that "the United States wants to lease a place in Varosha," have 
not been confirmed. 
  A high-ranking official told our newspaper that no such 
proposal had been submitted to the TRNC by the American 
officials dealing with the Cyprus problem. 
  This high-ranking official said: "No such issue was raised 
during the talks held in Nicosia last week. The Americans did 
not make such a proposal to us. Just like you, we too read that 
in the Turkish press. We are investigating it."

  [Text] Greek Cypriots have started operations to forcibly 
evict the Turkish Cypriots living in south Cyprus. Nineteen 
Turkish Cypriots who had illegally passed from the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus to south Cyprus received inhuman 
treatment and were evicted. Some of the evicted have been 
living in south Cyprus for a long time. 
  Greek Cypriots evicting a group of Turkish Cypriots by 
beating them, at a time when the Greek Cypriot authorities are 
talking about peace and friendship, proves once more that the 
two people cannot coexist. The fact that the Greek Cypriot 
authorities, who have shown their true face to world, increased 
their pressure on the Turkish Cypriot minority living in the 
south Cyprus at a time when the confidence-building measures are 
being negotiated, exacerbates feelings of distrust between the 
two populations. Even Yilmaz Mavideniz, among the evicted 
Turkish Cypriots, who was in close cooperation with the Greek 
Cypriot police was not spared eviction.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Athens--ellipses as published] </F>
  [Excerpts] Crete will play an important role in the 
rearrangement of the armed forces of Greece and Cyprus. 
  Consequently, Crete is the focus of studies and plans by the 
Greek National Defense General Staff and the National Guard 
General Staff regarding the doctrine of a unified defense space 
of the two countries. 
  Revelations by President Glavkos Kliridhis to an expatriate 
gathering in London concerning the unified defense area have 
raised questions in foreign military circles. 
  I MAKHI today reveals the implementation of Cyprus' "Defense 
Shield" (that is, what is allowed...to be revealed), as well as 
a statement by a high-ranking military source regarding the role 
of the Greek and Cypriot armed forces in the unified defense 
area. 
  The decision by the Athens and Nicosia Governments that 
includes Cyprus in Greece's unified defense area is to begin 
implementation as soon as possible and to the extent dictated by 
Cyprus' special defense needs. 
  As military circles in the [Greek] Pentagon revealed to I 
MAKHI, the decisions made during President Kliridhis' visit to 
Athens and during Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos 
Arsenis' visit to Nicosia are promoted methodically and quickly. 
[passage omitted] 
  Characteristically, a top-ranking military source told I 
MAKHI: "Effectively, a defense umbrella will cover Cyprus. The 
success of the defense doctrine will be based on unified 
Hellenism, something that means--and it is very clear to the 
Greek National Defense Ministry--that an offensive action by the 
Turks provides the legal base for our country (Greece) to attack 
Turkey from any point, not just from the front that Turkey will 
open...." 
  Greece will assume Cyprus' air cover by making the most 
modern equipment available to the Greek Air Force. Crete, which 
is at the center of the new defense doctrine's plans, will play 
a significant role in the air coverage. 
  Crete is considered very important for Cyprus (its air 
cover), because of its position but mainly because Cyprus is 
impregnable and can defend itself against any offensive action 
against it. 
  Greece will cover Cyprus' sea areas with the most modern 
naval ships. 
  Cyprus is determined to contribute decisively to the 
implementation of the plan for a common defense space with 
Greece. More important is that "the Cypriot Government made the 
commitment to participate financially in the armament program." 
  Cyprus will prepare refueling bases for the Greek military 
planes as well as a naval base at a specific area that has been 
chosen and is considered ideal for this purpose. [passage 
omitted] 
  These "war preparations" are not offensive. They are 
defensive and this has been made clear in every direction, 
especially to NATO, which is concerned.... 
  In this way, the fronts the Turkish expansionist army must 
face will increase. 
  The possibilities of a Turkish offensive decrease and at the 
same time Turkey is under pressure to revise its intransigence 
on both the Aegean and Cyprus. 
  The goal of every study and plan regarding the unified 
defense space is to establish Hellenism firmly and increase the 
negotiating capability of Greece and Cyprus.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "The Time for Other Options"] </F>
  [Text] Rauf Denktas' rejection of the proposals by the U.S. 
coordinator for Cyprus, who has paid a lightning visit to 
Cyprus, must have given a political shock to the White House. 
It is not by accident that the new defiance by the Turkish 
Cypriot leader came while Tugay Ulucevik, a leading member of 
the Turkish Government, was visiting the occupied areas. It is 
also obvious that while Tansu Ciller might pretend to President 
Bill Clinton that... [ellipsis as published] "she is doing all 
she can," Denktas does not give in. This is an old trick, since 
it is well known that the pseudostate is being maintained by the 
Turkish military presence in the occupied part of Cyprus. 
  This fact alone shows that if it wanted to, Ankara could 
pull 
the rug out from under Denktas' feet and lead him by the ear. 
However, since nothing like this is being done because the same 
old double talk continues and the occupation is perpetuated, 
President Glavkos Kliridhis' proposal for demilitarization, 
which implies the withdrawal of the occupation troops, has 
particular significance. 
  We expect that the United States, which has openly said it 
favors the invasion army's withdrawal, will want to adopt and 
promote President Kliridhis' suggestion instead of trying to 
resurrect a process that has been killed by Turkish 
intransigence. Besides, the occupation of Famagusta, on which 
most of the disagreements on the confidence-building measures 
are focused, is due to Turkey itself. 
  Consequently, the alternative measures that should ensue 
after Denktas' defiance must include the UN Security Council's 
order for the withdrawal of the Attila hordes. 
  We expect that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's 
forthcoming contacts with President Clinton will focus on these 
alternative measures, in full alignment and harmony with the 
Cypriot leadership and the whole spectrum of the Greek 
leadership. 
  The primary goal of our political strategy must be the one 
which President Kliridhis declared before the opening of the 
talks on the confidence-building measures. That is, it must 
become evident through specific actions that the Cyprus solution 
does not depend on Turkey's desire but on the Security Council's 
will. 
  This goal has become more feasible as a result of the 
Turkish 
intransigence and filibustering tactics, which underline this 
historic necessity. 
  Every evil has its good aspect. Denktas' provocation through 
his defiance dictates that it be confronted practically in the 
way we mentioned earlier. President Kliridhis has a strong lead 
on this issue and he is also indicating to the world powers the 
course that is necessary. 
  It is inconceivable for this unproductive waiting to 
continue 
considering that the Security Council has ruled that the current 
status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable and must end. Now is the 
time for words to become deeds and for the state declarations to 
become specific actions.

  [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly [TGNA], has said that those who have the power 
to stop the massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina but do not do so are 
as responsible as those who actually perpetrate the massacre. 
  Cindoruk received Zarko Domljan, chairman of the Croatian 
Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, and his delegation today. 
Cindoruk stressed at the meeting that the Serbs will not escape 
their destiny as the unjust party in history and in the eyes of 
the world. A massacre of this nature in the middle of Europe 
during a civilized age in history is unacceptable, he said, 
adding that murdering defenseless people is also a bad example 
for other parts of the world. The TGNA speaker asked: On the 
eve of the 21st century, is Europe returning to its feudal 
structure of the Middle Ages? 
  Cindoruk stressed that the United Nations and NATO failed to 
display the required determination in the face of Serbian 
aggression. Unless the attacks are stopped, he said, the 
effectiveness of these organizations will be in doubt. 
  The TGNA speaker also said that the Serbian attacks violate 
the Paris Charter and the Human Rights Declaration and strip 
them of their importance. He added that the agreement between 
the Croats and the Bosnians constitutes an important step toward 
the solution of the problem by peaceful means. 
  In turn, Domljan said that the Croats have always maintained 
that Bosnia-Herzegovina should have its independence and 
territorial integrity. We are opposed to the forcible change of 
borders or to the occupation of territory, he said. 
  Before meeting with Cindoruk, the Croatian parliamentary 
delegation visited Erdal Inonu, chairman of the TGNA Foreign 
Relations Committee, and Baki Tug, chairman of the TGNA National 
Defense Committee.

<F P=106> [Article by Hayri Birler: "He Who Sows the Seeds..."] </F>
  [Text] As the impact of the Welfare Party (RP) victory in 
the local elections shake the country, Sunday's protest rallies 
that turned into violent shows of strength for anti-secularist 
views, served as an eye opener for the country's leaders, 
showing them the strong presence of fundamentalist forces. 
  Even Tansu Ciller, who conducted an election campaign based 
partly on God, the Koran and prayer, has forgotten what she said 
in her campaign and has lately declared: "These rallies are 
against the regime. I demand a detailed survey of all 
anti-secularist activities." 
  Of course, pro-Islamic factions have not reached such a 
point 
that they actually threaten the regime in Turkey--a country that 
is 99 percent Muslims and, at the same time, has adopted 
secularism as one of its main principles. These factions simply 
wanted to demonstrate their strength by driving people out into 
the streets. 
  I must stress that those who helped pro-Islamic forces gain 
strength are--whatever their intentions and whenever they came 
to power--those who have ruled the country during the last 14 
years, namely: the military coup leadership of Kenan Evren; and 
the Motherland Party's (ANAP) Turgut Ozal. 
  Before the Sept. 12, 1980 military coup, Turkey experienced 
a 
period of coalition governments which included the participation 
of the National Salvation Party (MSP), the precursor of the RP. 
Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the RP, became deputy prime 
minister on three occasions in various coalition governments and 
assisted in forming the coalition protocols, sometimes even by 
issuing threats. 
  But, at that time, none of those protocols included promises 
to make religious classes compulsory in the schools. It may 
come as a surprise, but it is nonetheless true: It was the 
Turkish military, known as the guardian of secularism, that 
placed religion as a compulsory component of education in 
primary schools, secondary schools, and gymnasiums. And this 
was done, not through an amendment of any law, but as a 
necessary part of the constitution! 
  Coup leader and President Kenan Evren, while ordering the 
arrest of MSP leaders, was keen on telling the crowds on various 
occasions that his father was a member of the clergy. He 
stressed repeatedly how important religion was. 
  While explaining the implementation of new laws, he often 
cited verses in the Koran for confirmation. 
  In order to play down the divisions in the country of the 
"left" and of the "right," Evren emphasized the unifying force 
of religion. This was done especially in the southeastern 
provinces where flyers covered with versus from the Koran were 
tossed out of airplanes. 
  Whatever its aims were, the military leadership of that 
period was actually sowing the first seeds of pro-Islamic 
enthusiasm that seems to have swept the country today. 
  ANAP (Motherland Party), which followed the military 
government, gathered a variety of parties under its wing, 
including the pro-Islamic forces, and proceeded to appoint 
especially "conservative" people as ministers of education and 
internal affairs. 
  One of Turgut Ozal's first actions as president was to 
attend 
Friday prayer in his official vehicle. 
  Those who defended the idea of a "Second Republic," with the 
support of Ozal, demanded that secularist paragraphs be taken 
out of the Constitution. 
  In a period when fundamentalists demonstrated against the 
principles of the republic, defenders of a "Second Republic" 
presented secularism as "the model of the 1930's" and criticized 
it. 
  Not long ago, during the funeral of Ozal, a mob threw stones 
at the military band shouting, "We do not want Christian 
marches!" and rallied in the streets chanting religious slogans. 
This was tolerated by the leaders of the country. 
  Concerning the level of pro-Islamic staff at the Ministries 
of Interior and Education, the General Police Directorate's 
Intelligence Unit reported the following in a secret report: "An 
illegal body with the aim of incorporating fundamentalism into 
society was formed at the Directorate. This body is especially 
active in the units concerned with police education." 
  There were also demands expressed that Friday replace Sunday 
as the state's official holiday and that shifts be organized so 
that civil servants can attend Friday prayers. 
  Remarkably, many of those who graduated from theological 
gymnasiums applied to university faculties that provide 
personnel for the public sector. 
  About one-fourth of the students at Ankara University's 
school of political science, which provides cities and towns 
with governors, were originally from theological gymnasiums. A 
week ago banners celebrating "police week," calling police the 
"guardians of the state," did not include the words "secular 
state." 
  Mehmet Agar, appointed by the government as head of police, 
said, "I do not see any point in bringing up the subject of 
secularism. This can lead to divisions in the society." And the 
police, under the leadership of Agar, did nothing to interfere 
with demonstrators who, last Sunday, waved pro-Islamic flags and 
attacked public buildings and foreign missions. That was the 
same police department that sat and watched as 37 people burned 
alive in Sivas, doing nothing to stop the violence. 
  Pro-Islamic forces are denying the principle of national 
sovereignty by claiming that "sovereignty belongs only to God." 
They are also denying the principles of a secularist democracy 
by saying that "the Constitution is the Holy Koran." These 
forces gained strength in the period covering the last 14 years, 
as described above. The seeds were sown and now they have begun 
to bear fruit. 
  As long as the liberal and social democratic movements lack 
the ability to devise solutions to national problems and as long 
as the traditional right and left face political bankruptcy, it 
is obvious that pro-Islamic forces will continue to gain 
momentum. 
  What the leaders of the country need to do is make a 
realistic assessment of the anti-secularist movements, save the 
state sector from the increasing threat of fundamentalist 
tendencies and produce political solutions as well. 
  Otherwise, Turkey will inevitably resemble Algiers in the 
not-too-distant future.

  [Text] Ankara, April 20 (A.A.) -- A law which regulates 
media broadcasts and publications came into force today when it 
was published in the Official Gazette. 
  The law foresees the establishment of a radio and television 
high board to control and oversee the media. The multi partisan 
board will be composed of nine members: five from the ruling 
party and four from opposition parties and will be nominated by 
parliament. The board will function for six years and three of 
its members will be replaced every two years. 
  The board will delegate national and regional frequencies, 
will issue broadcast licenses, will allocate channels and will 
monitor the compliance of radio and tv broadcasts to 
international agreements. 
  The board will be responsible for making sure that the 
broadcasts are in compliance with the expression of thought, the 
existence, independence and unity of the Turkish State, 
pluralism in communication and broadcasting, national and 
ethical values, and the basic concepts and principles of the 
republic as stated in the Constitution. 
  The amount of advertisement will not exceed 15 percent of 
daily broadcasting time. 
  The broadcasts will not be subjected to a ban or censorship 
by the board, unless by court verdicts. However, the prime 
minister or a minister charged by the prime minister will be 
authorized to interrupt a broadcast when national security 
issues clearly necessitate it or there is a very high likelihood 
that the public order could be damaged. 
  Radio and TV stations will be responsible for broadcasting 
announcements made by the president or the government on 
national security, public order, general health and general 
ethics.

  [Text] Ankara--At a news conference held yesterday to 
discuss terrorism and the economy, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
expounded the causes of various problems and ways of resolving 
them in what she described as "blunt terms." 
  Stating that no stability shock package will be introduced 
after the local elections and that the equilibration measures 
will continue, the prime minister discussed state economic 
enterprises [SEE], privatization, social security institutions, 
the budget deficit, devaluation, foreign trade and the country's 
balance of payments in the segment of her talk allocated to the 
economy. Ciller said: "If we had not enacted the tax law, the 
inflation rate would be 500 percent in the year 2000." She also 
said: "It was not us but the market that brought about the 
devaluation. We simply made it official." Stating that the rise 
in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the 
Treasury, Ciller said that "the Treasury has not borrowed for 
the last three months." 
  Ciller also insisted that there will be no early elections 
even if the electoral share of the coalition government drops in 
the local elections. Below are Ciller's comments on the economy 
under principle headings. 
<H5>  Causes of Devaluation </H5>
  The underlying cause of the problems that are being 
experienced today is the budget deficits that assumed high 
proportions in recent years. The swelling in public spending 
between 1984 and 1987 was increasingly financed through domestic 
and foreign borrowing. That kept inflation from accelerating but 
led to very high interest rates on domestic borrowing, which 
made interest payments the largest determinant of the public 
sector deficit beginning in 1988. In addition, the rise in real 
wages between 1989 and 1990 boosted the public sector deficit. 
The public sector borrowing requirement rose from 6.2 percent of 
the GNP in 1988 to 16.3 percent in 1993. When international 
capital movements were freed in 1989, increasingly larger 
volumes of short-term capital began flowing in from abroad. The 
financing of the public deficit with this mechanism resulted in 
slower price increases and a temporary acceleration in the 
growth rate. 
  On the other hand, the inflow of short-term capital boosted 
the relative value of the Turkish currency which led to a 
decline in exports and an increase in imports and upset the 
balance of trade and the current account. The increase in the 
public sector borrowing requirement made the control of the 
money supply difficult and boosted the demand for foreign 
currency. It also caused an increase in the exchange rates on 
the free market leading to a 20 percent exchange rate 
differential on 19 January. 
  Finally, the Central Bank adjusted the value of the Turkish 
lira vis-a-vis foreign currencies by 12 percent on 27 January 
1994 to eliminate uncertainty in the market, to prevent the 
rapid rise in the exchange rate, and to control excessive 
liquidity. 
<H5>  People Were Not Hurt </H5>
  This adjustment has helped to boost exports and to cut the 
foreign trade deficit and will protect the economy from 
speculative movements. The functional restoration of monetary 
policy is expected to have a positive medium-term effect on 
foreign trade, the growth rate, and prices. 
<H5>  Foreign Trade, Balance of Payments </H5>
  The ratio of exports to imports has declined steadily since 
1989, and the trade deficit has grown. This was caused by the 
rise in the relative value of the Turkish lira beginning in 
1989, the simultaneous liberalization of the import regime and 
capital movements, contractions in foreign markets, and the 
decline in tourism receipts as a result of the anarchic 
incidents experienced in 1993. We will reverse this course in a 
positive direction by ensuring exchange rate stability and 
confidence in exports, phasing in Exim Bank credits, maximizing 
the utilization of this resource and primarily using it as a 
source of predelivery import credits, and introducing other 
incentives for secondary and marginal export products. 
<H5>  Impact of Rising Real Wages </H5>
  The public sector wage index declined from a baseline of 100 
in 1980 to 49 in 1988. The private sector wage index dropped 
from a baseline of 100 to 87 during the same interval. The 
average wage in 1989 was 97 percent of its value in 1980. The 
decline in real wages and salaries between 1980 and 1988 was 
reversed steadily beginning in 1989, and wages increased rapidly 
in subsequent years. 
  This rapid rise in wages and salaries boosted the share of 
personnel expenditures in total public spending and had an 
adverse impact on the balance of public sector spending. This 
increase, which was not proportional to the growth in 
productivity, created compatibility problems in the private 
sector and limited employment because of the preference of 
entrepreneurs for capital-intensive production. 
  The rise in real wages and salaries combined with the 
increase in the relative value of the Turkish lira between 1989 
and 1990 cut the competitiveness of export products, and exports 
stalled. In this case the problem was not the high level of 
wages but their excessive fluctuation between 1980 and 1993. 
<H5>  New Tax Measures </H5>
  We introduced new tax legislation because our revenues could 
not keep up with our expenditures, because the system was not 
just, and because existing legislation was very complex. As a 
result of these measures the budget began to be financed with 
solid resources. Also fairness was ensured by low taxes on 
low-income individuals and high taxes on high-income 
individuals. In addition, taxation was simplified. 
<H5>  Had Tax Law Not Been Enacted </H5>
  Had we not enacted the tax law, the inflation rate would 
rise 
to 78 percent in 1994, 95 percent in 1995, 137 percent in 1996, 
and over 500 percent in 2001. That would result in a contraction 
of the economy: The GNP in 2001 would be 15 percent less than 
what it was in 1993. Per capita income would decline from $2,737 
in 1993 to 15 percent less in 2001. The public sector deficit 
would rise to 20 percent of the GNP in 2001. 
<H5>  SEE Burden on Economy </H5>
  The SEE's lost around 60 trillion lira in 1993. The SEE's 
became bankrupt because of excessively large payrolls, large 
wage increases, inadequate technology, and revenue losses as a 
result of the reduction of import barriers and the real increase 
in the value of the Turkish lira against foreign currencies. To 
stop that, privatization measures will be speeded up. SEE's 
which cannot be privatized or are found to be so will be 
restructured on the basis of effectiveness and productivity. 
Those laid off from work will not be allowed to suffer. The 
system of unemployment insurance will be expanded, and more 
employment will be created as a result of privatization. The 
battle against inflation will continue. 
<H5>  Social Security </H5>
  The deficits of the Social Security Organization and Bag-Kur 
[Social Security Association for Tradesmen, Artisans and the 
Self-Employed] in 1993 were 25 trillion and 6 trillion Turkish 
lira respectively. We introduced legislation to boost the 
premiums and other revenues of the Social Security Organization. 
We also decided to withhold 1 percent of earnings from 
agricultural products for Bag-Kur. 
<H5>  Agricultural Cooperatives </H5>
  Agricultural cooperatives are in a morass of debt. Their 
debt 
totals approximately 30 trillion Turkish lira. 
  Municipalities had a deficit of 2.304 trillion Turkish lira 
in 1991. Their total deficit is 6 trillion Turkish lira. We will 
reverse this adverse situation in the municipalities through 
reforms we will introduce in local governments.

<F P=106> [From the "Foreign Policy" column by Mustafa Necati </F>
Ozfatura: "To Defend Anatolia, First the Danube and the Sava 
Must Be Protected"] 
  [Excerpt] The defense of Anatolia and particularly of the 
straits in northeastern Turkey depends on the defense of the 
Danube and of the Sava and Drau Rivers. Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Kosovo, Sandzak, Western Thrace, and Albania are our outposts in 
the West. We must, in fact, it is our fate, to extend every 
possible kind of material and moral support to the more than 10 
million Muslims living in the Balkans. 
  Like the Balkans, Baku, Nagorno-Karabakh, Nakhichevan, 
Abkhazia and the countries in northern Caucasus, the Adzhar 
Republic, Crimea, Karkuk (Iraqi Turkmens), and Cyprus are 
Turkey's outposts and areas of interest. Anatolia can be 
defended only if these forts remain in the hands of the Muslims. 
  In fact, Anatolia is the real target of the games and 
scenarios being played in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Crimea, 
Cyprus, and northern Iraq. Throughout history, whenever 
Anatolia was united and strong, the Islamic world had peace and 
security. Whenever Anatolia was weakened and its unity 
disrupted, not only was the entire Islamic world exploited by 
imperialist forces, but it was also subjected to great suffering 
as a result of massacres, genocide, and other cruelties. 
  Anatolia is the center of the Turkish and Islamic world. 
Serbian martial music includes the slogan "Od Jadrana do Irana 
nece biti Muslumana," meaning all the Muslims from the Adriatic 
to Iran will be killed. This is not only the permanent wish of 
the Serbs but of the West; it is the hatred of the Crusaders. 
There is surely a reason behind the fact that the cultural 
heritage of the Turkish-Islamic civilization is being rudely 
destroyed while Christian works in Anatolia are being repaired. 
  The "holy alliance" the West established in Vienna was the 
first stage of the plan to expel the Turks from the Balkans. 
The last stage is to expel them from Anatolia. 
  Supporting the Balkans, the Caucasus, northern Iraq, Cyprus, 
Crimea, and the others is necessary to protect Turkey's 
existence today and in the future. It is certainly not a favor.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Altan Oymen: "Bloodstained Remarks"-- </F>
punctuation as published] 
  [Text] The "bloodstained" remarks made by Prosperity Party 
leader Necmettin Erbakan in his address to his party's 
parliamentary group meeting have had a "chilling effect" even on 
those who sympathize with that political party. He was expected 
to adopt a different approach after the demonstrations in Ankara 
and Istanbul on Sunday [10 April]. Many people believed that 
Erbakan would warn those who gathered under the Prosperity 
Party's banner and created incidents. They believed so because 
Erbakan supported "peace and brotherhood" in the statements he 
made during his election campaign. A move by him to warn the 
supporters of the Prosperity Party who prefer to call for war 
and engage in hostile activities instead of upholding the 
concept of peace and brotherhood and the militants who acted on 
behalf of the Prosperity Party would be in line with the 
principles Erbakan defended. But he did exactly the opposite. 
He supported the militants by saying that they are "members of 
our population." He described their "terrorist activities" 
against the state-owned buildings, political parties, and 
international establishments as an "uprising." He also 
described the administration in Turkey as a "terrorist" and 
"servile" entity that serves as a "colonialist subcontractor." 
  What was more confusing was his statement on "bloodshed." 
According to Erbakan, an unchanging fact is as follows: The 
Prosperity Party will come to power. The problem is whether the 
transition period will be "nice and smooth or bloody." The 
people will make the decision. 
  Who are the people who will make that decision? Will it be 
the aggressive individuals who were described by Erbakan as 
"within the ranks of his people"? 
  Obviously, over 90 percent of our people, including most of 
those who voted for the Prosperity Party in the local elections, 
have been disgusted by the aggressive activities. Would anyone 
other than aggressive individuals support the idea of a "bloody" 
change of administration? Who else would prefer a state of 
"bloodshed," which Necmettin Erbakan described as "one of the 
two options" in Turkey? The speech Erbakan gave two days ago 
should be read often. No other meaning can be given to it. If 
the Prosperity Party cannot come to power in a nice, smooth 
manner, that is, in a democratic way, it will do so through 
"bloodshed," that is, through an "uprising" similar to that 
which took place on Sunday.... It will definitely come to power 
one way or the other.... 
  Considering the meaning of Erbakan's speech, President 
Suleyman Demirel and all the other political party leaders moved 
to act yesterday. They were justified in doing so. They warned 
him in a way that he could and should understand them. 
  Erbakan claimed after he met the speaker of the Turkish 
Grand 
National Assembly that his remarks were distorted. Obviously, 
he reverted to the position he held prior to the local 
elections. He said: "We support peace and tranquillity." 
  The broadcasting of his speech two days ago by the 
television 
networks has confirmed that his remarks have not been distorted. 
His revelation yesterday was probably prompted by the reaction 
to his remarks, which has made him realize that he did something 
wrong. Of course, trying to correct a mistake is a positive 
approach. But which of the two revelations Erbakan made is 
true? Which of them reflects his true intention? It is 
becoming harder to establish that.

<F P=106> [From the "Today" column by Altan Oymen: "If It Continues </F>
Like This"] 
  [Text] What will happen if the situation continues as it 
is? What will happen if the organizers and participants in 
Sunday's incidents repeat their actions on other occasions?. 
  What will happen if they say that they will be holding 
rallies today for Bosnia, tomorrow for Azerbaijan, the next day 
for Western Thrace, and the day after that for Cyprus and they 
use the same methods? In other words: What will happen is they 
exploit the justified sensitivity of our people toward all those 
national causes to advance their own "cause"? What if they 
initiate a "jihad" under the green banner against the secular 
system of the state and our citizens who are loyal to that 
system? What if they stone official and party buildings and 
attack foreign embassies? 
  And what is more dangerous than that: What if the 
administrators of the legal political parties do not condemn the 
action of these supporters, but on the contrary, issue 
statements encouraging them? 
  To what will this lead? 
  Everyone should seriously consider the reply to this 
question. 
  Above all, Prosperity Party [PP] administrators should, 
among 
themselves, consider the following: 
  It is true that they have been most successful in the 27 
March elections and they have increased their votes from 10-11 
percent to 19 percent. Is this, however, what the new recruits 
expect from the party? Did they cast their votes so that our 
metropolitan areas could be turned into fighting arenas? 
  And the PP members? Is this what they promised the citizens 
when they asked for their votes prior to 27 March? Did they not 
say "We will bring peace and brotherhood to our people"? 
  Were they not sincere while they were making those promises? 
Were they acting as "wolves in sheep's clothing" in order "to 
get the votes and to do what they please afterwards"? 
  PP administrators should diagnose their situation from this 
angle. 
  If, in an atmosphere of victory in the aftermath of the 
recent elections, they believe that their promises are no longer 
binding... If they seem like "wolves" who no longer need "the 
sheep's clothing"... If they are saying: "We have accomplished 
what we wanted. The administration of most of the metropolitan 
areas is in our hands. The time has come now to occupy the 
streets." 
  To what will this lead? 
  One cannot know the details of what will happen. In general, 
however, the following is clear: It will not be beneficial for 
anyone. 
  We believe that whatever is "clear" to us is also clear to 
the Prosperity administrators. If so, they should make it 
"clear" that their preelection promises are binding. They 
should categorically issue a warning to their supporters who are 
willing to wage a "jihad" against the democratic and secular 
republic and 90 percent of its people. Those who do not heed 
this warning should be kept away from the party and the 
administrators should be the first ones to wage a struggle 
against them. 
  We hope that they will be exercising this "foresight."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Themos Kh. Stoforopoulos: "Justified Fears"] </F>
  [Text] The Greek prime minister's visit to the United 
States causes concern, because it has become obvious that the 
U.S. policy in our region not only does not take Greek interests 
into account but is opposed to them and is trying to "organize" 
the Balkans and the Near East against Hellenism, with Turkey as 
its axis. No one can believe that the only superpower cannot 
influence Ankara, Tirana, or Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] to support legality and peace. 
  With our behavior, which has turned us into a mere object to 
be maneuvered by the United States and the other Western powers, 
we have contributed to the formulation of the U.S. policy. We 
have not really utilized any of our advantages and have let our 
defense and economy reach a state where our dependency has 
become complete. 
  Our fears are being reinforced, because in all of the years 
that he has been responsible for our foreign policy, Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou has yielded to U.S. suggestions on 
substantive issues and tried to hide this behind a rhetorical 
screen. 
  Before it assumed the leadership, we remember that PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] was opposed to the 
intercommunal talks in Cyprus but afterward willingly conveying 
to Nicosia the transatlantic requests for the intercommunal 
talks to continue and the pro-Turkish "solution" to be accepted. 
We remember how we stayed in the NATO consortium, the bases 
that were supposed to leave but remained, the exploit of the 
courageous Greek Armed Forces during the 1987 crisis in order to 
"put over" the postponing (at NATO inspiration) of our exerting 
our sovereign rights in the Aegean. We have not forgotten the 
first Davos conference (Papandreou-Papoulias) with the Americans 
behind the scenes (as they of course were during the second 
Davos conference of Mitsotakis-Samaras). 
  What stance will the prime minister take in Washington? Will 
he stress the Turkish regime's natural fascist, expansionist 
character, which is being supported by the United States and 
presented as a model? Will he remind them of the Armenian and 
Pontian genocides, the September Revolution, the deportations, 
and other measures against Greeks and the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate? Measures that are still in effect. Will he 
condemn Ankara's behavior in Cyprus and northern Kurdistan, the 
Aegean, and Thrace? Will he refer to the murder of Theofilos 
Yeoryiadhis [in Cyprus]? Will he say that due to its nature, 
the Turkish regime is violating human rights each day? That it 
is continuously widening economic inequalities that arouse the 
public's discontent (as also expressed at the expansion of 
Islamism)? Will he underline the dangers of encouraging the 
Albanian authorities' antiminority policy and the Skopjean 
ideology? 
  Will the prime minister tell the U.S. President that after 
20 
years of fruitless negotiations on Cyprus--during which the 
Turkish side has gradually hardened its demands while at the 
same time carrying out more illegal actions--Greece believes 
that no more talks should be held until all the Turkish troops 
and settlers withdraw from the island unconditionally, until the 
pseudostate renounces its claimed status, and until the basic 
freedoms of all Cypriots are restored? Will Greece stress that 
it will not give up any of its sovereign rights in the Aegean 
and that it will guard its sovereignty in Thrace? Will the 
prime minister strongly defend the just Greek positions in 
Macedonia and North Ipiros? 
  This stance, which is the only beneficial one for the 
nation, 
would bring Greeks everywhere closer. It would make the 
activity of Greek-Americans particularly effective. 
  Let us hope that the prime minister will not give in to 
pressure from Washington to make concessions on our national 
issues. For example, that it will not agree to support further 
discussion on the confidence-building measures on Cyprus because 
they favor the Turkish schemes. That it will not legalize 
Turkey's expansion and its machinations against Greece by 
accepting a third Davos conference. That it will not agree to 
"freeze Greek-Turkish disputes," even with NATO "guarantees," 
because its political vision is well known. 
  If we followed such recommendations, the repercussions would 
be very negative and the "trade" for Greek-American business 
access to the Balkans unacceptable (even financially 
unprofitable).

<F P=106> [Report by Y. Karelias] </F>
  [Excerpts] The outcome of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] congress will set in motion a series of developments 
and at the same time clarify the terms of the game that Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou will be expected to play when he 
jumps over to the Presidency and abandons the leadership of the 
party he established. 
  The PASOK Central Committee will confer immediately after 
Easter to elect a new secretary and a new Executive Office. 
This means: 
<H5>  Changes </H5>
  -- If Akis Tsokhatzopoulos chooses to stay with the party, 
he must resign his post as interior minister. Yesterday he 
said: "I have been with the party for 20 years and I feel at 
home." Close associates believe he will choose the position of 
secretary. According to the same associates, Papandreou will 
support him. -- A Cabinet reshuffle will follow because there 
will be a vacancy at the Interior Ministry and possibly in other 
ministries if Papandreou decides that others--except 
Tsokhatzopoulos--must stay only with the party. With the 
revision of the PASOK Constitution the day before yesterday, at 
least nine of the 19 members cannot be ministers. Information 
has it that Konstandinos Simitis and Yerasimos Arsenis are not 
expected to leave their ministries, while it is not known what 
will happen with Theodhoros Pangalos, who shot up to the Central 
Committee's second slot after Yeoryios Yenimatas. [passage 
omitted] 
  The governing party is directly interest in electing a 
secretary and an Executive Office. If Tsokhatzopoulos is a 
candidate and has Papandreou's support, then there may be no 
second candidacy, although many who want the position do not 
reveal their intentions. If Tsokhatzopoulos decides to stay with 
the government or if the prime minister does not support him 
openly for the position of secretary, other members of the party 
will surely contest the top slot. 
  Kostas Laliotis said yesterday that "Akis [Tsokhatzopoulos] 
has the first word. He must evaluate the facts and make his 
decisions." Asked whether he would have preferred the position 
of secretary or a ministry, Dhimitrios Tsovolas said: "The 
position of secretary--to upgrade the party." Theodhoros 
Pangalos appears to be "indifferent." He said that he wanted to 
get elected to the Central Committee but had no interest in the 
position. No one knows what he will do at the meeting. 
Besides, it is well known that Pangalos is one of the few 
Executive Office members who was elected to the Central 
Committee without being proposed by Papandreou. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Peter Pelinka </F>
in Atlanta on 18 April: "Vranitzky: How I See Bill Clinton"] 
  [Text] [Pelinka] Mr. Vranitzky, you visited President 
George Bush at the White House two years ago. What is the 
difference between him and Bill Clinton in your view? 
  [Vranitzky] The atmosphere was correct and even friendly. 
Yet it would have been difficult for me to discuss social and 
employment issues with him. This is completely different with 
Bill Clinton. I met him in 1991 during a meeting of the 
so-called Bilderberger in Baden-Baden, during which these issues 
were also discussed. Basically, however, it is not up to me to 
define the differences in the styles of two U.S. Presidents. As 
a small country that was liberated in 1945 and became fully 
independent in 1955 with the help of the large United States, 
Austria's main interest must be to raise its profile in the 
United States. 
  [Pelinka] You seem to be visiting the United States quite 
often. 
  [Vranitzky] During numerous visits -- formerly as a 
financial manager and now as chancellor -- I have noticed that 
Austria is not really represented on a large scale. The second 
reason for my frequent visits is a political one -- specifically 
the joint interest of our two countries in the stabilization of 
Central and East Europe, and the joint interest in a stronger 
United Nations that has one of its headquarters in Vienna. 
  [Pelinka] In this respect, you proposed the convening of a 
conference in Vienna for the settlement of the economic problems 
in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Don't you think that 
there have been enough conferences on this topic? Are the real 
problems not somewhere else -- particularly in view of the 
tragedy of Gorazde? Is the planned reconstruction of in this 
largely destroyed region topical at a time when a bloody war is 
still raging there? 
  [Vranitzky] Like everybody who is dealing intensively with 
this problem, I am a little helpless. After the adoption of the 
cease-fire in and around Sarajevo, the Serbs have again started 
massive armed aggressions. First, the armed hostilities must 
now be stopped with all means that seem useful. However, 
generally, I am afraid that it will be even more difficult to 
find a political solution for the postwar period. The world 
community is currently very reserved in this conflict. For this 
reason, I will submit my proposal. We Austrians are not 
entitled to call for a stronger military commitment because we 
cannot participate. 
  [Pelinka] Don't you think that the proposal that you are 
presenting here in the United States might be interpreted as 
another sign that the Europeans again want a stronger U.S. 
commitment because they themselves cannot solve the problem? 
  [Vranitzky] In this specific case, this is not true because 
the proposal was coordinated with Bonn, Rome, and Helsinki. 
  [Pelinka] Many Europeans, particularly conservative ones, 
are currently displaying anti-Americanism. Has it been 
triggered by the disappointment about the failure of 
Reaganomics, and by the insight that the United States has 
remained a superpower -- in fact, the only one -- but that it no 
longer is the leading conservative power in a Cold War that no 
longer exists? 
  [Vranitzky] Reaganomics has proved inefficient and is 
outdated. However, I have never believed that European and U.S. 
interests can be separated, and that efforts to assign the 
United States a leading role in the Far East are not useful. 
The United States has always intervened at the right time -- in 
the Panama conflict against Noriega, in the Gulf war against 
Saddam, now in Sarajevo, and in the Middle East Peace process. 
Despite all reservations against the U.S. system -- in the 
social and health spheres, for example -- it has always proven 
to be able to renew itself. 
  [Pelinka] Are you saying that Europe should not increase its 
distance from the United States if the European Union [EU] turns 
out to be successful, or if the Western European Union becomes 
stronger and even turns into an alternative to NATO? 
  [Vranitzky] Particularly from the Austrian viewpoint, a 
greater distance would be nonsense. We must not advocate 
Eurocentrism, and we must not pretend that Europe can become a 
fortress. As far as the military aspect is concerned, 
membership in NATO is not topical. We are primarily interested 
in the creation of a European security system. 
  [Pelinka] Austria has a large trade deficit vis-a-vis the 
United States. Our exports involve 15 billion schillings and 
our imports 25 billion. Will we be able to develop more 
strength in the U.S. market once we are a member of the EU? 
  [Vranitzky] We must not rely on others in this respect. 
Everything depends exclusively on our own strength. Let me give 
you a few positive examples: The BMW works in Steyr, the 
development of a Diesel engine for passenger vehicles, the 
establishment of a BMW factory in the United States, and the 
development of an Austrian-produced Diesel motor for this 
factory. This became possible because our tax reform has made 
investment in Austria more attractive for BMW.

<F P=106> [Renaud Girard report: "Juppe: A `Political Plan' Is </F>
Needed"] 
  [Text] [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe said in a news 
conference yesterday that the extension of air strikes to 
protect all safe areas in Bosnia "is pointless unless it is part 
of a political plan." The "armchair strategists" who are 
demanding indiscriminate strikes do not want to understand this, 
the foreign minister said sarcastically. 
  Following two years of shelling by the Serbs of the six 
Bosnian cities which form the UN safe areas, what "political 
plan" are we talking about? For Mr. Juppe, the aim is first to 
secure a common stance by Russia, the United States, Europe, and 
the United Nations. 
  The minister found the period of one month "rather long" for 
convening an international summit on Bosnia, which Washington 
and Moscow have agreed in principle and which has been welcomed 
with "satisfaction" by Francois Mitterrand. However, Mr. Juppe 
stressed that such a summit should be "conclusive;" it must be 
prepared by meetings at the level of ministers and experts. 
<H5>  Use of Force </H5>
  Mr. Juppe added: "We are permanently on the edge of the 
abyss. We must move more quickly in seeking a political solution 
to the conflict." The theme has constantly dominated the many 
conferences (Geneva, London, or Athens) for two years, "peace 
plans" (Vance-Owen, Stoltenberg, and so forth), and other "joint 
action programs" which have been dreamed up by the international 
community to restore peace to Bosnia. We have seen how 
successful they have been. 
  He admitted that NATO "was wrong" not to strike in Gorazde. 
But he also repeated that "there was no question of engaging in 
a military reconquest of Bosnia." Alain Juppe is therefore 
arguing for a veritable "sanctuarization" of the safe areas. 
  The minister chided that "sanctuarization" is probably a 
word 
which would not have been used by the "armchair strategists." 
But these "armchairs" are also to be found in New York: in the 
UN Security Council where France has a permanent seat, with the 
right of veto. 
  It is at least one year since that body was supposed to have 
defined a policy for Bosnia. By its Resolution 836 of 4 June 
1993, the Council authorizes the use of force to protect the 
safe areas which it had instituted a month earlier. On 31 March 
1993 (Resolution 816), the Council had also authorized the use 
of force to ensure respect for the "air exclusion zone" decreed 
six months earlier. This second resolution has been violated 
more than 1,000 times. 
  One essential question remains unanswered. Is there also an 
"armchair policy?"

  [Text] At the diplomatic level, everybody seems to agree 
now on the organization of a summit between the United States, 
Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations within a 
month. This is exactly what France demanded. The proposal has 
been accepted by Yeltsin and Clinton. At the military level, 
NATO should respond within 48 hours to the UN request for air 
strikes. All this is very complicated and very dramatic as 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe admitted: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We have to obtain a real cease-fire 
and not a cease-fire on paper as we have been told for 48 hours 
now, and the withdrawal of Serbian troops. If these conditions 
are met and if the situation in Sarajevo is back to normal as it 
is happening now, then an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] force 
should be deployed in Gorazde to act as a buffer to enable the 
arrival of humanitarian aid because it is urgent to do so as 
there are 60,000 people whose food stock will not last more than 
three days. Secondly, we have to make sure that other tragedies 
similar to Gorazde's do not happen by securing the safe havens. 
We are discussing this with the Americans and I hope that we 
will at last do what France has been demanding for some months 
now, that is to anticipate proportionate air strikes in safe 
havens if the population is attacked. For this we will have to 
define the exclusion zones and the strict rules of engagement 
that we are working out now. Finally, we have to repeat again 
that whatever our determination to use air power, there is no 
lasting solution other than a political one. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Kurt Kister report: "Bill Clinton in a Thankless Role"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 21 Apr -- What seemed unthinkable two 
months ago is now going to be attempted, it seems. The U.S. 
President wants to extend the Sarajevo model to five other 
cities in Bosnia which the United Nations declared as safe 
zones. Gorazde is one of them, and yet another in a series of 
live broadcasts of that city's bloody siege by the Serbs has 
compelled President Clinton to assume once again a role he does 
not like, that of a world leader. As far as Bosnian issues are 
concerned, such a role is infinitely difficult and thankless, 
also because the army of armchair strategists, Balkan experts, 
and aerial warfare analysts immediately criticize any decision 
as too late, too hesitant, too belligerent, or too dangerous. 
  It is not yet certain whether the NATO countries, especially 
those with troops in Bosnia, will agree to an expansion of the 
air forces' assignment. Just as uncertain is whether Moscow 
really is prepared to take part in the possible bombing of even 
those Serbian military facilities that do not pose a direct 
threat to UN forces. After all, this possibility of bombing 
forms the nucleus of the Sarajevo model: Unlike the case in 
Gorazde so far, in Sarajevo NATO said that it would attack more 
than just individual tanks or artillery pieces to provide 
so-called air support for the blue helmets. NATO said it would 
expand its targets to include anything that fires upon civilians 
within a radius of 20 km of Sarajevo. 
  This certainly amounts to an escalation, because according 
to 
the Sarajevo model, air attacks do not serve tactical purposes 
such as the protection of friendly troops, but strategic 
purposes such as the protection of foreign civilians and forcing 
a withdrawal by the attackers. But NATO is not just trying to 
avoid a Gorazde-type massacre. It is also attempting to take 
the side of one of the parties to the conflict. This is exactly 
what many critics of the so-far hesitant NATO want. 
  Just as many people in Europe consider U.S. aerial attacks a 
wonderful tactic, many in Washington believe in the lifting of 
the arms embargo against Bosnia. The Senate has voted 
four-fifths in favor of this, and more and more leading figures 
are arguing that the United States should cancel the embargo, if 
necessary without the approval of the United Nations or other 
NATO allies. "Let the Bosnians defend themselves," they 
suggest, meaning: "Then we will not have to be involved any 
more." 
  Clinton is considerably more careful here. Although he has 
been calling for a lifting of the arms embargo ever since he 
took office, he only wants to do so together with the allies. 
In the White House, people fear that if the United States makes 
any moves on its own, it might suddenly be stuck with the 
commitment to deliver weapons to the Bosnians, and possibly also 
teach them how to use them, which would hardly be a reduction in 
U.S. involvement. In addition, what can the United States do if 
other countries unilaterally declare a lifting of arms 
embargoes, for example those against Iraq or Libya?

  [Text] Ankara, April 20 (AA) -- The Foreign Ministry on 
Wednesday [20 April] said that relations between Turkey and 
Germany have very strong foundations, adding neither country 
should allow third countries or circles to hurt them. 
  Speaking at his weekly briefing on Wednesday, he said that 
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has personally confirmed 
the fact that German tanks were not used by Turkey in its 
operations carried out against terrorists. 
  He said that from time to time misunderstandings can emerge 
between two countries, which in turn lead to certain 
difficulties. 
  "What matters is that both countries should be determined to 
overcome them," Ataman said. "Both countries have the necessary 
political will for this. Turkey hopes the strengthening of 
existing mutual trust will help to overcome these 
misunderstandings."

  [Text] The meeting between Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou and U.S. President Bill Clinton this evening at the 
White House is anticipated with great interest. Our 
correspondent in Washington Mirella Kalostipi reported that the 
two leaders will discuss the situation in the Balkans, the 
problem between Athens and Skopje, the Bosnian crisis, the 
Cyprus issue, the tension in Greek-Turkish and Greek-Albanian 
relations and also the further improvement of relations between 
Greece and United States. 
  It should be noted that while addressing Prime Minister 
Papandreou last night at the reception in his honor, the U.S. 
President appeared particularly warm toward Greece and 
Papandreou, and expressed the certainty that their talks would 
be successful.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- The Duesseldorf police 
president has banned a "demonstration with subsequent children's 
festival" that was planned by Kurds in the North 
Rhine-Westphalian capital for Saturday [23 April]. To justify 
this ban, it was said on Thursday that this event could be 
organized by the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). This, 
however, would be a direct danger to "public order and 
security." A large number of policemen will, if necessary, 
enforce the ban "consistently," it was said. Participants who 
travel to Duesseldorf from outside are to be "caught" when 
entering the city.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`PARIS MATCH -- BVA Opinion Poll: </F>
The Fall of Prime Minister Balladur (Down 9 Percent)"] 
  [Text] The latest "PARIS MATCH -- BVA" opinion poll, 
conducted after the withdrawal of the CIP [youth job training 
contract] but before the suicide of [President's Mitterrand's 
adviser] Francois de Grossouvre, shows a real drop in Edouard 
Balladur's popularity. He has lost 9 percent, posting his worst 
score since he took office. His popularity rating is negative 
for the first time and is now below that of Francois Mitterrand. 
It should be noted that the prime minister's rating has dropped 
considerably (down 15 percent), compared with people with more 
centrist views. The government as a whole has been affected by 
this fall from grace since, also for the first time, the French 
people -- if they were deputies -- would not support the 
government in a confidence vote (49 percent no's as opposed to 
39 percent yes-votes). As a result of this situation, the Left 
has gained 3 percent in legislative election voting intentions. 
The Left-Right balance of power is now 34-44.

  This survey was conducted in a series of one-on-one 
interviews with a representative sample of the French population 
over age 18. The questions for the ratings poll were put to 928 
people between 31 March and 6 April 1994, while 3,747 people 
were asked their general election voting intentions between 15 
March and 18 March 1994, and between 31 March and 6 April 1994. 
Voting intentions were calculated on the basis of people listed 
on the electoral registers. Sampling was done using the quota 
method: sex, age, profession of the head of the household, 
region, and category of town. The results should be seen in the 
light of a margin of error common to all opinion polls and 
related to the size of the sample. These margins of error are: 
more or less one or two points for voting intentions; more or 
less two or three points for overall results; and more or less 
four or five points for the results for the major political 
groups.

  [Editorial Report] Articles reporting on the popularity of 
the government and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur continue to 
appear in the French press. 
<H5>  "Secret" Survey </H5>
  According to Catherine Pegard writing in the 9 April Paris 
weekly LE POINT, a large-scale "secret" survey is being 
conducted nationwide by the Central Office for Polling and 
Statistics on behalf of the Renseignements Generaux (RG) 
following a request by Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua. 
According to Pegard, Balladur is the survey's principal theme. 
Out of 32 questions included in the survey, Pegard cites the 
following: 
  "Do you believe that Edouard Balladur is presently carrying 
out an in-depth course of action aimed at preparing France for 
the future, or a limited course of action aimed at preparing the 
presidential elections?" 
  "Can you tell me if you agree or disagree with the following 
opinions? 
  --"Edouard Balladur's government is right in proceeding 
prudently, for French society is fragile. 
  --"Edouard Balladur's government is carrying out an in-depth 
course of action by preparing the foundation for our country's 
recovery. 
  -- "Sometimes the government meets with obstacles. This was 
to be expected. Everything will be simpler after the 
presidential elections. 
  -- "No other policy but Balladur's is possible. No one could 
do better. 
  --"The government is doing all it can under difficult 
circumstances. One must be patient and trusting. 
  --"The situation is more serious than it is admitted, and 
the 
government has not sufficiently taken into account the realities 
and problems of the French people." 
  According to Pegard, the survey also includes a series of 
questions related to political figures such as Balladur, 
potential presidential candidate Raymond Barre, Rally for the 
Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, Union for French Democracy 
(UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, EU Commission President 
Jacques Delors, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, Minister 
of Interior Charles Pasqua, National Front (FN) leader 
Jean-Marie Le Pen, Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard, 
and President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin. The 
survey seeks to determine the degree of "trust" they inspire in 
solving problems ranging from unemployment to morals, societal 
cohesion, and AIDS. 
<H5>  Poll Results </H5>
  The 7 April Paris weekly PARIS MATCH published the results 
of 
a BVA poll conducted on 18-19 March on behalf of PARIS MATCH, 
France 2, France 3, Europe 1 and the daily newspaper LIBERATION 
among a representative sample of 968 individuals over 18. 
Respondents were asked to answer the following questions: 
  "I will cite the names of the principal ministers in Edouard 
Balladur's government. Can you tell me which are the five 
ministers whose course of action you liked the most in the past 
year?" 
  Some 61 percent chose Charles Pasqua, 45 percent chose 
Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil, 42 percent Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe, 41 percent Minister of Defense 
Francois Leotard, and 25 percent Minister of the Budget Nicolas 
Sarkozy. A number of other ministers obtained scores below 25 
percent. 
  "Out of the following personalities, tell me who, in your 
opinion, would have obtained better results, worse results, or 
results comparable to Balladur's if appointed prime minister." 
  Some 23 percent said Pasqua would have obtained "better 
results," 33 percent "worse results," 41 percent "comparable," 
and 3 percent did not know. 
  Twenty-two percent said Raymond Barre would have obtained 
"better results," 35 percent "worse results," 42 percent 
"comparable," and 1 percent did not know. 
  Fifteen percent said Chirac would have obtained "better 
results," 39 percent "worse results," 44 percent "comparable," 
and 2 percent did not know. 
  Twelve percent said Seguin would have obtain "better 
results," 40 percent "worse results," 41 percent "comparable," 
and 7 percent did not know. 
  Some 11 percent said Valery Giscard d'Estaing would have 
obtained "better results," 53 percent "worse results," 34 
percent "comparable," and 2 percent did not know. 
  "In the next few months, do you want Balladur's government 
to...." 
  Follow the same economic policy: 36 percent 
  Change its economic policy: 61 percent 
  Do not know: 3 percent 
  "With regard to fighting unemployment, when do you think it 
would be possible to determine the success or failure of 
Balladur's policy?" 
  Right now: 14 percent 
  At the end of 1994: 22 percent 
  In March 1995, after two years of government action: 59 
percent 
  Later: 4 percent 
  Do not know: 1 percent.

  [Editorial Report] With the presidential elections barely 
a year away, deputies and potential candidates are thinking only 
of this "polluting" timetable, Philippe Reinhard writes in the 5 
April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. A country that subordinates all 
action to an election in spite of the urgency of existing 
problems is not a "modern democracy," he comments, for its fate 
depends "on a throw of the dice." While the government is 
announcing a significant legislative program, parliamentarians 
will instead devote their time to evaluating the chances of 
various presidential candidates. According to whether they 
follow Prime Minister Edouard Balladur or Rally for the Republic 
(RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, or whether they support French 
Democratic Union (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing or Senate 
President Rene Monory, their conduct will lead to the 
fragmentation of the parliamentary majority, Reinhard contends. 
He warns that parliamentarians ought to let the government 
govern at least until the vote on the 1995 budget, as 
"quarreling in public can only serve the interests of a Left 
whose convalescence is distinctly faster than its adversaries 
seem to think." 
  According to an article in the 6 April satirical Paris 
weekly 
LE CANARD ENCHAINE, Chirac supporters have launched an 
"insidious" campaign by attacking Balladur's physical and 
psychological state, which they contend has deteriorated "now 
that everything is going badly." They are spreading the rumor 
that the "increasingly tired and discouraged" prime minister 
will not complete his term in office. The article cites Eric 
Raoult, one of Balladur's harshest critics and vice president of 
the RPR in the National Assembly, as saying that Balladur "can 
resign on a moment's notice." Chirac supporters also contend 
that were Balladur to leave, Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain 
Juppe would be his likeliest successor, since he maintains good 
relations with President Francois Mitterrand and has no 
presidential ambitions. 
  According to the article, after Alain Juppe's reelection as 
secretary general of the RPR National Council, the defense 
minister presented his activities report, in which he expressed 
satisfaction that the party has become "the most important 
French political force." He then turned to the 1995 presidential 
elections, affirming that the RPR is "loyal to Edouard Balladur 
and faithful to Jacques Chirac" and pointing out that "our party 
possesses all the trump cards to win the presidential elections, 
but the surest way to waste them is to compromise our unity by 
giving in to the delights of clans." For his part, Chirac called 
for "unfailing support" for the prime minister, stating that "I 
would like to tell him in a friendly manner: Do not be alarmed, 
dear Edouard, by the suggestions that members of your majority 
may make to you, for they are dictated only by the desire to 
succeed together." 
  In an interview with National Assembly President Philippe 
Seguin by Frederic Gerschel published in the 14 April Paris 
weekly PARIS MATCH, Seguin was asked whether the government 
would not function more "serenely" if, "rightly or wrongly," 
presidential ambitions were not attributed to Balladur. Seguin 
replied that Balladur himself stated in June 1990 that a prime 
minister who renounces publicly from the outset to run for 
president gains both efficiency and authority. When queried 
whether his favorite candidate for president is still Chirac, 
Seguin pointed out that the problem is less that of candidates, 
of whom "there is a plethora," than of a presidential project, 
of which there is still a distinct lack. The presidential 
election, he added, must be the occasion for a renewed "elan," 
which can only be founded on a clear project. The French people 
will thus base their choice on the quality of the candidate, but 
also on his capability to bring new answers to the present great 
challenges, Seguin concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia/Italy: Andreatta to Kozyrev: </F>
`We Count on Russian Influence'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 18 -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta has today sent an urgent message concerning 
the dramatic events underway in Gorazde to his Russian 
counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, a Farnesina [Foreign Ministry] 
communique said this evening. 
  In the letter, Andreatta recalled recent bilateral 
consultations in Budapest and underscored the urgent need to see 
to it that all the efforts of the entire international community 
converge so as to head off the humanitarian catastrophe that 
United Nations' bodies in Bosnia are warning of. 
  The immediate goal to pursue, he said, was a cease-fire 
coupled with the withdrawal to a sufficient distance of Serbian 
troops from the city of Gorazde. 
  Furthermore, maximum impetus must be given to efforts to get 
negotiations underway lest they lose both their credibility and 
effectiveness, the Italian diplomatic chief continued. 
  The Serbian side, too, should be aware of this and "we count 
heavily on Russian influence to make this happen," Andreatta 
said in the message. 
  At this point, the Italian minister reminded his Russian 
counterpart of Italy's commitment to the search of suitable 
formulas to charge up the process of international 
consultations, starting with the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
"A process which should reflect substantial, decisive 
contributions," and to which the Russian Federation, "with its 
prestige and its political weight", could greatly contribute, he 
said.

  [Editorial Report] The political platforms of Forza 
Italia, the National Alliance, and the Northern League--the 
three parties which together won the national elections held 
27-28 March--can provide some clues on what type of government 
program the coalition is likely to propose. A review of those 
platforms as presented in the press also indicates that several 
fundamental differences in the ideologies of the three parties 
may not only make the formation of a government difficult, but 
also limit its longevity. 
<H5>  Fiscal Policy </H5>
  While all three parties agree that Italy's tremendous budget 
deficit must be reduced, they differ on how this should be 
accomplished. Forza Italia proposes establishing a public debt 
reduction fund and a constitutional guarantee that public 
expenditures will be covered in full. The National Alliance 
proposes reducing the deficit gradually, by reducing the number 
of government securities issued, with the exception of those 
intended to finance public works. It also favors using Treasury 
bonds to pay off the debts of public companies that are slated 
to be dismantled. The Northern League believes the public debt 
should be eliminated altogether, in this way reducing inflation 
and allowing for a monetary policy that would promote 
development. All three believe the personal income tax (IRPEF) 
and corporate income tax (IRPEG) must be reduced, with Forza 
Italia and the Northern League proposing a 30 percent ceiling on 
the IRPEF for everyone, and Forza Italia also proposing that the 
present 200 different taxes be reduced to 10. Both the Northern 
League and Forza Italia advocate "fiscal federalism," giving the 
power to collect all taxes to local agencies. Local agencies 
would in turn give a certain percentage of the collected 
revenues to the central government, or to the "macroregions" 
favored by the League as components of their federalist plan. 
However, the National Alliance proposes instead that a new 
balance be established between taxes for the central government 
and those for the local agencies, with the latter as a 
substitute, not as an addition to the present local taxes. All 
three parties propose a tax rate for each family based on the 
number of dependents, and agree that personal savings and state 
securities should not be taxed. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 22 
March). 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  Forza Italia belives that newly created jobs should not be 
taxed and that a "cushion" should be created between employment 
and unemployment in the form of apprenticeships. The Northern 
League proposes reducing fiscal pressure on employers, 
introducing salary limitations, and flexibility in work 
schedules. The National Alliance is convinced unemployment 
affects the South particularly and therefore asks for a new 
employment policy for that area. It proposes public investments 
in the manufacturing sector and a relaunch of private production 
activity through a resumption of public works. (Milan CORRIERE 
DELLA SERA, 26 March). 
<H5>  Health Insurance </H5>
  Forza Italia proposes that health services be privatized, 
with the state providing coverage only for those persons who 
cannot afford private insurance. In that case, public funds 
would not be disbursed to hospitals, but directly to the 
citizens in the form of nonnegotiable personal coupons to be 
used to purchase private insurance. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 
26 March). The League calls for abolishing mandatory 
participation in the universal health plan and a free choice of 
private insurance coverage, with a mixed public-private system 
that would include free health care to the needy. (Rome IL 
MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance espouses an 
overhaul of current health services to guarantee standardized 
assistance throughout the country. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 
26 March). 
<H5>  Pensions </H5>
  Both Forza Italia and the League have called for a gradual 
move to a private pension system, with the state providing 
pensions for only certain underprivileged categories (Forza 
Italia), and the revision of disability pensions (League). 
According to the National Alliance, everyone is entitled to a 
minimum pension, with those who want and can afford it allowed 
to choose a private pension plan "after they have met their 
obligation to the less fortunate." (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 
26 March). 
<H5>  Institutional Reform </H5>
  Forza Italia proposes the direct election of the president 
of 
the Republic, who would have the power to nominate the prime 
minister and to dissolve both chambers of parliament, in the 
latter case forcing his own resignation. According to this 
proposal, the government would have to receive a vote of 
confidence from parliament in order to avoid dismissal of the 
government and dissolution of the chambers. The League has 
agreed to reform the state without creating the three republics 
it originally proposed. If the reform succeeds in diminishing 
the distance economic and social separation between North and 
South, a "light federalism" will be sufficient, but if a "strong 
federalism" is required, this will be achieved peacefully. 
(Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The federalism proposed 
by the League is based on macroregions and the direct election 
of the prime minister and president of the Republic, who would 
be the guarantor of the national Constitution. (Rome IL 
MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance advocates a 
presidential republic and a popular referendum to guarantee 
democracy. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The Alliance 
also believes in a strong executive, the direct election of the 
prime minister, and further reform of the electoral law. (Rome 
IL MESSAGGERO, 27 March). 
<H5>  Foreign Policy </H5>
  Forza Italia believes the United Nations should be reformed, 
and that Italy's participation should be evaluated based on 
national interests. Italy should continue membership in NATO, 
Forza Italia says, but Italian participation in this 
organization should also be reviewed. It also believes in a 
common European defense system and in maintaining a "highly 
qualified" Italian military. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March). 
The League wants a unified Europe and believes NATO is the only 
viable defense system for Europe until a common European defense 
system is established (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March), but 
calls for greater European presence in NATO. Italy's military 
should include a mix of volunteers and draftees, says the 
League, and conscientious objection should be recognized. The 
League also calls for aid to East Europe and Third World 
countries to encourage local development, and for prohibiting 
the immigration of non-EU [European Union] citizens without work 
contracts. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March). The National 
Alliance proposes a European seat in NATO and extending NATO 
membership to East European countries. It proposes moving 
towards European unification by annulling the peace treaty of 
1947, while respecting the national diversity of its members. 
The territories of Istria and Dalmatia, the Alliance declares, 
must acquire multiethnic autonomy through new international 
accords. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). According to 
IL SOLE--24 ORE of 15 March, the National Alliance has a broad 
foreign policy agenda that includes reattaching Istria and 
Dalmatia to Italy, creating employment opportunities in Third 
World countries to stem the tide of non-EU immigrants, rejecting 
the Maastricht Treaty, establishing a European Confederation 
that would promote European nationalism against the United 
States and Russia, and creating a totally professional Italian 
army.

<F P=106> ["I.C." report: "Javier Solana Holds Russia and United </F>
States Responsible for Gorazde's Plight"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
yesterday attributed part of the responsibility for the plight 
of the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, besieged and harried by the 
Bosnian Serb forces, to U.S. and Russian "indiscretions." 
During his appearance before the Congress of Deputies Foreign 
Affairs Committee, Solana recalled NATO's two air strikes 
against the troops besieging the city, but deplored the 
statements by Russian President Boris Yeltsin: "In my opinion, 
his words gave the Serb forces some hope." "Perhaps a permanent 
member of the (UN) Security Council should have weighed his 
words more carefully," because they reduced the effectiveness of 
the NATO action, he added. The minister attributed Yeltsin's 
"mistakes" to factors relating to the domestic policy of Russia, 
a country where nationalist feeling is on the increase. 
  The Russian head of state, who was in Madrid at the 
beginning 
of last week, just after the NATO attack, criticized the use of 
force by the alliance, complained that Moscow had not been 
consulted or even informed, and urged continuing to negotiate. 
  In milder terms, Solana intimated his bewilderment about the 
Clinton administration's recent actions. He recalled that both 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the U.S. chief of 
staff had ruled out strikes against the Serbs hours before they 
finally occurred. "It is true that there were statements -- 
fortunate or otherwise -- which gave cause for the senseless 
Bosnian Serb forces to make decisions (to attack), perhaps 
believing that they were safe because of the international 
community's inaction." 
  As a result of Washington's and Moscow's "indiscretions," 
"the Bosnian Serb forces' position is now a strengthened 
position," the minister stressed, and he warned: "Until the 
international community presents a united front, the Serbs will 
take advantage of any chink." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed SK: "Total Ban on Chemical Weapons -- The </F>
Federal Council Wants To Ratify the International Convention"] 
  [Text] Bern, 20 Apr (ATSA) -- Switzerland should ratify the 
international convention banning chemical weapons and calling 
for their destruction. The Federal Council made this proposal 
to the Assembly in a message that was adopted on Wednesday [13 
April]. The convention is the first disarmament treaty for an 
entire category of mass-destruction weapons. Switzerland has no 
chemical weapons. 
  In January 1993, Switzerland signed the convention that bans 
the design, manufacture, storage, and use of chemical weapons. 
The participating states also pledged never to help anyone 
undertake activities breaking this convention. Besides, all 
existing stocks of chemicals weapons must be destroyed, as well 
as the plants innvolved in the making of such weapons and the 
weapons left by a state on foreign territory. 
  An exhaustive monitoring system -- extended to the civilian 
chemical industry -- will be set up to ensure that the 
convention is complied with. An international organization on 
banning chemical weapons will be established in The Hague to 
carry out this monitoring function. Over 150 states have signed 
the convention up till now, including Switzerland in January 
1993. 
<H5>  No Problem for Switzerland </H5>
  In its message, the Federal Council stressed that 
Switzerland 
itself does not have any mass-destruction weapons. It considers 
that the convention on chemical weapons is, together with the 
nonproliferation treaty, the most important multilateral treaty 
in the security field. The elimination of chemical weapons will 
reduce the risk of a serious military threat. The government 
further says that the destruction of such weapons will have to 
respect the environment. 
  The government underlines that the Swiss chemical industry 
unreservedly adheres to the objectives of the convention. 
Implementing this convention does not require creating new 
institutions or laws, but nevertheless implies considerable 
monitoring activities.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by </F>
Elmar Oberhauser; Vranitzky in Washington -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Oberhauser] Good evening, Mr. Chancellor. 
  [Vranitzky] Hello, Mr. Oberhauser. 
  [Oberhauser] I begin with something that you have just 
experienced. Mr. Chancellor, what was the talk with President 
Clinton like, from your point of view? 
  [Vranitzky] From my point of view and, I think, also from 
his point of view, it was a very good talk. We not only talked 
about Bosnia, we not only talked about Bosnia's reconstruction 
after the end of the disastrous war but we expressed common 
views and will also prepare something for this purpose. We 
talked about Partnership for Peace as a next step in Europe and 
noted that Austria has already tackled a number of activities 
before this idea came about. I told him that yesterday we were 
in close contact with Congress in order to discuss the problem 
of financing nuclear power plants in neighboring states once 
more and we moved on with a message that was not bad at all. In 
short, I also gave him advance notice of an invitation to make a 
stopover in Vienna on his way to the CSCE summit in Budapest at 
the end of the year. 
  [Oberhauser] Have you already received an answer to that? 
  [Vranitzky] Well, he said that he would like to accept this 
invitation if political developments in the United States permit 
it. This is an answer that one probably has to accept. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, we are waiting here in suspense 
for his television speech on Bosnia. What is his attitude on 
this matter at the moment? 
  [Vranitzky] Within the next hour -- if it takes that long at 
all -- you will hear his statements, and I would be grateful to 
you if you concentrated on Clinton's original statements and did 
not expect me to give you some sort of summary before the speech 
is actually made. 
  [Oberhauser] After this talk, do you see any chance that 
progress will be made, that there is indeed a path toward peace 
in Bosnia? 
  [Vranitzky] Mr. Oberhauser, I see such a chance, but I would 
have seen it also without this talk. However, my talk with 
Clinton has confirmed my view, because it is inconceivable that 
the international community ceases its efforts in view of 
Gorazde. He told me that he had talked to Mitterand and Chretien 
and with other NATO leaders and that he will continue to do so. 
This means, he will develop a large-scale diplomatic and 
political initiative. This is certainly indispensable and 
correct and necessary. 
  [Oberhauser] How was your suggestion accepted to convene a 
conference for the reconstruction of Bosnia in Vienna? 
  [Vranitzky] Positively. 
  [Oberhauser] With approval? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, it was accepted with approval. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> Report by Robert Schlesinger: "A Dual Asylum Recognition </F>
Policy"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- If one asks for the percentage of 
successful asylum applications in Austria, the information given 
on this differs. The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) 
speaks of 7.8 percent for 1993, while the Press Office of the 
Interior Ministry, on the other hand, speaks of a remarkable 
18.47 percent. 
  Both base their calculations on the same absolute figures. 
Last year more than 15,000 applications for asylum were 
processed (the majority of these had been left over from 
previous years); 1,193 were approved, which is 7.8 percent. 
According to the UNHCR's press spokeswoman, Melita Sunjic, this 
method of calculating is the international norm and was also 
used in our country until the new asylum law came into effect. 
  Last year, however, the ministry used a different 
calculation: Only 4,743 new applications were made -- 876 were 
approved, which is 18.47 percent. This figure, which is 
respectable when compared with other states, was achieved 
because, of the 876 asylum-seekers who were accepted, there were 
543 Bosnians, who had to be given asylum on the basis of an 
international agreement. Austria has committed itself to 
granting asylum to 600 Bosnians who have escaped from Serbian 
prison camps. 
  This year, however, even the method of calculating used by 
the ministry in 1993 would yield only 5.86 percent for the first 
quarter. Thus, it is close to the 4.2 percent of the UNHCR 
calculation. However, the method of calculating has been 
changed and the Press Office is proudly reporting 14.43 percent. 
<H5>  Smaller Overall Figure </H5>
  The overall figure was once again reduced: In the first 
three months of 1994 1,263 applications were made; 395 were 
legally decided on, 57 positively -- and 57 out of 395 is 14.43 
percent. 
  Just to check, the UNHCR uses the following method of 
calculation: 3,664 proceedings were concluded, 73 of them by 
withdrawing the application, which leaves 3,591; 152 were 
approved, which is 4.2 percent. 
  Internally, however, the Interior Ministry also insists on 
comparable results: According to one from among the group of 
recipients, Department III/13 of the ministry distributes 
monthly statistics for official use, which is not at all 
identical with the published ones but with that of the UNHCR. 
Among the addressees is the Office of the Chancellor. 
<H5>  Official Statistics </H5>
  Nevertheless, Vranitzky, too, prefers to use the official 
statistics: In his letter of 25 February 1994 to 18 Viennese 
historians who had protested the government's asylum policy, he 
speaks of a successful ratio of 19.29 percent for the period 
between 1 July 1992 and 31 December 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Stefan Ragaz: "Bosnia Testifies to Clinton's </F>
Aimless Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] Washington -- "We have crossed the Rubicon." This 
is the way in which the former U.S. secretary of state and 
former ambassador to Belgrade commented on the failed air 
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. Thus, the only military 
option that is left is the massive shelling of Serbian positions 
in Bosnia and Serbia. 
  In the United States, however, where the signals on the 
future course of policy on Bosnia are contradictory, readiness 
for military escalation is declining. Washington is desperately 
trying to find a way out of the foreign policy quagmire. 
Basically, President Clinton's "considerations" about 
"nondiplomatic methods" against the Serbian besiegers of Gorazde 
do not change anything. 
  Encouraged by European reservations one year ago, and unable 
to lead the United Nations to a credible policy of strength, the 
Clinton Administration is trying to avoid responsibility -- 
particularly in the humanitarian-ethical sphere. Now that it is 
apparently too late to save Gorazde, Serbian hopes are being 
realized: Washington has neither the willingness nor the 
courage to intervene in Bosnia. 
  The case of Gorazde has unmasked U.S. policy on Bosnia: The 
fact that the United States is now afraid of a loss of face is 
the result of a careless foreign policy. Just as in Somalia, 
when Clinton insisted on chasing Aidid, he also misjudged the 
situation in Bosnia. 
  In fact, he gave rise to expectations, particularly among 
the 
victims of the aggressor, but shrank back from the consequences; 
he uttered threats, but he then withdrew with his hesitant 
attitude and readiness for compromise. As a result, doubts 
concerning the moral authority, the determination, and sincerity 
of the United States developed even before Gorazde. Above all, 
the Clinton Administration lacks cohesion. Senator Orin Hatch 
from Utah is critical: "We are referring to the United Nations, 
otherwise the U.S. policy is unclear." The fact that the United 
States continues to accept the UN Security Council as the 
supreme authority and does not take the initiative has become 
the subject of public criticism in Washington. 
  Military planning, too, is characterized by a lack of 
cohesion. The Pentagon has apparently deviated from the Powell 
doctrine and forgotten the lessons of the Vietnam and Gulf wars. 
Colin Powell, general chief of staff under President Bush, 
linked the deployment of U.S. troops with the feasibility of 
military goals and massive superiority on the battlefield. 
  Henry Kissinger believes that the air strikes are only a 
"symbolic tit-for-tat during the final phase of a completed 
operation." 
  The realization that the Serbs are about to achieve the goal 
of "objective cleansing" in the territorial conquest in Bosnia 
also leads to a new realpolitik assessment of the U.S. role in 
Congress. Some in Congress have already called for the complete 
withdrawal from Bosnia, because it is not possible to force the 
Serbs to participate in negotiations by using bombs. Since the 
military options are exhausted, as Kissinger noted, voices 
calling for the abolition of the weapons embargo for the Bosnian 
Muslims are being raised. 
  However, Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, also warns that, in view of Russian resistance in the 
United Nations, an abolition is only conceivable as a unilateral 
act by the United States. But this would mean that Washington 
would have to enter the conflict and wage a large part of the 
war on the side of the Muslims.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Thomas Chorherr: "Austrian Lessons for the </F>
White House"] 
  [Text] Bill Clinton represents a twofold change, this paper 
wrote on 5 November 1992, the day after the election of the 
governor of Arkansas as President of the United States. We 
stressed that he not only stands for change but that he also 
represents a bill on the future. "History will show whether it 
will be honored, and whether it is covered." Earlier than 
expected it has become clear that the bill was drawn on an 
uncovered account. "The Europeans may remain skeptical for the 
time being," the editorial concluded at the time. According to 
the U.S. media, Bill Clinton simply does not understand what is 
going on in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia. For him foreign 
policy is at best an aspect of domestic policy, which has turned 
out to be difficult enough for him. Thus, foreign policy is a 
nuisance for the U.S. President. The political course of the 
current Administration reflects this fact. 
  If Chancellor Franz Vranitzky meets with Bill Clinton today, 
he can claim to represent a small country but one that is 
familiar with the geographic, geopolitical, and historic 
background to the situation in Bosnia and Serbia. Thus, 
Vranitzky can be something like a teacher. He need not act as a 
supplicant but can walk with his head up. Quite the contrary, 
it would be advisable for the President to modify an American 
motto: "When the Austrians talk, we listen." 
  This is not megalomania but realism. Just like Clinton, 
Vranitzky knows that the United Nations is currently going 
through its worst crisis since its founding, as Foreign Minister 
Alois Mock put it pertinently. It has completely lost 
credibility, and the world body does just as the Serbs please. 
At the same time, NATO and the United States have also lost 
everything that was still left of its superpower status. The 
hesitation of the United States to use its military strength to 
defend the alleged ideals of freedom, human dignity, human 
rights, and self-determination is to blame for that. 
  Vranitzky will have to explain to the President today and to 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali tomorrow that only 
comprehensive and determined air strikes can prevent the Serbs 
from creating a new empire at the costs of the neighboring 
peoples. He will also have to make it clear to the White House 
that the West should by no means again make the mistake it 
committed between 1933 and 1939. If there had been military 
intervention after the occupation of the Rhineland by the 
Germans, World War II would probably never have happened. 
  Bill Clinton still believes that a negotiated solution in 
the 
Balkans is still possible. At least until yesterday he was not 
willing to accept more than half-hearted selective air strikes 
that are doomed to failure from the very beginning. Vranitzky 
will have to convince officials in Washington that a hesitant 
attitude is not useful. Moreover, he will also have to warn 
them against an all too gullible attitude vis-a-vis the 
Russians. Even though Moscow's special envoy Churkin is 
apparently desperate because of the uncompromising position of 
the Serbs, the Russians know that, because of Washington's 
weakness, they have again become a second major partner in the 
world political game from which they seemed excluded until 
recently. In other words: Moscow believes that it can play a 
major role again -- supported by a Washington that proudly 
broadcast a short time ago that it is the only remaining 
superpower. 
  Only when all these lessons are understood will Vranitzky be 
able to present his justified proposal to make Vienna the center 
of Bosnia's reconstruction. First he should try to find out 
whether Washington is really ready to accept as partners the men 
whom it placed on the list of war criminals among great approval 
a short time ago. Yet this may be the U.S. interpretation of 
realpolitik.

<F P=106> [Report by "E.D.": "French Population Remains Critical of </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] One month before the European elections, the French 
population has not turned Europhobic, but it remains very 
critical with respect to European unification. Its opinion, 
gauged through a SOFRES poll in cooperation with regional daily 
newspapers (footnote) (1,000 persons interviewed between 1 and 6 
April 1994), has remained virtually the same since the 
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. Slightly over one-third of 
the respondents (36 percent as compared to 37 percent in 
September 1992) often think of themselves "as a European 
citizens." Although Europe remains an abstract concept, most 
respondents still consider that a hypothetical collapse of the 
European Union would be "serious" (59 percent as compared to 57 
percent in December 1991). 
  The single market is judged harshly: 48 percent think that 
it has "increased" France's economic difficulties over the past 
two years, while only 15 percent consider that it has "reduced" 
them. For the future, although pessimism is less pronounced, it 
remains the dominant feeling: 34 percent think France's 
economic problems will increase in the coming two years, while 
32 percent believe that they will abate. However, there is less 
worry on this count than in 1992. 
  With regard to institutional matters, public opinion prefers 
a confederation. A vast majority (52 percent) favors "close 
cooperation between the national governments within the European 
Council." One-third of the French (36 percent) are in favor of 
"a federal European state whose decisions, when adopted by a 
majority of member states, should be implemented in each 
country."

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Vernet: "Paris-Moscow Tango"] </F>
  [Text] By suggesting to the United States and Russia that 
they should share with the European Union [EU] the chairmanship 
of the international conference on Yugoslavia and by presenting 
a resolution to this end in the Security Council, the French 
Government is remaining faithful to statements which have been 
made with increasing insistence by [Foreign Minister] Alain 
Juppe for several weeks. This is accepting a reality; it is 
also an indirect way of reaffirming Europe's role in an issue in 
which it seemed increasingly marginalized by the American 
initiatives in favor of a Croatian-Muslim federation and by the 
diplomatic activities of the Russian deputy foreign minister. 
Finally, it is the expression of a deep conviction, namely that 
there can be no lasting political solution to the war in the 
former Yugoslavia without the involvement of Washington and 
Moscow alongside the Europeans. 
  With regard to the United States, this stance is not new; 
with regard to Russia, it may seem paradoxical to the extent 
that it is accompanied by a "change," not to say a "hardening," 
of French statements with regard to Boris Yeltsin's government 
and especially its behavior in what [Foreign Minister] Andrey 
Kozyrev likes to call "the near abroad." Is it possible both to 
remind the Russians of the need to respect international rules 
when they intervene in the former Soviet republics, in the 
Caucasus or Tajikistan, and hail as "very positive" the role 
played by the Kremlin in the former Yugoslavia, including the 
unexpected arrival of Russian soldiers in Bosnia? 
  It probably is in the short term. Even if they arrived 
without warning, the Russians came to Sarajevo to support the 
implementation of UN decisions and supported the NATO ultimatum 
to the Serbian forces, willingly or unwillingly. In Krajina, 
Deputy Minister Churkin helped bring about a cease-fire between 
the Croatians and Serbs. He also seemed to be in the best 
position to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to seek an arrangement 
with the Croatian-Muslim federation, despite his apparent 
failure in Gorazde, or perhaps because of that failure, to the 
extent that Radovan Karadzic can come to the negotiating table 
with new trump cards. 
  It is therefore understandable that the French foreign 
minister should welcome Moscow's action. In the medium and long 
terms, however, the situation is less clear. Nothing proves 
that the Russians have the same concept of the Balkans' future 
as the Western countries. It would probably even be tempted to 
think the opposite, if there was any certainty that a clear 
concept existed Europe and the United States. Whatever the 
facts, Russia has returned to the shores of the Adriatic for the 
first time in decades; to think that its Yugoslav policy is part 
of a broader concern about regaining a position as a superpower 
is not to insult it. Their well-cut suits and their impeccable 
English does not alter the fact that the current leaders of 
Russian diplomacy were trained in the Soviet school, brutal but 
effective. 
  Hence the safeguards which Alain Juppe publicly defined in 
his recent statements with regard to Russia and those which are 
being whispered in diplomatic circles. The foreign minister 
pointed out "a resurgence in nationalist spirit" and an 
"undoubted hardening of foreign policy" following the December 
elections. During its interventions in the former USSR, the 
Russian Army must respect the international rules, and those of 
the United Nations and the CSCE; it should not receive 
restrospective clearance for actions decided without 
consultation, nor should it obtain financial support, as Moscow 
is demanding. Russia is no doubt legitimately interested in 
maintaing the stability of its borders, and the Western 
countries, which do not want to send troops to the Caucasus or 
to Central Asia, would show bad grace in systematically 
criticizing the presence of Russian soldiers. Nevertheless, 
Russia should still respect the international community's 
procedures. 
  The Baltic states are a special case; Alain Juppe reaffirmed 
that their territorial integrity should be respected and that 
the Russian Army should pull out of Latvia and Estonia according 
to the timetable set by the agreements, without "conditioning" 
the withdrawal of troops to the status of Russian-speakers 
living in these countries. France quietly regrets the fact that 
its EU partners are not making themselves clear enough on this 
point; when Moscow showed the intention of maintaining military 
bases in Latvia (before attributing this announcement by Boris 
Yeltsin to a "technical error"), Paris suggested that the Twelve 
should protest, but this was not followed. 
  The Europeans, like the Americans, do not really know how 
to react to Russia; they are still afraid of encouraging the 
nationalist tendencies of people like Zhirinovskiy with an 
excessively hard stance, while knowing that the Kremlin is 
taking advantage of this to move its pawns forward. By rash 
statements (relations with the Baltic countries are an "internal 
matter," the Russian defense minister said, for instance) and 
decisions which are annulled if resistance is stronger than 
expected, Russia is destabilizing its neighbors, testing the 
Western countries, and creating faits accomplis. 
  Each advance does not deserve a response in itself, but 
their 
accumulation changes certain situations; this is the technique 
of erosion, which is reminiscent of the "salami tactics" -- one 
slice after another -- used after World War II. In Paris' 
opinion, this new attitude by Russian diplomacy, which Minister 
Kozyrev described in a fictional political scenario back in 
December 1992, should lead Western countries to be more 
vigilant. This does not rule out cooperation with Moscow, quite 
the reverse, nor the continuation of aid given to the political 
reforms and the transition to the market economy. 
  The policy toward Eastern Europe should be twofold: 
association with the EU and the WEU [Western European Union], 
its defense organization, for the states of Central Europe and 
the Baltic Republics which want to become full members of the 
EU; cooperation with Russia, within the scope of the Partnership 
for Peace proposed by NATO and the economic partnership 
agreement currently being negotiated in Brussels. This is on 
the understanding that Moscow cannot be given a right of veto on 
the entry of Central European states into the EU or WEU or a 
special status in all-European organizations (Partnership for 
Peace, CSCE, or Council of Europe), which would amount to 
creating a kind of condominium by the Western countries and 
Russia over the former countries of the Warsaw Pact. 
  Russia wants to be present everywhere but is invoking its 
superpower status to bypass common rules; it is acting in the 
same way with regard to Balladur's stability pact, which was 
accepted by the Twelve: It wants to participate in the Paris 
conference at the end of May, but it would like special 
treatment so as not to be put on the same level as the small 
European states with vulgar quarrels among neighbors. "The 
problems of security and stability in Europe will not be solved 
without Russia's participation," Alain Juppe rightly maintains. 
But great progress is still needed to define clear rules of 
common life, and especially to ensure that they are respected.

    [Editorial Report] 
  An article by commentator Philippe Reinhard in the 30 March 
Paris center-right daily LE QUOTIDIEN "subjectively" rates the 
performance of cabinet ministers one year after the government's 
accession to power. 
  Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe heads the list, with 
18.5 points out of 20, in acknowledgment of the fact he is the 
"best foreign minister of the Fifth Republic," especially 
because of the difficulties the position entails in an era of 
cohabitation, Reinhard notes. In addition, Juppe has deftly 
avoided a clash with both Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and 
Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac. 
  Minister of the Budget Nicolas Sarkozy comes in second, with 
18 points out of 20. While initially lacking experience for the 
job, Sarkozy is now widely praised by his aides. As government 
spokesman, he has succeeded in "announcinge bad news with 
incontestable talent." 
  Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua alse receives 18 points 
out of 20. In Reinhard's view, he has become a "statesman" 
without losing his popularity and has been able to reassure 
those who feared his stance on human rights. The post of prime 
minister is now "within his reach." 
  Reinhard praises Minister of Agriculture Jean Puech, giving 
him 17.5 points out of 20 for his "faultless" course and for 
having contributed to the success of the GATT negotiations. 
  With 17 points out of 20, Minister of Defense Francois 
Leotard, "unconvincing as minister of culture in the past, 
proves there are no desperate cases," Reinhard comments. An 
initially skeptical military now acknowledges him as "the boss." 
He is preparing "solid weapons" for the future. 
  "Rookie" Minister of Health Philippe Douste-Blazy (16.5 
points out of 20) is now a "credible" minister, according to 
Reinhard. A Balladur fan, he has in-depth knowledge of health 
matters and is "decidedly someone to reckon with." 
  Minister of Industry Gerard Longuet receives 15.5 points out 
of 20, because he acted hastily in the Renault-Volvo affair and 
"imprudently" announced the Telecom privatization. However, he 
possesses the great capacity for work and the political sense 
that characterize "great ministers." 
  With 15 points out of 20, Minister of Cooperation and 
Development Michel Roussin is not in an "ideal" post to be 
appreciated by the public, but has managed French relations with 
Africa as best he can. Reinhard notes that the devaluation of 
the franc CFA was carried out in "exemplary" fashion. 
  Minister of Overseas Territories Dominique Perben gets 15 
points out of 20 for defending republican values in territories 
where officials "have a tendency to forget them." 
  Mith 14.5 points out of 20, Minister of Culture Jacques 
Toubon is doing as well as expected considering the popularity 
of his predecessor Jack Lang. 
  Minister of Communication Alain Carignon receives 14.5 
points 
out of 20 for his able management of a ministry "whose necessity 
is not obvious." 
  Minister of Industrial Development Alain Madelin is given 14 
points out of 20 for "hiding in increasingly better fashion the 
fact that he is bored with his ministry." He should be able to 
aspire to a more important post. 
  Minister of Environment Michel Barnier (14 points out of 20) 
"lacks glamor," but is convinced of the importance of his task, 
Reinhard notes, adding that if other ministers were as 
knowledgeable of their duties as Barnier, the government would 
have avoided a number of failures. 
  While Minister of Youth and Sports Michele Alliot-Marie (14 
points), Minister of Regional Development Daniel Hoeffel (13 
points), Minister of Civil Service Andre Rossinot (13 points), 
Minister of Housing Herve de Charette (12.5points), and Minister 
of Relations with the National Assembly Pascal Clement and 
Minister of Relations with the Senate Roger Romani (both get 12 
points) get a fair rating, Minister of Social Affairs Simone 
Veil is only accorded 12 points out of 20. "One can be a `grande 
dame' without necessarily being a great minister," Reinhard 
writes. Despite her possessing the requisite attributes, she has 
been "poorly advised." 
  Minister of Justice Pierre Mehaignerie only rates 11.5 
points. His "extreme prudence" has only "created the impression" 
justice is again independent, Reinhard notes. Mehaignerie uses 
the time he does not devote to his ministry to defend his 
presidency of the Social Democratic Center (CDS). 
  Minister of War Veterans Philippe Mestre (11.5 points) "is 
there because someone has to be," but deserves better, Reinhard 
comments. 
  With only 10.5 point, and cornered by Balladur, Sarkozy and 
Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet, Minister of Finance 
Edmond Alphandery lacks the opportunity to make his talents 
known; "when he did speak, he said too much." 
  Minister of Education Francois Bayrou (9.5 points), "perhaps 
the most intelligent of all," let himself be entrapped by the 
secular education controversy, Reinhard comments, adding he 
hopes that Bayrou's "good ideas" on education will be 
implemented in the future. 
  Minister of Higher Education and Research Francois Fillon 
shares nine points with Minister of Labor Michel Giraud. A 
better interlocutor could have been found for the young rather 
than Fillon, and Giraud has "good will but no luck," according 
to Reinhard. 
  The list ends with Minister of Public Works and Transport 
Bernard Bosson (8.5 points) and Minister of Humanitarian Action 
Lucette Michaux-Chevry (six points).

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Jarreau on "SOFRES" poll conducted for LE </F>
MONDE and RTL] 
  [Excerpts] One year after taking office, the Balladur 
government is still judged relatively favorably by the French: 
32 percent give it a higher rating that its Socialist 
predecessor, which is favored by only 23 percent. However, 
one-third of those questioned (and almost one-half of them if 
the "no opinions" are added) cannot decide or preferred not to 
speak out in favor of either government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, April 20 (AFP) -- The French Government 
decided Wednesday [20 April] to make an exception for the Army 
in its budget economy drive and increase spending on military 
equipment over the next six years. 
  The cabinet agreed to set spending at a total 613 billion 
francs (105.6 billion dollars) for the years 1995 to 2000, an 
"annual increase of 0.5 percent in volume," Government Spokesman 
Nicholas Sarkozy said. 
  This "could go up to 1.5 percent if the economic situation 
permits" when the government's five-year spending plan comes up 
for revision in 1997, he added. 
  According to analysts, state spending in other sectors has 
been cut by around 0.5 percent per year under the plan, launched 
by the centre-right government to contain the public deficit. 
  The defence proposals must still be approved by both houses 
of parliament. 
  The government's priorities are to maintain the nuclear 
deterrent, strengthen conventional forces "to prevent crises and 
contain conflicts, reaffirm the link between defence and the 
nation (through) the national service and maintaining a strong 
arms industry on a European scale," Sarkozy said. 
  The number of people in the Army would come down gradually, 
however, from 606,000 in 1995 to 579,000 in the year 2000, he 
added. 
  Development of the new M5 nuclear missile will also be 
delayed, along with the Rafale combat aircraft, and a 
cost-cutting exercise has begun for the European transport 
helicopter NH-90, a Ministry official said. 
  President Francois Mitterrand made lengthy remarks in the 
cabinet's deliberations, his spokesman Jean Musitelli said 
Wednesday without giving details of his contribution. 
  A well informed source, who did not wish to be identified, 
said Mitterrand had underlined his agreement with the spending 
programme and shown understanding of the financial restraints 
which led to the M5 delay. 
  The share of spending on nuclear weapons will continue to 
fall by about a quarter despite development of a land-based 
version of the M4/M45 nuclear submarine missile, to be used from 
2005 at the ballistic missile base on the Albion plateau in 
south-east France, the Ministry official said. 
  If its European partners agree, the Ministry also plans to 
develop a modular armoured personnel carrier with Germany and 
the new Horizon frigate with Italy and Britain, the official 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pierre Suard, chief executive officer of </F>
Alcatel-Alsthom, by Caroline Monnot on 18 April, place not 
given: "If We Had Expected To Lose Money, We Would Not Have Gone 
Ahead"] 
  [Text] [Monnot] The Koreans have finally chosen the 
GEC-Alsthom consortium for the manufacture of their high-speed 
train. This was a rather bumpy ride. Is the decision final, 
this time? 
  [Suard] It is, as far as we are concerned! We consider the 
decision firm and final. The actual services to be rendered 
have been defined, while the legal aspects remain to be 
finalized. This will be done in the coming weeks. This is an 
extraordinary achievement for French industry! It demonstrates 
that France has a number of technologies -- in this case the TGV 
[high-speed train], but also telecommunications, nuclear 
technologies, satellites -- which place it at the forefront of 
ever fiercer international competition. As for the TGV, I must 
say that this is a success not only for Alcatel-Alsthom, but 
also for the French state and the SNCF [French National Railway 
Company] which initiated this technology 30 years ago. 
  [Monnot] This contract is a real stimulus for the railway 
operation of GEC-Alsthom, one of your subsidiaries. 
  [Suard] Indeed. For GEC-Alsthom and its subcontractors, 
this contract represents four years of work for 800 people. The 
first segment of the Seoul-Taejon line must be ready in late 
1999. The whole line (with its extension to Pusan) must be 
ready by 2001. 
  [Monnot] Last November, Siemens lowered its bid to $2.1 
billion. At the time, GEC-Alsthom, whose 1993 bid was $270 
million higher, had stated that such a price was unreasonable. 
Yet this is the price level at which you closed with Korea. 
  [Suard] Well, we held a number of negotiations. The 
services to be rendered were changed. A larger share of the 
equipment will be manufactured in Korea, which means lower 
costs. The agreement stipulates that out of the 46 trains to be 
supplied to Korea, 12 will be entirely manufactured in France, 
while the balance will be assembled in Korea. Roughly speaking, 
half of this contract's revenues will flow to Korea, and the 
other half to France. In any event, as compared to our bid of 
last year, the expected margin remains the same. 
  [Monnot] You will not lose money at this price level? 
  [Suard] Of course we will not! Had we expected to, we would 
not have gone ahead. 
  [Monnot] The contract also provides for an integral 
technology transfer to Korea. 
  [Suard] The idea is that, by the time the contract has been 
completed, Koreans will be able to manufacture the type of train 
we are selling them today. This only relates to current trains, 
with today's technology. It does not include the next 
generations. 
  [Monnot] Will you get financial backing from the French 
Government? 
  [Suard] No. There will be no funding from the French 
Government. And, I might add, no compensation whatsoever. The 
technology to be transferred is already worth a lot. The Korean 
component of the contract is to be funded locally. As to the 
exported element, it will be funded by banks, including Suez, 
which played an integral part in the negotiation.

<F P=106> [John Carvel report: "Government to Concede to EU on </F>
Part-Time Worker Protection"] 
  [Text] The Government is understood to be preparing to 
compromise with European Union [EU] demands that part-time 
workers in Britain be given better protection. 
  Ministers are still not willing to provoke a Tory rebellion 
by bringing forward social legislation to implement EU proposals. 
  But EU officials suggested last night that Britain will 
shortly respond to a German demand that employment protection no 
longer be limited to those in full-time work. 
  A deal is expected during a German ministerial visit to 
London in the next few weeks. 
  Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the 12 
employment ministers indicated at a council meeting in 
Luxembourg yesterday that this proposal should not be switched 
to the Maastricht social protocol track, which allows the 11 
other member states to proceed without Britain. "The Germans 
said the measure would be a high priority during their EU 
presidency (which starts in July). It requires unanimity in the 
council," Mr Flynn said. 
  He hinted, however, that he may switch two other draft 
directives to the social protocol track to bypass British 
opposition: a statutory right to substantial paternity leave; 
and allowing parents absence from work for family reasons. The 
second would shift the burden of proof in disputed cases in 
favour of the employee. 
  "I must reflect on how to proceed, bearing in mind the 
social 
protocol," Mr Flynn said. 
  He spoke after the first item under the Maastricht protocol 
started its way through the social affairs council. British 
ministers will not be allowed to vote or speak as other member 
state ministers discuss legislation to give multinationals' 
workers the right to consultation on takeovers, redundancies, 
and shifts of production between countries.

<F P=106> [Ian Hamilton Fazey article: "CBI Chief Hints at `Risible' </F>
Euro Laws"] 
  [Text] The Confederation of British Industry [CBI] plans to 
develop a Europe-wide business agenda to unite EU [European 
Union] business leaders in resisting intrusive social 
legislation, Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the 
Confederation of British Industry, said last night. Attacking 
"ill-conceived," "disappointing," and "risible" policies in 
Brussels and among EU member governments, Mr Davies told the 
annual dinner of the Yorkshire and Humberside regional CBI that 
EU legislation on social policy was being brought into disrepute. 
  It was time for the European business community to act in 
its 
common interest and force politicians to take notice. The CBI's 
business agenda would be published next month. 
  Mr Davies said recent "disappointing developments" in Europe 
include: 
  1. EU member governments' discussions of a white paper on 
growth, competitiveness and employment by Mr Jacques Delors, the 
European Commission president, were focusing on new social 
policy initiatives and running counter to the document's 
original themes. 
  2. A green paper on social policy which had focused on ways 
of increasing the cost of employing labour instead of how to get 
Europe's 20 million jobless back to work. 
  3. Failure by the EU and the Council of Ministers to prevent 
a proliferation of state aid for steel, telecommunications 
energy and air travel, putting British companies at a 
disadvantage. 
  4. The failure of the EU to get to grips with its spending. 
Auditors had produced "dismal catalogues of fraud and waste", 
yet the commission took little interest. 
  All large European employers opposed the European Works 
Council Directive -- discussed yesterday by the Council of 
Ministers -- said Mr Davies, because it would cut across 
existing satisfactory consultation arrangements, impose new 
administrative burdens, push up costs and slow down 
decision-making. 
  Britain was not obliged to follow it because of its opt-out 
from the Maastricht social chapter, but 90 UK companies would be 
affected in mainland Europe and the EU was funding a union 
campaign to persuade companies which were not affected by the 
directive to follow it voluntarily. 
  He dismissed the commission's claim that the directive would 
increase identification of employees with their companies and 
increase productivity.

  [Text] Washington (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has indicated the possibility that NATO might extend a 
ban on heavy weapons -- along the line of the Sarajevo model -- 
only to Gorazde and not to all safe areas in Bosnia. "It could 
be that first a decision will be made in connection with 
Gorazde," Kinkel said on Thursday evening [21 April] after talks 
in Washington with his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher and 
U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. 
  In addition, the minister expressed doubts about U.S. ideas 
of tightening sanctions against Serbia. He has "announced 
doubts that we can further tighten the screw," Kinkel said, 
referring to the effects of the sanctions on countries such as 
Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  On Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton had suggested a 
united course against the Bosnian Serbs to bring them back to 
the negotiating table and to save the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. 
The United States wants to win over the Western allies and 
Russia for banning heavy weapons in the surroundings of the 
other five UN safe areas, following the example of Sarajevo. 
Otherwise, the Serbs must expect NATO air raids. 
  Kinkel stressed the "basic agreement" to the U.S. Bosnian 
initiative. In addition to the military plans, it is absolutely 
necessary to push ahead the political process and to include 
Russia. He assessed the Russian suggestion of a summit with 
restraint. Such a conference should be held only if success is 
relatively certain, Kinkel said. 
  Apart from Bosnia, Germany's presidency in the European 
Union, which begins on 1 July, was one of the focal points of 
Kinkel's talks. He announced close cooperation with the 
Americans in the fields of environmental protection, combating 
crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism, as well as disarmament.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government supports U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's attitude in seeking to follow a tougher 
course in Bosnia. On Thursday [21 April], Government Spokesman 
Dieter Vogel stated in Bonn that the continuing aggression by 
Serbian combat troops and their political leaders' constantly 
broken promises grossly violate the basic rules of humanity and 
international law. 
  The military and economic countermeasures mentioned by 
Clinton are part of the options of the allies to bring the 
Bosnian-Serb leadership to its senses. The Federal Government 
calls for close political coordination between the European 
Union, NATO, the United Nations, the United States, and Russia. 
The Federal Government particularly welcomes the intention 
expressed by Clinton for political coordination, above all with 
Russia, to prepare further steps. This is the basic condition 
for clear and consistent action against the forces of 
aggression, Vogel stated.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [20 April] in the 
Bundestag Economic Committee in Bonn, Pakistani Prime Minister 
Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto canvassed for more German economic aid. 
Among other things, she asked for higher Hermes [export credit] 
guarantees to secure private German investments, longer terms 
for certain commodity credits, and more technical aid in 
development cooperation. 
  Benazir Bhutto, who has been in Bonn on an official visit 
since Monday [18 April], promised private investors as much 
protection as possible. The World Bank and the IMF trust 
Pakistan, she said. The reforms initiated by her government -- 
the reduction of debts, the state deficit, and the inflation 
rate -- are showing first signs of success. In the 
modernization of Pakistan, priority is given to agriculture, the 
power supply, development of the infrastructure, and combating 
poverty, she said. 
  According to Bhutto, because of bad harvests as a result of 
disastrous storms and because of the armament efforts forced by 
India, Pakistan is completely dependent on its friends in the 
Western world. In the conflict with India over Kashmir, she 
hopes for the "honest broker services" of friendly states like 
Germany. She affirmed her intention to turn Pakistan into a 
liberal, democratic state oriented to the market economy, one 
that might become a model for the Islamic world -- also 
regarding the situation of women.

  [Text] Hannover, 19 April (MTI) -- Hungary's role at the 
Hannover Industrial Fair forms part of preparations for full 
membership in the European Union (EU), and Hungary welcomes that 
the EU Council today favored its April 1 application, Hungarian 
Prime Minister Peter Boross said, addressing the opening of the 
Fair today. 
  Boross thanked Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, saying that 
his support was instrumental in today's decision. In his 
opening speech, Kohl said that "Europe would be a torso without 
Hungary." 
  Hungary is at this year's Fair as a "partner state", so the 
spotlight is on Hungarian businesses. At the Fair, 123 
Hungarian firms are displaying new products over 1,800 square 
meters. 
  In his speech, Boross emphasized the importance of Germany's 
role in Hungary's foreign trade and business. Last year there 
was 8.4 billion German marks trade with Germany, or 24 percent 
of Hungarian foreign trade. One third of foreign loans to, and 
20 percent of foreign investments in, Hungary come from Germany, 
and there are more than 4,000 Hungarian-German joint ventures, 
Boross said.

  [Excerpts] Hamburg (DPA) -- The criticism of Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and his plans 
to reduce the Bundeswehr to 340,000 [figure as published] men is 
continuing. [passage omitted] 
  The Bundeswehr Association has meanwhile defended Ruehe. 
"Anyone who continues to speak about a troop strength of 
370,000 men without saying at the same time where the additional 
billions are supposed to come from is simply incredible from the 
soldiers' viewpoint," Bundeswehr Association Chairman Bernhard 
Gertz said on Hesse Radio on Wednesday [20 April]. A reduction 
of the Bundeswehr to 340,000 soldiers does not call fairness for 
military service into question. Because of the saving of 1.25 
billion marks, which is necessary on short notice, Ruehe does 
not have any other choice. His concept is the most sensible 
solution, Gertz said. 
  Free Democratic Party Bundestag Deputy Olaf Feldmann came 
out 
in favor of suspending compulsory military service and 
establishing a professional army. The international tasks which 
Germany will be facing require this, he said on Deutschlandfunk 
Radio. Before the Bundeswehr is reduced, its tasks must be 
clearly defined. [passage omitted] 
  Former Fleet Admiral Elmar Schmaehling has noted that 
further 
Bundeswehr missions abroad would logically lead to a 
professional army. "In order to establish crisis reaction 
forces, new volunteers would have to be recruited, who are fully 
supporting the new task." However, in an interview with 
LUEBECKER NACHRICHTEN Schmaehling criticized the "fixation on 
military operations." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Hermann Otto Solms, 
chairman of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] Bundestag Group, the 
reduction of the military service from 12 to 10 months, which 
was proposed by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian 
Democratic Union), is possible. However, before a decision on 
the future troop strength is made, the liberals first want a 
clear definition of the tasks and the organizational and 
equipment structure of the armed forces, Solms said before 
journalists in Bonn on Thursday [21 April]. Ruehe, who is 
striving for a strength of 340,000 to 320,000 men, still has to 
"perform this obligation." 
  Both the chairman of the FDP Bundestag Group and Michael 
Glos, chairman of the Christian Social Union [CSU] Land Group, 
criticized that Ruehe had made his planning proposals and 
savings projects public, without previous coordination in the 
responsible government and party committees. Solms said that 
next Tuesday the plans should first be discussed in the 
coalition round and then in the Cabinet. Ruehe is to develop a 
"proper government bill." 
  The FDP politician stressed the need for savings in the 
Bundeswehr, but he said that one has to stick to the budget 
volume of 47.5 billion German marks for the Hardthoehe. General 
compulsory military service is not at issue for the liberals. 
Glos defended Finance Minister Theo Waigel against the 
criticism that he determines the Bundeswehr's future by his 
savings. In view of the general financial difficulties, 
stricter standards should have been applied to the armed forces, 
Glos said on Suedwestfunk. More striking power can also be 
achieved with a smaller Bundeswehr that is more mobile and 
better equipped. 
  Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
[SPD] Bundestag Group, supported Ruehe's proposals. The 
Bundeswehr's operational capability is currently limited, this 
has to be changed. On the ARD ``Morning Magazine,'' Klose 
advocated a reduction and differentiation of the military 
service. Moreover, the SPD wants a reduction of the armed 
forces to 300,000 men, while it is, however, promised that this 
figure will be maintained for at least 10 years. The Social 
Democrats are also in favor of fixing the current volume of the 
defense budget for four years. In addition, Klose said that he 
is "passionately" against a professional army. This is also in 
line with the SPD decisions.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The criticism of FRG Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and his 
Bundeswehr planning continues. In the BERLINER ZEITUNG 
(Wednesday [20 April] edition), defense experts of CDU and Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] called for the abolition of 
compulsory military service. 
  CDU politician Otto Hauser called for general compulsory 
service for men. In the future, there should be a free choice 
between military service or national alternative service, 
between police and fire brigade, disaster relief and 
environmental service. "Compulsory military service is 
outdated." Anyone who further reduces the Bundeswehr departs 
from the concept of compulsory military service, the defense 
expert said, referring to plans to reduce the Bundeswehr to 
320,000 men. Referring to Ruehe, the CDU politicians said: "I 
have never seen such behavior by a defense minister." One 
cannot push such profound changes in the armed forces through 
parliament in a "mad dash." He thinks the course that has been 
set is substantively wrong. Anyone who serves in the military 
for 10 months is effectively available for only eight months. 
  FDP Politician Juergen Koppelin said that he favors general 
compulsory service for men and women. There is no way to avoid 
an army of volunteers if compulsory military service is 
shortened further. One can hardly find words to describe the 
defense minister's confusion, criticized the FDP politician. 
"Mr. Ruehe finally must present a concept instead of constantly 
manipulating the figures." Compulsory military service of 10 
months would throw the Bundeswehr into organizational chaos.

  [Text] Chemnitz (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], does not expect the 
economic recovery to lead to a reduction of unemployment in 
Germany this year. "I would be satisfied if we managed to stop 
unemployment this year," Kohl said on Wednesday [20 April] night 
at a conference sponsored by FREIE PRESSE in Chemnitz. That was 
all one could expect from the current developments. 
  In his approximately one-hour lecture, Kohl emphasized that 
economic recovery in the new laender had started: "Although the 
flourishing landscapes will not come within four or five years, 
they are on their way," he said. 
  Kohl said that it was a "very tough experience" to see how 
difficult the Germans were finding it to achieve internal unity. 
The chancellor said that people in both east and west obviously 
became more alienated than had been thought.

  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- The Federation of German Industry 
(BDI) expects economic development to revive this year but it 
also expects the number of working people to decline sharply. 
This is said in the economic report of the top association from 
Cologne, published on Wednesday [20 April]. According to the 
BDI's assessment, in the course of the year domestic demand will 
not expand to any degree worth mentioning, but expectations of a 
further speedy improvement in exports are certainly justified. 
  The trend toward a certain increase in stocks, which can be 
seen everywhere now, supports cautious optimism. Prospects for 
a strong stimulation of the economic development, however, 
remain limited. 
  Even if the economic development is favorable, the reduction 
of unemployment in western and eastern Germany will remain "the 
outstanding economic policy problem of the next few years," 
according to the BDI economic report. It is inconceivable that 
this problem will be overcome without a strong increase in 
investment, the report says. 
  According to this top industrial association, the growth 
process in the new laender has accelerated. The increase in 
domestic demand for industrial goods has improved tangibly and 
is spreading to an ever larger number of branches.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federation of German Industrial 
Credit Cooperatives (BVR, Bonn) expects a two in front of the 
decimal point in the inflation rate this May at the latest. 
Import prices as well as industrial producer prices have 
remained almost stable for months, and the pressure of prices in 
services and rents is also declining, the BVR writes in its 
economic report, published on Wednesday [20 April]. As a 
result, the prospects for economic development have further 
improved regarding prices. Since, at the same time, foreign 
orders have increased strongly in the wake of the international 
economic recovery, the BVR expects a slightly increasing output 
for the coming months, even though domestic demand remains 
rather weak. 
  In general, framework conditions for economic recovery have 
improved strongly over the past few months. The revival of the 
international economic development is now also reflected in 
orders received from abroad, which were about 7 percent higher 
during the first two months of this year than a year ago. The 
companies' measures for rationalization and cost reduction are 
beginning to have an effect. 
  The wage negotiations, which have practically been 
concluded, 
will lead to a clear reduction of costs for the companies. The 
development of collective wages and salaries in the most 
important fields amounts to 1.5 percent in gross terms and is 
thus lower than the expected increase in productivity. Improved 
expectations for income and sales have a positive influence on 
investments, in particular since tax conditions have improved as 
a result of the Location Safeguarding Law.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- The Bundesbank has warned federal 
and laender politicians not to increase taxes any further. "The 
tax screw cannot be tightened all the time without putting 
economic growth and stability at risk," the Bundesbank 
economists say in their 1993 annual report. The reintroduction 
of the solidarity tax at the beginning of 1995, the increase in 
mineral oil tax, and the increase in pension insurance 
contributions "will pave the way for a further considerable 
increase in the total tax burden." 
  In view of the high public indebtedness, which, at 1,740 
billion German marks, reached 56 percent of the GDP at the end 
of 1993, the Frankfurt central bank pleaded for more severe 
corrective measures in monetary policy. "An early return to 
sound public finances that bring back the lost breathing space 
for private investors and savers and that are convincing in the 
medium term, could mobilize growth and open up new 
perspectives." The Bundesbank concedes, however, that this 
consolidation process will take several years. 
  The economists at the Bundesbank assess Germany's economic 
recovery somewhat more cautiously than the Federal Government. 
For eastern Germany, the central bank calls for a change in 
wage policy, with lower growth rates. The Bundesbank states 
that "prospects of the German economy have brightened up 
lately." Yet, there is "no clear upward trend in industrial 
production for the first few months of 1994" visible in western 
Germany at the moment. But conditions for a recovery, and thus 
a final defeat of recession, have clearly improved. 
  At the opening of the Hannover Trade Fair on Tuesday [19 
April], Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke of an economic spring when 
he said: "A number of economic figures indicate an upward 
trend." According to the Bundesbank experts, a permanent 
stimulation of exports "has become likely." However, this will 
only happen "if the recovery in the world economy continues and 
western German industry manages further to strengthen its 
competitiveness." The latest wage round settlements are rated 
favorably in this connection. Beside the chemical industry 
compromise with a 1.5-percent wage increase, the metalworkers 
agreement is considered a particularly significant settlement. 
It does not involve any real increase of income for the 
employees, and thus no additional cost for the employers. 
  According to the Bundesbank, "a change in wage policy is 
crucial" for improving competitiveness in eastern Germany. In 
1994 alone, basic wages in the metalworking industry will 
increase by 12 percent over 1993. An end of the catching-up 
process with western German wage standards could contribute a 
great deal to preserving existing jobs and improving the 
opportunities for unemployed people. If the wage policy course 
of adjusting to the western German level continues, the pressure 
to decrease the gap between wages and productivity by means of 
further job cuts will increase.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- 1993 was the year of the money 
forgers. The improving quality of color copying machines has 
led to a surge in the production of counterfeit banknotes. The 
number of forged banknotes registered by the Bundesbank reached 
a total of 41,838, which is three times as much as in 1992, when 
14,057 counterfeit bills were discovered. The value of the 
forged banknotes rose from 2.52 million German marks [DM] to 
5.73 million, the Bundesbank report notes. 
  However, in view of circulating notes and coins worth DM239 
billion by the end of 1993 -- DM224 billion in banknotes -- this 
is a relatively small share. The banknote that was most often 
forged (80 percent) was the DM100 bill. About 60 percent of all 
counterfeit bills were produced on color copying machines. 
  The imitation of DM5-coins no longer seems to be worthwhile. 
The Bundesbank only registered 8,086 forged coins in 1993 
(21,257 in 1992). Their value dropped from DM103,000 to 
DM39,000.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Lebanese terrorist Ali 'Abbas 
Hamadi, who was deported from Germany last year, is reportedly 
back in the FRG. This was learned from security circles on 
Thursday [21 April] morning. According to information that has 
not been officially confirmed, he plans to free his brother 
Muhamad Ali Hamadi, who is serving a life term in the Hesse 
prison of Schwalmstadt for hijacking a plane and killing a U.S. 
soldier. The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations in 
Wiesbaden has not been able to confirm these reports so far. 
  It was also said that this information comes from French 
intelligence service circles. 'Abbas Hamadi is reportedly 
planning an operation to force his brother's release. 
Allegedly, he is in the area of Saarbruecken at the moment. 
  'Abbas Hamadi, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 
1988 for taking hostages and illegal possession of explosives, 
was released from prison last year after having served about 
half of his sentence and was deported from Germany.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- The Duesseldorf police 
president has banned a "demonstration with subsequent children's 
festival" that was planned by Kurds in the North 
Rhine-Westphalian capital for Saturday [23 April]. To justify 
this ban, it was said on Thursday that this event could be 
organized by the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). This, 
however, would be a direct danger to "public order and 
security." A large number of policemen will, if necessary, 
enforce the ban "consistently," it was said. Participants who 
travel to Duesseldorf from outside are to be "caught" when 
entering the city.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`PARIS MATCH -- BVA Opinion Poll: </F>
The Fall of Prime Minister Balladur (Down 9 Percent)"] 
  [Text] The latest "PARIS MATCH -- BVA" opinion poll, 
conducted after the withdrawal of the CIP [youth job training 
contract] but before the suicide of [President's Mitterrand's 
adviser] Francois de Grossouvre, shows a real drop in Edouard 
Balladur's popularity. He has lost 9 percent, posting his worst 
score since he took office. His popularity rating is negative 
for the first time and is now below that of Francois Mitterrand. 
It should be noted that the prime minister's rating has dropped 
considerably (down 15 percent), compared with people with more 
centrist views. The government as a whole has been affected by 
this fall from grace since, also for the first time, the French 
people -- if they were deputies -- would not support the 
government in a confidence vote (49 percent no's as opposed to 
39 percent yes-votes). As a result of this situation, the Left 
has gained 3 percent in legislative election voting intentions. 
The Left-Right balance of power is now 34-44.

  This survey was conducted in a series of one-on-one 
interviews with a representative sample of the French population 
over age 18. The questions for the ratings poll were put to 928 
people between 31 March and 6 April 1994, while 3,747 people 
were asked their general election voting intentions between 15 
March and 18 March 1994, and between 31 March and 6 April 1994. 
Voting intentions were calculated on the basis of people listed 
on the electoral registers. Sampling was done using the quota 
method: sex, age, profession of the head of the household, 
region, and category of town. The results should be seen in the 
light of a margin of error common to all opinion polls and 
related to the size of the sample. These margins of error are: 
more or less one or two points for voting intentions; more or 
less two or three points for overall results; and more or less 
four or five points for the results for the major political 
groups.

  [Editorial Report] Articles reporting on the popularity of 
the government and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur continue to 
appear in the French press. 
<H5>  "Secret" Survey </H5>
  According to Catherine Pegard writing in the 9 April Paris 
weekly LE POINT, a large-scale "secret" survey is being 
conducted nationwide by the Central Office for Polling and 
Statistics on behalf of the Renseignements Generaux (RG) 
following a request by Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua. 
According to Pegard, Balladur is the survey's principal theme. 
Out of 32 questions included in the survey, Pegard cites the 
following: 
  "Do you believe that Edouard Balladur is presently carrying 
out an in-depth course of action aimed at preparing France for 
the future, or a limited course of action aimed at preparing the 
presidential elections?" 
  "Can you tell me if you agree or disagree with the following 
opinions? 
  --"Edouard Balladur's government is right in proceeding 
prudently, for French society is fragile. 
  --"Edouard Balladur's government is carrying out an in-depth 
course of action by preparing the foundation for our country's 
recovery. 
  -- "Sometimes the government meets with obstacles. This was 
to be expected. Everything will be simpler after the 
presidential elections. 
  -- "No other policy but Balladur's is possible. No one could 
do better. 
  --"The government is doing all it can under difficult 
circumstances. One must be patient and trusting. 
  --"The situation is more serious than it is admitted, and 
the 
government has not sufficiently taken into account the realities 
and problems of the French people." 
  According to Pegard, the survey also includes a series of 
questions related to political figures such as Balladur, 
potential presidential candidate Raymond Barre, Rally for the 
Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, Union for French Democracy 
(UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, EU Commission President 
Jacques Delors, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, Minister 
of Interior Charles Pasqua, National Front (FN) leader 
Jean-Marie Le Pen, Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard, 
and President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin. The 
survey seeks to determine the degree of "trust" they inspire in 
solving problems ranging from unemployment to morals, societal 
cohesion, and AIDS. 
<H5>  Poll Results </H5>
  The 7 April Paris weekly PARIS MATCH published the results 
of 
a BVA poll conducted on 18-19 March on behalf of PARIS MATCH, 
France 2, France 3, Europe 1 and the daily newspaper LIBERATION 
among a representative sample of 968 individuals over 18. 
Respondents were asked to answer the following questions: 
  "I will cite the names of the principal ministers in Edouard 
Balladur's government. Can you tell me which are the five 
ministers whose course of action you liked the most in the past 
year?" 
  Some 61 percent chose Charles Pasqua, 45 percent chose 
Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil, 42 percent Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe, 41 percent Minister of Defense 
Francois Leotard, and 25 percent Minister of the Budget Nicolas 
Sarkozy. A number of other ministers obtained scores below 25 
percent. 
  "Out of the following personalities, tell me who, in your 
opinion, would have obtained better results, worse results, or 
results comparable to Balladur's if appointed prime minister." 
  Some 23 percent said Pasqua would have obtained "better 
results," 33 percent "worse results," 41 percent "comparable," 
and 3 percent did not know. 
  Twenty-two percent said Raymond Barre would have obtained 
"better results," 35 percent "worse results," 42 percent 
"comparable," and 1 percent did not know. 
  Fifteen percent said Chirac would have obtained "better 
results," 39 percent "worse results," 44 percent "comparable," 
and 2 percent did not know. 
  Twelve percent said Seguin would have obtain "better 
results," 40 percent "worse results," 41 percent "comparable," 
and 7 percent did not know. 
  Some 11 percent said Valery Giscard d'Estaing would have 
obtained "better results," 53 percent "worse results," 34 
percent "comparable," and 2 percent did not know. 
  "In the next few months, do you want Balladur's government 
to...." 
  Follow the same economic policy: 36 percent 
  Change its economic policy: 61 percent 
  Do not know: 3 percent 
  "With regard to fighting unemployment, when do you think it 
would be possible to determine the success or failure of 
Balladur's policy?" 
  Right now: 14 percent 
  At the end of 1994: 22 percent 
  In March 1995, after two years of government action: 59 
percent 
  Later: 4 percent 
  Do not know: 1 percent.

  [Editorial Report] With the presidential elections barely 
a year away, deputies and potential candidates are thinking only 
of this "polluting" timetable, Philippe Reinhard writes in the 5 
April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. A country that subordinates all 
action to an election in spite of the urgency of existing 
problems is not a "modern democracy," he comments, for its fate 
depends "on a throw of the dice." While the government is 
announcing a significant legislative program, parliamentarians 
will instead devote their time to evaluating the chances of 
various presidential candidates. According to whether they 
follow Prime Minister Edouard Balladur or Rally for the Republic 
(RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, or whether they support French 
Democratic Union (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing or Senate 
President Rene Monory, their conduct will lead to the 
fragmentation of the parliamentary majority, Reinhard contends. 
He warns that parliamentarians ought to let the government 
govern at least until the vote on the 1995 budget, as 
"quarreling in public can only serve the interests of a Left 
whose convalescence is distinctly faster than its adversaries 
seem to think." 
  According to an article in the 6 April satirical Paris 
weekly 
LE CANARD ENCHAINE, Chirac supporters have launched an 
"insidious" campaign by attacking Balladur's physical and 
psychological state, which they contend has deteriorated "now 
that everything is going badly." They are spreading the rumor 
that the "increasingly tired and discouraged" prime minister 
will not complete his term in office. The article cites Eric 
Raoult, one of Balladur's harshest critics and vice president of 
the RPR in the National Assembly, as saying that Balladur "can 
resign on a moment's notice." Chirac supporters also contend 
that were Balladur to leave, Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain 
Juppe would be his likeliest successor, since he maintains good 
relations with President Francois Mitterrand and has no 
presidential ambitions. 
  According to the article, after Alain Juppe's reelection as 
secretary general of the RPR National Council, the defense 
minister presented his activities report, in which he expressed 
satisfaction that the party has become "the most important 
French political force." He then turned to the 1995 presidential 
elections, affirming that the RPR is "loyal to Edouard Balladur 
and faithful to Jacques Chirac" and pointing out that "our party 
possesses all the trump cards to win the presidential elections, 
but the surest way to waste them is to compromise our unity by 
giving in to the delights of clans." For his part, Chirac called 
for "unfailing support" for the prime minister, stating that "I 
would like to tell him in a friendly manner: Do not be alarmed, 
dear Edouard, by the suggestions that members of your majority 
may make to you, for they are dictated only by the desire to 
succeed together." 
  In an interview with National Assembly President Philippe 
Seguin by Frederic Gerschel published in the 14 April Paris 
weekly PARIS MATCH, Seguin was asked whether the government 
would not function more "serenely" if, "rightly or wrongly," 
presidential ambitions were not attributed to Balladur. Seguin 
replied that Balladur himself stated in June 1990 that a prime 
minister who renounces publicly from the outset to run for 
president gains both efficiency and authority. When queried 
whether his favorite candidate for president is still Chirac, 
Seguin pointed out that the problem is less that of candidates, 
of whom "there is a plethora," than of a presidential project, 
of which there is still a distinct lack. The presidential 
election, he added, must be the occasion for a renewed "elan," 
which can only be founded on a clear project. The French people 
will thus base their choice on the quality of the candidate, but 
also on his capability to bring new answers to the present great 
challenges, Seguin concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia/Italy: Andreatta to Kozyrev: </F>
`We Count on Russian Influence'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 18 -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta has today sent an urgent message concerning 
the dramatic events underway in Gorazde to his Russian 
counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, a Farnesina [Foreign Ministry] 
communique said this evening. 
  In the letter, Andreatta recalled recent bilateral 
consultations in Budapest and underscored the urgent need to see 
to it that all the efforts of the entire international community 
converge so as to head off the humanitarian catastrophe that 
United Nations' bodies in Bosnia are warning of. 
  The immediate goal to pursue, he said, was a cease-fire 
coupled with the withdrawal to a sufficient distance of Serbian 
troops from the city of Gorazde. 
  Furthermore, maximum impetus must be given to efforts to get 
negotiations underway lest they lose both their credibility and 
effectiveness, the Italian diplomatic chief continued. 
  The Serbian side, too, should be aware of this and "we count 
heavily on Russian influence to make this happen," Andreatta 
said in the message. 
  At this point, the Italian minister reminded his Russian 
counterpart of Italy's commitment to the search of suitable 
formulas to charge up the process of international 
consultations, starting with the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
"A process which should reflect substantial, decisive 
contributions," and to which the Russian Federation, "with its 
prestige and its political weight", could greatly contribute, he 
said.

  [Editorial Report] The political platforms of Forza 
Italia, the National Alliance, and the Northern League--the 
three parties which together won the national elections held 
27-28 March--can provide some clues on what type of government 
program the coalition is likely to propose. A review of those 
platforms as presented in the press also indicates that several 
fundamental differences in the ideologies of the three parties 
may not only make the formation of a government difficult, but 
also limit its longevity. 
<H5>  Fiscal Policy </H5>
  While all three parties agree that Italy's tremendous budget 
deficit must be reduced, they differ on how this should be 
accomplished. Forza Italia proposes establishing a public debt 
reduction fund and a constitutional guarantee that public 
expenditures will be covered in full. The National Alliance 
proposes reducing the deficit gradually, by reducing the number 
of government securities issued, with the exception of those 
intended to finance public works. It also favors using Treasury 
bonds to pay off the debts of public companies that are slated 
to be dismantled. The Northern League believes the public debt 
should be eliminated altogether, in this way reducing inflation 
and allowing for a monetary policy that would promote 
development. All three believe the personal income tax (IRPEF) 
and corporate income tax (IRPEG) must be reduced, with Forza 
Italia and the Northern League proposing a 30 percent ceiling on 
the IRPEF for everyone, and Forza Italia also proposing that the 
present 200 different taxes be reduced to 10. Both the Northern 
League and Forza Italia advocate "fiscal federalism," giving the 
power to collect all taxes to local agencies. Local agencies 
would in turn give a certain percentage of the collected 
revenues to the central government, or to the "macroregions" 
favored by the League as components of their federalist plan. 
However, the National Alliance proposes instead that a new 
balance be established between taxes for the central government 
and those for the local agencies, with the latter as a 
substitute, not as an addition to the present local taxes. All 
three parties propose a tax rate for each family based on the 
number of dependents, and agree that personal savings and state 
securities should not be taxed. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 22 
March). 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  Forza Italia belives that newly created jobs should not be 
taxed and that a "cushion" should be created between employment 
and unemployment in the form of apprenticeships. The Northern 
League proposes reducing fiscal pressure on employers, 
introducing salary limitations, and flexibility in work 
schedules. The National Alliance is convinced unemployment 
affects the South particularly and therefore asks for a new 
employment policy for that area. It proposes public investments 
in the manufacturing sector and a relaunch of private production 
activity through a resumption of public works. (Milan CORRIERE 
DELLA SERA, 26 March). 
<H5>  Health Insurance </H5>
  Forza Italia proposes that health services be privatized, 
with the state providing coverage only for those persons who 
cannot afford private insurance. In that case, public funds 
would not be disbursed to hospitals, but directly to the 
citizens in the form of nonnegotiable personal coupons to be 
used to purchase private insurance. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 
26 March). The League calls for abolishing mandatory 
participation in the universal health plan and a free choice of 
private insurance coverage, with a mixed public-private system 
that would include free health care to the needy. (Rome IL 
MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance espouses an 
overhaul of current health services to guarantee standardized 
assistance throughout the country. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 
26 March). 
<H5>  Pensions </H5>
  Both Forza Italia and the League have called for a gradual 
move to a private pension system, with the state providing 
pensions for only certain underprivileged categories (Forza 
Italia), and the revision of disability pensions (League). 
According to the National Alliance, everyone is entitled to a 
minimum pension, with those who want and can afford it allowed 
to choose a private pension plan "after they have met their 
obligation to the less fortunate." (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 
26 March). 
<H5>  Institutional Reform </H5>
  Forza Italia proposes the direct election of the president 
of 
the Republic, who would have the power to nominate the prime 
minister and to dissolve both chambers of parliament, in the 
latter case forcing his own resignation. According to this 
proposal, the government would have to receive a vote of 
confidence from parliament in order to avoid dismissal of the 
government and dissolution of the chambers. The League has 
agreed to reform the state without creating the three republics 
it originally proposed. If the reform succeeds in diminishing 
the distance economic and social separation between North and 
South, a "light federalism" will be sufficient, but if a "strong 
federalism" is required, this will be achieved peacefully. 
(Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The federalism proposed 
by the League is based on macroregions and the direct election 
of the prime minister and president of the Republic, who would 
be the guarantor of the national Constitution. (Rome IL 
MESSAGGERO, 27 March). The National Alliance advocates a 
presidential republic and a popular referendum to guarantee 
democracy. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). The Alliance 
also believes in a strong executive, the direct election of the 
prime minister, and further reform of the electoral law. (Rome 
IL MESSAGGERO, 27 March). 
<H5>  Foreign Policy </H5>
  Forza Italia believes the United Nations should be reformed, 
and that Italy's participation should be evaluated based on 
national interests. Italy should continue membership in NATO, 
Forza Italia says, but Italian participation in this 
organization should also be reviewed. It also believes in a 
common European defense system and in maintaining a "highly 
qualified" Italian military. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March). 
The League wants a unified Europe and believes NATO is the only 
viable defense system for Europe until a common European defense 
system is established (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March), but 
calls for greater European presence in NATO. Italy's military 
should include a mix of volunteers and draftees, says the 
League, and conscientious objection should be recognized. The 
League also calls for aid to East Europe and Third World 
countries to encourage local development, and for prohibiting 
the immigration of non-EU [European Union] citizens without work 
contracts. (Milan IL SOLE--24 ORE, 15 March). The National 
Alliance proposes a European seat in NATO and extending NATO 
membership to East European countries. It proposes moving 
towards European unification by annulling the peace treaty of 
1947, while respecting the national diversity of its members. 
The territories of Istria and Dalmatia, the Alliance declares, 
must acquire multiethnic autonomy through new international 
accords. (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA, 26 March). According to 
IL SOLE--24 ORE of 15 March, the National Alliance has a broad 
foreign policy agenda that includes reattaching Istria and 
Dalmatia to Italy, creating employment opportunities in Third 
World countries to stem the tide of non-EU immigrants, rejecting 
the Maastricht Treaty, establishing a European Confederation 
that would promote European nationalism against the United 
States and Russia, and creating a totally professional Italian 
army.

<F P=106> ["I.C." report: "Javier Solana Holds Russia and United </F>
States Responsible for Gorazde's Plight"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
yesterday attributed part of the responsibility for the plight 
of the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, besieged and harried by the 
Bosnian Serb forces, to U.S. and Russian "indiscretions." 
During his appearance before the Congress of Deputies Foreign 
Affairs Committee, Solana recalled NATO's two air strikes 
against the troops besieging the city, but deplored the 
statements by Russian President Boris Yeltsin: "In my opinion, 
his words gave the Serb forces some hope." "Perhaps a permanent 
member of the (UN) Security Council should have weighed his 
words more carefully," because they reduced the effectiveness of 
the NATO action, he added. The minister attributed Yeltsin's 
"mistakes" to factors relating to the domestic policy of Russia, 
a country where nationalist feeling is on the increase. 
  The Russian head of state, who was in Madrid at the 
beginning 
of last week, just after the NATO attack, criticized the use of 
force by the alliance, complained that Moscow had not been 
consulted or even informed, and urged continuing to negotiate. 
  In milder terms, Solana intimated his bewilderment about the 
Clinton administration's recent actions. He recalled that both 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the U.S. chief of 
staff had ruled out strikes against the Serbs hours before they 
finally occurred. "It is true that there were statements -- 
fortunate or otherwise -- which gave cause for the senseless 
Bosnian Serb forces to make decisions (to attack), perhaps 
believing that they were safe because of the international 
community's inaction." 
  As a result of Washington's and Moscow's "indiscretions," 
"the Bosnian Serb forces' position is now a strengthened 
position," the minister stressed, and he warned: "Until the 
international community presents a united front, the Serbs will 
take advantage of any chink." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed SK: "Total Ban on Chemical Weapons -- The </F>
Federal Council Wants To Ratify the International Convention"] 
  [Text] Bern, 20 Apr (ATSA) -- Switzerland should ratify the 
international convention banning chemical weapons and calling 
for their destruction. The Federal Council made this proposal 
to the Assembly in a message that was adopted on Wednesday [13 
April]. The convention is the first disarmament treaty for an 
entire category of mass-destruction weapons. Switzerland has no 
chemical weapons. 
  In January 1993, Switzerland signed the convention that bans 
the design, manufacture, storage, and use of chemical weapons. 
The participating states also pledged never to help anyone 
undertake activities breaking this convention. Besides, all 
existing stocks of chemicals weapons must be destroyed, as well 
as the plants innvolved in the making of such weapons and the 
weapons left by a state on foreign territory. 
  An exhaustive monitoring system -- extended to the civilian 
chemical industry -- will be set up to ensure that the 
convention is complied with. An international organization on 
banning chemical weapons will be established in The Hague to 
carry out this monitoring function. Over 150 states have signed 
the convention up till now, including Switzerland in January 
1993. 
<H5>  No Problem for Switzerland </H5>
  In its message, the Federal Council stressed that 
Switzerland 
itself does not have any mass-destruction weapons. It considers 
that the convention on chemical weapons is, together with the 
nonproliferation treaty, the most important multilateral treaty 
in the security field. The elimination of chemical weapons will 
reduce the risk of a serious military threat. The government 
further says that the destruction of such weapons will have to 
respect the environment. 
  The government underlines that the Swiss chemical industry 
unreservedly adheres to the objectives of the convention. 
Implementing this convention does not require creating new 
institutions or laws, but nevertheless implies considerable 
monitoring activities.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the </F>
Belgian National Bank, by Philippe Engels on 19 April; place not 
given: "Verplaetse: `Belgian Growth of 1.2 or 1.3 percent in 
1994'"] 
  [Excerpts] The Belgian economy is doing better. Slowly and 
quietly. But it is doing better. This improvement is taking 
place in an international environment which has become more 
reassuring in recent weeks. [passage omitted] 
  Unofficially, figures are circulating, mainly for the use of 
political decisionmakers. At the time of the presentation of 
the 1993 annual report of the Belgian National Bank (BNB), [its] 
Governor Alfons Verplaetse cautiously mentioned an increase in 
Belgian GDP of around 1 percent in 1994. Yesterday, at a 
meeting of financiers, Verplaetse said that economic activity 
would produce the same figures as in 1993, "but with the 
opposite sign." This clearly means that after - 1.2 or - 1.3 
percent last year, it will be + 1.2 or + 1.3 percent this 
year. [passage omitted] 
  The important thing is that the recovery movement can now be 
launched, encouraging entrepreneurs and consumers to "liberate 
themselves." 
  Indeed, the improvement is such that some people in the BNB 
are accepting a range of forecasts with an upper limit higher 
than 1.2 or 1.3 percent. According to a generally reliable 
source, one forecast on domestic production goes as high as 1.9 
percent. 
<H5>  No Relapse in Germany </H5>
  Governor Verplaetse, who was the guest at the Financial 
Executives Institute of Belgium meeting yesterday, painted a 
picture of the present state of our economy which could be said 
to be encouraging. One piece of good news with regard to the 
international environment is that the weak recovery taking shape 
in Germany should not collapse. "This is new," Verplaetse said. 
"There will be no `double dip' (new fall in activity -- L'ECHO 
editor's note) as might have been feared." 
  In 1994, growth in Europe will continue to be moderate, 
around 1.5 percent but without any risk of falling back. In the 
rest of the world, aside from Japan, activity is more intense, 
especially in the United States and Canada. The governor of the 
National Bank, in constant contact with his foreign 
counterparts, expects a more uniform growth (in a positive 
direction) in all the industrialized countries in 1995. 
  What about Belgium? This year, exports will do better...but 
imports will also increase. The contribution made by foreign 
trade will therefore not be decisive. The rate of savings will 
fall, after reaching a very high level. Investments should no 
longer decline. 
  "Inflation," Verplaetse said, "will remain moderate `because 
the franc is strong.'" The increase in prices could be limited 
to 2.5 or 3 percent and develop more favorably than in Germany 
or the Netherlands. The minimum estimate (up 2.5 percent) would 
be accomplished if oil prices fall, as expected. Verplaetse 
also announced that there is good news for wage costs: Their 
nominal increase would be 2.5 percent, whereas it was 4.5 
percent in 1993 and would have been around the same without the 
overall plan. The rate would be identical, on average, in our 
three main trade partners (Germany, France, and the 
Netherlands). In terms of competitiveness, that would amount to 
maintaining the status quo. It should be noted that Governor 
Verplaetse estimates the current competitive decrease at 1.5 
percent compared with these three. "Generally, this is not too 
serious," he noted, admitting that this average conceals the 
problems which the sectors exposed to international competition 
may experience. "If there was a major problem of 
competitiveness, Belgium would not have such a current surplus," 
Verplaetse pointed out. In 1993, this surplus is calculated at 
370 billion [currency not specified]. It could increase to 400 
billion [currency not specified] this year. 
  That leaves unemployment and public finances. In June, the 
number of unemployed will still be up compared with the same 
month of 1993, the governor warned. With regard to this figure, 
however, there is reason to hope that the increase will stop at 
the beginning of next year. As for public finances, they seem 
to be under control...at the level of the federal budget (the 
first three months of the year were good) and social security 
"will do better than in 1993." The communities and regions, 
however, will not honor in 1994 the objectives assigned to them 
by the Higher Council of Finances; and "it will be too late to 
do anything about it," Verplaetse remarked. 
  Will the convergence plan which has been amended (in March) 
be respected? The governor of the National Bank refused to 
commit himself. But, in 1995 and 1996, he thinks that Belgium 
will be "more or less in order." With regard to the monetary 
sphere, we are also still on course, with "the system currently 
in force in Europe working well for the time being." 
Verplaetse's conclusion with a view to the decisive phase of 
economic and monetary unification is: "I am still convinced that 
Belgium will be able to join the front runners."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flemings Would Rather Get Rid of </F>
Belgium"] 
  [Text] A poll conducted by political scientists and 
sociologists from Louvain revealed that 10.8 percent of the 
Flemings tend toward separatism, while 44 percent are "Belgian 
nationalists" or "hesitantly Belgians." 
  The demand to split up social security is supported by some 
40 percent of the Flemings. This was published by CAMPUSKRANT, 
the magazine of the Catholic University of Louvain (KUL). The 
poll results are based on interviews carried out in early 1992 
among 2,691 Flemings. Based on this poll, the researchers Bart 
Maddens, Roeland Beerten, and Jaak Billiet describe 30.8 percent 
of the Flemings as "Belgian nationalists," 10.8 percent as 
"Flemish nationalists," and 32.8 percent as "regionalists." The 
latter identify with Flanders but are not anti-Belgium. Among 
the respondents, 13.2 percent are "hesitantly Belgians." They 
are very Belgium-minded, except when it comes to social 
security. An opposite attitude is found among the "hesitant 
regionalists" (12.5 percent). A remarkable phenomenon is that 
one-third of the voters whose party preference goes to the 
Vlaams Blok [Flemish Bloc], are "Belgian nationalists" and 
"hesitant Belgians." The Volksunie [The People's Union] has the 
highest percentage (71.3 percent) of "Flemish nationalists" and 
"regionalists." Most of the "Belgian nationalists" are found in 
the SP [Socialist Party] (38.9 percent), followed by Agalev 
[Green Party] (34.9 percent), and the CVP [Christian People's 
Party] (32.4 percent). Pro-Flemish people are found more among 
highly educated and less among noneducated people. 
  The "Belgian nationalists" attach much less importance to 
community problems than others and consequently form a silent 
majority. "As is often the case, we are dealing with a fervent 
minority, whose ideas get the most response from politicians and 
in the media," Billiet concludes.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dirk Achten: "Small and Mobile"] </F>
  [Text] There will be no new Belgian UN troops in the coming 
months. If UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali needs 
troops again soon for anywhere, for example Bosnia, then the 
defense minister will politely request that he look elsewhere. 
The enthusiasm in the Army for UN operations is at an absolute 
low. Just as the prestige of the United Nations itself is 
declining at a rapid rate. 
  Things sometimes turn out strangely. It was these very UN 
operations which were to have given the reformed Belgian 
professional Army the opportunity to demonstrate its usefulness. 
It now appears that these UN activities are not as innocent as 
they seem and that the world is more gruesome, cruel, and 
dangerous than people liked to think at one time. 
  Therefore, there will be no new UN adventures, at least not 
in the near future, in order to have some time to recover. That 
is wise and logical. Also because a de facto full military base 
remains in Kenya, should the situation in Burundi also 
completely derail. In the meantime, the costs are mounting up. 
Soon we will be talking about 1 billion [Belgian francs] or 
more. Those calling for a permanent and strong military 
presence in Central Africa would do well to make these financial 
calculations as well. Can the Belgian Government, very short of 
money, find this amount every year? 
  The enormous evacuation operation from Rwanda was a success, 
not only due to the deployment of the paratroopers, but also 
thanks to many other soldiers. The Army worked and achieved 
very respectable results. That is not as self-evident as it 
appears. Many people, including MP's, believe that in order to 
solve matters quickly it is enough to call out the Army, 
drastically reduced in size and continually subjected to rounds 
of cuts. 
  It is not that simple and that is why the Rwandan operation 
was an outstanding performance. The military also had enough 
sense to not deal with the media as troublesome insects so that 
the Rwandan operation received extensive attention. Attention 
which the Army can well use in these uncertain times. 
  Because with the abolition of obligatory national service, 
with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, armed forces, even on a 
small scale, are no longer really necessary in the eyes of many 
people, including MP's. Moreover, defense always emerges as an 
opportunity to save money while the same people find it simply 
normal that the army is able to intervene in unexpected crisis 
situations as a perfectly oiled and trained machine. Something 
is wrong here. 
  Of course, money can be saved in the defense budget. It is 
rather obvious that the times of the Cold War are behind us. 
But even the little army which remains demands some attention 
if it is to maintain a minimum of usefulness. The soldiers who 
went to Rwanda did not go with the best equipment, modern 
facilities, and in optimum condition. In some cases, it was 
about making do. And that brings risks. 
  A small, mobile, and deployable professional army is 
affordable but not completely free of charge. Transport, 
effective weaponry, appropriate personal equipment, logistics, 
modern radio equipment, and training are required. The 
operation in Rwanda once again made it clear what the 
considerably reduced army needs most to be able to do what is 
asked of it. And that is not the very latest fighter aircraft.

<F P=106> [Satellite interview with Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans </F>
in The Hague by anchorman Henny Stoel in the studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Stoel] Good evening Mr. Kooijmans 
  [Kooijmans] Good evening Henny Stoel. 
  [Stoel] NATO has finally decided to issue a new ultimatum to 
the Serbs and to carry out air strikes if necessary. Are you 
satisfied with this decision? 
  [Kooijmans] Yes, I am. It is clear that the UN Security 
Council has decided that the Serbs must leave Gorazde and that 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops should deploy in the town. 
The ultimatum has been set for Sunday evening at 03OO. 
  [Stoel] Are the Serbs to be fought from the air? Should the 
fighting not take place on the ground, as advocated by Minister 
[Jan] Pronk? 
  [Kooijmans] At this time, that is absolutely impossible. In 
any case, according to the military, an airborne strike force 
could be used, and they [the Serbs] must take the credibility of 
this threat into account. 
  [Stoel] What about the security of the UN ground troops? 
U.S. Senator Nunn, a very influential man, advocates evacuating 
the UN troops first before launching air strikes. Would you 
agree to this, too? 
  [Kooijmans] Certainly not. This would be totally 
inconsistent with what has been decided by the Security Council; 
namely, that the UN troops absolutely should be stationed in 
Gorazde. This is the assurance that can be given to the safe 
areas and, therefore, there should not be any withdrawal. 
  [Stoel] But the UN ground troops will be in danger? 
  [Kooijmans] Necessary measures must be taken and some have 
been taken to ensure their safety as much as possible. 
  [Stoel] What kind of measures? 
  [Kooijmans] I cannot provide any information on that. 
  [Stoel] They are secret? 
  [Kooijmans] Those measures are confidential. 
  [Stoel] Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton want to organize a 
summit on Bosnia. Does this still make sense? 
  [Kooijmans] Yes, but do not forget that this is only to 
prevent Gorazde from being taken over completely. A political 
solution must also be reached and it is therefore very important 
that the different parties involved in the negotiations 
intervene. This is being contemplated in the form of a 
conference with all parties involved directly -- the United 
States, Russia, European Union, and the United Nations. 
  [Stoel] Thank you, Mr. Kooijmans 
  [Kooijmans] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "People's Party for Freedom and </F>
Democracy Leader Bolkestein Wants To Be Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] It seems after all that VVD [People's Party for 
Freedom and Democracy] leader Bolkestein is ready to take on the 
job of prime minister if the liberals are the largest party 
following the elections. 
  Bolkestein believes that the political leader of a party 
must 
not shirk the responsibility of leading a government. 
  Four days ago, Bolkestein stated that he attached more 
importance to membership in the Chamber than holding ministerial 
or prime ministerial office. 
  At a meeting in Alphen aan den Rijn, he stated yesterday 
evening that the VVD would not be bringing "any issues that can 
not be negotiated" into the formation of a new government. The 
VVD is seeking cutbacks of 17 billion guilders during the next 
term of government. If it is less than 15 billion, Bolkestein 
states that the VVD would withdraw its support.

<F P=106> [Report signed K.V.: "Brinkman Down, Deetman Up"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Things are going well for [Second Chamber 
Speaker] Wim Deetman. As things get worse for Elco Brinkman 
[Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) leader], the Chamber 
speaker's star is shining brighter. Rumors in The Hague suggest 
that he may soon become floor leader of the CDA or even end up 
as prime minister. 
  Until recently, Deetman responded to such speculation with 
declarations of love for his present job of Chamber speaker. 
This has changed two weeks before the elections. Last weekend 
he declared that "I will not run away from my responsibilities" 
if the party gives him the job of floor leader. In this week's 
VRIJ NEDERLAND, he did not even shy away from the high office of 
prime minister. As a good CDA man, he said that this would 
depend on consultations with the "home front," i.e., his wife 
and children. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jose Smits: "`Purple' Coalition Will Demand </F>
Sacrifices From People's Party for Freedom and Democracy in 
Particular"] 
  [Text] A "purple" coalition involving the PvdA [Labor 
Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and 
the D66 [Democrats 66], possibly supplemented by the GroenLinks 
[Green Left], could become stuck on their respective views about 
the future of social security. Nevertheless, as if the 
elections have already been concluded, open negotiations are now 
taking place to reconcile the extreme positions. 
Hans Van Mierlo, D66 leader, sees great chances for success if 
all the parties are simply willing to compromise. He is asking 
a lot, because the various positions, as they stand in the 
electoral platforms, are far apart. 
  One point which stands out is the VVD's desire to introduce 
a 
basic system. That would mean that all social security benefits 
apart from the AOW [General Pensions Law] would be reduced to 60 
percent of the minimum wage. The D66 wants the partial 
abolition of the WAO [Law on Labor Disability]. The Green Left 
wants to increase minimum social security benefits and the WAO 
by 10 percent. Even if this radical party is excluded from a 
"purple" coalition, the PvdA remains a stumbling block because 
it wants to leave the WAO untouched. 
  However, anyone who wanted to pin a party down to its 
electoral platform promises would be naive. The programs are 
written to make differences clear to voters. They say less 
about what a party is willing to sacrifice of its own ideals, if 
it is able to realize part of its program by taking part in 
government. 
  There is also agreement on some points. For example the VVD, 
the D66, the PvdA, and the Green Left all want a sharper 
selection procedure in allocating social security. The Green 
Left and the D66 want to abolish the WAO for people partially 
incapacitated for work on the assumption that they will continue 
to work for their company. The VVD wants to abolish the WAO for 
people who have not had five years of paid work. 
  The D66, the PvdA, and the VVD want stricter WW 
[Unemployment 
Law] criteria. The PvdA wants to abolish the WW for unemployed 
people who were employed for a short time only. The VVD and the 
D66 want no WW for people who resign of their own accord or 
refuse suitable work. 
  It appears that all four would also be able to quickly reach 
agreement about the Sickness Insurance Act. The D66, the VVD, 
and the Green Left favor the abolition of the Act, subject to 
the condition that employers are obliged to pay part of the 
wages of their sick employees. The PvdA has said nothing about 
this point, therefore has not said it is against it. 
  The VVD's wish to reduce all social security benefits for 
new 
cases to 60 percent of the minimum wage appears to be the big 
problem in the formation of a "purple" cabinet. That is 1,029 
guilders per month. For an average employee who is made 
redundant or becomes unable to work, that would mean halving his 
current social security benefit. 
  The VVD also understands that things cannot suddenly change 
just like that. The party is assuming that every employee will 
take out additional private insurance. Employees themselves 
will decide the size of their premiums and the extent of their 
security. 
  Officially, the D66 and the PvdA see little in this 
additional insurance system. It encroaches on solidarity, among 
other reasons because private insurers will not accept providing 
additional insurance to all employees. Nevertheless the D66 and 
even the PvdA are calling for more freedom of individual choice 
within the social security system. In addition, last year the 
PvdA agreed on a reduction in WAO benefits with the argument 
that employees could take out additional insurance. 
  It is generally recognized that it is difficult for 
employees 
to insure themselves against the financial consequences of 
redundancy. In order to be completely sure, the PvdA recently 
made enquiries at private insurers. They all said that the risk 
of redundancy was too uncertain and extremely expensive in times 
of increasing unemployment. But it does not all have to come 
from insurers. Employers already tend to supplement the WW 
payments of redundant employees. 
  It will be the VVD in particular which will have to swallow 
its own wishes in the formation of a "purple" coalition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "More Undecided Voters Than Ever"] </F>
  [Text] There are now more voters who are undecided about 
which party to vote for than ever before. As many as 26 percent 
of voters do not know which party they will vote for on 3 May. 
Even more voters (29 percent) have recently changed their minds 
on how they will vote. 
  These are the findings of the NSS survey bureau in The 
Hague. 
The survey bureau attributes the high percentage of undecided 
voters to great restlessness and uncertainty among voters. At 
present, it is the Center Democrats (and CP86 [Central Party 
86]) and the Elderly People's Party which are benefitting most 
from this uncertainty. The latest opinion poll conducted by NSS 
gives them respectively, six and five seats . 
  According to the bureau in The Hague, the main reasons why 
people are switching parties are the reports and developments 
regarding social security and problems concerning foreigners and 
asylum-seekers. 
  The PvdA [Labor Party] can expect 33 seats, the CDA 
[Christian Democrat Party], and the D66 [Democrats 66] 28 seats 
each, while the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
could grow to 27 representatives, the NSS poll indicates.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Unemployment Rising Faster Than </F>
Ever To Over 500,000"] 
  [Text] Unemployment is rising faster than ever before, with 
18,000 jobs lost every month. Such a rate of increase is the 
highest since the war. 
  This is clear from the latest unemployment figures published 
by the CBS [Central Statistics Office]. It is also the first 
time that unemployment has topped the half million mark since 
early 1986. 
  In an initial reaction to the figures, Social Affairs 
Minister De Vries spoke of an "alarming growth." "Strictly 
speaking, we are now facing an increase of 200,000 a year. It 
is clear that although there is already some prospect of 
economic recovery, the process of reducing jobs is still 
continuing steadily and the end is not yet in sight," the 
minister said. 
  De Vries believes that the new unemployment figures stress 
the need to lighten the costs burden on companies and for a more 
flexible labor market. "Also, employers and employees should 
exercise the greatest constraint not only in the current round 
of wage negotiations for this year, but also for 1995," De 
Vries stated.

  [Text] Britain is withdrawing a number of staff from its 
embassy in Belgrade, capital of the war-torn former Yugoslavia, 
the Foreign Office confirmed tonight. 
  Dependents of embassy officials and other non-essential 
members of staff will leave as "a sensible precaution," a 
spokesman said. 
  "The embassy will remain open, but operating at a reduced 
level," he added. 
  The embassy was also reported to be contacting all British 
and Commonwealth nationals registered with it. "If anyone wants 
to leave at the same time they can come with our convoy," First 
Secretary David Campbell told REUTERS in Belgrade. 
  The Foreign Office said the withdrawal of personnel was "a 
sensible precaution because of increased tension". 
  There are 11 British diplomats at the Belgrade embassy, 
which 
will remain open but probably with a reduced number of staff. 
  The evacuees, expected to number less than 20, will leave by 
road convoy -- possibly tomorrow. 
  Elsewhere in Belgrade there are about 60 other British 
residents, most of them journalists or married to local people. 
  The Foreign Office issued advice some time ago for British 
nationals to leave the city.

<F P=106> [By Finlay Marshall, PRESS ASSOCIATION news correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The threat to Bosnian Serb forces from NATO 
warplanes could extend to strikes on roads, bridge and power 
stations in all areas controlled by them. 
  Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Armitage, former commandant of 
the Royal College for Defence Studies who was also head of 
Defence Intelligence, said NATO had three options: 

  -  They 
could continue combat air support attacks in support of United 
Nations troops on the ground 
  -  Within the three kilometre 
withdrawal zone ordered by Manfred Woerner, Secretary General of 
NATO, aircraft could attack ammunition dumps, local headquarters 
and tank emplacements 
  -  Under the UN Resolution 834, the war could 
be extended beyond the Gorazde area to include power stations, 
bridges and roads, destroying the country's infrastructure. 
  Sir Michael said: ``We must have gathered sufficient 
intelligence by now to know where their supply dumps are and 
they could be clobbered within a three kilometre area. Under 
the first option it is very difficult for air attacks to succeed 
where UN troops may have been ambushed. You can't do it. 
  ``The third thing we could do is extend the war into Serbia. 
We could bring down bridges and put out the lights in Belgrade, 
destroy rail links and roads. You would have to warn them in 
advance that is what we were going to do but it would be pretty 
serious and make their eyes water. 
  ``The situation there is very dirty indeed. Some of the 
Serbian commanders may be out of control fighting a war of their 
own and they are making us look silly. The Serbian leadership 
is playing games with us. Air power alone will not succeed 
there.'' 
  Sir Michael said he had met the British UN commander, Lt 
General Sir Michael Rose, and admired him as a soldier who 
needed to be backed by his commanders and given the extra troops 
he required to hold safe havens. 
  He said: "If General Rose says he needs 8,000 troops he 
should be given them. But on no account should the United 
Nations contemplate major operations out there. We are being 
made fools of by the Serbians every day. I have lost count of 
the number of ceasefires there have been. Even the Russians 
have given up on them."

<F P=106> [Robert Fox article: "NATO Must Not Reinforce Failure of </F>
Fantasy Policies"] 
  [Text] As NATO considers today the widening of air strikes 
against Serb forces in Bosnia, the generals and diplomats might 
ponder the comments made in June 1944 by Air Marshal Sir John 
Slessor, the RAF C-in-C in Italy, on the limitations of airpower. 
  "It cannot by itself," he wrote to Gen George Marshall, 
"defeat a highly organised and disciplined army, even when that 
army is virtually without air support of its own." 
  NATO commanders might come to a similar conclusion about the 
chances of bombing the Bosnian Serb fighters into desisting from 
attacking. 
  The chances of NATO aircraft being able to pick out 
well-prepared gun positions and supply dumps are limited, 
judging by the record of the air strikes on Gorazde. 
  Widening the area of attack to Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica 
is likely to lead to further bloodletting and revenge on the 
thousands of refugees trapped there. 
  It will also render the task of UN troops and international 
aid operations impossible. 
  "It is like being half pregnant," said the first UN 
commander 
in Bosnia, Major Gen Lewis MacKenzie. 
  "You cannot have a UN force on the ground which is half 
humanitarian, half interventionist." 
  Gen MacKenzie said he hoped the debacle of Gorazde "would 
pour a bucketful of cold water over the UN Security Council," 
encouraging its members to pass resolutions for policies which 
were feasible, and which its member governments were prepared to 
support. 
  The notion of the Muslim safe areas was a policy always 
waiting to be exposed, according to some in the military. 
  "It was a wheeze dreamed up by the Americans with the French 
without the slightest notion how this was to be implemented on 
the ground," said a British officer this week. 
  While NATO shifts and muddles through the arguments for air 
attacks to protect the Muslim enclaves, the Serbs appear to have 
shifted the agenda and appear to be coming to one of the main 
items on the programme. 
  As the butchery of civilians continued inside Gorazde, 
Bosnian Serb forces were reported yesterday to be renewing their 
offensive on the corridor in the north and east of Bosnia 
between Brcko and Doboj, connecting Serbia with Serb-held areas 
in northern Bosnia and Croatia. 
  The Serb forces -- and now analysts make little 
differentiation between those in Bosnia and those based over the 
border in Serbia -- seem bent on fulfilling the forging of 
Greater Serbia. This would cover a huge arc of Bosnia; and 
perhaps stretches of the Dalmatian coast. 
  The new Serb offensive threatens a war spreading to Croatia 
and with Muslims and Albanian nationalists in Macedonia and 
Kosovo -- the wider war in southern Europe. 
  Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, the U.S. Secretary of 
State, warned of just such a scenario. 
  Moscow's proposal for a summit to discuss stopping Serb 
aggression should be taken seriously -- because it is based less 
on self-promotion, too often the vice of the West European and 
American leadership, than fear. 
  More Serb conquests would mean more Muslim refugees with 
nowhere to go. The Muslim cause in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania and 
Macedonia, would become an emblem of the new European anarchy. 
  The Russians fear their battle will be taken up by the 
Muslim 
peoples on their southern borders, abetted by weapons, money and 
terrorist training from Iran, Pakistan, and North Africa. 
  Faced with such consequences, European soldiers and 
diplomats 
are worried about the half-hearted gestures at policy from 
America, a reflection of the weakness of the Clinton team. 
  The bloodbath of Gorazde shows that the time for quick-fix 
policies is over. 
  The UN cannot get out, nor can the Bosnian Muslims forces be 
armed -- both will take too long, and both risk further disaster. 
  The NATO delegates deliberating today must allow themselves 
space to devise real policies they can deliver. They must avoid 
reinforcing the failure of fantasy policies such as protected 
Muslim safe havens.

that the Richard Nixon played in ending the Cold War between 
East and West. 
  In a message to President Bill Clinton, John Major said he 
had heard "with sadness" the news of the former president's 
death. "I send to you and to the American people my sympathy 
and condolences," he said. 
  "Richard Nixon will be remembered for his tireless work for 
a 
better understanding between East and West. He was a leading 
architect of the process which led to the end of the Cold War 
and his judgment on international affairs was widely respected. 
He will be greatly missed by his many friends and admirers on 
this side of the Atlantic." 
  Contents of the message were released by the Foreign Office.

<F P=106> [Article by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke: </F>
"Proof That I Was Right"] 
  [Text] I hope this is not going to be too difficult a month 
for all of us taxpayers. But today I am even more convinced 
that I was right to raise taxes in my 1993 Budget. Of course 
the last thing I ever expected to have to do as a Conservative 
Chancellor was to raise taxes. It pains a Conservative to have 
to raise taxes just as surely as cutting public spending goes 
against the grain for the Labour party. 
  But I have never said or believed that a Conservative 
government should never raise taxes. I am committed to the 
belief that the burden of taxation in Britain should be as light 
as possible, consistent with the delivery of good public 
services and the maintenance of sound public finance. When we 
can afford to lower taxes we have always done so and will always 
do so, but that must be as and when the economy can afford it. 
  Last year we were faced with a deficit which represented 
nearly 8 per cent of Gross Domestic Product [GDP]. The 
Government was borrowing at the rate of nearly 1 billion pounds 
for every week of the year. I had not the slightest doubt that 
my first priority as Chancellor was to continue the good work 
begun by my predecessor Norman Lamont and to get rid of the 
borrowing problem both in the short and the long term. It was 
vitally necessary to raise taxes and reduce public spending to 
get the public finances under control once and for all. Nothing 
has emerged since that has made me think that there was any 
sensible alternative . 
  The Government has been through all this before and not so 
long ago. The huge legacy of debt left by the 1974-79 Labour 
government, together with the effects of the last recession, 
obliged Geoffrey Howe to raise taxes substantially in the 1981 
Budget. The Howe increases in tax at that time raised about 2 
per cent of GDP. Introducing a tax-raising Budget on this scale 
in the depth of recession was fiercely controversial. At the 
time it provoked considerable discontent among backbenchers. 
Rumours of Cabinet resignations were rife. A letter of protest 
delivered to THE TIMES by 364 leading economists claimed that 
the Government's economic policy was well on the way to ruins. 
  The belated flap about my 1993 Budget over the past month or 
two was slight compared with the panic over Geoffrey's in 1981. 
That 1981 Budget established a stable economic framework as a 
prelude to more than eight years of economic growth. Of course 
there are differences and history must never be trusted to 
repeat itself. But my judgement is that the tough decisions I 
took on tax and spending in the winter last year give us the 
chance of several years of steady growth, prosperity and secure 
jobs. 
  When I go abroad I find that people are highly optimistic 
about Britain's economic position and our prospects. At home, 
everything we hear and read is riddled with gloom and pessimism. 
We are in danger of talking ourselves into a ridiculous 
despondency. 
  My job now is to stick to sound economic policies which will 
promote that growth, that prosperity and those jobs. I have got 
our budget deficit under control. Now we must establish a 
culture of lasting price stability. We are determined to get on 
top of inflation once and for all and we are succeeding. 
Inflation has been below 3 per cent for the past 16 months. At 
2.3 percent today it is as good or better a rate than is enjoyed 
by most of our European competitors. Interest rates are down 
dramatically and are among the lowest in Europe. 
  Tough economic policies and stable conditions enable us to 
resume the task of turning Britain into a competitive and 
enterprising industrial country. We achieved a genuine economic 
transformation of the country in the 1980s with supply side 
changes that revived the entrepreneurial flair of our people. 
We can now boast that there are 600,000 more small businesses 
in Britain than there were in 1979 despite the recession. 
  Our productivity, which was pathetic in the past compared to 
our competitors, has improved dramatically and is still 
improving. The number of cars built per production worker at 
Cowley has risen from 10.4 in 1991 to 34 this year. At the most 
modern comparable car plant in Germany the figure last year was 
30.8. 
  Low inflation and increased competition has ensured a 
remarkable decline in some prices. Since the autumn, price wars 
in food retailing have benefited the consumer enormously and one 
supermarket chain announced this month that it was reducing one 
in 10 of its key brands by up to 15 per cent. Fuel prices are 
down and declining. Since privatisation domestic gas prices have 
fallen in real terms by 23 per cent and industrial gas by 30 per 
cent. Electricity prices have fallen by 6 per cent in real 
terms in the past two years alone. 
  Confidence is growing and independent forecasters underline 
future expectations. The latest surveys by Dun and Bradstreet 
and by the CBI [Confederation of British Industry] point to 
further evidence that the economy is recovering decisively. 
They show that sales orders, employment and profits are at 
their highest levels since 1989. All regions and sectors are 
reporting a rise in orders and in employment expectations. 
Construction too has shown a particularly marked increase in 
optimism with sharp rises in activity. As a result house prices 
are recovering. 
  This change is not some preordained swing in the economic 
cycle. It would not have occurred if we had a Labour or a 
Liberal government. One of the most important decisions I have 
taken over the past year has been to ignore the advice of Gordon 
Brown. If I had lowered interest rates in the way he has 
suggested over the past few months we would have put much of our 
gains at risk. Inflationary expectation would have been 
rekindled. If I had not tackled the deficit, that would almost 
certainly have been accompanied by a crisis of confidence in 
sterling. Interest rates would have had to rise. 
  In the late 1970's Labour invented "stagflation" and 
trapped the British economy in a cycle of low growth, high 
inflation and high interest rates. The supposedly reconstructed 
Labour party would do the same today. Labour would have 
introduced the minimum wage and adopted the European Social 
Chapter. The consequence of introducing these would have meant 
that unemployment would be rising today rather than falling. 
  There is still a genuine political divide on the economy. In 
the longer term it remains a divide between a Conservative party 
with low-spending, low-tax instincts and Labour and Liberals 
with high-spending, high-tax habits. But here and now it is a 
sharp divide over the day-to-day handling of interest rates, 
tax, borrowing and public spending. That debate should be 
resolved by the effects of my choices on the real economy. We 
have a good way to go yet before we have growth that is strong 
enough without turning into boom. But I remain sure we are 
heading that way. 
  I have no doubt that overall confidence is growing and that 
the recovery is being sustained. What is more, the major 
European economies so vital to our long-term prosperity are 
beginning to see the bottom of recession. France is 
experiencing some growth and Germany will do so in the 
not-too-distant future. 
  For nearly two years our national income has been rising and 
the latest forecasts from both the EC Commission and the OECD 
suggest that Britain will have the fastest growth among major EC 
countries in both 1994 and 1995. Let us celebrate some good 
news for once. Let us also stick to tough, prudent policies such 
as the tax rises and the spending cuts in my Budget that are 
delivering good news.

  [Text] Hans Modrow, deputy of the the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS], has been expelled from the German delegation to 
monitor the elections in South Africa. 
  Bundestag President Suessmuth today called on the party to 
nominate a different deputy. Modrow's participation in the 
mission is not in the interest of the parliament because he is 
being accused of electoral fraud during the GDR era. 
  In a meeting earlier of the Council of Elders, all other 
parties came out against Modrow. The PDS is considering taking 
legal action against the decision by the Bundestag president.

<F P=106> ["he" report: "Bundesbank Does Not See Any Way To Arrive at </F>
Narrower Exchange Rate Fluctuation Ranges Right Now"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Apart from the targets of the 
planned monetary union, the Bundesbank wants a harmonization of 
the different "financial cultures" in Europe. It expresses 
skepticism about the speed and progress on the path toward the 
targets. It says that the prior return of the European 
currencies to narrow fluctuation ranges, which were broken down 
in mid-1993 in the course of speculation waves, would be 
superfluous. 
  In its business report the Bundesbank once again deals with 
the European Monetary system (EMS) crisis, which was mastered by 
considerably expanding the fluctuation ranges in the summer of 
1993. It calls this solution an "idea that has been advocated by 
the Bundesbank in principle in internal discussions for some 
time." As advantages of this regulation the Bundesbank cites 
the isolation of hard-currency countries from a disturbing 
influx of money and the discouragement of currency speculation. 
The relatively wide fluctuation ranges were determined by those 
countries who want to avoid excessive intervention debts if 
possible in the future, because a strong decline in net currency 
reserves would damage their credibility. In view of the 
efficient and strongly integrated financial markets, a system of 
firm, though adjustable exchange rates is always in danger of 
being tested. 
  Conversely, extended periods of stable exchange rates are 
better for the cohesion of the monetary union, because the 
potential harmony in stability can be better and more quickly 
observed. This also includes a rapprochement in the financial 
sector. As an "impressive example" for the different "financial 
culture" in Europe, the Bundesbank cited the British and the 
Germans. While in Great Britain loans with variable interest 
rates are widespread, in Germany there is a preference for 
longer-term fixed interest rates. Therefore, in Great Britain, 
changes in short-term interest rates, which are influenced by 
the central bank, have a relatively strong influence on 
available income, in particular since private households have 
relatively high debts. This has consequences for monetary 
policy, as the experience of the EMS crisis in 1992 show. 
  The experiences gained so far with the wider fluctuation 
ranges have shown that the divergence of the exchange rates 
stays within narrow limits. Initial exchange rate losses in the 
expanded fluctuation ranges have meanwhile been largely 
compensated. "Whether and when" narrower fluctuation ranges can 
be justified again cannot yet be predicted, in the Bundesbank's 
opinion. First of all, it is necessary to observe over a longer 
test period how the market courses develop without narrow 
"safety fences." The risk of new turbulences should not be 
underestimated. One also has to ask whether a formal narrowing 
of fluctuation ranges is necessary at all to handle the 
transition toward the monetary union. 
  Nevertheless, the Bundesbank is skeptical regarding the 
target of an economic and monetary union before the end of this 
century. It refers to the report by the EC Commission, which 
shows rather disappointing progress in the member countries. 
The situation of public finances has considerably deteriorated 
in all countries because of strong slumps in the economic 
development, reduced tax revenues, and additional state 
expenditures. In 11 of 12 member countries -- including the FRG 
-- the budgets did not fulfill the criteria of the monetary 
union in 1993. The Bundesbank expressed relief about the 
failure of the new "Union loans" to procure money in Brussels 
for infrastructure and environmental projects. This would have 
opened the door to financing the EC budget via loans in the 
longer term and would have undermined the urgently necessary 
budget discipline. "The goal of establishing a monetary union 
in Europe within the foreseeable future would thus be seriously 
endangered," the Bundesbank says.

Bruessel; place and date not given: "Mr. Ruehe, What Will 
Happen With the Bundeswehr?"] 
  [Text] [Bruessel] Mr. Ruehe, how many soldiers will the 
Bundeswehr have in the future? 
  [Ruehe] My precisely formulated proposal has been presented. 
In it, I concretely mention a reduction to 340,000 men, whose 
number, however, can be increased to an internationally 
stipulated maximum strength of 370,000 men in the structures. 
  [Bruessel] Will military service be reduced to 10 months? 
  [Ruehe] We want to differentiate here. For service in the 
main defense forces, a compact basic military service of 10 
months without service compensation time like in France is 
useful and sufficient. However, for voluntary service in the 
crisis-reaction forces, at least 12 months are required. 
  [Bruessel] Will the Bundeswehr still be operational in the 
future? 
  [Ruehe] Only with my approach will we get the financial 
scope for the strengthening and modernization of the armed 
forces. 
  [Bruessel] Does Chancellor Kohl approve of your concept? 
  [Ruehe] I discussed my ideas with the chancellor at a very 
early stage, and we agree on the outlines of the Bundeswehr's 
further development.

<F P=106> ["eli."-signed report: "Military Leadership Supports </F>
Ruehe's Bundeswehr Plans"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann 
has unreservedly backed Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's plans 
for a Bundeswehr reform. In an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG, Naumann said the conceptual guidelines for the future 
of the armed forces are also supported by the military 
leadership. Those who bury the concept ignore the facts: With 
the armed forces' present budget of 47.5 billion German marks, 
370,000 men cannot be financed. "Those who claim the contrary 
lose their credibility," Naumann said. 
  According to the key features that have become known so far, 
the Bundeswehr is to be reduced from 370,000 to 320,000 or 
340,000 men, and military service is to be reduced by two months 
to 10 months. Naumann said the objective is to achieve a 
consensus among the parties on the mandate, the defense system, 
and the finances of the Army and to give the armed forces a 
rough structure before the Bundestag election. Now, the point 
is not to hold a discussion on positions. These details of the 
Bundeswehr planning can only be defined by next spring when the 
cornerstones of the concept are accepted, he said. 
  Since the turn of the year, Naumann has prepared the defense 
policy guidelines "in close cooperation" with Ruehe, as he said. 
He stressed that the concept will also be supported by the 
military leadership if two conditions are fulfilled: the 
service compensation time for draftees -- the compensation of 
overtime by time off, which is regulated by law -- has to be 
discontinued because otherwise, useful military training cannot 
be ensured any longer in 10 months. Moreover, the money saved 
by the new organization must be preserved for the defense 
budget, "otherwise the problem of an insufficiently financed 
Bundeswehr that devours itself by its operations will be 
repeated." If this condition were fulfilled, the investment 
share in the budget could be increased to about 28 percent by 
1990. 
  Naumann affirmed that he is looking for a way "to show the 
troop again the light at the end of the tunnel." If a troop 
strength of 370,000 men is fixed with the present budget, the 
situation will no longer be tolerable. He is sure that the 
troop will also support the changes "because everyone knows that 
things cannot go on like this." A "hollow" Bundeswehr with 
370,000 men who neither have modern equipment nor challenging 
training is not the political instrument that is needed for the 
security of the country, he said. 
  According to Naumann, political will has to be shown to 
discontinue the service compensation time for draftees. Only in 
this way can a service of 10 months be justified. He is 
convinced that the military quality of training will not suffer 
if the service lasts 10 months. Rather, the draftee will be 
challenged during the whole of his service, it will be possible 
to organize the training better in all military services, and 
their efficiency might even be increased. However, details sill 
have to be intensively examined, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Peter </F>
Ellgaard; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ellgaard] I now welcome Foreign Minister and Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel in our 
studio. Good afternoon, Mr. Kinkel. 
  The FDP Bundestag Group is already signaling a certain 
agreement to Ruehe's [Bundeswehr] plans. Why are you still 
against the reduction of the staff and military service? Are 
you only cross because the defense minister did not brief you in 
time? 
  [Kinkel] Well, the point is that an attempt has to be made 
to find a new concept for the Bundeswehr. Within the framework 
of this concept, the question of a reduction of the 370,000 men 
is also at issue. This would have internal and external 
effects. Internally, the question about the number of long-term 
servicemen, draftees, professional soldiers, and garrisons would 
arise. Externally, since the constitution has not been amended, 
we have so far been unable to participate in the United Nations 
and elsewhere in crises as it would actually be required. All 
that has to be reconsidered. Therefore, I insisted on discussing 
this in the coalition first and then making a decision afterward. 
  [Ellgaard] Is there an alternative to the financial 
framework of 47.5 billion German marks [DM]? There is hardly 
another choice than to reduce compulsory military service and 
the troop strength. 
  [Kinkel] Well, for the time being, Volker Ruehe has to cope 
with this financial framework of DM47.5 billion. I never said 
this was impossible. We really have to implement a reduction 
because there is no other way. However, as far as the concept 
is concerned, I would like to know and discuss whether there are 
any other possibilities. Once again, I would like to say that 
we will discuss this in the coalition talks on Tuesday [26 
April]. This is the correct way. I was mainly interested in 
that. 
  [Ellgaard] Will you make the Bundeswehr or the possible 
employment of the Bundeswehr abroad, for example, a topic in the 
election campaign? 
  [Kinkel] On no account do I want the Bundeswehr to become a 
topic in the election campaign, because the Bundeswehr has to be 
kept out of party quarrels. It must have safe plans for itself, 
the soldiers, and their families. We have to put an end to the 
continuous disorder. In the first place, one thing cannot be 
right -- that is, that we have this much money and we can afford 
this much of the Bundeswehr with it, but we have to say that we 
will need the Bundeswehr for defense and outside crisis 
management in the future. For this purpose, we need this many 
men and it must be possible to finance this. 
  [Ellgaard] Mr. Kinkel, regarding the topic of Yugoslavia: 
You have already advocated a tougher line toward the Serbs, but 
is there not the danger that the West will stumble into a war 
with an uncertain end, like in Vietnam? 
  [Kinkel] I hope not. However, it is correct that there may 
be military and political risks -- military risks in so far as 
we have to wait and see how the Serbian side will react and also 
with a view to the UN Protection Force deployed there. 
Political risks may arise with Russia, for example. I think 
that after the latest Security Council session, we can proceed 
on the assumption that Russia will agree to the Gorazde 
scenario. Regarding the measures that NATO resolved for the 
other security zones, we cannot yet say what will happen. 
  [Ellgaard] What about the Bundeswehr's involvement? You 
have been against it so far. Meanwhile, Mr. Yeltsin, but also 
Denmark, has been calling for something similar to what Mr. 
Schaeuble has suggested -- that is, the Bundeswehr's military 
involvement. 
  [Kinkel] First of all, we have our constitutional risk. Let 
us proceed on the assumption that the Federal Constitutional 
Court will give us the green light, so to speak, in June or 
July. Basically, I believe it will probably be difficult to get 
the German Bundestag's agreement to the employment of Bundeswehr 
soldiers in the former Yugoslavia. However, those who advocate 
it, like Schaeuble, also say that everyone would have to agree. 
Regarding the parties to the conflict, one can certainly 
proceed on the assumption that at least one party to the 
conflict would definitely not agree to the employment of German 
soldiers. 
  [Ellgaard] The Serbs? 
  [Kinkel] The Serbian side.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Illegal Dealing in Nuclear </F>
Material Soaring"] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- The Hesse Office of Criminal 
Investigations (LKA) has reported a "marked increase" in illegal 
trafficking of radioactive material. The office said yesterday 
that three incidents of nuclear crimes were registered in 1991, 
while the number increased to nine in 1992, and rocketed to 30 
in 1993. From January 1992 to the end of February 1993, almost 
200 incidents from all over Germany were reported to the Federal 
Office for Criminal Investigations. 
  According to German security authorities, the nuclear crimes 
scene is dominated by Russians, Poles, and Czechs. The material 
comes from national installations in East Europe and is smuggled 
to Germany from there, evading existing security systems. 
  Quite frequently, the hot material is smuggled to Germany 
via 
the Baltic states, Poland, and southeastern European countries. 
The LKA said that due to economic difficulties in the East, the 
FRG is "particularly attractive." Yet, the efforts of the 
nuclear dealers to make profitable deals in Germany usually fail 
because there is no illegal market for ultimate consumers of 
radioactive material -- at least according to information 
available so far. Nevertheless, the LKA fears that radioactive 
substances will continue to be available in Germany. 
  According to information made available to DIE WELT, 
smugglers use military installations of Russian troops stationed 
in the former GDR as intermediate stores for substances like 
uranium-238. The material, of which 40 kilograms were recently 
offered in Germany's black market, is said to have come from 
Siberia on military transport aircraft. DIE WELT has a drawing 
of the special container in which the dealers are said to have 
taken uranium to customers in Hamburg. 
  The German mediator and transporter of the Russian-Polish 
nuclear cartel is an engineer from Saxony who claims to have 
access to the Russian uranium stockpile. The man also offers 
specially treated, and thus radioactive, mercury products for 
antiradar coatings of items such as tanks or reconnaissance 
satellites, which makes them unrecognizable to radar imaging. 
Price per kilo: 50,000 marks. Photocopies of the Russian 
original certificates have also been made available to DIE WELT. 
  In 1993, the Hesse LKA carried out investigations on 92 
suspects, 65 of whom were foreigners -- mainly East Europeans. 
In several cases indications of organized crime emerged during 
these investigations, the Hesse LKA said. Several uranium 
pellets and 500 grams of osmium-186 have been seized. There 
have been some cases of dealers offering nuclear substances 
fraudulently, the LKA said. 
  The Hesse investigators have also found that nonradioactive 
substances, such as scandium, europium, cobalt, osmium, and red 
mercury are "increasingly" appearing in the illegal markets. 
Police assure that so far no radioactive substances that are 
suitable for producing arms have been seized. Nevertheless, 
smuggling and dealing in nuclear material involves considerable 
danger, both for the smugglers and for the population, because 
improper handling of the material can cause most severe 
radiation damage.

<F P=106> [Armin Pfahl-Traughber article: "Republikaner in First </F>
Place"] 
  [Text] Whereas in France there is an extremist right-wing 
party in the shape of the National Front, which includes the 
majority of French extreme right-wing factions, in Germany the 
extremist right-wing landscape contains fissures. Ideological 
and strategic differences, internal jostling for power, and 
personal grudges created a split that, as time went by, created 
mutual obstacles in extreme right-wing party politics. An 
example of this effect is illustrated by the 19 September 1993 
Hamburg municipal elections, where although extreme right-wing 
parties together gained a total of 7.6 percent of the votes, 
they failed to reach the 5-percent threshold on account of their 
competing candidacies, and thus failed to gain seats on the 
municipal council. The following survey permits a view of the 
development of the extreme right-wing political landscape. 
  Without doubt the most significant extreme right-wing party 
today are the Republikaner, founded in 1983 as a right-wing 
Christian Social Union [CSU] faction, or "right of center" 
party, by the two former Bundestag deputies Franz Handlos and 
Eckhard Voight and the former television reporter Franz 
Schoenhuber. In subsequent years, there were hefty internal 
disputes among the Republikaner, caused by differences of 
opinion about the party's orientation. Whereas Handlos wanted 
the Republikaner to be a conservative alternative to the CSU, 
Schoenhuber wanted to orient the party in a similar direction to 
the French Front National. In the end, Schoenhuber had his way, 
which resulted in former activists from traditional extreme 
right-wing organizations joining the Republikaner and taking 
over leading Republikaner posts, for example Harald Neubauer. 
  This political orientation also found increasingly clearer 
expression in the party's programs and publicity. Adjustments 
to these were made later, but they were dictated not by a wish 
to revise contents, but by tactical needs. Thus, Schoenhuber 
described a softening of tone in the program as a "verbal 
revision." The Republikaner want to appear as a serious party 
that is faithful to the constitution, said Schoenhuber. That is 
the only way they can have an influence on broad public opinion, 
according to him. 
<H5>  Against Foreigners </H5>
  Since then, the Republikaner have avoided making extremist 
right-wing statements, which does not mean that they never make 
them. For instance, Schoenhuber approves of the Mussolini 
regime's economic policies between 1926 and 1930, and for his 
deputy Rolf Schlierer "the political distinction between friend 
and foe" is a typical structural element of extremist doctrine. 
In view of such views, the statements of senior Republikaner 
functionaries who have left the party's ranks come as no 
surprise. For example, former Republikaner general manager 
Centa Hirsch said that Schoenhuber does not want to turn the 
party into a modern right-conservative party, and that "instead 
of pursuing a path of overcoming violence," he stirs up 
aggression against foreigners with his public appearances. 
  But normally, leader Republikaner functionaries proceed more 
carefully and formulate their political positions in such a way 
that they do not appear extremely right wing at first glance, 
but are capable of being interpreted that way. This tactical 
concession has nothing to do with an acceptance of the 
democratic principles of a law-governed country. Even the 
exclusion from the Republikaner of the group of former members 
of traditional right-wing extremist parties whom Schoenhuber 
himself invited to join the Republikaner is no indication of 
such an acceptance, this exclusion being a mere strategic option 
dictated by internal power struggles. In the 10 years of the 
Republikaner's existence, a total of 10 groups have broken away 
from the party to form parties of their own. 
  In elections, support for the Republikaner has been 
fluctuating all the time. The party received 3 percent of the 
votes in the 1986 Bavarian Landtag elections, viewed as a 
"relative election success," but was unable to maintain this 
support in subsequent elections and received about 1 percent of 
the votes thereafter. Not until the elections to the Berlin 
Chamber of Deputies and the 1989 European elections did the 
party receive a surprising 7.5 percent and 7.1 percent of the 
votes respectively, which, needless to say, was followed by 
another ebb in support, with the party receiving only 2.1 
percent of the vote in the 1990 Bundestag elections. 
  According to their own figures, the Republikaner have 24,000 
members. Even so, the party lacks a sufficient personal and 
organizational basis for its political activity, something which 
appears rather obvious when one views its parliamentary activity. 
  In terms of political significance in the right-wing camp, 
the German People's Union [DVU] is in second place. It was 
founded in 1971 as an association, and was converted to a party 
in 1987. Between those two years its chairman, the Munich 
publisher Gerhard Frey, tried to establish a readership within 
the DVU of his extremist right-wing newspapers such as the 
DEUTSCHE NATIONALZEITUNG. When it appeared that election 
mandates might be quite profitable, Frey made a daring move and 
entered the world of (election) politics. 
  In 1987, the DVU ran for the Bremen municipal elections with 
a massive publicity campaign, and received 3.4 percent of the 
votes. This result was followed by further successes in the 
north, 6.2 percent of the votes in the 1991 Bremen Landtag 
elections and 6.3 percent in the Schlewsig-Holstein elections. 
In most of the other elections, the party tended to suffer 
defeat, for instance at the 1989 Europe vote, where it only 
received 1.2 percent. 
<H5>  The DVU Incapable of Action </H5>
  The DVU claims to have 26,000 members, but it has even less 
of a functioning structure than the Republikaner because it 
consists mostly of passive members. Even inside the Bundestag 
the DVU has completely inexperienced and incompetent deputies 
who receive their instructions from party headquarters in 
Munich. Individual DVU fractions have disintegrated relatively 
quickly on account of internal disputes, so that continuous 
parliamentary activity is also impossible for this reason. The 
DVU's ability to act depends almost exclusively on one factor -- 
its chairman's finances. Programatically, the DVU has virtually 
nothing to say. The program consists of a single A4 sheet of 
paper with 12 vague points. 
  The National Democratic Party of Germany [NPD], the oldest 
extremist right-wing party, forced in 1964, also possesses 
little more significance in its own political camp. It was 
incapable of following on from its elections successes in the 
second half of the 1960's, and achieved only sporadic low-level 
election successes, for example 2.1 percent of the votes at the 
1988 Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag elections. As a result of the 
decades of defeat, more and more activists quit the NPD as time 
went by, so that today the NPD is one of the few extremist 
right-wing groups that does not claim to have any popularity. 
The NPD claims to have only 5,000 members left. The exodus of 
members is encouraged by the policies of its chairman, Guenther 
Deckert, who wants to gear the party to traditional political 
concepts and harbors unofficial contacts with neo-Nazi activists. 
<H5>  The German League </H5>
  Many ex-NPD officials organized themselves into yet another 
extremist right-wing party, the German League for People and 
Homeland [DL], in 1991. The DL's declared purpose was to cement 
together the disintegrated political landscape. Relatively 
well-known former officials from the above-mentioned parties 
joined the DL within a short period of time, but the DL's actual 
objective was never reached. On the contrary, the DL's 
existence has led to a further disintegration of the extreme 
right-wing political landscape. The DL is represented in the 
European Parliament by Republikaner deputies, but with its 800 
members and completely nonexistent party structures, except in a 
few regional centers, it is of hardly any significance 
whatsoever. 
  In addition, there are a few neo-Nazi formations that 
possess 
party statutes, such as the Free Workers Party of Germany [FAD], 
but have been classified as pressure groups on account of their 
own view of themselves. 
<H5>  No Unity </H5>
  Despite their similarity, the extreme right-wing 
organizations do not form a united political bloc. The personal 
grudges of their chairmen, each party's insistence on its own 
independence, and ideological and strategic differences have 
supposedly prevented these organizations from gathering within a 
single bloc. In any case, the era of opposing election blocs of 
extremist right-wing parties seems to be over, as suggested by 
the results of the Hamburg elections. In Hamburg, the 
Republikaner succeeded for the first time in outstripping their 
election competitors on their own territory. The DVU was 
incapable of making any impression in these elections because it 
lacks a functioning party structure and because it is 
permanently geared to the role of an election party. The NPD, 
DL, and FAD are of no significance in any case. In the future, 
the extremist right-wing vote could go to the Republikaner.

<F P=106> [Uwe Backes article: "An Urge to `Fulfillment'"] </F>
  [Text] Nowhere in Europe did a communist dictatorship and 
pluralist democracy collide so hard as in divided Germany. For 
better or worse, the political fate of the extreme Left in the 
West was closely linked to "real socialism." In the first few 
years after the war, the Communist Party of Germany [KDP], 
profiting from the bloody resistance against the Nazi regime and 
linked to Moscow and East Berlin, still played a major part on 
the left-wing fringe of the political spectrum (it was present 
in the Parliamentary Council, in the landtags, laender 
governments, and Bundestag), but it was banned in 1956, and its 
successor, the German Communist Party [DKP] founded in 1968, did 
not enjoy any significant election successes. 
  The lack of attraction, or rather the repulsiveness, of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] reduced the chances of 
the small western "fraternal parties." The people in power in 
the east attempted to boost the western communist parties by 
means of high subsidies, over 70 million German marks per year. 
Thanks to this, the DKP was able to exert a not insignificant 
cultural influence in the West in the form of its own newspaper 
and publishing empire, and infiltrate such social spheres as 
educational establishments, individual trade unions such as the 
Trade Union of Education and Science [GEW], and the network of 
"new social movements." Other groups from the extreme Left also 
received smaller pieces of the big East Berlin pie inasmuch as 
they availed themselves of the DKP's technical and 
organizational infrastructure. But by and large, the existence 
of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] was a burden, even 
though people did not spare their criticism and geared 
themselves to more remote patterns and models like Castro's 
Cuba, Tito's Yugoslavia, Enver Hoxha's Albania, and Mao Zedong's 
China, and even the writings of Leo Trotsky. 
<H5>  The Crisis in the DKP </H5>
  The demise of "real socialism" and the end of the SED regime 
led to great changes in the extreme left. According to he 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, total 
membership of extreme left-wing organizations fell from 41,000 
at the end of 1989 to 29,500 at the end of 1990. At the end of 
1992, membership rose to 29,000. Particularly hard hit was the 
DKP, already weakened by a power struggle between 
traditionalists and adherents of renewal. The end of material 
benefits from the SED caused the DKP's party-owned media empire 
to collapse and necessitated drastic personnel reductions inside 
the DKP apparatus and in allied organizations. The "Spartakus" 
student organization was disbanded in June 1990, and the 
shrinking West Berlin SED offshoot bearing the name of the 
Socialist Unity party of West Berlin was restructured and 
renamed. The number of DKP members fell from over 35,000 at the 
end of 1988 to less than 7,000 at the end of 1993. Although a 
personnel reshuffle took place among the party leadership, the 
traditionalist ultra-Orthodox segment pushed through in the end. 
The DKP assumed the nature of a sect and became hardly capable 
of maintaining an alliance. 
  If the DKP was the extremist left-wing party with the 
greatest membership in western Germany before the turnabout, 
after the turnabout this position was assumed by the Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS], into which the SED had changed 
itself. The PDS (originally SED-PDS) was not banned, and was 
the legal heir of the SED. There was of course an exodus of 
members, so that out of the 2.3 million SED members in August 
1989, there were not even 10 percent left. By the end of 1992, 
the party membership files had sunk to about 120,000 names. 
  According to PDS data, in 1991, 95 percent of PDS members 
came from the SED. Particularly well-represented in the PDS was 
the intellectual GDR elite consisting of teachers, scientists, 
and artists. This information alone suggests that the turnabout 
propagated by the PDS leadership kept to narrow limits. An 
ideological opening-up might have been signalled by means of 
references to such authorities as August Bebel and Eduard 
Bernstein, but the stubborn adherence to earlier advocates of 
Marxist-Leninist tradition removed the credibility from any 
attempt at an ideological opening-up. 
  The same applies to internal party reforms. On the one hand, 
the democratic centralism of the past was split up by allowing 
the formation of "workers cooperatives" and "platforms" with 
various ideological profiles, but on the other hand an almost 
all-powerful party presidium emerged, and the 
strongly-constrained "pluralism" was also extended to hard-line 
communists such as the Communist Platform. 
  Naturally, the PDS hard liners maintain the closest links 
with the DKP. In addition, the PDS is concerned with availing 
itself of as much of the potential beyond the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany and Greens as possible. Comprehensive contacts 
are taking shape within the party "base" and inside various 
bodies, for example vis-a-vis the German Communist Party [KPD] 
that was formed in 1990 during the GDR's existence; or the 
Federation of West German Communists that was formed in 1980; 
the Workers Federation for the Reestablishment of the KPD; the 
ecological-fundamentalist Ecological Left; and the United 
Socialist Party, a party formed in 1986 out of a merger of 
Trotskyists and former Stalinist and pro-Albanian communists. 
But these are all small groups that share a few hundred members 
between them at the very most. 
  On the other hand, the two extreme left-wing organizations 
with the largest memberships after the PDS and DKP refuse to 
link themselves to any political federation. The 
Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany, claiming to have 2,000 
members, continues to refer to the teachings of Stalin and Mao 
Zedong, and sympathizes with the Maoist guerrilla organization 
"Sendero Luminoso" [Shining Path] of Peru. The Marxist Group, 
with about 10,000 members, mainly from the university milieu, 
seems to continue to exist secretly even though it dissolved 
itself in May 1991. This fact is suggested by the appearance of 
an agitation journal called GEGENSTANDPUNKT since that date. 
  The PDS itself is seeking contacts with the proviolence 
groups of "autonomists" that have gained popularity since the 
turnabout (in 1993 they had about 5,000 members). The "Scene," 
consisting mainly of 18-28 year-olds, is hardly affected by the 
often-quoted "crisis of the Left" because it has never been 
connected to any governing political orthodoxy, and its aversion 
to any theory or organization, suggesting an exposure to 
anarchist influence, conforms to a trend toward "alternative" 
fundamentalistically oppositionist subcultures that was visible 
long before 1989. The usually loosely structured groups that 
are concentrated in a few large German cities, including 
university cities (for example Berlin), are joined together by a 
hatred of imperialism, capitalism, and state violence. In 
addition, they are much more interested in militant "actions" 
than theoretical discussions. For years, they have borne 
responsibility for most of the acts of violence possessing an 
extremist left-wing background (797 such acts in 1991, 972 in 
1992, and even more in 1993, according to the Federal Office for 
the Protection of the Constitution). 
<H5>  The "Autonomous Scene" </H5>
  The "Autonomous Scene" is linked to the milieu that supports 
terrorist organizations, whereby the environment of the Red Army 
Faction [RAF] and Revolutionary Cells [RZ] displays a higher 
degree of ideological and strategic discipline. In addition, 
the political turnabout of 1989 onwards has left deep traces in 
left-wing terrorism, placed a question mark over political 
identity, and reduced the circle of helpers and sympathizers. 
The RAF was particularly affected by the discovery that it had 
had links with the GDR state security. Today, both underground 
and inside the prisons, the RAF is usually divided into two 
groups. One of them has abandoned the idea of an "armed 
struggle," but the other continues to adhere to it strongly. 
The shots fired at the headquarters of the Metalworkers 
Association in Cologne in November 1993, and especially the 
carefully planned and executed bombing of the newly constructed 
Weiterstadt correctional facility in March 1993, have cast 
doubts on whether the so-called "commando levels" are at all 
capable of holding talks. 
  Hopes for an end to extreme left-wing violence seem to have 
proven as naive as hopes for an end to left-wing ideology. 
Instead, the left-wing and right-wing extremes seem to be 
helping each other back onto their feet. In view of the rise in 
right-wing extremism, "anti-Fascism" once again seems to be in 
vogue. It improves the chances for broad social groups to 
mobilize themselves, and at the same time serves as a 
replacement for the now-lost feeling of reassurance connected to 
the past. In the meantime, circles of theoreticians are working 
on a redefinition and modernization of well-worn dusty 
doctrines. Out of anarchy, Marxism, pacifism, and feminism, new 
ideological compositions are being created to dampen the 
soon-to-reappear urge for fulfillment, for the solving of 
problems, and for predicting the future.

<F P=106> [Report by Bernd Wagner: "Many Splinter Groups"] </F>
  [Text] The nonmilitant, right-wing extremist parties in 
the FRG -- in particular, the Republikaner (Rep), the National 
Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), the German People's Union, 
and, since 1991, the German League for People and Homeland (DL) 
-- have been trying to develop organizational structures since 
they became masterminded by the West in the wake of the fall of 
the wall. Although they encountered a lot of support from all 
generations, it took them some time to establish working 
structures at the land level. The situation was even worse at 
the local level. Despite the recognizable major right-leaning 
protest potential among the population, they did not achieve any 
success in the elections. The most sizable gains were achieved 
from among workers and employees who had been affected by 
unemployment and social decline. 
  The most active partisans of right-wing extremism in eastern 
Germany are young people. Young workers, people employed in the 
industrial service sector, and pupils and apprentices make up 
the bulk. Approximately one-third can be counted as 
marginalized milieus. People with higher education are rather 
rare. 
  The right-wing extremist protest milieu is structured in 
local, regional, and supraregional scenes, which are linked 
together and communicate and consciously identify themselves 
through militant actions, slogans, and accessories. The central 
unit is the small group, which safeguards the various values of 
the right-wing extremist movement as "central points." Then 
there is a number of right-wing extremist bands and "zines," 
most of which are anchored in the skinhead milieu and which 
strengthen right-wing extremist orientation emotionally. 
Ideology is being conveyed via music and lyrics that catch on. 
On the one hand, these are verbal slogans and on the other, 
ideologically pepped-up images and similes. The "zines," which 
are very popular among young right-wing extremists, work on the 
basis of cartoons. There is a distinct language of images and 
symbols, which is not immediately accessible to those not in the 
know. 
  The "young," right-wing extremists' interest focuses on 
"neo-Nazi" and "national-revolutionary" ideas. They use 
familiar formulas of a "true" socialism, social equality, and 
justice. At the same time, they take over the aversion against 
"bigwig structures." Socialist Unity Party of Germany and FRG 
leaders are presented as interchangeable. Like "real socialism" 
in the past, capitalism is being looked at extremely critically 
and is considered outdated. It is seen as bringing mass 
unemployment and a housing shortage to the Germans and as 
ruining the ecological substance. The state should be "national." 
  Mystical Teutomania, racism, and Social Darwinism are 
further 
ideological elements that may develop into distinct, local 
mixtures. Foreigners constitute a central "potential of threat" 
for the "purity of the race and German culture," for jobs and 
apartments of "Germans." The theoretical substance of the 
ideology and its elements is not very marked. Yet, this does 
not speak against its effect, which is based on unreal 
connections and myths: Ideology becomes a virtual substitute 
for religion. 
  Within the militant right-wing extremist protest milieu, 
various small organizations have emerged in the new laender 
bearing unambiguous names, such as the Social Revolutionary 
Workers Front (SrA) as a legal branch of the banned Nationalist 
Front (NF), the Central German Youth Promotion Organization 
(FM), which recently also became known as Direct Action Central 
Germany. 
  Apart from that, there are "groups of comrades," which are 
active as autonomous local groups -- for example the Greifswald 
National Socialists (GNS), the Hitler Youth Schoenfeld in 
Leipzig -- or other groups, which are partly affiliated to other 
organizations or are autonomous, such as the Nationalist Youth 
Schwedt (NJS). The "groups of comrades," which also include 
themselves with organizations such as German Alternative, 
National Offensive, and National List, see themselves as 
elements of the "ideological community of the New Front" (GdNF), 
an ideological community linked to the name of Michael Kuehnen 
and the NSDAP (AO) [National Socialist German Workers Party, 
Nazi Party (Foreign Branch)], which acts from its base in the 
United States. 
  These groupings are cadre organizations with strict criteria 
regarding membership and discipline. The cadre keeps a cover 
toward the security authorities. This includes that even 
members of the same group are treated under the intelligence 
service principle of restricted access to information. The 
planning of activities and strategic and tactical discussions 
take place at "leader meetings" at a local, regional, and 
supraregional level. Branched out widely in the direct 
neighborhood of cadre groups, there are numerous autonomous 
groupings with differing social features. The spectrum ranges 
from loose children's groups, youth club scenes, and criminal 
gangs to disciplined organizations that stand up for their 
ideological convictions. Their common denominator is right-wing 
extremist ideology and the readiness to use violence that is 
based on enemy images and the idea of natural inequality of 
people. 
  In recent times, the classic militant concept that was 
developed by former neo-Nazi "fuehrer" Michael Kuehnen has been 
changed. After the pogrom of August 1992 in Rostock, the scene 
began to understand that it was not useful to make a permanently 
militant appearance. After all, this was giving the state a 
chance to bust groups. The new concept is: creating autonomous 
groups of comrades that are not linked to official political 
structures and that are, at the same time, an element of 
"normal" social structures, such as the regulars of a club. 
  The loose, unorganized "skinhead" scene in the new laender 
is 
particularly dangerous. It was predominantly neo-Nazi-oriented 
up until 1989-90. As of 1991, the scene began to split into 
various groups. Despite their differing orientations, it 
remains an important factor for the threat to internal security. 
It is there where the readiness to use violence and terror 
meet, leading again and again to manslaughter, severe cases of 
bodily injury, and breach of public peace.

<F P=106> [Article by Gisbert Kuhn: "There Are Worlds Separating </F>
Political Demands and Reality"] 
  [Text] The political rightists who were dispatched to the 
European Parliament by German voters on 18 June 1989 feel that 
their performance is being undervalued and are even talking of a 
"massive campaign" directed against them by the media and other 
dark forces. Late in the summer of last year, when Social 
Democrat European Deputy Detlev Samland presented a report 
stating that the five men and one woman who were originally 
grouped around Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber did 
indeed have big mouths, but hardly stood out in terms of their 
presence in parliament or their parliamentary work, there was a 
storm of protest. Retired criminal investigation official 
Klaus-Peter Koehler from Heidenheim (Brenz) even had 
announcements published in newspapers in which he branded the 
report "the deliberate falsification of information." 
<H5>  "A Warning" </H5>
  Five years ago, the Republikaner's ability to obtain 7.1 
percent of the vote in the European elections attracted 
attention well beyond Germany's borders and caused great 
commotion in the media. At the time, their success was viewed as 
a "warning" issued by citizens to those in government, but was 
also seen as being partly due to the right-wingers' 
anti-European program. Entitled "German Interests Have 
Priority," the Dinkelsbuehl declaration on the European 
elections contained the following points: "No unilateral 
Western integration," "no to placing Germany at a disadvantage," 
"no to the right to vote for foreigners," "no to surrendering 
sovereignty." 
<H5>  No Movement Politically </H5>
  This clearly indicated that the policies the German 
right-wing extremists would pursue in Strasbourg would be geared 
solely to obstruction and not to constructive participation. 
Three and a half years later, in March 1993, former criminal 
investigation official Koehler admitted to an Ulm newspaper: 
"We have achieved a few minor points, but politically we have 
not achieved any movement." However, initiatives such as that 
launched by his colleague Johanna-Christiana Grund from the 
Bavarian pilgrimage center of Altoetting could hardly be 
described as a "minor point": "Entry to and the Exercise of the 
Profession of Alpine Mountain Guide in EC Member States." 
  The history of the Republikaner in the European Parliament 
was from the outset one of violent disputes and quarrels with 
those of a similar political persuasion from other partner 
countries. In 1989, six Republikaner moved into the building of 
concrete and glass in Strasbourg: Franz Schoenhuber (journalist 
from Munich) as leader, Johanna-Christina Grund (mountain guide 
from Altoetting), Klaus-Peter Koehler (retired criminal 
investigation official from Heidenheim), Harald Neubauer 
(journalist from Munich), Emil Schlee (retired ministerial 
assistant from Raisdorf-Reuterkoppel), and Hans-Guenther 
Schodruch (lawyer from Siegburg). 
  A month later, the group started talks with right-wing 
radicals from other countries to agree on close cooperation and 
the formation of a joint group in the European Parliament. At 
the very start, there was a dispute with the fascist Italian 
Social Movement because the Germans had denounced the 
"repression of the German-speaking population in South Tirol." 
However, in the case of another two parties -- the French Front 
National, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, and the Flemish Vlaams Blok, 
led by Carel Dillen -- Schoenhuber and his people did not want 
to agree on a common platform but only on "technical 
cooperation." Le Pen only reluctantly accepted Schoenhuber's 
complaints about the "the German people's right to live in one 
free state with guaranteed rights," whereby the German meant the 
"1937 borders." 
<H5>  Busy With Themselves </H5>
  Of course, the Republikaner guild in Strasbourg busied 
itself 
most of all with itself and that led to its finally being de 
facto dissolved. The party's Bavarian chairman, Harald Neubauer 
(a former German National Party member and later a close 
confidante of the notorious DVU leader and friend of 
ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy, Gerhard Frey) challenged Franz 
Schoenhuber for the leadership. As a result, in September 1990, 
the Republikaner leadership released the five European 
representatives (with the exception of Schoenhuber) "from the 
duties toward the party immediately" and instituted expulsion 
proceedings against them. 
  On 3 December 1990, Franz Schoenhuber left the "Rightist 
Group" in Strasbourg. He justified the move by saying the 
Republikaner could not have anything in common with neo-Nazis, 
racists, and extremists. He leveled such charges at Harald 
Neubauer, in particular. At the end of 1990, Johanna-Christina 
Grund and Neubauer were finally expelled from the party; in the 
spring of 1991, Koehler, Schlee, and Schodruch arrived at the 
same verdict by leaving the party themselves. Schlee and Frau 
Grund also left the "Rightist Group" in the European Parliament 
and have described themselves as "independent" since then, while 
Neubauer had himself made chairman of the extremist right-wing 
splinter party the "German League," which he helped form. 
  Although this is fiercely disputed by those concerned, in 
his 
report, SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] European Deputy 
Detlev Samland maintains that the Republikaner had almost no 
presence at all in Strasbourg. Nevertheless, by June of last 
year, they had submitted 139 statements, although they drew no 
response. The possible exception were contributions during 
debates made by Schoenhuber concerning himself and his past: "I 
was not an SS man; I was a soldier in the SS and I am not 
ashamed of that." All in all, it is not an exaggeration but 
more of an understatement that over the five years in which they 
have been active in the European Parliament, worlds have 
separated the Republikaner's original political demands and 
reality.

<F P=106> [Norbert Lepszy article: "Incompetent, at Odds With Each </F>
Other, and Ineffective Politically"] 
  [Text] How the Republikaner and the DVU [German People's 
Union] behave in concrete practice, especially at the district, 
land, and European levels, has not been examined in a thorough, 
systematic and comparative manner until now. A first attempt 
has been made by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. In December 
1993, the foundation published its results in the form of a 
study. 
  Although the DVU was included to provide a comprehensive 
picture, the study focused on the Republikaner and their 
activities in assemblies at the district, land, and European 
levels. Whereas the DVU clearly falls into the right-wing 
extremist category, cannot be taken seriously, and is 
incompetent, the Republikaner merit more serious attention. 
<H5>  Analysis </H5>
  The Republikaner are a populist, radical right-wing party 
with no clear dividing line separating them from right-wing 
extremism, especially in those areas in which a hostility toward 
foreigners, racism, and gut nationalism come to the fore in 
party agitation and propaganda. The main question of the 
research was to establish the Republikaner's political ability, 
their "manner of conducting disputes," and substantive and 
personnel competence in parliament. It was self-evident that 
consideration would be given to the three land parliaments to 
which radical right-wing and right-wing extremist parties had 
been elected -- Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein (DVU), and 
Baden-Wuerttemberg -- as well as the European Parliament 
(Republikaner). In selecting towns and districts, the following 
criteria were considered: the Republikaner share of the vote, 
achieving a regional balance, and a comparison of town and 
country. 
  On the basis of these considerations, the following areas 
were chosen: the city of Hannover, the district of Hannover, 
Duesseldorf, Cologne, the district of Rheingau-Taunus, 
Heidenheim, Pforzheim, Augsburg, and Rosenheim. In only a few 
isolated cases were other examples -- mostly similar and 
parallel cases -- considered. In those towns and districts, 
numerous conversations were conducted with representatives of 
parties and journalists, extensive material connected with 
parliamentary work was examined and collected, and the local 
press was assessed. 
  The survey of the Republikaner in district and municipal 
assemblies revealed the party's weaknesses at that level. 
Internal party organizational structures -- although they may 
differ from region to region -- have been barely developed. In 
quite a number of districts, they were to unable to take up the 
seats they had obtained, because of a severe lack of candidates. 
The elected representatives, some of whom have a right-wing 
extremist past, mainly lack political experience or competence 
in local politics. The focus of their work -- with some 
exceptions -- is not on dealing intensively with difficult local 
issues, but on constantly propagating the general populist 
slogans, prejudices, and affectations that make up Republikaner 
ideology. 
<H5>  Issues Concerning Foreigners </H5>
  The Republikaner are not a local level party from the point 
of view of the way in which they were formed and their key 
national, programmatic policies. Until now, they have not 
possessed fixed local policy concepts, but have only propagated 
stances on individual issues in their strongholds. However, 
those often fail to be linked to programmatic ideas at the 
federal level. The greatest exception is the only element that 
holds the Republikaner together: the question of foreigners and 
asylum. It is a cause and catalyst that runs like a thread 
through all policy levels -- from local policy to European 
policy -- in the desperate effort to link it to all political 
problems. So far, the party has not developed a stance of its 
own at the local level and the accompanying ability to deal with 
and solve matters in any particular policy area or field or even 
with regard to individual problems. In most of the towns and 
districts that were examined, the work of Republikaner groups 
clearly concentrated on policy on foreigners and asylum, whereas 
the classic topics of local politics were secondary as a result 
of a lack of competence. 
<H5>  Propaganda </H5>
  Thus, at all levels of representation, most Republikaner 
groupings have remained a "single issue party." That also 
applies to the Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag, in which the 
Republikaner have held 15 seats since April 1992. In many 
assembles, they operate according to the same simple pattern: 
Almost all issues on which they have expressed a view are in 
some way -- indirectly or often polemically -- connected with 
the question of foreigners and asylum. Their patent solution for 
all problems, extending from economic and social policy to 
policy on the environment, policy on political and economic 
systems, is to seal off Germany from foreigners. In the case of 
the Republikaner, all policy ends up in the blind alley of 
nationalist isolation. 
  This concentration on policy on foreigners and asylum is 
particularly evident in agitation and propaganda at the 
"grass-roots level," that is, in direct appeals to the 
population. The Republikaner agitation and propaganda work is 
inseparably linked to their work in parliament. To a large 
extent, those who work as party agitators are the same people 
who are represented in parliament. Frequently, particularly 
polemical group motions or questions are circulated as pamphlets 
for propaganda in the streets. These examples show that the 
Republikaner, despite their repeated efforts to achieve 
recognition from the "established" parties and democratic 
respectability, do not shrink from the defamation of their 
political opponents and minority groups and the oblique 
spreading of fear and aggression. That is why at the local 
level, they already rule themselves out for any form of 
cooperation. 
  There have repeatedly been disputes among Republikaner and 
DVU groupings at various levels of representation. Internal 
quarrels, disputes, and disagreements often determine the image 
of radical right-wing and right-wing extremist parties. 
According to a study conducted by the Southwest Radio, of the 
136 Republikaner groups in assemblies, 63 have either completely 
or partially fallen apart, and of the 402 office holders at the 
district level, only 289 remain. These findings were completely 
confirmed by what the Konrad Adenauer Foundation found in 
numerous towns and districts (for example, Duesseldorf, Cologne, 
Pforzheim, and Augsburg), at the land level (Bremen and 
Schleswig-Holstein), and especially in the European Parliament. 
There, Franz Schoenhuber is the only remaining Republikaner (of 
the original six), but as a deputy without a group. Like his 
former colleagues in the "Technical Group of the European 
Right," Schoenhuber frequently shines in concrete parliamentary 
work, especially commission work, by virtue of his absence. 
<H5>  No Dialogue </H5>
  The radical right-wing, right-wing extremist parties still 
lack a firm base in society. There is hardly any contact, let 
alone dialogue, between parties and voters. Parties and groups 
maintain few contacts with social groups and associations. 
Contacts with the administration, which are so important for 
local-level political work, are underdeveloped. The 
shortcomings do not help make up for the lack of experience and 
knowledge and insufficient competence on the part of elected 
representatives. 
  The conclusion is that those who vote for parties such as 
the 
Republikaner or the DVU cannot count on personnel continuity and 
organizational stability in those parties and groups. The voter 
does not opt for a specific political program or even a minimum 
ability to solve problems. Right-wing extremist and radical 
right-wing parties are still unable to act effectively and 
pursue politics under conditions of parliamentary democracy.

<F P=106> ["bf" report: "Monetary Policy `Does Not Prevent' Recovery"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Duesseldorf, 21 Apr -- In the view of its 
president, Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank can be satisfied with 
its policy. In the introduction to the annual report Tietmeyer 
writes that the central bank has carefully sounded out the 
existing margin in a difficult situation. With the slowing down 
of the persistent inflation and the resulting positive 
developments on the financial markets, the preconditions for an 
"appropriate and lasting" economic growth have improved 
decisively. "Monetary policy did not and does not prevent the 
process of economic recovery." 
  A "short-winded" monetary policy, which would have reduced 
the central bank interest rates aggressively and without 
consideration for the reemerging expectations of inflation, 
would hardly be so successful. "Cautious action, aimed at 
making positive expectations permanent, was, in the end, also in 
the interest of the other European countries." Also with a view 
to the second stage of the European Monetary Union, which has 
already begun, no doubts must arise about the orientation of 
German monetary policy toward stability. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chancellor Kohl Sees Clear Signs of </F>
Improvement"] 
  [Text] Hannover -- On Tuesday [19 April] evening, 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl opened the 1994 Hannover Industrial Fair, 
at which 6,848 exhibitors from 60 countries are displaying 
investment goods. This year's partner country is Hungary. 
  Kohl expressed optimism on the subject of economic 
development. Adhering to the text of a speech that had been 
distributed previously, he said that things are improving again. 
The spring of an economic boom is visible, he said. Industry 
spokesman Hans Peter Stihl also voiced optimism. Both speakers 
pointed out that the economic upturn does not mean that the 
problems with the labor market can be solved. 
  Kohl said that his certainty about an economic improvement 
was not just based on increased foreign orders. German industry 
itself has picked up again, he said. For the first time, west 
German industrial production has exceeded last year's level. In 
eastern Germany, a double-digit rate of growth has even been 
recorded. The benefits received by the laender have made 
eastern Germany the most attractive industrial location in all 
Europe, according to Kohl. That is why he is so fond of the 
expression "flourishing landscapes," even though he has been 
criticized for using it. He said that he was not wrong to use 
this expression as such; he had merely applied it to the wrong 
period. But flourishing landscapes will soon fill the picture, 
he said. 
  Kohl admitted that the economic improvement would not 
relieve 
the labor market immediately. The problem of the 4 million 
unemployed is still the biggest economic challenge, he said. 
The problem can only be solved through a joint effort. The 
conclusion of labor agreements would help, but it is also 
necessary to alter the various working time patterns. According 
to Kohl, the reason for the continuing high unemployment is not 
just the recession, but also a structural crisis. Therefore new 
ideas are required, and not new spending programs. The 
chancellor said that despite the forthcoming elections, no empty 
promises are going to be made, for financial-political 
credibility is more important than everything else. Kohl 
pointed out that according to the Bundesbank, inflation could 
drop to slightly more than 2 percent this year. He also 
indicated German industry's dependence on exports. Therefore it 
is important to encourage European integration. During 
Germany's turn as EU Council chairman in the second half of 
1994, Bonn wants to launch a new European deregulation 
initiative in the European Union to create extra maneuvering 
space for free trade. 
  Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the German Chamber of Trade 
and 
Industry, also spoke about order books slowly filling up. The 
utilization of industrial capacity is increasing and the 
prospects of exports are improving thanks to, among other 
things, the lively economic situation in the United States. The 
economic recovery in the new laender is conspicuous, said Stihl. 
Stihl expects an 8-percent economic growth in the new laender 
in 1994, but admits that this rosy prospect will continue to be 
dimmed by the high level of unemployment. Even so, there is no 
reason to panic, said Stihl. We can do without state employment 
programs just as we can do without horror scenes from the days 
of the Weimar Republic, he said. 
  Stihl denied that German industry had overlooked scientific 
progress, but admitted that cooperation between science and 
industry could be improved. He also indicated the decreasing 
percentage of exports out of the GNP. In 1989, exports took up 
32 percent of the GNP, but today they take up a mere 22 percent. 
Therefore it is important to boost exports, said Stihl.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutz Beukert and Peter Heinacher: "Little Hope </F>
for Net Reduction of Taxes on Companies"] 
  [Excerpts] Hannover -- With their demand for a 7.5-percent 
allowance on equipment investments, the Gesamtmetall employers' 
association and the IG-Metall trade union are quite alone. At 
the 1994 HANDELSBLATT economic forum on the occasion of the 
Hannover fair, which was held under the heading "Ways Out of the 
Crisis," the demand met with rejection by FRG Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany); Wolfgang 
Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union Bundestag group; and Saarland Minister President 
Oskar Lafontaine (Social Democratic Party of Germany); 
Federation of German Industry [BDI] President Tyll Necker; and 
Eberhard von Koerber, chairman of the Asea Brown Boveri AG board 
of directors. IG-Metall Chief Klaus Zwickel announced that in 
the 1995 wage negotiations the working people cannot be expected 
to accept any further losses in income. 
  FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt objected to the 
demands of Gesamtmetall and IG-Metall with particular vehemence. 
"We are already very intensively subsidizing investments, in 
particular those of small and medium-sized companies." There 
subsidies are appropriate for structural reasons. They are 
based on the idea that these companies function as an engine for 
the overall economy. "However, if a general allowance for 
investments is under discussion, I clearly say no." 
  In Rexrodt's view, an investment allowance would require an 
extended period to have any effect at all. At the moment there 
is the danger that the companies would adopt a wait-and-see 
attitude. It is very likely that already existing plans for 
investments would be relegated to the back burner. For this 
reason the demanded investment allowance would have a 
counterproductive effect at the moment. [passage omitted] 
  Rexrodt admitted that, despite the economic upswing, 
considerable problems on the labor market are still to be 
expected in 1994. This development is, however, primarily due 
to structural problems. Among the positive factors of the 
economic development is the fact that the inflation rate is 
declining and that the interest level in Germany is at a 
historically low level, Rexrodt added. Foreign orders are 
rising, and the minister also believes that a slight recovery 
can be felt regarding domestic demand. "The situation is more 
favorable than many people predicted just a few weeks ago." 
  BDI President Tyll Necker compared the economic development 
with a multistage rocket. The first stage, which is foreign 
demand, has been sparked, the second state, which is domestic 
demand for investments, is not yet working with full thrust. 
Only in individual fields some improvement can be seen, Necker 
noted. There are not yet any positive effects on consumption 
and on the creation of new jobs, which used to improve only 
later in all economic cycles of the past, too. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Death and Silence"] </F>
  [Text] Cynical reason is asking: Why does Gorazde not 
surrender? After all, the white flag might at least put an end 
to the slaughtering and the further escalation of the 
inconceivable. Sometimes capitulation really is the last resort. 
But the wild attack on Gorazde by the Serbs cannot be compared 
with a "normal" war, and this shows the barbarism to which 
"civilized" Europe is in danger of falling victim. 
  In the 18th century, there was a well-contrived war code 
that 
said: After so many hits, the commander of the fortress or city 
may honorably surrender, whereupon the conquerors march into the 
city with proper respect. Even in World War II, the "most 
total" of all wars, the right of capitulation was more or less 
respected -- see Rome or Paris. But Gorazde? Not capitulation 
that is followed by mercy, but destruction and expulsion are at 
issue. 
  No other signal is given by the offensive, which will have 
soon lasted for three weeks and which does not even refrain from 
well-aimed shots at hospitals. The conquest of a strategic point 
is not at issue; the city is to be emptied as much as possible 
by murders and escape so it will become "Muslim-free." The 
people know this and that is why they are fighting so 
desperately for every meter. Capitulation does not promise mercy 
to them, but terror and death. 
  What follows from it for the rest of the world? The 
so-called world community must understand that civilians are not 
murdered here by chance, but "purposefully." It must understand 
that unrestrained meanness in the form of Serbian tanks has 
driven the moral duty to the foreground of all considerations, 
no matter how weighty the strategic and political arguments 
against intervention are. For: He who does not prevent murder, 
although he could do so at justifiable risks, becomes guilty. 
  And yet the "world community" seems to watch the horror as 
if 
in a trance. The latest Security Council resolution -- the 
Serbian gentlemen should withdraw from Gorazde -- must have made 
them laugh. For weeks NATO has been silent. And the Americans, 
who are playing the key role now as ever, are indulging in hints 
like in oracles, which everybody may interpret to his liking. 
Of course, the Germans must be the last to mock at that. For 
in 1991, they pursued the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia by 
using their elbows, while being comfortably aware that they -- 
protected by the self-imposed constitutional tie -- would not 
have to bear any responsibility. 
  Since yesterday, Clinton's zigzag course has been pointing 
again to the preparedness to use force: NATO is to threaten 
with bombs in order to force the Serbs to withdraw heavy 
weaponry from the surroundings of the six protection zones. Can 
this intimidate the Serbs once more after their unhindered march 
to Gorazde? Sam Nunn, a powerful figure in the U.S. Senate, is 
right: "Pinpricks will not work any longer. We have to be 
prepared for escalation" -- if necessary, to Serbia. 
  That is the way it is; this is the price of the disgraceful 
silence for three weeks. Those who shrink from the necessary in 
time will finally only have the alternative between even more 
violence and the white flag. The Serbs' call for subjugation is 
also aimed at the West.

  [Excerpt] A National Alliance-Italian Social Movement 
delegation led by Gianfranco Fini told the president that Forza 
Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi should head the next government. 
Fini hoped that Berlusconi would not invoke Article 92 of the 
Constitution and independently choose his ministerial team. He 
added that if Berlusconi were asked to form the government he 
would be able to offer complete guarantees for avoiding a 
conflict of interest, perhaps via a guarantor. Fini said he was 
sure that the government would have the Senate's confidence.

<F P=106> [APA report: "Neofascists' Call for Osimo Revision Alarms </F>
SVP"] 
  [Text] Bolzano/Rome/Vienna -- The demands of Italy's 
neo-fascists for a revision of the Osimo Treaty, which sets down 
the Italian-Slovene border, has given rise to great concern in 
South Tirol. Siegfried Brugger, chairman of the South Tirolean 
People's Party (SVP), said during the weekend that the behavior 
of the neo-fascists gives "reason for concern, particularly in 
South Tirol and in Europe." The rightist "Union for South 
Tirol" has already come out in favor of "preparing a revision of 
the unjust border at the Brenner." 
  Next Thursday [28 April], the SVP leaders will meet with 
Foreign Minister Alois Mock in Vienna to discuss potential steps 
to be taken by the "protective power" Austria. Mock has come 
out in favor of watching the development in Italy with great 
attention. The SVP sees South Tirol's autonomy increasingly 
threatened as a result of statements from circles of the Italian 
rightist alliance. 
  According to a report by the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA, in 
summer 1991, shortly after the crumbling of Yugoslavia, 
neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini sounded out potential Serb 
reaction in Belgrade to Italy's efforts for a revision of the 
Osimo Treaty and a return of Istria to Italy. Renowned Serbian 
politicians more or less gave Fini the go-ahead at that time. 
  After a talk with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in the 
course of the consultations about the forming of a new 
government, Fini stressed that the point is "a revision of the 
treaties of Osimo, not of the borders." The new Italian 
Government is to strive for corresponding negotiations with the 
governments in Zagreb and Ljubljana, Fini said. 
  The party's foreign policy spokesman, Mirko Tremaglia, and 
another prominent politician, Roberto Menia, have justified the 
demand for a new negotiation of the treaties of Osimo by saying 
that these treaties were concluded in 1975 with the state of 
Yugoslavia, which no longer exists. In their view, Slovenia and 
Croatia are not automatically Yugoslavia's legal successors.

<F P=106> [Report by "m.t.l.": "Italian Social Movement Attacks </F>
`Nullified Osimo'"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- There is uncertainty and concern among 
the forces of the majority and accusations of "irresponsibility" 
from the opposition. Mirko Tremaglia's loud remarks about the 
"nullification" of the Osimo Treaty and the review of the 
eastern borders caused a bit of a storm. [passage omitted] 
  On Wednesday [27 April], the European Commission will 
discuss 
the framework within which the negotiations for Slovenia's 
association are to be approached. This is only the beginning of 
the procedure, but Tremaglia took the opportunity to ask that: 
1) the government intervene vis-a-vis the Italian commissioners 
in Brussels; 2) Osimo be rediscussed, including the borders 
issue. 
  "I believe that the move from historic revisionism to border 
revisionism is a particularly harmful game of chance," said 
Beniamino Andreatta, who yesterday handed over the job of 
foreign minister to Leopoldo Elia. "Revisionism concerning 
Italy's eastern borders also includes an inducement for 
revisionism concerning the eastern borders of Germany. My line 
has been to accelerate the process of integrating Central Europe 
into the European Union. To now put ourselves forward like the 
bandits of Radicofani [medieval border between Grand Duchy of 
Tuscany, Papal States] laying in wait for Slovenia's passage 
into Europe seems to me to be a little rough." 
  [Correspondent] However, you too made it understood that 
Italian consent... 
  [Andreatta] I too used the European prospect to induce 
Slovenia to abandon its protectionist laws. However, trying to 
link the revision of borders to the question of our veto, which 
is technically possible, means condemning Italy to complete 
isolation. Italy would then become a sort of Greece, which has a 
problem with Macedonia that no one understands. 
  [Correspondent] What would you propose for the immediate 
situation? 
  [Andreatta] I think that the European Commission's attention 
could be drawn to the fact that negotiations are under way 
(between Italy and Slovenia -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note), and 
it could ask the parties to reach a conclusion, especially one 
which respects minorities. However, these are people who want 
to show that they have arrived, and so they now have to make a 
big fuss. I wonder whether Europe can survive the arrival on 
the scene of new parties which do not have the patience or sense 
to make compromises on the foundations upon which Europe is 
built. [Andreatta ends] 
  The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has also attacked the 
proposal with the person responsible for foreign affairs, Piero 
Fassino ("the right has thrown down the mask") and with 
Secretary Achille Occhetto, according to whom Tremaglia's 
proposals are "evidence of just how irresponsible this majority 
is." 
  There are also problems within the alliance. Forza Italia's 
official for foreign affairs, Livio Caputo, is putting a hold on 
the border issue and reiterating the need to have the matter 
"tackled together vis-a-vis the Community partners." 
  League floor leader Roberto Maroni played down the matter: 
"This is an issue that does not concern me." 
  [Correspondent] However, your allies have talked about it. 
  [Maroni] The question of government action is not being 
raised. Everyone is free to think what they want. There are 
those who support Inter and those who support Milan [soccer 
teams]. Within five or 10 years we will have the Europe of 
regions, and the border issue will be irrelevant. [Maroni ends] 
  However, the "critical League member," Franco Rocchetta, 
feels that the Osimo Treaty "must surely be revised, since it 
was drafted when Italy was in a period of psychological and 
political subjection." What about borders? "Any border can be 
changed, even though the price is always high or extremely 
high." Decidedly critical, Marco Taradash (of the Pannella 
List) said: "Any desire to review borders is an anachronism." 
As for the veto, "the decision will have to be entrusted to the 
next foreign minister and left up to his discretion."

<F P=106> [Interview with Luciano Violante, Italian Democratic Party </F>
of the Left lower house deputy speaker, by "F.L.S."; place and 
date not given -- first paragraph is L'INFORMAZIONE introduction] 
  [Text] Yesterday Luciano Violante, PDS [Democratic Party of 
the Left] member and former magistrate, elected to the Chamber 
of Deputies in the fifth legislature, became one of the new 
deputy speakers at Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies]. 
  [Correspondent] You are well aware that you are among those 
whom your opponents love the least. Is your election a "slap in 
the face" to the majority? 
  [Violante] As a lower house deputy speaker, it is not my 
task 
to lead or manage the opposition, but to cooperate with the 
house speaker for institutional reasons. In this transitional 
stage in politics, the institutions must be solid. If they are 
rickety, the transition may become painful, and it may become 
harmful too. 
  [Correspondent] What is your opinion of the new speaker 
[Irene Pivetti]? 
  [Violante] I spoke to her for the first time when she was 
elected. Yesterday morning, before the election of the 
speaker's office staff, I went to pay my respects to her, as is 
my duty. The chosen speaker is the speaker of the house as a 
whole, and thereby loses any partisan characteristics. I am 
sure that Deputy Pivetti also will fulfill this role. 
  [Correspondent] Let us speak of the progressives. There is a 
great turmoil at grassroots level, a powerful thrust toward 
unity.... 
  [Violante] New developments are taking place within the 
Left. 
The challenge lies in whether we will be able to keep pace with 
them, so as to channel them into a government proposal. Two 
days ago, in the Chamber of Deputies, the great majority of the 
progressives elected a cultured man with political experience, 
but one who is certainly a newcomer, as their floor leader: 
Luigi Berlinguer. 
  [Correspondent] The parties are misfiring. Do you think that 
the parliamentary group will become the leading center of 
progressive politics? 
  [Violante] I believe that parliament will become a leading 
center of progressive politics, but not the only one. There is 
the problem of building progressive politics, as well as the 
problem of social opposition, which must be tackled by the 
parties. We must also wage a great cultural battle. The Right 
waged such a cultural battle, and it won because it was able to 
convey its views into public opinion. 
  [Correspondent] You do not often speak of your own party, 
the 
PDS. A great debate is now taking place on the leadership. 
What do you make of it? 
  [Violante] I believe that there are no leaders appointed in 
heaven. Besides, look at developments. The country's 
leadership has been taken over by a force that did not even 
exist three months ago. There are many in the PDS who are 
qualified to take over the leadership. But the real problem 
within the PDS lies in building a leading group which, overall, 
can respond to the pressing need for novelty. A secretary who 
cannot rely on a good leading group can do very little on his 
own. This problem is also apparent at the local federation 
level. I see an extraordinary potential, for example, in the 
Left's youth. 
  [Correspondent] Does leadership of the PDS mean the same 
thing as progressive leadership? 
  [Violante] No. They are not one and the same thing today. 
And I believe that they will not be for a long time to come, 
not until we can build a progressive party for government. The 
PDS should not pose the leadership problem in terms of the 
leadership of the progressive coalition as a whole. They are 
two different things. 
  [Correspondent] Like [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS 
Deputy 
Secretary] D'Alema.... 
  [Violante] The congress will be held in the fall. We must 
promote a great, honest, and serious debate. It would be 
ruinous to reduce this to a choice between two people, to a 
problem of succession to the leadership.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Progressive Forces Seek New Man for </F>
`Return Match'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The official watchword at PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] headquarters is definite: Occhetto's 
leadership is not in question within the PDS. The top leaders 
say so by implication, and the party leader himself said so 
forcefully at a Directorate meeting. But after the election 
defeat the debate on the pros and cons of a change of leadership 
for the major party of the progressive alignment is enlivening 
the debate between the various tendencies within the Left. It 
is even challenging the assumption that the leader of the 
"return match" against the Right, victorious in the 28 March 
elections, must necessarily be of communist extraction. Even 
within the PDS there are growing signs of a situation in flux. 
It is unanimously agreed that the process is bound to 
accelerate after the European elections in June, which demand a 
cautious attitude on everyone's part. It is only then that we 
will see the start of the debate leading up to the congress in 
the fall, clarifying the intentions of the various protagonists, 
who are now busy mainly with examining what is to be done, 
without revealing their respective hands. 
  Against the background of the now almost proverbial rivalry 
between Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, a conflict 
over policy line is emerging, based essentially on the choice 
between, on the one hand, "renewal" and the "stability" of the 
leadership and, on the other, the problem of the PDS' new role. 
It is the basic substance of the debate between those aiming at 
a dissolution with a view to the establishment of the 
"democratic party" and those, on the other hand, who insist on a 
"strong relationship" with the center by an organizationally 
autonomous Left -- two stances that seem to be represented by 
[L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni and Massimo D'Alema, 
respectively. 
  Significantly, a rapid opinion poll conducted by LA 
REPUBBLICA yesterday among some 40 progressive deputies and 
senators indicates the editor of L'UNITA and the former PDS 
lower house speaker as the two favorite candidates for the 
leadership of the alignment, out of a choice that also includes 
figures from outside the PDS, such as former Deputy Stefano 
Rodota, Mayor of Rome Franco Rutelli, Socialist Valdo Spini, and 
Mayor of Venice Massimo Cacciari. One- third of those 
interviewed expressed no preference, but three-fourths of the 
sample seemed convinced that a change of guard is essential. If 
the same opinion were to become current within the PDS itself, 
the fall congress could indeed prove to be Occhetto's last as 
secretary.

  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, who is in 
Brazil attending the meeting of the European Union and the Rio 
Group, has now given a first assessment of the latest NATO 
ultimatum. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes: 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] For Javier Solana, this ultimatum from 
the Atlantic alliance is the one that was expected following the 
international community's frustrating experience in Gorazde in 
recent days and after the repeated cease-fire violations by the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  [Begin Solana recording] I think that we have -- I don't 
think that we have, I am certain that we have -- the obligation 
to send a clear message to the parties in conflict, basically to 
the Serbs, that the zones that have been declared safe and 
defensible by the UN will be defended. A decision will not be 
the only one or the last one. I think that in the coming hours 
there will certainly be further resolutions, which will take 
measures in relation to other enclaves, other zones protected by 
the UN, so that a situation like the one that has occurred in 
Gorazde cannot be repeated. [end recording] 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] Although the same conceptual approach 
exists among the member countries of the Atlantic alliance, 
Minister Solana believes this further resolution may be delayed 
a little longer because of the difficulties of a technical 
nature, which have to be overcome. Although he has not been 
able to contact his Russian opposite number, Javier Solana is 
convinced that, if NATO carries out the strikes to defend 
Gorazde, the complaints of the Russian Government will not be 
repeated on this occasion: 
  [Begin Solana recording] My impression is that the Russian 
political and military leaders agree with this approach. What 
they must do is the same thing that they did in the case of 
Sarajevo: try to get the Serbs...[pauses] Pressure them to 
comply so that this resolution does not have to be implemented. 
But if they do not comply, without any doubt whatsover, it will 
be implemented. [end recording]

  [Text] Several Western embassies have decided to evacuate 
their nationals from Serbia and Montenegro (Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia) as a precaution against Serb positions in Gorazde 
being bombed in the next few hours and the possibility of 
reprisals. The United States, Great Britain, and France, whose 
aircraft could take part directly in the bombing, have already 
started the evacuation of Belgrade. As for the families of the 
diplomatic staff and employees of the Spanish mission in 
Belgrade -- a total of about 16 people -- only four of them have 
decided to leave the country, following the advice of the 
Spanish Government. As for the Spanish population of Serbia and 
Montenegro -- according to diplomatic sources, about 50 people, 
mostly the wives or children of Serbs -- they have said that 
they do not feel threatened at present and are not considering 
evacuation.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Neste's Natural Gas Unit To </F>
Become Gasum -- One-Fourth of the Firm Will Be Russian Owned"] 
  [Text] The Russian gas company Gasprom is paying about 250 
million markkas for a 25-percent interest in Neste's natural gas 
unit. The agreement giving Gasprom one-fourth of the natural gas 
unit, which will be incorporated at the same time under the name 
Gasum, was signed on Saturday [12 March] while Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was visiting Neste. An agreement on 
increased gas imports from Russia was signed at the same time. 
  Imatran Voima [IVO], the other state-owned energy company, 
also signed an energy agreement with Russia on Saturday. IVO 
signed a framework agreement to modernize and improve a total of 
16 thermal power plants and their related district heating 
systems in the area around St. Petersburg. The agreement calls 
for work worth close to 1 billion markkas. 
  The Russian gas company Gasprom is the world's largest 
producer of natural gas, and it has already bought shares in 
other Western gas companies -- in Germany, for example. 
Gasprom's purchase of Neste's natural gas unit is completely in 
line with the concept governing the firm's activities in the 
rest of the world, says Rem Vyahirev, Gasprom's chief manager. 
  The Gasum Corporation will begin its activity on 1 May this 
year and will operate as a subsidiary of the Neste Group. Plans 
also call for listing Gasum on the stock exchange, but that will 
not happen for at least a year -- after the company has produced 
its first balance sheet, says Neste President Jaakko Ihamuotila. 
  Gasum's balance sheet will total about 2.5 billion markkas, 
and its capital stock will amount to 40 percent of that amount, 
or about 1 billion markkas. Gasprom is therefore subscribing to 
25 percent of the stock. 
  Gasprom became a part owner of Gasum at Neste's initiative, 
says Ihamuotila, who says the fact that the gas supplier is also 
a partner in the sales and distribution firm represents a 
strengthening of the Finnish natural gas market. 
  "It guarantees us an uninterrupted supply of gas," said 
Ihamuotila, who pointed out at the same time that guaranteed 
deliveries have never been a problem in the past either. 
<H5>  New Transport Capacity </H5>
  Ihamuotila predicts that by the turn of the century, natural 
gas consumption in Finland will have increased 50 percent over 
its current level of just over 3 billion cubic meters per year. 
Under the import agreement signed on Saturday, imports from 
Russia will rise to just above 4 billion cubic meters per year 
over a 20-year period. 
  Increased imports mean that transport capacity from Russia 
and within Finland will also increase: A new compressor station 
north of St. Petersburg and a parallel pipeline from there to 
the Finnish border are planned. Planning is also under way for a 
parallel pipeline between Imatra and Lappeenranta and from the 
latter locality to Kouvola and Mantsala. 
<H5>  Door Open to Norway </H5>
  Neste estimates that Finland's annual natural gas 
requirement 
could rise to nearly 8 billion cubic meters per year if the 
Finnish gas pipeline is extended to the west coast and if 
natural gas is also used to produce electricity. An option on 
further imports from Russia is included in the agreement signed 
on Saturday, but Neste also wants to keep the door open for gas 
imports from Norway. The Finnish Government also says that a 
second source of natural gas is necessary if the gas network is 
to be expanded. 
  The Russian interest in Neste's Gasum does not markedly 
alter 
the Nordic gas picture. Both Finland and Norway are still 
waiting for Sweden to reach a decision on natural gas so they 
will know whether a pipeline can be built to Sweden's Uppland 
coast. That pipeline would then link up with the pipeline being 
extended to Uusikaupunki on the Finnish side. 
  No political decision is expected in Sweden before this 
fall's election, but Swedish industry may very well take the 
initiative in introducing natural gas imports from Norway. 
Industry wants to ensure its supply of energy even if Sweden 
goes ahead with plans to phase out nuclear power. 
  A Nordic gas pipeline would also suit Gasprom and the export 
firm Gasexport because it would open up the possibility of 
exporting Russian gas to Sweden as well. 
  The Norwegians and the Finns are both hoping for a 
relatively 
quick decision by the Swedes. The Norwegians must decide whether 
to extend their gas pipelines further south in the direction of 
Central Europe, where there is a big market. For their part, the 
towns on Finland's west coast, which are potentially big gas 
consumers, will soon have to make decisions about their future 
energy supplies. 
  The increased quantities of Russian gas that Neste agreed to 
on Saturday will be used mainly by combined power and district 
heating plants, where they will replace coal as an energy source. 
  Gasprom, which was formerly a state-owned Russian firm, is 
now a corporation in the process of being privatized. Some of 
the stock has been sold to employees, and some has been bought 
by the regional gas companies that all deliver their gas through 
Gasprom. Last year nearly 100 billion cubic meters of gas were 
exported, and the company plans to increase its exports beyond 
that. 
<H5>  IVO To Be Paid in Coal and Oil </H5>
  For its part, the agreement that Imatran Voima signed on 
Saturday to modernize Russian power plants will improve energy 
efficiency and reduce effluent at power plants in our near 
vicinity. IVO had previously participated in mapping out the 
possibilities for modernizing power plants in neighboring areas. 
  "Financing is always a tough problem, and we are doing what 
we can to help find alternative forms of payment," says IVO Vice 
President Anders Palmgren. Under the terms of Saturday's 
agreement, the Russian partner will pay for the modernization of 
the power plants using the energy raw material that is saved as 
a result of that modernization, meaning primarily oil or coal. 
The projects will also be paid for partly in electricity 
exports. Palmgren says that exchange or barter arrangements of 
many different kinds may be considered. 
  IVO's agreement to import electricity from Russia through 
the 
end of the century is not affected by Saturday's agreement. 
Palmgren says that a possible extension of that agreement will 
not be discussed before 1997.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russian Trade Revives"] </F>
  [Text] Over half of Finland's imports from Russia still 
consist of some form of energy, according to the Customs 
Department's trade statistics for last year. 
  Trade between Finland and Russia last year again rose above 
its 1991 level, and Finnish exports to the East consisted mainly 
of machinery, equipment, and means of transportation. Those 
exports exceeded 6 billion markkas in value and accounted for a 
total of 4.5 percent of our foreign trade. For its part, the 
value of Finnish imports from Russia was close to 8 billion 
markkas. 
  Exports of machinery and equipment to Russia were twice what 
they were the year before, accounting in total for nearly half 
of Finnish exports. The most important single export items were 
telephone and radio sets. 
  Food exports to Russia tripled last year, and one-fourth of 
all Finnish food exports go to Russia. Beverage and food exports 
exceeded 1 billion markkas last year, and nearly one-fifth of 
those exports consisted of fruit and vegetables. 
  The slowest growth last year was recorded by the textile and 
garment industry. Clothing purchases for Russia totaled just 
over 120 million markkas, while shoes accounted for nearly 110 
million markkas. 
  Energy continues to dominate Finnish imports from Russia, 
although petroleum quantities are below the levels achieved 
during the peak years in the late 1980's. Petroleum imports last 
year were at the same level as in 1992: approximately 3 billion 
metric tons, or about one-third of total imports. 
  Imports of natural gas have increased and account for 
one-fifth of total imports, while coal stands just under 5 
percent and direct electric current accounts for nearly 10 
percent of imports. Timber accounts for over 10 percent of total 
imports. Timber imports, mostly in the form of logs, are rising 
steadily.

  [Excerpt] The Swedish Government is presenting a bill on a 
national referendum on the European Union [EU]. The bill 
formulates the question to which the Swedes will answer yes or 
no on 13 November. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The question is: Are you of the 
opinion that Sweden should become a member of the EU in 
accordance with the agreement between Sweden and the EU member 
states? The answer can only be yes or no but it is possible to 
leave a blank ballot paper. This is a consultative referendum 
for Swedish citizens only. 
  The national referendum is expected to cost almost 125 
million Swedish kronor, which is what it costs for the Swedish 
National Tax Board to print ballot papers and to carry out the 
actual balloting. If there are any extra costs for the 
municipalities, they will have to pay for that themselves. 
  In addition, there will be an appropriation of 60 million 
Swedish kronor as campaign money: Twelve million Swedish kronor 
will be divided between the parliamentary parties, and the rest 
will be divided evenly between the pro-EU and anti-EU 
organizations. Then there is also a further 21 million Swedish 
kronor in information costs. At the same time that the Swedish 
National Tax Board sends ballot papers to all Swedish citizens 
there will also be a 12-page information leaflet on what the 
agreement with the EU means. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with Olof Johansson, environment </F>
minister and Center Party leader, and Dan Ericsson, Christian 
Democratic Party secretary, by Elisabeth Crona and Anita Kratz: 
"Center Party Would Remain in Government Despite a No to the 
EU"] 
  [Text] "If our party congress says no to the EU [European 
Union], we Center Party ministers will tender our resignations. 
Then it will be up to Prime Minister Carl Bildt to decide if we 
should go or whether we can put our divergent view on record." 
  Olof Johansson, environment minister and Center Party 
leader, 
has his strategy clear. This was apparent in an interview with 
SVENSKA DAGBLADET. 
  [Johansson] I have the biggest responsibility to the party 
conference. I have not yet discussed in the circle of ministers 
what a no will mean for our actions in the government. But I 
did think the thing through carefully when we joined the 
government. 
  We might be offered the possibility of putting our 
reservations on record. In the event of a no to the EU, the 
question whether we should do that or resign raises its head. 
  This is something the prime minister must decide. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But could you stay and be opposed to one 
of the cornerstones of the government declaration -- membership 
of the EU? 
  [Johansson] The question is no longer quite so important 
because it is to be decided in a referendum, after the Riksdag 
election. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The possibility of a government party 
expressing its reservations on an issue where it takes a 
divergent view was brought back onto the agenda in connection 
with the conflict surrounding the Oresund bridge -- an issue 
which will soon be back on the government's desk. Now Olof 
Johansson is pointing to the same possible solution in the even 
of an EU no from the Center Party. 
  The Center Party leader has taken part in four local party 
meetings. 
  How do you see the outcome of the extraordinary party 
congress vote on the EU, now that the local party organizations 
have had their say? 
  [Johansson] Reporting is loudest when the answer is a no.... 
But I believe that we will see the same positions as at past 
party congresses -- only a little clearer. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] However, Olof Johansson expects that now 
that the question is being brought to a head, uncertain 
delegates could slip over onto the no side. 
  Has the result of the negotiations influenced Center Party 
opinion in the direction of a yes? 
  [Johansson] I myself have not drawn attention particularly 
strongly to the result from the negotiations. But I think that 
it can give greater credibility. It is important that people do 
not undermine this result here at home by implementing spending 
cuts in the national support for agriculture and regional policy. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The Center Party's government colleagues 
are cautious when it comes to drawing any conclusions about 
continued government cooperation, before the party's congress 
has reached a decision. 
  Christian Democratic Party [KDS] secretary Dan Ericsson said 
that up to now the government has been united in working for 
membership. 
  [Ericsson] And Center Party ministers in particular have 
worked to achieve a good agreement with the EU countries. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] During the membership negotiations, the 
Center Party's ministers were responsible for some of the most 
heavyweight areas -- the environment, agriculture, and regional 
policy. 
  Dan Ericsson is amazed that Olof Johansson is thinking in 
terms of resignations. 
  [Ericsson] A remarkable situation is arising. The Center 
Party is not itself coming to a decision about the continued 
existence of the government. It is leaving it to the government 
head to think about what should happen if the government 
suddenly contains a party that argues against membership. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] KDS sympathizers are just as divided in 
their attitudes to the EU as Center Party voters and Social 
Democrats. But the party leadership has methodically worked for 
a yes. At the three most recent KDS national conferences, the 
party's active members have voted for Swedish membership. 
  Dan Ericsson pointed out that Christian Democrats elsewhere 
in Europe have been in favor of a European community ever since 
the creation of the coal and steel union, the first step toward 
what today is the EU. 
  Moderate Coalition Party secretary Gunnar Hokmark takes a 
much more wait-and-see approach than Dan Ericsson. 
  [Ericsson] We are assuming that the Center Party will follow 
in full the policy we agree on in government cooperation. If 
something different happens, we will have to reach a decision 
then. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Hokmark stressed that the ultimate goal 
of Swedish membership has been part of the package ever since 
the nonsocialist four-party government's first government 
declaration in the fall of 1991. In it Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt (Moderate Coalition Party) said that the first major task 
"is to lead Sweden fully into European cooperation through 
negotiations on membership of the European Community." 
  Liberal Party secretary Peter Orn was unwilling to comment 
on 
the Center Party's internal processes. "They must be allowed to 
see to them in peace. I have always disliked the way Carl Bildt 
has attacked the Social Democrats because they have not yet 
reached a decision on EU membership." 
  Sten Olsson, the opposition Social Democrats' assistant 
party 
secretary, thinks that a situation in which a government's 
composition can remain the same if Center Party delegates vote 
no to the EU is difficult to reconcile with Sweden's 
parliamentary principles; Swedish ministers have a collective 
responsibility for the work of the whole government. 
  "It is the same debate as the debate about the Oresund 
bridge. Can the government reserve judgment on a question of 
such central importance?" Sten Olsson asked, answering his own 
question by saying that this is hardly possible because of the 
demand for joint responsibility. 
  For his own part he is happy with the way the Social 
Democrats have handled the EU question -- the Social Democratic 
leadership has come out in favor of membership. On 18-19 June 
the adjourned congress will then recommend to to voters whether 
to vote yes or no. 
  "If we receive the support needed to form a government in 
the 
election in September we will already have put our cards on the 
table on the EU question," Sten Olsson said, adding that as a 
result the party does not find itself in the same boat as the 
current government.

<F P=106> [Thomas Dietl report: "Ericsson Leads the Patents League"] </F>
  [Text] The telecommunications company Ericsson ranks number 
one in DAGENS INDUSTRI's Patents Index for the last two 
quarters. This is not surprising, since the company has 
invested 10.9 billion kronor [SKr], i.e., 17 percent of its 1993 
sales figures, in research and development. This result was not 
beaten even by research-intensive pharmaceutical companies. 
  But Ericsson is not uncontested in the Swedish top league. 
Sandvik AB performed best during the first three months of the 
year. Sandvik has more published patents applications than any 
other Swedish enterprise and this ensures the company a 
continued strong position in future index ratings. 
  Ericsson has for some years maintained a clear strategy, 
filing patent applications in a more active and well-prepared 
manner. This is where Erling Blomme, the company's legal 
executive, plays an important role. He is in charge of the way 
the corporation handles its patents. 
  Erling Blomme maintains that since the 1980's Ericsson has 
been placing an increasing emphasis on protecting itself through 
patents. The results show in a gradual increase of the number of 
patents granted. In the first index published by DAGENS 
INDUSTRI in October 1993, Ericsson scored 22 patents granted. 
By the next quarter, this figure had grown to 27. The latest 
patent index shows 28 patents between October 1993 and the end 
of March 1994. 
  Japanese telecommunications companies have not caused 
Ericsson any problems in the area of patents. The Japanese are 
known for their "lightning-fast" action to secure important key 
patents by patenting all surrounding applications. But these 
obstructive patents make it impossible for the original 
constructor to apply his design without infringing his own 
patent infringements. 
  "On the other hand, we have become aware of new operators in 
the West," Erling Blomme said. 
  "For instance, there are U.S. companies with a patents 
portfolio as their only asset and source of income." 
  The U.S. telecommunications company AT&amp;T ran into 
difficulties with a "patents company" that attacked all 
telephone exchange suppliers on the U.S. market, including 
Ericsson, which got its share of problems. The patents company 
succeeded in obtaining a SKr280-million settlement from AT&amp;T 
the 
first time the issue went to court. 
  Last fall Ericsson was summoned to court in the United 
States 
by the U.S. telecommunications company IDC. The U.S. company 
alleged that Ericsson had, among other things, violated an 
important subpatent within the new digital standard for mobile 
telecommunications. Ericsson responded with a countersummons, 
claiming that the patents of IDC are invalid. 
  "We have managed quite well on the U.S. market so far," 
Erling Blomme said.

  [Text] Nicosia, Apr 23 (CNA)--The Cyprus Government 
welcomed with skepticism a statement by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, who expressed the hope that there would be some 
movement from the Turkish side on Cyprus in the next couple of 
days with regard to the U.N.-proposed package of 
confidence-building measures (CBM'S). 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kassoulidhis told the Cyprus 
News Agency Saturday [23 April] that "really President Clinton 
has shown personal interest" in the efforts for a Cyprus 
settlement. 
  "He (Clinton) correctly noted that the ball has been in 
Denktas's court," the spokesman said. 
  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has so far refused to 
accept the U.N.-proposed CBM's package while President Glavkos 
Kliridhis has accepted it in principle since May 1993. 
  Spokesman Kassoulidhis said he would not make further 
comments "until we really see that Mr Denktas has accepted the 
21 March document" of the United Nations regarding the 
implementation of the CBM's 
  Asked "what about Cyprus" before his White House talks 
Friday 
with Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou, President Clinton 
said: 
  "We're working hard on Cyprus, and I think, I hope there 
will 
be some movement from the Turkish side on Cyprus in the next 
couple of days with regard to the confidence-building measures. 
I think that the ball has been sort of in Mr. Denktas's court, 
and I hope he will take it up, and then I hope that Greece and 
all others will support pushing forward. I have worked hard to 
resolve this since I've been in office, and I will continue to 
stay on it." 
  Speaking during a press conference after his talks with 
Premier Papandreou, the U.S. President said the U.S. "supports 
the U.N. confidence-building measures. Those measures grew out 
of discussions with President Kliridhis soon after he took 
office, and we hope that both sides will support them." 
  He said his coordinator for Cyprus Robert Lamb had just 
returned from talks with both sides. 
  He said "A settlement in Cyprus would benefit all the 
nations 
in the region, especially Greece and Turkey, two vital members 
of NATO." 
  President Clinton pledged to do what he can "to promote 
greater understanding between these two critical nations and, in 
the process, to promote progress on Cyprus." 
  Meanwhile, U.N envoys on Cyprus were due Saturday to start a 
new effort to try to convince the Turkish side to accept the 
CBM'S. 
  U.N. secretary-general's special representative Joe Clark 
was 
scheduled to meet Saturday in Washington Greece's Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias, who is accompanying premier 
Papandreou on his U.S. trip. 
  On Sunday, the former Canadian prime minister will fly to 
Ankara for talks with the Turkish Government. He will be joined 
in the Turkish capital by the U.N. chief's resident 
representative to Cyprus Gustave Feissel. 
  The U.N. envoys will come to Cyprus on Wednesday for talks 
with President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas. 
  Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops 
invaded and occupied 37 per cent of its territory. 
  Among the confidence-building measures proposed by the U.N. 
is the transfer of part of the Turkish-occupied town of 
Famagusta to the U.N. administration to allow some 16.000 Greek 
Cypriot refugees to return to their homes and the re-opening of 
the now defunct Nicosia International Airport.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, stressed that there must be safe 
access to and from Famagusta. Clark was speaking to Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] correspondent Apostolis 
Zoumbaniotis before meeting Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias in New York last night. 
  The UN official said the two sides are very close to an 
agreement but noted that there are still some pending issues. 
He said access to Famagusta is the most crucial one. Clark 
added that there must be real security on access to and from 
Famagusta both for residents and businessmen who will return to 
the area. 
  With his meeting with Papoulias, Clark opened a new round of 
meetings to reach an agreement on the confidence-building 
measures. He also met U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stephen 
Oxman and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue. Clark is expected to leave 
from Washington today to go to Ankara for talks with Turkish 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. He and Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, 
are expected in Cyprus next Wednesday [27 April]. 
  Accompanied by UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] Political 
Adviser John Paul Kavanagh, Feissel left for Ankara this 
morning. In a statement to CyBC, Feissel said he and Clark will 
hold two-day talks with Turkish officials in Ankara. He said: 
It is a new effort for a positive conclusion on the 
confidence-building measures in view of the new report that the 
UN secretary general will have to submit to the Security Council 
by the end of April. 
  Answering a question by CyBC correspondent Takis Andoniadhis 
in Nicosia on U.S. President Bill Clinton's position that 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas will accept the 
confidence-building measures, Feissel said he is not aware of 
the U.S. President's statement, adding: We must wait for the 
outcome of the new effort by the end of this week.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said that it is not 
only the question of access to Famagusta which constitutes an 
obstacle to agreement on implementing the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. There is a series of other questions, he 
noted, which the Turkish side keeps putting forward and which, 
if accepted, would lead to the pseudostate's recognition. 
President Kliridhis made this statement to journalists who 
visited him to greet him on his birthday today. 
  The president added that the Turks do not agree for 
Famagusta 
and the International Nicosia Airport to be placed under UN 
administration. The Turks, he added, insist that there must be 
a co-administration, not UN administration.

  [Text] Turkish State Minister Mehmet Ali Yilmaz concluded 
his contacts in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] 
and left the island today. 
  Speaking at a news conference before his departure at Ercan 
State Airport, Yilmaz said that during his stay he visited the 
investment projects in the TRNC and was briefed on them. He 
noted that the investments that continued in 1994 will be 
concluded in accordance with a time table. Pointing out that 
the greatest problem of the TRNC is the budget deficit, Yilmaz 
added that the Turkish government will try and solve this 
problem. He concluded by expressing his satisfaction over this 
first visit to the TRNC. 
  Prime Minister Hakki Atun said that Yilmaz's visit gave them 
the opportunity to brief the Turkish minister on the investments 
being made, adding that Turkish delegation was informed on the 
problems of the coalition government. He noted that the talks 
between Turkey and the TRNC were beneficial and that the Turkish 
side had a sincere approach to the problems of the Turkish 
cypriots. Atun concluded by thanking the delegation for their 
approach. 
  Atun, Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur, Turkish Ambassador 
to Lefkosa [Nicosia] Cahit Bayar, commander of the security 
forces, president of the supreme court, various ministers and

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has stressed that the 
confidence-building measures [CBM] package must be reversed to 
its original form. Mehmet Ali Yilmaz, Turkish state minister in 
charge of Cyprus affairs, paid a farewell visit on Denktas this 
morning. 
  Replying to reporters' questions after the meeting, Denktas 
said that there are promises made in the first version of the 
CBM package and recalled that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos 
Kliridhis accepted the package before it was changed. 
Explaining that the package was eliminated as a result of 
negotiations conducted subsequently, Denktas noted that 
Kliridhis acted as if he accepted the package although he 
actually had not. This was Kliridhis' tactics, Denktas remarked. 
  Denktas declared that the original package must be 
reinstated, adding that work can be conducted on this version.

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said he was 
especially satisfied with the outcome of his official talks with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. Athens News Agency reported today 
from Washington that after meeting U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes 
and U.S. Presidential Adviser George Stephanopoulos, the prime 
minister said he is optimistic about the issue of Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Papandreou 
stressed that many opposing forces operate in politics and no 
one can predict developments with certainty. 
  Papandreou added that in the United States he found a very 
warm welcome and support for Greece and noted that for the first 
time it was recognized that Greece has rights that are being 
violated. Discussing Greek-Turkish relations, the prime minister 
said that Washington is under the impression that the 
possibilities for positive Greek-Turkish relations are greater 
than we think. 
  In light of Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' meeting with 
international mediator Cyrus Vance in New York, U.S. 
Presidential envoy to Skopje Matthew Nimetz met Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis at the Greek 
Embassy. 
  The official part of Papandreou's visit to Washington 
concluded last night with a reception hosted by the Greek 
ambassador at the Embassy. The prime minister and his 
delegation will leave for New York today.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos commented 
in Thessaloniki today on the prime minister's [U.S.] visit. Our 
correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report. 
  [Begin recording] [Venizelos] I believe that the statement 
made by President Clinton to the journalists is satisfactory 
with regard to all the issues concerning us -- that is, 
primarily on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] issue, Greek-Albanian relations, the 
Patriarchate's position, and the prospects of the Cyprus issue. 
It is a significant fact that President Clinton recognizes the 
Greek sensitivities and, if you like, the soundness of the Greek 
position and that he attaches so much importance to Cyrus 
Vance's mission and that of Matthew Nimetz, who will be coming 
to supplement the Vance mission. 
  [Karzis] On Albania, Athens is waiting for the upcoming 
crucial Papoulias-Serreqi meeting while taking continuous steps 
to protect the Greek minority. 
  [Venizelos] The protection of the Greek minority's rights is 
a self-evident prerequisite, respect for international law and 
human rights is non-negotiable; and this, of course, concerns 
all the levels at which this issue is raised. 
  [Karzis] Concerning Greek-Turkish relations, Mr. Venizelos 
said that Greece must be sparing and careful when referring to 
Turkey's internal political problems. However, he pointed out 
that Ankara is trying to export these problems. 
  [Venizelos] What concerns us about the recent local 
elections 
in Turkey is that we hope there are no provocations, no 
violations of international law, and that the historic existence 
and international status of the Ecumenical Patriarchate is 
respected. [end recording]

  [Text] Opposition parties are waiting before they assess 
the Papandreou-Clinton meeting in the White House yesterday, 
while the left wing considers the results negative. 
  New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert said that the visit 
has been neutral--neither positive nor negative--and this has 
caused some optimism in the Greek delegation. Mr. Evert noted 
that we have received more pressure on the Bosnian and Turkish 
issues and that the Greek prime minister did not succeed in 
convincing the Americans to put pressure on Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. He added: I believe 
that tomorrow's meeting between Mr. Karolos Papoulias and Mr. 
Cyrus Vance will be important; we will see how the situation 
develops. Mr. Evert concluded: It is a colorless visit with 
compliments and nice speeches, but I have not as yet seen any 
results. 
  Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said: Despite the 
dangerous concessions and serious vagueness that appeared at 
yesterday's news conference, I would not like to make my 
positions known in public so long as the country's prime 
minister is abroad. I will wait for his return and his briefing 
of the opposition. Mr. Samaras concluded: The only thing I can 
say now is that I am deeply concerned. 
  Former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis made a 
statement today referring to the question of Skopje's name. He 
said: Nobody can deny that it is better to be named North 
Macedonia or New Macedonia rather than plain Macedonia. There 
is no doubt about this. As soon as Mitsotakis' statement became 
known, New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert responded: New 
Democracy's positions are known and firm. 
  The Greek Communist Party has assessed that the prime 
minister's visit to the United States marks and seals Greece's 
full submission to the U.S. aggressive and warlike policy in the 
Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. This policy aims at 
converting this region, at any cost, into a zone of U.S. 
interests and influence. 
  Commenting on the statements by the Greek prime minister and 
the U.S. President, the Coalition of the Left and of Progress 
Party points out, among other things, that excessive 
expectations are being cultivated once again about the 
development of our national issues for reasons of domestic 
consumption. Unfortunately, the party statement adds, Mr. 
Papandreou's belated pro-American turn continues to be based on 
self-illusions about the role and aims of the U.S. policy on the 
Balkans.

<F P=106> [The "Views" column: "Initial Appraisals"] </F>
  [Text] Given the hitherto negative, almost hostile, 
atmosphere and our fear of a lack of U.S. understanding of Greek 
affairs, we must conclude that rather positive results, as well 
as some other disturbing puzzles for the Cyprus issue and 
Greek-Turkish relations, have emerged from the talks between 
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. 
  It is positive that President Clinton recognized that 
Greece's concern over the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM] issue was justified, stressing that these 
concerns "have their roots in ancient and modern history." 
  It is positive that Clinton said "We are concerned about the 
Greek minority in Albania" and pointed out that Greece is 
addressing the problem "with wisdom and sound judgment." 
  It is positive that President Clinton expressed his interest 
in the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the Turkish prime minister. 
  It is positive that the road is open for Greek-U.S. economic 
cooperation aimed at their business infiltration into the 
Balkans. 
  This cooperation is backed-up by the U.S. with $1 billion, 
which shows their recognition of Greece's role in the region and 
its possibilities for peace initiatives. 
  It is not easy to appraise the practical results of these 
initially positive elements now because certainly things were 
said at the talks which were not announced at the joint news 
conference. 
  The Cyprus issue remains a puzzle as President Clinton 
referred to the mediator for its solution, and Andreas 
Papandreou merely said that there is "good news" about the 
promotion of the confidence-building measures. 
  Greek-Turkish affairs also remain a puzzle -- except for the 
Patriarchate issue. President Clinton expressed his wishes for 
Greek-Turkish cooperation; he pointed out the Turkish 
Government's concern over the increase of Islamism, and asked 
Greece to contribute to European assistance to Turkey and to 
cooperate with it. However, he did not say what Turkey, which 
constantly provokes Greece, should do. 
  At any rate, the meeting showed that there are grounds for 
further understanding and development of Greek-U.S. relations 
and, with all the necessary reservations, this is rather 
positive.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hopes From the Meeting"] </F>
  [Text] The meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou confirmed the positive 
atmosphere in our bilateral relations which might even affect 
pending issues in our national policy -- the Cyprus and Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issues. 
  Mr. Bill Clinton created expectations on the Greek side when 
he told journalists that there must be some changes in Skopje's 
views and when he gave assurances of his personal interest in 
the Cyprus issue, expressing the hope that there might be some 
movement by the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] in the next few days. 
  The U.S. interest in stability in the region should be 
considered obvious. It is also obvious that stability is not 
feasible unless there is relaxation in Greece's disputes with 
Turkey and the Republic of Skopje. Naturally, since all sides 
have declared their intentions to resolve their disputes through 
dialogue, any settlement that is reached can only be a 
compromise. 
  Concerning the Cyprus issue the Greek side, by accepting the 
proposals on the CBM's, has made further concessions and 
consequently Mr. Bill Clinton was right when talking about the 
need for a move by the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  Concerning the Skopje issue, Mr. Bill Clinton's statement 
that there should be changes in the views of the regime of the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of "Macedonia" acquires particular 
significance in view of the meeting between Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias and UN mediator Mr. Cyrus Vance. However, it 
would be a mistake to suppose that there has been no pressure on 
the Greek side too to lift economic countermeasures and achieve 
a compromise solution. 
  There are many who doubt that the United States really wants 
to intervene on the side of Greek national interest since our 
country's predicament involves states with which Washington 
either is closely allied, such as Turkey, or is now laying the 
foundations of cooperation, such as Albania and the Republic of 
Skopje. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. President's statement appears to lift 
the pessimistic atmosphere, but it remains to be seen whether 
Mr. Bill Clinton's interest will lead to concrete results in the 
issues of Cyprus and Skopje.

  [Text] The diplomatic staff of the Greek Embassy in Tirana 
will not leave. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today 
said that Albania is reexamining the measures taken to reduce 
the number of diplomatic staffers at the Greek Embassy. He 
added that, following this development, Greece will decide its 
stance on the issue after a meeting between the foreign 
ministers of the two countries on 3 May in Zurich. Six 
administrative staffers will be leaving the Greek Embassy in 
Tirana. It should be noted that the Greek Embassy in Tirana has 
19 people while the Albanian Embassy in Athens has only one 
administrative staffer out of a total of six people. 
  Replying to questions, the government spokesman said the 
Albanian Government obviously made these decisions after taking 
current developments into consideration. Venizelos also said 
that it should be considered self-explanatory that Mr. van der 
Stoel, as CSCE officer responsible for minority issues, is 
interested in the situation of the Greek minority in Albania. 
  A short while ago, our correspondent in Ioannina, Yeoryios 
Kirousis, reported that the Albanian authorities began releasing 
[from detention] officials of the Greek minority party, Omonoia. 
So far, the president and two members of Omonoia's chapter in 
Gjirokaster have not been released.

  [Excerpts] A few minutes ago National Economy Finance 
Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas died in the intensive care unit at 
Evangelismos Hospital. He was born in Athens in 1939. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yennimatas personally told the Greek people that he was 
suffering from cancer. He went to the United States for 
treatment and after a few weeks returned to Athens with obvious 
hope that he had surpassed the danger. His condition 
deteriorated and again he informed the people, this time telling 
them that the cancer had affected his liver. His wife, Kakia, 
died of cancer a few months ago.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that 
according to the latest reports, a cease-fire was secured in 
Gorazde last night and the Serbs agreed to withdraw as of this 
morning. Cetin added that all Serbian forces are expected to 
withdraw from Gorazde by noon today. Cetin made this statement 
at Ankara's Esenboga Airport before leaving for talks in 
Azerbaijan. 
  In reply to a reporter's question on the cessation of 
Serbian 
attacks against Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin remarked 
that UN peacekeeping forces entered Gorazde in order to be 
stationed between the city and the Serbian forces, which will 
withdraw from the city. According to the latest reports 
concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin announced, positive 
developments are taking place in Gorazde and therefore the UN 
secretary general's special representative does not favor a NATO 
attack at this stage. He added: Consequently, we are not 
expecting an attack at this moment, but, I would like to repeat 
that the Serbs could always be expected to change their minds 
and act differently. 
  Assessing the recent NATO decision aimed at putting an end 
to 
the Serbian attacks on Gorazde, Cetin declared that this is a 
very important decision which does not contain any loopholes. 
Pointing out that the decision covers all safe havens, Cetin 
noted that according to the decision, the NATO Council will not 
have to adopt another decision in the event of a possible 
Serbian attack against the other four safe areas outside 
Sarajevo and Gorazde. I hope this determination on the part of 
NATO will constitute a new important step taken toward a just 
and realistic peace, the foreign minister stated. 
  In his statement, Cetin stressed that Turkey has always 
supported Azerbaijan. His visit to Azerbaijan aims at 
demonstrating once more Turkey's support, Cetin remarked. He 
will return to Turkey tonight.

<F P=106> [From the "Political Diary" column by Derya Sazak: "Green </F>
Siege"] 
  [Excerpts] The mass "rage" displayed on 10 April by 
radical Islamic groups, which used the Gorazde massacre as an 
excuse to turn the "Bosnian cause" into antisecular 
demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul, is not a routine 
phenomenon. 
  It is true that Europe and the United States have remained 
spectators to the "crimes against humanity" perpetrated for the 
past two years against the Bosnian Muslims in the former 
Yugoslavia. The Western world, which attempted to absolve the 
sins of the "genocide" undertaken by the Nazis during World War 
II through films it has been producing since then, is 
unfortunately displaying the same indifference now with regard 
to Bosnia as well. 
  Expressing other intentions under the guise of showing 
"reaction" on the basis of "humanitarian" reasons, however, is a 
deception that goes beyond defending Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  The anti-imperialist winds created using the excuse of 
Bosnia 
and raids against embassies inevitably bring the Iranian example 
to mind. The excuse for the occupation of the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran in November 1979 was the "commemoration of the students 
who fell during the Shah's rule." The meeting held in front of 
the university turned in one moment into an anti-American 
demonstration, leading to the occupation of the U.S. Embassy, 
which in turn played a pivotal role in the establishment of the 
Khomeyni regime. Intellectuals who witnessed the 4 November 
demonstrations grasped the significance of the demonstrations 
only later, saying that "the appearance of mullahs and their 
supporters in the streets for martyred students, who were mostly 
leftists, was very surprising." Probably, a large majority of 
the people in Turkey, who associated the calls -- issued by 
certain television stations to the effect that "all parties are 
participating; our people are rushing into Taksim Square in 
their masses" -- with the massacre in Bosnia, only realized that 
they were deceived by the radicals when they watched the 
television news in the evening. If this trend continues, it is 
clear that the Prosperity Party will no longer be able to 
control such events. 
  The people of Algeria are now suffering the bitter 
consequences of the politicization process brought about by the 
Islamic movements by using force whenever necessary. Algeria 
has been dragged into a civil war in the hands of fanatics. 
[passage omitted] 
  To be able to uphold the social peace and the democratic 
system in the face of the "green siege" around it, in addition 
to "stability," Turkey should also display an interest in new 
overtures and political formations. State of emergency rules 
and military formulas cannot constitute a solution. 
  Above all, the country's need for a powerful social 
democratic platform should be discussed. It is a fact that 
radical movements that develop within democracies eliminate the 
atmosphere of tolerance when they come to office and put an end 
to the freedom of expression. The fanaticism manifested in the 
big cities using the excuse of Bosnia -- which thankfully did 
not cost the lives of innocent people as in the case of the 
Sivas massacre -- should never be forgotten.

  [Text] Ankara, April 23 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman 
Demirel said on Saturday [23 April] that Turkey is sensitive and 
careful on Cyprus issue, "there could not be anything that is 
against Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' [TRNC] 
constitution" he added. 
  Asked how he evaluated the U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
words saying there will be important developments within two 
days on Cyprus issue, Demirel said he did not know Clinton's 
statement in detail but "I met TRNC's parliament speaker Halit 
Acarkan and learned that they were discussing the issue of 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]." 
  Acarkan earlier said the UN proposed CBM's for Cyprus have 
been twisted to the advantage of the Greek Cypriot side. 
  He said his state was under great pressure to accept the 
modified version of the CBM's. 
  The points included to the original package of July 1, 1993 
are, giving the roads leading to the uninhabited Maras [Varosha] 
section to the UN control; limitations to be imposed on all 
planes registered in Turkey in the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport 
which will be opened to international traffic; customs 
procedures to be conducted by an official to be appointed by the 
United Nations to Lefkose Airport and Maras; and the violation 
of the principle that both sides will enjoy equal advantages. 
  Demirel said everyone should accept the two separate 
communities and that these two are the extensions of two 
different nations, should have everything separated, and it is 
not possible to reach a solution by being forced to live 
together. 
  The president said he will visit Egypt in May and he may 
also 
visit Bosnia-Herzegovina to contribute to the peace efforts 
there. 
  Demirel also said he will meet political party leaders on 
May 
4 and discuss the problems of Turkey.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Prime Minister Tansu </F>
Ciller] 
  [Text] It was reported that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton have definitely not discussed 
the Cyprus issue at a tete-a-tete meeting they had in Washington 
last week. 
  According to a statement issued by the Press Center of the 
President's Office, it was recalled that certain statements 
regarding the Cyprus issue were attributed to Ciller in today's 
issue of a newspaper [not further identified]. The statement 
notes that at the meeting between the delegations held in 
Washington, Clinton stated that there was a deadlock regarding 
the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  Ciller, in turn, said the following at the meeting: The 
original CBM's package was, in principle, approved by the 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and was also endorsed by 
Turkey. The package was subsequently changed. It will be 
appropriate to discuss the issue once more before the end of 
April and achieve a rapprochement between the views of the two 
sides. 
  The statement further notes that the minutes of the meeting 
were dispatched to the Foreign Ministry the day of the meeting.

  [Text] Ankara, April 24 (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin denied on Sunday [24 April] claims of some newspapers that 
he and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller had a disagreement on the 
Cyprus issue. 
  Answering questions of the press in the airport, before 
departing for Azerbaijan, Cetin said that the prime minister had 
called him this morning. `The P.M. called me this morning and 
said that she and U.S. President Bill Clinton had not talked 
about Cyprus during their tete-a-tete meeting in Washington,' he 
said. During their telephone conversation, Premier Ciller also 
wanted the foreign minister to tell her the details of a daily's 
report on Saturday who quoted U.S. President Bill Clinton saying 
that he and Ciller had discussed the Cyprus issue and that 
Ciller promised him to resolve the matter soon. `We have 
already reviewed the issue and found out that Clinton has not 
said these words,' Cetin said. 
  He added that the Cyprus coordinator of the U.S. state 
department, Robert Lamb, had called the Turkish Embassy in 
Washington and briefed the embassy on the talks made between 
Clinton and Greek Premier Papandreou in his presence. `I 
reviewed these minutes and could not find anything which would 
yield such a meaning,' Cetin said. 
  Cetin pointed out that all these rumors were a result of the 
distortions of the Greek press. `I know it from my own 
experience that the Greek press distorts my own statements from 
time to time,' he said. 
  Cetin recalled that Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
President Rauf Denktas and Turkey had initially accepted in 
principle, the confidence-building measures formulated by the UN 
secretary general. `However,' he said, `additions made to the 
package, which can be categorized under four broad groups, are 
all giving certain advantages to the Greek Cypriots and TRNC 
President Denktas, rightfully has said that this was not the 
original package. `Turkey has supported the stand of Denktas.' 
  The second package, proposed by the UN on March 21 as a 
`non-document document' gives the control of roads leading to 
Maras [Varosha] to the UN, gives the control of customs to a UN 
official in Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport and Maras, limits Turkish 
planes using the Lefkose Airport and gives other priorities to 
Greek Cypriots. 
  The original package of July 1993, had foreseen to open the 
Lefkose Airport to international traffic and to place the 
uninhabited Maras section of the TRNC to the UN monitoring.

  [Text] Ankara, April 25 (A.A.) - UN special envoy for 
Cyprus, Joe Clark arrived in Ankara on Sunday [24 April] 
accompanied by his aides Gustave Feissel and John Paul Cavanaugh. 
  Clark said that the confidence-building measures package has 
two points, one being the opening of the uninhabited Maras 
[Varosha] section for Greek settlement under UN supervision, and 
the other being the opening of the Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport 
also under UN direction, and the partial lifting of the embargo 
imposed on the Turkish side. 
  He said that the former will profit the Greek Cypriots while 
the latter will be to the advantage of the Turkish Cypriots. 
  Clark said these are the last days of the process and that 
he 
has met with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in New 
York and is due to meet with Turkish officials in Ankara on 
Monday and Tuesday. 
  He added that he will later meet with leaders of both sides 
and a draft report should at least be prepared before next 
Sunday. 
  Clark said the package will benefit both sides and the 
partial lifting of the embargo will strengthen the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus' economy by 20 percent. 
  During their stay, Clark, Feissel, and Cavanaugh will meet 
with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Ozdem Sanberk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller but it is not 
definitive as yet. 
  The envoys will leave Turkey early on Wednesday morning.

Republic of Northern Cyprus who is on an official visit in 
Ankara, and his accompanying delegation have been continuing 
their contacts. The guest speaker visited the leaders of the 
political parties at the parliament and exchanged views. 
  Acarkan first visited the Republican People's Party leader 
Deniz Baykal. Later, he visited the Nationalist Action Party 
leader Alpaslan Turkes and communicated to him that the Turkish 
Cypriots supported continuing with the negotiations however, he 
added, the confidence-building measures were in favor of the 
Greek Cypriots. Turkes, in turn, said that the Cyprus issue is 
costing the Turkish nation, but notwithstanding the Turkish 
nation, nobody can give concessions on the Cyprus issue. 
  Subsequently, Acarkan and his delegation visited Democratic 
Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit. Ecevit stated that it is 
incomprehensible that those who are not intervening in the 
cruelty in Bosnia-Herzegovina are intervening in the peace in 
Cyprus. 
  Lastly, Acarkan and his delegation visited the Prosperity 
Party leader Necmettin Erbakan. Erbakan stated they do not 
recognize an issue such as Cyprus, that peace was established in 
the island in 1974, and that the issue was resolved then.

Turkey will be strengthened in all areas. 
  Pointing out that the clashes in the Caucasus were

cooperation will spread to other neighbors and enable all 
regional countries to live in peace and tranquillity.

activities of the subcommittees will be among the topics to be 
discussed during the three-day meeting. The committee will also 
work on developing new policies to be implemented in the future. 
The joint security committee was established by a security 
agreement signed in 1992 in Tehran. According to this 
agreement, Iran has been handing over to Turkey members of the 
outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). 
  The security agreement foresees a type of cooperation 
between 
Turkey and Iran that would lead the two sides to hand over 
individuals who are suspected of acting against the other 
country. 
  Within the framework of this agreement, joint security 
committees and subcommittees hold periodic meetings to discuss 
the latest developments in field of security.

  [Text] Ankara, April 22 (A.A.) -- Parliament Speaker 
Husamettin Cindoruk described today the crisis in Turkey, being 
a political one, rather than economic. `To eliminate the great 
diversity in the country's politics, people should be united 
around principles, not persons,' Cindoruk said. `If they call me 
to duty, because of my 40-year experience in politics, then I 
may resign from my position as parliament speaker, to unite 
them.' 
  In an interview to be aired Saturday [23 April] on TRT-2, 
Cindoruk said that today's problems in Turkey were similar to a 
solar eclipse. 
  The Parliament's public relations office said today that 
during the interview, Cindoruk said Turkey's future will 
`certainly be bright.' 
  `I share the opinion of citizens that there is an excess of 
political parties and this prevents democracy from being 
genuine,' he said. `Mergers among right and left wing parties 
would prevent a political extravagance.' 
  There are 25 political parties registered in Turkey. Of 
these, 11 have seats in parliament.

  [Text] Ankara, April 24 (A.A) -- Various democratic mass 
organizations, led by the Turkish Confederation of Trade Unions 
(Turk-Is) held a `meeting to protest high living costs and 
unemployment' here today. 
  During the meeting held in the Tandogan Square, laborers and 
civil servants carried such placards as `we oppose the closure 
of work-places', `we earned difficultly, can not give it away 
easily.' 
  Turk-Is leader Bayram Meral, addressing the crowd, said, `we 
shall exercise our power, including a general strike, if this 
government does not resolve your problems, does not remove the 
legislation of September 12 (military intervention), does not 
avail the right to organize under trade unions to civil 
servants.' 
  `If this government , this parliament removes bans on a 
pluralist system, then the laborers, the public employees will 
form their own party,' he said.

  [Text] In Paris, after telephoning his American 
counterpart, Warren Christopher, French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe spoke at length to the deputies, both to castigate those 
preaching, whether intellectuals or Socialists, and to recall 
that there is no possible military solution for Bosnia. Alain 
Juppe also paid tribute to the role of the United Nations in 
Bosnia: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] It is true that there have been 
mistakes, and the way in which the negotiations over Gorazde 
were carried out throughout last Saturday and Sunday illustrates 
this fact. Nevertheless, I would like to qualify this judgement 
made against the United Nations. Everything is demanded of the 
United Nations, and it is given no means to fulfill the mission 
it is assigned. It is not given money; the organization is 
practically bankrupt: the main contributors don't pay -- though 
I must say straight away that this is not the case with France, 
which is up to date with its contributions -- and then the 
secretary general is not given the necessary troops. In Bosnia 
Mr. Butrus-Ghali said several months ago: I cannot fulfill my 
mission if I am not given 7,000-8,000 more men. France is the 
only country to have responded to this request. No other 
country followed. 
  So it's easy to snipe at the United Nations, because it is a 
somewhat anonymous sort of beast. Yes, but we don't have any 
other weapon at our disposal, neither diplomatic weapons, nor 
weapons on the ground. So we have to support it rather than 
continue to denigrate it, I believe. [end recording]

  [Text] Bayonne, France, April 20 (AFP) -- Spanish fishing 
boats blockaded the French port of Hendaye for the second 
straight day Wednesday [20 April] as tension remained high after 
a battle between 60 Spanish and 12 French vessels over their 
anchovy catch. 
  The French Basque region fishermen's union meanwhile on 
Wednesday protested the "unspeakable acts of violence" in 
Monday's incident during which 60 Spanish boats from 
Fuenterrabia, across the border, attacked the 12 French trawlers 
for exceeding their anchovy quota. 
  The French quota is 2,700 tonnes a year and the Spanish 
27,000 tonnes. 
  The Spanish started fires on three of the French ships, 
hurling petrol bombs and trying to board them after throwing 
grappling irons. Spanish fishermen said nine of their boats 
were damaged. 
  Shipping experts here said Wednesday that according to a 
partial estimate of the damage to the French boats, at least two 
nets costing 70,000 francs (12,000 dollars) each were destroyed. 
  French Fisheries Minister Jean Puech said Tuesday that the 
French fishermen should respect their quotas, but added that 
Spanish fishermen had no right to enforce European Union rules 
in French waters. 
  One French boat, the Laetitia, has been held in Fuenterrabia 
since being seized by the Spaniards on Monday, despite a promise 
that it would be returned. An angry crowd in the Spanish port 
burned its nets and destroyed its navigation equipment.

  [Text] Paris, April 20 (AFP) -- France said Wednesday [20 
April] it welcomed an agreement among South African leaders 
ending fears of a Zulu nationalist boycott of the country's 
first multiracial elections. 
  The agreement was reached Tuesday in Pretoria between South 
African President Frederik de Klerk, African National Congress 
leader Nelson Mandela and the Inkatha Freedom Party's leader, 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said France 
"hails the good will and the spirit of compromise shown by all 
parties to reach this accord." 
  He described the agreement as a major step forward "in 
building a democratic, non-racial South Africa".

<F P=106> [Andrew Marshall report: "Brussels Offers Ukraine Energy if </F>
it Scraps Reactors"] 
  [Text] The European Union [EU] will help Ukraine to 
overcome its energy crisis if it scraps the Chernobyl nuclear 
reactor, officials in Luxembourg said yesterday. The proposal 
is contained in a new strategy for assisting the unstable former 
Soviet republic, that is likely to be agreed by the Commission 
next week. As fears grow about the political instability of the 
Union's eastern neighbours, these states are now being given 
increasing attention. 
  Ukraine has slid up the list of European priorities in the 
last six months as the EU and Washington try to untie policy 
towards Kiev from Russia. Ukraine agreed in January to scrap 
its nuclear weapons in a tripartite deal with Moscow and 
Washington, and since then Kiev has lobbied for greater 
assistance, especially with energy. An EU Partnership and 
Co-operation agreement was initialled last month, expanding 
trade ties. Now the Twelve are trying to give more to Ukraine. 
Help with building new power stations would assist the country 
overcome its energy crisis. 
  But this help would be conditional on it scrapping dangerous 
Soviet-style reactors such as Chernobyl. The EU is also likely 
to propose help with agriculture and foreign investment to prop 
up Ukraine's moribund economy. 
  Sir Leon Brittan, EU Trade Commissioner, told foreign 
ministers meeting in Luxembourg of his plans. The Commission 
document is likely to recommend macro-economic aid if Ukraine 
gets an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. It will 
discuss increased trade access and closer political links. 
Britain has also prepared a list of proposals; these are likely 
to be welded with the Commission's approach. 
  Last night, the EU was said to be closer to a deal with 
Russia that has been blocked by a row over nuclear trade. 
Europe maintains limits on imports of nuclear fuel from Russia, 
largely at the insistence of France. It is hoped this can be 
removed as an obstacle to signing a Partnership and Co-operation 
Agreement. The EU is trying to cement ties with Central and 
Eastern European countries, two of which -- Poland and Hungary 
-- have applied to join.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/36: "Declaration by the </F>
European Union on Rwanda"] 
  [Text] The European Union [EU] notes with dismay that the 
widespread violence and atrocities are continuing and extending 
in Rwanda, where very many lives have been lost since 6 April 
1994. 
  The violence and the resulting chaos prompted the forced 
evacuation of virtually all nationals of the international 
community present in Rwanda. 
  As a result of the solidarity shown by member states, it was 
possible to rescue those nationals in a satisfactory manner. 
  The EU repeats its pressing call for Rwandese lives to be 
protected, and urgently appeals to the opposing forces to bring 
the violence to an end and to resume negotiations on the basis 
of the principles in the Arusha agreement. 
  It wishes to see appropriate humanitarian action organized 
in 
response to the human tragedy unfolding in the region, and 
undertakes to play its part in such action.

<F P=106> [Article signed CET (JWI) (MTH): "EU Promises Any Aid The </F>
Future Government of South Africa Might Require"] 
  [Text] Luxembourg, 19 Apr (BELGA) -- Meeting in Luxembourg 
on Tuesday [19 April], the foreign ministers of the European 
Union [EU] promised the future government of South Africa "any 
aid it might require and wide-ranging political and economic 
collaboration in the long term." 
  The ministers of the Twelve, meeting in Council session, 
adopted a whole series of measures intended to offer support to 
the new government that will emerge from the elections on 26 and 
28 April 1994. The promise of aid to South Africa is a 
Community action falling under the heading of European foreign 
policy. 
  From the outset, however, the EU specified that respect for 
human rights and democracy were an essential element of 
relations between the EU and South Africa. 
  First of all, the Twelve promise to work toward canceling UN 
sanctions against Pretoria, which are still being imposed. 
  The current support program for the peaceful transition to 
democracy in South Africa is continuing provisionally, and the 
Union must continue to earmark the funds required for this 
action, maintained the ministers. They recalled that they 
intend to contribute mainly toward improving the standard of 
living of the poorest sectors of the population. 
  As for long-term relations, the Twelve emphasized that they 
do not consider South Africa as a developing country, but that 
they are inclined to allow it to benefit from the same 
commercial advantages as such countries. They also promised to 
contribute toward the establishment and development of regional 
cooperation between southeast African and Indian Ocean 
countries. The EU is calling for mutual investments, encouraged 
and guaranteed by various agreements. To this end, it will ask 
the EIB (European Investment Bank) to extend its activities to 
South Africa. 
  The Twelve said they were ready to collaborate in a large 
number of areas, such as education and training, industry, 
trade, telecommunications, research, and technology. 
  As soon as the new government takes office, the EU intends 
to 
support the establishment of political dialogue and encourage 
the South African cabinet to work toward social justice and to 
eliminate all forms of racial, political, religious, and 
cultural discrimination. 
  The Twelve also confirmed that they wanted to hold an 
international conference on 6 and 7 September 1994 in Berlin, 
gathering together all the countries of southern Africa.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The German-Dutch Corps will be 
established in The Hague on Friday [22 April] as the first joint 
military unit of the two countries. Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and his Dutch counterpart 
Relus ter Beek will sign the agreement, the FRG Defense Ministry 
announced on Thursday [21 April] in Bonn. The corps will 
probably comprise between 50,000 and 70,000 soldiers. 
  The corps will be commanded by a joint corps staff in 
Muenster. Full combat readiness is to be reached in 1995. The 
first commander will be Dutch Major General Ruurd Reitsma. The 
first such unit to be established was the German-French corps, 
which was later supplemented by Belgian units.

<F P=106> [Article signed MTH/MAR: "Last Blue Helmets Have Left </F>
Kigali"] 
  [Text] Mwanza, 19 Apr (BELGA) -- The last 300 Belgian Blue 
Helmets in Rwanda left Kigali and arrived Tuesday evening [19 
April] in Mwanza, Tanzania, where they boarded Hercules C-130 
transport planes bound for Belgium. 
  The evacuation operation ran without a hitch. All the 
Belgian Blue Helmets are safe and sound. 
  According to initial information, the evacuation operation 
was supposed to be conducted by road, but in the end the Blue 
Helmets opted for an evacuation by air. The possibility of a 
land evacuation was apparently a decoy. 
  So, for the Belgian troops the Rwandan episode came to an 
end 
with the Tuesday evening, when the last C-130 departed for 
Brussels. 
  Meanwhile, violent fighting is continuing in the Rwandan 
capital of Kigali. The Rwandan Armed Forces have launched a 
counterattack, while the Rwandan Patriotic Front is trying to 
encircle them. Furthermore, more massacres are occurring in 
Byumba, in northern Kigali.

<F P=106> [GGD (JPB) report: "Belgian Ships Participating in North </F>
Sea Maneuvers"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 21 Apr (BELGA) -- Three ships belonging to 
the Belgian Navy are among the 40 NATO vessels taking part in 
maneuvers in the North Sea, which started Monday [18 April] and 
will continue until the end of next week, a military source 
revealed on Thursday. 
  On Monday, ships from eight countries (Belgium, Denmark, 
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Great Britain, and the 
United States) launched this antimine exercise, code named Blue 
Harrier 94, which is scheduled to end on 29 April. The exercise 
area stretches along the German and Danish coasts. 
Approximately 20 aircraft are also involved, NATO revealed. 
  Three ships from the Belgian Navy are participating in these 
maneuvers, a spokesman for the naval chief of staff said on 
Thursday. The vessels in question are the tripartite mine 
hunters (CMT) Aster and Lobelia -- the latter belonging to the 
STANAVFORCHAN, the standing (NATO) Naval Force for the Channel, 
and the minehunter/minesweeper Dufour. 
  According to NATO, the objective of the exercise is to train 
ships' crews, harmonize multinational defensive operations, and 
improve antimine procedures and tactics. 
  France, which has not been part of the integrated military 
structure of NATO since 1967, is participating in the maneuvers 
within the framework of normal training relations with its 
allies, the Atlantic Alliance stated in a press release.

  [Text] Hannover -- In the view of Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] politician Egon Bahr, the United Nations is 
currently neither willing nor able to intervene militarily in 
Bosnia. In HANNOVERSCHE NEUE PRESSE (Wednesday [20 April] 
edition), the peace researcher also warned that the helplessness 
of the United Nations in Bosnia might lead to a "relapse into 
the policy of strength." He demanded that the United Nations 
must be strengthened and developed into a global collective 
security system. At the moment, the United Nations is only a 
collection of nations "whose 1945 charter has never been 
implemented, because the East-West conflict interfered." 
  A collective security system would have been capable of 
taking timely precautions against the emerging aggression of the 
Serbs, Bahr says. Now the United Nations and the European Union 
(EU) cannot even ensure a watertight embargo. The peace 
researcher said that it is a step into the right direction that 
the nations are supposed to commit themselves to providing 
contingents of armed forces for blue helmet missions.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner to </F>
unidentified ZDF correspondent "immediately after NATO announced 
its new ultimatum to the Serbs" on 22 April in Brussels -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How great is the risk for UN 
Forces stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Woerner] There is certainly a certain risk considering what 
we have seen from the Serbs so far. On the other hand, we will 
apply much more massive means, and we have left no doubt that we 
would not tolerate retaliatory acts without taking appropriate 
steps ourselves, for example close air support, to which we 
could resort at any time in such a situation. 
  [Correspondent] Why does the threat only include bombings 
within a range of 20 km? 
  [Woerner] There are a number of reasons, primarily military 
ones. But there are also monitoring reasons. We have to be 
sure that we can check on what is going on there. 
  [Correspondent] Is the alliance now not facing the danger of 
an uncontrollable escalation of the conflict? 
  [Woerner] I would not absolutely rule out such danger, even 
though I do not regard it as probable. In Sarajevo we had a 
different experience. Then, you must not forget one thing: 
Look at the pictures that can be seen on your television or any 
other television; the bombing of hospitals, even refugee camps 
have been shelled, and civilians are killed in the most cruel 
way. Should we stand idly by? 
  [Correspondent] NATO has now shown its determination in the 
case of Gorazde. What about the remaining safe areas? 
  [Woerner] We will discuss this later. 
  [Correspondent] Where are the problems? 
  [Woerner] There are many problems because each case is 
different. Each of these so-called safe areas has different 
problems, a different environment, different countryside, 
different weather conditions, different terrain, different troop 
strengths of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] forces, 
etc. There is no patent solution, which is why we have to 
discuss each case individually before adopting a decision. Yet, 
I think that a decision will come. 
  [Correspondent] Still today? 
  [Woerner] It is certainly going to be a long session, and we 
might not arrive at a decision before tomorrow morning.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Alexander Privtera after the NATO Council meeting in Brussels on 
22 April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Privtera] Secretary General Woerner, do you 
believe today's decisions will finally convince the Serbs to 
return to the negotiating table and negotiate seriously? 
  [Woerner] I hope so, but to say I believe so would be an 
exaggeration. Above all, we are raising the stakes of their 
aggression. I hope this will at least mean they will think 
about distancing themselves from their policy of unbridled 
aggression particularly against civilians, hospitals, and 
refugee camps. As I say, I cannot express any more than my hope. 
  [Privtera] In the other protection zones, with the exception 
of Gorazde and Sarajevo, there has been no model along the lines 
of the ultimatum for Sarajevo. [sentence as heard] Why this 
solution? Is it perhaps also a concession to Moscow? 
  [Woerner] I would not call it a concession. It does indeed 
give Moscow the possibility, which it already had at the time of 
the first ultimatum for Sarajevo, to talk to the Serbs in an 
effort to convince them to stop attacking safe zones. It will 
not have gone unnoticed that the Russians were disappointed by 
the Bosnian Serbs and their behavior in Gorazde. I can 
therefore well imagine the Russians making their contribution to 
this. But regardless of that, we were the one to make the 
decision, on the advice of the UN secretary general; but the 
decision, as I said, was made by the 16 NATO nations.

  [Text] [Correspondent Privetera] I do not believe that the 
danger will be great above all for the NATO pilots, but rather 
for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops on site in Bosnia. 
Asked what the situation would be if, for instance, UNPROFOR 
troops were attacked, Manfred Woerner told me the following 
this morning: 
  [Begin Woerner recording] Well, it is clear that additional 
risks may be associated with this. However, the contrary could 
happen, too. The evidence of a strong determination and the use 
of more substantial military means could persuade the Bosnian 
Serbs to give up their policy of taking hostages. However, as I 
have said, I do not wish to speculate on this. 
  What we can do is use our air force for their protection. 
This will happen, too. And then, do not forget, we cannot 
decide on such action by ourselves. We must do this in 
cooperation with the commanders of the UNPROFOR troops, the 
United Nations troops, who are the only ones who are down there 
on the ground. And they will certainly be interested in 
protecting their people. Therefore, only such strikes will be 
carried out in which the risk is limited, at least that is my 
assumption. 
  You know there is something I do not understand. On the one 
hand, we are being accused of doing nothing, or not enough. 
When we do something they say: Do you not fear an escalation? 
  First of all I do not believe that the measures as such will 
trigger an escalation of this kind. What they will achieve is 
that the price of the aggression, the price for attacking safe 
areas will become higher, considerably higher. And I can 
certainly imagine that the military leaders will ask themselves, 
at the latest after the first two, three missions, whether this 
is worth the risk. This is our chance. [end recording]

fears that Major Van Baal, who has been missing since last 
Monday [18 April], is being held hostage by the Bosnian Serbs 
and will not be handed over to UN Headquarters for the time 
being. The Bosnian Serbs are said to have laid down conditions 
for the release of this Netherlander UN observer. 
  The Defense Ministry inferred this from a telephone 
conversation with General Bastiaans, head of the UN Military

not known. The Defense Ministry assumes that Van Baal will 
serve as "bargaining chip" for better relations with the UN

<F P=106> [IAEA "Press Release -- for use of information media, not an </F>
official record": "International Experts Review the Safety 
Situation at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station"] 
  [Text] Experts from a dozen countries reviewed with 
Ukrainian representatives the current safety situation at the 
Chernobyl Nuclear Power station at the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) Headquarters in Vienna 21-22 April 1994. 
  A recent IAEA expert mission in March 1994 found serious 
safety deficiencies at the Chernobyl station and on that basis 
its Director General informed the President of Ukraine that 
international levels of safety were not being met. It was 
subsequently agreed that a meeting of interested parties be 
convened in April to consider what actions could be taken to 
alleviate the situation. 
  The Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, in opening the meeting 
reminded the participants that national governments carry the 
responsibility for safety in nuclear installations in their 
territory. Yet there is legitimate international concern about 
maintaining safety of nuclear installations any where. 
Technical safety issues and actions would need to be considered 
in the context of other factors that influence the current 
situation such as the overall energy and economic circumstances 
in the Ukraine. 
  The Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister, Mr Valeriy Shmarov, and 
the Chairman of the State Committee on the Utilization of 
Nuclear Power, Mr. Umanetz, discussed the energy and economic 
situations and the current safety situation at Chernobyl. The 
meeting also heard views of the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (EBRD) on the energy and economic situations and 
was given a summary of the IAEA safety mission results. 
  Ukrainian officials pointed out that energy use had dropped 
lately due to the temporary economic depression, but should rise 
substantially as the economy improves; per capita energy 
consumption is inordinately high, but reducing it would require 
complete overhaul of the infrastructure, lasting decades; the 
country is already heavily dependent on external, expensive and 
potentially unreliable sources for gas and oil; coal is becoming 
harder to extract and, in any event, greater use depends on 
introducing, at high cost, modern combustion technology; and 
thus, Ukraine must look to nuclear energy as a continuing major 
source to meet its energy requirements. 
  They further stated that the role of nuclear power is 
essential in their energy planning. More modern VVER 
[water-moderated water-cooled power reactor] reactors will be 
required along with on-time completion of five additional VVER 
plants now under construction. The output of the Chernobyl 
station is currently a least cost alternative for energy supply. 
Completion of three VVER 1000MW units in an advanced stage of 
construction can be completed by 1996 at a cost of $196 million. 
Two additional units can be completed by 1999 bringing the 
total cost to $1.2 billion. 
  They believe that the Chernobyl station could be upgraded to 
a level no less safe than other currently operating RBMK 
[expansion unknown] reactors. Chernobyl is now behind in 
implementing the safety improvements at other RMBKs, but the 
pace of implementation could be accelerated, if sufficient 
resources were available. To date no international financial 
assistance directed at improving the safety situation at 
Chernobyl has been provided by the international community. 
  There was consensus at the meeting that the many factors 
involved make the situation at Chernobyl complex and that there 
was no simple one-step solution. Some participants suggested 
continued technical assessment which could be undertaken in the 
frame-work of IAEA activities. A clear majority wished to see 
operation at Chernobyl discontinued as soon as conditions allow. 
  In concluding the IAEA's Assistant Director General for 
Nuclear Safety, Morris Rosen, reminded the participants that, in 
addition to the recent loss of many highly qualified staff, and 
no matter what improvements were made, the situation at 
Chernobyl was unique: For several years Chernobyl would be at a 
lower level of safety than similar plants; the severe economic 
situation would impact on the availability of spare parts and 
the procurement of modern equipment. In addition one of the 
former units is encased in a currently deteriorating shelter and 
the remaining units would be operating in an environment of 
elevated radiation levels.

  [Text] Geneva, April 22 (AFP) -- The United Nations is 
proposing a renamed, federal Georgia to resolve a conflict 
between Tbilisi and the separatist region of Abkhazia, Swiss 
mediator Edouard Brunner told journalists Friday [22 April]. 
  Talks on a political solution to the conflict, held in 
Geneva 
since Tuesday with Russian participation, will continue May 10 
in Moscow. 
  The idea is to create a decentralised new state within the 
same frontiers, said Brunner, special representative of UN 
secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The United Nations is insisting on the principle of 
territorial integrity in the proposal, which has been presented 
to both delegations, and "the two sides have come closer on a 
certain number of points and ideas," he commented. 
  Brunner could not say whether the Abkhazians, who have 
fought 
for independence throughout 1993, would accept such a compromise. 
  "We are talking on the basis that they accept to discuss a 
state which is not an independant Abkhazian state, but I cannot 
read their hearts," he said. 
  A ceasefire agreement signed in Moscow April 4 includes 
talks 
on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia and the 
deployment of UN peacekeepers as well as the political 
settlement. 
  Brunner said he was waiting for a response from the two 
sides 
this weekend to a framework proposal for a UN force including up 
to 30 percent Russian troops and contingents from other former 
Soviet republics. 
  Last week UN and Russian negotiators came up with proposals 
for a buffer force of 2,500 international observers between the 
two sides along the Inguri River.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Pangalos </F>
Underlines the Importance of a Convergence of Efforts in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] After the latest bloody events and the ongoing 
attacks on Gorazde by the Bosnian Serbs, the European Union 
should carefully reconsider what it can do in the future to 
contribute, in spite of all, to providing a solution to the 
Bosnian conflict. Meanwhile, absolute priority must be given to 
"saving what it is possible to save." Thus, Council President 
Mr. Pangalos summarized at Wednesday [20 April] morning's debate 
in the European Parliament the latest tragic developments in 
Bosnia. 
  Mr. Pangalos affirmed once again that the solution to the 
conflict could only be political and that reaching such a 
solution requires a convergence of all initiatives (European 
Union, UN, Russia, United States). The warring parties are 
trying to take advantage of the divergences in the international 
community to pursue their objectives. According to Mr. 
Pangalos, the only realistic solution would be a partitioning of 
Bosnia, with 59 percent for the Muslims and Croats and 41 
percent for the Serbs. While all were very critical of the 
international community and the European Union in particular, 
MEP's were divided on how to solve the conflict. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr. Pangalos said Mr. Yeltsin's recent declarations asking 
the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde were of capital 
importance and opened new political prospects. To those 
comparing this war to the Gulf conflict, Mr. Pangalos replied 
that, for geographical and military reasons, the same type of 
interventions could not be envisaged in ex-Yugoslavia. He also 
noted that no one would voluntarily send "thousands and 
thousands" of troops to Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Middle East -- </F>
Details on Joint Action Decided by Council of Union in Support 
of Peace Process"] 
  [Text] As briefly announced in yesterday's EUROPE, the 
General Affairs Council adopted a joint action in support of the 
Middle East peace process, after recalling that: 
  (i) the EU has supported the breakthrough in negotiations 
between Israel and the PLO through the immediate provision of 
increased assistance and has announced its intention to provide 
ECU500 million in aid for the development of the Occupied 
Territories in the years 1994-1998; 
  (ii) the European Union supports the development of the 
countries of the region under the Redirected Mediterranean 
Policy (ECU4.5 billion for 1992 to 1996); 
  (iii) some Member States have already been asked to 
participate in the temporary international presence in Hebron. 
  The following are the main points of the joint action agreed 
on Tuesday [19 April]. In order to work for the conclusion of a 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East, the EU will: 
  (a) participate in international arrangements agreed by the 
parties to guarantee peace and contribute to defining the future 
shape of relations between the regional parties in the context 
of the Arms Control and Regional Security Working Group; 
  (b) develop its role in the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee 
responsible for the coordination of international aid to the 
Occupied Territories, maintain its leading role in the Regional 
Economic Development Working Group and develop its participation 
in other multilateral groups, consider additional ways in which 
it might contribute to the development of the region; 
  (c) pursue confidence building measures which it has 
submitted to the parties, pursue demarches to the Arab states 
with the aim of securing an end to the boycott of Israel and 
closely follow the future of Israeli settlements throughout the 
Occupied Territories and pursue demarches to Israel about this 
issue. Further, the Council will examine proposals the 
Commission will make: 
  (i) for the rapid implementation of programmes of assistance 
for the development of the Occupied Territories and a 
Palestinian operating budget; 
  (ii) to provide aid in the framework of existing guidelines 
to the other parties to the bilateral negotiations as they 
progress substantially towards peace. In order to contribute 
actively and urgently to the creation of a Palestinian Police 
Force, the EU will provide assistance: Funds for ECU10 million 
will be made available from the Community budget as a matter of 
urgency. At the request of the parties, the European Union will 
participate in the protection of the Palestinian people through 
a temporary international presence in the Occupied Territories 
(Security Council Resolution 904). 
  Operational arrangements and financing arising from this 
decision will be the subject of a separate and specific Council 
decision. Also at the request of the parties, the EU will 
implement a coordinated programme of assistance in preparing for 
and observing the elections in the Occupied Territories. 
Arrangements will be the subject of a separate Council decision 
once Israel and the PLO have reached agreement on arrangements 
for the elections. The EP [European Parliament] will be invited 
to participate in those arrangements. Lastly, the European 
Union confirms its willingness to take further operational 
decisions in the field of this joint action, in accordance with 
developments in the peace process.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/327: "Republic of Korea -- </F>
Partial Suspension From the GSP"] 
  [Text] The Commission yesterday adopted a proposal for a 
Council regulation to partially suspend the GSP [General Scheme 
of Preferences] benefit for the Republic of Korea. This 
suspension will be applicable to textile products covered by the 
multifibre arrangement, with effect from 1 July 1994. 
  This action is the result of the decision of the Republic of 
Korea to unilaterally increase its customs import duties for 
some products for which the European Union is a major supplier 
to the Korean market. This action, has had a direct and 
detrimental effect on exports from the Union. 
  The measures taken by the Republic of Korea, given the 
actual 
timing of their implementation, are contrary to the spirit of 
the Uruguay Round GATT agreement, which calls for freer, more 
liberalised Union, in particular, when it is taken by a country 
whose per capita gross domestic product is similar to that 
enjoyed by some regions of the European Union.

"EU/Ukraine: Commission Suggests Agricultural and Nuclear Aid"] 
  [Text] Having got a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement 
with Ukraine under its belt, the European Commission has now 
turned to the more urgent task of how to help the former Soviet 
republic's farm production and civil nuclear energy systems out 
of crisis. EU [European Union] External Economic Relations 
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan went to the Foreign Affairs 
Council in Luxembourg on April 18 armed with a "first thoughts" 
paper on Ukraine, containing three major proposals. The 
Commission will consider the full paper at its April 27 meeting, 
then pass it back to the Foreign Affairs Council in May. 
<H5>  Options </H5>
  "The paper proposes alternatives. These must go to Council 
and one cannot be sure they will materialise," an EU source 
said. Sir Leon told ministers about U.S. studies calculating a 
shortfall in agricultural inputs in Ukraine worth about 120 
million U.S. Dollars, and suggested this problem could be 
addressed by provision of seeds and fertilizers to Ukraine 
either directly or via a loan for purchase of materials. 
  A second option would be a straight balance of payments loan 
to Ukraine, although this would have to be part of an 
International Monetary Fund package. The Commission has not put 
any figures to these suggestions yet, and officials said 
budgetary implications of the ideas would be considered as they 
became more concrete. 
  Option three would be an aid scheme for building nuclear 
reactors with modern technology and improving their safety 
record. However, this type of assistance would only be granted 
on the condition that the Ukrainian authorities bite the bullet 
and close down the ill-fated Chernobyl plant, where the world's 
worst nuclear accident on April 26, 1986 polluted the 
surrounding countryside and large areas of Europe, causing many 
deaths and leading to a high incidence of cancer in the Ukraine. 
The advantage of this proposal would be that it would finally 
close Chernobyl and show EU citizens that their governments were 
doing something for their safety, an official said. He admitted 
this would cost "very big money," and would have to be 
coordinated with the other major donors as the Group of Seven.

"EU/Russia: Moscow Offers Compromise on Trade in Nuclear Fuel"] 
  [Text] In a surprise move, the Russian Government on 18 
April put some urgency behind the 17-month-old talks with the EU 
over a Partnership Cooperation Agreement. Moscow urged 
compromise in the crucial area of trade in nuclear materials and 
announced it would send one of the Government's heaviest-hitters 
to Brussels on 27 April with the aim of bringing the talks to an 
end. 
  Alexandr Shokin, the minister responsible for the economy 
and 
foreign trade, wrote to the EU foreign affairs ministers, 
meeting in Council in Luxembourg on 18 April, calling for their 
"cooperation" in bringing the talks to "an early and successful 
conclusion." Although there are officially three issues standing 
in the way of the Treaty -- nuclear materials, rights for EU 
ships flying non-EU flags, and the establishment of foreign 
banks in Russia -- the stakes have now in reality boiled down to 
the issue of cheap uranium imports into the Union. In his 
letter, Mr. Shokin referred to the nuclear fuel trade problem as 
the "principal outstanding obstacle" in the way of an Agreement 
that would regularise EU-Russian political and economic 
relations and get Russia on the same footing as Ukraine, which 
penned a similar Partnership Agreement with the EU in March. 
  Russia wants trade in nuclear materials to be incorporated 
into the Agreement along with other related issues such as 
investment, nuclear nonproliferation, conversion of defence 
industries, nuclear safeguards and environmental policy. The 
EU's official stance has been until now that a separate 
Agreement is needed to regulate Russian uranium exports to the 
EU while France has taken a harder line in seeking a quota. The 
Eurodif plant in Tricastin, France, produces 40 percent of 
world's requirements of enriched uranium, and the Paris 
Government is concerned this industry would be threatened by 
Russia's enormous capacity to make the same product at much 
lower prices. 
  Mr. Shokin acknowledged this fear in his letter, and said 
Russia is "prepared to provide assurances that its exports of 
natural and enriched uranium to the Community will be 
nondisruptive, avoiding sudden surges." However, in return, 
Russia would want assurances that the EU would avoid unilateral 
measures "disrupting mutual trade" and would consult with 
Russian Government if problems arose over time. Mr. Shokin 
enclosed a draft exchange of letters between Russia and the EU, 
including all his proposals. 
  In a statement at the end of the Council meeting, the 
foreign 
ministers said the Russian proposals "merit careful study," and 
called on the Commission to look into them with the intention of 
seeking a joint response from the Council. Ministers confirmed 
the "great importance" they attached to completing the 
Partnership Agreement negotiations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Only Way Out"] </F>
  [Text] There is a military maxim, much quoted in 
discussions of the Balkans today: "Never reinforce failure." 
The greatest failure of Western policy in Bosnia, however, has 
not been a military one. It has been an elementary failure of 
understanding about the very nature of the war itself. So 
terrible has the slaughter been -- 200,000 people killed, two 
million driven from their homes, and the hospital wards of 
Gorazde reduced to a mess of rubble and blood -- that the 
outside world has simply recoiled in horror, convinced that no 
rational understanding of such actions can be possible. 
  Starting from the assumption that they could take no view on 
the political rights and wrongs of the war, the Western 
governments insisted that they would deal only with its 
"humanitarian" aspects. Then a UN military involvement was 
tacked on to the humanitarian aid effort and then the policy of 
"safe areas" was added on to that, leading eventually to a 
direct military confrontation with the Serbs. Now Nato has 
dramatically increased its commitment to defend the safe area of 
Gorazde, raising the military stakes still higher. 
  But while the nature of our involvement has gradually 
changed, there has been no change in our fundamental 
misunderstanding of the war. The basic idea remains that we 
must treat all parties as equal, with equally valid claims, and 
bring about "a negotiated settlement" (i.e., a carve-up of 
Bosnia) in which as many as possible of those conflicting claims 
are satisfied. 
  Several failures of understanding are involved here. They 
include these three repeated by British ministers throughout the 
war: that the Bosnian government is "a warring faction"; that 
the Serb forces are fighting against "the Muslims"; and that the 
war is just "a civil war." 
  The Bosnian government is not a faction; it is the elected 
government of a sovereign state. The independence and 
sovereignty of Bosnia (which Britain has recognised) were voted 
for by an absolute majority of Bosnian citizens. The government 
contains Serbs and Croats, neither it nor its army can be 
described simply as "the Muslims." And the war itself is not 
just a civil war, but a war of territorial conquest planned, 
directed and supplied by Serbia, a neighbouring state. 
  Anyone who understands these matters can see which side of 
the conflict deserves our political support. It is not 
necessary to become steeped in Balkan politics, or to fall prey 
to emotional moralism. It is sufficient to bear in mind the 
basic political principles which we ourselves value: legality, 
sovereignty and democracy. We would take offence if American 
politicians started calling the British Army in Northern Ireland 
a "warring faction"; Bosnians feel similarly offended when our 
politicians dismiss their own legal government with that phrase. 
  The Bosnian government has a just cause; but is it, 
nevertheless, a hopeless one? Here again the facts are shrouded 
in a fog of misunderstanding. It is simply assumed that the 
defeat of the Bosnian army is inevitable, and that the Serb 
forces will always fictate "the facts on the ground." 
  The history of the war suggests otherwise. From the moment 
the Bosnian government began properly to organise its forces, 
the Serb advance was largely checked, and in some areas pushed 
back. Only the UN-imposed arms embargo prevented the Bosnian 
army from regaining more territory. Though they still enjoy a 
huge superiority in weapons, the Serb forces suffer now from 
dwindling numbers and poor morale; recruitment to the Bosnian 
army continues to rise, and it now outnumbers the Serbs by more 
than two to one. There is nothing invincible about the Serb army 
in Bosnia. 
  The defeat of this Serb force is both possible and 
politically desirable. Yet it does not automatically follow 
that we should wage war against it ourselves. No British 
government can be expected to risk the lives of thousands of 
British troops in a foreign war unless it believes that vital 
British interests are at stake. Neither the government nor the 
public believe that about Bosnia, and although we would not be 
unaffected by the long-term consequences of a Serb victory 
(further instability in the Balkans, and precedents for 
aggression elsewhere), it cannot be argued that our national 
interests are immediately involved. 
  All the more reason, then, why we should rethink our policy 
now. Instead of becoming more and more involved in a war we do 
not want to fight, we should step back and stop obstructing the 
one body which has both the will and the right to fight it: the 
army of the legitimate Bosnian government. The arms embargo can 
and should be lifted. Since its legal status is doubtful (it 
conflicts with the basic right of self-defence, and it was 
imposed on a state, Yugoslavia, which no longer exists), we need 
only announce that we will not regard it as applying to Bosnia 
until a new Security Council resolution specifically says that 
it does. The deliveries could begin tomorrow. 
  At the same time, we should remove all our own ground troops 
from Bosnia. They are not sufficient to fight a war, and can 
only become hostages or targets for reprisals. This does not 
mean, however, that all aid deliveries would have to cease. 
Deliveries of every kind could continue through the Croat and 
Bosnian-held territories, but their security would be the 
responsibility of the Bosnian government's own forces. 
  Whether we then give the Bosnians support from the air would 
be a matter for further judgment, both military and political. 
So long as we could do this at low risk to our pilots, a case 
could be made for such a limited intervention, not least to 
redress the imbalance which our own previous intervention (the 
arms embargo) had created. 
  We might still end up dropping bombs on Serb tanks. But we 
would be doing so not to reinforce a failed policy -- 
establishing "safe areas" in a sea of "warring factions" -- but 
to enable a legitimate government to win a war. The British 
people might then understand what we were doing, and why.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Road From Maarakesh"] </F>
  [Text] With the signature of the Uruguay Round accord in 
Marrakesh this month, world trade policy has, crossed a 
threshold -- possibly a watershed. The deal breaks new ground 
by extending GATT disciplines to important areas, including 
services, agriculture and textiles; by reinforcing the GATT 
system through the planned World Trade Organisation; and by 
enshrining a far stronger commitment to multilateral rules by 
developing countries, notably in Asia and Latin America. 
  The task now is to entrench and build on these achievements. 
The immediate priority is speedy legislative ratification of 
the round, so that it and the WTO [World Trade Organization] 
begin operating at the start of next year. Delays -- 
particularly in the U.S., the European Union or Japan could 
slow, or even reverse, the momentum of liberalisation. Only 
when that risk is removed can policymakers tackle in earnest the 
bigger challenges ahead. 
  The first such challenge is to continue eliminating 
obstacles 
to trade. Though the round covers in principle most categories 
of trade, concrete arrangements for opening many services 
markets remain to be negotiated. In sectors such as agriculture 
and textiles, governments have to show that the will implement 
agreed liberalisation timetables. Given political 
sensitivities, that is far from a foregone conclusion. 
  Furthermore, liberalisation is all unending process. In 
future, it will increasingly be focused on obstacles created by 
countries' domestic policies. That thrust reflects in part the 
GATT's past successes in lowering barriers to visible trade at 
frontiers. It is also dictated by the expansion of 
international trade in services and the growing importance of 
cross-border capital flows as an engine of economic integration. 
However, devising multilateral rules which promote free 
competition, while respecting genuine national diversity, will 
require much skill. 
<H5>  Orderly Mechanisms </H5>
  It will also test the WTO's ambitions to supersede trade 
rounds by acting as a permanent negotiating forum. That would 
reduce the protracted negotiations, brinkmanship and risk of 
irretrievable breakdown which have bedevilled past rounds. But 
it is still unclear whether the WTO's more orderly mechanisms 
will produce the decisive agreements which have so far required 
the complex international trade-offs and political dynamics 
generated by a full-scale round. 
  Consensus will not be made easier by pressures to load the 
WTO's agenda with contentious new issues, such as environment 
policy and workers' rights. The industrialised powers' demands 
for action on these questions have already created severe 
frictions with developing countries, which fear they are simply 
a pretext for trade protection. 
<H5>  Rigorous Analysis </H5>
  The links between trade and areas such as environment are 
still poorly understood. What constructive policy measures are 
necessary or possible is even less certain. Much rigorous 
analysis and debate is needed to define the issues more clearly 
and to prevent the agenda from being hijacked by powerful 
lobbies with a tenuous commitment to free trade. 
  The biggest challenge of all is to guard against a relapse 
into bilateral policies and protectionism particularly before 
the WTO is in place. Bilateralism can most effectively be 
checked by an international effort to help the U.S. out of the 
hole it has dug in its dealings with Japan. Tokyo needs to play 
its part by pressing ahead with domestic liberalisation. But 
the U.S. must also want to be helped. 
  Washington has often argued that its bilateral trade 
initiatives were necessitated by the deficiencies of the GATT 
disputes procedures. These will be much strengthened once the 
WTO is operating. However, Washington's recent row with Ottawa 
over grain imports -- in which the former has baulked at the 
findings of a disputes panel it helped set up -- suggests a 
disturbing reluctance to accept independent rulings which 
disagree with U.S. interests. 
  International economic recovery should make an outbreak of 
protection less likely. However, that risk remains while 
unemployment stays high, notably in Europe. It makes still more 
essential the pursuit of sound macro-economic policies and 
vigorous structural reforms. In the last analysis, effective 
domestic policies are the best guarantee of free world trade.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the view of FRG Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt, the GATT trade agreement, which was concluded 
in Marrakesh, is of outstanding importance for Germany as an 
export nation. This is a "milestone in trade policy," Rexrodt 
said in a government statement delivered in the Bundestag on 
Friday [22 April]. 
  Thus, the average customs rate for trade with industrial 
goods will decline from 6.3 to 3.9 percent. Particularly 
successful is the agreement about the liberalization of 
services. Here Germany, as the largest exporter of services, 
benefits most since services alone amount to one-quarter of 
Germany's overall exports. In this field are working one-third 
of the 7 million people employed in exports. 
  Rexrodt affirmed his intention to bring the GATT follow-up 
institute, the World Trade Organization, WTO, to Bonn. However, 
Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland are also interested in being the 
headquarters of the new international organization. According 
to the economics minister, tasks still remaining for 
liberalization are the opening up of financial services and 
ocean traffic, and a multilateral steel agreement. 
  On behalf of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Uwe 
Jens 
stated that the agreement comes more than one year too late. 
What is urgently needed is, above all, an active labor market 
policy in Germany in order to push ahead with reducing 
unemployment and promoting employment.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- After a profound recession in 
1993 and a weak beginning of the year in 1994, the "sky of the 
economic development" is now getting lighter, according to FRG 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany). Even though the labor market remains "a big problem" 
with an average of 3.9 million unemployed this year, economic 
growth of 1.5 percent or even more in real terms all over 
Germany can now be assumed, Rexrodt told journalists on Friday 
[22 April]. Before the presentation of the spring report by the 
six leading economic research institutes, which is expected to 
take place next Tuesday, he said that this means a growth of at 
least 1 percent for the old laender and of 8 percent of the new 
laender. As a result, in the west an inflation rate with a "two 
in front of the decimal point" is within reach. There he expects 
an average of 3 percent, in the east 3.5 percent. 
  Rexrodt sees his assessment of the end of January confirmed 
-- in particular since industry and the associations expressed 
far more optimistic at the Hannover Fair than a few weeks ago 
during the wage negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  Of the 3.9 million unemployed, 2.67 million will be in the 
west and 1.2 million in the east. The companies' regained 
competitiveness "does not have any effect for the reduction of 
basic unemployment," Rexrodt admitted. However, together with 
the Bonn action program, the current signals of the economic 
development -- orders received, business expectations, as well 
as capacity utilization of industry (79 percent in view of a 
longstanding average of 85 percent), a strong construction 
sector, as well as first improvements in the steel and chemical 
industry -- provide prospects for employment in 1995. In the 
new laender, too, the economic development is considerably 
improving, not only in the construction sector but also 
regarding other investments. 
  The Federal Government was harshly criticized by Social 
Democratic Party economic spokesman Oskar Lafontaine. Since the 
economic development is mainly based on exports, this shows that 
the Federal Government "is unable to bring about a real upswing 
for everyone." In order to avoid further weaknesses in 
consumption, he once again called for a supplementary tax on 
incomes of more than 60,000 German marks [DM] per year for 
singles and DM120,000 marks for couples. In his view, the 
purchasing power of the masses is not weakened -- in contrast to 
the effect of the solidarity surcharge -- because more than 80 
percent of all taxpayers will be exempt.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to FRG Environment Minister 
Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union), a concrete date for 
the closure of the fatal reactor of Chernobyl, which has been 
demanded for years, cannot be given at present. "Unfortunately, 
I have to say that the chance of its closure cannot be called 
very concrete," he admitted in a DPA interview on Sunday [24 
April]. Toepfer made these comments with a view to the upcoming 
eighth anniversary of the reactor catastrophe of Chernobyl on 26 
April 1986. 
  The original decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to close 
the entire plant by 1993 has meanwhile been revised, despite 
protests "from Germany and other Western states," Toepfer 
explained. He pointed out that Ukraine has again and again 
presented the question of power supply as "the bottleneck that 
prevents the two reactors in Chernobyl that are still operating 
from being switched off." Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister 
Valeriy Shmarov also made this clear at the latest Chernobyl 
conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 
Vienna. Nevertheless, the majority of representatives called 
for its closure. 
  Toepfer pointed out that the problem of power supply also 
applies to the other 12 nuclear reactors of Soviet design in 
Central and Eastern Europe, which are still unsafe and continue 
to produce electricity. He said it is now of prime importance 
in the case of Chernobyl to renew the protective concrete cover 
-- the so-called sarcophagus of the exploded reactor block, 
across which cracks are meanwhile running -- in order to keep 
the still highly active radiation contained within. According 
to Toepfer, a relevant competition of ideas for its renewal has 
been concluded. A French and a German proposal had been rated 
best. The participating enterprises had formed a consortium. 
  He said that the presumable costs will amount to billions 
[currency not specified]. According to him, it is still open 
how they are to be raised. Therefore, "the international 
banking system headed by the World Bank will have to be 
approached once again," Toepfer stressed. The approximately 1.2 
billion German marks [DM], which have been designated so far by 
24 industrial and threshold countries, including the European 
Union and the FRG, are largely destined for other securing 
measures and the qualification of the operating staff in the 
eastern reactors. Bonn alone will provide more than DM250 
million by 1995.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Friday [22 April] the Bundestag 
finally approved the compromise on the nursing-care insurance 
with the overwhelming majority of the votes from the coalition 
and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] opposition. 
Subject to the approval of the Bundesrat next Friday, which is 
considered certain, the law can come into force on 1 January 
1995. 
  FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian Democratic 
Union) 
said that the implementation of the law will depend on the good 
will and dedication of many people. A law cannot replace human 
readiness for help. 
  Rudolf Dressler, the SPD's chief negotiator, pointed out 
that 
his party has achieved considerable improvements during the 
months of the mediation procedure between the Bundestag and the 
Bundesrat. Now it is the business of the laender to keep the 
promise of abolishing one public holiday to compensate for the 
costs arising for the employers. Gisela Babel (Free Democratic 
Party of Germany) said that it is to her party's credit that the 
nursing-care insurance did "not" turn out to "be larger, 
clumsier, and more expensive." 
  The Party of Democratic Socialism and the Alliance 
90/Greens, 
who had come out in favor of a nursing-care insurance finance 
via taxes, expressed their disappointment.

  [Text] Bonn/Siegen (DPA) -- The defense experts of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Bundestag group and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) have 
largely settled their controversy over the future size and 
structure of the Bundeswehr. After a three-hour talk behind 
closed doors in Siegen CDU/CSU Defense Policy spokesman Paul 
Breuer told DPA on Sunday [24 April] evening that the reduction 
to 340,000 men, which Ruehe has proposed, has been basically 
approved. The precondition is, however, that the necessary 
structures are preserved so that in case of emergency the 
maximum number of 370,000 can be reached quickly again. 
  In the "crisis reaction forces," which are primarily 
intended 
for international missions, conscripts are to be given the 
opportunity to volunteer, Breuer said. Service is to last 12 
months in this case. In the " 
Main Defense Forces, on the other hand, which are to be 
responsible for national defense, 10 months of service are to be 
sufficient if service is "shaped compactly." 
  Breuer spoke of a "businesslike climate" of the talks with 
Ruehe, which have led to a real compromise. The results must 
now be discussed in the Bundestag groups. This Tuesday the 
coalition representatives and the Cabinet intend to discuss 
Ruehe's plans.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The situation has improved for the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. 
It is benefiting from increasingly positive expectations for 
economic development, in particular among voters in western 
Germany, as the latest poll of the ZDF [Second German Television 
Channel] Political Barometer shows. In April the CDU/CSU 
reached its highest popularity in a year (west: 39 percent, 
east: 24 percent), ZDF reported on Friday [22 April]. 
  However, a majority of 54 percent still believe that the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will win the Bundestag 
elections in October; 30 percent believe that the government of 
the CDU/CSU and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] will win. 
In the March poll, however, 61 percent had predicted an SPD 
election victory, and only 23 percent saw the government in the 
lead. 
  In contrast to the CDU/CSU coalition partners, the FDP was 
not able to achieve an increase in popularity. In the so-called 
Political Barometers projection, which also includes the 
longer-term behavior of the voters, the FDP was at the critical 
5 percent threshold in April. If Bundestag elections were held 
next Sunday, the CDU/CSU would get 37 percent (plus 1 percentage 
point,) the FDP 5 percent (minus 1 percentage point). The 
results for the other parties would remain unchanged: SPD--39 
percent; Greens--9 percent; Republikaner--4 percent; and Party 
of Democratic Socialism--3 percent. 
  The proportion of German citizens who expect an economic 
upswing has almost doubled over the past half year, according to 
the Political Barometer. In October there were 23 percent, in 
April 43 percent (west: 46 percent, east: 34 percent). Parallel 
to this development, for the first time since last autumn the 
CDU regained its competence for economic policy in the west 
Germans' view and was once again ahead of the SPD (CDU/CSU: 27 
percent, SPD: 22 percent). In eastern Germany the CDU/CSU and 
the SPD are attributed an approximately equal share in their 
ability to solve economic problems (CDU/CSU: 19 percent, SPD: 21 
percent). 
  For the Political Barometer in April the Mannheim Election 
Research group polled about 1,000 representatively chosen voters 
in western and eastern Germany respectively.

  [Text] Munich/Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Approximately 3,000 
people demonstrated peacefully against the deportation of Kurds 
and German arms deliveries to Turkey in Munich and Duesseldorf 
on Saturday [23 April]. 
  Approximately 2,000 participants in Munich followed the call 
of the Alliance Against Racism and other organizations. 
Reportedly, two persons were temporarily detained because they 
were armed. Several police squadrons had been employed. 
  Kurdish women and children gathered with flags and posters 
in 
the center of Duesseldorf. On Friday evening, the 
demonstration, which had been registered as a "children's party" 
and had first been prohibited by the Duesseldorf police 
president, was authorized by the local administrative court. As 
a precaution, the police had concentrated several police 
squadrons in the North Rhine-Westphalian capital in order to be 
armed against possible riots. 
<H5>  Stoiber: Kurds Forfeit Right of Hospitality With Criminal </H5>
Offenses 
  In the controversy over the deportation of Kurds, Bavarian 
Minister President Edmund Stoiber has meanwhile affirmed the 
tough line of the Christian Social Union Land Government. 
"Someone who smashes the kneecap of a police officer or 
overturns cars and sets them on fire forfeits the right of 
hospitality and has to be sent home," Stoiber said before the 
Christian-Social Employees (CSA) in Munich on Saturday.

  [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- In 1993 Daimler-Benz AG 
(Stuttgart) increased the volume of its purchases in the new 
laender by 200 million German marks [DM] compared with the year 
before, thus reaching DM800 million. This exceeded the goal set 
by the company for itself by DM100 million despite the 
recession, Karl Engelhardt, chief coordinator for purchases in 
the corporation, stated at the Hannover Fair on Friday [22 
April]. The plan of buying goods and services for DM1 billion 
from eastern Germany by 1995 will certainly be fulfilled. 
  The corporation has a considerable advantage regarding costs 
by issuing orders in eastern Germany. Ancillary wage costs in 
the west are twice as high as in the new laender. The increase 
in purchases is a sign of the competitiveness of east German 
suppliers. The corporation is buying most in Brandenburg, 
followed by Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The northernmost land was able 
to increase its volume by 60 percent last year.

  [Text] Mainz (DPA) -- In the view of Mainz Interior 
Minister Walter Zuber (Social Democratic Party of Germany), 
Klaus Steinmetz, the former liaison official of the 
Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, was not involved in the attack on the new prison 
in Weiterstadt. "According to what I know of the 
investigations, Klaus Steimetz has a watertight alibi for the 
time of the deed," Zuber told the Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag 
on Friday [22 April]. The attack in spring 1993 caused material 
damage of about 130 million marks. 
  Concerning reports about the discovery of traces of 
explosives in the car of the liaison man, who became known in 
connection with the bloody antiterrorist operation in Bad 
Kleinen in June 1993, Zuber said that, according to experts, the 
substance is also used in other compounds. If only very small 
amounts are available, one can hardly distinguish between traces 
of explosives and traces of pharmaceuticals. Stienmetz put the 
authorities on the track of suspected Red Army Faction 
terrorists Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld, who were caught 
during the failed police operation in Bad Kleinen. Grams was 
killed during the action.

  [Text] Paris, April 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys today began a three-day official visit to France 
at the invitation of his French counterpart Francoise Leotard. 
  It is the first visit by the Czech Republic's defense 
minister to France since the division of the former 
Czechoslovakia. It aims to emphasize the new shape of 
French-Czech relations in the military sphere in the spirit of 
the agreement on cooperation between the two countries' armed 
forces which was concluded by France and Czechoslovakia in April 
1992 and which has been assumed by the Czech Republic, a source 
close to the Czech delegation told CTK. 
  Baudys, Chief of the Czech Army General Staff Jiri Nekvasil, 
Director General of the Defense Ministry Foreign Affairs 
Division Jaromir Novotny and other members of the delegation are 
discussing with their French colleagues the questions of 
European security and some specific forms of cooperation. 
  The delegation will focus on the preparation of French-Czech 
joint military exercises which are to be held in both countries 
this June. The joint exercises will mark a fundamental change 
in military relations between the Czech Republic and France. In 
the Cold War period the French Army was charged with the 
assignment of occupying the Czech lands in case of a war 
conflict. 
  During the visit Baudys will be shown French combat and 
communication equipment. He will visit, for example, a base of 
Mirage-2000 jets and the Matra firm. 
  At a meeting with Leotard this evening Baudys will discuss 
the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Czech participation in 
the celebrations to mark the Western Allies' landing in 
Normandia in 1944 will probably also be discussed.

  [Text] Paris April 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys met today with leading representatives of the 
French company MATRA who acquainted him with guided missiles 
Magique-2 and Mistral, the purchase of which is being considered 
by the Czech Army. 
  CTK learnt this from a source close to the Czech delegation 
led by Baudys which started a three-day official visit to France 
today. 
  According to the source, the Czech Republic has been 
maintaining close relations with MATRA since 1992. Experts and 
parliamentarians from both countries had agreed to test the 
Magique-2 missiles on MiG-23ML planes with which the Czech Army 
is equipped. 
  The relevant agreement was signed in January and the tests 
were carried out by Czech pilots on two MiG-23MLs from March 28 
to April 11 in France. The result was very good, the source 
said. 
  It also said that the two types of missiles were too costly 
for the Czech Republic and that Baudys only wanted to know 
conditions offered by MATRA. "Though the negotiations have 
progressed quite far, no trade agreement is in the offing. But 
it cannot be ruled out in the future," the source said. 
  The French party offers direct and indirect compensation for 
the missiles, the source said. "In case of direct 
compensations, the Czech Republic would produce mechanical parts 
for French guided missiles which would then be supplied to other 
countries," the source said. 
  Indirect compensation consist in supplies for MATRA's 
civilian programmes. The company produces Renault-Espace cars 
and MATRA-Hachette publishes books and magazines. 
  According to the source, the French recently supplied guided 
missiles to Finland, Norway and Austria in exchange for supplies 
of component parts for cars and of paper.

  [Text] Paris April 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys discussed means of drawing up military budgets 
and army modernisation programmes with chairman of the French 
Parliamentary Defence and Security Committee Jacques Boyon 
today, Baudys told journalists. 
  Cooperation with France was very interesting for the Czech 
Republic, Baudys said, because besides Sweden, France was the 
only country that was increasing its military budget for the 
purpose of modernising its conventional weapons. 
  The reason for the modernisation programme was not that 
France had outdated military technology but that "it realises 
that after the collapse of the bipolar world, that longed-for 
time when all of us head towards peace has not yet come. There 
are various pitfalls. They just want to be ready and have a good 
army, which is France's tradition," he said. 
  Baudys today began a three-day official visit to France at 
the invitation of his French counterpart Francois Leotard. 
  Baudys told reporters both countries were preparing for the 
first joint Franco-Czech military exercises, to be held in June 
this year. Beginning in the Czech Republic and continuing in 
France, they will represent a very good foundation for future 
cooperation and resume the interwar tradition of good 
Franco-Czechoslovak relations in the military sphere which were 
interrupted by the communist regime, he said.

Fabbri during visits to the Northeastern Military Command in 
Padua and the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force Headquarters in 
Vicenza on 20 April: "Fabbri: `We Are Defended by an Effective 
Shield'"] 
  [Text] Padua -- "I see no danger of attacks in Italy; there 
are no Serbian missiles that could hit our country. And an 
attack from the sky or the sea is inconceivable; we have a very 
effective protective shield." Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri 
played matters down: At the northeastern military command at 
Padua he thanked the soldiers who have defended our country over 
the past very difficult year. "Our country is NATO's aircraft 
carrier in Europe; the war in the former Yugoslavia has granted 
us a strategic role, and our international esteem has increased 
considerably," he said. The minister then went on to Vicenza, 
to the headquarters of the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force 
(ATAF). It is from this observation post that commands for 
military actions are issued. "NATO has shouldered all its 
responsibilities, but I think that it should have intervened 
even before the Gorazde massacre. I consider it very important 
and positive that Russia has issued an indication of its 
amenability by condemning the Serbs. However, I believe that 
the NATO forces cannot avoid, in the future too, taking all the 
measures necessary to end the massacre."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "GATT: Italian Farm Groups </F>
Criticize Accord"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 19 -- A drop in exports, the 
compression of farm income -- with its consequent expulsion from 
the productive cycle of tens of thousands of farming outfits -- 
thereby leaving more and more farmland fallow and unproductive 
are the negative repercussions Italian agriculture must grapple 
with because of the recent accord forged within the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Italian farm organizations consider this accord insufficient 
and in a joint communique, Coldiretti [National Confederation of 
Small Farmers], CIPA [Italian Confederation of Agricultural 
Experts], and Confagricoltura [General Confederation of Italian 
Agriculture] today insisted that the new international regime 
for farm products would prove deleterious for this primary 
sector in Italy and especially for those particularly 
Mediterranean products such as wine, olive oil, olives, fruit 
and vegetables. 
  These organizations are calling for a reform of the relevant 
joint market organizations within the European Union [EU] and 
revised guidelines which take into account the increase in EU 
resources that will be brought about by Community enlargement to 
include Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria.

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Party Secretary General Francisco </F>
Alvarez Cascos by Victorino Ruiz de Azua in Madrid on 14 April] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ruiz de Azua] Corruption is 
returning. Why now? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] It has not ceased to be present since the 
Socialist government with its parliamentary hegemony approved an 
anything-goes attitude and this was made clear with the Rumasa 
scandal. To try now to distinguish the Roldan affair or the 
Rubio affair from Filesa, Juan Guerra, or the reprivatization of 
Rumasa seems to me a mistake. They are manifestations of the 
same phenomenon, of the climate of impunity with which the 
Socialists have tainted the political atmosphere. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] And it suits you people very well.... 
  [Alvarez Cascos] It is very bad news for everybody. [There 
is] an atmosphere of unscrupulousness in the government's 
practice, and the feeling [exists] that it could generally harm 
the system's institutional prestige and affect us all. It 
grieves us, and it worries us increasingly, that Felipe 
Gonzalez's style of government has encouraged this. This is 
much more important than analyzing the consequences which could 
indirectly help the People's Party in its prospects. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] Do you have the impression that the 
government is cornered and is responding with difficulty? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] It does not wish to respond; there is a 
clear lack of political will. It is very unlikely that a spirit 
of regeneration capable of tackling the problem will emerge now 
from the same people who created the causes and were conducive 
to the breeding ground. The creator of a problem can never be 
the one who provides the solution, through lack of legitimacy 
and even of sincerity. In the first place, Gonzalez denied 
everything, and less than a year ago described Jose Maria 
Aznar's accusations as nonsense, and then concocted the line on 
ethics and the democratic impetus. Now he is aware that he is a 
prisoner of his actions and cannot lead the struggle against 
corruption. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] However, the government attorney's office and 
the Taxation Agency are investigating. There has been a 
response. 
  [Alvarez Cascos] The investigation has no credibility. Why 
only in the case of Mariano Rubio and not in all the others? It 
is simply advisable now, for image reasons, to pretend that 
steps are being taken in the wake of public indignation. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] When the People's Party calls on the prime 
minister to accept his responsibility, to what exactly is it 
referring? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] Gonzalez heads a collective government body 
which makes the decisions; he is not the apex of a presidential 
system whose responsibilities can be transferred to another, 
successive level. He is as responsible as the collective body's 
other members for the government actions and conduct. The great 
lie is to claim infallibility for oneself and dissociate oneself 
from collective responsibility in order to attribute it to the 
ministers. He has no right to call the ministers to account 
before the public; rather, he has a duty to account to the 
public for the actions of the ministers. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] Are you going to call him to account in the 
State of the Nation debate? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] We should not anticipate events or reverse 
the parliamentary order. In the first place, it is up to 
Gonzalez to explain the situation and its alternatives. 
Depending on that, the People's Party, as the leading 
opposition party, and Aznar, as its leader, will set out what 
they deem to be their duty. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] A year ago, you said: "Corruption can be 
ended in 24 hours." Apart from demanding heads, what can be 
done in opposition? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] That sentence can be repeated. Gonzalez 
has contributed to this situation because he has dissociated 
himself from all responsibility and allowed his government and 
party colleagues to act under the cloak of impunity, taking it 
for granted that to be a Socialist was a guarantee of ethics. 
These are demonstrable assertions. Here there has been a 
systematic and constant reduction of the objective checks and 
balances to prevent, correct, and prosecute irregular conduct. 
With the pretext of efficiency, ministers have been given 
greater discretionary powers to handle greater budgetary 
resources. In practice, the State Auditor General's Office 
neither oversees nor inspects anything. Gonzalez and the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party] recently rejected People's 
Party proposals to restore objectivity and oversight to 
government decisions. They want no checks; they wish to 
continue to operate arbitrarily. They wished to presume that a 
Socialist's hands were those of a saint, and now it is clear 
that they are as human as anybody's. Some people have already 
used this for their own advantage. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] The Socialists won the election thanks to the 
promise of the democratic impetus to bring openness to public 
life. What has become of it? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] The Socialists won the last election thanks 
to the last great operation staged by Gonzalez to nationalize 
the truth staged by Gonzalez. The supreme expression of the 
attempt to control everything is the intention to nationalize 
the truth through control of the public radio and television 
systems. Gonzalez's success was the great national deception by 
virtue of which he was able at the last minute to turn round a 
situation which was becoming irreversible; the country's ills 
would come from the opposition, which was going to lower 
pensions, cut unemployment benefit, and increase unemployment, 
while from him would come a social pact, full employment, and 
the guarantee of social stability. But, in less than a year, 
Gonzalez's stock has fallen considerably, his word is now 
virtually worthless, and his lies today are patent. There 
remains only an unconditional redoubt of supporters capable of 
following him in his lies. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] I was asking you about the democratic 
impetus. 
  [Alvarez Cascos] It has a great deal to do with this. We 
are the first people not to believe in the sincerity of those 
announcements, but we have acted in good faith, sat down at the 
table, and now we have exhausted the possibilities of reaching 
an agreement because society needs a regeneration of its 
institutions. Eventually we ran up against the wall of the 
obvious fact that the line was for everything to change so that 
nothing would change. Everything was reduced to a mere exercise 
of staying in power. Gonzalez is now a caricature of a leader 
seeking legitimacy of tenure. He undoubtedly has legitimacy of 
origin in the votes and support of CiU [Convergence and Union] 
and the Basque Nationalist Party, but a democratic politician 
legitimates himself every day by tackling citizens' problems. 
He has lost that legitimacy. His only effort is that directed 
at clinging to power. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] But the democratic impetus should have 
contributed something against corruption. Why has this not been 
possible? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] This has already become apparent. When we 
try to take a step forward in the functioning of the committees 
of enquiry in the Congress of Deputies, the Socialists, who 
hitherto had the guillotine of the majority to constrict these 
committees, wish to add another -- their coinciding with the 
judicial investigations. If we approved the PSOE's proposal, 
the Roldan committee would have to cease operating right now. 
Is that what society expects of those who proclaim the 
democratic impetus? 
  [Ruiz de Azua] It is striking how little you people have 
said about the PSOE congress. 
  [Alvarez Cascos] That is normal; we have referred only to 
matters which are of general interest. For instance, the 
worsening of the internal discord affects the government's 
stability and its ability to act. We do not involve ourselves 
with the internal confrontation. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] Do you have the impression that the 
Socialist congress opens up prospects for repairing the internal 
split? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] On the contrary, we are confronted with a 
process of a breakup of cohesion which may be dressed up as an 
ideological or power struggle but is a result of the widespread 
realization of failure. Today the PSOE is creating increasing 
disappointment. The disputes are a result of the feeling of 
failure and, at the same time, boost the strategy of defeat. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] While the government maintains that there is 
an economic recovery, you deny it. Can't you even agree on the 
objective economic facts? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] It seems to me that there is very little 
argument among the public about the fact that we are in the 
worst economic crisis since the restoration of democracy. We 
should not fall into traps. Gonzalez used to tell Adolfo Suarez 
he was incompatible with democracy because he was leading the 
country to 2 million unemployed: He cannot tell the country now 
not to scourge itself because it is reaching 4 million 
unemployed. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] But are we or are we not emerging from the 
crisis? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] The question is whether we live off other 
countries' inertia or also make our own contribution. There are 
positive signs abroad which will reach here, but the domestic 
economic policy is a deadweight. The public deficit was 
recognized long ago as the cancer of the Spanish economy, which 
has placed it at the head of the crisis in Europe. Well then, 
1993 is the year of the largest budget overshoots in the 
Socialist governments' memory. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] Your analysis is rather gloomy. Are you not 
afraid that such a negative view will end up harming the 
opposition as well? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] The worst thing that can be done to a 
country is to deceive it. As long as society is told that the 
government is doing everything possible and society resigns 
itself to living with the situation, nobody will take the 
necessary steps to emerge from the crisis. That is the People's 
Party's great responsibility -- to shake off any complex and 
tell the truth. That will be our legitimacy when we call for 
efforts or sacrifices. 
  [Ruiz de Azua] If you win the European elections and deprive 
the PSOE of its absolute majority in Andalusia, could there not 
be instability in the government? 
  [Alvarez Cascos] If we won, it would be the greatest support 
for the strategy which we have developed and our final 
confirmation as the winning party. On the government's 
stability, the question must be put to Jordi Pujol. Gonzalez 
governs every day on the time which Pujol gives him. How long 
will CiU endure the erosion? You must ask the CiU.

<F P=106> [Ian Rodger report: "Swiss Clean Up Rules on Dirty Money"] </F>
  [Text] Switzerland's private bankers have long tended to 
have a smug attitude to questions about accepting dirty money. 
  "We have always been extremely careful about who we will 
accept," one Geneva banker said recently. They say that even in 
the bad old days, when the famous anonymous numbered accounts 
were permitted, they always checked their clients' credentials 
thoroughly. 
  These claims ring rather hollow in the light of the latest 
case of dirty money -- a $150 million (102.7 million pounds) 
account at Union Bank of Switzerland [UBS] in Zurich held openly 
in the name of Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de Nasser, wife and 
partner of a suspected big-league Colombian drug dealer. 
  Swiss bankers now admit lamely that their screening of 
clients was perhaps not quite as rigorous in the 1970s -- when 
this particular account was opened -- and before as it is today. 
"We were not as sensitive to money laundering then," Mr Stephan 
Haeringer, a UBS director, conceded last week. 
  But bankers were surprised that UBS was the one caught out. 
Switzerland's largest bank is renowned for its careful scrutiny 
of potential customers. In the late 1980s, for example, UBS 
alone among the three large Swiss universal banks managed to 
steer clear of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, Olympia &amp; York, 
Omni 
and other big corporate groups that subsequently collapsed. It 
was also the first Swiss bank to refer the deposits of foreign 
politicians to the executive board. 
  The problem, Swiss bankers say, is one of Altlasten, a 
German 
word describing old deposits of toxic waste. All the 
well-established banks have accounts like that of Mrs Arana that 
were opened years before screening was tightened. And like 
concentrations of toxic waste, these accounts can explode at any 
time without warning. 
  The Swiss Federal Banking Commission's 1992 guidelines to 
bankers provide no fewer than 30 pointers to help them detect 
whether or not money is being laundered. But all of them have 
to do with transactions -- withdrawals, purchase of drafts, 
transfers or excessive cash movements. 
  If, as in the Arana case, the account lies virtually dormant 
for several years, it is more difficult for the bank's internal 
auditors to detect a problem. 
  The commission acknowledged the difficulty, saying that "it 
is not the banks' responsibility to investigate systematically 
all customer transactions for a possible connection to criminal 
activities." 
  That said, UBS's local competitors still have trouble 
understanding this case. They say that now banks have put 
customer accounts on computer files, it is not difficult to 
isolate all the Altlasten from, say, Colombia or Sicily for a 
special audit. Also, bankers say they now scan the newspapers 
for scandals and criminal activities out of fear that some of 
those involved are among their clients. 
  But the prevailing view among Swiss bankers remains rather 
fatalistic -- that a banking centre like Switzerland which 
specialises in attracting investment funds from rich individuals 
will inevitably also attract criminals. 
  "They have to place their money somewhere and they prefer to 
do it in the biggest and most efficient financial centres," a 
Swiss Bankers' Association spokesman stressed. 
  The Swiss doubt that they need further legislation to combat 
criminal money. In the past four years they have put in place 
what they believe is one of the best prevention and prosecution 
systems in the world. 
  Money laundering has become a criminal offence, which allows 
the Swiss police to co-operate fully with their foreign 
counterparts. 
  Bankers are obliged to know the real owners of all their 
accounts and are forbidden from accepting criminal money. 
Acceptance of such money through negligence is also punishable. 
  Later this year two additional legal reforms will complete 
the package, one permitting bankers to denounce suspected 
criminal clients to the police and the other making membership 
in a criminal organisation a criminal offence. This will enable 
the Swiss authorities to co-operate with Italy in Mafia 
investigations. 
  The one consolation arising from the latest case is that it 
showed that the Swiss, who often turned a blind eye to financial 
crime in the past, are now willing to move quickly when 
suspicions are raised. 
  Once the facts were known, the authorities froze the bank 
account and arrested Mrs Arana at her home near Geneva. 
  The Banking Commission and the Bankers' Association have 
already launched investigations of UBS's conduct, and the bank 
has suspended a vice-president responsible for the account. 
  The Swiss, at least, believe that the message to both banks 
and money launderers is clear.

  [Text] Athens (DPA) -- A bomb attack during the night was 
carried out on the branch office of the German Miele AG in 
Halandri, a suburb of Athens. The Greek police say that no one 
was injured. According to investigations so far, a bomb that 
had been put under a company van was detonated by remote 
control. When the car, which was parked on the company 
premises, exploded, the factory building of the German company 
was damaged. So far, none of the underground organizations has 
claimed responsibility for the attack. Material damage is 
considerable, it was said. 
  At the beginning of the week various terrorist underground 
movements had carried out attacks on three French and one 
Swedish diplomat in the Greek capital.

<F P=106> [Hugh Pope report: "Turks `Winning,' But Warned Over Kurd </F>
Rights"] 
  [Text] Istanbul -- Turkey may at last be winning its 
Kurdish conflict on the military front, diplomats say, as a 
result of massive operations in south-east Turkey and northern 
Iraq, tying down more than 300,000 Turkish troops and militiamen. 
  But diplomats and some influential Turks are warning that 
military success alone cannot end nine years of crippling 
insurgency. The key, they say, is a substantial recognition of 
Kurdish rights. The increasingly nationalist Turkish 
establishment has so far proved unable to take that step. 
  "Getting in is much easier than getting out," warned one 
Western diplomat. "We've seen all this in Algeria and Vietnam 
but the Turks think such parallels just do not apply to them," 
said another. 
  A Turkish spokesman said yesterday that 103 Turkish Kurdish 
guerrillas and six Turkish soldiers had been killed since 
several thousand Turkish troops crossed into a remote mountain 
area of northern Iraq on 12 April. Operations were continuing 
there on a front nine miles deep and 15 miles wide, as well as 
in two war zones inside south-eastern Turkey, he added. 
  "We are determined to remove all threats from the region. 
We'll continue for as long as it takes," said Colonel Dogu 
Silahcioglu, a spokesman for the Turkish army. Turkish 
newspapers have raised the possibility of a 10-mile deep 
security zone all along the border inside northern Iraq, from 
which guerrillas of the Workers Party of Kurdistan have been 
infiltrating Turkey. 
  One Western intelligence expert said the Turkish troop 
build-up has forced thousands of an estimated 10,000 guerrillas 
to flee to anti-Turkish countries such as Armenia and Greece, or 
to remote areas of Iran and northern Iraq. "The guerrillas have 
got their backs to the wall," he said. 
  Turkish experts believe new appeals for peace and talks by 
the Kurdish guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan, reflect this 
weakness. Mr Ocalan told the newspaper OZGUR GURNDEM he was only 
fighting for more Kurdish rights, not for an independent state 
for the 12 million ethnic Kurds of Turkey or the 20 million 
Kurds of the Middle East. 
  The Turkish General Staff apparently believes that Turgut 
Ozal, the late Turkish leader, made a serious mistake in 
sponsoring a March 1993 cease-fire, which saved the guerrillas 
from a planned offensive. Many officers believe that the local 
population must simply be made to fear the army more than they 
fear Mr Ocalan's guerrillas from the Workers Party of Kurdistan 
(PKK). 
  The President, Suleyman Demirel, has made ambiguous hints of 
constitutional compromise. The Social Democrats, the junior 
partner in the coalition government, are trying to link 
long-promised Kurdish liberalisation to economic reforms. But 
the position of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is weak, and she 
seems unable to think differently from the military. 
  Not everybody is hard line. Some influential Turks think it 
is time to move on from the blanket denial of the Kurdish 
identity, started by the country's founder, Kemal Ataturk, after 
the first modern Kurdish revolt in 1925. 
  "The whole military initiative has passed into military 
hands," said Gungor Mengi, the chief commentator of the 
newspaper SABAH. "To make this victory permanent we must accept 
the Kurdish identity. This is the only way to isolate terror 
from the people." Amnesty International is concerned about the 
fate of Kurdish activists. It cited a case on 9 April of two 
men in the main Kurdish city of Diyarbaki, ordered to be 
released from police custody by a court. Instead they were found 
shot dead in a field four days later. 
  Western powers have soft-pedalled their criticism because of 
Turkey's parlous finances and a perceived role as a Western ally 
in a tough neighbourhood, threatened by Russian ambitions and 
Islami fundamentalists. That may not last for ever. "I find 
many of my Turkish friends extraordinarily complacent about 
human rights abuses," Michael Lake, the representative of the 
European Commission, said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Delcroix Wants European </F>
`Intervention Force'"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- Federal Defense Minister Leo Delcroix 
wants a "flexible and smooth operational system of cooperation 
between European armies to resolve conflicts." He avoided the 
term "intervention force." Delcroix proposed the idea yesterday 
during a rush visit to his French counterpart Francois Leotard 
in Paris. On 9 May, both ministers will defend the proposal at 
a meeting of the Western European Union (WEU) in Luxembourg. 
  Yesterday, Delcroix thanked his French counterpart and the 
French Army for the good cooperation during operation "Silver 
Back" in Rwanda. "This cooperation was quickly set up on site 
and led to the almost perfect running of the evacuation 
operation in Rwanda. That was an 18 carat performance. These 
initiatives will surely be rewarded in coming weeks." 
  Delcroix and Leotard also learned lessons from the events in 
Rwanda. "An important question came up during our meeting: How 
do we resolve similar problems in countries where we are not so 
well equipped and where there are not so many Belgians? I put 
forward the idea of a flexible, smooth operational system of 
military cooperation. I would not call this an intervention 
force since our country does not have the resources to keep a 
lot of people abroad on a permanent basis." 
  "Nor do we want laborious UN procedures. In order to avoid 
delays and bureaucratic confusion, we must have just a few 
people come together to make decisions. My colleague, Mr. 
Leotard, was delighted with the proposal." 
  As regards the withdrawal of the intervention force from 
Kenya, he warned against being too hasty. "We must hasten 
slowly. The intervention force cannot camp out for weeks, but 
there is still a lot of equipment to be brought back. That 
demands a lot of logistical work. In addition, we want to see 
if everything is running smoothly in the surrounding area."

  [Excerpt] Hamburg/Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The British Prime 
Minister John Major does not think the planned European monetary 
union will come about. In 1999, Europe will "not yet be ready 
for a common currency," Major said in an interview in the news 
magazine DER SPIEGEL. This view was "not a piece of British 
chauvinism, but an economic assessment." 
  The prime minister stressed his skepticism was due to the 
"anticipated economic repercussions." If Europe had a common 
currency in 1997, 1998, or 1999 as planned and it was to 
succeed, then "all European economic cycles would have to have 
become closer to each other and be working efficiently." Major 
added: "I know no one who says this can be anything like 
achieved. There will therefore be no monetary union." 
  Meanwhile Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) announced that 
he wanted to reduce the German contributions to the European 
Union (EU) in the long term. The Federal Government was taking 
all promising steps to improve the German situation, Waigel told 
the B.Z. [BERLINER ZEITUNG]. It was "entirely indisputable that 
an imbalance in burden-sharing has arisen." This was all the 
truer since "Germany is now only in seventh place in the EU 
prosperity stakes following unification." 
  Waigel pointed out that the German net contribution was 
around 25 billion German marks [DM] this year. Germany was 
therefore covering around 70 percent of the net transfer between 
the member states. In 1994, Germany would pay out around DM44 
billion to the EU. Some of this would flow back in the form of 
payments to German agriculture or as support for eastern 
Germany, for example. But Germany's direct EU expenditure was 
further augmented by its contribution to ease the burden on the 
second largest net contributor, Great Britain. This cost 
another DM1.2 to 1.5 billion. 
  Major conveyed his irritation at the criticism expressed by 
the EU parters of his stance on the dispute over blocking 
minorities and veto rights in the EU Council of Ministers and 
accused them of applying double standards. If necessary, 
Germany and France as well as Spain or Italy would defend 
"everything they perceive as questions of national interest." 
But no one accused them of being anti-European for that.

correspondent Frederic Francois; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Francois] Was it appropriate for Belgium, as a 
former colonial power, to send UN blue helmets to Rwanda? 
  [Dehaene] We ultimately decided to send troops for several 
reasons: First, because of the UN's insistence; second, because 
of the demand by the parties to the Arusha agreements; and 
third, because we had played an active role in negotiating those 
agreements. I believe that we made the right decision then, but 
now that the Arusha agreements have been followed by a wave of 
violence, we must learn the lessons. Nevertheless, at the time 
of the UN decision [to send troops], I believe that our choice 
was justified. 
  [Francois] Is Belgium contemplating a withdrawal from 
Africa? 
  [Dehaene] No, I do not believe we should make conclusions 
influenced by our emotions. Rather, we must give ourselves some 
time to reflect upon the UN operations and our African policy. 
We nevertheless must define a new African policy, a new 
development policy, and I have promised the members of 
parliament that we would do so in cooperation with them.

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F>
political staff] 
  [Text] There are "encouraging" signs about the situation in 
Gorazde, although it remains tense, Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd said today. 
  His comments came after a United Nations spokesman confirmed 
that while Bosnian Serbs were still in their positions around 
the Muslim enclave, it had been largely quiet since a 1am 
deadline for them to withdraw or face air strikes. 
  No immediate NATO air strikes were ordered against Bosnian 
Serb forces around the UN-designated safe area because they were 
complying with the ultimatum to withdraw, said the UN. 
  Mr Hurd told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It is obviously still a 
tense 
situation, but the signs this morning are a bit more encouraging 
as to what is actually happening on the ground. 
  ``Air strikes are not an end in themselves. The threat is 
there to bring about a result, to stop the killing in Gorazde by 
the Serbs and to get the Serbs out. 
  ``We have got a ground effort run by the UN with British 
troops, we have got an air effort run by NATO with British 
planes. Those two efforts clearly have to work together.'' 
  But he conceded: "There was a failure at Gorazde, we are 
seeking to retrieve that failure by the joint efforts of NATO 
and the UN." 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said any decision 
to 
withdraw troops would have to be taken by the UN Security 
Council. 
  "I am in favour of maintaining our presence, to continue to 
work on the ground until we find a solution to this problem," he 
told the BBC TV Breakfast with Frost programme. 
  He admitted the UN been humiliated in Gorazde, adding: "But 
this is one setback -- you must see it in the context of 
situations where we have been successful, in Cambodia, El 
Salvador and elsewhere." 
  Meanwhile, the UN relief agency was today planning to 
airlift 
600 wounded people from the town, as 400 British and French 
troops were due to set out from Sarajevo to join a 200-strong 
contigent already deploying along the Gorazde confrontation 
lines. 
  Elsewhere, General Andre Soubirou of the UN Protection Force 
was holding meetings with Bosnian Muslim and Serb military 
commanders in and near Gorazde.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel (FDP) [Free Democratic Party] welcomes the NATO ultimatum 
to the besiegers of the Bosnian town of Gorazde as "correct and 
necessary." The Western community thus demonstrates that it is 
not prepared to accept the "Bosnian Serbs' continual violations 
of international law," Kinkel said in Bonn today. At the same 
time, the Western community said it was not prepared to accept 
developments like those in Gorazde in other parts of Bosnia. 
  It is necessary, "alongside the military measures," to get 
the negotiating process into motion again, said Kinkel. The 
United Nations, the European Union, the United States, and 
Russia were jointly called upon to take a fresh initiative to 
get the warring parties to the negotiating table.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Nordic Natural Gas Network </F>
`Utopia'"] 
  [Text] Sweden will be able to develop its natural gas 
network only on the basis of strictly commercial principles, and 
if those principles are followed, it will not be possible to 
make natural gas pay its way. That makes Sweden the missing link 
in a Nordic natural gas network, and a network supplying Finland 
with Norwegian natural gas will not come into being. 
  That is the conclusion drawn by Danish researcher Niels Moe 
of the Trade and Technology Development Board (NUTEK) in 
Stockholm. 
  Moe has drawn up a report for the Nordic Council of 
Ministers 
on "energy policy as planned and in actuality in the Nordic 
countries." The views in that report are Moe's own, however, and 
were not discussed by the Council of Ministers. 
  And disagreeing with Moe completely is the Council of 
Ministers' information group on gas issues, which is to submit a 
report of its own to the council next fall. The attitude toward 
a Nordic natural gas network is more positive within that group. 
It feels that there is in Sweden a disguised energy requirement 
that is not yet being talked about because many questions 
surrounding the phasing out of nuclear power are unanswered. At 
any rate, more and more political initiatives in favor of 
natural gas are now appearing in Sweden. 
  Niels Moe also notes in his report that the political 
attitude toward natural gas has recently turned more favorable 
in Sweden. But while it is easy to show political will, it is an 
entirely different thing to actually implement a decision on 
natural gas, he says. 
  "As I see it, the matter has actually already been decided," 
says Moe. "There will not be a Nordic natural gas network. A gas 
network requires new infrastructure, Sweden is big and sparsely 
populated, and it is very hard to make gas pay today. It is not 
enough to express political will; one must follow up those 
expressions of will with other measures." 
<H5>  No Champion </H5>
  At the moment, there is no champion -- no company or 
combination of companies -- that would exploit natural gas in 
Sweden. Getting a gas project going in central Sweden would 
require such a champion, and if no Swedish champion can be 
found, there may be a possibility that foreign interests would 
step into the Swedish natural gas market. 
  The advocates of natural gas feel that the entire gas issue 
must be looked at from a longer perspective, even though 
concrete decisions are gradually becoming more and more urgent. 
The Norwegians will be forced within a couple of years to decide 
where to export gas from the new Haltenbanken field: to the 
Nordic Region or to Germany and Central Europe. 
  The possibility that the Nordic countries will join the 
European Union (EU) is also placing the gas issue in a new 
light. The EU is offering support for the construction of new 
infrastructure, meaning, for example, a gas pipeline. The same 
support may be considered for Finland when the decision on a 
pipeline from the Stockmanovskoye field in northern Russia is 
made. 
<H5>  No Market in Sweden? </H5>
  Niels Moe is very pessimistic about the Swedish market for 
gas. There is no market in Sweden that would be big enough even 
if electricity production were based on natural gas, he feels. 
In today's situation, a Nordic natural gas network amounts to 
unrealistic wishful thinking. 
  It is not just the Swedish market for natural gas that is 
too 
small, according to Moe. There is also a possibility that 
natural gas use in the network already developed in Finland will 
not be as high as expected. In a situation of free competition, 
there may be many suppliers in Finland offering cheap energy -- 
district heating plants and thermal power plants, for example -- 
to today's big users of natural gas. The government's policy of 
facilitating the market position of gas through environmentally 
motivated energy taxes may improve the position of gas, Moe says. 
  Moe also discusses Finland's other energy sources in his 
report, pointing out that Finland has an all-round supply with 
many different energy systems and a concentration on many 
different fuels that, combined with a well-developed district 
heating system, provide it with good opportunities for 
converting to environmentally friendly energy systems. But 
Finland's rejection of additional nuclear power will cause 
discharges of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon dioxide to increase. 
  Finland has supported the use of domestic fuels such as 
peat, 
Moe notes in his report. But with a deregulated energy market in 
Finland, the danger exists that firms will choose the cheapest 
way to produce energy, and in today's price situation, that 
favors the use of oil and natural gas over domestic fuel 
production.

  Athens News Agency reported today from Washington that 
according to U.S. evaluations, the lengthy meeting of the U.S. 
President with the prime minister gave the opportunity to the 
two leaders to reconfirm the excellent bilateral relations and 
analyze further the prospects of cooperation in light of the new 
international conditions, particularly in the Balkans. 
  Washington is convinced--the U.S. President has made it 
clear 
to the prime minister--that the White House considers Greece the 
most stable country in the region that can play an important and 
leading role in the Balkans. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Zafer Kiraz </F>
in the TRT studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Kiraz] As the foreign minister of a NATO member 
country what information have you received? What is the latest 
situation in NATO regarding Gorazde and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
general? 
  [Cetin] As you know the attacks on Gorazde, which started at 
the end of March, have gradually been directed against the 
civilian population despite all efforts to put an end to the 
aggression. I had a conversation with the Bosnian prime 
minister today. It is reported that over 90 persons, including 
women and children, were killed yesterday. Naturally, we, from 
the very beginning have taken initiatives involving the UN 
Security Council and NATO. At long last a few days ago, on 18 
April, the UN secretary general asked NATO to take action just 
as had been the case regarding Sarajevo. The meetings have been 
continuing for the last few days. The issue was again discussed 
in Brussels today. We have stressed that the issue of Gorazde 
is most urgent. There are four other safe havens. We thought 
that it was necessary to take an urgent decision concerning 
Gorazde. A decision was reached earlier this evening regarding 
Gorazde. Since all other efforts have not yielded any results 
it has become necessary to use force again. NATO is issuing an 
ultimatum regarding Gorazde. The ultimatum is as follows: All 
Serbian weapons and forces in Gorazde will be withdrawn three 
kilometers by tomorrow midnight, that is 0300 Turkish time. All 
humanitarian aid will be able to get into the city easily. The 
NATO decision also specified the borders of the Gorazde safe 
haven in order to avoid any confusion. The region within a 20 
kilometer radius from the city center is defined as the Gorazde 
safe haven. Heavy weapons or military positions within this 20 
kilometer radius will be bombed through coordination to be 
established between the UN forces and NATO. 
  This is an important decision. A new phase has thus been 
reached in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I hope that the Serbian 
officials will realize the significance of this decision and 
abide by the ultimatum without further fighting. Otherwise, it 
is clear that NATO will carry out its ultimatum because Gorazde 
is being attacked for the last 20-25 days. These attacks are 
directed against the civilian population. This decision also 
constitutes a significant step towards a lasting peace and 
cooperation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The UN secretary general was informed of this decision and 
it 
has gone into effect. If any shots are fired within the next 24 
hours in specified regions, if the civilian population of 
Gorazde is attacked within that 20 kilometer radius then NATO 
forces will be to take action. The NATO meeting will resume in 
a while to discuss the remaining four safe havens. A decision 
will be reached regarding those regions as well. In other 
words, there is a draft decision concerning Zepa, Srebrenica, 
Tuzla and Bihac. NATO will discuss that tonight and a decision 
is expected. 
  [Kiraz] We sincerely share your wishes. As you have 
stressed, NATO is, this time, decided and serious about its 
ultimatum. There is no turning back. 
  [Cetin] This decision was adopted unanimously by 16 
countries. Among them the United States, Turkey and other 
significant European countries. This is a serious decision. 
NATO has a credibility and a prestige to maintain. NATO has 
been patient. The United Nations has been patient. The Serbs 
have tried to gain time. They used this time not to attain 
peace but to move into Gorazde and to increase their attacks 
against the civilian population. I hope that they will abide by 
this serious and significant NATO decision without any further 
bloodshed. 
  [Kiraz] We also share you hope.

  [Text] Austrian President Thomas Klestil said Kashmir is 
disputed territory and as such it should be solved through 
negotiations between India and Pakistan. Talking to a visiting 
Pakistani delegation led by Nawabzada Nasrulla Khan, chairman of 
the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, in Vienna, he said 
the Austrian Government gives top priority to human rights. He 
said he is fully aware of the Kashmir dispute and will raise his 
voice against human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. 
  Earlier, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan briefed the Austrian 
president about the prevailing situation in the occupied 
territory. He asked the Austrian head of state to use his 
influence with other European countries to help resolve the 
dispute in accordance with UN resolutions.

<F P=106> [Report by Dieter Kindermann: "New Border Police in the </F>
Fight Against Illegal Refugees and Criminals"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak is 
determined to establish a border police consisting of 4,000 to 
5,000 men that are to be recruited from the rural police and 
customs officers. After Austria's entry into the European Union 
[EU], their major task will be to control the 1,200-km external 
EU border with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, 
and other countries. 
  Loeschnak, who flew to the Nikolsdorf border crossing on 
board a Bell Augusta-type police helicopter, stated: "The 
control of the border by the police, customs officers, and the 
Army has proven successful but is no permanent solution. Thus, 
the historic opportunity that is opening up after entry into the 
EU should be used to establish a uniform border police." 
  In the event of EU membership, controls at the border with 
Germany and Italy would no longer be necessary. Redundant 
customs officers might be incorporated into the border police. 
Currently, 3,800 customs officers are being asked whether they 
want to continue to be employed by the Finance Ministry or 
whether they want to join the border police. Loeschnak 
mentioned the following major reform goals: 

  -  The equipping 
of border control offices with computers to make it easier to 
call up data of wanted persons. 
  -  Enabling the new border police 
to slowly reduce the deployment of the Army at the 
borders. 
  -  Strengthening the border police in the fight against 
crime and illegal refugees.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Thomas Chorherr: "Balance Sheet of a Visit"] </F>
  [Text] Chancellor Vranitzky's visit to the United States 
may not have taken place at the best of times. The world 
political events may have stolen his show and developments at 
home may have ruined his mood. The fact that CNN switched from 
a photograph of Bill Clinton and the Austrian chancellor to the 
president's news conference is only a weak consolation, or is it 
not? In fact, Bosnia was discussed during Vranitzky's visit to 
the White House, which was also the topic if Clinton's 
subsequent news conference. 
  However, the way Clinton commented on Bosnia and what has 
happened since then shows in an impressive manner that he still 
has not realized what is happening in the Balkans. When asked, 
Vranitzky gave a diplomatic reply, as is right and proper for a 
visitor. However, there is no need for us to be diplomatic. 
The President tried to convince his compatriots via the media 
and the world via CNN that a civil war is going on in Bosnia. 
He repeatedly stressed that a "civil war" is taking place 
there. Yet this is not true. We are not witnessing a civil war 
among members of the same nation. It is a war between different 
ethnic groups, states, and religions. 
  If Clinton wrongly speaks of a civil war, he is evoking a 
trauma that the Americans have not overcome since 1865 -- for 
good reason. At the same time, he also asked for understanding 
for Washington's hesitant attitude. "Not interfering" is the 
motto, which would be justified if a civil war were really 
involved. What Clinton had to offer was a stalling policy. An 
international conference on Bosnia is to be held -- as early as 
in four weeks -- according to Yeltsin's wishes. A state will no 
longer exist by that time, but there will be a winner who can 
rightly claim that he won against the whole world. 
  If Vranitzky tried to explain this, his visit was a failure 
in this respect. If he failed to do so, he should have stayed 
at home.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Livia Klingl: "Discrepancy Between Words and </F>
Deeds"] 
  [Text] "Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have basically 
reached agreement." At first glance, this piece of news gave 
rise to hope one day after the speech by the President, who is 
acting rather lucklessly in the sphere of foreign policy, on the 
situation in Bosnia. Yet the reputations of the United States, 
of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of NATO are 
linked to this speech. 
  One may have gotten the impression that Russia has now also 
adopted a tough stance vis-a-vis the Serbian troops. Yet 
agreement has only been achieved with the unwilling and would-be 
superpower on the convening of an international Bosnia 
conference. 
  It is obvious that it will take some time to ensure the 
participation of all major politicians and of the Serbian 
leaders that have been made important by these major 
politicians. It is equally obvious that Bosnian civilians will 
die in the meantime. 
  In an initial reaction, the nationalist leader (or seducer) 
Karadzic was "unimpressed" by Clinton's initiative. After all, 
the obstacles on the path toward a more massive military strike 
by NATO have remained the old ones: Blue berets would become 
hostages -- as recent events have shown on a small scale. Much 
weightier is the argument of military officials that soldiers 
have never surrendered to an aircraft, and that the war cannot 
be won without ground troops. 
  The U.S. leader, who may have been genuinely outraged by the 
Bosnian atrocities, has reacted to public pressure. However, 
his initiative can only be effective if the allies really 
cooperate. Possible consequences that no Western head of state 
has been prepared to risk so far, would have to be accepted. 
  Clinton's statement that "we must judge the Serbs by their 
deeds and not by their words" must also apply to the community 
of states. The Serbs have been using this motto for a long time. 
When the ultimatum for Sarajevo was adopted -- the only one 
that was taken seriously by the world -- they were even 
impressed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "Rau.": "Will to Leadership"] </F>
  [Text] NATO has decided after all in favor of an ultimatum 
to the Serbs to leave Gorazde and the other "protection zones" 
or else Serbian positions will be bombed. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton seems to have finally brought himself to push this 
through NATO. 
  No matter how much Bill Clinton rejects this, Bosnia is 
becoming a touchstone for his leadership abilities. The 
situation in the former Yugoslavia is extremely complicated and 
risky. However, it is the job of the U.S. President to take 
resolute action and risks if necessary. 
  The Clinton Administration has given way to local chiefs of 
bandits in Haiti and Somalia. If it does not cope with the 
Bosnian Serbs -- even if it were to withdraw while giving 
weapons to the Muslims -- the judgment on its competence will be 
passed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mild Recession in Austria"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- Austria overcame the international 
recession in 1993 more effectively than neighboring countries, 
the Economic Research Institute (Wifo) reported yesterday. At 
0.3 percent, GNP dropped much less than that of western Germany 
(1.9 percent). 
  Austrian industry reacted quickly to the declining orders 
from abroad. It reduced production by 3 percent and investments 
by one-fifth. A total of 6.5 percent of all jobs were lost in 
industry in 1993. Consumption and the construction industry had 
a stabilizing effect. 
  The recession left clear traces in the budget, however: At 
98 billion schillings, the budget deficit was twice as high as 
planned.

  [Excerpts] Get out of Gorazde! NATO has once again given 
an ultimatum to the Serbs. [passage omitted] Listen to the 
reaction of Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in Nancy 
yesterday, speaking to Olivier Schneid: 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe] Last night's decisions by the UN 
Security Council following the French initiative asking the 
Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde, should be followed by actions. 
When persuasion fails, force should be used. I think, 
therefore, it is logical that NATO should provide the United 
Nations with the means it requested in order to enforce 
international law. I would also like to say that we should not 
reduce our diplomatic efforts. 
  [Shneid] Isn't this ultimatum a bit late? 
  [Juppe] You can always say that but it is here today. Now we 
will have to implement it. We should be aware of the risks 
involved, however, including risks to ourselves and to our 
soldiers. [end recording]

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in 
Nancy, stressed the need for the NATO ultimatum: 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe] The Serbs must now carefully 
consider their responsibility. They must commit themselves to 
de-escalation and they must understand that the negotiating 
process remains constantly open. They must therefore stop their 
attacks, their shelling, their killing. Once more, everyone 
must sit around the negotiating table. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you agree with Prime 
Minister 
Balladur, who said yesterday evening that what is now happening 
in Gorazde is shameful? 
  [Juppe] Obviously. This is why we have fully committed 
ourselves to obtain an end to all this. I remind you that the 
UN Security Council resolution is a French initiative which was 
passed by a unanimous vote, including the Americans and the 
Russians. We later supported the idea of a more robust 
commitment by the Atlantic Alliance. The proposal for a summit 
between the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the 
United Nations is a French idea put forward by the president of 
the Republic and the government several day ago. I hope that we 
will also move forward in that direction. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Paris, April 25 (AFP) -- International policy on 
Bosnia must combine a determined military stance with diplomatic 
doggedness, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Monday [25 
April] in Paris. 
  "We must be firm on the ground and we must be strong-willed, 
I would even say stubborn, to get a diplomatic process that 
works" in Bosnia, Juppe said in a radio interview only hours 
ahead of a meeting in London with his British and U.S. 
counterparts Douglas Hurd and Warren Christopher. 
  The three top diplomats are meeting to prepare talks of the 
three major powers, the United States, Russia and the European 
Union, as well as the United Nations, to define a common policy 
on the Bosnian question. 
  The goal is finally to tell the warring Bosnian parties "to 
come to the negotiating table and talk seriously," Juppe said. 
  Juppe said Bosnian Serbs have acted "savagely, and continue 
to do so, in Gorazde" but that the international community could 
pressure the Bosnian Serb's sponsor Serbia with sanctions "which 
hurt and which should continue to hurt." 
  Juppe said an overall settlement in Bosnia should be based 
on 
the European plan for the former Yugoslav republic to become a 
viable state with institutions that loosely join the Serb, Croat 
and Moslem communities. Territory should also be divided up "in 
order to end the dialogue of the deaf in which we have been 
stuck for months and months." 
  He added that what has happened at Gorazde showed that the 
international community was reacting too slowly and that this 
should be corrected in the future. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, April 23 (AFP) -- An estimated 7,000 people 
marched through Paris Saturday [23 April] to protest the Bosnian 
Serb shelling of the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  Marchers were jeered by a group of around 80 Serb protestors 
denouncing what they called a "witch-hunt" against Bosnian 
Serbs, and police had to intervene to separate the two sides. 
  The march, called by around 20 human rights groups and 
trades 
unions, was led by a number of personalities including writers 
Bernard Henri Levy, Daniel Rondeau and Pascal Bruckner. 
  Organizers said 7,000 people took part in the march. Police 
put the attendance at around 1,200. 
  Demonstrators chanted "Weapons for Bosnia" and "UN, why do 
you let them (the Moslems) be killed?" 
  They called for the use of all means, including military, to 
save the town, which came under renewed Bosnian Serb shelling 
Saturday in defiance of Friday's ultimatum from the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation to halt their offensive immediately 
or face air strikes.

  [Excerpts] Late last night in New York, the United Nations 
decided to cut back on its mission in Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
Many nonaligned and African nations have criticized this 
decision. The Rwandan ambassador to the United Nations wondered 
why the United Nations was cutting back on its presence in 
Rwanda while in other difficult situations, like Bosnia, it was 
bolstering its forces up to 30,000 men. We spoke earlier to 
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, Burundi's interim president, who 
deplored the departure of the UN peacekeepers from Rwanda and 
reminded the United Nations that human rights knows no race. 
[passage omitted] 
  Many people feel that the international community is 
abandoning the Rwandans to their fate. A moment ago, we asked 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe if the West, and France in 
particular, had decided to abandon Rwanda: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] Not at all. You know that diplomatic 
efforts are under way, particularly in Uganda, to restart the 
Arusha process; in other words, to work toward reconciliation 
between the various parties and toward setting up a government 
that can share power. A project has been drawn up with this in 
mind. It was necessary to adjust the strength of the UN force 
in Rwanda, UNAMIR, in order to take account of the situation on 
the ground. France was insistent that UN activity should not be 
interrupted, but it has been suspended. It will be able to 
resume once we have moved forward in talks about a cease-fire 
and a return to the Arusha accords. [end recording]

Support for the Opposition in Paris"] 
  [Text] On a visit to Paris since Monday 18 April, Jalal 
Talabani, who is joint chairman of the "Presidential Council" of 
Iraqi Kurdistan (virtually autonomous since it was placed under 
international protection), will ask France to ensure that the 
Iraqi Government is forced to implement Resolution 688 passed by 
the UN Security Council in April 1991 (at France's initiative), 
which demands that Baghdad respect human rights. 
  To this end, France and the other members of the UN Security 
Council must, in Talabani's opinion, adopt the following 
approach: "Send UN observers to Iraq (against Baghdad's wishes 
-- LE MONDE editor's note), increase the isolation of the Iraqi 
regime by forcing it from international bodies, and bring Saddam 
Husayn, in absentia if necessary, before a court for crimes 
against humanity." 
  But Jalal Talabani admits that what he is advocating is 
difficult to achieve, particularly because the international 
community at present has other priority concerns, especially 
following its failure in Bosnia. However, he expects the 
members of the Security Council to "give political, moral, and 
financial support to the Iraqi opposition and to the formation 
by that opposition of an Iraqi coalition government which would 
have its seat in Irbil," the capital of Kurdistan. He stressed 
that such a government should only be formed if it enjoys prior 
international support. "Then," he said, "the Iraqi Government, 
which is already totally rejected by the entire population, 
irrespective of background, will fall." Mr. Talabani is 
convinced of it. 
  In the same way, he is convinced that France, Russia, and 
China will not oppose the embargo imposed on Iraq by the 
Security Council since the Gulf War. He maintains that 
everybody, including the oil companies which are currently 
negotiating with the Iraqi authorities, knows that the Baghdad 
regime is politically and economically bankrupt. 
  It would be nice to admit that he is right, but even THE NEW 
YORK TIMES recently suggested that it was time for the United 
States to review its attitude "in the direction of a possible 
end to the military and economic confrontation" with Baghdad. 
Mr. Talabani admits that there is no absolute guarantee that 
the isolation of the Iraqi regime will be maintained, but he 
states that the opposition is determined to make every effort to 
ensure it is continued, or even strengthened, and leads to the 
fall of Saddam Husayn. Meanwhile, Mr. Talabani wants 
international aid to Kurdistan "no longer to be in the form of 
humanitarian gifts, but aid to rebuild the infrastructure." He 
also asked for the lifting of sanctions on some products which 
are "essential for rebuilding and for getting industry working 
again." Finally, he expressed the hope that the Western 
protection of Kurdistan since April 1991 will continue and will 
no longer be subject to a six-monthly extension as is currently 
the case. The Kurds have been making these demands for a long 
time. In vain. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jalal al-Talabani, the leader of the Kurdistan 
Patriotic Union, one of the Kurdish parties in Iraq, was 
received by Francois Mitterrand this morning. The Kurdish 
leader earlier met Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe. This is not the first time Jalal 
al-Talabani has been received in Paris. If he was worried by 
the recent contacts between Paris and Baghdad, he must now feel 
reassured. More details now with Olivier Dalage: 
  [Dalage] Jalal al-Talabani must be satisfied with his trip 
to 
France. The co-chairman of the self-governing Iraqi Kurdistan 
government -- a government self-proclaimed against the Baghdad 
government following the Gulf war -- was received by the most 
important French leaders. Alain Juppe expressed his support for 
respect of Kurdish rights, including respect of their political 
rights, in the framework of Iraq's territorial integrity. For 
his part, the Kurdish leader repeated his plan for a federation 
incorporating broad autonomy of Iraqi Kurdistan in the framework 
of the Iraqi state. The French foreign minister and his 
colleague Defense Minister Francois Leotard both gave assurances 
that France would continue its participation in Operation 
Provide Comfort to protect Iraqi Kurds north of the 62d 
parallel. If Jalal al-Talabani was somewhat apprehensive when 
he arrived following recent contacts between Paris and Baghdad, 
he was told by Juppe not take any notice of rumors because 
France will continue its embargo as long as Iraq will not 
observe all the UN Security Council resolutions.

  [Text] Hendaye, France, April 22 (AFP) -- Trawlermen in 
southwest France agreed Friday [22 April] to halt their anchovy 
expeditions for the time being, ending a week-long "anchovy war" 
with Spain, a regional official told AFP. 
  The trawlermen accepted a seven-point agreement proposed by 
the regional governor which gives them a special monthly 
unemployment benefit of 4,500 francs (775 dollars) until they 
resume anchovy fishing in June. 
  Some of the fishermen complained about being paid a welfare 
benefit "when we only want one thing, to work." 
  The ships will continue to fish for white fish and an agreed 
400 tonnes of anchovies, according to a statement issued 
Thursday by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 
  The trawlermen had blockaded Thursday the port of Bayonne to 
protest about "discrimination against their right to work" and 
police seized nets from nine French trawlers to keep them from 
sailing, following threats by Spanish vessels to sink any French 
ships trying to catch the fish. 
  The dispute, between 60 Spanish and 12 French vessels, 
centres on their alloted quotas. The French quota is 2,700 
tonnes a year and the Spanish 27,000 tonnes. 
  Violence broke out at the start of the week, with Spanish 
boats from the port of Fuenterrabia attacking French trawlers 
for exceeding their quota, hurling petrol bombs and trying to 
board them. One boat, the Laetitia, was seized and held in 
Fuenterrabia but was returned Friday. 
  The regional government said it will pay 1.2 million francs 
(210,000 dollars) towards repairs of two trawlers damaged during 
the Spanish attack.

  [Text] Belgian troops will not take part in any more UN 
peacekeeping forces for several months at least. This was 
announced by Leo Delcroix, the Belgian defense minister, who met 
his French counterpart Francois Leotard in Paris today. 
  "If we are called upon for new missions, I think we will 
abstain for a certain period of time. We need several months to 
recover from the events." The minister was certainly referring 
to the death of ten Belgian UN peacekeepers in Rwanda. 
  Leo Delcroix said he would reexamine the situation in the 
autumn, but, he said, Belgium will not withdraw from missions 
currently underway, in particular in ex-Yugoslavia.

  [Text] France is granting 200 million CFA francs to Congo 
to ensure public security in Brazzaville. The Congolese 
interior minister has just presented a plan designed jointly by 
Congo and France to reform the security forces. Here are more 
details from Assane Diop: 
  [Begin Diop recording] Soldiers and policemen must be able 
to 
cope with new forms of violence without killing people while 
maintaining law and order. This is one of the Congolese 
interior minister's objectives. Congo has called on France to 
train its security forces. The French Police Department for 
International Cooperation Service will be in charge of the 
project. The head of the department, Jean-Louis Ottavi, visited 
Brazzaville recently. French experts will first audit the 
current operations of the Congolese security forces. These 
operations were the object of controversy following the bloody 
clashes which have recently pitched supporters of the president 
and the opposition against each other. The security plan, which 
has just been announced, will cost thousands of millions of CFA 
francs, the Congolese minister said. Congo will finance the plan 
with French support. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The 28 March Paris daily LIBERATION 
published the results of a poll conducted on 18-19 March by the 
BVA organization on behalf of France 2, France 3, Europe 1, 
PARIS MATCH and LIBERATION among a representative sample of 968 
individuals over 18, with a commentary by Eric Dupin. 
Respondents were asked their views on the government one year 
after its accession to power. 
  "Taking everything into account, do you consider [Prime 
Minister] Balladur's balance sheet very positive, rather 
positive, rather negative or very negative?" 
  Only 3 percent replied "positive," with 46 percent choosing 
"rather positive." Some 37 percent said "rather negative" and 13 
percent replied "very negative." Only 1 percent did not know. 
  According to Dupin, while the above results are fair, public 
opinion becomes more severe when government action is examined 
in more detail: 
  "For each of the following areas, tell me if you believe 
that 
the Balladur government's action over the past year has rather 
improved or rather aggravated the situation?" 
  French action in the former Yugoslavia: 60 percent 
thought it rather improved the situation, 25 percent that it 
rather aggravated it, 1O percent that it remained the same, and 
5 percent did not know. 
  The defense of the franc in the European Monetary 
System:57 percent thought it rather improved the situation, 
21 percent that it rather aggravated it, 11 percent said it 
remained the same, and 11 percent did not know. 
  Clandestine immigration:45 percent thought it 
rather improved it, 35 percent that it rather aggravated it, 12 
percent that it remained the same, and 8 percent did not know. 
  Efficiency of the justice system:4O percent said 
that it rather improved it, 4O percent that it rather aggravated 
it, 15 percent said it remained the same, and 5 percent did not 
know. 
  The general state of the French economy:39 percent 
thought it rather improved it, 46 percent that it rather 
aggravated it, 11 percent saw no difference, and 4 percent did 
not know. 
  Security in cities and suburbs:33 percent said it 
rather improved it, 5O percent that it rather aggravated it, 14 
percent said it remained the same, and 3 percent did not know. 
  The general state of the education system and of 
schools:29 percent thought that it rather improved it, 50 
percent that it rather aggravated it, 17 percent saw no 
difference, and 4 percent did not know. Level of taxation: 27 
percent said that it rather improved it, 59 percent that it 
rather aggravated it, 12 percent that it remained the same, and 
2 percent did not know. 
  Policy on unemployment:26 percent thought that it 
rather improved it, 59 percent that it rather aggravated it, 13 
percent saw no difference, and 2 percent did not know. 
  Social Security and pensions:26 percent said that 
it rather improved it, 59 percent that it rather aggravated it, 
13 percent saw no difference, and 2 percent did not know. 
  French agriculture:22 percent thought it rather 
improved it, 66 percent that it rather aggravated it, 8 percent 
that it remained the same, and 4 percent did not know. 
  Problems of poverty and exclusion:2O percent said 
that it rather improved it, 64 percent that it rather aggravated 
it, 14 percent saw no difference, and 1 percent did not know. 
  Social climate in France:13 percent thought it 
rather improved it, 78 percent that it rather aggravated it, 8 
percent saw no difference, and 1 percent did not know. 
  Purchasing power and standard of living:12 percent 
said it rather improved it, 65 percent that it rather aggravated 
it, 22 percent that it remained the same, and 1 percent did not 
know. 
  "Balladur has been prime minister for one year. Would you 
say 
of his government that it..." 
  ...respects the obligations it assumed during the 
electoral campaign or not? 
  Some 52 percent said it does, 42 percent said it does not, 
and 6 percent did not know. 
  ...equitably assigns the efforts demanded of the French 
people or not? 
  Some 31 percent said it does, 66 percent said it does not, 
and 3 percent did not know. 
  ...acts on the spur of the moment or follows a definite 
policy? 
  Some 49 percent said it acts on the spur of the moment and 
49 
percent that it follows a definite policy; 2 percent did not 
know. 
  ...goes too far in the field of reforms, does not go 
far enough, or conducts reforms at a good pace? 
  Some 3O percent thought the government is going too far, 36 
percent said it was not going far enough, 29 percent said reform 
is taking place at a good pace, and 5 percent did not know. 
  Respondents were also asked to rate ministers' performance. 
They gave the highest rating to Minister of Interior Charles 
Pasqua, whose performance was approved by 60.7 percent. Pasqua's 
lowest rating came from respondents aged 25-34 (52.9 percent) 
and his highest rating (71.6 percent) came from respondents over 
65. Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil received an overall 
approval rate of 44.7 percent, and Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Alain Juppe achieved a rating of 42.2 percent. Minister of 
Defense Francois Leotard received an approval rate of 40.7 
percent. 
  At the lower end of the rating scale were Minister of 
Finance 
Edmond Alphandery, with an approval rate of 7.6 percent, 
Minister of Industrial Development Alain Madelin (9 percent), 
Minister of Labor Michel Giraud (9.5 percent) and Minister of 
Public Works and Transportation Bernard Bosson (9.8 percent). 
  Another question was related to the performance of the 
opposition. Respondents were asked the following questions: 
  "For each of the following parties, tell me if it has played 
its opposition role in the past year very well, rather well, 
rather poorly, or very poorly?" 
  With regard to the Communist Party (PC), 6 percent answered 
"very well," 26 percent "rather well," 37 percent "rather 
poorly," 26 percent "very poorly," and 5 percent did not know. 
  With regard to the PS, 4 percent answered "very well," 34 
percent "rather well," 43 percent "rather poorly," 17 percent 
"very poorly," and 2 percent did not know. 
  Concerning Generation Ecologie, 4 percent answered "very 
well," 28 percent "rather well," 42 percent "rather poorly," 21 
percent "very poorly," and 5 percent did not know. 
  With regard to the Greens, 3 percent answered "very well," 
28 
percent "rather well," 43 percent "rather poorly," 21 percent 
"very poorly," and 5 percent did not know. 
  Concerning the National Front (FN), 6 percent answered "very 
well," 20 percent "rather well," 31 percent "rather poorly," 38 
percent "very poorly," and 5 percent did not know. 
  "Do you think that the PS has an alternative policy it can 
propose to the French people?" 
  Some 30 percent said "yes," compared to 68 percent who said 
"no" and 2 percent who did not know. 
  "In light of the social difficulties, do you think that, if 
the PS were in power, it would do better or less well than the 
present government?" 
  Some 21 percent said "better," 53 percent said "less well," 
24 percent said "the same," and 2 percent did not know. 
  Dupin adds that Balladur cannot use cohabitation with 
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand as an excuse for his 
government's "limited action." In fact, 88 percent of the 
respondents believe that "in general, cohabitation between 
Mitterrand and the prime minister has functioned smoothly," 
compared with only 11 percent who think the opposite. In the 
view of 52 percent of the respondents, "Mitterrand's presence 
has braked Balladur's policy little or not at all." 
  It is surprising that in spite of the multiple problems the 
government endured during its first year, cantonal elections 
results were fairly favorable for Balladur, Philippe Reinhard 
commentsin the 29 March Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. However, it is 
not certain that the government will be able to resist much 
longer, he continues. Balladur is aware that more difficulties 
await him, especially in the areas of the economy and 
employment. While the future is "less than radiant" for the 
prime minister, he does possess a trump card, namely, the fact 
that he is perceived as "different" from all other politicians. 
Even if slowly declining, his popularity remains "exceptional," 
as if no alternative to him exists in the voters' mind. One year 
after his election, the prime minister is "paradoxically both 
threatened and serene," Reinhard concludes.

<F P=106> [Report by Sophie Benard report: "Monory Criticizes </F>
Balladur"] 
  [Text] The Senate speaker had some harsh words for the 
government yesterday. His main target was the prime minister. 
  Rene Monory likes to act the part of the unbiased observer. 
Lapses in self-censorship are not unheard of, however. 
Sometimes his rather grouchy disposition resurfaces. Such was 
the case yesterday during a press luncheon during which he 
directed a good many criticisms toward Edouard Balladur's 
policies. 
  To be fair, Rene Monory does have cause for irritation. The 
regional decentralization bill scheduled for discussion in early 
July will not come before the Senate first. While the interior 
minister had promised publicly that senators would be given the 
first reading of the bill, Edouard Balladur has now issued a 
statement to the contrary, which suits National Assembly 
President Philippe Seguin just fine, but quite infuriated Rene 
Monory: "This is not a question of pride or precedence between 
the two assemblies. I just note that the government has not been 
true to its word," he fumed. Mr. Monory thinks that senators 
can legitimately expect to be given the first reading of the 
bill, since after two years of work under the direction of 
Jean-Francois Poncet (RDE [Democratic and European Rally], 
Lot-et-Garonne), they had become the bill's true initiators. 
"The government's attitude has a direct consequence: The bill 
has now been made toothless or, at the very least, discredited," 
thundered Rene Monory. "This is a difficult bill, which 
initially nobody can be pleased with since its positive impact 
will only be felt in the longer term. Only the Senate can 
shoulder this kind of unpopularity. National Assembly members 
are not in a position to do this due to electoral constraints. 
As a result, most of the effort put into the bill may now go to 
waste. This was a fine idea which foundered because of too many 
successive errors." 
  There was more to come, however. When the Senate president 
feels the need to vent his aggravation, he does it 
steamroller-style. He went on to criticize the general 
political climate, which has been getting on his nerves: "It is 
all getting rather suffocating, is it not? Instead of remaining 
ostensibly reticent about it, would-be presidential candidates 
should step forward," he stated, steering well clear of anything 
remotely resembling a denial of the rumor which would have him 
enter the presidential race should [former President of the 
Republic] Giscard throw in the towel. An ambition that may 
explain his tactical ill-temper. 
  The slight economic recovery which the government is 
perceiving does not impress him either: "Whatever the hope for 
renewed growth, no fundamental change will have taken place as 
far as employment is concerned," he explained. As for the 
government's employment policies, he feels there is room for 
improvement: "Obviously, the five-year employment act falls way 
short of what is needed. Its shortcomings are legion." 
  In short, Rene Monory likes everything in Edouard Balladur's 
policies, apart from those concerning jobs, the economy, and 
regional decentralization. 
  By way of conclusion to this onslaught, Rene Monory went for 
the jugular in a roundabout sort of way, insisting that Edouard 
Balladur has "the status of a statesman who may possibly lack a 
little something."

<F P=106> [Article by Luc Dettier: "East Asia: Seduction </F>
French-Style"] 
  [Text] France's profile in Asia is too low! At a time of 
unprecedented growth in this region, the French presence there 
remains too marginal, despite the media attention given to some 
industrial contracts, such as Airbus or Alcatel-Alsthom, and the 
activities of some small and medium-sized enterprises, such as 
Gemplus, Sopha Medical, or Cisigraph. 
  In a bid to promote French industries in the region, the 
Ministry of Industry, Post and Telecommunications, and Foreign 
Trade has just launched a massive project called "French 
Initiative For Asia", just a few days after the restoration of 
the traditional French cooperative links between France and 
China. The aim is to raise Asia's share of French exports from 
the present 7 percent to 10 percent over the next five years. 
This wide-ranging venture, pivoting around 10 actions, targets 
the region as a whole, from Pakistan to New Zealand, and 
particularly the rapidly developing Far East: China, Hong Kong, 
Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the ASEAN [Association of South-East 
Asian Nations] countries: (Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei). 
  All the experts agree on one point, their consensus 
supported 
by a recent World Bank report on the Chinese economic area: The 
21st century will be the "Asian century." This report's 
conclusions, founded on very cautious hypotheses, are that by 
the year 2000 the China-Taiwan-Hong Kong triangle could account 
for 6.5 percent of global trade (including internal trade). By 
2030, this zone will account for 12 percent of global GDP, or 
around the same as the then figure for the United States or 
Japan. 
  Economic expansion, which has abandoned Europe, has already 
moved to the Far East. Between 1986 and 1990, Korea, Thailand, 
Taiwan, and China had real annual average growth rates of 10.2, 
9.9, 8.8 and 8.1 percent respectively. Unfortunately, France's 
market share ranged, depending on the country, between 1 and 4 
percent of imports (apart from Vietnam, where the figure is 6 
percent). The average figure for the region is 2 percent, or 
one-third of France's overall global market share and, 
crucially, well below the figure for France's major partners. 
It should be borne in mind that Germany's performance in 
south-east Asia is twice as good. 
  France's performance over investments is even more modest: 
Its share of foreign investment is 0.7 percent for the 
Philippines, and 2.5 percent for Singapore. 
  There are, however, a few signs of improvement. In 1992, 
French exports to the Pacific Rim rose to 86 billion French 
francs, or 7 percent of our total exports, doubling the 1980 
figure. Furthermore, besides the significant reduction in our 
trade deficit with newly industrialized countries, the value of 
French exports to Asia rose by 14.5 percent in 1993, compared 
with a 5-percent reduction in exports to the rest of the world. 
There were particularly noticeable increases in Malaysia (plus 
63 percent), China (plus 23 percent), Hong Kong (plus 34 
percent), India (plus 21 percent), and Singapore (plus 33 
percent). 
  The French authorities have for some years been actively 
encouraging companies' activities in this promising region. For 
instance, it receives around 40 percent of total development 
aid, and a quarter of the total funding provided by COFACE 
[French Company for Guaranteeing Foreign Trade]. Besides joint 
financing by several supporting bodies whose job is to find 
local partners for joint ventures (OCIFA [expansion unknown] in 
Indonesia and Taiwan, APRODI [expansion unknown] in South Korea, 
Malaysia, and Thailand), there has been significant 
strengthening of local teams. The transfer of DREE's [Management 
of External Economic Relations] resources to the Ministry of 
Industry, Posts and Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade, has 
enabled the number of organizations geared toward economic 
expansion in the Pacific Rim to rise to 32. 
  However, political leaders consider it is now time to fight 
back against our traditional competitors -- hence the launch of 
the "French Initiative for Asia" program. One of the program's 
strongest thrusts is the organization in 1994 of two entirely 
French events in East Asia. These are intended as a 
high-technology shop windows, with an emphasis on industrial 
goods. The first takes place in Taiwan at the start of July, 
with the second in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) in November. These 
are free-standing events, rather than being based on a local 
trade fair or exhibition. The project's second phase, starting 
in 1995, will also feature three French exhibitions of consumer 
goods. To support these ventures, a major public-relations 
campaign will be launched in 1994/95, featuring the distribution 
throughout the region of a brochure entitled "High Tech, High 
Touch: France," available in both English and Chinese, in 1994. 
This brochure, already issued in Japanese and Korean, has been 
completely updated. 
  Structural measures designed to produce effects in the 
medium term have also been taken. These include both strong 
budgetary mobilization of the bodies which promote foreign trade 
(CFCE [French Foreign Trade Center]; CFME [French Committee for 
Economic Events Overseas]; ACTIM [Technical, Industrial and 
Economic Cooperation Agency]) and of the procedures which 
provide existing trade with financial support, and the 
development of a policy for Asia in the energy and 
telecommunications fields. 
  The Industry Ministry also plans to fund the creation of a 
business center in Singapore to host French small and 
medium-sized enterprises and industries. This project, under 
which support for economic development will be sought from 
partners operating internationally (regions, professional 
organizations, international chamber of commerce) is currently 
the subject of a feasibility study. A decision should be made 
by 30 June. 
<H5>  The Ten Actions Under the French Initiative for Asia </H5>
  1. Measures taken by CFCE over the rapidly developing Asian 
market to be tripled within three years. 
  2. A quarter of CFME's credit to be oriented towards Asia. 
  3. 30 percent of ACTIM's credit to be oriented towards Asia. 
  4. Priority for financial procedures for supporting trade in 
east Asia. In particular, the Codex procedure to be 50 percent 
dedicated to this region from this year. 
  5. Expansion of major French events in Asia. 
  6. Intensification of public relations campaigns in Asia to 
promote French industry and technology's image. 
  7. Project to launch a French business center for French 
small and medium-sized enterprises in Singapore. 
  8. Project for framework agreements for joint investments in 
Asia. 
  9. Launch of an Asia telecommunications program. 
  10. Intensification of French presence in the energy sector 
in Asia. 
  EDF [French Electricity] and GDF [French Gas] will propose 
an 
active international strategy in the countries concerned by 30 
April.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of </F>
France, by Jean-Pierre Robin; place and date not given: 
"Jean-Claude Trichet: `Interest Rates Will Continue To Drop'"] 
  [Text] [Robin] The Bank of France has become independent. 
In particular, we expected this move to give the bank a greater 
credibility vis-a-vis the markets, thus leading to the 
possibility of lower interest rates. Has this hope been 
realized? 
  [Trichet] The Bank of France and its Monetary Policy Council 
[CPM] have been independent since the law of 4 August was 
completed by the law of 31 December. It appears to me that the 
franc has benefited by obtaining an increased level of 
credibility on all markets. The independence of the central 
bank has increased the reliability of a stable monetary policy 
required by law, and this has enabled us, for example, to halve 
interest rates since the start of 1993. The world and national 
markets must be convinced that the wise men on the CPM, charged 
by law with ensuring price stability, are making their decisions 
in all honesty and with the sole aim of respecting the law in 
the interests of our economy. 
  [Robin] Has not defending the franc within the European 
Monetary System [EMS] become an overriding priority, to the 
detriment of all other considerations? 
  [Trichet] The problem cannot be viewed that way. The law 
requires that we ensure price stability. Successive governments 
have attached a great deal of importance to the EMS exchange 
rate mechanism. The work of the CPM is aimed at the following 
strategic goal: The final objective is price stability -- less 
than 2 percent in future years. On the basis of that, our 
initial, intermediate aim is to ensure the stability of the 
external value of our currency in the framework of the EMS 
exchange rate mechanism, as confirmed by the ministers and 
[central bank] governors of the European Union [EU] on 2 August 
1993. We also have a domestic monetary aim: the simultaneous 
monitoring of the M3 monetary aggregate and of the preferential 
indicator of total domestic borrowing. 
  Leaving aside this technical explanation, I would like to 
make one very simple point: The CPM has clearly defined 
monetary policy for 1994 and the coming years in the context of 
noninflationary growth. This noninflationary growth had yet to 
appear by January 1994, the last time we met. It is more 
apparent now, as we can see from the INSEE [National Statistics 
Office] and Bank of France surveys. For five months now, since 
November 1993, company bosses have been telling our surveys that 
the economic climate is improving. 
  [Robin] Is monetary stability compatible with rapid economic 
growth? 
  [Trichet] Yes. I even think, if you take a step back and 
look at the situation, that it is a precondition for rapid 
growth. Anyway, there is not a single central bank governor who 
will state that he is implementing a weak or unstable monetary 
policy and who is not in favor of domestic monetary stability. 
I do not know anyone who would say that. 
  [Robin] Even in the United States? 
  [Trichet] Naturally, the Federal Reserve is no exception. We 
are living in a world system which even applies to the countries 
of the East and the former Soviet Union. We are really in a 
globalized system: If you deliberately project an image of 
weakness, you will immediately and quite rightly pay the price. 
Any investor in Tokyo, Singapore, or New York would be entitled 
to claim a "risk bonus" from a country that tells him he will be 
paid in an unstable currency! A responsible monetary strategy 
in the current world, and also in the French and European 
context, consists in supplementing economic policy with domestic 
and foreign currency stability. At the end of the day, this is 
the most effective way of obtaining the best level of investment. 
  [Robin] For the Bundesbank, the stability of the German mark 
is seen as a function of a basket of 18 currencies. France, 
then, has to ensure the franc-mark parity. Do you not think 
that there is a degree of inequality between the positions of 
the two countries? 
  [Trichet] No. The criterion that we use is membership of the 
multilateral European exchange rate mechanism, which unites nine 
economies and eight different currencies. Germany is a member, 
too. We have striven to externalize French monetary strategy -- 
as we have always done -- by stating our two objectives: an 
external aim, i.e., the exchange rate mechanism decided on by 
the EU governors and ministers on 2 August, and a domestic aim. 
Some countries go about it differently. That does not prevent 
these nine economies, including the French and the German 
economies, from participating in a multilateral system. It is a 
balanced system where all the countries obey the same rules. 
  [Robin] Since it became independent, is not the Bank of 
France even more subjugated to the Bundesbank? 
  [Trichet] The CPM defined France's monetary policy for 1994 
in Paris, and makes its decisions on the basis of this policy in 
accordance with the law and in the interests of the French 
economy. In Frankfurt, the Bundesbank committee does the same 
thing for Germany. 
  [Robin] At the current time, all European bond markets, and 
especially the French one, are suffering from the rise in U.S. 
interest rates. Is there not a way we could avoid this domino 
effect? 
  [Trichet] All the markets have been caught up in the storm 
blowing in off the Atlantic. If we again take a step back, we 
see that the 10-year rates in France are 35 basis points off the 
German rates and 10 basis points off the Netherlands rates. In 
the general torment, the best performers so far have been the 
Germans, followed by the Dutch, with the French in third place. 
  I have confidence in the main features of the French 
economy: 
low inflation, a foreign trade surplus, and healthy growth. I 
am convinced that the markets, after an understandably shaky 
period, will, as they have always done, take these objective 
factors into account since they argue the case for France and 
for Europe. 
  [Robin] Can the European central banks continue to cut their 
key rates in this world context? 
  [Trichet] The best way forward is to maintain a credible 
policy of monetary stability. You cannot navigate through a 
storm on a policy of instability. In these conditions, the 
European central banks can continue to cut their key rates if 
necessary, in a gradual and cautious way, and despite the rise 
in U.S. rates. This is the message that the governors of the 
European central banks have already sent out, notably Hans 
Tietmayer and myself, at last month's Frankfurt seminar. 
  [Robin] In the letter that the governor of the Bank of 
France 
traditionally sends to the president of the Republic along with 
the bank's annual report, you express your concern about the 
size of the budget deficit. Is this your way of warning the 
government? 
  [Trichet] The French Government, like all its European 
counterparts with the exception of the Luxembourg Government, 
has launched a medium-term budgetary recovery program. This is 
a good move which I applaud. I am convinced that this 
multiannual program will be methodically applied because it is 
important for the French economy. It is not a question of 
overdramatizing the situation: Our government debt today 
represents 44 percent of GDP, which is quite low compared with 
the European average. However, it is one more reason for us to 
maintain this relative advantage! 
  [Robin] You say that the Bank of France's monetary strategy 
makes it possible, under the conditions of the world market, to 
have the lowest possible interest rate curve across the whole 
range of maturities. Does the level of short rates not 
constitute another handicap, especially for small- and 
medium-sized companies which have no other means of financing? 
  [Trichet] This strategy of credibility and stability which 
does indeed take into account the whole range of interest rate 
curves, is definitely the strategy best suited to the country's 
investment requirements. Look at the situation: For our 
economy to be as active as possible, many observers or experts 
agree that housing and investment are important activating 
factors. 
  In both cases, in France, financing at long- or medium-term 
fixed rates plays a key role: 90 percent of housing loans are 
made at long- or medium-term fixed rates. These are two 
excellent reasons for having a relatively low interest rate 
curve for long-term maturities, and this is indeed the case in 
France compared with other countries. 
  Moreover, French households are net creditors, while, in 
many 
countries, they are debtors. When short-term rates drop, 
household incomes tend to fall. I do not think that that is an 
argument against cutting short-term rates, which are clearly 
also useful for the economy. However, this side of things has 
to be taken into account when you compare our monetary policy 
with other possible policies. 
  Naturally, it is still true that our monetary policy has 
also 
made it possible to cut short-term rates significantly over the 
last 12 months by 600 base points, and that has helped small- 
and medium-sized companies and industries [SME-SMIs]. 
  [Robin] These SME-SMIs are now complaining more than ever of 
a lack of credits. Does this not risk compromising the recovery? 
  [Trichet] Some polls show that only 7 percent of managers 
complain about the cost of credit, much fewer than a year ago. 
The problem is therefore perhaps more about gaining access to 
credit than its actual cost. Of course, the central banks 
cannot be held responsible for that. However, the public 
authorities have thought about it and [Economics Minister] 
Alphandery has taken steps in this area. I am thinking 
especially of the guarantees accompanying SOFARIS [French 
Venture Capital company] loans, which could prove extremely 
useful at the current time. 
  [Robin] Are you optimistic about the signs of economic 
recovery that has begun in France? 
  [Trichet] The basic signs are good: We have a good rate of 
inflation and a large trade surplus, which means that the French 
economy is restarting in very healthy conditions. 
  [Robin] The government debt, however, is increasing and, 
above all, a major share of it is held by foreign investors, 
which could frustrate a further reduction in interest rates. 
  [Trichet] You have to look at our situation in the overall 
context. The total government debt, which is 44 percent of GDP, 
places us in a very favorable position with regard to the rest 
of Europe and the world. 
  As for French securities (public and private shares and 
bonds) held by non-French nationals, they prove the 
international nature of our economy. We are the world's fourth 
largest exporter, the third largest per capita among the G-7 
countries, and one of the leading foreign industrial investors. 
The French operate very much on the international level and 
perform very well, even if they do not always realize it. This 
neither brakes nor accelerates rate cuts. It simply means that, 
like all other major economies, we are involved in an 
interdependent worldwide system. 
  [Robin] Tight monetary policy equals unemployment. How do 
you respond to this question? 
  [Trichet] The countries that have been implementing a policy 
of monetary stability the longest are today those that are 
industrially the most powerful and who have experienced the 
highest overall growth: Germany and Japan. France itself, 
since it has had this kind of monetary policy, has equaled the 
best levels of growth over a long period. 
  The real question is different: Why does French growth not 
create more jobs? This is an extremely complex problem which 
does not directly arise out of monetary policy. We have to show 
more imagination and make more of an effort to change our 
behavior in a number of areas so as to create more jobs for each 
"1 percent" of extra growth. 
  [Robin] How do you explain the intense and continuing public 
criticism of monetary policy? Do you sometimes get the 
impression that the political world regrets ever having made the 
bank independent? 
  [Trichet] Such criticism is rather a healthy factor in a 
democracy. Anyway, it proves that we are indeed independent! 
The worse thing for the franc would be if the Bank of France 
looked servile, if people sung our praises left and right, which 
would mean that the CPM was not really independent. That would 
run counter to the law and the interests of the country, since 
our independence was decided to increase the credibility of the 
franc. 
  It is therefore a good thing that the bank appears so 
independent. However, the independence of the CPM does not mean 
we have cut off all contact between the bank and public 
officials, the president of the Republic, the prime minister, 
the economy minister, and Parliament. On the contrary, these 
relations are scrupulously defined by the law and are essential. 
  Moreover, in a democracy it is the duty of every institution 
to listen, reflect, decide, explain, and, if possible, convince. 
The Bank of France's CPM will strive to listen as much as 
possible to the messages of our economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Eric Leser and Carole Monnot: " French-Type </F>
Pseudo-Capitalism"] 
  [Text] The new wave of privatization 
confirms the locking in of the leading groups. Neither "Rhenish" 
nor "Anglo-Saxon," the "financial heart" is controlled by a 
caste drawn from the civil service. 
  Edouard Balladur had solemnly promised that his government, 
at the head of public companies and future privatized ones, 
would not lead a witches' hunt. This time, the composition of 
the well-known "hard core" of the groups placed on the market 
would be beyond question. In short, the new wave of 
privatization would be unassailable. 
  Six months after the transfer of the BNP [National Bank of 
Paris] to the private sector, the first grand style operation, 
we must accept that reality does not actually match with what 
was said. To be sure, all the bosses of the public groups were 
not dismissed immediately after the majority changed. To be 
sure, community rules make it theoretically mandatory to leave 
the door opened to investors of European Union countries. But 
the game does seem to be played in private among people 
belonging to the same world, between former denationalized 
companies and future privatized ones. The game was played in 
four rounds. 
  1982-1983: In addition to the leading institutions--BNP, 
Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale--and the insurance companies 
that had already been nationalized since 1945, the Left in power 
nationalized some hundred banks, including the two investment 
banks (Paribas and Suez). The leading French industrial groups 
(the former CGE [General Electricity Company], which since then 
has become Alcatel-Alsthom, Saint Gobain, Bull, Thomson, 
Pechiney, Rhone Poulenc, Matra, Usinor and Sacilor) passed under 
state control. 
  Four years later, having assumed power, the Right privatized 
a first wave of companies, Suez, Saint Gobain, Matra, Havas, the 
Societe Generale, and Alcatel-Alsthom--according to the "hard 
core" technique. A subtle balance fell into place among groups 
regarded as playing a pivotal role--such as Alcatel, Societe 
Generale and Havas. But in the autumn of 1987, the stock market 
crash brought the privatization program to a halt. Once again 
in power, the Socialists, for budgetary reasons, authorized 
cross-shareholding investments. Unable to appeal to the 
financial market and state capital endowments being rare, the 
public groups, looking for a capital base, increased mutual 
equity investments, which offered the double advantage of not 
involving state control once again and of bringing in fresh 
money. 
  In the spring of 1993, the UDF [Union for French 
Democracy]-RPR [Rally for the Republic] coalition was back in 
business with an extremely ambitious privatization program. For 
convenience--why start all over again when drafts have already 
been formulated over a period of some 10 years?--or for 
political will, not only did the woven common interests remained 
intact, they resurfaced stronger. 
  The government was able to rely on an untouched base: The 
privatized companies of 1986-1987 that had held on to their 
teams and shareholders. The only attempt undertaken by the 
Socialists to break up the hard core--the assault decreed in 
1989 by Pierre Beregovoy against the Societe Generale--ended up 
in defeat and brought out new common interests. 
  STABILITY - As a rule, the stability of the leadership in 
the 
privatized groups is much higher than that of public leadership, 
and even private, companies. It is so true that we can wonder if 
there is not legislation unique to the privatized companies, 
legislation which derives from the logic of neither public nor 
private logic, but from the method used, that of the hard core, 
the only calling of which would be to isolate French capitalism. 
  Behind the popular success of the spectacular privatization 
of the BNP, Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine, the prime minister 
shapes the ties, balance of power, and alliances among the 
largest of the French groups. 
  The choice of standard chairmen and shareholders always 
obeys 
a very specific logic, namely, the gradual implementation of a 
all powerful "financial elite," lead by a limited circle of 
former top civil servants with an homogeneous social and 
political profile. First observation: For the most part, groups 
being privatization find their shareholders among the privatized 
companies and those capable of being privatized. 
Cross-shareholding investments between leading recently 
privatized groups, and those invited to do so, make it possible 
to manage the scarcity of capital, but they are aimed primarily 
at protecting the groups from the possible hunger of foreign 
capitalism. 
  In fact, the Generale des eaux, the Lyonnaise des eaux and 
the AXA insurance company, which are the only exceptions, are 
allowed to share the economic power, but not in the best 
positions, these being reserved for the denationalized companies 
of 1986-1987 (Saint Gobain, the Societe Generale, Parisbas, and 
Suez) and 1993-1994 (BNP, UAP [Paris Insurance Union], and 
Elf-Aquitaine). The privatization of the UAP, planned for the 
very near future--and of the anticipated privatization of AGF 
[General Insurance of France] --gives its final coherence to the 
patiently implemented system. A new French-style capitalism is 
taking shape. But is it really new? Interwoven with the state 
since World War II, its nature has not really changed. There is 
no English-style market capitalism, no German-style 
bank-industry and no Italian-style network of powerful families. 
It is a "financial core" capitalism, actually rather close to 
the Japanese system. Have the "50 buddies" replaced the 200 
families, as claimed by the opposition? 
  The creation of groups of stable shareholders is more 
attuned 
to a give-and-take logic than to real economic motivations. A 
given industrialist will accept participation in the capital of 
his principal banker or insurer who is also one of his 
shareholders. Who is the BNP's main shareholder? The UAP. Who is 
the UAP's main shareholder? The BNP. 
  Similar combinations link the Societe Generale to 
Alcatel-Alsthom, the Societe Generale to Rhone-Poulenc, Saint 
Gobain to Suez, Saint Gobain to the BNP, the UAP to Elf 
Aquitaine, and in time, they will link the UAP to Elf-Aquitaine, 
and Paribas to the AGF's. No true "godfathers" stand out against 
these mutual obligators. It would more likely involve a group of 
baronies forced to compromise with each other. For Jacques 
Friedmann, "companies gravitate toward each other, sharing 
common interests in addition to their capitalistic ties." If the 
division of these groups is hazy, their interests do not 
necessarily meet. 
  INFLUENCE - Despite the stronger powers given to the 
Privatization Committee in 1993, influence continues to be a 
factor in French privatization. Some people claim that they are 
being totally controlled. The state nominates the chairmen, 
imposes its choice in the matter of stable shareholders and, in 
fact, decides who the members of the board of directors are to 
be. Elie Cohen, a CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research] 
researcher, is critical of this: "France is the only country in 
the world where the state nominates in advance the shareholders 
who will hold the real economic power. It is the reverse channel 
of capitalism, the public authorities, and the leaders whom they 
have appointed, choose influential shareholders who place the 
market before the accomplished fact." Even the Italian 
privatization process--which ignores the hard-core system--is 
far more liberal! 
  The French system is all the more locked in as the leaders 
are drawn from the same pool, namely, the higher public 
offices--the Inspectorate of Finance and the leading government 
agencies; between 1986 and 1988, these individuals also often 
worked in ministerial cabinets--the whole system bound by a 
common political thought. The profile of these members is 
thoroughly homogeneous. In no way does it resemble that of the 
entrepreneurs and captains of industry. 
  Elie Cohen states: "No difference is made between appointing 
bosses to head the public companies and choosing men to lead 
privatization. But in the first case, what a government does, 
another can undo. In the second, it involves incorporating a 
biased connection into the bedrock of capitalism." The 
government is developing from privatization a closed circuit 
control of the leading French groups. Corroborating this 
statement are, among other examples, the efforts used to secure 
the appointment of Jacques Friedmann, a very close adviser of 
Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, as head of the UAP, which 
implied transferring the bosses of the Credit lyonnais and the 
Credit national. Another corroboration is the showdown between 
the prime minister's office and the Economics Ministry to find 
Michel Albert's successor. Edmond Alphandery had to throw his 
resignation into the ring to snatch a win for the appointment of 
his protege, Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, who is more friendly 
toward the UDF than the RPR. A true "cultural exception!" 
  Boards of directors thus become "a true admiration society." 
As shown in the case of the Societe Generale, any threat against 
one of the leading beacons of the new capitalism would be 
perceived as a danger by the others. It remains that the 
rigidity of the system is also its weakness. How will it deal 
with quarrels of succession without cracking? 
  Even more serious is the absence of a real counterpower and 
control outside the "club." Jacques Friedmann can assert all he 
wants that cross-shareholding investments do not lessen the 
scope of mutual controls ("We have the interests of our 
companies to defend and accounts to give to our boards of 
directors and to our shareholders as a whole."), there continues 
to be a doubt about the leaders' ability to escape the hold of 
the clan. The public authorities plead in their own defense a 
limited "address book." A few weeks ago, Gerard Longuet was 
acknowledging: "The number of French participants is relatively 
small. They are known. We have Paribas, Suez, the AXA, UAP, GAN 
[National Insurances Group] and AGF for the financiers; a few 
private groups, such as those of Marc Fournier (the Mixed 
Shipping Company), and mutually crisscrossing industries in the 
image of Elf and Renault, in addition to people who get along 
together like Philippe Jaffre, Michel Pebereau, and Louis 
Schweitzer. France is a small country." 
  TO TAME -- But how can we imagine that BNP boss Michel 
Pebereau, as UAP's main shareholder, would question Jacques 
Friedmann, who seats on his board of directors, he too as a main 
shareholder? Boldness is not the first quality of high officials 
who are now business leaders and who built their brilliant 
career primarily by trying not to make mistakes. We can wonder 
about their ability to tackle business and to take industrial 
risks. 
  For them, the transfer to the private sector corresponds to 
the need of taming the market. Therefore, it involves primarily 
showing an acceptable profitability and choosing management over 
offensive strategies. In fact, a falling stock price is the 
single factor of destabilization. Theoretically, the creation at 
a future date of a French-style pension fund could some day give 
small stockholders real power, but it has been postponed until 
fall. 
  Finally, in-breeding carries with it another risk should one 
of these groups, which are the system's key factors, run into 
difficulty. It is easy to imagine that the state could not 
remain indifferent, the Treasury standing as the ultimate 
guarantee of a rigid and closed system. Does it really involve 
giving the private sector a chance?

<F P=106> [Article by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and </F>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel: "Welcome to Our Eastern 
Cousins"] 
  [Text] In the past, some used to say "Germany" when they 
meant West Germany. Many still say "Europe" when they mean West 
Europe. But Europe does not stop at the Oder-Neisse. Who can 
fail to recognise that Warsaw or Riga, Budapest, Prague or 
Ljubljana are European cities? The task of the Nineties, for 
Britain and Germany, is to make a political reality of that 
cultural reality. 
  Had the Iron Curtain not divided Europe after 1945, none of 
the founders of European integration would have ever thought of 
excluding countries such as Czechoslovakia or Poland. We must 
project security and stability from our part of Europe to other 
European countries in the East. Eventually, they should 
participate fully in all European institutions -- in particular 
the European Union [EU] and NATO. 
  At its last summit in January 1994, NATO declared that it 
was 
open to new members. The European Community summit in 
Copenhagen confirmed the prospect of membership for those 
countries which have concluded Europe Agreements. 
  There are three fundamental reasons why we should consider 
enlarging the EU and NATO: security, prosperity and shared 
values. 
  We shall not be secure if uncertainty and anxiety reign just 
beyond our borders. Stability in central Europe enhances our 
own stability. 
  The basis of our prosperity is the open world trading 
system. 
We have now, on our doorstep, dynamic economies with highly 
skilled labour, rich in ideas and full of entrepreneurial 
vigour. The fastest growing stock market in the world last year 
was not in Shanghai or Canton: it was in Warsaw. 
  We and our trading partners to the East are already 
benefiting from this. EC exports to central Europe increased by 
87 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and now stand at around US$11 
billion. The central Europeans themselves sell half of their 
exports in the EC. The Europe Agreements stipulate free trade by 
the end of 1995 -- with a few exceptions such as agriculture. 
  But more remains to be done. Too often the EC reserves its 
greatest trade restrictions for precisely those goods that the 
central Europeans produce most efficiently. 
  We have to face new competition. Closer ties with the 
economies in central Europe will mean more structural adjustment 
for us. But those structural changes will open the way for 
enormous overall increases in wealth -- for us and for our 
partners. 
  Last, but not least, culture. Our Eastern neighbours belong 
to Europe, not just as a matter of geography or economics; there 
is a common culture. We have to increase the exchange of ideas 
-- particularly in the humanities and the social sciences. 
  A sober assessment of our interests shows that they all 
point 
in the direction of enlarging the EU and NATO. That cannot 
happen overnight. Guarantees that exist only on paper do not 
contribute to security. Security guarantees must grow out of a 
sense of shared values, common interests and a common destiny. 
  Enlarging NATO is a decision for the Alliance as a whole-not 
just for Britain and Germany. All its members, above all the 
United States which continues to do so much to maintain European 
security, must give their wholehearted consent. 
  The Western EU is developing its role as the European pillar 
of NATO and as the defence component of the EU. Britain and 
Germany are working together with others to involve the central 
Europeans and the Baltic states in the work of the WEU [Western 
European Union]. 
  New members must be capable of implementing EU law. That 
presupposes a competent administration and a proper system of 
justice. They must be capable of competing in the Single 
Market. On our side, too, there will have to be changes. EU 
institutions and EU policies will have to adapt to a wider 
community -- a community of 20 or more members. We must ensure 
that at every stage a wider community becomes a stronger one. 
Both for the EU and NATO, widening must not mean weakening. 
  Those are goals for the medium-term. In 1994, we must open 
ourselves to our neighbours in as many ways as possible. The 
forthcoming German EU presidency will spare no efforts to draw 
our Eastern neighbours closer. 
  But in all this, the transatlantic relationship remains a 
fixed anchor point for the EU. Without a continuing stake by 
the United States in European affairs, enlargement of the EU and 
NATO cannot succeed. 
  The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe also 
has a vital role. It is the only institution embracing all 53 
European and North American states. Through the CSCE we can 
assure that developments in West and Central Europe are not 
misinterpreted by our Eastern partners. 
  To enlarge the Alliance in a way that made those inside it 
more secure but left those outside feeling threatened would be 
no service to Europe. That means that other countries must be 
convinced that this is a development in which they are not 
ignored. 
  No country is an island, whatever its geography. We have a 
duty to our European neighbours. They had to live under imposed 
isolation from West Europe. They are now returning to freedom 
and to the rule of the law. This is a historic task. Britain 
and Germany have committed themselves to this goal for the rest 
of the century.

  [Text] Brussels, April 25 -- Polish Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk handed over to NATO Deputy Secretary General 
Sergio Balanzino a document including a list of spheres and 
forms of cooperation with NATO proposed by Poland within the 
Partnership for Peace programme, at the NATO Headquarters here 
on Monday [25 April]. 
  The NATO deputy secretary general said he hoped that an 
individual programme of bilateral cooperation would be agreed 
upon by Poland and NATO before the summer holidays in August. 
  Poland is the first partner to present a document including 
details of her plans to develop closer links with NATO. 
  "We have never believed that the Partnership for Peace 
initiative is a race with its winner receiving a prize of NATO 
membership," Kolodziejczyk stressed, adding that Poland treated 
this programme very seriously. 
  "We think that the initiative is giving an opportunity to us 
-- and not only to us -- to construct a new European security, 
and that is why we are aiming at setting up this system as soon 
as possible." 
  Asked about Russia's participation in the programme, 
Kolodziejczyk said it would be great if Russia would join the 
states which wanted to build a secure Europe in this way. 
However, he added one could not accept a situation when a 
partnership gives more privileges to some members. 
  The Polish minister said the priorities proposed by Poland 
included peace missions, humanitarian and rescue actions, 
military manoeuvres, scientific exchange, trainings, and a 
programme of full democratic control over the Armed Forces. 
  Kolodziejczyk also added that of importance were the issues 
designed to settle communications procedures between the Polish 
general staff and NATO Headquarters (Supreme Headquarters Allied 
Powers Europe -- SHAPE) and the headquarters in Brussels. 
  After leaving the NATO Headquarters, Kolodziejczyk left for 
a 
meeting with Supreme Allied Commander Europe -- SACEUR Georg 
Joulwan at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in 
Casteau.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "IMF: Fazio Calls For Budget, </F>
Fiscal Severity"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Washington, April 25 -- Rigorous budget 
policy severity over the medium term along with action on the 
monetary front will be required to "reassure the financial 
markets" and to reach the goals of "lower long-term interest 
rates and opening new expectations of non-inflationary growth," 
said Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio. 
  Addressing the annual spring meeting of the International 
Monetary Fund here he also called for fiscal discipline among 
the industrialized nations and declared, "The markets need 
signals to confirm the fact that the increase in American rates 
will not stop the decline in European rates." 
  "We are called on to act in a non-inflationary way, and not 
only through monetary policy, to bring down the cost of capital 
in real terms," the central banker continued. "Medium-term 
fiscal recovery must, therefore, continue for the objective of 
stimulating and strengthening savings and stabilizing 
expectations." 
  Fazio said the industrialized nations must also pursue "wage 
moderation, which prevents the risk of inflationary pressures." 
  Providing a run-down of developments in basic economic 
policy 
in Italy following the devaluation of the lira, the governor 
touched on wage dynamics brought under control, discipline on 
the monetary and budget fronts and public sector reform, all of 
which have led to "important progress in reducing inflation and 
improving the balance of payments." "This strategy can be 
strengthened and carried further forward in the context of 
recovery in the economic cycle which is now beginning to 
materialize," he added. 
  Citing the figures, Fazio said the balance of current 
accounts in Italy moved from 2.3 percent of GDP in 1992 to a 
surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP the following year. The surplus, 
he said, "should be significantly larger in 1994." 
  On another issue here, Bank of Italy Director General 
Lamberto Dini said increases in rates and instability on 
international bond markets "are not consistent with the 
favorable scenario on the inflation front." 
  At a meeting of the Group of Ten, Dini reviewed recent 
events 
on the bond markets and the highly-speculative hedge funds which 
came to influence the course of bonds and their yields. 
  Earlier, the director general told a press conference that, 
"At the end of 1993, a certain euphoria dominated the market 
because of the expectation of lower short-term interest rates in 
Europe and long-term rates in the United States. Then a series 
of events, beginning with the first small increase in February 
in FED fund rates in the United States, caused a strong shift in 
the expectations of dealers, a change which was perhaps 
excessive compared to the fundamentals of the economies," he 
noted. "In fact, we have witnessed the phenomenon of 
overshooting which caused this rise in long-term rates." 
  A communique issued at the end of the Group of Ten meeting 
said, "Ministers and governments have agreed on the fact that 
despite the presence of sharp price movements in the prices of 
securities, the financial markets have worked well and have 
managed the increase in the volume of transactions without 
systematic problems and tensions."

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/320: "China/European Union </F>
Cooperation: Meeting Between Mrs. Christiane Scrivener and Mr. 
Gu Yongjiang, Chinese Deputy Minister for Trade and Economic 
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Mrs. Scrivener [commissioner for taxation and 
customs affairs] and Mr. Gu Yongjiang held talks [venue not 
specified] on 20 April on the occasion of an official visit by a 
Chinese delegation. China's reintegration into GATT was one of 
the items on the agenda. 
  Mrs. Scrivener recalled that the European Union (EU) has 
always supported this request. "It falls within the scope of a 
deeper integration of China into world trade," she added. It 
logically follows the objectives that were defined in Marrakesh 
during the formal conclusion of the Uruguay Round. 
  Mrs. Scrivener added that China was expected to clearly 
commit itself to meet specific conditions, to adopt a pragmatic 
approach, and to implement provisional stages. 
  The European commissioner stressed "it is necesssary that 
trading partners like China and the European Union clearly show 
their determination to guarantee fair trade, an essential 
condition to give each country a chance to ensure its economic 
development." 
  Mrs. Scrivener welcomed the initial results of the technical 
assistance developed with China in customs matters, and she 
proposed that a joint activity program be set up in customs and 
taxation matters. "Working together to fight evils like 
counterfeiting and fraud will make the economic agents more 
confident." 
  The Chinese deputy minister has agreed in principle to this 
approach. Mrs. Scrivener, who is satisfied with the economic 
reforms initiated by China on the path to a market economy and 
with the reforms carried out in taxation matters (a tax on 
corporate profits as well as a VAT [value-added tax] system have 
been introduced), welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment 
to deal with European companies on an equal basis, as confirmed 
by Gu Yongjiang. 
  "Customs cooperation between the European Union and China 
must be enhanced," Mrs. Scrivener said. "This will help 
guarantee more competitive trade relations between China and the 
European Union." 
  At the end of the talks, Mrs. Scrivener accepted the 
invitation extended by Deputy Minister Gu to visit China in the 
coming months.

Presidency on Behalf of the European Union on the Elections in 
Ukraine"] 
  [Text] The EU [European Union] welcomes the enthusiasm 
shown by the Ukrainian people by participating in large numbers 
at the first parliamentary elections in Ukraine. 
  The EU expresses its satisfaction for a free and fair 
voting, 
as confirmed by the observer's reports at Ukrainian general 
elections which were held on the basis of a multiparty system, 
praising in general the attitude of the electoral staff and the 
serious effort from all sides. 
  The EU hopes that the outcome of the elections will enable 
the country to proceed with the process of political and 
economic reform. Viewing the recent increased tensions in 
Crimea with concern and taking into consideration the outcome of 
the vote held by the Crimean administration, it urges the 
continuation of efforts to find negotiated and legitimate 
solutions to issues at dispute, without resort to confrontation. 
  The EU reaffirming its full support for the territorial 
integrity of a sovereign Ukraine in accordance with the charter 
of the United Nations and with the principles of the CSCE final 
act underlines that provocative actions risk creating 
instability and can be in noone's interest.

<F P=106> [John Ridding report: "Battle Begins for the Other Europe"] </F>
  [Text] Paris -- They met in the Salon de la Paix, in a 
sumptuous Parisian hotel, but they came to do battle. 
  Their enemy is the Europe of Maastricht, and their cause is 
the Europe of Nations, a political movement formed to fight in 
June's European elections. 
  They are a surprising mixture of bedfellows. Sir James 
Goldsmith -- Jimmy to his French friends -- is at the heart of 
the struggle. Having discarded dawn raids for environmental 
concerns, the former international financier is to stand as a 
candidate on the list put forward by L'Autre Europe, a French 
party formed to campaign in the European Parliament elections. 
  Sir James is second on the Other Europe's list for France's 
European polls. Above him is the founder of the party, Mr 
Philippe de Villiers -- a viscount, a member of parliament and 
the suave French champion of the anti-Maastricht cause. Number 
three is Mr Charles de Gaulle, grandson of the general, and an 
existing member of the European Parliament. "My grandfather 
would never have stood for Maastricht," he says. "He would have 
fought to prevent the disappearance of France." 
  Seated around them yesterday were Eurosceptics from 10 
European countries; Mr Bill Cash, the Tory MP, and Lord Stoddart 
the Labour peer rubbed shoulders with Maastricht dissidents of 
the left and right of the political spectrum from Scandinavia, 
Austria, Germany and Spain. 
  To launch their movement the representatives put their name 
to the Declaration of Paris -- a tract condemning what the 
signatories see as a dangerous trend to centralisation. Their 
aim is to infiltrate the European Parliament in Strasbourg, 
undermine the Maastricht Treaty, and prevent the "asphyxiation 
of Europe." 
  "This debate transcends left and right," declares Sir James. 
"It is about the fight against a federal Europe and building a 
proper, democratic Europe. History shows that excesses of the 
centralisation of power unleash a reaction of centrifugal 
forces." 
  But are Sir James and his allies not tilting at windmills? 
Has the principle of subsidiarity not pulled the rug from 
beneath their nationalist feet? 
  "Subsidiarity has been so abused that it has become deeply 
polluted as an ideal. It should not be about determining the 
size and shape of cucumbers," he replies. As for the windmills: 
"Whether it is quixotic or not, I won't change one word of what 
I believe." 
  Despite being dismissed in France by the ruling RPR-UDF 
coalition and the opposition Socialist party, Sir James and Mr 
de Villiers are confident of support. 
  Sir James says an audience of 1,200 showed up at Angers to 
hear the views of L'Autre Europe; 2,000 came to Nantes. 
  "We will win a substantial vote," says Mr de Villiers. How 
substantial, he is reluctant to predict. 
  "It is at the end of the fair that one counts the cowpats," 
he says, citing a rural French proverb.

  [Text] Berlin, April 23 (CTK) -- Czech Deputy Foreign 
Minister today contributed to a two-day international seminar on 
"Germany and Europe" with a lecture called "What We Expect From 
West Europe." 
  Despite forty years of totalitarianism, the Czech lands had 
always been a part of Europe not only geographically but also 
historically and culturally, Vondra said. 
  Vondra said in an interview for CTK that "The countries of 
the European Union (EU) should show the same courage as Germany 
and France did after the Second World War when they set out on 
the road to European integration and cooperation. EU countries 
should rapidly open their markets to us and demolish trade 
barriers so that we may enter the common market before we even 
become members of the EU." 
  He added that Western Europe (WEU) [as received] should 
allow 
the Czech Republic to join a defence community such as the WEU 
before the country became a NATO member. 
  Asked for his assessment of Czech-German relations, Vondra 
said bilateral relations had been good especially in the last 
few months. Progress had been made in completing the 
negotiations on bilateral agreements, which had been bogged down 
for the past two years, concerning the Czech-German border 
regime and refugees. If different opinions appeared in the 
Czech press it was a question of the psychological level -- real 
relations were good, Vondra said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Brussels EUROPE article: "East Europe -- </F>
Steichen Outlines Guidelines for Effective Collaboration in 
Agricultural Sector"] 
  [Text] "The main orientation of future agricultural 
cooperation between the European Union and the countries of 
Central and East Europe must aim to ensure a gradual convergence 
of our policies," European Farm Commissioner Rene Steichen 
stated in an address given last Friday [15 April] at the 
University of Agronomy of Warsaw. According to Mr. Steichen, 
such cooperation -- to be established on bases of reciprocal 
confidence and not antagonism -- should enable setting into 
motion two parallel processes by better using existing 
instruments and improving them if necessary: One in the long 
term which will have to "logically lead to the adherence of 
countries of Central and East Europe to the Union" and the 
other, in the immediate term, which would enable establishing 
"now an atmosphere of trust." He regretted with regard to this 
some of the criticism from the countries of Central and East 
Europe which attribute the difficulties of their farmers to the 
so-called protectionism of the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy]. 
This criticism underestimates in his opinion the extent of the 
difficulties of an internal nature that many of the Central and 
East European producers will encounter in the delicate phase of 
transition from the old system to the new. Regarding the terms 
of cooperation sought, the Commissioner suggested exploring in 
Central and East Europe two major complementary directions: 
  1. A system ensuring the stabilization of agricultural 
prices 
(namely through a mechanism of support of certain primary 
products). Nevertheless, in order to avoid repeating the 
pitfalls of the former CAP, this system will also have to 
encourage producers to sell on the market by calculating the 
support, keeping in mind the interactions between internal 
support and trade. 
  2. Reform of the credit system in order to help farming 
concerns cope with their current financial difficulties, to 
modernize their production apparatus and to improve their 
international competitiveness. In this context, agricultural 
banks should be created (as is already the case in Poland where 
an agri-industrial bank was established) that are able to settle 
the problem of the lack of liquid assets and the nonexistence of 
a land market. For this purpose, the initial financial 
contribution from private investors, local governments, the EBRD 
[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], the World 
Bank and the European Union could be combined. 
  According to Mr. Steichen, the Commission would be prepared 
to make a more general contribution to guidance, education, 
training and assistance, to the establishment of these banks and 
even to examine more direct collaboration. Observing 
nevertheless that "the Community will never be able to absorb by 
itself all the exports from its East European neighbours," the 
Commissioner suggested that the countries of Central and East 
Europe seek in parallel to develop new trading links between 
themselves, including if necessary on the financial level, and 
to restore traditional export currents towards the States of the 
former USSR. Mr. Steichen spoke of certain current concerns in 
the EU's agricultural relations with Central and East European 
countries, suggesting that these be remedied by: 
  (i) Improving the mechanisms in force in the Union for the 
import of red fruit (minimum prices) and cherries (safeguard 
mechanisms), that is to say by rapidly inserting an early alert 
mechanism in the different systems; 
  (ii) encouraging the harmonization of veterinary legislation 
in order to implement as soon as possible common norms and by 
establishing equivalencies (an agreement for this purpose should 
be concluded by the end of the year) which would considerably 
reduce controls.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Troops and Dollars"] </F>
  [Text] The signals are utterly, maybe disastrously, mixed. 
On the one hand -- after last week's meeting of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States -- we see the beginnings of a 
"defensive union" which edges Russia still further from the 
Partnership For Peace that NATO half-heartedly offered. There 
is, here, the beginning of a countervailing alliance which, if 
the documents as duly signed have reality, will one day put 
Russian troops on the borders of Iran, Turkey and Poland. 
Meanwhile (the other hand) we're poised tomorrow for final 
International Monetary Fund approval of a $1.5 billion loan deal 
with Russia -- the breaking of the long log-jam to reform. This 
loan -- tiny though it is -- could pave the way for the next 
($4.1 billion) tranche of the $28 billion announced long ago by 
the Group of Seven -- but never authorised. 
  The Russian economy is still in an apocalyptic condition. 
The monthly rate of inflation has fallen from 22 per cent in 
January to 9 per cent in March as a result of the new-found 
stringency of the central bank, but industrial output fell 24 
per cent in the year to the first quarter of 1994 after a 21 per 
cent contraction in 1992. 
  These figures may exaggerate the scale of decline. Some of 
the lost output may have been worthless and the output of the 
fledgling private sector may have been underestimated; but, 
after all the excuses, it still leaves a huge hole at the centre 
of the economy. The stoicism of the Russian people may be 
legendary, but it is not inexhaustible. Economic erosion of 
this order can't go on for much longer without extremely serious 
social consequences. 
  Such statistics paint a bleak backdrop to this week's annual 
meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
[EBRD] in St Petersburg. The EBRD, set up to help reconstruct 
East Europe, has been busily reconstructing itself after the 
financial excesses of Jacques Attali. Yet, even now, it has yet 
to make a serious impact on the spiralling problems of Russia, 
let alone the rest of East Europe. 
  That is a job which, ultimately, can only be done by Russia. 
But the daunting task of economic stabilisation and market 
reform can, and must, be assisted by the world's richer nations. 
It is no use telling Russia that they will get Western billions 
after they have reformed -- for the simple reason they need help 
in order to put their house in order. A currency stabilisation 
plan of the kind that gave Poland a kick-start could have 
short-circuited the vicious devaluation-led spiral of inflation 
which is still a constant threat to the economy. It remains to 
be seen whether the new Russian parliament approves the austere 
budget proposals. If it doesn't, it will clearly make it more 
difficult for the IMF to speed up the aid programme. That said, 
the Russian government which ditched the Gaydar reformists has 
gone much further than anyone could have hoped at the time in 
accepting the economic strait-jacket which the IMF, sadly, 
expects supplicants to wear. If this opportunity is missed, the 
consequences for Russia could be very serious indeed -- which is 
precisely where the revival of some of the old Soviet military 
reach enters the equation. There are some who already see 
historic folly in the West's bolstering of a potential enemy. 
And the first flexing of those arthritic muscles -- against the 
poisonous background of a rampant Zhirinovskiy -- will 
exacerbate such fears. Mixed signals, and motives. But there is 
still a central equation. A Russia recovering economically will 
be a Russia more at ease with itself and more bound into a world 
whose Partnership For Peace needs to go further. The tracks 
don't yet diverge.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrew Lorenz: "British Jostle for 1bn Pound S </F>
Africa Defence Deals"] 
  [Text] British Aerospace [BAe] and three UK shipbuilders -- 
Swan Hunter, GEC [General Electric Company] and Vosper 
Thornycroft -- are pushing for defence-equipment orders from 
South Africa worth up to 1 billion pounds. Rapid progress in 
negotiations is expected when the United Nations arms embargo 
against South Africa is lifted after this week's elections. 
  BAe has strong prospects of securing the sale of well over 
20 
Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft, ultimately worth more than 500m 
pounds. Any deal could involve initial exports from Britain, 
followed by local manufacture in South Africa. An alternative 
would be for all the manufacturing to be carried out in South 
Africa under licence. BAe and Denel, the South African defence 
manufacturer, are understood to have been in talks for months 
about a Hawk purchase. 
  Swan Hunter, GEC's Yarrow subsidiary in Glasgow and 
Southampton-based Vosper are battling for a near-450m pound 
order for up to six corvettes. Victory for Swan Hunter would 
secure the survival of the Tyneside yard. CMN [Maritime 
Shipping Company], a French shipbuilder, is in negotiations to 
buy Swan. In the past, both Vosper and GEC have expressed an 
interest in the company. 
  South Africa wants the small warships to modernise its navy, 
which has been run down during the years of the embargo under UN 
Resolution 558. The resolution is widely expected to be 
repealed soon atter the elections. The British government has 
cleared the way for both Hawk and corvette deals by inviting 
Denel's Atlas Aviation subsidiary to bid for the 2 billion pound 
contract for a new British army attack helicopter. 
  Atlas is offering its Rooivalk helicopter and has teamed up 
with Marshall Aerospace of Cambridge which would assemble the 
aircraft if it wins the competition. Rival bidders include 
Westland with McDonnell Douglas's Apache, GEC with the Amencan 
Cobra helicopter, and BAe with the Franco-German Eurocopter. 
  The government move emerged in a written parliamentary 
answer 
by Jonathan Aitken, the defence-procurement minister and is 
conditional on the UN arms embargo being lifted. 
  It has given a big fillip to BAe, which has been in contact 
with the South African air force about a possible Hawk sale for 
two years. The Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 models are widely regarded 
as the best trainer-fighters in the world, and would replace 
South Africa's Impala two-seat trainers, which are made by Atlas. 
  The form of a deal, involving substantial local manufacture 
would be similar to a BAe contract with South Korea, agreed two 
years ago and worth about 1.7 billion pounds. Most of the Hawks 
will be built in South Korea after export of an initial tranche 
from Britain. 
  A BAe-Atlas deal could open the way to further Hawk sales in 
southern Africa. Zimbabwe already operates the original Hawk 60 
jet and might want to buy a newer model. 
  John Weston, head of BAe's defence subsidiary, has forecast 
that the company will win orders for up to 400 Hawks worth 7 
billion pounds during this decade. Apart from South Africa and 
long-established prospects in Saudi Arabia and India BAe has 
high hopes of selling to Australia and Singapore. The order 
prospects were revealed last month in a briefing to City 
analysts by Rolls-Royce, whose Adour engine powers the aircraft.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe Is a House Without Windows"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels has caught the British disease: obsessive 
secrecy. Unlike the UK, information still emerges there because 
it is frequently in the self-interest of member states to leak 
their "reasonable" arguments -- and the "unreasonable" positions 
of their opponents. But leaks come with much spin and heavy 
bias. What is missing is a public right to know -- which would 
provide access to briefing documents so that there could be 
unbiased accounts of what is happening. A new era of openness 
was supposed to have begun in January. Both the Maastricht and 
Copenhagen summits embraced the idea of freedom of information. 
Hail transparency! The Brussels bureaucracy obliged with codes 
of conduct, rules and regulations supposed to open the European 
Union's windows. Out went the old approach: everything is 
secret unless a decision is taken to make it available. In came 
the new: everything is accessible, unless there are good 
reasons to withhold it. Yet, at its first test, the new system 
has collapsed. A request from our European Affairs Editor in 
Brussels for a series of background documents on different 
decisions has ended in farce. 
  A few documents were initially released. We obtained the 
documents behind Britain's controversial opt-out from the 
European directive to protect child workers, but were denied all 
papers concerning the Justice Council. Yet the grounds on which 
access was denied -- that the papers included official 
deliberations -- applied equally to the papers released. When 
this contradiction was pointed out, Brussels produced a response 
worthy of Sir Humphrey: the justice division (which withheld 
its documents) was right, the social affairs department (which 
released its documents) was wrong. It is not just the windows 
which Brussels wants closed, but the shutters as well. 
  The root of the problem is not difficult to identify: the 
vagueness of the European Union's commitment. The Maastricht 
Declaration on the right of access to information could not have 
been clearer: "Transparency strengthens the democratic nature 
of the institutions." The code which followed has a list of 
perfectly respectable exemptions (public security, monetary 
stability, commercial interests), but also a catch-all exemption 
worthy of a totalitarian state: the right to refuse access "in 
order to protect the institution's interest in the 
confidentiality of its proceedings." To their credit, the Dutch 
object to this sweeping clause. The fight is only beginning. 
As the European Ministers themselves declared at Maastricht: 
the right to know is a fundamental way of strengthening public 
confidence in Europe's institutions.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of Transport: </F>
"Major Step Forward in Aviation Security"] 
  [Text] Directions requiring airlines to account for and 
authorise for carriage (known as triple A) of every item of hold 
baggage placed on board an aircraft on international flights 
originating in the United Kingdom have been issued today. 
  Making the announcement during a visit to Manchester 
Airport, 
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, Minister for Aviation said: 
  "Triple A is a major step forward in our aviation security 
programme. The directions will come into force on 1 July this 
year and will give legal effect to a security initiative 
introduced into the National Aviation Security Programme as a 
Recommended Practice in January this year. 
  ``For some time, the Government has been seeking an 
available 
and effective means of identifying and dealing with the `rogue 
bag' that is a bag introduced into the air transport system 
which has no connection with any passenger on a particular 
flight. Triple A is the solution to this problem. 
  ``No-one should have any doubts about this government's 
commitment to aviation security. The Department of Transport's 
nine-fold increase in expenditure on and ten-fold increase in 
staff involved in aviation security over the last five years are 
figures that speak for themselves. It is this commitment which 
has propelled the advances in technology which make it possible 
for me to issue today a Direction which will result in airline 
passengers travelling from the UK enjoying one of the highest 
level of security in the world. 
  ``The work like that done here at Manchester on baggage 
management has helped create the advances in technology which 
enable me to make this announcement today. 
  ``Last year, Manchester Airport took the initiative and 
hosted successful trials which proved the effectiveness of an 
automated baggage management system developed by Ferranti 
Electronics. I would like to commend the airport for its 
foresight in seeking the introduction of a system that will not 
only improve the service airlines and airports are able to offer 
air travellers, but will also have significant benefits for the 
security of civil aviation in this country. 
  ``It is clear that a number of airlines are already meeting 
the requirements of the direction. For others, where large 
investment in equipment may be necessary, there will be an 
agreed and binding phasing-in period. The standard will apply 
to all international flights originating at all airports in the 
United Kingdom and will cover both accompanied and unaccompanied 
hold baggage. The requirements can be met in a number of ways, 
but airlines operating both here and at other UK airports might 
do well to take advantage of Manchester's experience in 
operating an effective automated baggage management system. 
  ``In doing so, they will be certain of complying with our 
new 
security requirements. In addition, they may find that such a 
system will more than pay for itself in commercial terms by 
drastically reducing the amount of misrouted baggage.''

<F P=106> [Report by Alexander Nicoll and Andrew Taylor: "Amec to Set </F>
Up Joint Venture With China"] 
  [Text] Amec, the UK construction group, has agreed to set 
up a joint venture which will build petro-chemical, oil and gas 
production facilities in China. 
  The company's process engineering subsidiary yesterday 
signed 
an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Chinese Offshore 
Industrial Corporation [COIC], a state-owned shipbuilding group. 
The two companies are finalising joint-venture terms. 
  The agreement covers construction of on-shore petro-chemical 
plants as well as off-shore oil and gas production facilities 
for use in China. 
  The deal will also enable the joint venture to build 
advanced 
deep-water floating production vessels in China for sale 
worldwide. 
  Amec will contribute half the venture's costs. In return for 
enhancing its strategic position in the Chinese market, Amec 
will transfer technology for management of projects and 
engineering design. 
  Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said: "Although technology 
transfer was an issue, it was clear than many key skills and 
abilities already exist in our partner's organisation." 
  The venture will develop a joint facility at Huang Pu 
shipyard in Guangzhou province in southern China, capable of 
building modules of up to 5,000 tonnes each. COIC also has the 
ability to build large floating production platforms at a 
300,000-tonne dry dock in north-east China. 
  Amec is already building accommodation modules in 
partnerships with COIC for Phillips Petroleum platforms in the 
South China Sea. 
  Amec is one of Britain's biggest manufacturers and service 
providers for the UK oil and gas industries. Demand for North 
Sea off-shore platforms for has fallen sharply in the past 18 
months. Amec has been seeking to use its technology to expand 
abroad.

<F P=106> [David Marsh article: "Final March of the Old Guard"] </F>
  [Text] Following the revolutions in the East, Europe is 
now coping with upheavals in the West. Five years after the 
surge of Central and East European discontent that led to the 
fall of the Berlin Wall, the ground is shifting under West 
Europe's political leadership. 
  Four weeks after Italy's general election, and with the 
countdown under way to polls in the Netherlands on May 3 and for 
the European Parliament on June 9 and 12, the continent is in 
the midst of a period of intense electioneering. 
  Coming political contests also include Germany's general 
election in October and the presidential tussle in France in May 
1995. By summer next year, most of the leaders who launched a 
dynamic phase of European integration leading to agreement on 
the Maastricht Treaty are likely to have left office. 
  The Maastricht summit in December 1991 represented a high 
point both in enthusiasm for European Union [EU] and for the 
careers of a remarkably long-lived set of European leaders. Of 
the 13 main participants at Maastricht, 11 had been in office 
(some for more than one spell) for six years or more. Since 
then, their political fortunes, like the European economy, have 
turned down. Five of the 13 have left office. At least three 
more will go over the next year. Of the 24 European Union 
finance and foreign ministers who signed the treaty in February 
1992, only seven remain. 
  The new generation must manage a difficult transition. 
Europe's challenges include: 
  1. Handling the slow recovery from recession, in one of the 
most difficult periods for the European economy since the 1930s 
depression; 
  2. Finding a common foreign and security policy to counter 
instability in former Yugoslavia, the ex-Soviet Union and 
northern Africa; 
  3. Holding the 1996 conference to renew the EU's structure 
and preparing for enlargement to East Europe after the planned 
1995 accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden; 
  4. Rediscovering currency stability following the exchange 
rate mechanism's collapse in 1993 and doubts over the Maastricht 
goal of economic and monetary union (Emu) by 1997-99; 
  5. And re-establishing fiscal control after a rise in 
government borrowing to well above Maastricht Emu targets. 
  The Maastricht Treaty has become law, but it looks out of 
kilter with public opinion. The latest opinion surveys in 
Brussels show only 39 per cent of EU voters support the treaty, 
with 22 per cent against it and 39 per cent undecided. 
  Most governments expect a large protest vote in the European 
elections. The treaty gives the parliament greater powers. Yet 
an increased number of anti-Maastricht MEPs [Members of the 
European Parliament] is likely to enter the Strasbourg chamber. 
  "The elections are taking place at the worst possible 
juncture -- a time of malaise and disdain," says Mr Michael 
Sturmer, director of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, a 
German Government policy thinktank. "All governments have 
failed to explain to their populations why Europe is good for 
them." 
  Political and economic strains have undermined earlier 
assumptions about European integration. No government at 
present wants to press for initiatives ahead of the 1996 
Maastricht review conference. This includes reconstructing the 
ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of 
the Danish national bank, and Europe's longest-serving central 
bank chief, says last summer's break-up of the narrow-margin ERM 
has led to a "vacuum" in Emu planning. "This setback has 
paralysed the political process." 
  The changes in Italy, a traditional supporter of European 
Union, are particularly striking. The new government to be 
formed soon, probably under Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is likely to 
be more inward-looking than administrations run by the 
now-eclipsed Christian Democrats over the last 40 years. 
  Most EU members' policies are increasingly focused on 
national interests. This is underlined by France's support for 
its farmers during GATT negotiations, the row between Greece and 
the EU over Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia], and Britain's attempt to maintain its EU voting 
power after next year's enlargement. 
  Priorities seem to be switching in Germany and France, the 
main partners behind European co-operation. Pointing to unrest 
in the former Soviet Union and the Maghreb Mr Richard Portes, 
director of the London-based Centre for Economic Policy 
Research, says: "Germany will be looking more to its interests 
in the East, France to its interests in the south. 
  These are diverging perspectives." 
  A crucial factor behind the Maastricht Treaty was the French 
and German Governments' desire to reinforce the framework of 
integration to tie reunited Germany to West Europe. Leading 
figures in France and Germany admit that the plan to subsume the 
D-Mark into a single European currency was based partly on the 
perceived need to restrain German power. As exPresident Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing recently put it, "We need an organised Europe 
to escape German domination." 
  However, the German electorate's hostility to abandoning the 
D-Mark has added to the difficulties of realising Emu. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he no longer wants "the United 
States of Europe" -- a goal he formerly specifically endorsed. 
  According to Prof Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann head of Germany's 
Allensbach opinion research institute, whose polls are 
influential with Mr Kohl, "There is a great determination in 
Germany not to go towards a federal European state. People want 
to keep national variations unchanged. Before Maastricht, this 
was not an issue." 
  Ms Noelle-Neumann's surveys show German opposition to Emu 
has softened recently because many Germans believe its prospects 
have receded. On the balance between deepening West European 
integration and extending the EU eastwards, Ms Noelle-Neumann 
says Germans have "an unswerving wish" to open Europe to the 
East. "This could create difficulties with France, Italy and 
Spain." 
  In France, business leaders recall Mr Edouard Balladur, the 
prime minister, a possible successor to President Francois 
Mitterrand, previously voiced strong doubts about Emu. "Union or 
not, we have to solve our own problems," says Mr Gerard Worms, 
chairman of France's Suez financial conglomerate. "What will 
happen in 1997 or 1999 is not the most important question." 
  One top French official says wistfully, "If the Soviet Union 
had not fallen, we could have had a triangular relationship 
between West Germany, Britain and France." 
  All hope for the Maastricht blueprint has not been lost. 
Economic recovery will rekindle enthusiasm for West European 
integration, just as it revived after the 1981-82 recession. 
The Union is likely to find a more coherent policy to deal with 
turbulence on its borders. Whatever the German population's 
scepticism, the German Government will not want to escape its 
treaty commitment to Emu. None the less, as Europe's political 
landscape changes, none of these three forecasts can be assured. 
As the 1980's leaders disappear from the stage, the objectives 
they espoused, too, may start to fade from view.

<F P=106> [Article by Philip Stephens: "Pressure Mounts on Major for </F>
Cabinet Shake-Up"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major is being pressed by close colleagues 
to respond to the government's expected heavy defeat in the 
European elections with the most radical cabinet shake-up of his 
premiership. 
  Senior Conservatives believe that a reshuffle which could 
see 
the departure of up to five cabinet and many more junior 
ministers might also mark the return of at least one of the 
political heavyweights of the 1980s. 
  Lord Walker and Lord Howe, two of the longest serving 
ministers in Lady Thatcher's cabinets, are being canvassed as 
potential candidates for the party chairmanship and the 
leadership of the House of Lords. 
  Senior party officials have also floated the idea that the 
employment department and the cabinet post of employment 
secretary could be scrapped to make room for Sir Norman Fowler's 
replacement as chairman. Sir Norman intends to stand down in 
July. Whitehall officials last night strongly rejected the 
idea, but the party insiders said the department's 
responsibilities could be split three ways between trade and 
industry, education and social security. 
  No firm decisions have been taken about the timing of the 
reshuffle beyond a decision by Mr Major to reject the idea of 
announcing the changes before the June 9 European elections. 
  Some insiders believe the shake-up should follow within days 
of the June poll. Others are arguing it should be delayed until 
July to avoid charges that Mr Major had been "panicked" into 
hasty changes. 
  But the intensity of informal discussions in 10 Downing 
Street points to a more radical shake-up than hitherto 
anticipated. There are plans also to strengthen the prime 
minister's team of personal political advisers. Aides want Mr 
Major to replace Mr Graham Bright, his parliamentary private 
secretary, with a much more powerful political figure. 
  Mr Major is being warned the reshuffle will be crucial to 
maintaining his authority during the expected onslaught on his 
leadership after the June poll. Friends of Mr Michael Heseltine 
and Mr Kenneth Clarke have been joined recently by supporters of 
Mr Michael Portillo in informal assessments of their chances in 
any leadership contest. 
  Four middle-ranking ministers have emerged at the top of Mr 
Major's list for the cabinet: Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial 
secretary to the Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, 
Mr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, and Mr David Davis, 
public services minister. 
  With a clear-out of many middle and junior-ranking 
ministers, 
that would allow Mr Major to make promotions from the restless 
Tory backbenches. 
  Likely high-level casualties are Mr Peter Brooke, heritage 
secretary; Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary; and Mr John 
Patten, education secretary. Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, 
has indicated he might decide to stand down while Mr John 
Gummer, environment secretary, is also seen as vulnerable.

  [Text] Bonn -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has emphatically 
refused to mention a date for the abolition of the solidarity 
surcharge. "I will never again be accused of a tax lie," Kohl 
stressed today on the television program "Let's Get Down to 
Business, Chancellor" of the private television station SAT-1. 
At the congress of the Free Democratic Party of Germany in 
North Rhine-Westphalia during the weekend [23-24 April], party 
leader Klaus Kinkel suggested reconsidering the solidarity 
surcharge, which will be levied as of 1 January 1995 and which 
will be 7.5 percent of the gross salary, after three years. 
  However, Kohl promised to lower taxes "as soon as we will 
have overcome the worst." In any event, he refused to mention a 
date for the abolition of the solidarity surcharge. 
  On the eve of the discussions among the coalition and the 
cabinet on a reduction of the Bundeswehr, Kohl stated that, as 
far as the concept is concerned, there is no difference between 
Kinkel and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic 
Union). The tasks of the Bundeswehr have changed after the end 
of the Cold War and require a great deal more money. "We must 
manage with the money that we have and set priorities," Kohl 
pointed out. The soldiers will still get what they need. A 
reduction of the German Armed Force from 370,000 to 340,000 men 
is by no means a security problem, the chancellor stressed. 
  Answering questions by citizens at the main square in 
Wernigerode (Saxony-Anhalt) who participated live in the 
program, Kohl was confident concerning the economic development. 
An upswing is in full swing in the east. This year alone, 
about 100,000 new apartments will be built and approximately 
one-third of the roads will be repaired. The number of the 
unemployed is also stagnating. "We are slowly but surely 
overcoming the lowest point," Kohl stated.

  [Text] Munich -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) has called on Russia to make use of 
its opportunities to exert diplomatic influence to achieve a 
solution to the conflict in Bosnia. "It will be necessary for 
the Russians to use and safeguard their influence on the Serbian 
side," Kinkel stated at the sidelines of an economic meeting in 
Munich this evening. At a meeting in Bonn on Thursday [28 
April], he will discuss the situation in Bosnia with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.

  [Text] Darmstadt (DPA) -- The investigations against three 
Hesse companies on suspicion of illegal deliveries for the Iraqi 
nuclear program have been ceased. Upon inquiry, the Darmstadt 
Public Prosecutor's Office announced on Monday [25 April] that 
the suspicion against the companies Du Pont Germany (Bad 
Homburg), Rittal (Herborn), and Balzers (Wiesbaden) has not been 
consolidated. Investigations are now still underway against six 
companies. 
  In 1992, the nine companies from the Rhine-Main area were 
searched by customs and public prosecutor's officials. 
Previously, IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
inspectors had discovered precision machinery, welding 
equipment, furnaces, and special oil in Iraq, the labels of 
which permitted the conclusion that they came from Germany. The 
equipment was obviously intended for the construction of a gas 
ultracentrifugue, which is needed for enriching weapons-grade 
uranium. In the cases that have been concluded so far, 
investigations showed, however, that the equipment was either 
not subject to a special permit or did not come from Germany.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will 
visit Stuttgart on 2 May (Monday) at the invitation of Edzard 
Reuter, chairman of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz AG. 
According to an announcement made by the corporation on Friday 
[22 April], talks with the board of directors are scheduled. 
The Baden-Wuerttemberg land government confirmed that Minister 
President Erwin Teufel (Christian Democratic Union) plans to 
receive the PLO chairman for an exchange of views on the peace 
process in the Middle East. 
  Since Reuter's visit to Israel in September 1992, 
Daimler-Benz has been intensively working on expanding economic 
relations with the entire Middle East region. At the beginning 
of the year Daimler opened a representation in Tel Aviv and a 
liaison office in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

aid agreement with financial promises of up to 50 million German 
marks was signed in Bonn by FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel

contacts with business representatives in Germany. Aranibar is 
in Germany for a three-day visit. On Monday he was also the 
guest of the Ibero America Association and of the 
Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, which is affiliated to the Social

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Late Thursday evening [21 April] all 
parties in the Bundestg approved the international agreement on 
the control and destruction of chemical weapons at the first 
reading. Helmut Schaefer (Free Democratic Party of Germany), 
state minister in the Foreign Ministry, stressed the importance 
of fastest possible ratification, since the agreement can come 
into force on 1 January 1995 only if at least 65 states have 
deposited the documents of ratification by summer this year. 
  The Bundestag paid particular tribute to the work of the 
German diplomats, who had essentially contributed to the 
conclusion of the agreement in the Geneva Disarmament Committee. 
Olaf Feldman (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and Gernot 
Erler (Social Democratic Party of Germany) stressed the clause 
that permits international, unannounced controls also in 
civilian, private chemical companies, a clause that is unique 
and considered sensational. 
  So far, only the United States and Russia have admitted to 
possessing chemical weapons. The destruction of the enormous 
stockpiles will require at least $20 billion, according to 
estimates. Citing U.S. documents, Erler mentioned the following 
countries which are likely to have chemical weapons: South 
Africa, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Israel, 
China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, South Korea, Thailand, and 
Indonesia. The FRG will contribute 235 million German marks per 
year as of 1995 to the implementation of the agreement. 
  In the debate the Bundestag also adopted the law on 
establishing CSCE arbitration courts, which is based on the 
principles of international law but cannot impose any binding 
ruling for quarreling parties.

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 23 -- The defense of Italian farm 
products will be one of the battle cries of Forza Italia during 
the campaign for European [Parliament--EP] elections in June. 
Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi and his aides discussed 
the matter at a meeting today and next week will also draft 
administrative matters. 
  The protection of Italian farm products both at home and on 
European markets means defending job levels in Italy, according 
to Forza Italia spokesman Antonio Tajani. He claimed that 
production in this important sector of the economy has been 
buffeted, above all, by an invasion of South American farm 
products.

<F P=106> [Interview with Giorgio La Malfa by G.F.B. in Rome; date not </F>
given: "La Malfa: With Mariotto and Amato We Will Stay in the 
Center"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Giorgio La Malfa, what 
is your position vis-a-vis the Berlusconi government? 
  [La Malfa] It is very simple: We are in the opposition. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] However, the Segni Pact, which 
includes 
yourself along with Zanone and Amato, has the Michelini and 
Tremonti lines, which maintain the need for cooperation. 
  [La Malfa] During the election campaign, we maintained that 
the two groupings on the Right and Left are full of 
contradictions because of the contrasts between the various 
components of the two poles. However, the Right won the 
elections, and therefore the government, even though I am 
convinced that they will not manage to govern. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So, there will be collaboration with 
the Berlusconi government? 
  [La Malfa] Neither Segni, nor Amato, nor myself have any 
intention of changing our minds. We are neither on the Right 
nor on the Left. We are waiting and watching. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] However, being at the center, with the 
notorious Mattarella law [on election reform], there is the risk 
of disappearing. 
  [La Malfa] I understand someone being concerned about the 
lack of government posts and wanting to go with the majority. 
We have to wait for public opinion -- which voted for the Right 
-- to change its mind. If the Right shows that it knows how to 
govern, there is always time to change one's mind. If, on the 
other hand, it does not manage to do so successfully, as we feel 
will be the case, public opinion will grow weary and will turn 
back toward the center, which is governed by us. 
  [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] You wish. Do Segni, Amato, and Zanone 
share this view? 
  [La Malfa] It looks to me like they are thinking along the 
same lines, and that it could end up that none collaborate with 
any forces of the Right. We cannot work together with a 
government that includes fascists in its ranks, a Berlusconi 
with the open problem of the monopoly on private TV, and a 
League that has yet to make it clear what sort of federalism it 
wants to impose on the country. Therefore, in the confidence 
vote, as things stand, we will have to vote against. Our dream 
is to found a liberal democratic party capable of bringing 
together all the nondenominationalist, socialist and Catholic 
forces to the right of the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] 
and to the left of the ground currently held by the government. 
  [IL CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Do Segni and Amato agree? 
  [La Malfa] Amato is very close to our way of thinking, while 
Segni shares my position although he is more pessimistic about 
the future evolution of the PDS.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Comit Board Named; Siglienti Not on </F>
It"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Milan, April 23 -- Shareholders of IRI's 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] privatised Banca 
Commerciale Italiana (Comit), meeting for the first time here 
today, approved a new expanded board of 14 members largely 
proposed by managing director Luigi Fausti, in which outgoing 
chairman Sergio Siglienti was notable by his absence. 
  The new board is: Lionello Adler, Giancarlo Cerutti, Giacomo 
D'Ali' Staiti, Diego Della Valle, Michel Francois Poncet, Albert 
Frere, Gianfranco Gutty, Giuseppe Lucchini, Klaus Peschek, Axel 
Von Rudorffer, Vincenzo Sozzani, Giuseppe Stefanel, Enrico 
Beneduce, and Fausti. The board is expected to meet on Tuesday 
[26 April] to appoint executives and confer powers. 
  Only two of the directors are re-appointments: Fausti and 
Poncet, the representative of the big Milan-based bank's 
historic and now major stockholder, Paribas. Beneduce, proposed 
by Fausti and Siglienti, was promoted from central director. 
  Fausti said the predominance of new entries on the board, 
representing some of the cream of European banking, was due to 
the fact that "we will have to knock on their doors for the 
money needed to make the bank grow" in a capital increase that 
had already been aired by Siglienti. 
  The appointment of Albert Frere, chairman and CEO of the 
Groupe Bruxelles-Lambert, was a surprise to some. Those of 
Poncet, Peschek (from Austria's Creditanstalt) and Von Rudorffer 
(Commerzbank of Germany) were less so. Most observers had also 
expected the entry of D'Ali' Staiti, a Comit partner in the Bank 
of Sicily. Hardly surprising, also, was the naming of a 
representative of one of Comit's other historical partners, 
Trieste-based insurance giant Generali, in its managing director 
Gutty. 
  Then there are the industrial partners: Adler for Cartiere 
Burgo, the paper-maker that raked together almost 11 percent of 
Comit shares; Cerutti for engineering group Le Officine 
Meccaniche Giancarlo Cerutti; Della Valle for the footwear group 
of the same name; Giuseppe Lucchini, son of "steel king" Luigi; 
Sozzani for the Pirelli tire and cable group, taking the place 
of Leopoldo Pirelli; and Stefanel of the clothing group. 
  The 15 biggest shareholders present at the meeting (in 
brackets, the ordinary shares held, also as a percentage of 
total capital) were: Paribas Europe (30.9 million, 2.97 
percent), Commerzbank AG (26.99 million, 2.59 percent), 
Frere-Bourgeois SA (20 million, 1.92 percent), Assicurazioni 
Generali (19.21 million, 1.84 percent), Creditanstalt (18.11 
million, 1.74), Cartiere Burgo (10.7 million, 1.029), Ema Srl 
(10.56 million, 1.01), Gemina Investments (10.39 million, 1), 
Gefina (10.3 million, 0.99), Muenchener Rueckversicherung (10 
million, 0.96), Lucchini (9.9 million, 0.95), Fondigest Fondo 
Delta (6.39 million, 0.61), Sibad International (6.15 million, 
0.59), and Cofilp Sim (5.93 million, 0.57). 
  Gefina is a company in the Generali group; Ema is rumoured 
to 
be controlled by Diego Della valle; Cofilp is a merchant bank of 
the Banca Popolare Novara group. The referents of 
Frere-Bourgeois, Muenchener and Sibad are unknown. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ex-Secret Service Official Cites </F>
Scalfaro, 100 Others"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 18 -- Former top secret service 
official Maurizio Broccoletti plans to cite over 100 witnesses, 
including former premiers and interior ministers, among them 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, when hearings open against him 
on April 26 on charges of embezzling public funds and criminal 
association. 
  As the top administrative official at Sisde, Italy's 
civilian 
espionage service, 51-year-old Broccoletti, who is going on 
trial with his former boss Riccardo Malpica and five others, 
held the purse-strings and decided what was spent where under 
the interior minister's and the prime minister's guidance. 
  Malpica was arrested on October 29 last year after testimony 
from Broccoletti claiming that interior ministers over the last 
ten years, including Scalfaro during his spell at the ministry 
from 1983-87, should receive the blame for any financial 
misdeeds in secret service funding. 
  The charges claim that Malpica, Broccoletti and others 
stashed away at least 40 million dollars through front companies 
and a travel agency to accounts in Italy and San Marino and 
elsewhere, buying real estate, yachts and other property in 
Italy and South America. Later unconfirmed figures claimed that 
even larger sums may be involved. 
  The investigations into the illicit use of secret funds 
began 
in 1992 and were shelved late that year, according to 
Broccoletti's allegations because a cover-up had been organised 
by Scalfaro and outgoing Interior Minister Nicola Mancino. 
  Broccoletti was finally placed in preventive custody on June 
25 last year, and other top officials were placed in detention 
over the next few weeks. They were all released as the 
investigations continued. Then, at the end of October, 
Broccoletti was called in for further questioning and submitted 
a dossier formulating his charges against his former political 
bosses. 
  The following day, he fled to Montecarlo as the prosecutors 
once again denied his cover-up allegations. He was arrested in 
Montecarlo on November 2 and extradited to Italy on January 5 
and, on January 6, again claimed there had been a meeting 
between Scalfaro, Mancino and others to organise a cover-up, an 
allegation that was once more denied categorically by Scalfaro's 
office. 
  A list of witnesses filed with the court here today 
indicated 
all the prime ministers who served from 1984 to the present day, 
all the interior ministers who served from June 13 1978 to the 
present day, and all the Sisde chiefs from April 27 1984 to the 
present day. 
  Other witnesses on the list include members of the 
judiciary, 
bank officials and executives, and others who had dealings with 
Sisde and its funds. 
  The prime ministers to be cited are, in chronological order, 
Bettino Craxi, Amintore Fanfani, Giovanni Goria, Ciriaco De 
Mita, Giulio Andreotti, Giuliano Amato, and Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi; the interior ministers, Virginio Rognoni, Amintore 
Fanfani, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Antonio Gava, Vincenzo Scotti, 
and Nicola Mancino. 
  According to Broccoletti's lawyers, the prime ministers 
should be called for their role deciding areas of competence as 
to the management of the secret funds and the criteria applied 
for sharing them, deciding on bonus payments and so on. 
  Similar points were made as regards the interior ministers 
and the ex-Sisde chiefs whom Broccoletti wants to see on the 
witness stand.

China"] 
  [Text] Basel, 21 Apr (ATS) -- The Swiss 
chemical-pharmaceutical group Ciba has decided to set up a joint 
venture in China. Two months after it established a branch in 
that country, Ciba's Plants Protection Division signed an 
agreement with the Qingdao Pesticides Factory in Qingdao on 
Thursday [21 April], the Basel-based chemical group said. The 
new company will produce active substances as well as compounds. 
  The Chinese partner will hold 45 percent of the assets, the 
other 55 percent being the property of Ciba, which also will 
designate the director. The new company, which will start its 
activities in 1996 once its production units have been 
completed, will employ around 180 people.

  [Text] Copenhagen, April 25 -- Poland believes it will 
become an European Union (EU) member before the year 2000, 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said in Copenhagen Monday 
[25 April], during his one-day working visit to Denmark. 
  He told a press conference that Poland has made a 
significant 
progress in meeting European standards in the field of 
democracy, observance of human rights and economic growth. 
  While in Copenhagen, Olechowski met with his Danish 
counterpart Niels Helveg Petersen to discuss current situation 
in Europe and the priorities of Poland's foreign policy in the 
context of Poland's aspirations to join the EU and NATO. 
  The Danish side expressed the conviction that Poland should 
be granted full membership of the EU and that the application 
for EU membership was a right, well-timed step. 
  Petersen also stressed that Denmark was ready to cooperate 
with Poland within the framework of the Partnership for Peace 
programme. 
  Later in the day Olechowski was received by Denmark's Prime 
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen for talks on opportunities for 
cooperation in the Council of the Baltic Sea states. 
  Polish foreign minister discussed possibilities of 
broadening 
Polish-Danish economic cooperation with Minister for Economics 
Marianne Jelved and Minister for Business Affairs Mimi Jakobsen. 
He also met with Peter Duetoft, the head of the parliamentary 
foreign affairs committee.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN peace </F>
mediator in the former Yugoslavia by unattribted correspondent, 
in Moscow; no date given] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Concerted action by the United States, 
the EU [European Union], Russia, and the United Nations seems to 
be the only viable way of creating peace in war-torn Bosnia, the 
UN peace mediator for the former Yugoslavia, Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, said. The last few days Stoltenberg has been in 
Moscow in an attempt to to put together an international 
coalition which can bring an end to the long civil war. 
  In an interview with AFTENPOSTEN Stoltenberg said that there 
is only one word which can describe what has happened in 
Gorazde: madness. The atrocities make it clear to the whole of 
the international community that there is not a single day to be 
lost in the attempts to reach a peaceful solution. "For every 
day that the war goes on, lives are being lost. At the same 
time the involvement on behalf of and the desire for peace is 
greater than it has been for a long time. This is a source of 
optimism in the midst of the terrible reports from Gorazde," the 
Norwegian peace mediator said. 
  Stoltenberg said that he is very happy about the last few 
days' initiatives from both the United States and Russia. ``For 
the first time in a long time we have real hope that the four 
international actors -- that is, the United States, the European 
Union, Russia, and the United Nations -- can arrive at a joint 
position. If the international community confronts the sides in 
Bosnia with a united approach and gives them a clear choice 
between war and peace, there will be a realistic hope that they 
will choose peace. 
  ``As long as the approaches of the United States, Russia, 
and 
the EU have remained so divergent, the sides in the civil war 
have naturally enough each tried to play on their own 
superpower,'' Stoltenberg continued. ``The United States has 
been linked to the Muslims, the Russians to the Serbs, and the 
Germans to the Croats. Each of the sides has believed that it 
could win more by betting on `its' superpower than by seeking 
peace. This has done nothing to promote peace.'' 
  If developments over the next few days go as people hope, 
representatives of the superpowers and the UN will hopefully 
soon come together for a joint conference on Bosnia. It is also 
perhaps possible to hope for a summit between Boris Yeltsin, 
Bill Clinton, European leaders, and the UN secretary general. 
More than one meeting will be needed to sketch a final peace 
treaty for Bosnia. But if the will is there among the 
international actors, a proposal for a peace agreement ought not 
to be so far away, the Norwegian mediator said. 
  "I think that there are a couple of things of which people 
should be fully aware in the future: First the fact that 
anything is better than continued war. It goes without saying 
that we prefer a just peace agreement under which each ethnic 
group in Bosnia is given the land areas which are their due. 
But we may have to settle for less. If in the next few weeks 
it proves impossible to achieve anything other than a cease-fire 
-- that is, a Cyprus solution where the sides are left standing 
where they are now -- the Muslims will remain the losing side. 
But this is greatly preferable to new victims and new 
massacres," Stoltenberg said. 
  The second point he wanted to make was a warning against 
believing that air strikes against Serb positions is an 
abracadabra solution which can bring peace in Bosnia closer. 
"The EU's peace mediator, Lord Owen, and I have continually 
backed the possibility of the UN being able to give orders for 
air strikes against one or more sides in the conflict. But such 
attacks are not without their problems. You have to be aware 
that the Bosnian Serbs have very good antiaircraft defenses. If 
more NATO aircraft take to the air over Bosnia, we have to face 
the fact that some of them will be shot down," Stoltenberg 
stressed.

  [Excerpts] Regarding Bosnia, on the diplomatic level a 
meeting is taking place right now in London. [passage omitted] 
The American and British representatives said the Serbs should 
give back part of the occupied territories. As for France, the 
efforts of the alliance might be salutary and make us forget 
last week's errors of judgement: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] A mistake was made in Gorazde. The 
operation launched by the Serbs was underrated -- it was an 
operation of aggression -- while all the conditions were met for 
us to strike quickly and hard. The reaction came late and in 
small doses. So it is necessary to draw lessons from this for 
the future. By Wednesday [27 April], the Serbs must withdraw by 
20 km in Gorazde. We shall be extremely vigilant. This also 
means that should there be the smallest attack on the other safe 
areas, what tragically took place in Gorazde must not be 
repeated; that is, we must not procrastinate, we must react 
quickly and resolutely. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vienna, April 25 KYODO -- North Korea has conveyed 
its desire to have International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspectors monitor the refueling of its main nuclear reactor at 
the end of this month, an IAEA source said Monday [25 April]. 
  The source said the IAEA has accepted Pyongyang's proposal 
and plans to send an advance party to North Korea as early as 
Thursday to check and remove security seals on the experimental 
reactor. He said their visas have already been prepared. 
  But the IAEA needs to further sound out North Korea on the 
mission, the source said, noting Pyongyang has yet to reply to 
the Agency's inquiries. 
  He said that before sending a full team, the U.N. nuclear 
watchdog wants to know whether the offer to allow observation of 
the unloading of spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear 
facility is merely that, or whether North Korea will also allow 
collection of fuel samples to take place. 
  IAEA spokesman David Kyd told reporters Sunday the Agency is 
"not sending a team until we have clarification." 
  The Agency wants to inspect the spent fuel core of the 
Yongbyon reactor to see if any nuclear material has been 
diverted for possible use in a covert nuclear weapons 
development program. 
  Sampling can determine if the spent fuel had been in the 
Yongbyon reactor since it went on line in 1986, or if the fuel 
had been secretly changed. 
  The reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989, three years 
before the IAEA made its first nuclear inspection in North Korea. 
  The IAEA source said North Korea has not responded to a 
separate agency request that it also be allowed to inspect a 
radiochemical laboratory placed off limits to inspectors in a 
visit last month.

<F P=106> [APA report: "Chernobyl: IAEA Report"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna (APA) -- Exactly eight years after the 
"maximum credible accident" in the Ukrainian nuclear power plant 
of Chernobyl, the melting of the core, and the contamination of 
half of Europe by radioactive substances, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna is publishing the findings 
of eight experts who examined the state of the nuclear power 
plant. Partly alarming facts that caused the IAEA to call for 
its closure were shown. Ukraine will continue its operation. 
  In their report, the IAEA experts state that the probability 
that the nuclear power plant will break down has been reduced; 
at the same time, however, they expressed concerns in the event 
that the reactor is operated outside normal conditions as a 
result of wrong handling. 
  In the opinion of the IAEA, the training and safety concepts 
of the radiation protection staff should remain a subject of 
criticism. The computer program by which operations are 
controlled has been improved, but the hardware restricts the 
possibilities. 
  Further shortcomings that the IAEA ascertained are the 
absence of a second shutdown system and an emergency control 
room for blocks I and II. The three main steam tubes run above 
the only control room.

  [Text] Geneva, April 25 KYODO -- GATT chief Peter 
Sutherland, the most likely candidate for the first head of the 
proposed more powerful world trade body, said Monday [25 April] 
he wants to step down, several diplomatic sources said. 
  Sutherland revealed his intention at an informal meeting of 
the heads of delegations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), citing "personal" matters as the reason for his 
possible resignation. 
  The GATT director general, however, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
that he will not officially express his desire to resign soon. 
  "I cannot say anything now," he said. 
  Sutherland succeeded his predecessor Arthur Dunkel in July 
last year and helped lead the Uruguay Round of global trade 
talks to a successful conclusion last December. His term will 
continue until the end of June next year. 
  There have been talks in the last few months that Sutherland 
may leave GATT halfway through his term to land positions at 
bigger international bodies such as the European Union. 
  An Asian diplomatic source said Sutherland said he wants to 
quit after the preparatory work for the World Trade Organization 
[WTO], scheduled to be formed on January 1 next year to replace 
GATT, is completed. 
  Analysts said Sutherland's remarks will soon prompt 
countries 
planning to participate in the WTO to search for other 
candidates for the chief of the new trade body.

<F P=106> [Eva Bach-Koenig report on UN drug conference which took </F>
place in Vienna "this week"; statements of participants in 
English with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Bach-Koenig] Fifty percent of all crimes are 
drug-related. At a conference in Vienna, representatives from 
53 countries discussed new strategies in the fight against drugs 
this week. Whereas some countries consider the legalization of 
drugs the only solution, the South Asian countries are adopting 
increasingly tough measures. Japan again executed a drug 
smuggler after three years. In Taiwan and Singapore, more drug 
dealers were executed this year than in the whole of last year. 
In China, a total of 1,400 executions took place last year. 
In Singapore, the possession of 15 grams of heroin is 
forbidden on the penalty of death. Portugal is an example of a 
more liberal policy. As Father (Feydor Pinto) stated at the UN 
drug conference, Portugal practically does not punish drug 
consumers. Their rehabilitation should be facilitated in this 
way. In Austria, there are also considerations concerning the 
legalization of so-called soft drugs, including cannabis 
products like hashish. However, this soft attitude is the 
reason for the adoption of tighter laws by Asian politicians, 
the president of the International Drug Control Council, (Hamid 
Godze), claims. 
  [Godze] Legalization only makes matters worse. I do not 
believe that there is any bad intention behind the legalization 
of drugs. It is only a sign of frustration. Legalization is 
certainly not the right path toward a solution of the problem. 
In fact, we are facing numerous setbacks in the fight against 
the abuse of drugs, but we also achieve successes. We must not 
give up hope. 
  [Bach-Koenig] However, the tough position does not seem to 
be particularly successful either. As the Iranian 
representative (Golam Hosseyn Sadegigarache) pointed out, the 
antidrug campaign has developed into an outright war. The drug 
smugglers are being fought by the military in Iran. For this 
reason, the drug smugglers possess ultramodern military 
equipment. 
  Russia and Ukraine do not believe that they are in a 
position 
to get the smuggling of drugs from Iran, Afghanistan, and the 
Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia under control. Russia 
estimates the turnover of the drug dealers in its country at 
approximately $150 million. The Russian representative stated, 
referring to the worldwide sale of drugs: 
  [Unidentified Russian representative] This is a lot. Not 
millions and not hundreds of millions, but billions of dollars 
are involved in drug trafficking, in illegal deals. This is 
probably the largest or second-largest turnover worldwide. The 
profit of the dealers is enormous. This makes them so powerful. 
Thus, the countries must closely cooperate in the fight against 
drug-related crime. Drugs are no national problem. Every piece 
of money earned by the drug dealers, no matter how small it is, 
makes somebody suffer somewhere. 
  [Bach-Koenig] The drug dealers are estimated to turn over 
$100 billion worldwide every year. With a new computer network, 
the 53 member states of the council want to control the 
international trade -- not only the illegal one -- more 
efficiently. Like other countries, Austria has been urged to 
join the UN convention on curbing the legal trade. This 
convention also contains the ban of 10 legal substances which 
are used to produce drugs, including the chemical orange ketone, 
which is used for the production of cocaine. In Austria, 
Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Ireland, some of 
these substances are used on a large-scale basis by the 
pharmaceutical industry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Industrial Output Rose by 3 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] According to the Austrian Central Statistical 
Office, in February 1994 the index of Austria's industrial 
output (1990 equals 100) rose to 101 points after being adjusted 
in line with work days and went up by 3 percent compared with 
February 1993 and by 7 percent compared with January 1994. 
  In January 1994 (94.5) the index rose by 2.2 percent 
compared 
with January 1993, while it went down by 9.8 percent compared 
with December 1993. Without including the energy sector 
(electricity, gas, and heat supplies as well as other energy 
products) output was 5 percent higher in February than during 
the same month last year. 
  Their increase in output was 7 percent higher than in 
January 
1993 for high-tech products, 2 percent for goods for fixed 
investments, and 1 percent for consumer goods. Output in the 
energy sector declined by 1 percent. 
  At the end of February 1994 orders received in the 17 
industrial sectors included in the study amounted to 176.1 
billion schillings. Compared with January 1993 their value 
increased by 3 percent (foreign orders up 4 percent, domestic 
orders up 3 percent). 
  The highest growth rate -- 43 percent -- was registered in 
the paper industry. The strongest slump -- 17 percent -- was in 
the metal industry. 
  In February 1994 orders received amounted to 47.9 billion 
and 
thus rose nominally by 7 percent compared with February 1993 
(foreign orders up 11 percent, domestic orders up 1 percent).

  [Excerpt] Eighty paracommandos are landing at Melsbroek 
military airport outside Brussels this morning. They left from 
Nairobi in Kenya last night, following the evacuation operation 
of Belgians and other Westerners from Rwanda nearly three weeks 
ago. Several hundreds of Belgian troops are still stationed at 
the military camp at the Nairobi airport. The Defense Ministry 
in Brussels says they will all be repatriated. Earlier it was 
expected that the troops would stay in Nairobi to intervene if 
necessary in Burundi, south of Rwanda where ethnic violence has 
claimed thousands of lives in the past few months. [passage

<F P=106> [Michel Rosten commentary: "NATO: End of Neutrality"] </F>
  [Text] We cannot question the importance of transatlantic 
relations which, for West Europe, must remain an absolute 
priority. We certainly could not accuse NATO, reduced to merely 
carrying out UN orders, of wanting to take all the credit. 
Nevertheless, we still find it impossible to subscribe to the 
new instant-mix policy drawn up by Washington and registered on 
Friday [22 April] at NATO headquarters by the permanent Council 
of Ambassadors which drew up an ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs. 
  It is true that the impact of this strong-arm policy will 
please public opinion which was horrified by the Gorazde 
massacre, but the impartial observer must point out its inherent 
contradictions. The West, which wants to bring the Serbs back 
to the negotiating table, has decided, by unusually twisted 
thinking, that the fastest way to do this is by carrying out 
bombing raids that go beyond simply surgical strikes. The 
troops commanded by General Mladic have clearly demonstrated 
after the initial strikes that they will not hesitate to take 
retaliatory action and, consequently, attack blue helmet 
"hostages." 
  The new strategy currently being implemented risks 
escalating 
a conflict in which the Americans refuse to participate on the 
ground. It has to be one thing or the other: Either Washington 
gives a whole new dimension to the Bosnian conflict and sends in 
the U.S. infantry or the White House administration sticks to a 
stance of cautious reserve to preserve UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] neutrality. There is no getting away from the fact that 
a new NATO ultimatum cannot be compared with that issued on 9 
February aimed at lifting the siege of Sarajevo. That one was 
directed at the irregular Serbian troops and Bosnian Government 
forces.... 
  Things have since changed. The whole concept of the 
neutrality of the blue helmets is collapsing. While it is 
acceptable in the name of human rights to impose an 
interventionist force on a country in the throes of civil war, 
is it really justified for NATO to take the side of one of the 
belligerents simply because it is the weaker? Moreover, insofar 
as it does take this decision -- without actually entering the 
war itself to assist "its" blue helmets -- will it not merely 
have accepted the responsibility for prolonging the war?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Van Rooy: `Be Careful With Defensive </F>
Trade Rules'"] 
  [Text] "When implementing the GATT/Uruguay Round, we must 
take care not to liberalize trade on the one hand, while on the 
other hand nullifying this effect by enacting new defensive 
trade rules in the area of antidumping and introducing 
protective measures." This warning was made by Economic Affairs 
State Secretary Van Rooy at the ABN/AMRO conference, "Why 
America Now," held in Amsterdam on 7 April. 
  Van Rooy talked about 20 countries which are busy with 
similar plans, and she pointed in particular to the United 
States: "As regards the implementation of the GATT/Uruguay 
Round agreements, the Netherlands will very carefully supervise 
the adaptation of U.S. antidumping legislation. The current 
practice is that complaints by U.S. companies are honored in 
almost all cases by the Department of Commerce. 
  That gives some food for thought. The United States is 
calling for free trade, but there are clear indications that it 
is protecting its own market for certain sensitive products by 
means of antidumping and antisubsidy legislation." According to 
Van Rooy, the United States, as well as the European Union, must 
not give the wrong impression, since that could end up having a 
boomerang effect on their own exports if other countries react 
with their own antidumping rules. 
<H5>  Increasingly Better </H5>
  According to Van Rooy, Netherlands companies are doing 
increasingly better on the North American market. Netherlands 
exports in 1992 totalled 11.5 billion guilders: Around 10 
billion guilders went to the United States; around 900 million 
to Canada; and around 565 million to Mexico. Exports to Mexico, 
in particular, rose sharply and, according to the most recent 
CPB [Central Planning Bureau] estimate, Netherlands exports to 
the United States rose by 25 percent (in value) in 1993. 
  The state secretary expects that Netherlands exports will be 
able to grow further with the implementation of the NAFTA free 
trade agreement and the GATT agreement. 
  Here, she sees opportunities in particular for products such 
as steel, paper, medical equipment, chemicals, pharmaceutical 
products, foodstuffs, (agricultural) machinery, and supply 
industries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Many Voters Believe the Netherlands </F>
Is Saturated"] 
  [Excerpt] Rotterdam, 23 Apr -- The Netherlands is full. 
This topic is dominating the thoughts of Netherlands voters. 
There is no more room for asylum-seekers. Hardly any racist 
arguments are being advanced, mainly economic ones. 
  That is the most significant opinion expressed to 30 
reporters from NRC HANDELSBLAD during approximately 500 
interviews conducted with voters in the Netherlands last Monday 
[17 April]. Few of those interviewed professed to disliking 
foreigners. Most interviewees saw a direct link between cuts, 
rising unemployment, lower benefit payments, the shortage of 
housing, and the "foreigners," who are supposedly to blame. 
  In order to go further than the meager opinion polls, last 
Monday the Central Bureau for Statistics visited 30 selected 
neighborhoods which together accurately reflect the Netherlands 
as a whole. In all, 527 people were interviewed about their 
voting behavior and the arguments behind it, about the country's 
main problems in their eyes and what "politicians" are doing 
about them. 
  Of all those interviewed, 35 percent spontaneously cited 
"foreigners" as the country's most serious problem. 
"Unemployment" and the Old Age Pensions Law [AOW] followed a 
considerable distance behind, each of these two topics being 
mentioned by approximately 15 percent. The planned cuts on old 
age pensions and other benefits for the elderly have stirred up 
a lot of bad blood. The voters regard "crime" as being less 
important than many politicians believe: Only 10 percent 
spontaneously ranked this topic among the important issues. 
Issues such as "social security," "discrimination," and "the 
environment" remained some way behind, being mentioned by 
between 5 and 10 percent of those interviewed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher today warned Bosnian Serb forces that 
they needed to do more to avoid the risk of NATO air attacks. 
  After brief talks at the Foreign Office in London, the two 
men underlined the need for total compliance with a NATO 
ultimatum, which demands that Serbs have until 0001 GMT tomorrow 
to withdraw heavy weaponry at least 12 miles (20 kms) from the 
ravaged Bosnian Muslim enclave or face air strikes. 
  As the clock ticked towards the deadline, Mr Christopher 
told 
reporters: "The information I have this morning is that the 
Serbs have moved a number of heavy weapons outside the 20 km 
zone, but there are a number still there. It is clear that 
today will be an important day to see if they really will comply 
with requirements." 
  Mr Christopher said: "There's been some movement but not 
enough yet." 
  Foreign Secretary Mr Hurd said it was a "critical period," 
and reiterated his hope that there would be no need for air 
strikes. 
  "There should be no difficulty in working out in the course 
of tomorrow whether there is a need for air strikes or not. I 
hope there won't be. I hope the Serbs will comply with the 
requirements of NATO and the Security Council. If they don't, 
then they know there will be air strikes against them." 
  Mr Hurd and Mr Christopher met as a new international effort 
was launched in London to promote peace in Bosnia. 
  Officials from Russia, the United States and the EU 
[European 
Union] were meeting together for the first time as part of a new 
"contact" group with the aim of developing a co-ordinated 
approach to the former Yugoslavia. 
  Their aim is to seek a four-month "cessation of hostilities" 
-- an expression which will be increasingly heard in relation to 
Bosnia rather than "ceasefire" -- while work begins in shaping a 
new map of Bosnia. 
  During that period, the group would work with the Serbs and 
Bosnian Muslims on the map, the key to an overall settlement. 
  Implicit in this is that the map -- if it is agreed by the 
Serbs, the Muslims and the Croats -- will involve a "roll-back" 
by the Serbs from some of the positions they have occupied as a 
result of the hostilities. 
  Also during this period, the commander of UN forces in 
Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, would decide 
whether he wants to put troops in between the warring parties. 
  An official said: "It is virtually impossible to negotiate 
on 
the map and towards a peace settlement while people are killing 
each other." 
  Lord Owen will be represented on the contact group by three 
Europeans, British, French and German. The British 
representative is David Manning, head of the Foreign Office 
Eastern Department. 
  Today's meeting follows yesterday's high level discussions 
at 
Downing Street with ministers from Russia, the United States and 
France, where it was regarded that the bringing together of key 
players in the diplomatic arena would provide an additional 
"political punch" to the quest for peace. 
  The aim is to find a unified diplomatic position which will 
satisfy and influence the warring parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister John Major by Bernd Doerler </F>
and Olaf Ihlau in London; date not given: "We Determine 
Europe's Direction"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Prime Minister, are you governing 
an isolated, mediocre, and small nation? 
  [Major] We are not isolated, mediocre, and small. We never 
have been and never will be. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We are quoting the Archbishop of Canterbury 
George Carey. He has painted a rather gloomy picture of the 
state of Britain. 
  [Major] We have always been an globally-oriented countyy. No 
other country has invested more money abroad per capita than 
Great Britain. Only a few countries are so widely involved in 
foreign trade as we. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The spiritual head of the Church of England 
says that the biased promotion of the private sector and the 
brusque decline of the public sector have divided the nation and 
created an impoverished underclass -- a direct attack on 
Thatcherism and Majorism. 
  [Major] I know the archbishop very well. I do not think he 
meant that. Net income has gone up in every social class over 
the past 15 years. People are increasingly well off, even when 
one considers inflation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Not everyone, surely. Poverty is growing in 
your country. Take a look at the thousands of young homeless 
people on the streets of London. 
  [Major] They do not have to be on the streets. There is 
enough accommodation in London and other regions for them, but 
they simply do not want it. For many of them it is a question 
of culture. Some people make a conscious decision to live 
lonely lives. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Has Archbishop Carey's description of Britain 
anything to do with the country's loose relations with Europe, 
which over the past 31 years have made life difficult for eight 
prime ministers? 
  [Major] There is nothing to say about Great Britain's 
relationship with Europe. Just like every other European Union 
[EU] country, we have our own ideas about what is right for the 
EU, not because we have a British point of view but because we 
have a European one. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Could you give an example? 
  [Major] Why did I refuse to ratify the social clause in 
Maastricht? Because I believe the provisions of Maastricht make 
it more difficult for unemployed Europeans to find a job, and 
those who do have a job will lose it all the sooner. The 
reason: Wages in Europe are higher than among our overseas 
competitors the United States, Japan, or the countries of the 
Pacific region. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Unemployment in Europe is approaching the 20 
million mark. 
  [Major] Great Britain is the only major country in which 
unemployment is falling. One reason for this is that we have 
reached the next phase of the economic cycle. But our social 
costs are also lower than in the rest of Europe. Manpower is 
cheaper here, therefore there are higher investments, and 
employers are more willing to hire new people. 
  That is why I did not accept the Maastricht social clause. 
My arguments apply to the whole of Europe, and are not just a 
British oddity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Nevertheless one does not have the impression 
that Great Britain lies "in the heart of Europe" as you would 
like it to do. 
  [Major] What does "in the heart of Europe" mean? I have no 
intention of adhering to some EU fads if I am not convinced they 
are correct. Being in the heart of Europe means being able 
jointly to determine the rate of change. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In which spheres have you implemented this 
right to joint determination? 
  [Major] In the expansion of the EU, made possible through 
the alliance between Germany and Great Britain. After all, I 
can also claim to occupy a good position in matters concerning 
social guidelines and the principle of subsidiary; in this 
sphere, too, we and Germany have reversed the trend toward 
centralization. One quarter of EU legislation will either be 
abolished or reworded. We have pushed through our desires to a 
major extent also concerning the shape of the European budget 
until the end of the century. 
  Being in the middle of Europe does not mean competing 
against 
our EU partners to see who enjoys the greatest popularity. It 
means having a clear view of what should happen. We indeed 
determine Europe's direction. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Euroskeptics in your party still think 
Britain's real strength lies in isolation from the continent. 
  [Major] That is simply wrong. Only a tiny minority would 
prefer it if we did not belong to the EU. Most of the skeptics 
fear that we are letting ourselves become enmeshed in a 
centralized Europe, which they do not find attractive. But the 
overwhelming majority of Conservatives believe that Britain's 
place is in Europe, and they want us to play an increasing role 
in creating the kind if Europe that will emerge in the nearest 
future. 
  In case anyone doubts our commitment, let me tell him that 
my 
government has fought more political battles concerning the 
Maastricht treaty than the rest of Europe. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you yourself succumbed to an anti-European 
chauvinism when you and your EU partners started the dispute 
about blocking minorities and veto rights in the Council of 
Ministers. 
  [Major] No. If it is such a good idea to have a firm 
majority in order to implement resolutions, why was there such 
strong agreement with Germany and other countries that we should 
reform this system in 1996? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The forthcoming government conference is meant 
to discuss institutional reforms in order to make the EU more 
efficient and better able to reach decisions. 
  [Major] We are already opposed to a new majority vote, 
without waiting for 1996. One reason is that the Brussels 
Commission is trying, by means of Article 18 that deals with 
labor and trade union issues, to introduce the social charter 
through the back door. 
  If we were to increase the blocking minority in the Council 
of Ministers to 27 votes without seeking approval, in the coming 
months we would receive a whole series of decrees that are 
unacceptable to the British Parliament. I could not accept 
that. Not until we had been assured that there would be no 
further resolutions that would increase unemployment in this 
country did I grant my consent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If an association were to grow by 33 
percent, not even the International Cricket Conference, the 
governing body for your favorite sport, would avoid adopting a 
suitably modified veto right. 
  [Major] To adhere to your metaphor, when someone belongs to 
a club, is it not obvious that he should obey its rules? I will 
tell you what upsets me the most. Whenever necessary, Germany, 
France, Spain, and Italy defend anything they consider a matter 
of national interests, but no one accuses them of being 
anti-European when they do so. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is good, is it not? How do you explain 
it? 
  [Major] You should explain, not I. To be frank, I do not 
accept the empty accusation of us being anti-Europeans every 
time we hold a different stance to the one that is currently in 
fashion in the EU. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] On the continent, people still have the 
impression that Great Britain does not have its heart in the EU, 
and that it is merely interested in a more advantageous free 
trade zone. 
  [Major] That is wrong, and always has been. It might apply 
to a handful of people, but not to our government policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps the dispute about the blocking 
minority also has something to do with British fears of being 
involved in a German-dominated Europe or in a Franco-German 
European core. 
  [Major] That is nonsense. I have no fear of being 
imprisoned in a German-dominated united Europe, as you put it. 
The stances of Germany and Britain are similar on many topics, 
for instance on the subject of subsidiarity and an expansion of 
the EU. There has been complete accord between us on these 
important topics recently. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] London and Bonn also seem to share the biggest 
doubts about the European Monetary Union [EMU] . 
  [Major] My skepticism is based on the expected economic 
outcome of the EMU. Let us assume that the EMU comes into 
operation in 1997, 1998, or 1999, as planned. If we then have a 
common currency and want to be successful, all European economic 
mechanisms must be more efficient and linked more closely by 
then. But I do not know anyone who thinks even an approximation 
of the EMU can be achieved. Therefore there is not going to be 
an EMU. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So you are declaring the EMU defunct? 
  [Major] Even when we were still negotiating Maastricht, I 
said Europe would not be ready for a single currency in 1999. I 
was not displaying British chauvinism, merely economic judgment. 
I am still sure I am right. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think it is time to set greater 
emphasis 
on national identity once again? 
  [Major] National identity has never been erased. There are 
areas where one can pool national claims. There would then be a 
veto in security matters, in order to protect spheres of 
national interests. The remainder of the EU would not interfere 
with these. That is how the whole thing works. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Obviously, more things join the United Kingdom 
and Germany than divide them. But how do you explain the 
increasing discord in this partnership? 
  [Major] I see no political differences between the 
governments. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Was that just an invention of the media? 
  [Major] Obviously your information is based on the results 
of the latest opinion poll whereby the British and Germans do 
not trust each other so much. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] According to this poll, the British and 
Germans have less trust in each other than in the case of the 
Americans and Japanese. 
  [Major] That was a rather irrelevant question. Whenever I 
am in the company of British and Germans, there is consensus on 
most issues. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you cannot deny that Britain fears a 
Germany that determines the balance of power in the center of 
Europe. 
  [Major] Yes, I can. In any case, I have no such fear. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But your predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, did. 
  [Major] I cannot speak for her. When German unification 
occurred, I considered this event historically inevitable. We 
welcomed it, and were right to do so. Chancellor Kohl had no 
choice but to push the unification process through. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In that case, how do you explain all the 
anti-German remarks and cartoons in parts of the British press? 
  [Major] I cannot speak on behalf of the British press. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There are also differences of opinion 
concerning the forthcoming celebrations of the 50th anniversary 
of D-Day. Chancellor Kohl would like to attend a ceremony of 
reconciliation. 
  [Major] As far as I know, Helmut never wanted to be involved 
in these celebrations. Next year, on the 50th anniversary of 
the end of the war, there will be joint appearances and 
ceremonies of reconciliation. Germany will take part then. But 
this is not up to me. This is something that has to be 
discussed with a lot of people and organizations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are meeting Chancellor Kohl this week. 
Should the debate on basic EU principles--scheduled for 
1996--not cover European security and military policy as well? 
  [Major] The chancellor and I have met many times. Our 
meetings are free and uninhibited. We will probably hold most 
of our talks during a walk at my country seat, Chequers. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps you will take Kohl to the sauna for 
some sweating, like Boris Yeltsin? 
  [Major] I have no sauna at Chequers, unfortunately. We will 
certainly also discuss what plans Germany has for its EU 
presidency in the second half of 1994. That will be a major 
topic. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Kohl has already said that he will cooperate 
with the French very closely. They will take over the EU 
presidency after Germany. 
  [Major] I hope he cooperates closely with all partners. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There is little trace of joint West European 
action in the Balkans. Why has the EU failed in Bosnia? 
  [Major] I think the EU did act jointly, but it happened 
under the auspices of the United Nations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Now and then, concerning, for example, the 
dispute on the acceptance of Slovenia and Croatia, it looks as 
if West Europe has reverted to the old patterns of mistrust that 
existed at the beginning of this century. 
  [Major] At the beginning of the civil war in Bosnia there 
were only three options: to remain completely outside the 
conflict and let the warring sides simply do what they wanted. 
The second option would have meant that the Western democracies 
stop the war in former Yugoslavia. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And attack with their forces. 
  [Major] Do you know what would have happened then? A war 
has never been won with the sole use of air power. Even in Iraq, 
it was the ground forces that determined the outcome. Down in 
the Balkans we are dealing with 200,000 armed Serbs, Croats, and 
Bosnians, who are fighting in hilly terrain. How many NATO 
troops would we have to deploy in order to end the fighting? 
The military reckon 400,000 or more would be needed today. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Today, perhaps. But nothing like that number 
would have been needed if the West had undertaken action two 
years ago. 
  [Major] No, no. This figure was established already at the 
beginning of the civil war, 400,000 soldiers. Where were they 
supposed to come from? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Certainly not from Germany. 
  [Major] I know that. But not from other countries, either. 
The truth is that we cannot deploy 400,000 soldiers. We British 
have sent troops on humanitarian missions. And that was the 
third option -- to steer a solution and in the meantime do 
everything possible to step up humanitarian aid. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And what is the result of this policy in 
Bosnia today? The Serbs have been able to attain their 
territorial objectives, and a peace treaty to cement these gains 
would also sanction ethnic expulsion. 
  [Major] Are you asking questions, or do you wish to discuss 
things with me? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Both. 
  [Major] We do not know how matters will end yet. It is 
obvious that the boundaries must be redrawn. Everyone should 
now discuss this. And if you insist that troops should have 
been sent in, I would certainly like to know where these troops 
were supposed to have come from. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If the Serbian aggressors extend their ethnic 
conflict to Kosovo and Macedonia, I do not suppose you will 
attack either. 
  [Major] We will deal with this matter when it happens. But 
in any case, I am not going to sit and argue with you about what 
we are going to do. In any case, it has not yet happened. One 
reason for this is the presence of United Nations units there. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What sort of involvement in the Balkan 
conflict do you expect from the Germans, with their 
constitutional restraints and historical burden? 
  [Major] The Germans have assumed a great burden in this war. 
One cannot underestimate the financial costs they have incurred 
by accepting Balkan refugees. That is an extraordinary 
commitment and a highly conspicuous contribution. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Prime Minister, in the wake of all the 
Euroturbulence, your leadership qualities are once again under 
fire, especially within your own party. Is it a consolation to 
you that right now most European government leaders are losing 
their electorates because of the economic recession and social 
misery? 
  [Major] Quite so. All over Europe, even in Great Britain, 
people feel bitter about their politicians right now. This is 
mainly because of the recession, which has proved longer and 
more severe than we thought. All the rows in European 
parliaments about European policy have only made this miserable 
mood even more miserable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Right now you have one thing in common with 
Chancellor Kohl -- bad popularity ratings. What do you say to 
those who claim that neither of you will be in office by the end 
of the year? 
  [Major] I have a lot to do and no time to indulge in such 
speculation. But let me recall the period before the last 
elections. Everyone was convinced I would not win. That was 
two years ago, and I expect to be able to answer your questions 
for some time yet. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are fond of saying that politics is a 
rough business. But you would rather go yourself than be thrown 
out of office? 
  [Major] I will go when people least expect it. Until then I 
still have a lot to take care of. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Prime 
Minister.

<F P=106> [By Deric Henderson] </F>
  [Text] The Irish peace initiative is in danger of going 
into crisis, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said tonight. 
  The wide and deep gap between the party and the British 
Government over the Downing Street declaration needed to be 
bridged. 
  Peace did not come in one great and all encompassing 
gesture, 
he said. It required the building of trust, imagination, 
courage, and gestures of goodwill which should not be arrogantly 
dismissed or thrown back. 
  Mr Adams told a European election meeting of his party in 
Londonderry: "Regrettably the peace process is stalled. It has 
been stalled for too long. There is now a real possibility that 
we may move into a crisis and the opportunity which exists will 
be lost. We must all redouble our efforts to prevent this from 
happening." 
  Since the signing of the peace declaration by the British 
and 
Irish Governments last December, the Prime Minister and the 
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew have refused Sinn 
Fein demands for clarification. 
  Mr Adams said tonight that the document was so ambiguously 
drafted, it was open to all sorts of differing interpretations. 
  Earlier this month the IRA, which has yet to make a decision 
on the document, announced a three-day truce. But the effort by 
Sinn Fein to utilise that suspension to break the political 
stalemate had been arrogantly dismissed, according to Mr Adams. 
He claimed: "It appears to indicate a British Government 
stubbornly refusing to break from the failed policies of the 
past. This is clearly not good enough. It we are to bring an 
end to the violence which every generation has had to endure we 
need clarity and a willingness to adopt pragmatic political 
strategies and see developments in the long term. It has been 
variously reported and speculated that Mr Major's refusal to 
break the obstruction around the clarification issue is linked 
to his concern about the Conservative right, and his dependency 
upon the Unionists. If this is true and if he lacks the 
political nerve to deal with this relatively simple matter, how 
can he hope to tackle the infinitely more difficult decisions 
which lie ahead in any peace process?" said Mr Adams. 
  "Are our hopes for peace to be blocked by the Tory right 
wing 
and the Unionists? Mr Major is not alone in having 
difficulties. We all have them. But they have to be 
overcome...." 
  The IRA's three-day suspension was an "exceptional 
initiative 
which created an unparalled opportunity." But the British had 
closed the door on that initiative as well. 
  The Sinn Fein president added: "What is required is a new 
and 
imaginative approach which tilts the balance away from this 
negative power of veto and towards the positive power of 
democracy, agreement and consent. The British Government holds 
the veto. Its removal would unlock the situation and create the 
catalyst for real change." 
  The Governemnt's current policy he claimed, was effectively 
thwarting the efforts to remove the obstacles which were 
blocking progress. He added: "Consequently the peace initiative 
in which all of us have invested considerable time and effort 
and much hope, is in danger of going into crisis. We must all 
redouble our efforts to prevent this from happening." 
  Mr Adams said the gap which seperated republicans from the 
British was wide and deep, but was one that had to be bridged. 
They needed to know and understand each others views and to be 
clear on each others long term intentions. 
  He said: "The British Government regrettably appears 
unwilling to look beyond its narrow political agenda and grasp 
the opportunity for peace which still exists." 
  Republicans had consistently indicated over recent years, 
but 
particularly the last 12 months, their determination to do what 
they could to achieve peace. Their bona fides in this respect 
were impeccable. 
  Mr Adams said: "There now exists for the first time in 25 
years a real opportunity to advance beyond the failures and 
violence of the past. It requires imagination, hard work, 
realism and a deep seated desire to make it happen."

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Armed Forces are not a luxury and excessive cuts 
will damage Britain's security and reputation, Defence Secretary 
Malcolm Rifkind warned the Treasury today. 
  The warning came as ministers and senior officials this week 
prepared to draw up final recommendations for spending 
reductions in a bid to find 2.3 billion pounds sterling savings 
in line with Treasury demands. 
  Mr Rifkind set out his stall in the annual Defence White 
Paper, which officials admitted was necessarily "bland" because 
the Front Line First review would not be completed until July. 
  "Our Armed Forces are widely regarded -- and rightly -- as a 
valuable and prestigious national asset," the White Paper said. 
  "The possession of such an asset is not a luxury; and it is 
not something we could surrender without grave injury to the 
security and reputation of this country." 
  Strong Armed Forces were essential so long as Britain wanted 
to play an active part in international affairs. Although the 
end of the Cold War was welcomed, nationalism and extremism were 
"sadly" on the march. It would be many years before it became 
clear whether Russia -- with its huge arsenal of weapons -- 
would be able to develop into a permanent friend of the West and 
a stable democracy. 
  "We do not intend to take risks with our security," said the 
White Paper. "The penalties for misjudgment would be too severe." 
  Yet the Front Line First review -- also known as the Defence 
Cost Studies -- is expected to slash thousands of military and 
civilian jobs in the support areas and axe hundreds of buildings 
and centres. 
  Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley, Defence Procurement 
Minister Jonathan Aitken and Junior Defence Minister Lord 
Cranbourne meet the Front Line First's so-called executive group 
on Thursday to discuss recommendations. 
  Since December, 33 studies have been carried out into the 
entire support sector in a bid to find the necessary savings. 
These studies -- apart from two -- are now complete and will be 
discussed by the ministerial/executive group, which includes 
Christopher Littmoden from Marks &amp; Spencer. 
  A final package of recommendations will be put together from 
the various studies and presented to Mr Rifkind in the middle of 
next month. But the key proposals include a 20,000 cut in 
civilian and military manpower, with the RAF [Royal Air Force] 
particularly targeted. 
  One aim is to cut the billions of pounds worth of spares and 
stocks held by the military by by well over half. The RAF 
stockholders are almost entirely in uniform, whereas the Army's 
are half military and half civilian employees. 
  Ministers are determined that the job should be almost 
entirely privatised, as civilian workers cost about half as much 
as a serviceman. Thus, RAF manpower will tumble to well below 
the 70,000 ceiling it will reach next April under the Options 
for Change cuts. 
  The MoD [Ministry of Defense] headquarters in London is 
another prime target with more than 3,000 posts likely to be 
axed, together with a cut of a fifth in the 11,000-strong 
Procurement Executive, which oversees the purchase of all new 
equipment. 
  The number of senior military officers from the rank of 
brigadier -- and their civilian equivalents -- upwards will be 
cut by at least 20 percent. Large numbers of expensive-to-run 
buildings such as the staff colleges of the Royal Navy at 
historic Greenwich, south London, and the RAF at Bracknell, 
Berkshire, are likely to be shut, with joint tri-service courses 
being run at the Army's equivalent at Camberley, Surrey. One of 
the most politically contentious issues is the naval base at 
Rosyth in Fife, which the Royal Navy has recommended for closure 
with warships moved to Portsmouth. 
  Labour has alredy warned that the proposals threaten the 
entire structure of Britain's security, and party leader John 
Smith has called for a full defence review, warning there were 
too many "piecemeal cuts." 
  Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said the 
White Paper was "substantially undermined" by the Front Line 
First review.

<F P=106> [By Amanda Brown, PRESS ASSOCIATION health correspondent] </F>
  [Text] An early warning system aimed at identifying a 
nuclear accident abroad was unveiled today -- the eighth 
anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Rimnet, the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network, can 
identify raised levels of nuclear fall-out, enabling UK-based 
emergency services to spring into action. 
  Environment Minister Robert Atkins told a London news 
conference: ``Any significant increase in radiation levels 
detected by the monitors will raise an alert on the Rimnet 
system and trigger alarms in continuously manned offices at my 
department. 
  ``If Rimnet had been operating at the time of the Chernobyl 
accident, it would have indicated clearly where levels of 
radioactivity in the UK rose above normal background 
variations.'' 
  The system, which has monitoring stations across the 
country, 
can track radiation clouds by using sophisticated data and 
mapping equipment, while Government departments could alert 
water companies, local authorities and firms in the event of an 
accident. 
  The system will record measurements of radioactivity levels 
in air, water, food and people and store them on a database.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Return to War Areas"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 25 Apr -- In Bonn on Monday [25 April], 
Interior Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) and 
Croatian Interior Minister Jarnjak signed an agreement "on the 
reacceptance of persons" that controls the issue of repatriating 
Croatian refugees from Germany to their homeland. The two 
governments agree to a two-phased procedure that takes into 
account the destruction and occupation of Croatian areas by the 
Serbs. Basically, it will be possible to send Croatian refugees 
back to their country from 1 May onwards. However, the agreement 
contains an exception clause. "The repatriation of former war 
refugees, whose origin from a locality situated in damaged, 
fought for, or occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia can be 
proved, as well as Croatian war refugees from the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be provisionally discontinued until 
January," says the agreement. A Croatian diplomatic 
representation in Germany must certify that these criteria 
apply. Refugees from occupied or damaged areas should be 
repatriated from Germany even before January 1995 if a 
cease-fire comes into effect in Bosnia-Herzegovina or if 
Croatia, for its part, "commences the repatriation of war 
refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Kanther said that the acceptance of refugees as an act of 
charity should not be construed as a "permanent right of abode." 
Croatia needs people to reconstruct the country, he said. 
Germany will help Croatia obtain help from the European Union 
[EU]. Kanther promised that Germany would support negotiations 
on a cooperation agreement between the EU and Croatia. On the 
subject of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kanther said that Germany would 
also consider the situation in that country when repatriating 
refugees. However, the principle remains whereby once the war 
is ended, there is no reason to accept refugees in Germany. 
Acting Croatian Prime Minister Kostovic said his government was 
holding talks with the Bosnian Government on the subject of 
repatriating refugees, but nothing has been decided because of 
the situation in Bosnia. There will be a conference on this 
subject in Ljubljana in the beginning of May, under the aegis of 
the United Nations. 
  Kostovic pointed out that his country has accepted 280,000 
refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Another 250,000 Croatian 
refugees have fled from Serb-occupied areas. There are only 800 
vacancies in refugee camps operated by the Croatian Government. 
According to Croatian Government data, the first phase of 
implementing the agreement will not pose an excessive burden on 
Croatia. The returning refugees could be accommodated in their 
former homes. The accommodation of Croats from Serb-occupied 
areas will be more difficult. Kostovic expressed his thanks for 
the German Government's help. The Croatian Government claims 
there are 70,000 Croatian refugees in Germany. Some 20,000 of 
them come from Serb-occupied areas. The interior ministers of 
the German laender resolved last year that the reprieve on 
deporting Croatian refugees would expire at the end of January, 
but this deadline was subsequently extended to the end of April. 
In February, the conference of interior ministers adopted a 
two-phase procedure that takes into account the marital status 
and regional origin of refugees. 
  During the negotiations, the Croatian side assured the 
German 
Government that it has declared an amnesty for Croatian citizens 
who avoided military service or deserted between August 1990 and 
September 1992. "Croatia guarantees the protection of human 
rights; discrimination over race, religion, ethnic origin, sex, 
social connections, and political opinion is out of the 
question," says a note from the Croatian Government.

  [Excerpts] Burg (DDP/ADN) -- Today the 10th Russian Guards 
Tank Division left Altengrabow Garrison in Burg district. This 
means that the last major combat unit of the former Soviet 
forces in Saxony-Anhalt is now on its way home. 
  Wolfgang Rauls, deputy prime minister and land environment 
minister, stressed that there has been extensive personal 
contacts between local people and the members of the division, 
despite the odd problem with living side by side over the past 
few years. [passage omitted] 
  Before the withdrawal agreement there were around 100,000 
Russian soldiers as well as 40,000 civilian employees and family 
members stationed in Saxony-Anhalt. They were based at a total 
of 276 locations.

South Africa"] 
  [Text] For the first time in South Africa's history, all 
citizens, no matter what the color of their skin is, will elect 
a joint government this week. The horrible apartheid system 
will finally be buried this April 1994. 
  Germany helped to prepare the elections. In these days, 100 
German election observers are at the Cape. For years, we have 
supported antiapartheid organizations -- with almost 500 million 
German marks since 1975. At the same time, we always held a 
critical dialogue with the South African Government. This 
farsighted policy of the Federal Government is now bearing fruit. 
  In early September I will extend invitations to a conference 
in Berlin for promotion of the economy in southern Africa. 
Together with our partners in the European Union, we must and 
will support South Africa now with a comprehensive relief 
program in the difficult transition period.

<F P=106> ["sha"-signed report: "Companies Remain in Waiting </F>
Position"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- German companies seem to be waiting for 
the outcome of elections in South Africa. Direct investment in 
South Africa has stagnated at around 2 billion German marks [DM] 
since 1989. Martin Kraemer, manager of the Africa Association, 
is content if German investors are able to keep their position 
at all. Well-established companies, such as Bayer, BMW, 
Hoechst, Mercedes, Siemens, or Volkswagen might manage a smooth 
transition to the time after the elections. Yet, as many as 300 
German companies, that is about half of all German investors in 
Africa, are represented in South Africa, employing a total of 
36,000 staff. 
  According to the Africa Association, the fact that German 
exporters could maintain their business with the continent's 
most important trading partner "in spite of the reform process" 
is a success. While German exports stagnated at DM3.27 billion, 
German imports from South Africa declined by 18 percent, to 
DM1.95 billion, last year. After sanctions were lifted, South 
Africa increased its exports of gold, copper, manganese, and 
other ores to the Far East, East Europe, and the Middle East. 
  The Federal Government, which will hold the European Union 
[EU] presidency in the second half of 1994, is skeptical about 
African National Congress politicians' attempts to join the Lome 
Agreement with the EU. The accession process is too lengthy, 
and the system for stabilizing raw materials prices would not 
cope very well with the membership of raw-materials supplier 
South Africa, Christian Democratic Party development expert 
Volkmar Koehler said at the African Economic Day in Hamburg. 
Also, membership of the threshold country would lower the 
amount of aid for the total 69 poor countries in Africa, the 
Caribbean, and the Pacific area (ACP). Not only would all ACP 
and EU countries have to agree to membership, but it is also 
doubtful whether South Africa would meet the criteria of a 
developing country.

  [Excerpts] Burg (DDP/ADN) -- Today the 10th Russian Guards 
Tank Division left Altengrabow Garrison in Burg district. This 
means that the last major combat unit of the former Soviet 
forces in Saxony-Anhalt is now on its way home. 
  Wolfgang Rauls, deputy prime minister and land environment 
minister, stressed that there has been extensive personal 
contacts between local people and the members of the division, 
despite the odd problem with living side by side over the past 
few years. [passage omitted] 
  Before the withdrawal agreement there were around 100,000 
Russian soldiers as well as 40,000 civilian employees and family 
members stationed in Saxony-Anhalt. They were based at a total 
of 276 locations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party </F>
of Austria; place and date not given: "The FDP Will Become 
Insignificant"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] West Europe's popular conservative 
parties are in danger of falling apart. Is this the hour that 
you have been waiting for? 
  [Haider] Citizens are now rejecting the forms of government 
that they previously accepted as the lesser evil in view of the 
communist threat. These parties are too large and too 
inflexible to respond to serious change. It is no longer 
possible to turn a 1950's Borgward into a racing vehicle. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are proposing a pan-European "liberation 
course." What does that mean? 
  [Haider] In Italy, Austria, and Germany, new political 
parties are being formed outside the framework of the old 
parties. Our common concern is autonomy, an end to corruption, 
and the strengthening of the plebiscite elements of the 
rule-of-law state. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] A truly mixed movement extending from Le Pen 
to Haider? 
  [Haider] Not at all. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But it does include Gerhard Frey and his 
German People's Union? 
  [Haider] What makes you think that? Mr. Frey only 
acknowledges himself and would rather come to nothing than 
become part of a movement. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So, your man is Schoenhuber? 
  [Haider] People who hold extremist, reactionary ideas do not 
belong in a democratic renewal movement. The Republikaner have 
not gotten beyond the stage of being a protest party of the 
right. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This curt distinction that you have made does 
not sound convincing. 
  [Haider] There are many Republikaner who would feel better 
in another movement. There are cultured people such the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg group leader Rolf Schlier, who I find to be 
an interesting conversation partner. However, he will not get 
any further under Schoenhuber. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Where are your allies in Europe? 
  [Haider] I consider liberal parties to include the group 
around Giscard d'Estaing in France, the Liga Norda, the 
Suedtirol Liberal Party in Italy, the Radical Democratic Party 
in Switzerland, and the Association of Free Citizens in Germany, 
which was founded by former Bavarian FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
land chairman Manfred Brunner. There are contacts with all 
those groups, and cross-border activities will probably be 
launched shortly. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will you support Manfred Brunner in the 
European elections? 
  [Haider] From time to time, I feel the need to correct all 
the untruths that are being spread about me in Germany. That 
accords well with Manfred Brunner's initiative, and he is an 
interesting fellow. In any event, this year I will be 
addressing FDP local associations at their invitation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There is an FDP presidium resolution that 
rules out cooperation with you. Who has invited you? 
  [Haider] Several courageous local associations in southern 
and central Germany. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How do you rate the prospects for a right-wing 
populist party in Germany? 
  [Haider] There will probably be a grand coalition in Germany 
in the short term, and only then will a new force be able to 
establish itself, a liberal party that will address practical 
problems, will be able to succeed without the Republikaners' 
customary excessive stress on nationalist matters, and could 
obtain between 15 and 20 percent of the vote. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So, what room is left for the FDP? 
  [Haider] I expect the party to become insignificant. If it 
continues to defend the system and only tries to gain as much as 
possible from what exists at present, it will shortly be 
superfluous.

<F P=106> ["df"-signed report: "Environmental and Social Differences </F>
Must Be Accepted"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In a speech delivered to the IHK 
[Chamber of Industry and Commerce] in Stuttgart, President Hans 
Peter Stihl, president of the DIHT [Federation of German 
Chambers of Industry and Commerce], welcomed the fact that GATT 
has now acquired a firm institutional framework and a legal form 
of governance, as well as the ability to impose its 
international regulations and to punish violations. Through the 
World Trade Organization (WTO), GATT regulations have finally 
obtained -- GATT being a part of that organization -- the 
international force of law. 
  The precise and binding process of settling multilateral 
disputes is of particular importance within the WTO framework. 
This means that threats and bilateral restrictions will no 
longer have a legal basis. Stihl said: "What that means in 
effect is that the law of the jungle will no longer apply in 
international trade policy." 
  However, despite the Uruguay agreement and the establishment 
of the WTO, many questions remain open, such as the links 
between world trade on the one hand and aspects of 
environmental, social, and competitiveness policy on the other 
hand. According to the Stihl, the DIHT position is as follows: 
  Environmental standards naturally have a direct impact on 
companies' competitiveness. Some Western countries view the 
differences compared to developing countries as a blatant 
distortion of competition. 
  Thus, this has given rise to the demand for a harmonization 
of standards. Stihl: "I have doubts about whether we should 
force our environmental standards, which are restrictive on 
trade, on less developed trading partners. Just imagine a 
country in black Africa suddenly having to introduce a clean air 
or sewage charge just to be able to trade with us. That would 
be absurd." 
  The question of minimum social standards has also recently 
been linked to trade policy in countries such as the United 
States, France, and southern EU [European Union] countries above 
all. However, there are also some people in the FRG, for 
example, in the unions and the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany], who are of the opinion that German social standards 
must be recommended to other countries. 
  According to Stihl, these other countries owe their 
competitive advantages internationally to modest social 
standards and the favorable cost structures that those entail. 
This particularly applies to the former socialist states of 
East Europe: "To want to measure their social standards 
according to the criteria of our affluent society that provides 
for all needs amounts to cynicism." 
  A further topic is the harmonization of national policy on 
competition. In one country, company mergers may constitute a 
violation of the law on cartels, whereas in another country, 
they may receive massive support for competitive reasons. 
  This undoubtedly gives rise to serious distortions. However, 
Stihl cannot imagine a "world cartel office" or a general, 
internationally accepted law on competition. An adequate 
consensus on basic rules governing the free market economy and 
competition is lacking. "What does seem realistic to me is the 
introduction and raising of national minimum standards and their 
gradual harmonization." 
  The problem of harmonizing export controls remains unsolved. 
The export of goods that can or could serve civilian or 
military uses is subject to severe restrictions in Germany. 
  Other countries do not have such a mass of export controls. 
Thus, foreign competition enjoys immense advantages. The FRG is 
seeking harmonization within the framework of the EU. 
  The results that negotiations have yielded to date are 
disappointing: "Everything points to a sham harmonization 
allowing everyone to maintain his national standards: we will 
maintain high ones and our neighbors will maintain low ones." 
  A further threat to world trade is posed by the fact that 
the 
world economy is increasingly breaking up into regional trade 
zones. Since GATT came into force in 1948, over 80 preferential 
regional accords have been concluded, of which very few are in 
keeping with the actual provisions of the GATT treaty and 
scarcely one is in keeping with its spirit. 
  It is estimated that by the year 2000, over half of world 
trade will be conducted within preferential regional zones. 
Stihl: "However, it must be ensured that if internal walls 
collapse, external walls are not raised." 
  Stihl is very concerned about bilateralism, which is 
assuming 
increasingly aggressive forms in international economics. In 
bilateral "managed trade," two-page agreements that can scarcely 
be described as "voluntary" constitute a danger to the 
international trade order. The most-favored principle is 
circumvented and market shares are simply allocated and the free 
market is taken out of operation. 
  Both the EU and the United States are to blame for that. 
Just a few weeks ago, the commission in Brussels yet again 
forced through an agreement with Japan on two-way automobile 
exports. This has protected automakers in selected EU member 
states from the rise in exports in the Japanese automobile 
industry. 
  The United States, bolstered by the powerful protective 
instruments of national trade legislation, also practice this 
form of trade by government accord. It has concluded agreements 
with Japan on the semicondcutor industry and recently on mobile 
telephones. 
  If bilateral agreements cannot be avoided, then their 
results 
must subsequently be given a multilateral form. It would, of 
course, be better if the United States and the EU were to come 
up with a common policy for Japan.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Free Democratic Party [FDP] is 
sticking for the time being to its stance that the size of the 
Bundeswehr should not be reduced from 370,000 men. Klaus 
Kinkel, FDP chairman and FRG foreign minister, said following a 
meeting of the FDP presidium in Bonn today that the government 
coalition meeting tomorrow must consider whether there are no 
other areas where savings could be made. At the same time, he 
stressed that despite the policy document submitted on the 
weekend by Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, a "whole host 
of issues" remains open.

<F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "Ruehe Settles Dispute With Union's </F>
Defense Experts"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The dispute among security experts of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] on 
the future of the Bundeswehr has been settled. At a meeting in 
Siegen, the Bundestag group's working group on defense accepted 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's concept without any major 
changes. It provides for cutting Bundeswehr troops from 370,000 
to 340,000 and for reducing compulsory military service from 12 
to 10 months. Ruehe will have to win the approval of the CDU/CSU 
Bundestag group today. On Monday [25 April], Free Democratic 
Party [FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel seemed once again to be 
uncertain about whether to agree to the troop reductions. 
  CDU/CSU Defense Policy Spokesman Paul Breuer said after the 
meeting on Monday that the Bundestag group experts consider a 
10-month military service in the main defense forces possible. 
This is the part of the troops used for national defense. 
Anyone who voluntarily does his service in the crisis-reaction 
forces, must, however, serve for 12 months. 
  The working group says that the name "Soldier for Months 
(SaM)," describing soldiers serving in the crisis-reaction 
forces, has been dropped in favor of "W-12." This clearly shows 
that the crisis-reaction forces used for missions abroad are 
committed to society by their compulsory military service. The 
10-month military service does, however, not imply a shorter 
alternative service, because those doing military service do not 
get compensatory time off and face higher demands. 
  The working group's resolution document also says that the 
Bundeswehr must remain in a position to be extended to 370,000 
troops in the event of an emergency. The necessary structures 
must be maintained. But still, some of the sites could be 
closed down, Breuer said. But this cannot be discussed before 
the Defense Ministry's concept has been completed. 
  The working group demanded that profits be achieved through 
rationalizations and cuts, stay in the defense budget. The 
deputies also said that the number of civilian Bundeswehr 
employees and their organization must be balanced against the 
military part of the Bundeswehr. This means that of the 
existing 151,000 civilian staff, 20,000 could be laid off. 
  Speaking after his party's presidium meeting on Monday, FDP 
Chairman Klaus Kinkel said a strength of 370,000 troops remains 
desirable, particularly for foreign-policy reasons. But he said 
he could also see the bottlenecks in the Bundeswehr budget. The 
FDP has never been opposed to reducing the Bundeswehr strength. 
Yet, alternatives have to be considered first. Kinkel and FDP 
Secretary General Werner Hoyer think that Ruehe's concept leaves 
many questions unanswered. The CDU/CSU group wants to discuss 
Ruehe's plans today. Resistance is expected from several 
deputies. Breuer said that the meeting will once again bring 
"sweat to Ruehe's brow."

<F P=106> [Interview with FDP Bundestag Group Chairman Hermann Otto </F>
Solms by F. Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: "Coalition 
-- Fight Over Taxes Aggravating!"] 
  [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] Will the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] make its coalition statement in favor of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] 
subject to any conditions? 
  [Solms] Yes. We will tell the voters in good time before 
the elections which liberal principles are indispensable for us. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] What are the most important touchstones for 
the FDP? 
  [Solms] It starts with simple issues, such as rejection of 
the speed limit and of the increase in mineral oil taxes. We 
are for, not against, cars. We demand more parking space to 
prevent inner cities from depopulating, as well as a rapid 
construction of roads running east-west, funded by private means 
and by further measures. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] The FDP's demand to check the solidarity 
surcharge after three years is unanimously rejected by the 
CDU/CSU. Are you going to stick to this position? 
  [Solms] By all means; this is one of the most important 
touchstones of the coalition. The least that can be done is to 
check the solidarity surcharge at regular intervals and to start 
gradually removing it after three years. We want to lower taxes 
in other fields as well to create jobs: Anyone investing in new 
jobs will pay less in taxes. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Everyone is talking about public austerity 
measures. How do you want to put this into effect? 
  [Solms] It all begins within the government machinery. With 
the FDP, there will be fewer ministries in the future: The 
Ministries for Family and the Elderly, Women, Young People, and 
Health will be combined into one again. The Ministry for 
Education and Research will be turned into a Ministry for 
Future-Oriented Affairs. The Ministries for Transport and 
Housing Construction could be combined into an Infrastructure 
Ministry, together with the Ministry for Postal and 
Telecommunications Affairs. Lufthansa will be privatized. The 
total number of state secretaries will be cut by one-third. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] The European authorities will get away 
unscathed? 
  [Solms] These must be cut down as well. The European Union 
[EU] is violating the Maastricht Treaty with its excess 
bureaucracy. We have to put an end to the regulation mania. It 
is nonsense to have Brussels telling us from where we may import 
our bananas, or how many kilograms a German worker is allowed to 
lift. At the same time, the EU fails to act when it comes to 
remedying bad situations, down to the field of health affairs, 
in order to prevent catastrophes like Mad Cow Disease [Bovine 
Spongiform Encephalopathy -- BSE] from spreading. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] The CDU and CSU insist on the great bugging 
campaign against suspect major criminals.... 
  [Solms] This would not help the fight against mass crimes, 
the point where we have to start. We must strengthen police and 
we need more posts on the federal and laender levels, better 
training and equipment, better international cooperation. We 
also need a legal reform that speeds up judicial procedures and 
introduces a compensation scheme for victims.

<F P=106> [Interview with Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the North </F>
Rhine-Westphalian FDP, by Rolf Kleine; place and date not given: 
"Moellemann: `He Who Acts Will Make Mistakes!'"] 
  [Text] [Kleine] At the Free Democratic Party [FDP] land 
congress you were reelected chairman with 59.6 percent of the 
vote -- your worst result? 
  [Moellemann] He who wants to make a mark for himself will 
also make mistakes and have critics! This is also true for me. 
One has to live with it. Besides, results of 90 percent are 
abnormal for democracies. More dangerous than the decrease in 
support in the election of a land chairman is the sustained loss 
of votes achieved by the FDP in elections. The question is: 
How can we surmount this low point? 
  [Kleine] How can you? 
  [Moellemann] The FDP must make it clear that we will no 
longer put up with the enormous increase in our horrendous 
national debts! Moreover, we must stimulate the economy and 
create jobs. And the FDP must advocate more strongly the 
reduction of bureaucracy: Fewer ministries! Fewer deputies! 
Fewer laender! 
  [Kleine] Is this a coalition offer to the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD]? 
  [Moellemann] No! The SPD does not really want to reduce 
bureaucracy and really cut corporate taxes. Yet, one thing is 
true: There are no major differences on central issues between 
the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the SPD.

  [Text] Six months before the Bundestag elections, the 
Germans are convinced that there will be a change of government, 
and they welcome that. According to the Emnid poll commissioned 
by SPIEGEL for April, 58 percent of those eligible to vote 
believe that the present climate is particularly favorable for 
the Social Democrats; the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU 
[Christian Social Union] is well behind with 13 percent. Even a 
large majority of CDU/CSU voters believe that there will be a 
change of government in the fall. 
  The CDU/CSU's image is pretty terrible in the new laender 
especially. Irrespective of whether the issues are 
unemployment, safeguarding pensions, combating crime, housing 
construction, foreigners, or economic growth, in 14 out of 17 
particularly important policy areas, only the Social Democrats 
are credited with the ability to solve problems (eight out of 17 
in western Germany). 
  The CDU/CSU is only just ahead of the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] on the issue of "limiting state debt." 
According to the east Germans, the CDU/CSU and the Social 
Democrats are equal on "ensuring law and order." In the case of 
environmental policy, the Greens are well ahead with 33 percent. 
  In eastern Germany, representatives of the SPD are 
particularly popular, especially Brandenburg's Social Affairs 
Minister Regine Hildebrandt. A total of 68 percent of voters 
want the controversial politician to play an important role in 
the future -- in the west the figure is 40 percent. In the case 
of Brandenburg's Minister President Manfred Stolpe, the figure 
is 51 percent among east German citizens and only 35 percent 
among west German citizens. 
  There is not much of a difference in west Germans' and east 
Germans' assessment of Republikaner boss Franz Schoenhuber. In 
contrast to what has been suspected, an astonishing 11 percent 
accord the right-winger an important role in politics, whereas 
in the west, the figure is as high as 15 percent. 
  Federal Justice Minister Sabine Luetheusser-Schnarrenberger, 
FDP [Free Democratic Party] is more popular with the public than 
within her own party. A total of 34 percent of CDU/CSU voters 
(and 38 percent of FDP voters) want the opponent of bugging to 
have an important role in politics and 41 percent in the case of 
the SPD and the Greens. 
  And who can govern with whom following 16 October? The SPD 
(38 percent) and the Greens (9 percent) have at least an 
arithmetical majority.

<F P=106> ["Election-ZEIT" poll conducted by Infratest Burke Berlin </F>
for DIE ZEIT: "The Camps Are Taking Shape"] 
  [Text]The election campaign has not really started yet and 
the electorate has not reached any unequivocal and stable 
decisions at all. The voters can still be swayed. 
  These findings have had a particular impact on Rudolf 
Scharping in the intervening weeks between our first poll (on 
which we reported in the 11 March 1994 issue of DIE ZEIT) and 
this second "Election-ZEIT" poll. Scharping, the chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party (SPD), is still ahead of Helmut Kohl 
when it comes to the response to the hypothetical question of 
which candidate people would vote for "if a direct election for 
chancellor could be held." But Scharping slipped from 42 to 39 
percent while Kohl climbed from 28 to 33 percent. The total 
shift of 8 percentage points is larger than Scharping's 
remaining 6-percent lead. Our poll, conducted during the week of 
14 March to 22 March, also reflects the somewhat unprofessional 
way in which Scharping presented his proposal for a tax hike. Is 
his drop in the poll merely indicative of a momentary reaction 
or a loss of some significance? 
  Detailed analysis of the figures shows that both Scharping 
and Kohl made gains only among the voters of eastern Germany. 
Scharping gained 11 percentage points and Kohl gained 3 percent. 
The percentage of those who failed to decide on either candidate 
dropped from 33 percent to 18 percent in eastern Germany, which 
is 4 percentage points less than in western Germany. 
  We are thus experiencing the very beginnings of distinct 
polarization, albeit with apparently paradoxical consequences, 
i.e. the more the voters drop their reticence and decide on one 
camp or another, the smaller the differences between the 
individual candidates and the political parties become. 
  The number of those who remain unconvinced by any party 
declined from 31 percent to 26 percent and the number of those 
who responded "I don't know" dropped from 9 percent to 7 
percent. At the same time the gap between the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the SPD 
shrunk from 9 percentage points to 6 percentage points. The 
respondents who opted for the CDU/CSU was up from 18 percent to 
23 percent while those opting for the SPD only climbed from 27 
percent to 29 percent. At a generally low level the differences 
even out, i.e. 29 percent for the SPD, 23 percent for the 
CDU/CSU and 26 percent expressing no party preference. The 
campaign thus focuses on the one-third of the electorate who 
opted for none of the political parties or whose response was "I 
don't know." 
  What are the main campaign themes? While it is by no means 
surprising that 65 percent of the voters view unemployment as 
the most serious problem, it is surprising how clearly this 
issue outranks all others in importance. Even the "internal 
security" issue which virtually everyone had assumed could be 
exploited along populist lines ranked behind the environment, 
i.e. seven percent as against 10 percent. Oddly enough, the 
"internal unity" problem came in at just about 5 percent. Even 
among east Germans only 13 percent of the sample considered the 
issue important enough. Could it be that joblessness is the one 
issue which really unites us Germans? 
  The question elicits well-known contradictory responses, 
e.g. 
I am pretty well off but the situation is pretty bad. Of those 
polled 23 percent believe that unemployment will decline over 
the next one or two years, and 45 percent think it will increase 
even more, but east Germans, interestingly enough, are a little 
less pessimistic than west Germans. Nonetheless, 45 percent and 
37 percent respectively believe that their jobs are secure or 
even very secure. On the other hand, 15 percent of the 
jobholding voters think their jobs are "fairly" or "very" 
insecure--and that represents a substantial potential for 
crisis. All in all, however, the voters are much farther ahead 
politically than the parties and organizations think they are. A 
large and in some cases overwhelming majority of the voters 
would be prepared to make sacrifices, if unemployment could be 
brought under control. Seventy-two percent would agree to wage 
cuts; 86 percent would even work on Saturdays; 68 percent would 
work fewer hours for less pay. Low-income voters would be 
prepared to work more while higher earners would agree to less 
income. 
  Maybe this underestimation of the voters is part of the 
reason why they do not think the political parties generally are 
particularly well equipped to bring about a solution to economic 
problems. 31 percent of the respondents expressed "no party 
preference" and as many as 10 percent said "I don't know." 
Against this somber background, with neither party holding a 
real lead any longer, the 28 percent in favor of the CDU/CSU and 
the 26 percent favoring the SPD do not look impressive. What is 
truly sensational and downright alarming for the Free Democrats 
is that a mere 1 percent of the voters feel that this supposedly 
traditional "economics party" has what it takes to deal with the 
economy--which is equal to the percentage obtained by the 
Greens, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), or the 
Republicans. 
  As part of a study commissioned by DIE ZEIT, Infratest 
Burke Berlin took a poll of 1,001 eligible voters. The 
respondents were selected at random. The poll was conducted 
between 14 and 22 March 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Ziller: "Market Forces Guide </F>
Everything--Even Ministers: Currently Guenter Rexrodt's Stock Is 
Not Particularly High With Entrepreneurs and His Own Party 
Colleagues"] 
  [Text] Privatization, less government, liberalization, free 
trade--even on his visit to faraway Cairo Guenter Rexrodt holds 
to these well-known articles of faith, assuring the Egyptian 
journalists who view their own country and the Third World as 
losers of the most recent GATT round that everyone stands to 
gain from the new agreement on world trade. 
  In the luxurious conference room of the Marriott Hotel 
distinctions tend to become blurred. Business school graduate 
Rexrodt offers the same therapy for joblessness in giant export 
nation Germany as for mass unemployment in the developing 
countries: increase productivity, reduce competitive 
disadvantages, conquer new markets. That's all there is to it. 
The way Rexrodt looks at it there are only winners. And yet, the 
prescriptions he offers, sometimes persuasively and sometimes 
didactically, do not impress his Egyptian listeners whose 
experiences tell them otherwise. 
  As far as Rexrodt is concerned, market forces can fix 
anything. And now they are fixing his wagon as well. Powerful 
industrialists are at odds with him. The Free Democrats (FDP), 
the entrepreneurs' party, which was booted out of two regional 
assemblies within the past few months is reacting nervously. 
After the party's debacle in Lower Saxony, honorary party 
chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher complained that Rexrodt is 
running the economy like a lab experiment and called for a 
change of course; for new ideas in place of "entrepreneurial 
populism." 
  For one thing Rexrodt's deregulation campaign against 
discount legislation and binding store closing hours has angered 
the Association of German Retailers (HDE). Hermann Franzen, the 
association's president, has publicly and quite openly 
threatened to get back at the minister. "The retailers and their 
employees should not be put off unnecessarily," he said. "The 
whole thing might just backfire." The Association of 
Medium-Sized and Large Concerns (BAG) is unhappy about the idea 
that customers would bargain at department store registers as if 
they were in a bazaar. 
  The anger of the big shots is primarily directed against 
Rexrodt. Johann Hellwege, the BAG general secretary, says that 
both the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
(CDU/CSU) and the chancellor himself are not to blame. Their 
agreement was obtained on the basis of the (faulty) argument 
that freeing discount competition was part of the united Europe 
code. On this issue the FDP also faces opposition by the 
newspaper publishers and the Federation of Chambers of German 
Industry and Commerce (DIHT). Rexrodt, however, says he will 
stand his ground. "We are doing this on the basis of a 
government decision." The legislation will be passed unless "the 
political parties represented in the Bundestag leave me in the 
lurch." That proviso of Rexrodt's seems to indicate he does not 
feel as sure of himself as he makes out. 
  Rexrodt also is at odds with the gas and electric power 
industries. An amendment to energy legislation would force them 
to open up pipelines and power grids to competition. But the 
electric companies and the communities allied with them want to 
hold on to their profitable "monopoly." That does not augur well 
for Rexrodt and the legislation proposed by him. And as he 
vainly points out that the government promised to introduce more 
competition in the gas and electricity fields in its economic 
report last fall the chancellor's office has said it would 
prefer to let things be. No new fronts are to be opened prior to 
the 16 October Bundestag election. 
  Rexrodt admits that even some members of his own party are 
keeping their distance now that he has picked a fight with some 
sectors of the business community. "Leave well enough alone! 
That is what individual members of the Bundestag caucus are 
saying." Rexrodt refuses to accept their advice because he feels 
it undermines his credibility. After all, the resolutions 
adopted by the FDP party convention call for the very 
initiatives he is trying to implement. He says he is "not 
stupid"; he could see resistance against the "legislation of the 
century" coming. He also knew that the energy legislation would 
not pass during this legislative session. Still, Rexrodt would 
have liked to see the cabinet decide to "get this thing moving, 
for the sake of credibility." 
  He felt that some "good battalions," i.e. small business 
interested in lower energy costs, the processing sector and the 
consumer associations were on his side. "But if you are left out 
in the cold," he says, letting his head hang momentarily. Almost 
instantly, however, the slackness is gone as he consoles himself 
by empasizing that the number of vacillators is limited to just 
"a few individuals." But the question is whether one can really 
refer to Genscher, Irmgard Schwaetzer, the regional planning 
minister, Juergen Moellemann, Rexrodt's predecessor and 
parliamentary party chairman Otto Solms as "just a few 
individuals." 
  The number of his critics and their intentions worry Rexrodt 
a good deal more than he is willing to admit. After all, the 
party decided just a short time ago to feature Rexrodt alongside 
Klaus Kinkel in its publicity campaign leading up to the 
election. Why then did Genscher single Rexrodt out for criticism 
at the meeting of the party presidium following the FDP's 
setback in Lower Saxony? Only because he was not there but at 
the job summit in Detroit? Could it be, his advisers speculate, 
that the critics were not aiming at Rexrodt at all but at the 
party's Number One? 
  Rexrodt says he "was not at all happy" about the fact that 
wide-ranging though the critique was at the time, only the harsh 
words aimed at him reached the public. He feels that the party 
should discuss its problems behind closed doors. Wishing to 
uphold his credibility, he is in no mood to contribute to the 
party's self-destruction. "Otherwise I would act in the very way 
we ought not to act." The only thing is: who is to say that 
success counts for more than honesty in the FDP's struggle for 
survival? 
  Just the same, Rexrodt is not taking Genscher's charge of 
entrepreneurial populism lying down. To be sure, Berlin's former 
finance senator never thought of himself as the champion of the 
lower classes. As soon as he took over his post in Bonn, he let 
it be known that as far as he was concerned the only way to 
overcome the serious economic crisis was to improve production 
conditions for business, to lower wages, and to institute tax 
cuts for high earners and investors. The critique of Rexrodt's 
policies by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) which alternately 
accuses him of "deregulation mania" and of being "on the wrong 
economic policy track" does not faze the self-confidently 
smiling Rexrodt one bit. But the attack from his own camp 
rattles him. Rexrodt thinks of himself as a "minister for the 
business community." But in his view that has nothing to do with 
entrepreneurial populism. 
  He also believes that a large segment of the population 
understands that. "I cannot simply distribute welfare among the 
people," he says. There is not enough money for it. "The people 
expect to be told the truth." And under those circumstances they 
can also be asked to make some sacrifices. 
  Rexrodt does not wish to be a populist but the blond, 
somewhat boyish-looking politician would like to be liked just 
the same. This attitude leads him to make hasty promises--big 
and small. A case in point: he is blithely promising tax cuts to 
high earners and entrepreneurs as early as 1996, although the 
cupboard in Bonn is bare. Rexrodt, who grew up in Thuringia, is 
equally generous on trips to foreign countries, e.g. promising 
Egypt's minister of tourism that he will do his best to work for 
fair and dispassionate coverage of the security situation along 
the Nile. A delicate undertaking in view of the fact that 
terrorists have killed four tourists and threatened additional 
attacks. Under the circumstances Rexrodt has been unable to 
deliver on his promise. 
  That is the minister's principal weakness: a great many 
words 
are followed by few deeds--which is attributable not only to the 
man himself but also to the limitations of his office. His 
ministry can draw up legislation solely on energy policy. Bluem 
is responsible for labor and social policy; Waigel is 
responsible for the treasury; protection of consumers and 
business regulations are part of the Justice Ministry's 
responsibilities. 
  In many instances Rexrodt's role is limited to proposing, 
remembering, urging, and insisting. His penchant for getting 
involved in several issues at a time increases the danger of 
failure. Rexrodt has the right issues, the DIHT says, but is 
unable to do much about them. A genuine "political heavyweight" 
he is not. 
  The main criticism leveled at Rexrodt by industry is that he 
failed to keep the cost-sharing provision for private-nursing 
insurance from passing. But Rexrodt does not accept 
responsibility for that. By the time he joined the cabinet in 
January 1993, he says, all "the bigwigs," including Count 
Lambsdorff, had already agreed to the bill.

<F P=106> [Interview with Constitutional Court President Roman Herzog, </F>
CDU/CSU candidate for federal president, by Gunter Hofmann and 
Robert Leicht; place and date not given: "Toiling in 
Weizsaecker's Footsteps"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Germany is unified as a nation but it is 
still divided internally. What can and should politics 
contribute to the rectification of this condition? 
  [Herzog] Politics in both the old Federal Republic and in 
the 
new laender must have a clear idea of how far unification should 
really go. In terms of the economy, the question is easy to 
answer. As far as this famous overcoming of mental barriers is 
concerned, the aim is, in my opinion, being set too high in the 
discussion of it--at least in the old federal laender. I have 
never shared the view that all Germans have to think alike. I 
regard it to be absurd: It is unhistorical, it is not 
pluralistic, and it is also not democratic. The idea of this 
Wall in the Mind and the dismantling of this Wall I consider to 
be two-thirds west German imperialism. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Was it not also "western imperialism" to 
translate 
this slogan of "Freedom for the east Germans" into "Property for 
the west Germans"--to wit, the property ruling? 
  [Herzog] This is the first issue on which I am not allowed 
to 
comment. That is before my court. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You would, to be sure, like to become federal 
president but expect the public--because of your present 
office--to buy a pig in a poke? 
  [Herzog] In regard to this issue, that is correct. On the 
other hand, it is the Federal Assembly that elects me and I am 
doing everything conceivably possible to explain my convictions 
and my person. There are problems, however, that I cannot 
comment about. 
  [DIE ZEIT] After unification, hardly anyone wanted to open 
the constitutional debate--let alone conduct it aggressively. 
Nonetheless, we talk day after day about aspects of our internal 
and external constitution. The current federal president has 
embarked upon a rather exhaustive criticism of the partisan 
political state. Would not the constitutional debate have 
offered an opportunity to clear up the inadequacies of the 
partisan political state? 
  [Herzog] I do not believe that at all because here we are 
dealing for the most part with things that cannot be regulated 
by law. To be sure, one can stringently regulate--and I want to 
do so and have been calling for it ages--the issue of party 
financing and similar things. One of the faults of our system 
that has resulted in the scandals of recent years is that all of 
that was not regulated. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Not even as a result of the 
by-no-means-consistent 
legal rulings from Karlsruhe...? 
  [Herzog] That too is completely right. But the issue of 
internal party democracy and the issue of limiting the negative 
consequences of internal party democracy that exist as 
well--those are issues that cannot really be regulated by law. 
  [DIE ZEIT] If the political process is to be reformed it 
would have to be reformed against the interests of the parties 
and at the same time with the cooperation of the parties--and 
one cannot have both. How can you prevent parties from 
cooperating, as it were, among themselves? 
  [Herzog] Do you want to do away with the parliamentary 
system 
of government? The parliamentary system of government, which I 
consider to be a very momentous breach of the principle of the 
division of powers, consists of the parliamentary majority 
simultaneously dominating parliament and the government--as a 
result of the majority principle. The attendant consequences can 
only be avoided by introducing a presidential system--something 
I can hardly imagine now. 
  [DIE ZEIT] If it cannot be solved by a presidential system, 
would not the introduction of enhanced plebiscitary elements in 
our constitutional life be a means of overcoming this incestuous 
relationship within and among the parties? 
  [Herzog] There are two things to be distinguished here. One 
is the question of to what extent the parties should really have 
influence on the appointments to leading positions in individual 
areas. In southern Germany the mayors have been elected by the 
people since time immemorial. In Bavaria, even the district 
magistrates are elected by the people. The popular election of 
mayors is now, so to speak, penetrating northward. It has proven 
itself in the south. 
  The second thing is the plebiscitary element. I have always 
said that I am not against it. I come from Bavaria where that 
has been customary for ages. I was a minister in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg where it has existed for ages. I have no 
problem with it. The problem is different. The issue is 
plebiscitary elements and some say Yes and others say No. Yet 
the discussion of it, after all, must take place: What can be 
decided by a plebiscite and what not? This discussion is not 
really being conducted here. 
  [DIE ZEIT] How should we treat the Basic Law as revised 
following unification? Do we need a referendum on the final text? 
  [Herzog] I would welcome the newly formulated constitution 
being submitted to a plebiscite because that is customary in 
democratic nations. 
  [DIE ZEIT] How should this unified nation interpret its 
external role? There are a lot of people now who want to go 
merrily charging into international affairs--to a certain extent 
with military means even. 
  [Herzog] The military question--we have that before us as 
well and therefore I cannot comment on it. Furthermore, the 
whole problem consists of many aspects. The nice little 
pigeonholes have been gone now for some years. The northern 
hemisphere was neatly divided between the Warsaw Pact and NATO 
and the very concept of "Third World" shows that the rest of the 
world was defined in terms of these two pigeonholes--something 
that cannot be true. This is past. I use the following somewhat 
silly example for this: To date, it has been a game of pingpong 
between the East and the West and now it is Rastelli with an 
unlimited number of balls. It is an entirely new way of thinking 
that all of us have not yet mastered. Moreover, there is no 
question at all that in the long run we will not be able to 
shirk the responsibility on the international scene that results 
from this country's importance. And we are not doing that either. 
  [DIE ZEIT] From German history and World War I and II we 
have 
thus far drawn the following conclusion regarding Germany's role 
in Europe: Germany should conduct itself with the greatest 
reserve in international affairs. Now it looks as if many people 
are throwing this practical knowledge overboard. Can we once 
again be completely normal in our foreign policy? 
  [Herzog] No, we cannot. For a long, long time we will have 
to 
make allowances for the sensibilities that we have created in 
our own history. What in the early days of the Federal Republic 
was regarded as a limitation upon our sovereignty and a burden 
became, however, an advantage as it were over the course of the 
intervening 40 years. Although we have every reason to draw our 
conclusions from history, no one will be willing any longer to 
accept in the long run that we, with a reference to our misdeeds 
of the past, claim for ourselves a position that others today 
regard as a privilege. 
  [DIE ZEIT] In reference to East Europe, there is the 
quotation: "That which we did not gain in war will fall into our 
lap in peacetime." 
  [Herzog] That must not be allowed to become policy. Even the 
appearance of it must not arise. That is, moreover, the 
reason--and I am permitted to state it now that it has been 
ruled on--why in the final analysis I was also for the 
Maastricht Treaty. 
  [DIE ZEIT] After unification there has been a growing chorus 
of voices claiming that we no longer need our close ties to the 
West, that our linkage to the West was a special course and now 
we can go our own way. 
  [Herzog] That is sheer nonsense: We cannot. He who leans far 
out of the window--and we have to do that in East Europe--must 
ensure that there is someone there holding onto him--that is our 
integration into the West--so that he does not fall out of the 
window. And finally: Who knows, to put it this way, what the 
national character of our own people will once again bestow upon 
us? 
  [DIE ZEIT] If the future Berlin Republic therefore has to be 
in essence a continuation of the Bonn Republic, what is the 
situation with the catchword "constitutional patriotism?" Dolf 
Sternberger characterized the concept by stating that the 
republican rules of the constitution are the core of our 
society, and thus it is sufficiently defined. More and more it 
is now being said that a purely republican constitution is not 
sufficient, that we need in addition a national consciousness. 
  [Herzog] Because of everything in my entire background, my 
sense of national pride and such things is downright 
underdeveloped. I love the German people, who are a difficult 
people, but I really love them in all their branches--and I do 
not say that just since I have become a candidate for the office 
of federal president. But one has to proceed with caution in 
these things. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The sociologist Lepsius once said: "We simply 
cannot identify with Germany's history...National Socialism has 
made this absolutely impossible." 
  [Herzog] I think that we are dealing only with a difference 
in wording here. The word "nation state" is, after all, an 
archaic word. The phenomenon of the nation state in the form in 
which it used to exist is a thing of the past. Basically, it was 
already relegated to being put in quotation marks by the entry 
into the world economy, and then it was really put in quotation 
marks by West European integration and it has been basically 
antiquated. But nonetheless the peoples of Europe live in states 
that constitute their nations. And they want their states. No 
Frenchman would ever be prepared to give up France just for 
Europe. It is exactly the same with us. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Steffen Heitmann once said that the identity of 
the country must be culturally defined. 
  [Herzog] Now here again I can do relatively little with that 
because already during the time of the classic nation state I 
considered culture to be something that transcends nations. In 
addition--and I would really like to emphasize this once 
again--culture was always international or predominately 
international. 
  [DIE ZEIT] When the RAF [Red Army Faction] was terrorizing 
this country, society--the state--was prepared to undertake the 
most extreme measures. Is it unfair to say that this society did 
not act so decisively against the Right? 
  [Herzog] There was a phase of perplexity, of 
irritation--that 
is entirely correct. I no longer see this, however. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Konrad Adenauer was extremely suspicious 
regarding 
the Germans' democratic loyalties in general. 
  [Herzog] Yes, we have to be on guard. To be sure, I go on 
the 
assumption that the great majority today is at heart faithful to 
democracy, yet the times are past when the ultraleftist and 
ultrarightist groupings, which exist in any nation, were 
quiescent. For more than a generation they were disqualified by 
Stalinism and National Socialism. That, of course, has changed 
with the expiration and succession of generations. For that 
reason I have always said: Pay attention to these people, do not 
let them drift away. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The Federal Republic has always lived in the 
shadow of the past. Now we are living in the shadow of a double 
past. What should we learn from the years after 1945 for our 
dealing with the dictatorship in East Germany and its legacy in 
the form of the Stasi [State Security Service] files? Should we 
make amends there for what we failed to do in 1945, or did we 
learn after 1945 what must not be neglected in coming to terms 
with the past? 
  [Herzog] I believe the latter. One thing must be clear: 
Flagrant violations of human rights, the killing of people, 
arbitrary incarceration of people, torture and the like must be 
exposed and must be documented--as has been done in the final 
analysis in the case of the Third Reich as well, albeit with 
large delay factors. 
  [DIE ZEIT] But mean-spirited denunciation, spying on people, 
snooping around? 
  [Herzog] I would make considerable distinctions in regard to 
what happened. It is a different matter in cases where people 
were really harmed than it is if someone submitted a report 
about a trip to the Federal Republic or to France. The 
"arrangements" that someone made with this regime over 40 
years--that is, after all, something known from the period after 
1945 as well--you cannot pursue either politically or through 
the criminal law. 
  [DIE ZEIT] But you are not advocating a "sealing of the 
files" either, are you? 
  [Herzog] I, too, do not advocate sealing the files for a 
very 
simple practical reason: Sooner or later it will come to light 
after all. 
  [DIE ZEIT] We have a year ahead of us in which the 
anniversaries will pile up and one has the impression that, like 
1984-85, we are once again stumbling somewhat clumsily into the 
situation. Should we be present [at the commemorative 
ceremonies] on the Atlantic coast? 
  [Herzog] It depends upon the nature of such ceremonies. We 
should, I believe, have nothing to do with those that basically 
celebrate victory over the Germans. It is proper that we are not 
being invited and, in my opinion, it is also proper that Helmut 
Kohl says he would not go there at all. When it comes to 
ceremonies that point to the future from the perspective of that 
time--that say that was the beginning of a new European 
policy--then the matter is entirely different. But in all these 
things I would be very much opposed to a 
we-have-to-participate-in-everything mentality as well as 
opposed to a mentality that feels itself disqualified when the 
others celebrate their victory. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Are we at least able today to acknowledge that 
the 
military defeat of the German Reich was the sole prospect of 
achieving a free Germany and a free Europe? 
  [Herzog] I do not have the impression that that is disputed 
in our country. If you direct the question to me--it is to be 
answered in the affirmative. It is my view that we should be 
able to see that and not to worry further about it at all. 
  [DIE ZEIT] All federal presidents to date have suffered from 
the fetters of the office and occasionally have tried to tug on 
the chains. What attracts you to this basically weak office? 
  [Herzog] What interests me about the office are two things. 
The first is: We have a pluralistic society and it is proper 
that we do. I feel comfortable in it. The only thing is that a 
pluralistic society naturally develops centrifugal forces, yet 
it only functions when the sum of the centripetal forces is at 
least equally great as--if not somewhat greater than--that of 
the centrifugal ones. And there are, after all, many 
communalities among our political camps, but they, in fact, get 
lost in the business of politics. What actually emerges all the 
time are only those things that divide them, not those that 
unite them. 
  [DIE ZEIT] That means that you, as president, would be the 
personification of the "Round Table." 
  [Herzog] No, but to that end one must look around and see 
where there are integrative agencies. And my opinion on that 
score has always been that one is the federal president and 
another is the Federal Constitutional Court--in different areas 
and with entirely different methods. The other thing is that I 
have the feeling that the parties, to a certain extent for 
easily explainable reasons--and that is not just their failure 
but that is a part of the system--also have to deal a lot in 
these political discussions with details, and that the citizens 
see the larger problems and therefore feel to a great extent 
that they are not being understood. 
  [DIE ZEIT] That means that the federal president would then 
on occasion be the spokesman for the citizenry to the parties as 
a whole? 
  [Herzog] Yes, publicly. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You are thereby attributing a compensatory 
function to the federal president. He would jump in... 
  [Herzog] That is not incorrect. But it is not just the job 
of 
the federal president to act as a counterweight, rather it 
belongs to those people who ought to do it. 
  [DIE ZEIT] That means now and then taking the parties to 
task 
then? 
  [Herzog] Yes. Only it is a question of whether to do it 
publicly. That has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Did not Richard von Weizsaecker's administration 
raise expectations for this office much higher than the office 
can in fact live up to? 
  [Herzog] Yes. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Will not then a period of normalization set in 
following Richard von Weizsaecker's administration? 
  [Herzog] I would not say normalization, but it is very clear 
that it will be terribly difficult to toil in the man's 
footsteps. That, however, will apply for anyone who assumes the 
office. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Herzog, the liberals in this country say that 
Roman Herzog is not nearly as conservative as a Christian 
Democratic Union (CDU) candidate could be. Many CDU supporters, 
even in the conservative press, say that Roman Herzog is not as 
conservative as he should be. In that quarter you are considered 
to be ideologically a bit unreliable. How liberal are you? How 
conservative are you? 
  [Herzog] That is the old story, and once again I have to 
say: 
Pigeonholes do not do any good. 
  [DIE ZEIT] In general, what does this society as it is 
presently constituted need more: a bit more liberality or a bit 
more conservativeness? 
  [Herzog] Now you would have to hold a long discussion as to 
what is liberal and what is conservative. I believe in any case 
that solutions can only be found in free discussion. On that 
score I am an almost childlike liberal: I still believe in the 
freedom of discussion.
