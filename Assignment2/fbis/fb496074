  [Text] Abu Dhabi--Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Ahmad al-Mu'alla, the 
planning minister in the United Arab Emirates [UAE], said that 
the economy of the UAE grew at the rate of 2.4 percent in 1994 
compared to 1993. 
  He said that the UAE was able to cope with the crisis caused 
by the drop in oil prices in 1993 because of its strong economy, 
which enabled it to absorb the shocks of the crisis and to adapt 
to changes in the world oil market. 
  He stressed that 1993 will have seen a budget surplus, 
similar to that achieved in 1992, due to a drop in allocations 
for security, continued spending control, and an increase in 
government sources. 
  The Planning Ministry said yesterday in press statements 
that 
the 1993 budget will achieve a surplus due to a drop in security 
expenditures following the end of the Gulf war, continued 
spending control, the combatting of waste, and the speed with 
which efforts were made to renew and increase governmental 
sources. 
  The expected budget deficit for 1993 of 1.7 billion dirham 
[UD] failed to materialize, because state expenditures were less 
than the approximately UD17.6 billion estimated in the 1993 
budget, and less than state revenues, which totaled UD15.9 
billion. 
  Financial sources expect this situation to continue in 1994, 
when expenditures and revenues are expected to total about $17.6 
billion and $16.3 billion respectively. 
  The government stresses, in the 1994 draft budget announced 
last week, that the deficit fell by about UD1.3 billion, and 
that the ministries' revenues from fees increased by UD500 
million. 
  The approximately UD1.3 billion 1994 estimated budget 
deficit 
will also be imaginary. The 1994 budget is also expected to 
realize a surplus, because the allocations provided in it are 
not all expected to be implemented. Unspent allocations 
generally pertain to investment projects that are not 
implemented at the designated time. 
  The planning minister stressed that the UAE's economy will 
experience a discernible recovery, and that the expansion that 
began in 1992/1993 will continue in 1994 due to: the 
government's promotion of new investments in different areas; 
tangible development in private-sector activity, especially 
production activity; and the trend toward regional stability. 
  The region is expected to see extensive trading activity in 
which the UAE is expected to play a key role based on the 
commercial and financial position it enjoys. 
  He said, "These expectations are based on the continued 
remediation of the economic problems that have faced the UAE. 
This remediation has resulted in a surplus in the general 
budget, the development of the non-oil sectors in the economy, 
the achievement of greater cooperation with the countries of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council, the encouragement of investment 
between the Gulf countries, the establishment of a securities 
market, the establishment of unified customs, and the opening of 
Gulf markets to each other, which will help achieve positive 
growth." 
  He added that expectations of growth in the UAE are also 
based on: the ability of the UAE's economy to absorb the effect 
of the drop in oil prices; the UAE's joining of the GATT 
agreement that will begin to be implemented in 1995; and the 
achievement of greater cooperation with Gulf, Arab, and 
developing countries. 
  He stressed that the UAE made a number of economic decisions 
this year that have enabled it to cope with and surmount many 
circumstances and to generate balanced development. 
  He said, "The UAE saw a tangible improvement in 1993. It 
began to move beyond the effects of the Gulf crisis." He pointed 
to a clear improvement in the gross product, current surplus, 
and balance of payments, and to an increase in total fixed 
capital formation. He said, "Many factors have helped improve 
performance, including the recovery in the non-oil sectors, the 
realization of a surplus in the general budget, and a drop in 
the volume of transfers abroad, which had the greatest effect on 
the balance of payments." 
  Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Ahmad al-Mu'alla stressed that the 
government of the UAE was able in 1993 to overcome the obstacles 
in its path, the most salient being the budget deficit that had 
emerged in previous years. Due to the government's efforts, he 
added, a surplus was realized in the 1992 budget. He expects 
this surplus to continue in 1993 based on the emergence of 
encouraging factors, e.g., a reduction in defense spending, 
continued spending control, and an increase in government 
sources.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi--The UAE's [United Arab Emirate] crude oil 
revenues in 1993 dropped by 1.766 billion dirhams [UD] (about 
$600 million) to UD51.350 billion ($13.99 billion) relative to 
its crude oil revenues in 1992, which totaled UD53.116 billion 
($14.5 billion). This drop is attributed to the decline in crude 
oil prices that occurred in the second half of 1993. 
  The UAE's crude oil revenues in 1993 constituted 39 percent 
of its gross product, which totaled about UD131.6 billion. 
  The Planning Ministry, in preliminary estimates published 
yesterday on economic developments in the UAE in 1993, stressed 
that the decline in oil revenues was accompanied by an increase 
in the non-oil sectors' share of gross product, which totaled 
UD80.310 billion ($21.88 billion), compared to UD77.047 billion 
($20.99 billion) in 1992. 
  Most of the oil revenues in the UAE go to the Emirate of Abu 
Dhabi. 
  According to 1992 estimates, the oil sector in each of the 
emirates contributed the following to the UAE's domestic 
product: Abu Dhabi, UD43.541 billion; Dubai, UD8.394 billion; 
al-Shariqah, UD10.061 billion; Ra's al-Khaymah, UD120 million. 
  Of all of the emirates, Abu Dhabi's oil output contributes 
the most to the GDP. The Planning Ministry states that Abu 
Dhabi's gross product rose to UD81.692 billion in 1993, compared 
to UD80.979 billion in 1992 and UD79.9 billion in 1991, despite 
the drop in oil prices. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of Dubai rose to UD31.200 
billion in 1993, compared to UD30.729 billion in 1992 and 
UD28.967 billion in 1991. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of al-Shariqah rose to 
UD10.322 billion in 1993, compared to UD10.194 billion in 1992 
and UD9.616 billion in 1991. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of 'Ajman rose to UD1.602 
billion in 1993, compared to UD1.562 billion in 1992 and UD1.489 
billion in 1991. The gross product of the Emirate of Umm 
al-Qaywayn rose to UD873 million in 1993, compared to UD852 
million in 1992 and UD800 million in 1991. 
  The gross product of the Emirate of Ra's al-Khaymah rose to 
UD3.941 billion in 1993, compared to UD3.860 billion in 1992 and 
UD3.655 billion in 1991. The gross product of the Emirate of 
al-Fujayrah rose to UD2.030 billion in 1992, compared to UD1.987 
billion and UD1.788 billion during 1992 and 1991 respectively. 
  The UAE's GDP in 1993 rose to UD131.660 billion, compared to 
UD130.163 billion in 1992. 
  The UAE Planning Ministry stated that the different 
production sectors recorded varying degrees of development. The 
most salient development was the drop in the value of the output 
of the extraction (crude oil) industries to UD51.350 billion in 
1993, compared to UD53.116 billion in 1992. However, the value 
of the output of the other extraction industries rose to UD369 
million, compared to UD355 million in 1992. 
  The share of manufacturing industries rose to UD10.891 
billion, compared to UD9.942 billion in 1992. During the same 
period, the share of the electricity and water sector rose from 
UD2.869 billion to UD2.961 billion; that of the building and 
construction sector rose from UD11.125 to UD11.582 billion; that 
of the wholesale and retail trade and hotel sector rose from 
UD13.020 billion to UD13.382 billion; and that of the transport, 
storage, and communications sector rose from UD7.167 billion to 
UD7.390 billion.

  [Text] Economics Division. During the eight years of the 
sacred defense, despite serious damage, our nation's industries 
were the greatest support for our nation's sacred defense 
against oppression and aggression. 
  Great efforts were made at the beginning of the First 
Five-Year Plan to make use of unused capacities after 
reconstruction. 
  Some people believed that development of the country without 
industrial development was impossible. 
  In any case, after reconstruction our nation's industries 
are 
striving, as they reach their ultimate production capacity, to 
find a place for themselves in the international market. 
  To discuss the nature of the nation's industrial situation, 
we spoke with Engineer Mohammad Reza Ne'matzadeh, minister of 
industries, and we devote today's page to the economic 
achievements of the Islamic revolution. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is the Ministry of Industry's area 
of responsibility since the triumph of the Islamic revolution? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] Before the triumph of the Islamic revolution a 
ministry called Industries and Mines had the responsibility of 
managing the nation's industries and mines. After the triumph of 
the Islamic revolution, in the year 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 
1982] a part of this ministry became the Ministry of Mines and 
Metals, which took on the responsibility of managing basic mines 
and metals. About a year later a part of this ministry became 
the Ministry of Heavy Industries, which took on the tasks of 
vehicle manufacture, machinery manufacture, and foundry 
operations. 
  What was left of this ministry continued to operate as the 
Ministry of Industries, which covered 80 percent of the 
producing units and 75 percent of the nation's added value and 
industrial employment. It now serves the Islamic nation with 
electrical and electronic industries, foods and drugs, chemicals 
and cellulose, textiles and leather, nonmetallic minerals, and 
light metals as its areas of oversight. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Was the separation of these ministries 
successful in practice? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] Conditions at that time required that such a 
division take place, because the flight of the owners of 
industries and the stagnation of the industrial sector demanded 
that the government take over the management of industries. 
During the war investors were not willing to get involved in the 
production sector and produce basic needs. Thus it was quite 
necessary for the government to take over management of the 
nation's affairs, including industries. 
  In my view this was a natural decision, which took place 
over 
a period of time. Now that conditions have returned to normal, 
it would be better to consolidate these organizations to make 
better use of them. 
  Because the policies of privatization esepcially must not be 
carried out in haste, along with the transfer of producing 
units, it is also better gradually to reconsolidate, because the 
government wants to do the work of supervision, planning, and 
guidance. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What effect did the war have on the 
nation's light industries? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] Under this ministry industries were divided 
into two sectors, the ones that produce basic and necessary 
goods, and the ones that do not. During the war the first sector 
continued to operate, and it sometimes even expanded with the 
production of needed goods. However, because of the imposed 
war it was not possible to reform their economic structure. 
Because of shortages the second sector reduced production, its 
unused capacities increased and it was not able to develop. Of 
course during the First Five-Year Plan we were unable to make 
use of these capacities and develop them to some extent. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Does this mean that the war had a 
negative effect on industry? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] In my view, considering the fact that we were 
unable to depend on ourselves and move in the direction of 
creativity and prosperity, the war was a blessing, just as His 
Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him) said. 
  From an economic standpoint, however, because of the 
stagnation and failure of the economy to move, our industrial 
and investment foundations have become weak. Therefore, because 
of the limitations and implementation of the controls of that 
time, to some extent work initiative was lost. Even so, I 
think that a comparison with wartime and nonwartime conditions 
with regard to industry is not a fair comparison, because in two 
separate periods two separate policies were in effect. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What policy was used for postwar 
industrial reconstruction? 
  Was the reconstruction done in the traditional way, or was 
it 
done along with modernization and development? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] The necessary changes were made in most of the 
required situations. Sometimes development also took place along 
with the reconstruction. In most cases even structural reform 
took place. In some cases, however, it was necessary to complete 
the reconstruction in two phases. 
  At the Khorramshahr Soap Factory, development and 
modernization was done along with the reconstruction. 
  Of course, I must add that until the first year of the First 
Five-Year Plan, in a 12-year period amortization was proceeding 
at twice the rate of new investments. In other words, our 
industries are wearing out rapidly. 
  Along with the new investments, we set out to rebuild 
producing units. Perhaps our oldest industries are in the food 
and textile sectors. Of course, some of them are also in the 
cement sector. Fortunately, reconstruction has taken place in 
more than 100 units. However, we still have many units in the 
textiles sector that are completely worn out. To replace them we 
activated the Ghadir Machine Manufacturing Plant to build 50 
spinning machines and 1,400 weaving machines. Unfortunately, 
despite the payment of foreign exchange to this unit, which is 
under the mantle of the Ministry of Heavy Industries, its 
performance has been unsuccessful and there have been many 
delays in the delivery of the machines. We hope that the 
reconstruction in the textiles sector will be done as quickly as 
possible with the delivery of these machines. 
  There has also been good reconstruction and capacity 
creation 
in the cement industries. In the sugar cube factories, which are 
in excess of 35 units, we had eight inoperative units at the 
time of the beginning of the Five-Year Plan. Today seven of 
those units are back in the production circuit, and the eighth 
one, which is 50 years old, is being rebuilt. In view of the 
fact that no sugar cube factories have been built since the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution despite the increase in the 
production of sugar beets, this year we had the greatest use of 
the beets and we set a record for sugar cube production. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What was the nature of the performance 
of 
the Ministry of Industries under the First Five-Year Plan? Did 
you reach the goals in the plan or not? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] The best judge of this is the people 
themselves, who can judge the performance of the Ministry of 
Industries. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Even so, I wish to note that it is the 
performance of industry that must be evaluated, not that of the 
officials. Thus what has been achieved is the result of the 
labors of industrialists and the nation's hard-working laborers. 
  [Ne'matzadeh] Before I paint a picture of these performances 
in the framework of statistics and figures, I must discuss the 
policies, which are among the government's main 
responsibilities, and have to do with this ministry in the 
industrial sector. 
  First of all, the obstacles in the path of industry, such as 
limitations on the issuance of agreements in principle, on 
capital investment, and production, which were removed over a 
period of six months. In other words, it may be said that we 
freed industry from excessive regulation, and the prerogatives 
were turned over to the provinces so the decision making would 
be decentralized. 
  A system for supervision and inspection was established with 
the collection of reports from the units. The statistics system 
was reinforced, first-hand inspections were conducted, model 
units were selected, and model exporters were selected from 
among the 25,000 existing units, which was a very good 
experience. 
  Other achievements by the Ministry of Industries to improve 
industry included the creation of sound competition and the 
establishment of a policy to break up monopolies. 
  The ministry also encouraged the formation of specialist 
organizations and encouraged the nation's economic and monetary 
system and also the banks to invest in the industrial sector, 
which brought a good return despite the limitations. 
  The ministry created encouragement mechanisms to develop 
industries in the deprived areas and it also established 
privileges in foreign exchange and construction materials and 
encouraged educational and research activities, whose 
manifestation can be seen in the producing units. 
  The deregulation of prices was another important step for 
industrial development. It was in the framework of the above 
policies that the following statistical results were achieved. 
  The growth in added value for four years in the industries 
under this ministry was 10.5 percent, while this figure was 
projected at 6.5 percent in the Five-Year Plan. We hope that by 
the end of the Five-Year Plan (the five-year performance) this 
figure will reach 8.5 percent. The projected figure in the 
Five-Year Plan is 7.5 percent. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] It appears that the growth in added 
value 
began with good speed and then dropped sharply. What is the 
reason? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] The reason for the initial jump was the 
abundant initial effort to fill the nation's gap in the 
production of industrial goods, which was made based on the 
stagnation and the war. 
  Of course it was also the government's view that in the 
first 
years of the Five-Year Plan we should have more activity than 
the final years in order to get results more quickly. 
  For example, in the first years of the Five-Year Plan many 
of 
the slow development projects were in cement and construction 
materials. However, we were forced to expedite production of 
construction materials. 
  Many of the goods on the black market were very expensive 
due 
to their short supply, and the differences between the costs of 
production and consumption were very high. On this basis, we had 
to increase supply to fill this gap. 
  In any case the 8.5 percent growth was the result of 
increased industrial production. For example, during recent 
years 3.5 million tons of sugar cubes and sugar was produced. In 
the year 1367 [21 March 1988 - 20 March 1989] the year's 
production of sugar cubes and sugar was 640,000 tons. Last year 
we reached the figure of 830,000 tons, which is the nation's 
highest record. 
  During the last four years in the country about 2.6 million 
tons of vegetable shortening was produced and refined. In the 
year 1367 [21 March 1988 - 20 March 1989] the figure was 357,000 
tons. Last year this figure reached 608,000 tons, and this again 
was a national record. We hope to reach a higher figure this 
year. 
  With regard to cement, in the year 1367 [21 March 1988 - 20 
March 1989] we produced 12.2 million tons. Last year this figure 
reached 15.1 million tons, and we hope it will reach 16 million 
tons this year. 
  In the household necessities sector, in the year 1367 [21 
March 1988 -20 March 1989] about 50 [as published] color 
televisions were produced. Last year this figure reached 
250,000. In the year 1367 275,000 refrigerators and freezers 
were produced, and in the year 1371 [21 March 1992 - 20 March 
1993] this figure reached 850,000. 
  In the area of paper and cardboard, in the year 1367 [21 
March 1988 - 20 March 1989] production was 93,000 tons. Last 
year this figure reached 172,000 tons, and we hope it will be 
more this year. Of course more than 2,000 kinds of goods are 
produced under the mantle of the Ministry of Industries, of 
which I have mentioned only a few examples. 
  In general, we have had increased production in all areas. 
For example, in the pharmaceutical industries sector, which is 
one of society's basic goods, in the year 1367 [21 March 1988 - 
20 March 1989] a total of 8.8 billion drug items were produced. 
This figure reached 12 billion last year, and in the current 
year, despite the foreign exchange limitations, in the first 
nine months of the year [21 March - 21 December 1993] we have 
produced the same amount as the year 1367. About 90 percent of 
the drugs consumed in the country are produced domestically. 
  We have had good creation of capacity and if the investment 
limitations were removed, we could increase production to a 
level higher than the nation's consumption. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] The statistics on the production of 
pharmaceuticals are quite hopeful, but unfortunately in society 
one continues to see drug shortages. How can this be explained? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] Policy-making on drug production is the 
responsibility of the Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and 
Medical Education, and the industrial sector follows their 
policies. 
  In my view one of the problems may be that the constituent 
elements of drug production are not correct, meaning that 
production is high for some items and insufficient for others. 
Another point is that late last year due to foreign exchange 
limitations, production was limited for items whose foreign 
exchange consumption is high. In recent months efforts have been 
made to alleviate these shortages. 
  Another issue is the exit of drugs from the country, which 
almost everyone acknowledges. Another point may be wasteful 
consumption. Today unused drugs are seen in most homes. In any 
case, we do not make policy on drug production. Industry 
produces in accordance with the plan it receives. 
  Perhaps if the production of drugs was also the 
responsibility of the Ministry of Industries, its problems would 
be reduced as they have been in the other sectors. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In general you have described the 
Five-Year Plan in the industrial sector as being successful. Was 
there an isolated sector that did not reach its goals? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] As I said, we have reached the general goals 
of 
the Five-Year Plan. Only in the cement sector, despite increased 
production, did we fail to reach the enacted figure of 18 
million tons per year. This year the nation's cement production 
will reach 16 million tons. 
  I must note that the initial operational projections for 
several new projects were made based on full capacity, and these 
projects did not respond according to schedule. We hope in the 
coming years to see another jump in the nation's cement 
production. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is the situation in the country 
with 
regard to industrial exports? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] In my view the industrial foundations have 
been 
built. The research sector has been established as a specialty 
and quality has found its place in the buyer countries. Today 
industries are struggling for sound competition, an unobstructed 
path and abundant supply and demand. Under such circumstances, 
our export situation is as follows: 
  In the year 1367 [21 March 1988 - 20 March 1989] the exports 
for the industries under this ministry were more than $70 
million. Last year this figure exceeded $400 million, which is 
good growth. This year also, despite the drop in average 
industrial production compared to last year due to the foreign 
exchange rate, we hope to have exports that exceed last year's. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your view of the quality of the 
goods produced? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] The quality of goods, due to sound 
competition, 
has increased greatly, and the statistics from the Standards 
Institute show that at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan 
we had about 350 items with the standard seal, and today more 
than 1,250 units were unable to get the standard seal. 
  In addition to today's compulsory standards, the production 
units want industry with quality. 
  For example, concerning the production of men's shirts, I 
must say that one of our successful units was able to win first 
place among 260 world-famous brands on the European market 
(Jamegan Shirts). Likewise, in the foodstuffs sector we were 
able to win several international prizes. These things show that 
the atmosphere is suitable for production, the nation's industry 
is capable of marketing its capabilities internationally. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Have you been successful with 
investment, 
acquiring credits and creating employment? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] With the deregulation of the issuance of 
agreements in principle, more than 35,000 agreements in 
principle were issued during the First Five-Year Plan, and a 
number of them have also produced results. Today the issuance of 
agreements in principle has become routine and it is purely an 
economic matter. In the area of employment, in the last four 
years more than 160,000 jobs have been created in the industrial 
sector. 
  Likewise, the total amount of foreign exchange obtained is 
about $2 billion. In view of the fact that our priority is 
intermediate and basic industries, about 75 percent of this 
foreign exchange was obtained in these sectors. 
  We also obtained about $2 billion in foreign exchange 
credits 
(financing), of course with Majles approval. These credits 
created good capability in the industrial sector to enable us to 
meet our needs. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] The agricultural conversion industries 
are another shortcoming in the industrial sector. What measures 
have you taken in this area? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] The forgotten agricultural conversion 
industries sector is receiving special attention today. Credits 
have been obtained for about 30 cheese production units, and 
their machinery is ready. We hope to put them into operation at 
the beginning of next year. Today there is an investor seeking 
to build flour factories, while at one time no one was willing 
to build them. Effective steps have been taken for the packaging 
of fruits and fresh vegetables. More than 50 refrigeration 
facilities have been put into operation in the country. 
Attention has been given to units producing plant protein and 
there has been good activity in the production of fruit juice 
and fruit concentrate. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is the outlook for industry under 
the Second Five-Year Plan? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] We have semi-complete projects, and we hope 
with their completion to complete the chain of production to 
exports and to make the nation's capabilities even greater. 
  Likewise, under the Second Five-Year Plan we must have total 
added value of 6.5 percent, which will be distributed among the 
various sectors. 
  We have projected growth in utilization of five percent per 
year, which will make industries more economical. Exports will 
grow 15 percent during the Second Five-Year Plan. In general, 
under the Second Five-Year Plan quality will have priority. Of 
course quantity is also a basic consideration. 
  On the one hand, during the Second Five-Year Plan we will 
increase the government's policy-making ability, and with 
encouragement programs, we will continue to turn the work over 
to the people.

  [Text] Economics Division. The transportation and shipping 
network, the construction of connective roads in the country and 
the shortfalls and achievements in these areas is the topic of 
this installment of "A Look at the Achievements of the Islamic 
Revolution," which is an interview with the minister of roads 
and transport [Akbat Torkan]. 
  Engineer Torkan began by discussing the responsibilities of 
the Ministry of Roads and Transport. He said: This ministry's 
responsibility is the shipping and transportation of goods and 
passengers, which is done by land, sea, and air. The building of 
infrastructure and investment in infrastructure affairs is 
really done to create transportation and shipping. We continue 
this interview below. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your assessment of the success 
of 
the officials of the Ministry of Roads and Transport in 
fulfilling these responsibilities? 
  [Torkan] My assessment includes the performance of this 
ministry's former officials, such as Martyr Kalantari, Dr. 
Nezhadhoseynian, and Engineer Sa'idi-Kiya, whose performance was 
completely positive. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In the First Five-Year Plan, did the 
Ministry of Roads and Transport reach its goals? 
  [Torkan] Transportation depends on the nation's economy. The 
more the gross domestic product increases, the more 
transportation increases. The more a nation develops its 
exports, the more its transportation increases. These things are 
connected together like a chain. In my view, the Ministry of 
Roads and Transport developed successfully during the First 
Five-Year Plan. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your detailed assessment of this 
success? 
  [Torkan] The most important thing I must mention with regard 
to transportation is that its goals and strategies change under 
the influence of environmental conditions. When you talk about 
transportation and shipping in Iran in the year 1367 [21 March 
1988-20 March 1989], we had need and demand for transportation. 
When we talk about transportation and shipping in the year 1370 
[21 March 1991-20 March 1992] when the Central Asian nations are 
liberated and have set out to enter international markets, wish 
to trade with the world and have gotten past their dead end, 
then there is new demand for transportation and shipping, and 
following that, based on estimated demand, planning goals are 
being set for transportation and shipping. 
  With the independence of the Central Asian nations and their 
membership in the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization], this 
organization has 10 members instead of just its former three 
members, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, so that Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, and five Central Asian nations have joined this 
organization. Because these nations have high potential in terms 
of transportation and shipping and wish to connect with 
international markets, and the world also wishes to trade with 
these nations, it appears that the path for travel and 
transportation and shipping to these countries will be the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  On the other hand, before the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 
March 1990] the idea of transportation and shipping on the Sea 
of Mazandaran had no meaning and was very limited. From this 
year on, however, the idea became quite meaningful and underwent 
development. Consequently, we are now building new ports on the 
Sea of Mazandaran. 
  The idea of building new ports in Faridunkenar and Amirabad, 
of developing the ports of Anzali and Bandar-e Nowshahr and 
reviving Bandar-e Torkman and Bandar-e Gaz was a goal that was 
raised in the Ministry of Roads and Transport after these 
nations in Central Asia became independent, and this ministry 
has made plans for these ports. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Were these short goals? That is, were 
they limited to the First Five-Year Plan? 
  [Torkan] These programs were added in the middle of the 
First 
Five-Year Plan. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then by this reckoning, the goals of the 
Ministry of Roads and Transport changed during the First 
Five-Year Plan. In view of these changes, were you able to make 
use of existing potentials in such a way as to reach the above 
goals? 
  [Torkan] Of course, in general I must say that the answer is 
affirmative. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Could you please discuss what you did in 
detail? 
  [Torkan] We have four border cities with Turkmenistan, the 
cities of Sarakhs, Lotfabad, Bajgiran, and Pol. After the 
Central Asian nations became independent these border points 
were opened. It likewise became necessary to develop the border 
at Astara, and consequently roads were built and improved to 
gain access to these borders. The roads between Mashhad-Sarakhs, 
Emamqoli-Quchan, and Emamqoli-Darrehgaz are examples of the 
projects that connect us to the Lotfabad border. They have now 
been completed and traffic is traveling on them. 
  There is also the Bajgiran-Emamqoli road that is now under 
construction and is more than 50-percent complete. 
  The construction of the Mashhad-Sarakhs railroad was really 
proposed after the independence of the Central Asian nations. It 
is now under construction and we hope this railroad will be 
complete by the end of the year 1374 [20 March 1976]. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Have we had as much road development as 
this in the rest of the country? 
  [Torkan] These roads that were mentioned are the ones that 
connect us to Central Asia. In other parts of the country, 
during the time of Engineer Sa'idi-Kiya a total of 20,000 km of 
roads was built over a period of eight years, and this figure is 
quite significant. 
  Also during the tenure of Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya, the Bafq-Bandar 
'Abbas railroad was put into operation up to the Tazraj station, 
190 km from Bandar 'Abbas. We are continuing to work along the 
route from Tazraj to Bandar 'Abbas, and we hope that this 
railroad will go into operation in the second half of the year 
1373 [23 September 1994-20 March 1995]. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] We have connected the roads in Central 
Asia and the Caucasus to the roads in our country via the border 
points you mentioned. Along with that, have we also been able to 
develop the nation's other roads? 
  [Torkan] In the process of continuing these same transit 
roads, one task is connecting Mashhad to the southern shores. 
Our main road now goes from Mashhad to Torbat-e Heydariyeh, from 
there to Birjand and then to Zahedan and Iranshahr and 
Chahbahar, and this road has very high quality in terms of 
transit. 
  Another road that was completed this year, which we hope to 
put into operation during the 10 Days of Dawn celebration, is a 
road called Dihuk-Ravar, with which it will no longer be 
necessary for you to go from Tabas to Na'in and Yazd. You will 
be able to go from Tabas to Dihuk, and from there to Ravar, and 
then to Kerman, and then finally to Bandar 'Abbas, and this road 
has been presented in ECO as one of our transit roads. 
  It is necessary to explain that another valuable task that 
was accomplished in the time of Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya is the part of 
the road from Yazd to Tabas. Of course, Yazd is now connected to 
Tabas, but this road goes through the middle of the desert. 
  Another road that exists that has not yet been completed and 
is under construction is one of our very important desert roads 
called Jandaq-Mo'aleman, which really finally connects Semnan 
and Damghan to Na'in, on which you can cross Iran's central 
plain on an asphalt road. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Despite the development of the roads you 
mentioned, it still appears that we have a shortage of 
connective roads in the country. Have you estimated this 
shortage at all? 
  [Torkan] These shortages will always exist because we need 
to 
develop roads everywhere in the country. However, under these 
conditions one must observe priorities. We need 355 billion 
tomans to complete the roads now under construction, meaning the 
roads that have been given to the contractors, while in the 
Second Five-Year Plan we have 155 billion tomans credit for road 
construction. We are now at a place where a decision must be 
made, for we must stretch 155 billion tomans through 355 billion 
tomans in construction work. We must either advance all the 
roads some, or delay some and finish some others, and we have 
chosen the latter. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In developing the nation's road 
construction, are we faced with a technological problem, in 
addition to the problem of allocating credits? 
  [Torkan] Fortunately our contractors are quite capable in 
terms of construction capability. Our contracting capability far 
exceeds the development credits for road construction. If we do 
not think about our contractors, these people will be faced with 
unemployment and stagnation. 
  We now have about 300 contractors in the country, of whom 
about 20 are major contractors. We must be able to find work 
outside the country for these 20 major contractors so that the 
other small contractors in the country will be able to find work 
and continue to survive. 
  Two projects in Pakistan have now been turned over to 
Iranian 
contractors, and they are contractors for the Ministry of Roads 
and Transport (these two companies are named Stratus and General 
Mechanic). 
  We have also encouraged several other contractors to go 
outside the country and seek work, and we are supporting them. 
  Because our contractors participate in international 
bidding, 
they have problems that we must solve. We are therefore seeking 
to create a financial and credit fund with the participation of 
the Syndicate of Shipping and Transportation Companies, which 
will support Iranian companies outside the country, grant them 
loans wherever necessary, and issue them letters of credit. In 
reality, by supporting contractors, we will be able to bring 
them into the international market and use their significant 
engineering capacity to generate revenue for the country. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will we advance to the point where we 
will also be paying them subsidies? 
  [Torkan] I do not think they will need subsidies, because 
they are capable in terms of engineering technology and they can 
compete on international markets at the lowest price. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] If the price is low, yes, but if their 
costs get so high that they cannot compete, then what will 
happen? 
  [Torkan] In any case, Iranian contractors can complete a 
task 
at half the cost of foreign contractors. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then why can't our contractors win in 
international bidding? 
  [Torkan] Because we have just begun doing this. Our 
contractors won the bidding in Pakistan, i.e., we did not 
believe that we were capable and we have just become aware of 
our capabilities. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the credits they have 
announced, we may be able to procure something less than half 
the credits needed from government resources. To achieve the 
objective in road building, can we use private sector or foreign 
resources? 
  [Torkan] We certainly can. We have placed numerous 
advertisements in domestic and foreign media seeking financial 
and monetary resources we will be able to use to carry out large 
projects. We will have to use nongovernment resources to build 
the freeway from Tehran to the north. With the help of bank 
credits, we are now building the Qazvin-Zanjan freeway. 
  This freeway must continue from Zanjan to Tabriz and then to 
the Bazargan border. Turkey also wants to build a freeway from 
Ankara to our border. This transportation superhighway will be a 
road for ECO and Central Asia. 
  We are now building the Tehran-Saveh freeway with credits 
from the nation's banks and from commerce. This year we decided 
to extend that same freeway to Solfchegan and then from there to 
Arak. 
  In Khuzestan Province we are also hoping to build roads from 
Ahvaz to Abadan and from Ahvaz to Andimeshk with war region 
reconstruction credits. Ultimately, we want this to become a 
national freeway connecting Tehran to Khorramshahr and Abadan. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] To some extent the nature of domestic 
participation is clear. What will be the nature of foreign 
participation in this matter? 
  [Torkan] This can be done in two ways. One is they can make 
us a loan, which must be at a low price. We will repay the loan 
with tolls we will collect on the freeway. 
  The other way is that they can do the work on the BOT 
[Balance of Trade] basis. That is, they themselves will build 
the road and then operate it for a period of time. After their 
period of operation ends, they will turn it over to us and 
leave. We are conducting negotiations now on both procedures. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you think the BOT form of investment 
will meet needs in Iran? 
  [Torkan] Definitely. Imam Khomeyni Airport, the freeway from 
Tehran to the north and the Mazandaran coastal road are meeting 
our needs in this way. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Have you proposed these procedures to 
foreigners? 
  [Torkan] Yes, this has been proposed both to Iranians and 
foreigners. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] One of the important responsibilities 
assigned to the Ministry of Roads and Transport came after the 
expansion of ECO, when the ECO center of transportation and 
shipping was moved to Iran and Iran became recognized as one of 
the countries responsible for transportation and shipping for 
ECO. In view of this, what will the policies of the Ministry of 
Roads and Transport be? 
  [Torkan] When one speaks of transportation and shipping, it 
is necessary to divide the subject into various categories, such 
as transportation and shipping by road, railroad, sea, and air. 
These must be considered separately. 
  With regard to air transportation and shipping, we are 
seeking ECO control. As you know, there are routes in the air 
just as there are routes on land. If these routes have radar 
coverage, they are like the freeways we have on land. Therefore, 
the air freeways are air routes with radar coverage. 
  We therefore paid attention to air routes after the triumph 
of the Islamic revolution, just as we bought aircraft for the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's airline companies HOMA [Iranian 
National Airlines] and ASMAN [National Airline Services 
Company]. Nongovernmental airlines such as Kish Air, Mahan Air, 
Caspian, and Safiran were established and began doing 
transportation and shipping work. These are airlines. We have 
also given attention to air bases. We have built many airports 
and many are also under construction, but what has not received 
attention is the matter of air routes. 
  Of course, air routes do not come to mind very much. Most 
people do not think that roads must also be built in the sky. 
They think roads do not exist in the sky and that everyone goes 
wherever he wants to go. The respected Majles deputies and the 
nation's political and regional officials all want to build 
airports, but no one wants to build those roads. It is one of 
our weaknesses, and we are now investing to develop air routes. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What have you done with regard to 
maritime routes? 
  [Torkan] The Ministry of Roads and Transport's main policy 
is 
to develop transportation and shipping on the Sea of Mazandaran. 
We are now building two ports, Mirabad and Fereydunkenar, which 
will expand our transportation and shipping capacity on the Sea 
of Mazandaran. 
  Our problem is that our railroad is on the east side of the 
Sea of Mazandaran but our main port is on the west side of it. 
By order of the president of the republic, we are to build docks 
at Bandar-e Torkman and Bandar-e Gaz in order to connect the 
railroad to the Sea of Mazandaran. 
  With the development of Bandar-e Torkman we will bring 
maritime transportation and shipping to our own railroad. Thus, 
in this way from ports such as Makhach Qel'eh, Astarakhan, 
Kerasnavask, and Bakuvaktav we will be able to put our railcars 
on ships, bring them to Bandar-e Torkman and put them on our own 
rails to go to Bandar 'Abbas. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Is the development of the southern 
maritime routes also on your agenda? 
  [Torkan] Our ports in the south have good capacity. In 
Chabahar we have two large commercial ports. One is Martyr 
Kalantari and the other is Martyr Beheshti. At Jask there is a 
port, at Bandar 'Abbas are the Martyr Bahonar and Martyr Raja'i 
ports, we are building a port at Kangan, we are building the 
Bandar-e Emam port at Bushehr, and finally, the reconstruction 
of the port at Abadan has been completed and the reconstruction 
of the port at Khorramshahr is underway, but transportation and 
shipping and trade are already taking place there. 
  Many small fishing ports have also been built in the 
southern 
part of the country. In Sistan va Baluchestan Province since the 
revolution several ports, including Baris, Ramin, Haftom-e Tir, 
and Tays have been built. By the end of the year [20 March] we 
will complete Pasa Bandar, and there is another port at Kalak, 
where a fishing dock must be built. 
  Of course, since the revolution the ports at Hormoz Island, 
the multipurpose dock at Qeshm and several old ports at Abu Musa 
have been rebuilt. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You have mentioned the railroads in our 
country. In the last few years the railroads have tried to 
separate themselves from the government budget in order to 
operate as a company, and there are problems in this area. 
First, tell us what the fate of the railroads will be. Can they 
manage themselves? Second, tell us your plans for developing the 
railroads, because the railroad does not currently meet all of 
the nation's needs. 
  [Torkan] The railroads have already been separated from the 
government budget. The main task before us is to try in the 
second half of the year 1373 [23 September 1994-20 March 1995] 
to complete the Bafq-Bandar 'Abbas rail line, and then to 
complete the Mashhad-Sarakhs rail line by the end of the year 
1374 [20 March 1996]. 
  We have several bottlenecks in the Tehran area that we need 
to eliminate. One is Aprin, which is the largest freight 
unloading facility in south Tehran. Then there are the two rail 
lines, one that connects Aprin to Maleki, between Tehran and 
Karaj, and the one that connects Aprin to the Bahram station 
between Tehran and Varamin. These two lines really make it 
possible for us to do shipping and transportation between the 
west and east parts of the country without going through Tehran. 
  Another project, now under way, is to make the Tehran-Qom 
line, which is a bottleneck in the southern part of the country, 
into a two-way line. Parts of that will be finished by the end 
of the year [20 March]. 
  These are tasks that are being implemented. We also have 
projects in the Second Five-Year Plan. One is the Bafq-Mashhad 
railroad, and one is the Kerman-Zahedan railroad. The 
Bafq-Mashhad line will make it possible for us to go from 
Sarakhs to Mashhad, from Mashhad to Bafq and from Bafq to Bandar 
'Abbas. 
  The direct line from the eastern part of the country to 
Bandar 'Abbas, Kerman, and Zahedan is the bottleneck in the rail 
connection between Singapore and Paris. The India and Pakistan 
railroads go to Zahedan, and the European railroads come through 
Iran to Kerman. When we connect Kerman and Zahedan, this 
international network will be connected. 
  Several other projects are also being discussed such as the 
Tehran-Mashhad and Tehran-Esfahan high-speed rail lines. We want 
to complete this project with nongovernmental investments. We 
are seeking an investor for these tasks, and we are negotiating 
with foreign companies in this regard. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Our railroads are quite old and 
worn-out. 
Unfortunately, they have become weaker in terms of safety. What 
is your view concerning this? 
  [Torkan] I do not completely accept this. Our railroads are 
old, but they are good. They have also been rebuilt in the years 
since the triumph of the Islamic revolution. 
  For example, the rails have been changed on our 
Tehran-Mashhad line from Tehran to the other side of Shahrud, 
which is the Bokran station, and it has new ties. This line is a 
new line. The line from Tehran to the south has been rebuilt and 
the rails have been welded together. The parts of the railroad 
and the rails are no longer separate. The rails have been welded 
together with new technology and the vibrations and shaking on 
the train have been reduced along the entire route. 
  Our railroads are a great investment. Although the 
locomotives are worn out, fortunately, during Mr. Sa'idi-Kiya's 
tenure, 120 locomotives were purchased from Canada, of which 44 
have come into the country so far. God willing, the rest will 
also come into the country, and the locomotive power in our 
railroads will be reinforced. 
  Likewise, with the start-up of the rail passenger car 
production line at Pars Wagon, we are buying these cars and they 
are being produced for us at full capacity. The passenger cars 
you now see on our lines are the domestically produced products 
of Pars Wagon. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Unfortunately the operation of railroads 
in our country is done with very old technology. Today, such 
railroads are not used in the world. They have powerful radio 
communications lines and much more powerful controls. What is 
your view on this? 
  [Torkan] No, we have these kinds of communications and 
controls. It is not as you say. We now have electronic controls 
on the Tehran-Tabriz line. We have remote controls on the 
Tehran-Yazd line. There are computer controls on the Bafq-Bandar 
'Abbas line, and these are among the newest controls in the 
world. 
  Of course, I agree with what you say about the 
Tehran-Mashhad 
line, which is an old line. We have now signed a contract with a 
foreign company, and with the transfer of the technology to the 
country, the equipment will be rebuilt from Tehran to Bekran 
under this contract. We ourselves will rebuild the line from 
Bekran to Mashhad with equipment we have already built ourselves. 
  One line that is still old and for which we have no plans is 
the Tehran-Sari-Gorgan line. Of course, this line has old line 
controls and I also agree with what you say concerning this line. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] There been several railroad accidents 
recently. In studies that have been done it has become clear 
that we have had these accidents solely because of the lack of 
technology. There is also the fact that our rail intersections 
are on the same level, especially in the major cities such as 
Tehran. What is your view in this regard? 
  [Torkan] There is a problem, and unfortunately it is 
reflected in the major media. When a train jumps a rail, we call 
that an accident. Formerly these incidents were not recorded and 
the problems were solved at the site itself. Now, however, we 
send the Accident Investigation Council to study the cause at 
the site. These things we call accidents and are shown in our 
monthly statistics are not solely collisions between two trains. 
  We have required the railroads to report on these kinds of 
accidents with these same details so that we can resolve the 
defects. 
  Of course, the railroad officials are worried and they do 
not 
want these reports to appear in the media. They are asking me 
not to report these problems on paper, and leave it to them to 
deal with them themselves, but I do not agree. I believe that 
these things must be fully reported and investigated by the 
Accident Investigation Council. 
  One problem we have concerning accidents is that they take 
place in the cities. If you travel by train on the 
Tehran-Qa'emshahr-Sari line, you will see that the people have 
trespassed on the railroad's right-of-way all along the route. 
Most of the people have made the doors to their homes open 
facing the railroad, and even in these right-of-way areas and 
along the rails they have built many homes. These problems cause 
various accidents, especially involving children. We must 
therefore prevent accidents by not trespassing on the railroad's 
right-of-way. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Of course, as you said there are many 
problems like this in the north, but this problem has also 
spread now in Iran. As you know we had an accident with a police 
car and a train, and a train collided with an automobile in 
Rabat-e Karim. Eyewitnesses say that the traffic control 
equipment was not working or the control bar did not come down 
in time. Railroad officials claim that they do not have the 
budget. My view is that one of the real problems with railroad 
development is that we must increase railroad safety. 
  [Torkan] We must create an atmosphere in society where they 
do not trespass on the railroad right-of-way, and whoever does 
must bear the responsibility for his own blood. We are now 
widening the railroad right-of-way from Tehran to Saveh. We are 
now also designing and building bridges and making the lines 
two-way. The entire route from Tehran to Aprin is being made 
two-way, and we are protecting the two directions with guard 
rails, although the people are breaking down these rails and 
going back and forth, and this struggle continues. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the light administration of 
the railroads, will this company be able to meet its costs? 
  [Torkan] No, the railroad cannot manage itself at these 
rates. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Are subsidies being paid now to the 
railroads? 
  [Torkan] Unfortunately the railroad is now eating out of its 
own pocket. That is, it gets its spare parts from its own 
warehouses, because the government does not give it foreign 
exchange. Thus the railroads are using parts without buying 
parts. They are not restocking the items consumed in the 
warehouse. This is a great problem and we will have to revise 
the railroad transportation and shipping costs. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will this revision show up in next 
year's 
budget? 
  [Torkan] Of course, this revision has been applied to the 
railroad company's budget. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the air rates for 
transportation and shipping? 
  [Torkan] In Europe, air transportation costs $80 per seat 
per 
hour, and we now collect $8 per seat per hour. The unregulated 
lines such as Iran Aerator get $15 per seat per hour. So far, 
the government has paid subsidies to us so that this year we got 
13 billion tomans in subsidies. This subsidy will be eliminated 
next year, and we will be forced to revise our rates. I think 
$30 per seat per hour is a suitable rate (the fare is $30 per 
person to fly from Tehran to Mashhad). 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do the private companies that now 
operate 
for $15 make a profit? Are subsidies paid to them? 
  [Torkan] No, they do not make a profit and subsidies are not 
paid to them. They are now losing money and if we do not change 
their rates, they will not be able to continue operating next 
year. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of this, how have you been able 
to persuade them to provide their services? 
  [Torkan] The Economic Council has decided that we will not 
increase rates before the end of this year [20 March 1994], and 
we are observing this decision. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Will you also increase the number of 
aircraft? 
  [Torkan] We will definitely increase the number of aircraft. 
However, we are still discussing whether to buy the aircraft, 
lease them, or buy them on a lease-purchase arrangement. We 
think that in view of the worldwide recession in transportation 
and shipping, it is not entirely wise for us to pay cash to buy 
aircraft. We should either lease the aircraft or buy them on a 
lease-purchase agreement. 
  The aircraft manufacturers are seeking to sell the aircraft. 
We think they should provide us with low-cost loans to enable us 
to buy the aircraft from them. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] It is noted that the country needs more 
airlines and aircraft. We are still short on transportation and 
shipping during some seasons. Is the private sector volunteering 
to help in this area? 
  [Torkan] We have given agreements in principle to about 20 
private sector companies to enable them to operate air 
transportation and shipping lines. Of course, if they are unable 
to operate an airline within six months we will cancel their 
agreements in principle, but a number of them have begun 
operating.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ehsan Naraqi; place and date not given] </F>
  [Text] Tehran--What follows are excerpts from an interview 
with Dr. Ehsan Naraqi, a top adviser to the UNESCO 
director-general and author of the book "From Shah's Palace to 
Evin Prison." The 3-hour interview was published in GOZARESH-E 
HAFTEH, a sports, political, social, cultural and economic 
weekly published by 'Ali Mohammad Mahdavi-Khorrami. A 
translation of the interview appeared in AKHBAR. 
<H5>  On penetration of Iranian culture and civilization into </H5>
Central Asia and the Caucasus: 
  "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, these nations were 
naturally interested in reestablishing ties with Iran. In a 
seminar on Central Asia held at UNESCO last month, I said that 
if we assess the services rendered by such Iranian personalities 
as Sepahsalar, Qa'em Maqam and Amir Kabir we would notice that 
their personality was based on three pillars: Iranianism, Islam 
and modernism. We have somebody like Amir Kabir (Mirza Taqi 
Khan, the vizier of Iran's Qajar King Nasereddin (1831-96) about 
whom men like Fereydun Adamiat and Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani have 
written books. In other words, he's a personality with which 
everybody agrees. Amir Kabir was extremely patriotic, devout and 
Muslim and very much interested in sciences. He set up a 
polytechnic institute in Tehran 20 years before the Japanese 
established theirs. Dr. Mosaddeq too was a Muslim, Iran-loving 
and modernist man. During the Pahlavi era the total divegard of 
one of these pillars, Islam, led to inbalance in society with 
the Islamic Revolution being its natural and rational final 
reaction. Naturally in the early days of the Revolution the 
impression existed that Islam was able to take the place of the 
other two elements too. Some went to extremes. But in a 
conversation with Mr. Rafsanjani, when he had just been elected 
president, he said he was like Amir Kabir and would focus all 
his attention on those three main pillars. Because he is a true 
Muslim and believes in being Iranian and in modernism and new 
sciences. That is also true about the Rev Ayatollah Khamene'i. 
Perhaps some elements want to go the extreme course and wrongly 
imagine that they can count on him. But in my opinion they are 
mistaken, for His Reverence (the esteemed leader) has proved to 
be an Iran-loving Muslim and a modernist as well. Now it is 
possible that he sometimes tells a faction to stay around as 
well, but in the final analysis he believes in those three 
branches. I have seen it myself that this mode of thinking 
exists more or less among officials and second-rank statesmen 
too. From all this I mean to deduce that Central Asia turns to 
Iran when it sees Iran rest on these three pillars. They are 
seeking an Iran which can offer them a suitable combination. 
They need each and every of these three factors: Islam, Iran and 
modernity. And so, a balanced behavior and the way we approach 
the Central Asian and Caucasian republics is reckoned to be a 
mojor element. We have to be sensitive and alert. We must not 
subject them all of a sudden to extremist and harsh elements, 
for they would quickly be driven away from us, as was observed 
in certain cases, particularly at the beginning. But I hope 
everything will get into its proper course with all these 
comings and goings and the aid Iran is providing these 
republics." 
<H5>  On the PLO-Israel agreement: </H5>
  "Two or three years ago and before the present peace plan 
the 
PLO representative in UNESCO told me, `Deep down we are not 
dissatisfied with the Iranian government's tough anti-Israel 
positions for we can tell Israel we have in the Orient and among 
Islamic states countries which would not agree with the peace 
process and negotiation and so you'd better come down and give 
in to our rightful demands.' With this reasoning, my impression 
is that Iran, with its opposing stand is actually helping 
Palestine indirectly. And so for political isolation, we 
shouldn't worry, because we are defending the Palestinians, on 
the basis of an ideological-religious link with them, as a 
Muslim innocent people subjected to the Zionists' oppression. Of 
course, some maintain that Iran's opposing the peace process and 
then being left alone in the region may cause our country to go 
under the burden of making commitments to the Palestinians. But 
even this is nothing to worry about. Our diplomats, according to 
a French politician I recently spoke to, are very clever and 
know what path they are treading. Our Foreign Ministry and its 
diplomats have calculated everything and know what will happen 
next, just like chess players. Anyway, I think our positions are 
not going to harm us. I do believe that Iranian diplomats are 
patriots, faithful and have strong Islamic convictions and that 
they don't use those convictions as an excommunicating stick." 
<H5>  On Salman Rushdie: </H5>
  "Apart from the fact that I'm against the prize offered for 
killing Rushdie, I am critical of three points. Firstly, our 
compatriots, notably the clergymen and Muslim intellectuals have 
not yet made any attempt to analyze the book, `The Satanic 
Verses'. They have merely endorsed the fatwa, without making it 
clear why the Imam issued the fatwa for the killing of Rushdie. 
The only substantial thing I have seen is a book by Mr. Ataollah 
Mohajerani. Sometime ago he made a speech at the Human Rights 
Commission which was highly based on reasoning. I could see 
clearly that the majority of those who listened to Mr. 
Mohajerani's speech on the fatwa were impressed. My second 
criticism is that the fatwa process, instead of being explained 
to the Westerners through non-government channels, is purely 
handled by the government. In my opinion making the fatwa a 
state matter is a weak point. Fatwa is a religious action and so 
all those conversant with religious laws should express opinion 
in this regard. My third criticism is that although the Islamic 
Conference Organization has verified the fatwa on two occasions, 
we have not yet been able to bring other Muslim countries onto 
the stage. A conference or seminar is still to be held on this 
subject. Last December 7, French television asked questions from 
seven or eight persons, including myself, about Salman Rushdie 
and then Rushdie appeared before the TV camera and for three 
hours talked about the views expressed by us. I was the only one 
who taked against Rushdie. I told the French television, `I 
don't understand it. If you have anything against Imam 
Khomeyni's fatwa, OK, fine, that's something. But then you don't 
have to give credit and award to someone who has insulted the 
beliefs of more than one billion Muslims. Well, you can say 
execution is a heavy punishment, but you can't claim Rushdie has 
committed no crime. Rushdie is asking us to endorse his freedom 
of being slanderous and abusive. Rushdie is telling us he's 
being chased, but it was only last month that he was in 
Washington and the week before that he was in, France, Germany, 
Spain and Italy. What chase? It's you who is chasing us! You go 
wherever you like. What's all this. You'd better go and be 
thankful to all that publicity which caused your worthless book 
to sell so much and made you famous.' 
  "I told French television, `You're mistaken if you think 
with 
all this pressure you're exerting on the Iranian government you 
can help freedom of idea even a bit in the countries without it. 
You are badly mistaken, for to no Muslim intellectual, from 
Morocco to Indonesia, freedom means insulting the Prophet of 
Islam.' I was asked what I would suggest as a solution. And I 
said instead of going to the White House and complaining to 
Clinton, Salman Rushdie should go to the Muslims in India and 
Pakistan, his bithplace, and repent and ask for forgiveness. If 
he did that then the Muslims of India would be able to ask 
Iranian leaders to show mercy to that creature. The West and 
Rushdie are treading a wrong course; the government and the 
system of the Islamic Republic must continue to resist all these 
pressures. 
  "After John Major, the British prime minister, had a meeting 
with Rushdie I wrote a letter to the newspaper Times, which, of 
course, the British hypocrisy prevented the letter which was 
addressed to Major, from being published. In that letter I asked 
Mr. Major: Wouldn't the Church of England in the 17th century 
have thrown into fire somebody who wrote a book full of insults 
to Saint Mary. 
  "Let me emphasize again that the government and Muslim 
intellectuals of Iran have to resist all these pressures. 
Besides, those Iranians abroad who have subscribed to the 
Support Rushdie Statement have shown utter ignorance. Of course, 
what these 200 individuals have done shouldn't be taken 
seriously. It's more like a childish obstinacy to the Islamic 
Republic. It has no depth or content." 
<H5>  On UNESCO: </H5>
  "The role of UNESCO is very important. It has to bring 
different cultures together and establish understanding among 
them. Now it is possible that some extremeist revolutionaries 
are not very much in favor of this, but there is no other 
choice. First, war and bloodshed has to stop before we can drive 
home what we have to say. There it depends on our own 
competence, capability and capacity. If the Iranian government, 
officials and intellectuals show themselves more than this, 
UNESCO too will be able to reflect like a mirror those features 
to the world." 
<H5>  On Iranian Opposition: </H5>
  "First of all, the opposition abroad has never been a 
movement. Ever since the beginning these groups have been mere 
organizations without reliance on people, and almost all of them 
are on the payroll of foreign countries or the intelligence 
services of alien governments. An example is the Mojahedin 
Organization which is fed by Saddam Husayn. There are also 
gentlemen like Manuchehr Hezarkhani and Nasser Pakdaman who, 
unfortunately, at one time cooperated with me during the former 
regime, have now turned completely into Saddam Husayn's men. But 
then, there are a small minority who are getting paid. I haven't 
seen any substantial opponent of the Islamic Republic among the 
majority of Iranians living abroad." 
<H5>  On whether there was any positive current among Iranian </H5>
political groups abroad: 
  "The positive current of these groups is thier failure. When 
in 1986 I went to Europe, some people came to me and asked me if 
I wanted to meet any leaders of those groups. I said I would 
talk to anyone who could tell me how he earned his livelihood. I 
remember an old-time friend who had collaborated with one of 
those dependent groups for one or two years. He opened up a 
bakery in our neighborhood in Paris and it is now some years 
that he's making bread and likes his country and motherland very 
much. Well now you could see more and more of these people there 
whose income is not from suspicious political sources but from 
their own work and activity. Basically, such individuals 
maintain no hard attitude towards the regime. If they have 
criticisms, say of hejab, they are basically a kind of family 
complaint and is not deep rooted. They have no enmity toward the 
system." 
<H5>  On how the Islamic Republic could attract those individuals </H5>
and make use of their knowledge and expertise: 
  "I have often said that 90% of the Iranians abroad, 
even if 
one day they were political refugees, are now cultural and 
mental refugees. They don't consider the Islamic Republic to be 
dependent. My recommendation is to be less stringent. 
Fortunately, this has been done to a large extent during these 
two or three years. Right now, some of our embassies are issuing 
passports to the former emigres who have given up political work 
and the embassy staff are treating them in a human and agreeable 
way. But then it depends on the Islamic Republic, which has to 
provide the condition for these people, to prove effectiveness 
and make it possible for their expertise to be used in the best 
possible way in our industry and economy." 
<H5>  On the country's economic problems: </H5>
  "I think this too has political roots. It is a question of 
how the Islamic Republic interprets the issue. The problem is 
that as yet no single line has been defined for the economic 
policies. The most important question in the Iranian economy is 
that of investment guarantees and boundaries. At present, local 
(as well as foreign) investment has no sufficient guarantee for 
its own stability. The absence of an overall strategy, the 
waywardness of establishments, the lack of coordination among 
organizations and departments, the discrete management and the 
still persisting confusion, which can render management 
unsteady, have forced `capital' to flee our country or ever set 
foot in Iran. So, not only the foreign capital will not come 
here, but the native capital won't get started. This system 
needs reexamination, economically as well as politically. You 
see, the Iranian private sector had make some progress during 
the Shah's time. For example, men like Khayyami and Iravani, who 
are even accepted by the Islamic Republic now, erected a series 
of factories in this country. These men could have been 
preserved and the Islamic Republic and the people could have 
benefited from their work. But unfortunately, we made that 
mistake and out of sheer ignorance we shood everybody, both good 
and bad, away. In fact, we spoiled and destroyed all that we had 
built and belonged to ourselves and had nothing to do with the 
Shah's regime. 
  "To use Hojj Rafsanjani's words, our work is still 
sloganeering. It's still not clear to many devout and dedicated 
individuals that the end is one thing and the means another 
thing. We have all forgotten about the means. Some of the 
officials want to turn Iran into an Islamic Utopia overnight 
without having first secured the prerequisite means, facilities 
and conditions, particularly the world condition. Really, who 
has told you that, say, Iravani is someone fed by Mohammad Reza 
(Shah)? No, it wasn't like that at all. Iravani was someone who 
exploited a specific situation and set up a factory--that's all. 
Or about myslef. It makes me laugh when some people say I was 
associated with the Shah's regime. In all stages of my life I 
have always pursued specific cultural aims. I did deal with the 
regime but wasn't associated with it. I'm afraid, this type of 
mentality in Iran was advertised by the communists and the 
Islamists suffered its blow." 
<H5>  On the effects of the Tudeh (Communist) Party's wrong and </H5>
Machiavellian methods of branding those in the country's 
political environment: 
  "The Tudeh supporters created the atmosphere of mental 
terror 
and repression in our country. They pronounced anyone who had 
breathed in the Shah's regime an associate of that regime. And 
that was while they themselves were for 25 years the unpaid 
lackeys, agents and informants of [the] Russians and the total 
slaves of the KGB. Yet they came and inculcated in some of our 
Islamists that (many of our intellectuals) were Taghuti and 
anti-national. These intellectuals could have been of a great 
deal of benefit to our country. But those instigations and 
insinuations made our country deplete of its potential energy. 
And who committed that treason? The KGB agents and Soviet 
stooges! Take a look at Mr. Kianuri's (former head of the Tudeh 
Party) memoirs. He so brazenly and just to please the Islamic 
Republic changes history and where, for example, the British had 
caused an event says it was the Americans who did it. They are 
not genuine in whatever they do, not even Mr. Ehsan Tabari--who 
some imagine was a man of knowledge, a thinker. This one too has 
in all his historical analyses referred to religion as being 
reactionary in natures. But when the Soviet Union's relations 
with the Muslims turned warmer he called religion progressive. 
  "Our intellectuals are still more or less under the 
influence 
of this communist propaganda. Just look at the position some of 
opponents of the Islamic Republic take. They say since the 
Islamic Republic has developed a series of problems (which it 
has) and has committed a series of extremisms (which it has), 
one must stand up against it and deal with it negatively. This 
is just a side-effect of that very communist propaganda. These 
individuals must be told that the Islamic Republic's men may be 
full of problems, ignorant and uninformed, but they surely take 
no order from and are not dependent on foreigners. They may even 
commit something wrong in the name of Islam, but still they can 
be talked with, for they are independent." 
<H5>  On how to give strength to national unity: </H5>
  "I hope [the] leaders of the Islamic Republic will expand 
their broadmindedness. And if they don't want to formally admit 
their mistakes and errors, at least they could admit it to 
themselves that they have gone wrong in some cases. What is now 
threatening Iran more than anything else is the pressure exerted 
on the educated class. Fortunately the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has scored some success in the field of agriculture--that's not 
to be denied. What the Construction Jihad has done is 
praiseworthy. I have often said what keeps me interested in the 
Islamic Republic, despite all its shortcomings, is primarily its 
political independence and absence of reliance on any power. 
This is such that after 200 years Iran now has a government that 
is standing on its own feet, irrespective of the errors it may 
commit. That the people in the street can now freely criticize 
high prices and economic problems shows the situation of the 
recent 10-15 years has made it possible for one to criticize. 
All this is admirable. But the sort of pressure that is now 
being exerted on a few million educated salary-earners is one of 
the dangers threatening the character and existence of Iran. In 
my view something like 40% of the country's economic woes 
is 
because of divided management and lack of harmony among various 
bodies." 
<H5>  On the Persian translation of his book: </H5>
  "What I would like to ask the Guidance Ministry is not to 
insist on footnotes being everywhere in the book. The book has 
already been published in English, Spanish and Arabic. It's 
about a month that the book has started to be distributed in 
America. Its American publisher has written in his catalogue 
that the book by Dr. Naraqi is a reply to Betty Mahmudi's book 
`Not Without My Daughter'. When I first told Mr. Federico Mayor, 
the director-general of UNESCO, that my book had been published 
in Farsi he got up and said with surprise, "Bravo the Islamic 
Republic. It has let a book which talks of prison and torture be 
freely printed and published.' I have even heard that my book is 
read in turn in the houses of some Islamic Republic officials. 
Of course, I don't mean to conclude they make use of what I 
write, but be sure that they have read it. Fortunately, I have 
benefited by these gentlemen's favor. I have always said that 
the communist climate threw me into jail and the mullahist 
spirit (though some may not like the `word' mullah) saved me 
from death. Now some might say that's why I'm defending the 
Islamic Republic. But that's not so. I defend what is right. 
That's because I know the Islamic Republic has nothing against 
me. My writings all indicate I have always been mindful of 
Islam, mysticism and national questions. What I expect from my 
Muslim brothers is to learn from the earlier extremist mistakes 
and put aside excessiveness and let the way open for dialogue 
and discussion."

  [Text] Economic Service. With Iran's and Turkmenistan's 
joint investment, a decorative-stone producing factory will be 
built in Ashkhabad. ABRAR's correspondent reported from Sari 
that Ashkhabad Television announced in its news program that an 
agreement to build the factory was signed between the Iranian 
minister of mines and metals and the president of Turkmenistan 
in Ashkhabad. 
  Ashkhabad Television also announced that by President 
Niyazov's decree all public buildings in Turkmenistan will be 
decorated with stones. It added that Turkmenistan will continue 
to import decorative stones from Iran until the new factory is 
built. 
  Pointing to the volume of trade between the two countries, 
the television report said that, with the understanding reached 
between the officials of the two countries, the government of 
President Niyazov has started making great efforts in attracting 
Iranian cooperation in advancing the objectives of its economic 
programs.

  [Text] Qom, Abrar Correspondent -- Ayatollah Javadi Amoli 
emphasized: If, God forbid, the people are not present on the 
scene and do not support the Islamic system, and if his holiness 
Imam 'Ali (peace be upon him) also be the spiritual leader of 
that system, then that system will be defeated. 
  Our correspondent reports that Ayatollah Javadi Amoli 
expressed this matter at the Friday prayer service held at 
Mosalla-ye Qods [a place for public prayer] in Qom. He said that 
the people must be present on the scene and the country's 
officials must direct their efforts toward solving the existing 
problems and inadequacies. 
  He glorified the Islamic Revolution of Iran and said that 
the 
revolution's slogans must be preserved. The temporary Friday 
imam of Qom, having mentioned the virtues and graces of this 
humanizing month of Ramadan, asked believers to get close to God 
by devoting themselves to self-making acts and behaviors.

  [Text] The Militant Clergy Association of Tehran in a 
statement has congratulated the followers of the path of the 
founder of the Islamic Republic and the noble people of Iran on 
the advent of the 16th anniversary of the brilliant life of the 
Islamic revolution. 
  The statement says that 15 years ago Khomeyni made a firm 
determination to establish a strong foundation, which has 
continued to grow stronger and more beautiful with our progress. 
  In reference to this point that we are proud of the 
leadership of a people whose imam was considered as the 
brilliant sun of the Islamic Revolution, the statement adds: 
Today no one has any doubt that the beloved Khamene'i is the 
same great Khomeyni, the light of leadership and supremacy, who 
has enlightened the most remote parts of the world thirsting for 
justice, humanism and divinity. 
  The Militant Clergy Association believes that, following the 
painful death of Imam Khomeyni, the secret of the proud 
victories of the people is preserved by the resourceful 
leadership of the revolution, and that the perpetuation of the 
revolution and the successes of the system will remain with the 
group that sincerely obeys Ayatollah Khamene'i, the spiritual 
leader, and understands his guidance and utilizes it in carrying 
out the policies of the system. 
  The Militant Clergy Association of Tehran in its statement 
has emphasized the preservation of the valued gifts of the 
revolution, the perpetuation of combats against oppression, and 
support for popular liberationist struggles. It has said that 
the recognition of the enemy's different moves and the necessary 
preparedness against them will ensure the perpetual movement of 
the revolution. 
  The Militant Clergy Association, indicating that the nations 
of the world are burning with the desire to enjoy living in the 
free atmosphere of the Islamic Republic, has described the 
people of Iran to be the freest people in the world and the 
Islamic Republic as the most independent state. 
  In another part of the statement, the propaganda of 
foreigners about human rights in Iran is condemned. The best 
evidence of the enemy's baseless propaganda is about human 
rights violations in Iran. Combating oppression and injustice 
has been the prime purpose of our nation. 
  The Militant Clergy Association, in another part of its 
statement, after having proclaimed its support for the 
government's economic programs, says that it is unfair to accuse 
the government of having followed a Westernized economic policy. 
It believes that the revolution in terms of the economy has been 
on a logical and desirable course 
  Warning against excessive spending, the statement says that 
a 
life of opulence and luxury is a major plague to a revolutionary 
movement--particularly the Islamic revolution. The public and 
officials must know that an aristocratic and excessive style of 
life cannot be included in the dictionary of the revolution and 
it is not compatible with the divine values of the revolution. 
  The Militant Clergy Association adds that careful control 
and 
supervision of the government's organizations by the 
revolutionary institutions is a most important necessity that 
will reduce at minimum any possible wrongdoing and trespassing 
upon the commonwealth of Muslims (state treasury). 
  At the end, the statement urges the evermore increasingly 
glorious celebration of the Islamic Revolution anniversary on 
this holy day of Bahman 22 [11 February] with the wide 
participation of the devout people of Iran to make America and 
the usurper Zionist regime tremble with fear.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Omar Belhouchet: "Unity of Army Endangered"] </F>
  [Text] The decision by Liamine Zeroual to continue talking 
with jailed leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], a 
dissolved political party, could put the unity of the army in 
danger. A great many of those in the military hierarchy and at 
intermediate grades as well as among ordinary enlisted men do 
not like this way of conducting the political dialogue that, in 
the space of several weeks, favored a marked advance of the 
fundamentalist movement in Algeria. 
  There is, the evidence would suggest, a major risk of seeing 
the country's total destabilization rush forward. Indeed, 
Algeria is currently experiencing the most dramatic moments of 
its young existence since independence. You truly have to be a 
complete innocent to keep on thinking the way some people were 
barely a few months ago. The fundamentalist movement is an 
indivisible whole but one that is subdivided into different 
compartments, oftentimes contradictory ones, to be sure, but 
that is all. Its basic logic is a rejection of the other. 
  The record of the dialogue that can be drawn up is an 
undeniably disastrous one for the country. The state has not 
negotiated from a position of strength. It has given every 
impression that it is discussing from a position of weakness, as 
its numerous concessions, which have produced nothing, 
demonstrate. 
  And this attitude was very well understood by FIS leaders 
who 
not only failed to lift their little finger to put an end to the 
terrorism, despite the concessions made by the Algerian state, 
but who also increased their directives to "burn" the country. 
  The basic question facing Algerians today is to know whether 
the Army is going to stand behind a process that will make 
Algeria disappear a few months from now.

<F P=106> [Article by Sofiane Bensalem: "80 Civilians Murdered in Two </F>
Months"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction 
  [Text] Ahmed Asselah and his son Rabah died 
tragically yesterday, thus joining a long list of victims of 
blind terrorism. Since the beginning of the year, hundreds of 
people--women, children, the elderly, intellectuals, and 
ordinary unemployed people--have been targeted by killers who no 
longer deal in small numbers. 
  Jijel, Setif, Relizane, Mascara, Blida, Medea, Boumerdes, 
and 
Alger are the governorates most affected by this phenomenon. Our 
staff made a breakdown yesterday of the numbers for the period 
from 1 January to 5 March, and it shows that 11 war veterans, 
nine women (including a 94-year-old woman killed inside her home 
in Sidi Ali Boussidi in the Sidi Bel Abbes Governorate and two 
12-year-old girls killed in El Mouradia last 3 February), and 24 
citizens, among them two imams and two mosque caretakers, were 
killed during that period. 
  During the same period, 23 members of the security services 
were killed, mostly in Constantine and Annaba (a city where 
terrorism is making its appearance). Innocence is no protection, 
since four children were also killed. 
  The terrorists went so far as to rip off the head of a 
13-year-old child in the vicinity of Berrouaghia. 
  One DEC [expansion not given], three APC [People's Municipal 
Assembly] officials, and three school principals, including one 
woman, were killed. About 30 schools were set on fire. 
Intellectuals and athletes are favorite targets; three judges 
were killed in the western part of the country, as were the late 
Bouguetaya, vice president of the Judo Federation, boxer Said 
Azzeddine, and journalist Abdelkader Hireche. 
  Three other journalists barely escaped an attack on their 
lives. 
  Members of political parties, especially the FLN [National 
Liberation Front], the RCD [Rally for Culture and Democracy], 
and Ettahaddi, are also targets. 
  Rachid Tigziri, national secretary of Sadi's group, one 
member of that group, 10 rank-and-file members of the FLN, and 
four rank-and-file members of El Hachemi Cherif's party were 
killed in January. The lifeless body of the president of El 
Irchad Oua El Islah, Bouslimani, was found around the end of 
that same month. The terrorists also attacked four foreign 
nationals, including a French reporter. By our count, the number 
of civilians killed stands at around 80. 
  In addition, there were many operations by the security 
services during that period. For example, 191 terrorists were 
killed, and 144 others were arrested. Our count does not include 
the 70 members of the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement] who were 
liquidated by their "enemy brothers" in the GIA [Armed Islamic 
Group]. 
  As far as weapons are concerned, the security services 
recovered 58 automatic pistols, 121 shotguns (most of them with 
sawed-off barrels), 26 homemade bombs, 25 submachine guns, 24 
pump-action shotguns, and 20 walkie-talkies. Concerning the 
socioeconomic infrastructures, the terrorists attacked mainly 
APC offices, municipal enterprises, cultural centers, and 
schools. About 100 publicly owned trucks and about 15 APC 
offices were set on fire. 
  Those criminal acts were perpetrated particularly in the 
governorates of Chlef, Relizane, Ain Defla, and Jijel. Lastly, 
it should be noted that this report is based solely on 
operations and attacks whose details were made public. Because 
of that, the number of murdered civilians and police officers is 
much higher than the figure we knew about. It goes without 
saying that to some extent, a blackout has been imposed on 
security information.

<F P=106> [Interview with Redha Malek before he resigned as Prime </F>
Minister by Omar Berbiche and Ali Bahmane; place and date not 
given: "The State Will Emerge From the Storm the Winner"; first 
two paragraphs are EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Excerpt] The negotiations with the IMF, the social 
cost of structural adjustment, terrorism, and political dialogue 
are the main themes discussed by Redha Malek. 
  [EL WATAN] The IMF agreement will inevitably have a very 
heavy social cost. What does the government plan to do to soften 
the immediate effects on the most disadvantaged classes? Are you 
going to ask the citizens for additional sacrifices? Will they 
be willing to accept them in today's economic situation? 
  [Malek] If there are sacrifices, they will have to be shared 
by all of society, and we will see to it that they are. Both our 
social cohesion and the effectiveness of our reforms are at 
stake. 
  We know that the social safety net has been in place since 
February 1992, but we can see how relatively ineffective it is 
at the moment by the fact that it affects over 7.5 million 
people without satisfactorily targeting those who need the most 
support. 
  We must show imagination in order to give it a more 
consistent content. That should be reflected in the creation of 
jobs and housing assistance for the most disadvantaged. 
Incidentally, the increased availability of scarce resources 
will be of overall benefit to the resumption of certain 
activities, among them construction and public works, and help 
bring down unemployment. Along those same lines, the government 
has plans for a coherent system of social protection comprising 
retirement, early retirement, unemployment benefits, and social 
security. Those measures will be implemented in cooperation with 
our social partners. 
  [EL WATAN] During his last visit to Algiers, the director 
general of the IMF mentioned the possibility of a standby 
agreement for this year. What is the nature of that agreement, 
what will be its amount, and what socioeconomic effects will it 
have? 
  [Malek] A standby agreement, also known as a confirmation 
agreement, runs for one year and is concerned basically with the 
external and internal financial equilibriums. 
  It deals with matters having to do with the price of goods 
and services, the exchange rate, the interest rate, credit 
conditions, the budget, trade, and the foreign debt. 
  Such an agreement precedes the three-year "enlarged 
facility" 
agreement that is concerned with structural adjustment--that is, 
the development of small- and medium-size businesses and the 
private sector, the rehabilitation of state-owned enterprises, 
development of the banking sector, the efficiency of the social 
protection system, and all the measures that strengthen the 
national economy's competitiveness with respect to other 
countries. 
  The enlarged facility being granted by the IMF is 
accompanied 
by programs that must be carried out with the World Bank. 
  [EL WATAN] The IMF director general questioned your 
government on the issue of the government program. That 
insistent concern is not felt only by Camdessus; it is also felt 
by the social partners who are waiting for your program. Why the 
delay? 
  [Malek] Let us understand each other. There is the 
government 
program that has an overall character--political, economic, 
social, and cultural--and on which we are currently working. It 
necessarily takes time. And then there is the "program" that 
Camdessus is talking about and which, in IMF language, has 
specific meaning. It refers to a set of proposals relative to 
the exchange rate, the interest rate, monetary policy, foreign 
trade, the budget deficit, prices, and so on. Those are the 
matters to be covered by the above-mentioned standby agreement. 
It is those proposals--that "program"--that the director general 
of the IMF wants to see adopted by Algeria as the expression of 
a free choice arising from its desire for reform, not as 
something forced on it from outside. 
  [EL WATAN] There has been talk of a cabinet reshuffle. 
Certain cabinet posts remain to be filled. Is the matter being 
considered? 
  [Malek] We are working on it. You may think that we are not 
moving very fast. But there is a time for everything. The main 
thing is to move forward. 
  [EL WATAN] Does this mean that the government will remain as 
it is after the CNT [National Council for Transition] is 
installed? Is yours a long-term government? 
  [Malek] Government instability carries a high cost; everyone 
agrees on that. But that does not prevent some people from 
continuing to speculate on the subject. It is as though 
instability would serve their purpose. Any pretext that will 
encourage a wait-and-see attitude is acceptable to them. We must 
get rid of that suicidal way of thinking. And this at a time 
when we are faced with serious security problems and when we are 
having to confront economic and social problems which, for their 
part, will not wait. 
  [EL WATAN] Exactly what is the state doing to face up to the 
situation of violence? Your statement that not everything has 
been done to combat terrorism is perplexing. Can it be said 
today that those steps are being taken? 
  [Malek] I merely meant that the state has great capabilities 
for making itself respected and that those multifaceted 
capabilities must be used more rationally and with more 
determination. 
  To hear certain experts in disinformation tell it, you would 
think the state was at the end of its rope and near collapse. 
People who think that way are simply confusing their desires 
with reality. The Algerian state, the historic achievement of an 
age-old struggle, is unshakable. It will emerge from the storm 
the winner. 
  It is true that we are experiencing a tragedy. But the 
terrorist crimes being perpetrated daily condemn themselves by 
their absurdity--the horrible nature of their barbarity. No 
cause and no excuse can justify them. The population as a whole 
rejects them. This is something that should be pondered by all 
those who, at one time or another, have thought they could make 
religious feeling a convenient tool for their ambitions. But the 
thing that is perplexing is the strange silence of a certain 
element of the opposition regarding terrorism. Can a political 
official worthy of the name, whether in power or not, reasonably 
keep silent and maintain a wait-and-see attitude in the face of 
a phenomenon that is a terrible disservice to the country, 
tarnishes its reputation, and humiliates Algeria as a nation? 
  [EL WATAN] The agreement between the government and the UGTA 
[General Union of Algerian Workers] has been denounced in part 
by the union, according to recent statements by Benhamouda 
regarding the government's failure to live up to its commitments 
with respect to the amount of the financial package intended to 
pay for the wage increases. Is the agreement being broken? 
  [Malek] Not at all. We reached an agreement, and we are 
sticking to it. So it will be implemented. The wage increases 
will be paid, as stipulated, beginning on 1 April, and will be 
retroactive to 1 January 1994. 
  [EL WATAN] The success of dialogue also depends on the 
adoption of pacification measures. The HCE [Higher State 
Council] announced that new pacification measures would be 
adopted as dialogue continued. Is that still on the agenda? 
  [Malek] Let us give the new presidential body time to settle 
in. President Liamine Zeroual will find ways and means for 
resuming effective dialogue. 
  [EL WATAN] What is your position on the rehabilitation of 
the 
FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] under its current name or another 
name and on dialogue between the government and the FIS? 
  [Malek] That party has been dissolved. There can be no 
prospect of going back to square one. We simply say that chances 
for dialogue exist with all sincere patriots who distance 
themselves from terrorism and recognize that it leads nowhere, 
stick to constitutional order, and agree to work within the law. 
  [EL WATAN] On that subject, what is your comment on the 
attitude of the political parties? 
  [Malek] The parties need to be a little more constructive. 
They should take advantage of the transitional period to 
contribute to national unity, democracy, and a solution to the 
crisis. 
  [EL WATAN] Some people are predicting civil war for Algeria. 
  [Malek] Despite the terrorist crimes, the population is 
maintaining its attachment to peace and public order. 
  In those conditions, how can one talk of civil war? The 
people talking about it are the one who want it. But once again, 
they are wrong. 
  [EL WATAN] Some states are openly displaying hostility to 
Algeria. 
  [Malek] Algeria harbors no animosity toward anyone. What is 
certain is that it does not allow any interference in its 
internal affairs and will be able to respond to such 
interference with appropriate means, as it has done up to this 
point. In that connection, it should be pointed out that despite 
the difficulties it is experiencing, Algeria remains attached to 
its national sovereignty and rejects all forms of pressure, 
regardless of their origin. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to deplore the 
development of systematic disinformation on the part of certain 
foreign media with respect to Algeria. It plays into the hands 
of subversion and certainly does not help to shed light on what 
is really at stake in the current situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article filed by the EL WATAN bureau in </F>
Annaba: "Security: Annaba Unbearable"--first paragraph is EL 
WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Day after day, Annaba, the steel capital, is 
becoming increasingly unlivable. The cause of this is the 
presence of several gangs of armed hooligans who haunt downtown 
attacking and robbing young women, mothers, and even fathers 
with families. 
  Annaba--It is a practice that has become widespread and is 
encouraged by passivity, indeed by the cowardliness of some who 
under other circumstances would become conscientious objectors. 
  So at a time when some people wallow in unchecked 
carelessness and slovenliness and take home a salary for work 
that they no longer do, some crazies organize themselves into 
gangs to produce a reign of terror on sidewalks, streets, and 
within our government institutions. 
  Annaba has now regained its 1980's title as the most rotten 
city in Algeria, literally and figuratively. It is a city in 
which vagrants, speculators, swindlers, traffickers, influence 
peddlers, racketeers, housebreakers, and pickpockets fight over 
workers' salaries. Jostled, indifferent, and discouraged by so 
many disappointments, these workers get drawn into a feeling 
that everything is sinister and catastrophic and still try to 
keep the words fatherland and patriotism in their vocabularies. 
  The gangs of pickpockets get organized, and so do the 
prostitutes and young homosexuals. These veritable carriers of 
viruses and other veneral diseases, veiled or not and even 
wearing the hijab, and in the company of young toughs, can be 
found near the Law School campus, at Sunrise Beach, and on 
Revolution Avenue soliciting customers or discussing "the price" 
with drivers, most of whom are farmers in high spirits after the 
breaking of the fast. 
  If as regards security [text illegible] the darkest period 
of 
its existence, on that of business and prices, it is a massacre. 
It isn't only speculators who do it, it is practically all young 
people who have begun to engage in speculation, particularly 
with products subsidized by the state. 
  At the El-Hatab Market, at the marketplace, everywhere 
private business is established, the price checking service has 
died. It is the big department stores that pay the piper or 
justify our "brave" checkers coming out. There is the El-Hadjar 
EDGA, the only store out of 31 others located in five wilayas, 
that has miraculously saved the store's credibility by putting 
products within reach of modest pocketbooks and by making a 
constant effort to supply the population of El-Hadjar and 
elsewhere; it is the only store to have dealt with most of its 
bank overdraft and saved 85 jobs; it has just been the victim of 
a genuine scene entitled "hoarding food." 
  Now from a survey conducted among a large number of 
El-Hadjar's citizens it appears that ever since the arrival of 
the store's new director, the people of El-Hadjar have somewhat 
forgotten the word shortage in the sense that with respect to 
[text illegible] and that the sale of goods in an atmosphere of 
tension occurs under the eye of the daira's security services. 
The various people surveyed reported that there was manipulation 
by the speculators' lobby, which the activity and the efforts 
made by the El-Hadjar EDGA were disrupting. Workers in the store 
also unanimously agreed that the case had been fabricated and 
that they wholeheartedly supported the director of their store. 
  In fact, if there is hoarding, you need to look for it 
closer 
to El-Hatab, the marketplace, in the big department stores. 
Where semolina and flour are concerned, certain shopkeepers, 
particularly those in Oued Eddeheb, no longer worry about 
selling their products since they are already sold well before 
they get there, but not to neighborhood consumers. 
  Unlivable by day, Annaba is also unlivable after the 
breaking 
of the fast. Although they have been closed for several hours, 
the cafes, cafeterias, and drugstores are dirty and repellant. 
Prices for food have doubled. If you want to buy a few grams of 
kalb ellouz, baklava, or hrissa, you need to spend several dozen 
dinars.

<F P=106> [Article signed "S.G.": "Security Forces: Redeployment in </F>
the Algiers Region"] 
  [Text] In the space of five days, security forces have put 
about 60 terrorists out of commission, two-thirds being in the 
Algiers area, the "zone" currently considered to be the most 
active and most dangerous when it comes to the resurgence of 
crime and economic sabotage. Indeed, throughout the entire 
period of the month of Ramadan, terrorists redoubled their 
ferocity by stepping up the number of murders of citizens and 
police officers and destroying numerous schools and industrial 
plants. 
  Among the criminals killed, several wanted "heads" have been 
identified. Here is proof that the "mouse traps" set up by the 
combined security forces have been very efficient and that even 
more spectacular results may be expected in the antiterrorist 
fight. 
  Furthermore, the killing of 57 dangerous criminals (all 
well-known fundamentalists) in a relatively short space of time 
is evidence of a general redeployment in recent days by the 
security forces, which seem to be going resolutely on the 
offensive. 
  So, for example, numerous roadblocks have again been set up 
at strategic crossroads, while certain areas such as Blida, for 
example, are under more sustained military surveillance. 
Round-up operations have also picked up, following the example 
of those carried out on the outskirts of the capital. In this 
same vein, it has been pointed out that yesterday the entire 
area stretching over the heights of the neighborhood called "The 
Orchards" was entirely surrounded by security forces. The reason 
for this was that a very active terrorist group was operating in 
that region and was even the cause of several altercations with 
security forces. So the residential "Orchards" neighborhood was 
serving as a refuge for this fearsome group that was terrorizing 
nearby areas such as Birkhadem and Kouba. So this entire zone 
was put under heightened, though discreet, surveillance. 
  It is the same for the Casbah, where terrorist groups, 
aided, 
it needs to be said, by several accomplices among its citizens, 
were growing with considerable ease. The old city was tending 
towards becoming a veritable ghetto in which residents found 
themselves completely terrorized. This area seems to have been 
retaken by the authorities, who have attempted to carry on the 
fight until the end to clean the Casbah of its dangerous 
criminals and allow citizens to resume their normal lives.

<F P=106> [Article by Mamduh al-Wali: "The Annual Report on Economic </F>
Performance for 1993 Says: Important Indicators of Economic 
Stability and Success of the Liberalization Policy, Including 
Decrease in Inflation, Stabilization of Interest Rates on 
Deposits, and Increase in Energy Production"] 
  [Text] The Center of Information and Decision-Making 
Support in the Cabinet, under the supervision of Dr. Hisham 
al-Sharif, has prepared a comprehensive report concerning 
Egypt's economic performance in 1993. According to the report, a 
number of economic indicators provide evidence of Egypt's 
economic stability and the success of its economic 
liberalization policy, the most important of these being the 
decrease in the rate of inflation, stability of banking 
transactions, and an increase in domestic production of all 
types of energy. 
  By means of an examination of the most important information 
that appeared in the annual report dealing with Egypt's economic 
performance in 1993, we can monitor the important economic 
indicators in this "economic thermometer." 
  First we note the most important indicator of the economic 
stability, the success of the fiscal policy, and the monetary 
transactions, and this is the clear decrease in rates of 
inflation during the months of 1993, as opposed to the months of 
1992. After inflation reached 22.1 percent in May of 1992, it 
began to decrease slowly during the subsequent months until it 
dropped to 13.6 percent by the end of the year. 
  In 1993, inflation continued to gradually go down until May, 
when it was 10.6 percent, and then it once again went up 
slightly until it reached 12.1 percent during the months of 
November and December. 
  The indicator of foreign currency exchange rates during 
1993, 
until the end of the first week of February of the current year, 
shows an increase in the exchange rates of the dollar and the 
Japanese yen, whereas there was a decrease in the exchange rates 
of the pound sterling, the German mark, the French franc, and 
the unified European currency. Although the exchange rate of the 
dollar rose only slightly all during 1992, the dollar underwent 
lots of rate changes in during 1993. In January of 1992 its rate 
was 332.47 piasters, and in January of 1993 its rate was 333.76 
piasters, but by January of 1994 its rate had risen to 337.24 
piasters and it went up several milliemes by the first week of 
February of this year. 
<H5>  Continuing Decrease </H5>
  The interest rate on treasury bonds continued to go down 
during the last two years. After having been 19.6 percent in 
October of 1991, it went down to 16.6 percent by the end of 1992 
and was 14.4 percent by the end of 1993. The average interest 
rate by the first week of February of this year was 13.8 percent. 
  This decrease had an effect on the continuation of the 
decrease of the average interest rate on deposits in Egyptian 
pounds. After the rate had been 18 percent in January of 1992, 
it went down to 15.2 percent by the end of the year. During the 
first half of 1993 it continued to decrease, and it has hovered 
around 12.5 percent since last July until the first week of 
February of this year, and it is expected to decrease slightly 
during the coming months. 
  These expectations are reinforced by the decrease in the 
relative difference between the rate of inflation and the 
interest rates on deposits. During the months of November and 
December of last year, the rate of inflation reached 12.1 
percent. Likewise, there was a continued decrease in the lending 
and discount rate, which had fallen to 20.5 percent in January 
of 1992, then 18.5 percent in January of 1993, and then 16.25 
percent by January of 1994 and the first week of February of 
this year. However, actual loans made by banks indicated a 
transaction rate of 13 percent. 
  Private sector loans in local currency from banks decreased 
during the second half of 1993, in spite of the liquidity that 
accumulated in the banks. Therefore expectations are that there 
probably will be a decrease in the loan interest rate, since 
this is one of the means by which one can emerge from the 
current situation of stagnation. 
  Interest rates on U.S. dollar desposits have nearly 
stablilized. In January of 1993 they were around 3.25 percent, 
then they went down to 3.04 percent by April of last year, and 
have stayed at this point since then until the first week of 
February of this year 
<H5>  Steady Increase </H5>
  All of the indicators dealing with the Suez Canal show an 
increase in 1993 compared with the previous year. The number of 
ships going through the canal increased by 798, or 4 percent, 
making the total 17,329. The number of oil tankers going through 
the canal increased by 51, or 1.6 percent, making the total 
3,204. Consequently, tonnage carried by ships going through the 
canal increased by about 27 million tons, or 7 percent, making 
the total 397 million tons. This resulted in an increase in 
revenues of about $85 million, or 4.5 percent, making the total 
$l.96l billion. 
  In the sea and air transport sector, there was an increase 
in 
the volume of nonpetroleum goods transported by sea and by air. 
The increase was 14 percent over last year, and totaled 25.987 
million tons. 
  In the sector of land transport, the total number of 
vehicles 
by October of 1993 was 2.236 million, of which 935,000 were 
private vehicles and 384,000 were trucks. 
<H5>  Increase in Firms and Decrease in Bankruptcy </H5>
  The number of stock corporations obtaining operating 
licenses, increased by 29, or 10 percent, over last year, and 
they totaled 847. The Corporations Administration gave its 
approval to 594 of these companies, and the remaining 253 were 
approved by the Investment Authority. 
  The capital of these corporations was 53 percent, or 2.803 
billion pounds, less than the capital of companies which 
obtained licenses in 1992, thus making the 1993 total 2.133 
billion Egyptian pounds, as opposed to 4.754 billion Egyptian 
pounds. [figures as published] 
  Business bankruptcies went down to 4,798 during the first 
nine months of 1993, after they had totaled 5,918 during the 
same period in the previous year. The number of bankruptcies was 
lowest during March of 1993, whereas the highest rate was in May 
of 1993. 
<H5>  Tourism Down </H5>
  Indicators showed a decrease in tourism in 1993, as compared 
with the previous year, of 29 percent in terms of the number of 
overnight stays in Egypt and 20 percent in terms of the number 
of tourists coming to Egypt. The number of tourists who came 
totaled 2.,503 million, representing a decrease of 643,000. The 
total number of overnight stays was 15.890 million, representing 
a decrease of 6.929 million. At the same time, there was only a 
very slight decrease in the average length of stay of the 
tourists, since this figure was 5.8 overnight stays as opposed 
to about 6.7 overnight stays. These indicators were also 
reflected in the total in income earned from tourism until 
November of 1993, which was $1.294 billion, representing a 
decrease of $953 million, or 42 percent, over the same time 
period in the previous year. 
<H5>  Progress in Energy </H5>
  The forms of energy produced were as follows: The total 
production of generated electricity in 1993 was 47.937 million 
megawatt-hours. This represents an increase of 1509 million 
megawatt-hours, or 3.2 percent, over production in 1992. In 
spite of this increase, the total in electric services provided 
was about 1.788 million megawatt-hours, or 4.6 percent, less in 
1993 than it was in 1992. 
  Petroleum production for 1993 increased so that it totaled 
46.364 trillion tons. This represents an increase of 1.109 
million tons, or 2.4 percent, over the previous year. Petroleum 
consumption in 1993 also increased, totaling 21.707 million 
tons, representing an increase of 268,000 tons, or 1.2 percent, 
over the previous year. The percentage of domestic consumption 
of petroleum, as compared with the total production in 1993, was 
46.8 percent, and this represents a 56-percent decrease over the 
previous year. 
  Natural gas production in 1993 totaled 8.884 million tons, 
representing an increase of 1.706 million tons, or 23.7 percent, 
over the previous year. The same increase occurred in natural 
gas services, the total being 8.229 million tons in 1993, 
representing an increase of 1.102 million tons, or 15.4 percent, 
over the previous year. This was reflected in the increase in 
the percentage of total gas consumed as compared with total gas 
produced, which was 99.2 percent in 1993, as opposed to 92.6 
percent in the previous year. 
  Sales of cement in the construction and building materials 
sector decreased by 946,000 tons, or 5.7 percent, over 1992. The 
total for 1993 was 15.553 million tons. The months of January, 
February, and March showed the lowest rates of sales, whereas 
the months of July, August, and September showed the highest 
rates. 
  Unlike sales of cement, sales of reinforcement iron in 1993 
increased over the previous year. This increase was by about 
82,000 tons, or 7.2 percent, and the total for the year was 
1.210 million tons. The month of September showed the lowest 
rate of sales, whereas the months of December and May showed the 
highest.

<F P=106> [Article by Hanan Abu Diya': "Employees Reject Next </F>
Cost-of-Living Pay Increase and Demand That Government Fix 
Prices!"] 
  [Text] A few days ago a committee, chaired by Dr. Husayn 
Ramzi Kadhim, head of the Central Regulation and Administration 
Agency, held a meeting in which the subject of discussion was 
the draft of a new law for government employees. The committee's 
discussions focused on means to guarantee that salaries will not 
be frozen. One of these principal means would be making the pay 
grades open-ended at the top, since this would lead to direct 
salary increases that would not be dependent on promotions. 
Another proposal discussed by the committee involves freeing 
periodic pay increases so that they would not stop at the top of 
the pay scale, or preparation of new salary tables that would 
include making the pay grades open-ended at the top. Still 
another proposal would grant a single pay increase that would 
include both the periodic pay increase and the cost-of-living 
pay increase and would amount to about 10 percent of one's 
salary. 
  Unfortunately, however, increases in salaries--however 
slight--are always followed by increases in prices, and the two 
increases do not match each other. Although 10 percent annual 
cost-of-living pay increases, amounting to an overall increase 
of 110 percent, have been added to salaries during past years, 
prices, according to statistics, have increased 224 percent. The 
strange thing is that officials are still fumbling around 
concerning the next pay increase, and every day we hear about a 
new opinion that already gets changed the following day. 
  On 12 February of this year a meeting was held in the 
Ministry of Finance for the purpose of discussing the 
implementation of the decision by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi, concerning combining the periodic pay increase with the 
cost-of-living pay increase and having this be in effect 
starting with the new budget next July. An official in the 
ministry has said that Dr. Sidqi's decision is the result of the 
government's endeavoring to grant a cost-of-living pay increase 
to government employees when the new budget goes into effect, in 
accordance with the policy of achieving a balance between wages 
and prices and lightening these employees' burdens!! 
  He said that the amount of the cost-of-living pay increase 
to 
be paid out with July's salaries will be finalized during the 
month of April. He pointed out that there are several different 
proposals being studied by the government, including keeping the 
cost-of-living pay increase as it is, that is, separate from the 
periodic pay increase, or combining the cost-of-living pay 
increase with the periodic pay increase. 
  During this period of time the government will study the 
expenses involved in putting into effect the new 10 percent 
increase in government employees' wages next 1 July, and will 
also study the expenses involved in combining the cost-of-living 
pay increase with basic salaries--and these expenses amount to 
about 150 million Egyptian pounds. 
  Dr. Sidqi has previously stated that the government intends 
to grant the cost-of-living pay increase next July, in 
accordance with the policy of achieving a balance between wages 
and prices and lightening employees' burdens. He said that the 
amount of this cost-of-living pay increase has still not been 
determined, that there are ongoing studies dealing with 
instituting it, and that there are different proposals being 
studied by the government, including keeping the cost-of-living 
pay increase separate from the periodic pay increase. 
  He said that he personally would get a pay increase of 21 
Egyptian pounds, and that a minister's pay increase would amount 
to 15 Egyptian pounds. 
  During the same month, Ahmad al-'Awami, minister of manpower 
and employment, announced that the percentage of the 
cost-of-living pay increase for government employees still has 
not been determined and that this matter would, in due time, be 
discussed with the ministries concerned. 
  This information also appears at a time when the media has 
published a statement by Dr. Sidqi to the effect that, during 
the next few days, he will look into the demands of the 
Federation of Labor Unions and Heads of Labor Unions concerning 
raising the percentage of the cost-of-living pay increase, to be 
paid out next July, from 10-20 percent. 
  Of course, all of these statements have aroused resentment 
on 
the part of employees and workers with limited incomes. All 
during the last few years they have heard and read such 
statements, and the only thing that has happened has been the 
payment very small cost-of-living pay increases which have 
lagged far behind pay increases!! 
  All of the above has concerned government employees. As far 
as employees in companies are concerned, the holding companies 
have recently prepared wage tables that have the following 
features, among others: Level 3 of the civil [service] 
positions, including Categories 6, 5, 4, and 3, would have 
starting salaries of between 100 and 300 Egyptian pounds. For 
Level 2 of the technical, administrative, and specialist 
positions requiring intermediate level and high level 
qualifications, including Categories 4, 3, and 2, the starting 
salaries would be between 120 and 300 Egyptian pounds. For Level 
1 of all higher positions, including even the director of a 
department, the starting salaries would be between 150 and 400 
Egyptian pounds. The wage tables also would include the fact 
that the proposed periodic pay increase be from 5 to 40 Egyptian 
pounds. 
  All of these things discussed above are merely proposals and 
declarations made unilaterally, that is, made by officials in 
charge. But how do things really stand, and what is being said 
by the employees themselves, the people most concerned? 
  First of all, the proposal being discussed which concerns 
abolishing the top end of the pay scale for the grades of the 
various positions, if applied, would constitute an important 
achievement, especially since, at the present time, employees 
are not allowed to receive any pay increases after arriving at 
the top of the pay scale, unless the law stipulates otherwise. 
There is nothing stated in Law 47 of 1978 which permits this. 
However, we note that Law 6 of 1977, which was issued in order 
to grant an additional pay increase to employees as of 1 January 
1977, does permit the granting of this pay increase, even if an 
employee, by receiving such a pay increase, would have pay which 
would go beyond the top pay scale stipulated for his position. 
This law has been in effect in this area, and it predates Law 47 
of 1978. 
  Another legal passage of this type that constitutes an 
exception is the passage in Article 103 of Law 47 of 1978 
dealing with transfer regulations that stipulates that employees 
shall have either the starting salaries of the positions to 
which they are transferred or a pay increase, whichever is 
greater, even if this means that they would thus have pay that 
goes beyond the top end of the pay scale, and this pay increase 
shall not affect the employees' periodic pay increases. 
According to this passage, an employee shall be granted an 
additional pay increase even if this means that his pay will go 
beyond the top end of the pay scale for the position's grade. 
There is also Passage No. 52, which constitutes an exception and 
which stipulates the granting of an incentive pay increase even 
if this means that the employee's pay would go beyond the top 
end of the pay scale for his grade. 
  Rushdi Muhammad says: "I have been a Category 1 employee for 
10 years. I don't care about grades or pay increases after 
seeing that my salary, incentive payments, and allowances are 
not enough to cover my life's basic necessities for even 10 days 
out of every month!! I suggest that the government be interested 
in people as such before engaging in talk about cost-of-living 
pay increases. We actually do get a lot of cost-of-living pay 
increases, but the increases in prices are far greater and our 
salaries are not enough to meet our basic needs. They are not 
even enough for our food alone, much less for clothes, housing, 
and medical expenses." He added: "The government is always 
announcing that it has lowered taxes for employees and given 
them wage increases. The truth is that it has taken all this 
away many times over in the form of prices for services such as 
electricity, water, and transportation." 
  Sayyid al-Hujurati, an employee in the water utility, had 
the 
following to say: "What can I do with a 10-percent pay increase 
with the high cost of living that we have? Even though salaries, 
as they say, have increased 100 percent during the last 10 
years, they have not enabled Egyptians to even have enough for 
the basic necessities of life." He feels that it would be more 
worthwhile to fix prices than to give pay increases, and said: 
"I used to buy a kilogram of meat for 68 piasters. But today the 
price of this meat in the 13 consumer cooperatives has gone up 
to 1 Egyptian pound. Is the 10 percent enough to take care of 
the steep rise in the prices of meat, bread, and only the basic 
necessities?" He went on to say: "For three years the officials 
have been saying that they are looking into the matter of making 
pay grades open-ended, but unfortunately this has not happened. 
If it does happen, I believe that it will significantly decrease 
the effect of the high prices which employees suffer from." 
  Samir Muhammad al-Nu'man, an employee in the Egyptian 
Commercial Medicines Co., says: "Giving one a pay increase that 
amounts to 10 percent of one's salary will not add much to the 
salary and will not decrease the burdens on an employee's 
shoulders. Whatever the pay increase is, it is always far less 
than the insane increase in prices. This is particularly true 
because the pay increase is never linked to the increase in 
prices and the current actual value of the Egyptian pound." 
  Dr. Faruq 'Abd-al-Salam says: "As for the matter of 
achieving 
a balance between the system of periodic and cost-of-living pay 
increases now in effect and a permanent pay increase amounting 
to 10 percent of one's salary, this is something that will 
neither hasten nor delay--to either a large or a small 
degree--the problem that afflicts our worn-out Egyptian people. 
We are only talking about a difference in milliemes, which 
cannot keep a person alive. There are three basic reasons for 
saying this. First of all, changing the type of pay increase, 
whether this involves the various kinds of pay increases or 
regular raises, amounts to nothing more than a sedative. This 
would be true even if the regular raise were 100 percent of 
one's salary. The reason for this is that prices nowadays have 
become a vicious monster, which is dozens of times greater than 
any increase in pay that the government might give to its 
employees." 
  Mayisah 'Abd al-Rahim , an employee, says: "By means of 
simple arithmetic I found out that the value of a pay increase 
would not increase my salary by more than 10 Egyptian pounds, 
most of which would be spent on transportation within only a 
two-day period. I would not be able to make use of this pay 
increase to buy anything that I want to buy, especially since 
prices continually go up. I believe that pay increases should be 
in line with price increases and should not be fixed." 
  'Abd al-Rahman Mustafa 'Iraqi, director of a consumer 
cooperatives company, says: "The pay increases, no matter what 
they are, will not be enough to cover the basic necessities of 
average Egyptians. I do not believe that a 10-percent salary 
increase will benefit our citizens. Such a pay increase is not 
enough even to buy just one kilogram of meat or 20 flat loaves 
of bread. If an Egyptian wants to buy a new shirt, he has to 
save the money earned from this pay increase for at least four 
months. The ideal solution is to link the pay increases with the 
rises in prices."

<F P=106> [Interviews with Dr. Fajj al-Nur; Mahmud Fahmi, the former </F>
head of the Capital Market Authority, Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, the 
former economy minister and chairman of the Arab International 
Banking Corporation; and Dr. Hamdi 'Abd-al-'Azim, dean of 
al-Sadat Administrative Sciences Academy-Tanta Branch, by 
'Ala'-al-Din Mustafa; place and date not given--first seven 
paragraphs AKHIR SA'AH introduction] 
  [Text] Since the promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992, which 
regulates the issuance and exchange of securities and companies 
active in securities, there has been incessant talk among 
everyone concerned with economic reforms of stimulating the 
stock market. However, at the same time, efforts have not been 
stepped up to explain and track what is happening in the 
securities market. Such efforts are especially needed, because 
the legislative tools of economic reform, or the improvement of 
the legal frameworks in which investment projects operate, will 
not realize the hopes pinned on them for an improvement in the 
national economy unless the Egyptian capital market and stock 
market resume operating efficiently, to take their place among 
international stock markets and capital markets. 
  In this report, AKHIR SA'AH sheds light on the conditions 
and 
requirements which must be met to expedite the revival of 
Egypt's market. This revival is especially needed in order to 
move ahead with privatization through the offering of public 
companies' shares on the stock market. These offerings will 
achieve the desired goal of expanding the ownership base and 
promoting greater activity and vitality in the capital market 
and stock market. 
  We spoke first with Dr. Muhammad Hasan Fajj al-Nur. He 
states 
that many entered the stock market for the first time after the 
promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992 (the Capital Market Law). 
This law is designed to expand the ownership base, develop and 
stimulate the capital market, and finance the market directly 
through the offering of securities after disclosure of the 
financial positions and distributed profits [of the companies 
whose shares are offered]. As of 7 January 1994, the General 
Capital Market Authority had authorized seven companies, with 
76.5 million Egyptian pounds in capital, to engage in securities 
activity. 
  The authority also authorized the issuance of: 248 original 
shares amounting to 765.8 million pounds or $101.9 million in 
capital, and 138 shares when capital is increased by 975 million 
pounds or $39.9 million; and financing instruments and bonds 
amounting to 60.5 million pounds in capital. 
  The authority also issued seven licenses amounting to 30 
million pounds in capital, and the establishment of 22 labor 
unions, bringing the total number of authorizations to 425 
amounting to capital of 190.78 million pounds or $141.8 million. 
  In addition, the Bank of Egypt was authorized to engage in 
investment fund activity and to issue 500 million pounds in 
investment certificates, and the National Bank was authorized to 
engage in investment fund activity and to issue 100 million 
pounds in investment certificates. 
  According to Dr. Fajj al-Nur, final approval will be given 
after a board of directors for the authority is formed. 
<H5>  Expansion of the Ownership Base </H5>
  [Mustafa] Although more than two years have passed since the 
Capital Market Law was promulgated, the market has still not 
achieved the desired activity level. Why is this so? Can it be 
attributed to reluctance among savings account holders to give 
up their desire for and choice of the safe route of saving in 
banks, especially after the painful experience of the investment 
companies? 
  [Al-Nur] The investment companies affair undoubtedly casts a 
pall on the development of the capital market and on activity in 
the stock market. But an objective reading of the development of 
stock exchange activity over the past two years shows that there 
has been activity and trade. But more time and greater 
awareness, which is the media's role, are needed. 
  Nonetheless, the stock market has undergone technological 
development. The Cairo and Alexandria stock markets have been 
linked, trading in shares and securities has been computerized, 
and operations and trading are monitored on screens. 
  [Background] Dr. Fajj al-Nur stressed that Egypt's capital 
market will succeed only if the privatization program proceeds 
in tandem with it. Privatization requires an expansion of the 
ownership base through the stock market, not through the 
auctioning of public-sector assets. This is especially so given 
the privatization program's main aim, which is to expand the 
ownership base. 
  The expansion of the ownership base differs from the concept 
of the expansion of the private ownership base. Expansion of the 
ownership base entails ownership on a wide scale, i.e., as many 
citizens and workers as possible owning the largest number 
possible of shares in the companies offered for sale. Expansion 
of the private ownership base means auctioning one or more 
assets of a company to one or more buyers. The state's goal at 
this stage is to deepen the sense of identification by expanding 
the ownership base on a wide scale, and to enable capital owners 
to obtain the financing they need to increase their investments. 
The state aims to achieve this through a strong market that is 
based on supervision which relies on transparency and openness. 
<H5>  Development and Modernization of the Stock Market </H5>
  [Mustafa] Where does Egypt's capital market rank among 
international markets? 
  [Al-Nur] Egypt's capital market, which has begun to attract 
attention worldwide, is ranked 20th among 50 recently 
established capital markets, according to a ranking of recently 
established stock markets performed by Euro Money to measure the 
maturity and efficiency of these markets. Taiwan's market is in 
first place. The Southeast Asian markets are also ranked highly. 
Most of them are in the top 20. 
  [Background] Dr. Fajj al-Nur states that the following 
criteria were used to measure the capital markets' efficiency 
and ability to attract foreign investments: 

  -  Market size, which consists of the market's market value 
and the number of securities registered on its stock markets. 
  -  Liquidity, which is the ratio of the total value transacted 
during the past year to the market's total market value. 
  -  Number of weekly trading hours. 
  -  Strength of market concentration, which means the percentage 
of 
market value held by the 10 largest companies, in terms of the 
ratio of total market value to their shares traded, and the 
ratio of the total value traded to the value of their shares 
traded. 
  -  The cost of a transaction, which includes the broker's 
commission, stamp taxes, transaction expenses, and value-added 
taxes. 
  -  The duration of clearance and settlement arrangements. 
  -  Degree of reserve. 
  -  The market's ability to attract foreign investments. 

    According to these criteria, Egypt's capital market is 
ranked 
20th out of a total of 50 markets that have been developed over 
the past decade. This ranking is attributed to the development 
of the market which occurred in particular as a result of the 
promulgation of Law No. 95 of 1992, which regulates the capital 
market. It is also attributed to the programs that were created 
to develop and modernize the stock markets, and the 
encouragement of the business sector to provide services in the 
securities area that had previously been lacking. All of these 
factors have done much to promote the attraction of foreign 
investments, especially investments by large financial 
organizations seeking new markets, especially markets in stable 
countries which pursue sound economic policies, in which to 
spread their investments. 
  Dr. Fajj al-Nur emphasizes that the privatization of 
public-sector units through the stock market will advance the 
capital relative to international capital markets. This will 
draw attention to Egypt's capital market as an important, rising 
market in the world. 
<H5>  The Shares of Public-Sector Companies </H5>
  Justice Mahmud Fahmi, the former head of the Capital Market 
Authority, believes that the liberalization of Egypt's economy, 
progress in the economic reform program, the giving of the 
lion's share of the leadership of economic activity to the 
private sector, and the success of the privatization policy all 
require a strong capital market. Hence, the General Capital 
Market Authority plays an essential, decisive role. One of its 
main tasks is to adopt all of the necessary means to consolidate 
national savings and channel them toward legitimate investment 
channels. This requires stimulating the issues market, i.e., 
establishing stock companies and joint stock companies that 
issue securities (stocks and bonds). It also requires measures 
to induce individuals to invest their savings in these 
securities. The authority is also tasked with supervising and 
controlling the secondary market, which is the securities 
exchange market. It performs this function on the stock exchange 
to protect securities transactors. 
  A strong, regulated securities market with a high degree of 
efficiency, transparency, and absorptive capacity must be 
created if it is desired to channel national savings into 
investment in securities. This is especially essential in view 
of the decision to offer for sale, to the public and small 
savers, some shares that the public business sector owns in 
companies in the governorates or in public-sector companies. 
Thus, measures are needed to upgrade the Cairo and Alexandria 
stock exchanges and to establish essential financial 
organizations. This will strengthen both of these markets' 
capacity to absorb the shares of public-sector companies that 
will be offered for sale to the public. 
  It should be noted that disposal through the sale of all or 
some of these shares will achieve privatization while allowing 
the relevant companies to continue enjoying their status as 
legal persons. The disposal will be limited to the transfer of 
the ownership of these companies' shares wholly or partially--49 
percent or more--to the private sector by offering the shares 
for sale on the stock market and through securities brokers or 
brokerage companies to be established under the Capital Market 
Law No. 95 of 1992 and its implementing regulations. 
  Justice Mahmud Fahmi concludes by saying that the 
liberalization of Egypt's economy and economic reform--through 
the use of a multiplicity of tools, whether legislative or the 
improvement of the legal frameworks in which investment projects 
of the private sector, investment sector, or public business 
sector operate--cannot succeed in improving national economic 
performance as hoped, unless they are accompanied by the 
strengthening of the capital market in its broad sense, i.e., in 
its capacity as a money market, capital market, and a securities 
market. 
  Therefore, the government initiated measures to improve the 
performance of the money market and the capital market, and it 
issued Law No. 95 of 1992 on 22 June 1992. 
<H5>  Numerous Types of Bonds </H5>
  Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, a former economic minister and the 
chairman of the Arab International Banking Corporation, believes 
that numerous factors play a role in stimulating the capital 
market. These factors relate to making investors aware of the 
benefit of investing through securities transactions. They also 
related to the securities themselves. 
  There are more than 20 types of instruments, i.e., stocks 
and 
bonds, traded in the world's stock markets. There are nominal 
shares, fully-paid shares, preference shares, limited-term 
capital participation shares, bonds convertible into shares, and 
other types of stocks that are traded on international stock 
exchanges. 
<H5>  Integrated Measures and Policies </H5>
  Dr. Hamdi 'Abd-al-'Azim, dean of al-Sadat Administrative 
Sciences Academy-Tanta Branch, believes that the stimulation of 
the capital market can be accomplished through a package of 
policies, which must be integrated. This depends on the 
seriousness of economic liberalization policies in terms of 
promoting the private sector, granting some advantages and tax 
exemptions to securities, liberalizing foreign trade and the 
export of basic commodities such as cotton far from compulsory 
delivery, reactivating the ready-made goods exchange that 
existed in Alexandria before the revolution, reactivating the 
future contracts exchange, and developing an international 
communications network. 
  Attention should also be given to predictive studies and 
computer programs designed to generate forecasts and 
predictions, and to the gradual linkage of the stock market to 
international stock markets. 
  Also, the issuance of modestly valued treasury notes for 
purchase by individuals should be expanded, and the number of 
moneychanging companies should be increased.

<F P=106> [Article by Hasan al-Chalabi, chairman of Constitution </F>
Committee of Iraqi National Congress] 
  [Text] It is common knowledge that the Gulf war would not 
be considered over just with the liberation of Kuwait and the 
defeat of Saddam Husayn and his regime, but rather it will be 
considered over when the regime of Saddam Husayn is iradicated. 
This is because aggression under all laws, legislation, and 
customs does not end or stop by resisting the actions with which 
aggression was perpetrated, but rather by resisting the 
perpetrator, by punishing him, and by preventing him from 
repeating the crimes he committed. Therefore, in order for the 
punishment to be effectual the criminal must be apprehended. 
  Proponents of the strategy calling for Saddam's regime to 
stay in power say that this regime, having endured confrontation 
with storms, hurricanes, and earthquakes, while facing the 
blockade imposed on it for more than three years, has shown a 
unique ability to stand fast and to overcome difficulties. They 
say this calls for ending the boycott against him in order to 
resume economic and diplomatic relations with his regime. 
Advocates of this idea do not forget to bring up the subject of 
the danger of partitioning Iraq into a Kurdish state in the 
north, a Sunni state in the center, and a Shiite state in the 
south, that is in case the Baghdad regime were to cease to exist. 
  This strategy has undoubtedly scored some undeniable 
success. 
At the Security Council, Saddam's regime entered a new stage 
favorable to him after the Security Council welcomed Iraq's 
acceptance of Resolution 715. This resolution places all the 
civilian and military establishments and installations under UN 
observation and erects a system of constant monitoring and 
verification aimed at preventing the Iraqi regime from 
possessing prohibited weapons. Saddam Husayn has surprised the 
Security Council by accepting what he previously constantly 
rejected, speculating on the Security Council's reaction in 
order to see where this will lead. 
  This speculation is based on the evaluation of the positions 
of the Security Council members, the undercurrent of disputes 
between members of the international alliance in the Gulf war, 
particularly within the framework of the terms for lifting the 
oil ban on Iraq, and the quest for dialogue and normalization 
with Washington, which the Iraqi president is so anxious to 
realize. 
  If those who advocate keeping Saddam in power in Iraq, such 
as some Arab and European governments, oil companies, newspapers 
publishers, writers, and commentators, be they Arab or non-Arab, 
have achieved a measure of success--which is evident in bringing 
certain countries closer to accepting his [Saddam's] 
rehabilitation and reconciliation with him--those advocating his 
removal from power have also scored an undeniable measure of 
success in their strategy. 
  The Alliance, which the Iraqi National Congress [INC] has 
set 
up, is comprised of various races, communities, religions, 
political currents in the Iraqi opposition, including Kurds, 
Islamists, nationalists, democrats, and Marxists. The Alliance 
has been able to build a geographic, physical, and human base 
inside Iraq. This was something that the opposition had always 
lacked before this achievement was realized. This Alliance, 
represented by the INC, has also been able to establish a solid 
political and organizational structure having its own 
jurisdictions, powers, and authority--a step, the first of its 
kind that the Iraqi opposition adopted. The Alliance has also 
been able to gain a solid international ground, by virtue of the 
international and regional recognition it gained. Those who 
question its reality are only those who do not understand its 
significance and dimensions or those who want to mislead the 
people by distorting facts and obliterating them. 
  I do not understand why critics of the INC insist that one 
and all members of the opposition should join it so that unity 
can be achieved through it. It is known that in the principles 
of politics and law consensus that includes every individual is 
impossible, even in matters of jurisprudence, let alone in 
matters of politics. 
  The proponents of the strategy that seeks to get rid of 
Saddam are aware how skillful he is in cheating and misleading. 
Clause 22 of Resolution 687, to which he adheres, essentially 
consists of two elements. One is technical, contained in the 
report by the committee charged with ensuring the removal of 
weapons of mass destruction that the regime possesses, and the 
second is political, relating to the Security Council's being 
satisfied with what has been accomplished so far with regard to 
the destruction of the banned weapons. It also concerns making 
sure that [Saddam] will not again be able to possess such 
weapons in the future. Therefore, it is not imperative that the 
two elements be implemented in succession, whereby if the first 
is implemented then it follows that the second should be 
implemented too. This gives the Security Council the option of 
lifting the embargo on Saddam's regime, even if the committee 
concerned announces Saddam's compliance with the terms of the 
aforementioned clause, as its chairman Rolf Ekeus declared. 
[sentence as published] 
  It would have been far more equitable and right had the 
Security Council acted according to Chapter Seven, since it is 
empowered to do so by Resolutions 706 and 712, in order to force 
the Baghdad regime to pump its oil and sell it and allocate its 
revenues to meeting the people's basic needs for food and 
medicine under UN supervision, as provided for in the two 
resolutions in question. This would enable them to alleviate the 
crushing hardship the Iraqi people are suffering and, at the 
same time, prevent Saddam from once again utilizing the oil 
revenues, if restored to his control, for his evil purposes and 
reckless policy of subjugating the people and committing 
invasion and aggression. 
  In light of the efforts of the strategy seeking to maintain 
Saddam in office, it must be admitted that the counter-strategy 
seeking to remove him has scored brilliant successes in the 
international arena. The Iraqi opposition, as is known, has been 
able to win international support for its struggle. 
  This support sometimes has come from the United Nations and 
other times from influential international powers such as the 
United States and Britain. It is worth mentioning that UN 
support for the Iraqi people and Iraqi opposition in Resolution 
688 issued by the Security Council recognizes the Iraqi people's 
brave stand in the face of Saddam's regime, respecting its 
rights, and setting out methods that would change the Iraqi 
regime into a democratic regime respecting human rights. 
  The support and backing the influential international powers 
have given the Iraqi opposition in order to achieve its 
objectives of liberation and change has steadily increased since 
it has been able to organize its ranks and enhance them with 
cadres capable of undertaking serious work. This was realized at 
the Vienna meeting in late June 1992 under the INC banner. One 
of the expressions of strong support and backing that stand out 
is that of Vice President Al Gore who on 1 September l993 sent a 
message to the chairman of the INC Executive Council. (AL-HAYAH 
September 1993 issue no. 11161). 
  In this context President Bill Clinton said in his message 
to 
the House of Representatives and the Senate in late November 
1993 that the "only way for Iraq to return to the community of 
civilized nations is through the democratic process, respect for 
human rights, and adherence to the principles of international 
behavior." He added: "The Iraqi Government should represent all 
its people and abide by the integrity of its land and 
sovereignty." He expressed the belief that "the INC adheres to 
the objectives that would turn Iraq into a stabilizing force in 
the Gulf area." He noted that "setting up a no-fly zone in 
northern Iraq allows for monitoring of Iraq's compliance with 
Security Council Resolutions 687 and 688 and deters it from 
launching a major military assault in the area." 
  One might wonder of what use are these pledges and 
commitments, with the United States having defaulted on many of 
them, as it did in the recent case of Somalia. In order to 
further clarify this point we would say that the INC leadership 
is fully aware that international pledges and promises alone are 
not enough. Therefore, they must be examined in order to see how 
compatible they are with the interests of the party making them, 
so that if there is an imbalance or lack of balance between 
commitment on one hand and interest on the other, implementation 
of such commitment will falter and sometimes even fall as has 
actually happened in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Haiti. 
  It must be recognized therefore that there is a great and 
serious difference between the consequences of what happened in 
Iraq and the area around it and of what is happening in Somalia, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other parts of the world. When 
Saddam Husayn invaded Kuwait, the United States dispatched to 
the Gulf about 700,000 troops of allied forces with the latest 
equipment and technology and the deadliest weapons. The United 
States went ahead with fulfilling its commitments despite the 
very heavy burden they constituted. At the same time it has been 
unable or unwilling to send a few thousand troops to this or 
that trouble spot in the world. 
  It must be admitted that the importance of strategic 
locations in the world vary greatly and that the international 
vital interests in those areas vary greatly too. Therefore, the 
consequences of Saddam's aggression against Kuwait and the Gulf 
region security should be dealt with with the same firmness and 
effectiveness. Perhaps the interview THE NEW YORK TIMES 
published on 19 January 1993 with the permanent U.S. delegate to 
the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, in which she spoke about 
what she called new terms that President Clinton's 
administration is trying to impose on Iraq before the ban on its 
oil exports is lifted, corroborates what we said. 
  In the interview Albright said the new U.S. position calls 
for dealing with the question of sanctions in two stages. The 
first is that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the committee responsible 
for the Iraqi arms program, should testify that Baghdad has 
abandoned nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs in 
accordance with Resolution 687, and the second is that the 
committee should prove that it is capable of actual monitoring 
of the Iraqi industry in order to ensure that Iraq will not 
return to producing such weapons. Albright said: "We want a 
record proving compliance for a period of six to 12 months of 
continuous monitoring." 
  In the preamble of its Resolution 687, the Security Council 
has expressed its distrust in Saddam Husayn's regime, and this 
is the resolution Saddam Husayn has been using as an excuse for 
reconciliation and for lifting the seige. [as published] He has 
shown that he is unable to respect any treaty, agreement, or 
covenant that Iraq has signed or joined that aims at deterring 
him from committing more of such actions. His peaceful 
intentions are in dire need of being tested. He is in a state of 
continuous blatant violation of Resolution 688. So far he has 
failed to stop persecuting his own people and complying with 
methods provided in the resolution for this purpose, the aim of 
which is to end the dictatorial character of the Iraqi regime 
and establish democracy in its place. It is true that the 
resolution in question was not issued in accordance with Chapter 
Seven of the UN Charter, as in the case of other UN resolutions 
issued about the invasion of Kuwait and its consequences, but 
this does not in any way mean that it lacks the force of law. 
The resolution that was issued in accordance with Chapter Six of 
the UN Charter becomes binding when it is implemented, as in the 
case of setting up a no-fly zone and the security zone in 
northern Iraq and the no-fly zone in the south. 
  In light of the above, one can see how the attempts at 
reconciliation with the Saddam's regime have reached a dead end 
because this reconciliation calls for conditions and obligations 
that the present regime is unable to fulfill. First, it must be 
established that all weapons of mass destruction in his 
possession have been destroyed. Second, he should prove 
categorically that he will not again possess any such weapons 
now or in the future. Third, Saddam Husayn should finally and 
irrevocably respect Kuwait's sovereignty and regional security 
and accept the demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders as 
provided in Security Council Resolution 832. Finally, Saddam 
should stop repressing the Iraqi people and should comply with 
the provisions of Resolution 688 that calls for the 
establishment of democracy and respecting human rights in the 
country.

<F P=106> [Two-part article by Jum'ah Suhayl and Ziyad Tariq: "Opening </F>
of Symposium on Truth and Deception in Arab and Foreign Writings 
on Ultimate Battle (Mother of Battles)] 
<H5>  [3 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] The first annual symposium by the Ultimate Battle 
Research Center, held under the slogan of "Truth and Deception 
in Arab and Foreign Writings on the Ultimate Battle," was opened 
yesterday. 
<H5>  Center Director's Address </H5>
  Center Director Dr. Muhammad Muzaffar al-Adhami delivered an 
address in which he reviewed the importance of holding this 
symposium to the exchange of scientific opinions, analyses, and 
conclusions directly and far from the evil and tyrannical forces 
which have not been able, despite all the military, economic, 
and propaganda means they possess, to bend the Iraqi people's 
determination to march on the sound national and pan-Arab path. 
  Al-Adhami expressed the hope that the symposium will 
contribute, by offering the international thinking, something 
new to be added to what the world's authors and writers have 
written and published on the blockade and the deception. 
  He also reviewed the efforts made by the Ultimate Battle 
Research Center since it was founded six months ago to conduct 
and publish research and studies on the major historical 
confrontation, i.e., the Ultimate Battle. 
  In its first session, headed by Arab intellectual Muta' 
al-Safadi, the symposium discussed the issue of political 
domination. 
<H5>  Address by the First Session's Chairman </H5>
  Muta' al-Safadi, chairman of the first session, delivered an 
address in which he emphasized that many writers and authors who 
have written about the Ultimate Battle have not had the 
opportunity to communicate with each other and that this 
intellectual symposium is their opportunity to meet and 
strengthen their research and scientific relations and ties in 
order to expose the true dimensions of the aggression against 
Iraq. 
<H5>  Dr. 'Awdah Butrus' Address </H5>
  Dr. 'Awdah Butrus 'Awdah, the session's main speaker who is 
from the fraternal Jordan, stressed that the aggression against 
Iraq is just one part of the conspiracy. The blockade was 
imposed more than 40 months ago and the aggression scheme had 
been in place much earlier. If the Gulf crisis had not 
developed, they [imperialists] would have fabricated another 
crisis to attack the proud Iraq. 
  'Awdah added that the aggression targetted what no other war 
in history has ever targetted, noting that it started by 
destroying the infrastructure that had been built with the 
sacrifices of the great Iraqi people and their unique 
leadership, which had accomplished what no other world 
leadership had been able to accomplish. 
  Dr. 'Awdah wondered: Why did they disregard Security Council 
Resolution 660, which entrusted the Arab League with solving the 
Gulf crisis? Why did they reject everything urged by Iraq that 
had called for a peaceful settlement in accordance with the said 
resolution? 
  Concluding, 'Awdah said that Leader President Saddam Husayn 
is a historical necessity and that without his leadership, this 
steadfastness would not have existed, and "I greet this leader 
and symbol. I greet whoever has stood with him and I greet the 
great Iraqi people whose roots date back to more than 6,000 
years ago." 
  When the floor was opened for comments and debate, the first 
to speak was Ahmad Qamar, who said that there is currently Arab 
[official] domination of the Arab liberation movements and that 
the current struggle is a struggle between the Arab citizen and 
the Arab regime. 
<H5>  Dr. 'Abd-al-Ilah Maqziz </H5>
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Ilah Maqziz from Morocco said that the United 
States is not reluctant to threaten, even attack, any country 
that aspires to exercise independence in its territories. 
  Maqziz urged that the Arab liberation movement be revived 
and 
that meetings be sponsored to establish coordination between 
Arab political, labor, student, youth, and women's organizations 
so they will chart new strategies for Arab relations and will 
spell out the political movements' role in charting these 
policies. 
  Dr. Maqziz also stressed that it is necessary to launch a 
north-south dialogue through world liberation movements. 
<H5>  Dr. Muhammad Mahfuz </H5>
  Dr. Muhammad Mahfuz from Tunisia said that the new world 
order is still developing and has not been completed yet and 
that this order is nothing but some modifications and touches 
applied to the old system, which entrenched domination of the 
countries that triumphed in World War II, with some alterations 
introduced in light of the developments in the Soviet camp. 
  Mahfuz stressed that it is necessary to draft a new world 
order that is based on mutual respect and equal relations 
between countries and on democracy. 
<H5>  Dr. Sa'd Abu-Dayyah </H5>
  Dr. Sa'd Abu-Dayyah, from Jordan, wondered about the Arab 
regional order that was strong and influential in the 1950s 
because of the strength of the core countries. He said that the 
flaw is currently in the weak influence of the core countries. 
<H5>  Mrs. Hayah 'Atiyah </H5>
  Mrs. Hayah 'Atiyah, from Lebanon, urged that the Arab 
national liberation movement be revived on new bases, because 
the old basis has proved to be a failure. 
  Mrs. 'Atiyah stressed that it is essential to steer clear of 
emotional political rhetoric, to sponsor concerted meetings 
between Arab political organizations, and to devote attention to 
the citizen, because confronting domination begins with 
developing the citizen from within. 
<H5>  Writer Nawal 'Abbasi </H5>
  Mrs. Nawal 'Abbasi, from Jordan, said that what the United 
States has accomplished is to impose a peaceful solution for 
Palestine in the wake of the aggression that tried to weaken and 
contain Iraq. 
<H5>  Address by Writer Ahmad Muhammad al-Muslih </H5>
  Ahmad Muhammad al-Muslih, from Jordan, said that the current 
struggle is between the Arab citizen and some Arab regimes that 
fight this citizen under the canopy of various allegations and 
under the cover of pan-Arabism one time and of fundamentalist 
allegations another time. 
  Al-Muslih urged writers to pay attention to this important 
point, to exert efforts to deal with it in their writings, and 
to stress that the Ultimate Battle is an Iraqi act within a 
pan-Arabist framework--an act that has produced numerous 
positives for the Arab citizen. 
  Al-Muslih also urged that the pan-Arab plan be reinforced 
and 
that it be tackled with a new rhetoric. He urged that this 
underline the priorities in the pan-Arab struggle and point out 
the dangers that threaten the Arab nation, especially those 
dangers that are created by some Arab regimes. Al-Muslih pointed 
out that the United States is a well-known enemy of the Arabs. 
<H5>  Comment by Dr. Ayyub 'Abd-al-'Aziz </H5>
  In comment, Dr. Ayyub 'Abd-al-'Aziz said that political 
domination is based on economic domination and that what 
strengthens this political domination is the fact that Arab 
countries open their markets to foreign goods. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz urged that U.S. goods be boycotted and 
that 
efforts be made to break the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq and 
to achieve self-sufficiency with what is produced at the Arab 
level. He stressed that such achievements would make the United 
States realize the importance of unity of the Arab nation. 
<H5>  Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi </H5>
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, from Iraq, spoke about the 
roots of the U.S. domination, of the rise of this domination 
since disappearance of the Soviet Union, and of the emergence of 
the signs of a new world order which features a West-West 
struggle in place of the old East-West struggle. He also spoke 
of U.S. efforts to create a new order that features a 
North-South struggle. 
  Dr. al-Hashimi added that what goes on in the international 
arena is not a new world order, as Bush has depicted it to the 
world, but a labor that reflects how the future international 
conditions will be. 
  He noted that the United Nations has no credibility and is 
used against peoples' interests. He said that instead of being 
used for peoples' interests, UN law is being used against 
peoples' interests, adding that human rights have become a means 
to dominate peoples and strike their interests. 
  Dr. al-Hashimi stressed that a system that exploits man, 
fights peoples, and misleads the innocent is a system that has 
no right to speak of legitimacy and international laws. 
<H5>  Writer Sultan Hattab </H5>
  Sultan Hattab, a Jordanian who has written the book, 
Iraq, a Period on the First Line, called for 
abandoning the rhetoric of emotional political propaganda and 
for conveying the true conditions under which the Iraqi people 
live as a consequence of the unjust blockade. He also called for 
pointing out the main motives behind the U.S. aggression against 
Iraq, led by by the motive to dominate peoples' fates and to 
plunder their resources. 
  Hattab also called for embracing the truth with all its 
particulars and for familiarizing the world with the true nature 
of the hardship, injustice, tyranny, and death caused by this 
blockade, which is imposed by the United States and its allies 
to spread their control and domination over the region. 
<H5>  Professor Singh </H5>
  Professor Behemen Singh greeted President Saddam Husayn and 
the Iraqi people who, by confronting the imperialist-Zionist 
domination, have become a symbol of pride for the Third World 
countries. 
  Singh noted that 800 million Indians harbor love for leader 
Saddam Husayn and for the Iraqi people and that they are proud 
of Iraq, the land of love and peace and the Third World 
countries' front trench in confronting the imperialist onslaught. 
  He added that those who claim to be defending human rights 
are the ones who violate human rights with their continued 
economic sanctions against the Iraqi people--sanctions that lead 
to the death of children and that deny them milk and drugs. 
  Singh warned that future generations will learn the truth 
about submission to imperialism and will not forgive the present 
generations if they fail to take serious steps to confront 
imperialism and to support Iraq's position and its resistance to 
aggression. 
  He noted that the United States, through its past and 
present 
policies and through its presence in the Gulf Emirates, seeks to 
control the region and all Asian countries, including India and 
Pakistan. 
<H5>  Dr. 'Abdallah </H5>
  Dr. 'Abdallah, a Moroccan author who has written the book, 
Papers from the Gulf War, stressed the importance of 
the Iraqi experience in confronting and challenging the Arab 
nation's enemies. 
  He said that no international situation has demonstrated the 
ability to stand fast and confront the way Iraq has demonstrated 
this ability. Dr. 'Abdallah added that political domination 
vacillates, thus making it easy for new concepts to develop in 
the Western inclinations and tendencies and for controversy to 
develop within the West over the domination issue. 
<H5>  Muhammad Sharif al-Jayyusi </H5>
  Muhammad Sharif al-Jayyusi, from Jordan, noted that Iraq's 
accomplishments have been made not just in record time but in a 
unique and rarely equaled manner. 
  Al-Jayyusi stressed that we need a new intellectual and 
information rhetoric that sees the picture with all its 
particulars and that works for whatever serves the nation. 
  He noted that the objective of the aggression against Iraq 
is 
to contain the Arab revival plan emerging in Iraq. 
<H5>  Writer 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-'Ayyadi </H5>
  Writer 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-'Ayyadi, from Morocco, said that the 
imperialist United States seeks to depict itself as a system 
that has its principled and legal bases and that this is its 
attempt to entrench the so-called new world order which has not 
gained legitimacy in the minds of peoples. Therefore, it is an 
order faced with the threat of elimination. 
  Al-'Ayyadi reviewed the most significant allegations 
promoted 
by some information and propaganda media and some intellectuals 
who revolve within the imperialist orbit. All of these parties 
promote the world order in the areas of human rights, 
civilization, tolerance of the Zionist entity, and the slogan of 
internationalism so as to obliterate our Arab identity. 
<H5>  Major Diwati </H5>
  Major Diwati, a Pakistani military writer and analyst, said 
that President Saddam Husayn and the Iraqi people have triumphed 
and won the battle against the imperialist enemy, led by the 
United States. 
  He said the allegation by the United States and its allies 
that they won the battle is false and untrue. 
  Major Diwati said that the Pakistani people are proud of and 
harbor utter love for the valiant Iraqi people who have been 
able to confront barbaric domination by the United States and by 
its Western allies. He noted that Iraq, the land of sanctities 
and faith, represents now a symbol of not just Arab 
steadfastness but also of the steadfastness of all Third World 
countries. 
  Major Diwati asserted that the Iraqi victory was actually 
achieved under the leadership of President Saddam Husayn when 
his excellency and his brave army were able to protect the Iraqi 
people and their humane principles and to defend the principles 
of Islam and peoples' rights to independence and 
self-determination. 
<H5>  Writer Mustafa al-'Utum </H5>
  Writer Mustafa al-'Utum, a Jordanian who wrote the book, 
The Gulf War, Why? pointed out that the main mission 
with which we must emerge is to eliminate the division that the 
Arab nation is experiencing and that was left behind by 
colonialism. A cure must be found for this division so the 
nation will rise and confront the major threats that seek to 
eliminate and obliterate it and to seize its rights. 
<H5>  Talal Rashid </H5>
  Talal Rashid, from [Yemen's] AL-YAMAN AL-SA'ID, said that 
the 
plots that target Yemen's unity are the same plots that target 
the brave Iraq. 
  Rashid noted that numerous Arab forces, such as Saudi Arabia 
and Kuwait, are nurturing secession anew. This is in addition to 
Saudi pressures to delineate the border and to devour the Yemeni 
territories of Najran and 'Asir. 
<H5>  Sayyid Nassar </H5>
  Sayyid Nassar, from Egypt, asserted that the allegations 
used 
by the United States to attack Iraq are false and that the true 
motives behind the aggression were to stem Iraq's development 
and to end its pan-Arabist tendency, because Iraq had become the 
nation's center of luminescence, having managed to establish 
military balance in the region. 
  Nassar noted that the Iraqi people's struggle represents an 
extension of the Arab people's struggle against colonialist 
domination and against the division imposed by the alliance 
countries after World War II. 
<H5>  Mohamed Hafez </H5>
  Mohamed Hafez Ould Mohamed Lemine, from Mauritania, stressed 
that the U.S. anti-Arab schemes are not new because the Arab 
nation represents a threat to the aggressive objectives of the 
United States and the colonialist countries. Iraq in particular 
is the main threat because of the revivalist tendencies embraced 
by the Iraqi leadership, most significant of which are the 
tendencies to embrace scientific technology, to revive the 
pan-Arabist fleeing, and to liberate Palestine. These are 
mainstays that lead to the Arab nation's revival and that, 
consequently, represent a major threat to the U.S. and 
colonialist interests. 
<H5>  Sharifah Bint 'Amarah </H5>
  Mrs. Sharifah Bint 'Amarah, from Tunisia, asserted that the 
Ultimate Battle is the biggest cultural and social challenge 
confronted by Iraq and that this battle continues to be the 
greatest and most magnificent symphony for the persecuted in the 
world. 
  Bint 'Amarah appealed to all organizations, governments, and 
capable people in the world to advertise the inhumane hardship 
experienced by the Iraqi people as a result of the tyrannical 
blockade imposed on Iraq. 
<H5>  Mrs. Nasirah al-Sa'dun </H5>
  The final speaker at the first session was Mrs. Nasirah 
al-Sa'dun, the symposium rapporteur. She reviewed the focal 
points with which the speakers dealt in their addresses, 
analyses, scientific conclusions, and their proposals on how to 
foil U.S. plans to dominate the area; to develop the best forms 
of Arab struggle; and to create serious formulas of support that 
contribute to breaking the blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  The symposium was attended by Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, the 
minister of culture and information; Humam 'Abd-al-Khaliq, the 
minister of higher education and scientific research, and a 
number of culture, information, and research officials. 
<H5>  [4 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] The symposium on truth and deception in Arab and 
foreign writings about the Ultimate Battle, sponsored by the 
Ultimate Battle Research Center at the Ministry of Culture and 
Information, resumed its activities for the second day yesterday. 
  The session, chaired by Muhammad Tahir Mahfuz, discussed the 
focal point of economic domination. The main speaker was Dr. 
'Abd-al-Ilah Balqaziz from Tunisia. In his study, Balqaziz said 
that the objectives charted by the United States for its 
aggression against Iraq are well-studied and well-known, and 
they seek to dominate and control all raw material resources. 
They have also targeted Iraq because it is a regional power. 
  Balqaziz called for further discussion of the proposals on 
fighting the U.S.-Western onslaught and on exploiting the 
contradictions within the Western camp in Europe intelligently 
and wisely. 
  He stressed that Iraq represents a central objective within 
the U.S. economic program because Iraq has aspired to accomplish 
a developmental economic program that seeks to build economic 
support bases under difficult conditions. He noted that the 
military intervention signifies nothing other than a response to 
the slogan of "Arab oil belongs to Arabs," which Iraq embraces. 
It also signifies an effort to disengage oil from Arabism to 
ensure the flow of oil to the United States. 
  Balqaziz added that the United States and its Western allies 
work to break up the Arab region anew on the basis of a Middle 
East principle; to eliminate the bond of Arabism from the 
region's fabric; to rearrange the region on a new basis; and to 
open gaps that have been blocked to date, especially with the 
Zionist entity. 
  When the floor was opened for comment and debate, the first 
to speak was Haroun Mohamed Said from Algeria. He stressed that 
the struggle that is expected to rage in the future is an 
economic and technological struggle. Whoever possesses wealth 
and strength will have to enter the struggle. Accordingly, the 
objectives of the aggression against Iraq were to destroy the 
country's infrastructure and to eliminate Iraq as an influential 
country in the world. 
  Said added that it is impossible for the United States to 
embody the concept of the new order unless it destroys the 
independent regimes that stand in its way, led by Iraq, Algeria, 
Libya, Sudan, and Yemen. This is why we find that all these 
regimes are besieged. All this is done in accordance with a 
precise strategy. 
  Said emphasized that the aggression was motivated mainly by 
the fact that the United States and its allies were aware of 
Iraq's cultural and technological revival. Thus, Iraq had to be 
destroyed before it could reach the safety shore, like Japan and 
Russia. It also had to be destroyed to force the advanced 
countries to stop dealing with Iraq. 
  Said urged that the recommendations expose the true nature 
of 
the U.S. strategic ambitions. He also urged that efforts be 
exerted to draft a counter-strategy to be adopted by the 
well-meaning people of the world. 
<H5>  Mr. Loc Van </H5>
  Mr. Loc Van, from the Netherlands, carried a message of love 
and sympathy for the struggling Iraqi people and pointed out the 
contradiction in the interests of the decision-making 
powers--interests that flow to the same end. 
  Loc Van asserted that the imperialists seek to exploit the 
principle of self-determination in order to break up some 
independent countries. This is what the United States is trying 
to do against Iraq's Central Government. 
<H5>  Dr. Muta' al-Safadi </H5>
  Dr. Muta' al-Safadi, from Lebanon, warned that political and 
economic domination have begun to emanate from media domination 
and from confiscating the citizen's vigilance and controlling 
this citizen in all kinds of ways. 
  Dr. al-Safadi added that every colonialist phase has been 
tied to an objective befitting the form of colonialism in that 
phase, and we have now reached the phase of the latest form of 
colonialism. This phase can be called the emerging form of 
colonization of the human mind. 
  He stressed that with the collapse of the rival polarizing 
power, the United States had to think of drafting a new formula 
and creating a new justification for economic domination. Even 
human rights have had to be mobilized to serve this objective of 
domination; to prevent any crossing of the red lines; and to 
continue to monopolize technology. 
  Dr. al-Safadi said that "Israel," Turkey, and Iran represent 
the firm belts that are (to take charge) of the new Middle East 
plan. As for Arab culture, it has been kept out of the plan. 
<H5>  Juan Carlos </H5>
  Juan Carlos, from Spain, said, "We have to convey the truth 
to the outside world now." He added that the economic problems 
experienced by the world are tantamount to a struggle between 
the North and the South. Carlos expressed the hope that the 
world will witness a new kind of relations that are founded on 
justice and equality. 
<H5>  Husayn 'Abd-al-Qadir Ballah </H5>
  Speakers included Husayn 'Abd-al-Qadir Ballah, from Sudan, 
who said that the motives behind the aggression against Iraq are 
economic colonialist motives that have been promoted in the Arab 
world to plant despair in the Arab citizen's soul and to force 
him to tie himself to colonialism. 
  Ballah added that colonists alleged that the lack of raw 
materials for industry in the Arab homeland made it unnecessary 
for Arabs to have industries, including a conversion industry. 
Meanwhile, we find that Japan has come to rival the advanced 
countries in various industries, even though Japan possesses no 
raw materials. Ballah stressed the need to exert efforts to 
break the accursed blockade imposed on Iraq and to establish a 
common Arab market. 
<H5>  Malik Mahmud </H5>
  Malik Mahmud said, "Our meeting here as authors, writers, 
and 
journalists is to study the war that was launched by the United 
States and its allies and the effects of that war on the 
post-war Iraq and Arab world." 
  Mahmud added, "This podium is very convenient and permits us 
to present our viewpoints to the west, especially to the U.S. 
people, and enables us to tell them what they have lost." 
  He stressed that this war was imposed for numerous reasons, 
some political and some economic. After the destruction and 
disintegration of the Soviet Union--a process that occurred 
gradually and led to destroying the foundations on which the 
world was based--the United States launched its endeavor to 
impose its control on the world, and it has actually begun to 
impose its control on countries rich with natural resources. The 
first stop has been Iraq, and the goal is to undermine the 
country and to control its oil resources. 
<H5>  Dr. Salih Mas'ud </H5>
  Dr. Salih Mas'ud, from Algeria, said that the United States 
began to plan for this situation before the military aggression 
against Iraq in order to subjugate Iraq to its will. But the 
opposite is what has happened. The U.S. aspirations were 
frustrated by Iraq's stance against the most ferocious military 
aggression. 
  Mas'ud added that the blow dealt Iraq by the United States 
and its lackeys and the blockade that continues to this day have 
not undermined the Iraqi people's defiant spirit. We have heard 
and seen the revival and the defiance in the restoration of what 
was destroyed by the aggression. The Iraqi people have 
accomplished this restoration in record time, even though they 
lack numerous raw materials as a result of the blockade. In this 
accomplishment, the Iraqi people rely on their intrinsic 
capabilities and their domestic resources. 
  Hyde Stevens, from Britain, said that there is similarity 
between the Iraqi people's issue and the issue of the Irish 
people who have been divided so their resources can be 
controlled. On the same basis, the West, led by Britain, has 
sought to partition the Arab homeland and to impose rulers who 
are tied to the West so they will ensure the continued flow of 
the Arab homeland's revenues to the West. 
  Stevens said the scenario applied in Ireland in the past is 
being applied to the letter in Iraq, considering that Iraq has 
been prohibited from exporting its oil and that there is an 
endeavor to divide it into three parts. 
  He added that the past path of hope and struggle cannot be 
separated from the future path of hope and struggle and that the 
struggle to foil the imperialist schemes must continue. Stevens 
called for confronting the unjust economic blockade imposed on 
Iraq and for foiling its malicious objectives of starving the 
Iraqi people. 
<H5>  Dr. Hayah 'Atiyah </H5>
  Dr. Hayah 'Atiyah said that when the "Gulf war" started, a 
French paper said, "Now, the war of secret agencies and the 
economic war have started." 
  In her address, Dr. 'Atiyah drew attention to the importance 
of water in the region and to the Zionist entity's endeavor to 
control the sources of Arab water in coordination with the West 
by drafting proposals and policies in this regard. 
  She noted that the Western media has even rejected Egypt's 
management of the Nile River basin states so as to deprive the 
nation of its capabilities in the area of water. 
  Dr. 'Atiyah called for laying down the foundations for a 
water research plan to counter the "Israeli" research plan 
concerning the region's water strategy. 
  She also urged a special type of Arab economic ideology be 
developed and that we proceed from this ideology to develop the 
Arab economy. 
  Mr. Orak, from Brazil, said, "We are very concerned about 
the 
imperialist domination exercised by the United States. We are 
also interested in putting an end to this domination, because we 
believe that the world lives nowadays under the dangers of this 
political and economic domination whose price is paid by 
mankind." 
  He added that the imperialists are responsible for the 
tragedies of World War I and that they were the cause for the 
rise of the fascism that led to the eruption of World War II. 
Yet, the imperialists displayed no great concern until socialism 
emerged and struggled to break the yoke of slavery. But despite 
all the socialist efforts, imperialism persisted in its efforts 
and plundered the natural resources of some countries, thus 
victimizing thousands of people and depriving numerous others of 
education. 
  Orak stressed that attention was focused on Iraq this time, 
especially after the Soviet Union had disappeared, and that the 
imperialists launched a campaign of terror against peoples, 
utilizing the disintegration of the socialist camp to implement 
their criminal scheme and to try to destroy numerous other 
peoples and states by sowing sedition within these peoples and 
states. 
  He noted that, with the end of the socialist camp, the 
United 
States tried to assume exclusive control of the world. The 
United States reflected its capabilities in an ugly manner in 
the war it launched against Iraq in order to exploit the oil 
resources. 
  Orak noted that no country other than Iraq could have stood 
fast in this armed confrontation and this war. He said that this 
steadfastness represented a unique model and that, at the same 
time, it was an indication of the advanced position Iraq had 
attained in military technology, which was the best among the 
region's countries. 
  He also said that the United States persists in its moves 
against Third World countries and that this dictates that these 
countries move promptly to destroy the monopolist companies that 
have been used by the United States to loot and plunder their 
wealth. Crushing crises are experienced by many of these 
countries where youth suffer from unemployment and 
disintegration. 
  Concluding his address, Orak said that the Ultimate Battle 
has made clear the peoples' rejection of Bush's policy and that 
they have resisted this policy, as they resisted the World War 
II policy. The age when weapons were the only language has gone, 
and the age of the economic weapon has arrived, and the United 
States has begun to use this weapon to stifle peoples. 
  In a comment he made at the end of the session, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Ilah Balqaziz called for exerting greater and more 
profound efforts to draft a new strategy. 
  He said that we need a long-term policy to confront the 
consequences and results of this domination of our resources and 
of our pan-Arab future. He added that this policy should be a 
phased three-part policy, with each part devoted exclusively to 
a policy befitting the nature of the tasks dictated by this 
phase of history, namely the tasks of positive adaptation, 
mutual reliance, and self-reliance. 
  Balqaziz also urged that we read the international 
developments bulletin and that we take the position we need to 
take, i.e., open up to the world powers and exploit the 
contradictions existing among them. He especially urged that we 
open up to Japan and Germany, because they are the two strong 
candidates that are likely to play an important role in coming 
years, particularly since there are no bloody precedents in the 
relations the two sides. 
  He added that an economic relationship between the Arab 
homeland on the one hand and Japan and Germany and the other is 
likely to weaken the United States and its octopus-like grip on 
the Arab economy. 
  Balqaziz stressed that this strategy should not stop us from 
proposing a new and alternate strategy that makes us turn our 
eyes southward and maintain our ability to survive through new 
regional cooperation--a strategy that enables us to restore 
relations with the neighboring Islamic countries and with major 
economic forces, such as China and India and their major 
economic capabilities, so we can achieve minimal 
self-sufficiency. 
<H5>  Dr. 'Isam Rashid Huwaysh </H5>
  Dr. 'Isam Rashid Huwaysh, from Iraq, then talked about the 
forms of economic domination imposed by the United States 
through UN resolutions, which are used as an instrument to 
attain this domination and to then extend it over the southern 
countries and the developing countries. 
  Salah al-Mukhtar, from Iraq, stressed in his address that 
the 
Ultimate Battle succeeded in excluding Iraq's oil resources from 
U.S. control and, consequently, in preserving Iraq's oil 
independence and preventing Europe and Japan's economies from 
being subjected to U.S. pressures. 
  He noted that since the Ultimate Battle, the Iraqi model of 
restoring what was destroyed by the aggressors is different from 
the world's models after World War II, because the Iraqi model 
has not relied on any other experience. Unlike the ban imposed 
on Germany and Japan after World War II, which was a 
technological ban only, the ban imposed on Iraq covers all areas. 
  At the conclusion of the session, Mrs. Nasirah al-Sa'dun 
reviewed briefly all the points raised by the speakers about the 
focal issue of economic domination. Among other things, the 
speakers stressed the need to develop a strategy to counter the 
U.S. strategy and to achieve independent development which 
brings about self-sufficiency. They also discussed the link 
between economic domination and media domination--a link whose 
presence one concluded from the Ultimate battle--and about the 
effects of the war on Iraq and the world. The speakers also 
stressed that Iraq represents a model of the new defiance. They 
called, moreover, for conducting a study on water in the Arab 
homeland. 
  The session was attended by Culture and Information Minister 
Hamid Yusuf Hammadi. 
[Box p 4] 
  Yesterday, the delegations participating in the activities 
of 
the symposium on truth and deception in the Ultimate Battle 
visited the Steadfastness and Defiance Museum in al-Qishlah, 
Baghdad. 
  The delegations saw photographs of the comprehensive 
devastation caused by the tyrannical 30-country aggression--an 
aggression which touched the infrastructure and all economic 
facilities, places of worship, and residential buildings. 
  The delegations also saw photographs and miniatures of the 
various phases of rebuilding that was destroyed by the evil 
aggressors and of the efforts made by the reconstruction 
strugglers in Iraq's counter-attack and great response to the 
aggression.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Imanu'el Sivan: "The Myth of the `Children of </F>
Israel'"] 
  [Text] One Friday about two years ago, Shaykh Bassam Jarar, 
a popular preacher and a leader of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] on the West Bank, stood up and gave a sermon in the 
mosque in al-Birah. As is the custom, he chose a passage from 
the Koran, this time the first passage of Chapter (Sura) 2. 
  In this chapter, the prophet Muhammad blasts the "Children 
of 
Israel" for being a stiffnecked people with uncircumcised 
hearts, as Moses already told them in his time, a people that 
breaks covenants, a faithless and treacherous child. These 
things are proven, the Koran says, by the events of the golden 
calf and the rebellion of Korah, and later by the persecution of 
many of the prophets. These characteristics are deeply engraved 
in the Jewish character. 
  Muhammad goes on to say that he learned this to his 
detriment 
when the pact between the Jewish tribes and the Muslim community 
in the city of Medina in the Arabian peninsula collapsed, when 
those tribes did not live up to their commitments. 
  Thus far, the sacred text. And Bassam Jarar adds: "and is 
this not just the way we know them in Palestine: a harsh and 
devious people, with hearts of stone, cunning and cruel--and 
when it comes down to it, there is no difference between an 
Oriental Jew or an Ashkenazi." 
  These words are on an audiocassette circulating widely in 
the 
territories, and cassettes by other preachers from the Arab 
countries, some sold even in Israel, say very similar things. 
They pass on, in fluent language and to a large audience, the 
array of images (myths) that Islam has built up about the Jews 
since its dawn. 
  Two acquaintances of mine, both moderate men, one from east 
Jerusalem and the other from Gaza, told me that they sat with a 
group last week and listened to Egyptian tapes of commentary on 
Chapter 2 of the Koran, and found it "amazingly relevant, really 
speaking to our day." And indeed, about the cruelty of that 
thick-bearded man wearing the yarmelke and carrying the gun--the 
stereotypical character from the Arab cartoons of Jews in 
general and settlers in particular--there is no argument; and 
slyness, he demonstrated in the way he slipped into "Isaac Hall." 
  But is it really just him? When they preach about the 
details 
of the incident from the viewpoint of that second chapter, it 
becomes clear to the Muslim believer that slyness and treachery 
are something all Israelis have in common. As though by chance, 
say Palestinians in a style reminiscent of "Hagashash Hahiver"; 
as though by chance, half the guards were missing that morning; 
as though by chance, the metal detectors were not working 
precisely then; as though by chance, the closed circuit TV was 
not covering all the halls of the cave that morning; as though 
by chance, the guards who were there did not notice the murderer 
slipping into the Muslim prayer area; as though by chance, the 
General Security Service [GSS] did not warn of a possible attack 
by Kach extremists, and did not sound the alarm that the Cave of 
Makhpela was a potential target of attacks by Jewish opponents 
of the Rabin-'Arafat agreement. 
  The Palestinians are all the more suspicious because two 
groups are involved here: the border police and the GSS, both 
part of the unholy trinity, as Hamas calls it, which keeps the 
residents of the territories in a state of fear (the third group 
is undercover agents disguised as Arabs). "This typical Jewish 
way of breaking their word" was what led to the horrible event 
that has already taken its place in the Palestinian and Muslim 
pantheon of horrors next to Dayr Yasin, Kfar Qasim, Sabra, and 
Shatila. In those cases, too, a Muslim will claim, the two-faced 
Jews had no shortage of excuses: in Dayr Yasin, it was the work 
of the rejectionist groups; in Kafr Qasim, the muttered words 
"Allah Yirhamu" were taken as a clear command to kill peaceful 
citizens; in Sabra and Shatila, the Christian phalangists were 
the ones who committed the massacre. 
  All this comes to teach us the seriousness of the incident, 
and the broader context of which it is part. But as philosopher 
Karl Popper said, human reality is surrounded by plastic hoops; 
it is limited, but yet still has a measure of flexibility. That 
is, basic data (economic, demographic, technological, and even 
mental, such as the Muslim myths about the Jews) determine the 
framework that binds and distincetly limits the range of 
possibilities open to human societies. But man is a creature of 
reason and understanding and has certain degrees of freedom and 
flexibility. He can maneuver the range of possibilities he is 
given, and more than just once even break past it and turn it on 
its head. 
  Clearly, to really use this potential to the fullest, the 
opportunities must be there, but also, and especially, there 
must be leaders who will guide society so that it can make the 
most of the opportunities and get beyond the "plastic hoops." 
The unforgettable example of this was the Sadat initiative. 
Sadat took advantage of the "window of opportunity" that had 
been created by the stalemate in the 1973 war, and by American 
patronage in the detente era, thatled to peace with that very 
same Jewish people whose stubbornness and treachery he and his 
predecessor 'Abd-al-Nasir had said so much about. 
  Menahem Begin, who proved a fitting partner for the Egyptian 
president, caught the ball in the air, returned the gesture 
quickly and easily, and at the end of a process filled with 
pitfalls, proved that Israel was capable of keeping its signed 
commitments and withdrawing from Sinai and its settlements by 
the appointed time. The historically negative image of "the 
Children of Israel" was dealt a heavy blow, at least in the eyes 
of the Egyptian leader and most of his people. And though 
sinkholes still exist, the Muslim opposition in Egypt is no 
longer as capable as it once of profiting politically from this 
image. 
  More and more contact with reality seems to be able to 
change 
group perceptions; and it is all the more likely, when there is 
a strong motivation to let this happen. Such a motivation does 
exist among the Palestinian public, as Hamas itself admits: 
tired from years of intifadah that caused loss of life for some, 
and bodily harm and loss of freedom for others, continuous 
interruption of the processes of normal life, damage to the 
standard of living (because of commercial strikes, the closure, 
lack of investment). And beside these motives, there is also 
this positive side--that modest hope that burst into sight in 
the Palestinians' spontaneous demonstrations in the streets in 
the middle of September. 
  Though our legal advisers say that: "90 percent of the work 
of formulating the agreements is still before us," it is 
imperative to finalize immediately the details of putting the 
Rabin-'Arafat agreement into effect without quibbling over petty 
details (like symbols of sovereignty). And on the only subject 
still on the agenda, i.e., "tariff envelope," is it not 
possible, with no other choices, to agree to start with a 
complete separation of the two economies, and afterwards 
negotiate a gradual and mutual opening up, until the point is 
reached where both sides are comfortable? 
  This is, as the "nationalist" commentators say, the only 
Jewish and only moral response to the Hebron massacre--swift 
signing of the application agreement, and withdrawal of forces 
within weeks once it is signed. A step like this would offset 
the influence of the bloodbath a little, even though the scars 
will not heal soon. 
  Gestures like freeing more prisoners or opening PLO offices 
will do no more than dull the pain. Only carrying out the Oslo 
agreement in the field will renew faith in the political 
process, will not in any way crush the stereotype of the 
treacherous Jew, but it will take out a bite out of it in a 
practical way. 
  The "plastic hoops" of the world of myth were tightened 
around us by the murderer from Qiryat Arba', but it is still 
possible to heal them and regain our freedom of action. In spite 
of everything, the historic conjuncture is still shining its 
light on the peace process.

<F P=106> [Article by Gid'on Spiro: "The Acquiescence in the Evil"] </F>
  [Text] The testimony that has so far been heard by the 
Shemgar Committee has proved again that there are no miracles 
among the Jews. What obtains all over the world is true here as 
well: there is no wise conquering army. And an army that is not 
intelligent seizes upon the unfortunate guard at the gate as 
upon a life preserver. There is no alternative, it is necessary 
to return to the basic truth, that so many in Israeli society 
have been trying for years to repress: the seeds of the violence 
were sown on the seventh day of the Six-Day War. That was the 
beginning of the dunghill of the conquest. The caravan of the 
conquest galloped forwards, with arrogance and hutzpa, first 
under the leadership of the Labor Movement, and afterwards by 
the crushing steamroller of the Likud. One of the rotten fruits 
of the conquest is the settlements. They were and remain the 
watershed that separates the solution of the conflict and its 
perpetuation. 
  That which occurred in the State of Israel during 27 years 
of 
conquest is a known process, which was diagnosed among the 
German people in the transition period from the democratic 
Weimar Republic to the tyranny of the Third Reich. Professor 
'Amos Funkstein, who holds the chair for the History and 
Philosophy of the Sciences and Ideas at Tel Aviv University, 
said in a newspaper interview: "Between 1933 and 1937, up to 
Kristallnacht, the situation of the German Jews was better, from 
several aspects, than that of the Arabs of the 
territories...legal approaches were more open to the German Jews 
than to the residents of the territories" (HA'ARETZ, 9 December 
1988). The reference, of course, is to the first stages of the 
Third Reich, in the 1930's, long before the outbreak of the war 
and the establishing of the extermination camps. That was the 
stage in which good persons, who were not Nazis, acquiesced in a 
reality of racism and violation of human rights, became 
accustomed to it, and found themselves serving it, some out of 
loyalty "to the people and to the state," some out of 
conformism, some out of fear and calculation. From here, it was 
a short road to animalization and insensibility of writers, 
musicians, academics, judges, attorneys, actors, and others. The 
poison was absorbed in all systems of the society. 
  That is what happened in Israel, as well, "the only 
democracy 
in the Middle East." But in Israel, in contrast to the first 
stages of Germany in the 1930's, the blade of massive and 
arbitrary arrests was not placed on the neck of the citizens and 
there was no fear of a secret police that was liable to burst 
into homes at midnight. The collaboration with the conquest was 
generally done voluntarily in Israel. The willingness of most of 
the Israeli elite to cooperate with the conquest over time 
created a conceptual confusion, the apartheid reality, the 
acquiescence in the evil. 
  It is expressed in the professors at the Hebrew University 
continuing with their researches and their academic lives as 
usual, at the same time that at a distance of five minutes from 
them they closed universities, sent professors and students to 
administrative detention and shot at them with live ammunition. 
It happened to attorneys who agreed to serve as judges in 
military courts and in that way turned overnight from defenders 
of the rights of the accused into abusers of human rights and 
servants of an oppressive system. It happened to physicians who 
forgot their oaths and gave daily approvals, either by closing 
their eyes or by direct support, to a terrible system of 
tortures. Many harsh testimonies about cooperation with the 
conquest authorities by Israeli physicians, who served in the 
conquered territories on reserve and regular duty, were 
uncovered at an international convention that was held in ZOA 
House in Tel Aviv under the auspices of the association of 
Israeli-Palestinians Physicians for Human Rights (It seems to me 
that DAVAR was the newspaper that first revealed the existence 
of that IDF [Israel Defense Forces] form in which a doctor 
confirms the ability of an interogatee to undergo torture). It 
is self-evident that this happened to reserve soldiers, who in 
crossing the Green Line became conquerors harassing a civilian 
population, sometimes maliciously and with astonishing cruelty. 
Given all this, there is no reason to be amazed at orders on 
opening fire that discriminate between rulers and ruled. 
  Barukh Goldstein is not a sole lunatic, and it is impossible 
to define him as a wild outgrowth of a Jewish Hamas. Barukh 
Goldstein lived in Qiryat Arba, with the support of the secular 
State of Israel. All the military might of the Israeli conquest 
power was spread over him. He was part of the conquest army, 
received uniforms and weapons from the secular military 
establishment, was not denounced and was not expelled from the 
system when he refused, during the Lebanon War, to treat a 
wounded Arab. He enjoyed full backing from the governments of 
Israel over the years. 
  If we adopt the principles of the Cohen Committee about 
indirect responsibility, then many of the "leaders" in Israeli 
society--in politics, in academe, in arts, in all of the 
intellectual frameworks--bear indirect responsibility for the 
atrocities of the conquest. The decision of the Israeli 
government to forbid the political activities of the Kahanist 
movements, and the administrative detention of several of the 
activists, not only are inconsistent with proper administration 
of a democratic state, but it is also doubtful whether they are 
especially effective. As long as they are surrounded by a 
sympathetic political environment in the form of the 
settlements, Gush Emunim, parties such as "Tsomet", "Moledet", 
and the militant parts of the Likud, the Kahanist cancer will 
continue to send out its satellites to additional parts of the 
body. It must be admitted that there is no essential difference 
between a "legitimate" racist such as MK [member of Knesset] 
Yehosu'a Matz'a, for example, or the former MK Ge'ula Cohen, and 
the "new" terrorists Tiran Polak or No'am Federman. As it is no 
coincidence that the administrative detainee for several days, 
the president of the State of Judaea, Ben Horin, was previously 
an active member of "Kach" and today he is a member of "Tsomet". 
It is a natural transition within the family. 
  These words have very practical implications. Whoever 
supported at one level or another the conquest and the 
settlements may say today: I thought that conqueror and 
conquered can live in harmony. I found that this is not 
feasible. Therefore, in order to break the bloody circle, I 
(please enter the appropriate name) support the removal of the 
settlements. It is not yet late.

<F P=106> [Article by Shmue'l Katz: "The Israeli as </F>
/Schutzjuden/--Willingly"; passages within slantlines published 
in Latin] 
  [Text] One of the shocking phenomena in the history of the 
people of Israel in the exile was the /Schutzjuden/: the 
protected Jews. 
  The local leader, or the elector in the Germany of the Holy 
Roman Empire, took under his protection the Jewish community 
that was subject to him, or the Jews who sought to come to the 
area under his rule. They were completely undefended. In 
exchange for payment (in the form of taxes or other means) he 
would "ensure" their safety from anti-Semitic attacks. The 
result of existence at the bottom of the ladder, this dependence 
was one of the elements, at the same time both spiritual and 
physical, that the Zionists sought to uproot. 
  The shame of the /Schutzjuden/--whatever its form--was 
liquidated by a new generation of Jewish defense, which was 
founded at the beginning of the century in pogrom-stricken 
Czarist Russia. At that time, the Zionist pioneers in 
Eretz-Yisra'el established their "Hashomer." Thus arose the 
Jewish Brigades, which participated in the liberation of 
Eretz-Yisra'el from the Turks during World War I, a complete 
military tradition, that had slumbered for 1,800 years. 
Afterwards, it developed into armed resistance to the repressive 
rule of the British in Palestine; and it even flourished in the 
framework of the Israel Defence Forces--which is considered to 
be one of the best armies, if not the best army in the world. 
  Today, in 1993 [as in source], suddenly (as the agreement 
between Prime Minister Rabin and President Bush in exchange for 
the American guarantees was cooked up only last year) the 
independent Government of Israel has included in its plans the 
revival of the situation of the /Schutzjuden/. According to this 
plan, foreign soldiers will "protect" Jews in Israel. The logic 
is absurd. Its implication: /Schutzjuden/ not out of the 
necessity of tragic historical circumstances, but /Schutzjuden/ 
out of choice. A naturally proud and independent Jewish 
community is forced by its government into a situation of 
dependence. 
  No less shocking than the humiliation of morale and spirit 
inherent in the "peace with Syria" plan of the Rabin-Peres 
government is the lack of willpower and a line of thinking, 
which cannot withstand the critique of logic. The idea is that 
the Syrians will honor a peace treaty with Israel, if Israel 
relinquishes the Golan Heights. "Otherwise," so it is hinted, 
Syria will initiate a war. 
  As a purely military issue, these things are not logical. 
Syria's strategic position, opposite the Golan, is inferior 
relative to that of Israel. And, indeed, the Golan is the 
strongest natural factor of deterrence that the State of Israel 
has. For that reason, Syria has been careful to observe the 
territorial conditions of the supposed "separation of forces" 
agreement, which was reached after the Yom Kippur War in 1973, 
and which left Israel within sight of Damascus itself. 
  But the Israeli Government clarifies, before the entire 
world, that it is so frightened by the threats of war that it is 
willing to sacrifice its security in the north, and to hand over 
to Syria--and especially to the hands of the bloodthirsty tyrant 
and the hands of whoever will be his successors--the very key to 
that security. 
  And, indeed, we will be subject to the mercies of the 
Syrians, for when the security pearl of the Golan is in their 
hands--as they have declared--they will be able to decide that 
the time has come "for the final assault" on Israel, and then 
they will not hesitate to order the "promised" American forces 
to evacuate the area within 24 hours. Alternatively, if the 
American forces will resist, then the Syrians will attack them 
to an extent that will arouse the American public against the 
presence of their forces in the contested area, or Israel will 
be required to make additional concessions in order to prevent 
casualties among the Americans. 
  There will be a great justification for the American call 
for 
a withdrawal of forces, and it will be heard from all quarters, 
both from friends of Israel and from hostile parties. 
  From all quarters, with the same clarity as night follows 
day, it will be said: "If those Israelis, who could definitely 
have defended themselves, were so stupid as to relinquish 
territory to the Arabs who for two generations have been 
threatening and have twice tried to destroy them, why should the 
American youths risk their lives in order to defend them?" 
  More knowledgeable Americans will add that the Israeli 
Government agreed to relinquish the Golan Heights in exchange 
for the Americans' promise of guarantees--and that they could 
have taken care of it themselves for five years from Israeli 
resources--even if at higher interest cost, but without 
political obligations. Must American youths endanger their lives 
in order to defend Israelis from the consequences of their 
government's stupidity? 
  Moreover, Americans with a good memory will remember that 
the 
Israelis were always proud, and even insisted, that they did not 
want foreign soldiers to fight for them. 
  No, "the guarantees," if they are ever given, will evaporate 
(as happened in Sinai in 1967). 
  The feeling that the Americans will defend Jews has a 
special 
significance in light of the special affection that the American 
administration feels towards Syria. It is difficult to find a 
pragmatic reason for the treatment that the Syrian dictator 
receives. 
  In the political sphere, Syria has nothing special to offer: 
it is a poor country and lacks oil reserves. It has no 
ideological charm and it continues to decorate the list of 
countries that encourage terrorism. 
  But for years, especially since the days of President 
Carter, 
Syria has been spoiled and cultivated. Its interests were 
protected, even though they were illegitimate, and its crimes 
were swept under the carpet. Asad was the first foreign 
statesman that President Carter chose to meet in 1977. At that 
meeting, he said to Carter that Israel "must withdraw from all 
of the territories," etc., and added that Israel must allow the 
return of the refugees to Yaffo, Gaza, and Lod. Upon his return 
to the United States, Carter declared that Asad was "moderate." 
  This love affair continued during the Gulf war, during which 
Syria joined officially the coalition against Iraq but did not 
lift a finger in combat, it won a grant of $2 billion (which 
were allocated immediately to arms purchases). And when Syria 
purchased Scud missiles from North Korea, Washington warned 
Israel--the intended target of the missiles--not to stop the 
ship that was bringing them to their Syrian destination. 
  [Editorial note] Shmu'el Katz was the first commander of the 
IZL [National Military Organization--pre-1948 underground 
resistance organization. A former MK [member of Knesset], he has 
published a number of books on Zionist and Jewish history. He 
published recently a two-volume biography of Ze'ev Jabotinsky.

<F P=106> [Article by Anon: "Israeli Arabs Urinate on the 1947 </F>
Borders"] 
  [Text] It is as if a hidden hand drew this time the lines 
of the disturbances by the Arab citizens of Israel. As if 
someone gave the order to display violent rage on the line of 
the western Galilee, Nazareth, Wadi 'Ara, Tayybe, Yaffo (!), 
Ramle (a failed attempt), and, of course: the region of 
Be'er-Sheva. The known and recognized map of November 1947, and, 
to tell the absolute truth: it is also derived with not 
inconsiderable logic from the slogan "two states for two peoples 
in western Eretz-Yisra'el--if the reference is to complete 
equality after the completion of Stage 1, within the 1949 
borders. 
  "We are an inseparable part of the Muslim people and of the 
Palestinian people," said the mayor of Um-al-Faham, Ri'ad Salah, 
in eulogizing the "holy martyr" Abu-Gum'ah, who was killed in 
the rioting near Be'er-Sheva, and his bed was decorated with a 
Palestinian flag and the participants in the funeral (like all 
of the demonstrators in the disturbances throughout Israel) 
shouted: "With blood and fire we will liberate Palestine, with 
spirit and blood we will redeem the holy martyr." 
  There is no doubt that the rage and the pain of the Arabs of 
Israel over the slaughter of the members of their religion and 
their people in Hebron are authentic and independent of 
rebellious political motives, but the nature of "the popular 
uprising," which features demonstrations like this more and more 
(like several of those that preceded them), indicates in this 
manner that the event of Hebron was not the reason but the 
pretext, and that there is a guiding hand and that there are 
organized cells in the field, that are activating the masses. 
This is not yet an intifadah in the full sense of the word, only 
early rehearsals for what those who are staging it know to be 
careful not to do prematurely--but the time will yet come. 
  The spearhead of the liberation of Palestine is now located, 
from the political viewpoint and in accordance with reality, in 
"the West Bank." There is an early and a late stage in 
"process." But the seed of the Palestinian intifadah in Israel 
has already sprouted and is poking up from the ground, and who 
knows how many and which Israelis will yet participate in it, 
for 'Aziz and Haziz from "My Michael" of 'Amos 'Oz and "The 
Guardian of the Forests" of A.B. Yehoshu'a were created before 
the Six-Day War (and Hirbet Hiz'ah of S. Yizhar was born with 
the War of Independence). And the "new historians" are only 
recently publishing their researches and Mittelpunkt has only 
reached Gorodish, and "Second View" of the television has not 
yet finished with Jerusalem, and the demographers have not even 
begun yet to warn about the demographic weight that awaits the 
people of Israel, and "Peace Now" is only beginning to 
demonstrate for the evacuation now of the settlements. 
  So why should we complain about the organizers of the 
disturbances in Israel who satisfy themselves with urinating on 
the 1947 borders and go back to their lairs?

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Jamal 'Itabi from Jeddah: "17 </F>
Industrial Investment Opportunities Worth $490 Million in Saudi 
Arabia"] 
  [Text] The gross investment that is needed for 17 new 
opportunities for industrial production that are being offered 
in Saudi Arabia is nearly $490 million. The Gulf Organization 
for Industrial Investments has offered these 17 opportunities in 
cooperation with the Saudi Ministry of Industry and Electricity 
and the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  The list of proposed projects includes a project for the 
production of heat-formed steel blocks, with a gross investment 
(not counting land) of 888.9 million Saudi riyals [R] ($236.3 
million), with R822.4 million ($219.6 million) needed for 
machinery and assembly, R37.4 million ($10 million) in 
pre-production costs, and working capital amounting to R25.1 
million ($6.7 million), with a construction period of 30 months. 
  The project's profitability is estimated at a 22-percent 
average private return, 34-percent average private return on 
invested capital (for easy loans) and net present value (at an 
average 10-percent discount) of R861 million, or $230 million; 
an annual return on investment of 30 percent, an operating 
margin of 45 percent, annual operating profit of R219 million 
($58.5 million), and annual cash flow of R267.4 million ($71.4 
million). One million tons of steel blocks would be produced per 
year, on three daily shifts, over 330 days, which is the number 
of days of annual operation. Products would be sold in 
international markets, especially the Far East, Europe, America, 
and Canada, noting that the size of the local market is expected 
to reach 3 million tons by the year 2000, with export market 
volume to reach 100 million tons by the same year. 
  Another project will produce 200,000 tons of iron rolls. 
These would include finished elongated rolls, reinforced beams, 
and light sections, with gross investment (not counting land) of 
R353.2 million ($94.3 million), of which R265.7 million ($71 
million) is for machinery and assembly, R51.1 million ($4 
million) for buildings and civil installations, and R45.9 
million ($12.2 million) for pre-production costs. 
  Working capital is R26.5 million ($7.1 million), with 
construction time of 20 months, with project profitability of 
22-percent average private return, 26-percent average private 
return on invested capital (in case of loan), and net present 
value (at an average 10-percent discount) of R285 million ($76.1 
million), 25- to 29-percent annual return on investment, 
29-percent operating margin, R74.9 million ($20 million) annual 
operating profits, and R102.8 million ($27.5 million) in cash 
flow. 
  The project study defined the geographic marketing area as 
the Western Province of Saudi Arabia, which represents 95 
percent of sales, with 5 percent of sales for export markets on 
the basis of an estimate of the Western Province's market volume 
of more than 1 million tons per year. The proposed opportunities 
also include a project to produce 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene or ABS products, for the 
manufacture of high-quality and specialized products. Production 
would be about 30,000 tons per year: 10,000 tons of commercial 
products per year and 20,000 tons per year of specialized 
commercial products. Gross investments (not counting land) 
would be almost R261 million ($69.7 million), of which R222.5 
million ($59.4 million) would be for machinery and assembly, 
with a working capital of nearly R16.8 million ($4.5 million). 
Pre-production costs are R21.7 million ($5.8 million), with a 
construction period of 24 months. 
  The sale price per ton would be R5,868 ($1,567) per 
factory-delivered ton. Marketing operations would include the 
GCC states, which represent 63 percent of sales, with 37 percent 
going to international markets. The volume of the Gulf markets 
in this area was an annual 24,000 tons in 1991. 
  The other 14 projects include a project to produce 
high-efficiency dehumidifier units, with a gross investment 
(excluding land) of nearly R9.98 million ($2.67 million); a 
project for electric engine insulators, with a gross investment 
of nearly R1.02 million ($275,000); a project for polystyrene 
sheets for packaging and wrapping "tabak" [tobacco; as 
transliterated] at a cost of almost R2.03 million ($540,000); a 
project for the press-method manufacture of stainless steel 
products, costing $16.4 million; a project for the manufacture 
of steel castings products, with a gross investment cost 
(excluding land) of almost R74.1 million ($12.5 million). The 
list also includes a project producing plastic pellets for 
health use with a gross investment of nearly R28.5 million ($7.6 
million); a project to produce a rubber compound for covering 
the floors of flatbed trucks, with a gross investment of R21.7 
million ($5.8 million); a project producing paper pulp and paper 
from palm trees at a total cost of nearly R67.4 million ($18 
million); a project to produce synthetic diamonds for industrial 
uses, with an investment of R35.23 million ($9.41 million); a 
project for reinforced concrete bricks with a gross investment 
(excluding land) of 15.3 million ($4.1 million); a project to 
conform light aluminum products, with a gross investment of 
R11.32 million ($3.02 million); a project to produce flexible 
enamel-coated copper wire with a gross investment of nearly R4 
million ($1.1 million); and a project to produce products 
extracted from used motor oils with a gross investment 
(excluding land) of R28.7 million ($7.7 million). The final 
project produces complete sets for computer cleaning, with a 
gross investment (excluding land) of R2.14 million ($570,000).

<F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Idris in Jeddah: "Demand for Water in the </F>
Arabian Peninsula To Be 35 Billion Cubic Meters in the Year 
2010, 85% of That for Agriculture Sector"] 
  [Text] Dr. Muhammad Jalil 'Abd-al-Razzaq, head of the 
Science Department and Water Resources Administration in the 
College of Observation, Environmental Protection, and Dry Region 
Agriculture in King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University, has said that the 
agricultural sector in the Arabian peninsula is the largest 
consumer of water, with agriculture consuming 85 percent of the 
water. If people are educated and save water at a rate between 
10 and 20 percent, this would provide a large quantity of water 
to fill current and future water needs. He explained, in his 
lecture entitled "Water in the Arabian Peninsula: Opportunities 
and Challenges," which he delivered this month at the College of 
Engineering at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University in Jeddah, that 
rising consumption in the period 1980-1990 led to the depletion 
of groundwater in the shallow and deep strata. It caused a 
constant decline of the water level in valley sediments in most 
provinces of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates [UAE], Oman, 
and Yemen. The agricultural renaissance, especially in Saudi 
Arabia, the UAE, and Oman also led to the use of large 
quantities of groundwater, mostly from the deep strata. It is 
noteworthy that the quantities extracted from the deep strata, 
layered one over the other, and which cover vast areas of the 
Arabian peninsula, exceed many-times-over the quantities of 
(potable) water substituted for it. The extracted water was more 
than 10 times the amount of drinking water, which will lead to 
the large-scale depletion of water, if the small available 
quantity of surface water, ground water, desalinated water, and 
treated water is compared to the demand for water for various 
uses in all the countries of the Arabian peninsula. [sentence as 
published] This demand has increased from 6 billion cubic meters 
in 1980 to 22.5 billion cubic meters in 1990. It appears that 
the shortfall between available water and the demand for water 
was met with groundwater, especially from the deep strata. 
Additionally, in the same way, with the growth of agricultural 
activity in the countries of the Arabian peninsula, the improved 
standard of living and the increased population will lead to an 
increased demand for water, expected to reach 31.5 billion cubic 
meters in the year 2000, and 35.5 billion cubic meters by 2010, 
compared with the amount estimated for 1980, about 6 billion 
cubic meters. The agricultural sector's share of this water will 
be 26.5 billion cubic meters by the year 2000 and 29 billion 
cubic meters by 2010. In order to satisfy future water demand, 
additional desalination plants will have to be built and, to a 
large extent, groundwater will have to be depleted in all these 
countries, especially in the deep strata. Groundwater will reach 
25 billion cubic meters in the year 2000 and 28 billion cubic 
meters by the year 2010. 
  'Abd-al-Razzaq explained that there is a need to study 
alternative options for water sources in the Arabian peninsula, 
while taking social and economic factors into consideration. 
These alternatives may include a large degree of reliance on 
increasing use of high-quality groundwater for drinking, even if 
this water is located far from large population centers, instead 
of its present use for agricultural purposes. There should be 
work on increasing substitute (potable) quantities from the flow 
of floodwater and rain to the water-bearing strata close to the 
surface by using various substitute means and increasing use of 
treated water (healthy runoff) in agriculture, tree planting, 
and industry, as well as work on increasing quantities of 
surface water by "emulsifying" and "seeding" the clouds. This 
can be done in the southwest provinces of Saudi Arabia, and most 
parts of Yemen and southeastern Oman, while enacting awareness 
and educational programs for agricultural, household, and 
industrial consumption. These programs would be one of the 
permanent and ongoing programs for affected institutions in the 
water sector. 
  He pointed out that demand for desalinated water has grown 
by 
large degrees in the last 10 years, due to population growth, 
especially in the cities, and the improved standard of living 
for individuals. Production of desalinated water in 1990 was 
nearly 1.6 billion cubic meters from the stations located on the 
Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts, and is expected to reach 2.9 
billion cubic meters by the year 2000. This expensive water, 
without awareness, will serve to meet the water needs of the 
coastal cities, especially those on the Arabian Gulf coast, as 
the groundwater in this area is highly saline. 
  The lecturer shed light on the role of dams in developing 
water resources, indicating that 227 dams exist, most of them 
small, in the Arabian peninsula, of which 190 are in Saudi 
Arabia. He said that a large number of these dams are in western 
and southwestern Saudi Arabia, and that there are future plans 
to construct 77 dams in various parts of the Arabian peninsula 
in the near future. He said that the implementation of a program 
of integrated maintenance includes the elimination of alluvial 
sediment behind dams, or getting rid of it with appropriate 
engineering designs. It is also necessary to have advanced 
operating plans on sound scientific bases for the stock of 
surface water in the valleys' sedimentary strata, for use as 
needed. This would be an alternative to storing it behind the 
dams for long periods and losing it to evaporation. He added 
that the development of dams must be emphasized, and, in 
particular, study of the use of expandable dams to solve 
sedimentary problems by detouring runoff to agricultural lands 
located near valley streams. 'Abd-al-Razzaq mentioned that the 
deep strata that extend below a large part of the Arabian 
peninsula contain large amounts of water, but not to the degree 
that some think, that it cannot be depleted. The water collected 
in these strata over long periods of time, between 20-40,000 
years. He said that there was a big difference in the concept of 
water stock between these figures, which appeared in a study 
from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, and 
statistics from the previous five year plan, which illustrated 
studies carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water. 
The figures of the University of Petroleum and Minerals relies 
on an estimate of stored quantities in a total volume of strata 
at about 32 trillion cubic meters used a major factor in 
storage, which is open to doubt. This is apart from the variety 
of the water, while the quantities of stored water referred to 
in the previous plan were estimated at about 1.5 trillion cubic 
meters. This quantity can be pumped from these strata using 
available pumping technology. It would reduce the water level or 
water pressure to 300 meters below ground surface. It is 
difficult to pump water from great depths, given that some of 
the deep strata are located at depths of more than 1,500 meters 
below the ground surface; this water generally needs to be 
chilled and its quality improved. 
  He said that he estimates the stock of technically 
recoverable deep-strata groundwater at about 2.5 billion cubic 
meters, and that this stock should be conserved for future 
generations, for the use of groundwater in agricultural activity 
for food self-sufficiency, and especially the production of 
wheat for all the countries of the region, which encouraged 
agricultural development. Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq added that there 
are scientific and technical factors playing a significant role 
in the pumping of groundwater from the bowels of the earth, 
especially from the deep strata layered one over the other in 
the eastern Arabian peninsula. Constant, ongoing pumping leads 
to disturbances in the balance of water pressure in the confined 
strata, and the water leaks from stratum to stratum through 
cracks in them. Good-quality water mixes with non-potable water. 
The pumping process is extremely sensitive in areas located near 
the sea, as ongoing pumping may lead to the mingling of saline 
seawater with sweet groundwater, especially in the eastern 
Arabian peninsula. He said that it is important to create a 
program to educate and make people aware of water consumption in 
order to deal with the primary bases of building foundations, to 
monitor the assembly of equipment systems that provide large 
quantities of water, and the system of irrigation. 
  Specialized agencies dealing with standards and 
specifications have an important role to play, with standards 
for imported goods focused solely on water-supply appliances, 
and clarifying quantities supplied through these appliances and 
equipment. There was also the question of energy used to heat 
water. This was at a time when real estate loan funds, plentiful 
in most of the GCC states, could play an important role in this 
field. They could do this by giving financial incentives to 
borrowers who use water supply appliances in their homes. 
  Dr. Muhammad Jamil 'Abd-al-Razzaq said that all the 
countries 
of the region should prepare and update their short- and 
long-term water plans. There is a need for water legislation for 
various uses, to delimit demand for water and available sources 
until the year 2030; and there was a need for ongoing training 
at all levels, from the laborer to the director-general. 
  He spoke of the doubts that still exist about treated water 
and the possible presence of viruses. He said the possibility of 
using this water in agriculture and industry requires specific 
laws regarding the chemical and biological varieties of the 
water, in addition to specific laws for use, and ongoing 
monitoring to put an end to pollution of groundwater. He said 
that future water studies will require parallel studies on 
environmental impact and economic cost, as the wisest use of 
water in the future will require further detailed studies of 
groundwater, especially in the deep strata, to discover their 
hydraulic properties and the water type. Increased knowledge 
could aid in the development of an appropriate and comprehensive 
plan for the best use of water, especially in light of future 
growth. 
  For his part, Mr. Mustafa Nuri 'Uthman, Director of the 
Western Province Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Water, said, commenting on Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq's lecture, "There 
is natural water leakage between strata, and leakage that is the 
result of poor drilling. I would like to question the researcher 
about the figures he mentioned in his lecture. Are they 
estimates? On another front, we must choose between water 
security and food security. We want to drink, and we want to 
eat. Why are we thinking of the geologic aspects only, and 
ignoring society, which needs food, and the factories that 
require operation? Why doesn't he make a connection between soil 
and water and agriculture? As far as making people aware of 
consumption, why are we speaking of theoretical solutions? I am 
a practical man, and I want to listen to practical solutions 
that enable a man in his home or on his farm to use an awareness 
program spontaneously and quickly. The concept of awareness 
should be part of the school curriculum. We have a desert 
climate, and we must adapt ourselves and our children to the 
needs of this environment. I also find that trainers in the 
geological field join training programs only to get a promotion, 
and not to raise his scientific level." 
  Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Razzaq said, in response to Mr. Mustafa 
Nuri's question, that the lack of water usage statistics 
illustrating consumption in every city is the thing that has 
prevented any researcher from obtaining accurate information. 
"For that reason," he said, "we find that information on 
individual consumption is contradictory. Monitoring of 
inter-strata leakage resulting from the random drilling of wells 
requires a great deal of manpower so one can implement present 
codes in order to seize wells that violate them. Many of the 
wells can be dug in one night." 
  He explained that regarding the number he had mentioned for 
the consumption of treated water in 1992, 217 million cubic 
meters had been consumed in Saudi Arabia, and the rest in the 
other countries. On the awareness of consumption in line with a 
cultural program, he said that he supports that, just as he 
supports the need to consider food security by emphasizing 
agriculture in the water-rich provinces, or conserving this 
water for future generations. 
  On another front, Dr. 'Abd-al-Ghaffar Ba-Zuhayr, as 
submitted 
Dean of Graduate Study and Scientific Research in the College of 
Earth Science at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University said, commenting 
on the lecture, said that treated water in Saudi Arabia has not 
been given a chance; nor have factories and hospitals been 
required to use it for their needs other than human consumption. 
  Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Razzaq confirmed that there is a need 
for a detailed study of some of the strata that extend over 
large areas. In addition, all the wells that have been dug 
should be recorded. There is, he said, a suitable opportunity to 
obtain physical information from oil companies.

  [Text] Dubai--An economic study summed up the idea of 
establishing a free-trade zone in Saudi Arabia by confirming 
that hosting joint ventures in the free zone would best serve 
the developmental, economic, and social goals in the Kingdom. 
  The study, prepared by Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim Fu'ad Faris, 
economic advisor in the office of the Minister of State and 
Chief of the General Monitoring Bureau in Saudi Arabia, 
indicates that "hosting joint ventures in the free zone 
represents an important step toward gradually liberalizing 
production factors on scientific bases. It will also help 
indirectly to achieve economic integration among Arab countries 
or the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states." 
  He said in his study, published in the most recent issue of 
TA'AWUN [Cooperation], published by the Secretariat General of 
the GCC states, that "for the hosted projects to produce the 
desired results, the Kingdom would follow a selective policy 
with the aim of establishing a free industrial export zone, and 
not only a free port. Industries would be located there to help 
create new added value." 
  He indicated that supporters of establishing a free zone in 
Saudi Arabia hope it would achieve several objectives, such as 
diversifying the economic base and boosting the participation of 
the industrial sector in the GNP. Industry currently accounts 
for 10 percent of GNP, and oil accounts for more than 90 percent 
of the Kingdom's total exports, despite the remarkable 
development the petrochemical industry and other industries have 
achieved. The study noted that supporters of a free zone seek to 
encourage greater private sector participation, as an active 
free zone and the private sector's cash flow inside and outside 
the country offer the private sector investment opportunities to 
carry out its important role. The free zone can also help to 
transfer and develop usable technology to serve the needs of the 
Saudi economy. Proponents of the idea, according to the 
study, believe the free zone could increase the non-oil GNP 
growth rate by increasing demand for locally produced raw 
materials; stimulating exports of goods and services; reducing 
substitute imports; and using and training domestic labor. They 
also see the possibility of bringing home Saudi money abroad and 
attracting foreign capital, as well as helping to support the 
competitive ability of the industries the Kingom takes part in. 
Saudi Arabia's petrochemical production has trouble penetrating 
European markets, for example, because of taxes and other 
obstacles, negatively effecting the competitive ability of these 
industries. The establishment of joint ventures with other 
countries in the free zone would support these industries' 
competitive ability. 
  Dr. Faris believes that "the Kingdom should heed the example 
of other countries so that Saudi Arabia will not repeat their 
unsuccessful experiences with projects that were hastily 
implemented during the oil boom." He pointed out that "the idea 
of establishing a free zone must be founded on the basis of its 
own merits." 
  The study contained two propositions, one supporting the 
idea 
of establishing a free zone in the Kingdom, and the other not 
supporting it. It mentioned "that some of the encouraging 
factors that show the possibility of establishing a free port in 
the Kingdom are: Saudi Arabia's pursuance of a free economy 
policy; the volume and international standing of the Saudi 
economy, estimated at $50 billion annually; abundant capital and 
liquidity; and the excellent reputation and confidence the 
Kingdom enjoys in global financil circles, in addition to its 
political and economic stability." 
  Among the obstacles and negative aspects of the 
establishment 
of a free zone in the Kingdom are, according to statements not 
supporting the idea, the high cost. Despite the Kingdom's 
excellent infrastructure, the establishment of the zone would 
require the spending of large sums, possibly in excess of $10 
billion. The free zone in 'Jabal 'Ali, constructed in the late 
1970s, cost $2.5 billion, or the equivalent of $10 billion in 
1988 prices. 
  Besides that, free zones have failed to achieve their 
goals--such as the transfer of appropriate modern technology--in 
numerous countries. And free zones have social and political 
effects that, it is expected, Saudi society would reject. As to 
economic freedom in the Kingdom, some people believe the Saudi 
economy enjoys sufficient economic freedom, and that the 
establishment of a free zone might not add all that much to it. 
For another thing, free zones are not considered, from an 
economic standpoint, to be part of the host country. If there 
were a concession agreement between Saudi Arabia and another 
country as the first country's condition for custody, then the 
free zone's products might not benefit in this case, as its 
products would not be Saudi, even if the Kingdom's share in 
those goods were substantial. 
  The study concluded by saying that establishing a free zone 
in the Kingdom would require conditions, among them the use of a 
system sufficiently flexible in terms of guiding measures for 
establishing imported labor and their families; stimulating the 
financial market in the Kingdom; lifting many curbs, while 
retaining controls or enacting similar ones to reduce chances of 
repeating the stock exchange experiment in Kuwait; and studying 
incentives, to aid the success of the free zone without damage 
to the local market in the form of taxes, duties, administrative 
measures, control of foreign currency, and arbitration. It added 
that while the 'Jabal 'Ali free zone was the first to enter the 
free zone world, Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and 
Iran, are considering or may consider their own free zones. It 
is expected that competition would intensify after the 
establishment of these zones, ending the chances of most or even 
all of them for success. Thus it would be necessary to invite 
relevant Arab countries, particularly the GCC states, to 
coordinate among themselves to avoid trouble.

<F P=106> [Article by Moncef Mahroug: "Elections: How the RCD Chose </F>
Its Candidates"--first paragraph is REALITES introduction] 
  [Text] Out of the RCD's [Constituional Democraic Rally] 144 
candidates, 105 are new faces. There are reasons for this 
profound change. 
  When the slates of candidates of the Constitutional 
Democratic Assembly for the 20 March legislative elections were 
made public on Saturday, 26 February, many hopes evaporated and 
many plans collapsed. Because the makeup of the slates surprised 
more than one person. And there was reason to be surprised and 
even to fall over for all those who--and there are probably many 
of them--within the RCD had hoped to appear on these slates and 
who, why not, already saw themselves as deputies. 
  Of the many names that public rumor had held were on the 
RCD's slates of candidates, there were very few whose hopes were 
realized. This is scarcely surprising, at least as it relates to 
outgoing deputies, an overwhelming majority of whom will not 
have the opportunity to be part of the first multicolor Chamber 
of Deputies that will in all likelihood emerge from the 
elections on 20 March. 
  Of the 141 outgoing members of the Chamber, 102 (more than 
70 
percent) will not run again. In this cohort is a group of 
genuine record holders who have spent, often discontinuously, 
between 15 and 30 years at the Bardo Palace. The eldest among 
them is Mr. Habib Tliba, the only member of the current Chamber 
of Deputies to have been a part of the Constituent Council and 
subsequently to have served six terms interrupted by one 
six-year period (between the fourth and fifth terms). 
  However, most of the deputies who are not running again have 
served only one term (78) or two (12). And close to one-half of 
them (50 are between the ages of 40 and 49 and three are between 
30 and 39) are still young. 
  Given such a profound change, it would be difficult to find 
an electoral district untouched by this huge movement. In fact 
there aren't any. Even the rerun rate again varies from one 
district to another. At the two opposite ends there is Nabeul, 
half of whose deputies are running for a new term, and a group 
of seven electoral districts (Gabes, Sfax (2), Mahdia, Ben 
Arous, Tataouine, Kebili, and Tozeur) whose candidates are new 
faces. 
  Only 39 of the RCD's 144 candidates belong to the outgoing 
Chamber of Deputies. The breakdown by age of this group is 
identical with that of the group of the 102 who are not running 
again. Most of them (26) are under the age of 50 (between 40 and 
49 years old). 
  When the composition of the two groups is analyzed, it 
becomes clear that the first criterion--but not the most 
important one, since the number of affected deputies is not very 
large--on the basis of which the selection was made was that of 
the number of terms: no deputy (out of a total of 12) who had 
served more than two terms was chosen to appear on the RCD's 
slates. 
  Those vying for a slot on the RCD's slates also had very 
few--if any-- chances of being reslated if they already have 
other duties. Indeed, the closest aides of the head of state and 
the RCD chairman were told to avoid wearing too many hats per 
individual "so as to expand the exercise of political 
responsibilities" and give new men a chance to test themselves. 
Besides, that is the main reason for the nonappearance in the 
political arena of most of the RCD's big guns and for the 
overwhelming majority of members of the government. 
  Another presidential concern guided the choice of RCD 
candidates in the legislative elections: the concern to ensure 
balance at the local level, i.e., between delegations. The 
allocation of slots among the latter was, in fact, made on the 
basis of a detailed study, which determined the degree of 
representation of each delegation with respect to the various 
categories of political, administrative, and economic staff. 
Thus priority was given to the underrepresented delegations even 
when their "candidate for the candidacy" has a less solid 
profile than someone else's. 
  So the Chamber of Deputies that will emerge from the 20 
March 
elections will be quite different from the present Chamber and 
in particular from the pre-changeover Chamber. Indeed, out of 
the RCD's 144 candidates--105 of whom are new--there are no more 
than five deputies[.sup]1[/] who occupied the same position 
before 7 November 1987, as against 24 in the outgoing Chamber.

  [Text] Informed sources have told AL-SHARQ that there is a 
dispute between the Yemeni president, Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, the secretary general of the General People's 
Congress, and a member of the Presidential Council, Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, the leading member in the Higher Body 
of the Yemeni Grouping for Reform, concerning participation of 
the military attaches in the U.S. and French Embassies in the 
Joint Military Committee. The Joint Military Committee includes 
a group of Yemeni, Jordanian, and Omani officers, in addition to 
the U.S. and French attaches. It is working on separating the 
northern and southern forces in the areas that have been the 
scene of some military tension. 
  These sources said that Shaykh al-Zandani opposes bringing 
the U.S. and French attaches into this committee, whereas 
President Salih welcomes their participation. 
  It should be mentioned that the committee has already 
visited 
a number of military locations and succeeded in defusing 
tensions and dispersing troop concentrations from some points, 
especially in the Mudiyah area of the province of Abyan, which 
had been the scene of a military confrontation after northern 
forces had come to give their support to citizens of the area 
who opposed the southern forces from the al-Wahdah Brigade that 
had come from the province of Hadramawt. The committee also 
managed to remove the northern forces, that were near the former 
border areas, from the southern side. The troops that were 
headquartered in the al-Rahidah area, south of Ta'izz, were 
withdrawn to the Janad area, east of Ta'izz. Also, the troops 
along the line between Ma'rib and Bayhan were separated. 
  In addition to this, a military delegation from the Arab 
League continued its visit to Yemen in order to investigate the 
military situation that nearly exploded during the last two 
days. Sources said that the [Yemeni] Socialist Party is 
demanding that the military committee be expanded and that Arab 
forces be created. 
  In addition to this, it was announced in Sanaa that that a 
preparatory committee had been formed in order to create a 
higher council for Yemen's tribes, and that this committee met 
the day before yesterday in the residence of Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the "chief of the Hashid tribal leaders." 
It was decided to announce the formation of this council during 
the next two days.

<F P=106> [Interview With Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr </F>
al-'Attas by AL-KHALIJ in Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] Yemeni Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas has noted that the situation in Yemen is difficult, 
that any clash could turn into a catastrophe, and that each 
province or tribe can move on its own. He has called for 
dialogue on all opinions, regardless of how disturbing, until 
the ideal unity formula is developed. Speaking of Salim Salih's 
statements on "federalism," al-'Attas said that before unity, 
the north demanded federalism, whereas representatives of the 
south demanded merger. 
  Even though al-'Attas reasserted that Yemen is well and that 
it can overcome its ordeal if the will and the desire are there. 
However, he has expressed his concern for the absence of frank 
dialogue and over "things hatched in the dark." Al-'Attas has 
also warned that a continued crisis could lead to an end of all 
the coalition forces. 
  Al-'Attas has revealed the details and secrets of the 
kidnaping of the U.S. information attache and of other acts of 
violence to which he personally and other party leaders have 
been subjected. He further revealed the details of proposals and 
timetables that he personally, and other party leaders, have 
submitted to end the crisis, including practical measures to 
prevent revenge and the use of revenge politically, to apprehend 
those responsible for violence, and to evacuate armed forces 
from the cities. The Yemeni prime minister has also noted the 
presence of forces determined to engage in sabotage and of 
organizations opposed to unity. But he reaffirmed that he is 
confident that the union will continue and that Yemen can deal 
with the ordeal. 
  He also touched on details of the financial issues and on 
the 
economic and social problems. All this is contained in a lengthy 
interview which AL-KHALIJ conducted with al-'Attas at his home 
in Sanaa. Following are the details. 
<H5>  Economic and Political Crisis </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] Yemen's economic and social crisis seems to be 
extremely severe. The riyal has been sliding so swiftly that a 
dollar is worth 56.5 riyals now. Development seems to be 
suspended, and even normal growth seems to be nonexistent. Even 
though land development in the capital continues, the 
manifestations of poverty seem to have grown worse for somebody 
who visited Yemen a few years ago. Is this a reflection of the 
ongoing political crisis, or are there other reasons? 
  ['Attas] The economic crisis is not caused by the current 
political crises but is an old crisis. Many wagered in the past 
on the collapse of the united Yemen. But the government has made 
very great efforts in recent years, especially in 1991 and 1992, 
and it gained strong control over the economic conditions. In 
1991, the government was able for the first time to control the 
general deficit of the general state budget, reducing that 
deficit from 15 billion to five billion riyals, a figure that 
aroused a great deal of optimism among us. The 1992 budget was 
drafted on the basis of that success, and an investment program 
was drawn up for the first time. 
  We held a joint meeting with the Presidential Council at the 
beginning of 1992, in the wake of political tensions that 
surfaced at the end of 1991. A number of economic measures 
capable of improving the conditions and of neutralizing the 
negative effects of the political developments were taken. 
  But regrettably, political tensions and security violations 
increased, and those developments swept away numerous 
aspirations. The crisis climaxed in December 1992, thus forcing 
the government to address a strongly worded message to the 
political leaders. We also discussed the crisis at the House of 
Representatives. 
  What happened during those crises could have been overcome 
if 
it had not been for the absence of a united political will at 
the leadership--an absence which led to exploiting the 
conditions and manipulating the economy. 
  Even if professional merchants respect their trade and 
operate in a sound economic manner, intruders corrupt 
everything. The fluctuating prices that we are experiencing are 
the result of the activity of these intruders and corrupters. 
<H5>  Fabricated Operation </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] Do you mean that the drop in the value of the 
national currency is a fabricated thing that does not reflect 
the true economic conditions? 
  ['Attas] Yes, it is fabricated. It is also tantamount to 
exploitation of the crisis for illicit gain. Last December, we 
started organizing a currency exchange rate list compatible with 
our tendency to move toward a free-market economy. But even that 
list has been nullified. However, we continue to try to 
implement it. I met with the Central Bank management a few days 
ago. The unsound approach to exchange rates and to currency 
should be ended by the end of this current month (November). 
Severe penalties will be imposed on any illicit transactions 
violating the official list. 
  Regrettably, there are large numbers of merchants who are 
engaged in the money-changing trade. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] Frankly, can merchants play such a serious game 
without being backed in one way or another? 
  ['Attas] I will emphasize that good merchants, including the 
Federation of Chambers of Commerce and well-known merchants, 
have taken a good position. They are opposed to what is going on 
in the market. But intruders are exacerbating the crisis. There 
are also responsible citizens who, regrettably, engage in the 
money-changing trade in a faulty manner. 
<H5>  Fearful Spending </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] More frankly, I have learned that the people's 
hardship has reached such a phase that people are disavowing the 
coalition, unity, and democracy. 
  ['Attas] The economic condition is the main issue, of 
course. 
All political accomplishments mean nothing if the citizen 
experiences problems in his daily life. This is why, when 
drafting the 1992 budget, we were eager to curtail inflation and 
the economic problems. A main cause of inflation is the general 
state budget. It so happens that I was talking to the finance 
minister a short time ago. Vast sums of money are spent without 
even consulting the prime minister. A short time ago, I was 
reminding the finance minister that he is not entitled to spend 
such immense sums, even if he receives instructions from any 
other authority. 
  State spending is fearful, especially the military 
establishment's spending. I do not believe that all that is 
spent in the name of this establishment is used for its benefit. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] It is normal that the military establishment's 
spending grows under the circumstances of the political crisis 
and when the conflicting forces rely on their own military 
forces. 
  ['Attas] The truth is that this spending is not a 
consequence 
of the crisis. The volume of spending on the military 
establishment has been a subject of dispute since 1991. At the 
outset of 1992, we tried to curtail this spending, but to no 
avail. In July this year, prior to the crisis, I held a meeting 
with the finance minister, defense minister, and the military 
establishment, and the focus was on the problem of food supplies 
and on spending on personnel. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] What are the figures that can be made public in 
the military sphere? 
  ['Attas] Our armed forces are 246,000-strong. But we have 
taken an official decision that they will not exceed 150,000. 
<H5>  Smuggling Problems </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] Why has Yemen's currency not been unified to 
date, despite the announcements on such a step? 
  ['Attas] To begin with, I would like to say that the 
economic 
situation can be brought under control, that the riyal can 
regain its strength, and that the standard of living can be 
enhanced if two things are achieved: first, control over state 
spending and, second, control over state revenues. A total of 50 
percent of the state revenues are not collected, and smuggling 
is growing by bounds and leaps. Whenever we move to seize 
smuggling cases, our movement is thwarted. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] I have heard merchants and sellers say that high 
prices in interior towns are due to the fact that merchants are 
forced to pay large sums of money, which are levied on them 
between the coastal towns and the interior. 
  ['Attas] Those who guard smuggling are the people who 
collect 
these enormous sums. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] Does not a part of these sums end up in the 
state 
budget, in the form of official taxes? 
  ['Attas] No part ends up in the state budget, and this is 
one 
of the most significant problems. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] But we have heard that the people who make the 
collection are people in an official capacity? 
  ['Attas] These people use some facilities; they permit 
smuggling; they gain and the country, the economy, and the 
government lose the revenues to which they are entitled. What is 
more important is that the majority of the imported goods are 
outside the program adopted by the Council of Ministers. This 
importing increases the demand for dollars puts more pressure on 
the national currency. But in spite of this, I emphasize that 
Yemen has the resources to control the economic situation. Oil 
revenues are increasing. If the other resources are brought 
under control, there will be no deficit in the Yemeni budget. 
<H5>  Unified Currency </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] A lot of reports were disseminated prior to the 
latest crisis, indicating that the disbursement of salaries 
would be held up by numerous state institutions. At times, these 
reports led to strikes and demonstrations staged in the face of 
an unconvincing explanation which used the lack of printed 
currency as an excuse. What is the true explanation concerning 
this issue? 
  ['Attas] This confirms the opposite of what some brothers 
allege, namely that the crisis is the result of the current 
circumstances. During the 1992 crisis, these brothers hoarded 
money in their homes and kept it away from banks because of some 
steps taken by the Central Bank to counter speculation in 
riyals. It was especially noticed then that large-scale bank 
credits were acquired not to import, set up plants, or invest in 
agriculture, but to speculate in currency. This is why the 
Central Bank hastened to suspend the credits, thus causing a 
reaction among speculators and a liquidity problem. This was a 
temporary problem, which we tackled promptly. Beyond this 
framework, the problem also materialized due to administrative 
reasons, considering that the paperwork is heavy and saddles the 
administration. We seek to eliminate this paperwork. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] Both currencies of Yemen have collapsed. But 
relatively speaking, the dinar has collapsed by a much greater 
degree. Why? 
  ['Attas] The exchange rate has been set at 26 riyals per 
dinar. But sellers and merchants deal on the basis of an 
exchange rate of one shilling per riyal. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] How? 
  ['Attas] (With a laugh) Just like that. They even try khat 
[to set the exchange rate]. But citizens in the southern and 
eastern governorates have been affected by this drop. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] Which means that the people are more determined 
than the government to unify the currency. 
  ['Attas] This is why we have decided to withdraw the dinar, 
why we have actually decided that the riyal is the state 
currency, and why we have printed enough riyals to meet the need 
throughout the republic. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] We know that there has been a decision to unify 
the currency. But both currencies continue to be in circulation. 
  ['Attas] Yes, the decision to unify the currency was made in 
1991. But the 1992 liquidity crisis forced the Central Bank to 
put the dinar, which it had begun to withdraw, back in 
circulation. The consequences of this problem have persisted in 
spite of the decision to adopt the riyal. Now, we are actually 
thinking of adopting a new currency. 
  Here we would like to remind those who accuse the YSP 
[Yemeni 
Socialist Party] of seeking to secede that this party is the 
party that demands a new currency, which represents the united 
state. How could a party demanding a single currency adopt 
secession? A party that wants secession does not try to abolish 
its own currency. 
<H5>  Conflict and Sedition </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] Thank God that you are the one who has brought 
up 
the subject of secession. Perhaps you are aware of brother Salim 
Salih's message, which has been circulated by fax throughout all 
parts of Yemen. This message calls for a federalist formula, 
which some people, especially in the GPC [General People's 
Congress], have considered a test balloon to probe the 
consequences and possibility of backing away from unity. 
  ['Attas] The fact is that in crises like these, all are 
supposed to have enough wisdom and steadfastness to deal with 
all developments, except backsliding and confrontation. 
  With opinion and intelligence, dialogue can be held on 
everything. If the leadership itself prohibits discussing any 
issue, it denies itself the means and the possibilities of 
developing the right position. 
  A lot is, of course, being said all over Yemen and in Sanaa 
itself. What brother Salim Salih has said is personal and does 
not represent the [YSP] party. Currently, things a whole lot 
more serious than this are being raised in Sanaa. Such things 
can be concluded from the campaign against the YSP. Last month, 
a statement was distributed by the GPC, entitled "YSP 
Provocations on the Path of Secession." Those words were an 
intelligence report, fundamentally, and we familiarized 
ourselves with that report when the Political Bureau acquired a 
copy prior to the Central Committee meeting. The whole statement 
is nothing but lies. The more serious part of that statement is 
the second part, which contains the recommendations. Whoever 
reads this statement can see what the premeditated plans are. 
  The statement says that the YSP sells weapons and military 
equipment and vehicles, and that it seeks secession. Can this be 
true? What kind of contradictions are these? Does one who seeks 
secession sell his strength and get rid of it, or does he insist 
on maintaining it? These are contradictory and irrational words. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] Unless money becomes more important than weapons 
in the conflict. 
  ['Attas] (Laughing) Of course, all weapons are used in 
conflicts. But not insofar as we are concerned. What I meant by 
citing this instance is to point out that there are things that 
fan the fires of conflict and sedition and that do not bring 
people together and unite them. 
  In light of brother Salim Salih's statements, I had an 
appointment yesterday to meet with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
and with brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi. Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
didn't show up. He then called me and said: Have you seen Salim 
Salih's statement? I said: No. He then came and brought the 
statement, which I had not read, with him. So, I said to him: 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim, have you contacted Salim Salih and others and 
told them we "either hold together on equitable terms, or 
separate with kindness" [Koran 2:229]. 
  When I talked to Salim Salih, he responded: 'Abd-al-Karim 
says such things, so why do not you protest against him? 
  Frankly, I personally am not worried by any opinion 
expressed 
openly to be debated. I worry when things are hatched in the 
dark. 
<H5>  Confrontation Is Catastrophic </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] There are those who see that the most 
significant 
reasons of the crisis are the conflicting opinions within each 
of the coalition parties. They also believe that internal 
conflicts within each party, whether the YSP, the GPC, or the 
YGR [Yemeni Grouping for Reform], paralyze dialogue and reflect 
on it negatively and that all these parties include forces that 
support unity and forces that oppose it. What is your opinion? 
  ['Attas] This is a fact. If you examine the pre-unity 
positions, you would find that there were anti-unity forces in 
the parties. I believe that many of those forces have not 
changed their positions. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] But does not this mean that should, God forbid, 
conditions move in the direction of confrontation and secession, 
then not only the two parts that existed in the past will be 
brought back into existence, but a hundred catastrophes will 
arise? 
  ['Attas] This is a foregone conclusion. We are aware of it, 
and we all work to prevent such a development, because nobody 
will be able to control any military confrontation. Numerous 
forces will enter into the conflict. Each province or tribe will 
be able to move on its own and all will be destroyed. 
  This is why we are eager to control matters and to prevent 
any conflict. Let people carry on with the dialogue until they 
develop solutions to all problems. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] What point has the joint Council of 
Ministers-House of Representatives Committee reached in its work? 
  ['Attas] In the latest meeting, the committee's concern was 
to prevent an escalation of the crisis, to contain this crisis, 
and to create the conditions for dialogue. 
  The House of Representatives really planned to take steps to 
deal with the crisis. The house protested a statement I made 
against this tendency when I was in Aden. I reiterate now that 
such a decision is tantamount to a war declaration [as 
published]. It would be a positive step on the house's part to 
back away from this line, to understand its responsibility, and 
to realize the dangers that would emanate from this tendency. I 
intended my aforementioned statement to clarify matters. But it 
"upset" the House of Representatives, and it would have behooved 
the house not to get upset. It has been proven to it now that 
this line is destructive and that it may actually lead to 
secession. 
<H5>  Unity and Federalism </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] Do we understand from your words that the joint 
Cabinet-House committee has stopped its effort to solve the 
crisis? 
  ['Attas] No, it continues to work to contain the crisis. I 
believe that the best way is to continue the dialogue and to put 
everything, regardless of how disturbing, on the table. 
Yesterday (Saturday), I advised the brothers in the coalition 
not to be provoked by Salim Salih's statement and not to respond 
to him inappropriately. Otherwise, they will contribute to the 
escalation. Permit me to say that the media have played a 
fundamental role in this issue and that we have to discuss 
everything now. 
  It is true that when we discussed the unity issue, the plan 
of the brothers here (meaning the former North Yemen) was a plan 
for a federal union. But the south demanded a merger, and the 
brothers here acknowledge this fact. It is true that it seems 
that we did not study the conditions in Yemen carefully and that 
we could have embraced the procedure gradually. But emotion had 
its influence, and there actually was a rush to accomplish unity 
when the accord was signed in November 1989, with the 
determination to accomplish unity the following November. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] Do you mean that problems were carried over to 
the united Yemen and that you agree with those who believe that 
the YSP and the GPC rushed to unity in order to escape from 
their regional problems, thus trying to gain the sympathy of the 
unity-minded Yemeni public, and that, consequently, the 
preparations necessary for unity were not made? 
  ['Attas] Yes. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] But observers of the situation in Yemen believe 
that it is no longer possible to back away from the unity 
formula. 
  ['Attas] This is one of the problems facing us. I have no 
decisive opinion on how to deal with issues. But one is forced 
to swallow a bitter pill at times. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] But every force in the coalition wants the 
others, but not itself, to swallow the bitter pill. 
  ['Attas] Yes, this is the problem. If it persists, they will 
all perish. 
<H5>  Brink of Abyss </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] Even the dialogue is about to come to a halt. 
Dialogue sessions have been postponed repeatedly. Meeting dates 
have been announced repeatedly. But no meetings have been held 
by the committees or between the president and his vice 
president. 
  ['Attas] We do not know who schedules these meetings! The 
meeting between the president and his vice president is 
something else. 
  Let me reveal to you here a dialogue program which we (the 
YSP) presented but which was rejected by the GPC. It is a 
three-part program: The first part deals with the constitutional 
amendments and calls for abolishing them for the time being. The 
second part concerns the Presidential Council election, and the 
third deals with controversial issues. We have made this 
proposal: We cannot discuss all issues now in a tense climate. 
So let us define and list the issues and then commit ourselves 
to discuss them two weeks after the crisis eases. Now let us 
focus on one issue, namely the security issue. Three things 
emanate from this issue: suspicion; revenge, which must be 
outlawed; and the armed forces' presence in cities. We delivered 
this proposal to them [in the GPC] but they rejected it. Now, 
they want to return to the proposal. But frankly, we find that 
its time has passed. 
  So, let us ask: Does he who submits these proposals want to 
solve the problem or not? I asked them this question and 
delivered to them the program in the YSP's name. I, Jarallah, 
and Dr. Yasin debated with them. I personally wrote the minutes 
of the meeting when I noticed that the debate was getting 
complex and that things were being done outside the committee to 
obstruct the committee's work. At times, one wonders about their 
logic and about how they could reject such proposals. What is 
more, they come now to tell us: We agree to the 18 points! Why 
did they not agree to them when they were announced? I cannot 
understand what is going on. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] It is obvious that what has happened to date 
between the coalition forces is a dialogue of the deaf. Despite 
the small degree of relaxation created by the U.S. statements 
and by the U.S. definition of the controls of the conflict, the 
question that persists is: Until when will Yemen be able to 
withstand the brinkmanship policies? Is it logical to wager more 
on outside forces than on internal dialogue? 
  ['Attas] I answered this question with a public address I 
delivered at the conclusion of the conference of the Nasirite 
Popular Unionist Organization. I said no solutions will come 
from abroad. We are the ones who should tackle the problem. It 
is futile to wager on the outside world. This problem can only 
be solved by Yemen's sons, by the responsible among them, and by 
the coalition in particular. There is no justification to waste 
time any longer. The most difficult thing facing us is rejection 
of reality and the refusal to deal with it soundly. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] What is the role you envision for the political 
forces that are outside the coalition? 
  ['Attas] They can play an assisting role. But the 
decisionmaking is in the coalition's hands, particularly hands 
of the YSP and the GPC. They are the two parties that can make 
the decision. They are confronted with a historic 
responsibility. They are the two parties that made the unity, 
and they are the ones that can preserve it. 
<H5>  Honesty and Confidence </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] With the unity declaration, people ignored all 
the negatives that had preceded the declaration, and the two 
parties were crowned as champions of unity. Do not the two 
parties consider this fact now, and do they not realize the 
dimensions of the danger and the defacement that will afflict 
them if any setback is suffered? 
  ['Attas] Certainly. But what we lack now are the honesty and 
the confidence to overcome difficulties. The Gulf War was the 
first tremor to hit Yemen's unity. Many questions remain 
unanswered. After the war, people sensed danger, and they 
united. But then the problem resurfaced. Since the middle of 
1991, we have been confronted with successive crises. We formed 
the first joint YSP-GPC committee to solve this problem in 
November 1991. But we continue to suffer, and this is amazing. 
  Note: at this moment, an employee arrived with a big 
envelope. The prime minister asked Mrs. Amat-al-'Alim 
al-Sawsawah, the Information Ministry undersecretary, to read 
passages from the program, and then said: "She will read so you 
can hear the text from her." But Amat-al-'Alim said, "I have 
memorized it. I do not need to read it." Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas responded, "No, they have not distributed this to 
you." After pointing out that the passage is from an official 
proposal which he, al-'Attas, submitted on 10 October to deal 
with the crisis, she read: 
  "Proceeding on basis of the accord signed by the party 
[YSP] and the grouping [YGR], which states that introducing the 
constitutional amendments is one of the tasks that must be 
accomplished; considering that the time available has not helped 
the parties to the coalition to accomplish this task in the 
period since the Presidential Council's term was extended; and 
in order to provide the proper period of time to complete and 
pass the amendments; to underline the coalition's eagerness to 
reassert the democratic march which was launched on 27 April 
1993; to cement national unity and the trust between the 
coalition parties; and out of concern for this pioneer 
experiment, the allied parties have agreed on the following: 
  "First, the parties to the coalition will carry on with 
the dialogue to develop an agreed formula for the constitutional 
amendments during a maximum period of three months. The formula 
agreed on for the constitutional amendments will be submitted as 
a plan for general discussion. A national committee will be 
formed of the ruling coalition parties, the opposition parties, 
university professors in Sanaa and Aden, ulema, and social 
figures and submit draft amendments to be approved and passed by 
the House of Representatives within a maximum period of two 
years. 
  "Second, the Presidential Council will be elected in 
accordance with the current Constitution, on the basis of the 
coalition, and through agreement among the parties to the 
coalition: the GPC, the YSP, and the YGR. 
  "Third, in view of shortness of the time available to 
debate the issues raised by the YSP, as well as the issues 
raised by the coalition parties, on developing the state and on 
the citizens' problems, and in view of the approval attached to 
this accord and its supplements (1, 2, and 3), the parties to 
the coalition have agreed on the following: 
  "1. Continue the dialogue to unify the coalition's 
vision of the issues that have been raised and that are attached 
to this accord so as to help the government implement this 
accord. 
  "2. The coalition will undertake to complete this task 
within two weeks. 
  "3. The coalition will require its members in the 
government to implement the contents of the cabinet statement. 
  "In view of the importance of some issues and of their 
impact on security and on the stability of the citizens' living 
conditions, the parties to the coalition have agreed on the 
following: 
  "1. The coalition declares its adoption of a general 
truce among the tribes. In accordance with this truce, the 
practice of revenge shall be prohibited. Whoever engages in 
taking revenge shall be considered an outlaw, and the state 
agencies concerned shall take strict legal measures against him. 
A national committee shall be formed to survey and deal with 
cases of revenge occurring prior to the declaration. The 
government shall incur any expenses required by this step. The 
truce shall be declared within two weeks. 
  "2. The coalition shall assign the government to take 
the steps necessary to arrest suspects whose names have been 
mentioned during investigations of the assassinations and 
assassination attempts, highway robberies, and of other security 
violations within a maximum period of six weeks. Whoever harbors 
a suspect shall be considered in violation of the law, and legal 
steps shall be taken against him. 
  "Army forces shall be evacuated from major cities in 
accordance with the unity accords. The Presidential Council 
shall ratify Council of Ministers decree No. (....) on the 
temporary administrative division of the republic. 
  "4. Monthly reports shall be submitted to the coalition 
leadership by the authorities concerned on the implementation of 
the contents of this accord and on adoption of the necessary 
measures." 
<H5>  Credibility Crisis </H5>
  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas went on to add, "This is a copy of 
the letter that was not approved on 10 October. Now all 18 
points are accepted. How come?" 
  [AL-KHALIJ] The GPC feels that the YSP is pushing in the 
direction of escalating the conflict and is calling for 
involving the opposition forces in the dialogue so as to broaden 
its political base. What is your opinion? 
  ['Attas] Numerous documents developed by the GPC and the YSP 
met their end before they were signed. We have had discussions 
with each other, we have met repeatedly since last September, 
and we have had discussions within the coalition. When we 
submitted this proposal to the dialogue committee in the YSP's 
name, it was a realistic and responsible proposal to overcome 
the crisis and then to deal with issues calmly. 
  Now top-level GPC circles say that they will accept whatever 
the YSP accepts. 
  There is an issue that has escaped many, namely the issue of 
confidence. Because of the crisis, confidence exists no longer, 
and herein lies the problem. The president has told me: I state 
explicitly and say that I have accepted all 18 points. I 
responded: It is no use now. We discussed all the details in 
your presence, so why did you not say this? 
  The problem is that I doubt that the statements by the GPC 
circles are sincere. In truth, the more important problem is: 
How do we restore confidence? 
  Yesterday I received a report from the party in Ta'izz 
indicating that the plan to assassinate (Anisi?), a parliament 
member representing the YSP, and the party organization 
secretary goes on. I sent the report today, Sunday, to the 
interior minister and to the security agency chief to be 
investigated. There are forces determined to engage in sabotage. 
Even in the latest operation in which a U.S. information 
official was kidnapped, the kidnapper used a car that carried a 
forged license plate attributed to Aden. 
<H5>  Security Secrets </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] What are the secrets behind the kidnapping? 
  ['Attas] This person is an army colonel named Mubarak Salih 
Mashan al-Zayidi. He had previously carried out an act that 
caused an oil pipeline to rupture and production to be stopped 
for 48 hours. We decided to send a force to arrest al-Zayidi. 
But tribal chiefs intervened to solve the issue. However, here 
he is, persisting in his acts. By the way, he is not the only 
one to engage in such acts. Before him, another man kidnaped 
French tourists in the same province of Ma'rib. We said: Let us 
punish this man. They responded: We will settle the issue 
tribally. The man demanded a salary and some other things. An 
offense against Yemen is something easy to these people. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] It seems that for the YSP, the security problem 
is the most urgent problem. 
  ['Attas] Not just for the YSP, but for all of Yemen. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] The interior minister has held the Jihad 
Organization responsible and has asserted that there are 15 
Jihad members in jail and that efforts are being made to arrest 
the others, totaling nearly 60 in number. 
  ['Attas] Jihad is one of the forces involved. These forces 
were determined some time ago, and we embarked on a conflict 
over arresting them and bringing them to trial. Even the 
interrogation reports have been altered. This is amazing. The 
security agencies and this alien organizations cross paths, and 
perhaps the organization is used. 
  What offends the YSP even more is that after each incident 
of 
the sort, some GPC leaders say that it is the result of conflict 
within the YSP. This has offended the YSP greatly. If the GPC 
has such information, then it should seize those who are 
responsible for the incidents, even if they are from the YSP. 
  When I received the first threat about a mine planted near 
my 
home, I was meeting with the deputy prime ministers. Suddenly, 
the mine exploded and soldiers rushed to the explosion site. 
There they were able to apprehend two people. The traces of TNT 
were still showing strongly on the hand of one of the two men, 
because he had planted the explosive and connected it to a fuse, 
hence the traces on his hand. We apprehended the man and the 
report, photographs, and all interrogation requirements were 
prepared. The next day, security forces took the evidence and 
altered the report at their laboratory. They said that the 
traces the man had on his hand were those of qat, as if qat 
contains TNT. They also said that the mine was not an antitank 
mine but an anti-personnel mine, even though we know that the 
mine was an antitank mine, and this is supported by photographs 
and data. 
  The interior minister presented this modified report to the 
Council of Ministers. We also discovered that the young officer 
who had prepared the original report had been dismissed from his 
work. 
  At the Council of Ministers, I said, "O interior minister, 
there is a crossing of paths in your agencies." They then said 
that the suspect, a 28-year-old man, is insane. 
  This is how an incident aimed against the prime minister has 
been handled, and the prime minister cannot learn the truth! 
  This incident occurred in 1992. Afterward, assassinations 
were perpetrated with the purpose of pressuring people. All this 
happened after the security plan was drafted. This is why we 
want to establish security first, and then the development and 
reform program will follow. 
  The threats continued by phone. One day, I was sitting here 
and I had the interior minister, his deputy, and some Interior 
Ministry brothers with me. The telephone rang and the caller 
said that Dr. al-Maqalih wanted to talk to me. So I took the 
receiver to speak to al-Maqalih, but what I heard was a 
different voice. So, I said to the caller, "You aren't 
al-Muqalih." He said that he was and that his voice was 
different because of qat. I gestured to the interior minister to 
do something, if he could. Suddenly, the man started threatening 
me on the phone. This happened in May, and they exploded the 
mine afterward. What is surprising is that the voice was 
familiar to me and that it rings in my ears. But I could not 
identify it. 
<H5>  Premeditated Violence </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] An observer notices that acts of violence were 
perpetrated prior to the elections, were stopped during the 
elections, and resurfaced prior to the latest crisis. How do you 
understand this condition? Are the acts premeditated? Who is 
behind them? 
  ['Attas] They are premeditated. It is as if they proceed "on 
command." As to who the planners are, only God knows. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] The interior minister has told us that he will 
announce all the facts very soon. 
  ['Attas] God willing. I had an appointment with them 
regarding this issue for today, Sunday. But they have not 
finished. There is a lot of information on violence, especially 
by the Jihad Organization and by some other elements. Agreement 
was reached on this issue, and we decided to arrest a group of 
people, some of them residing in the southern governorates and 
some here. Orders were issued to police stations. The brothers 
in the southern governorates arrested the individuals wanted 
immediately and brought them here. But here, the wanted, who 
include officers, enter and leave Sanaa, and nobody dares arrest 
them. 
  When I said that the wanted included officers, they asked: 
Who? One of them is Najib al-Salahi, an officer in the first 
armored division. When we raised his name, they said: We can 
bring this one at any time. When I sent a message to the 
interior minister to arrest them, no answer was given. A lot can 
be said about this issue. The important thing is that security 
concerns all people and that nobody can live without security. 
  In wake of the accord, acts of violence were premeditated, 
and they "erupted and stopped" with some sort of intelligence. 
While main elements of the YSP have been targeted directly, some 
explosions have been staged near the homes of some GPC leaders. 
Explosions have been staged near the homes of 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-'Arshi and of al-Lawzi. But one feels that they are for 
coverup so people will not say that the blows are aimed against 
the YSP alone. There is a difference between shooting to kill 
and shooting for some other purpose. 
  On 5 September, I went to discuss the security issue and to 
debate Yemen's conditions with brother 'Ali al-Bid. I arrived in 
Aden and during my meeting with brother 'Ali, the telephone rang 
and I was told that it was the interior minister. He told me not 
to worry about the bomb that had exploded near my home and said 
that he was investigating the issue. Okay, who exploded this 
bomb, and why? It is as if whoever did it wanted to say to me: 
Why are you going to Aden? Leave the issue alone. Why do you 
tackle it? 
<H5>  Foreign Forces, But.... </H5>
  [AL-KHALIJ] What are your reports and your information on 
this issue? 
  ['Attas] There are parties hostile to the Yemeni people's 
true aspirations. Jihad is just a part of the process. Even 
Jihad is used by others. Our party has expressed its opinion, 
and I have personally sent a message to the Presidential Council 
on the issue. We want to deal with the problem. We know that 
there are foreign forces working against unity. But the 
executors are Yemeni citizens. We want to tell Yemeni citizens: 
Break the ties with the foreign forces. We talk to these people 
clearly, but we do nothing else to them. What more can we do? 
  I offered several proposals to end this issue: We can arrest 
those responsible for what has been done, but we do not harm 
them. We just tell them: Here are the facts, and here is where 
you stop. Or else we can relieve the Interior Ministry leaders, 
because they are unable to end this phenomenon. Or the Council 
of Ministers can resign and a new government can be formed. 
  They responded: We will end the issue. We reviewed all the 
names, and all they did was to arrest the famous poor young man 
(al-Fadli) in Shabwah. He revealed all the names, but they have 
done nothing important to end the crisis. 
  [AL-KHALIJ] In an interview with AL-KHALIJ two months ago, 
brother Anis Yahya raised the issue of the escape of prisoners 
from jail. When I raised this issue here in Sanaa, people 
pointed out to me that the jail is under the control of officers 
and officials from the YSP. What do you say? 
  ['Attas] I addressed a committee of the House of 
Representatives and said that the mistake that the brothers here 
made and whose negative consequences we are reaping now is that 
the brothers here believed that everything in the south, 
including people, land, and institutions, belonged to the YSP, 
even though this is not true. (Here, Mrs. Amat-al-'Alim 
interposed to say, "Thank God.") 
  (Al-'Attas went on to add:) We have been saying this for a 
long time. But this mistake and others have caused the people in 
the south to react, making them all insist that the YSP is their 
representative in the unity. In the latest election, all people 
in the south voted for the YSP, which was even the reason behind 
the two GPC candidates who won in the south. (Again, Mrs. 
al-'Alim interposed to say, "Regrettably, this is not good for 
the country." The prime minister said Amen to her words). 
  (Al-'Attas further added:) Even we in the YSP did not expect 
more than 50 percent of the southern vote. But because of this 
position, people reacted, and they all considered the YSP their 
true representative. We did not want this thing to happen. 
Regrettably, there are many who have begun pondering unity in 
its current form. Numerous mass organizations have begun to rise 
and to move in this direction. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ilyas Masuh: "'Ali Nasir Says to AL-QABAS: `Yes, </F>
They Offered To Let Me Form the Yemeni Government, But I 
Declined'"] 
  [Text] The former Yemeni president, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, 
told AL-QABAS that Yemeni officials who met two weeks ago in 
Amman offered to let him form a Yemeni government which would 
take over the job of implementing the Document of Pledge and 
Accord. However, he declined the offer, saying: "I felt that 
taking on the job under these circumstances would result in an 
escalation of the explosive situation." 
  'Ali Nasir added: "I stressed the importance of having 
existing bodies assume the job of implementing the document, 
rather than being content to merely sign it." He indicated that 
it would have been possible for him to take on the job if the 
offer had been the result of a meeting of the Presidential 
Councils, the ministers, and Parliament. However, he said that 
"these councils did not take this initiative, and this prompted 
me to focus on the importance of these parties' taking the 
initiative to implement the document." 
  'Ali Nasir then said: "I participated in the signing 
ceremony, but I did not sign the document, and I stressed, both 
before and after Amman, the importance of good intentions and an 
initiative in the direction of implementation being taken by the 
bodies concerned in the Presidential Councils, by the ministers, 
and by the Parliament, and that all parties, one after the 
other, commit themselves to implementation, including the 
security organizations. I proposed that the meetings be held in 
Aden or Sanaa, as an indication of the fact that all parties 
desire to create and implement the solutions and be committed to 
them. The document in itself is very important, it has the 
objective of having the country emerge from its crisis, it 
contains a national program, and it is the result of a 
collective national effort made by all parties and leaders in 
the Yemeni arena. Also, it has the support of the Arabs and 
international support. However, the implementation, 
unfortunately, has coincided with military events in some areas, 
whereas what is needed is to seek a solution by means of a 
dialogue, not by means of shots fired by artillery, tanks, and 
airplanes." 
  The former Yemeni president called for a search to be made 
for other alternatives in order that national Yemeni unity be 
preserved and in order to avoid bloodshed. He called upon the 
leaders to seek a solution via the Document of Pledge and 
Accord, which expresses the aspirations of the Yemeni people who 
have suffered from so many problems and hardships, and said that 
this situation is one which necessitates the creation of rapid 
solutions.

<F P=106> [Article by Nasir Yahya: "Struggle in Yemen and Unknown </F>
Future"] 
  [Text] Sanaa--Yemen's political crisis continues to run in 
place, even though the intensity of the propaganda campaigns has 
diminished greatly. This intensity is what contributed to 
fanning the fires of disagreement and to inciting secessionist 
and provincial emotions. 
  While the crisis is turning into a reality entrenching the 
existence of two governments, each imposing its presence and 
control over a part of the country, Yemeni political forces 
continue their dialogue on a number of issues that are assumed 
to be the cause of the crisis! However, all are aware that this 
dialogue will not lead to a strong solution as long as 'Ali 
Salih, the president, and 'Ali Salim, his vice president, have 
not met face to face to discuss the issues causing the conflict. 
  Ordinary Yemenis have been awaiting the outcome of the 
anticipated meeting between the Yemeni president and his vice 
president in al-Jund on 9 January in response to an invitation 
from a number of ulema. This area was chosen as a good omen 
because it witnessed the meeting between Yemeni people and 
Mu'adh Bin-Jabal, one of the prophet's veneered companions, and 
the announcement of the Yemenis' adoption of Islam. 
  But the fact is that the country's political crisis is 
becoming more complex and that it exceeds all popular 
expectations. It is extremely difficult to expect a bilateral 
meeting, unless sudden developments crop up. 
  Within this context, limited reports have begun to be leaked 
to the press about a confidential dialogue between the GPC 
[General People's Committee] and the YSP [Yemeni Socialist 
Party] to develop an agreement to settle their disagreements in 
a way that allows each party to maintain an equal share of power 
and enables it to use a veto against anything it rejects or 
anything it feels is damaging to its immediate or future 
interest. 
  Some informed sources add that the accord that is being 
concocted secretly will restore "bilateral" power and will 
exclude the Islamic tendency from power, even though this 
tendency ranked second in the elections! But the socialists 
[YSP] say that the Islamists gained a share of the power at 
their expense. Therefore, the accord will force the GPC to give 
the Islamists a part of its share of the power. In return, the 
YSP will give a similar part of its share to its allies. This 
will make the government look like a national coalition that 
combines all of the country's political tendencies, whereas it 
will, in fact, be a new bilateral sharing of power! Thus, Yemen 
will be unable to overcome its true problems, and it will be led 
anew into a dark tunnel of administrative negativism and the of 
organized plundering of money. 
<H5>  Reality of Separation </H5>
  Unless a new confidential accord exists, it can be said very 
clearly that some sort of a regime that combines the features of 
confederalism and federalism will be entrenched by reaffirming 
the control of the two strong parties over each (former) part of 
Yemen. The actual daily administrative, fiscal, and security 
actions confirm this reality. The government in Sanaa can no 
longer impose any decision on the governorates in which the YSP 
has firm control and where the socialists carry out all their 
actions as if they were an actually independent state. 
  Perhaps what confirms this point is the way the security 
authorities deal with arrivals from the northern governorates. 
Members of the House of Representatives itself are promptly 
prevented from entering the southern governorates if the 
security authorities see a need to prevent them. This happened 
when delegations went to take part in the funeral of Brigadier 
General Husayn 'Uthman 'Ashshal, a YGR [Yemeni Grouping for 
Reform] leader and the first army commander in Aden after the 
British evacuation! 
  Within the same context, Yemen's television Channel 2 (Aden) 
announces repeatedly that any citizen wearing a janabiyah, a 
small dagger that Yemenis wear around their waist as an ornament 
and as a symbol of pride in the Yemeni heritage, will be 
prevented from entering the city of Aden. Perhaps the serious 
nature of this announcement becomes obvious when we realize that 
Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, a Presidential Council member, 
and Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of 
Representatives speaker, cannot enter Aden unless each of them 
removes his janabiyah. 
  Last month, YSP papers published the text of a message 
addressed from the leadership of the party branch in Sanaa, the 
capital, to the party leadership in Aden, urging it to a 
establish a model local government and a society of law, order, 
and progress in the southern and eastern governorates and then 
to spread this model to the rest of Yemen. 
  This message aroused opposition even within the parties 
supporting the YSP, because it means, very simply, an undeclared 
secession in the interest of a single party that controls 
everything! 
<H5>  Failure of Democratic Experiment </H5>
  The most significant indications of the latest crisis is 
that 
it has declared the failure of the experiment involving 
political pluralism and peaceful rotation of power. Consequences 
of the disagreements have led to a reliance on the special armed 
forces of each of the YSP and the GPC. The YSP has refused to 
confine the disagreement to the halls of the House of 
Representatives, where the presumed constitutional legitimacy 
exists, because it knows that it represents a minority that 
possesses nothing. 
  It can be said that the YSP's plan on this affair has 
succeeded because the other parties--the GPC and the YGR--are 
eager not to use the House of Representatives card, considering 
that the rejection of any decisive House resolution could be 
tantamount to a unilateral declaration of secession by a party 
that has gathered all its leaders in Aden and has withdrawn most 
of its deputies from the House of Representatives. 
  Even though the GPC and YGR position toward the House of 
Representatives has affected the House's role negatively and has 
depicted the House as being unable to perform its constitutional 
role, this position has greatly curtailed the wish to secede and 
has embarrassed the YSP, compelling it to stay, even if only 
theoretically, within the framework of the officially 
acknowledged state. 
  But the final outcome will be the burial of the democratic 
experiment and the use of armed force to bolster partisan gains. 
This means that the Constitution is no longer the umpire that 
settles political disputes. 
<H5>  Economic Crisis </H5>
  Parallel to the political crisis, Yemen is experiencing a 
ferocious economic crisis. Since the vice president retired to 
Aden, prices have risen sharply. On the other hand, the value of 
the local currency has dropped by 60 percent vis-a-vis the 
dollar. Economic circles are overwhelmed by varied feelings of 
concern and by fear that living conditions will worsen and that 
the inflation wave will rise, thus posing a threat of the 
recurrence of the riots that Yemen witnessed in December 1992.

<F P=106> [Article by Sa'id al-Qaysi: "Yemen: Secrets of a `Northern' </F>
Attempt to Overthrow 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and the Secret Link 
Between the Army Command in Sanaa and the Fundamentalists"] 
  [Text] The situation in Yemen is still moving in the 
direction of escalation and an explosion. The Document of Pledge 
[and Accord], drawn up by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, is nothing more than a new maneuver which, in the best 
of cases, would be hard to implement. Putting signatures to it 
does not mean the end of the crisis. Instead, it means the 
beginning of [new] crises. 
  In this field report from Sanaa and Aden, AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI 
reveals the secrets about what is going on behind the scenes and 
on the spot. Preparations for secession are taking place, in 
spite of the talk about unity. Each side is gathering its forces 
and rallying its clans and tribes, while awaiting zero hour. A 
few days ago war nearly broke out between the North and South, 
and was only averted because of U.S. intervention. But the 
situation is still like live, burning coals under ashes. The 
unity of today exists only because it is required by parties 
outside Yemen and because the parties in Yemen are afraid that, 
if Yemen splits up this time, it will split up into more than 
just its northern and southern parts. 
  Although there is a general feeling among Yemeni political 
circles that the crisis that exploded last August has calmed 
down somewhat, the political parties in power are refraining 
from asserting that the crisis is on its way toward a solution. 
Anything can happen in this country which is politically and 
socially complex and whose economy is crumbling. In spite of the 
fact that all parties in the conflict are asserting their 
support for "democratic unity" as a firm basis for the building 
of a "modern nation state," as indicated by the Document of 
Pledge and Accord which was initialed on 18 January, the real 
facts are otherwise. Any cautious observer who follows the 
situation in Yemen arrives at the conviction that the issue in 
Yemen is one of power and that the unification was brought about 
in order to solve each party's problems, in accordance with 
their conflicting convictions. 
  Each side is deceiving itself. At least this is true when 
one reads the statements that they make. The Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP], the southern member of the alliance, on the one 
hand, asserts--as expressed by Fadl Muhsin ['Abdallah], minister 
of fish resources and member of the Politburo--that the YSP 
believed, before unification between the North and South took 
place on 22 May 1990, that the situation in the North was one of 
fragmentation, that authority there was weak, and that there was 
a lot of popular resentment against rule by Lieutenant General 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The YSP leader added: "We were wrong in 
our analysis, gave ourselves a pretext for ignoring our own 
problems, and considered unification to be a way out of our 
crisis in the context of a new international situation with 
which we were unable to cope in the South." 
  As for the main northern party, the General People's 
Congress 
[GPC]--a mixture of soldiers, tribesmen, notables, clergymen, 
Islamists, and fundamentalists--people in it considered that the 
situation in the South was fragile, that the YSP's power was 
weak, that the people there were looking forward to getting rid 
of one-party rule, and that it would then be easy to digest and 
absorb the South and put their hands on the oil wealth, which 
was just beginning to be exploited. 
  Thus the unification was established on the basis of 
mistakes 
in analysis, conflicting intentions, and systems that conflicted 
with each other in every way. Even the secretary general of the 
YSP, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who is also the vice president, has 
become so pessimistic that he has said: "No unity has been 
established. Only the publishing of news items has been unified. 
There are two powers--a northern and a southern one--and there 
are also two armies and two capital cities. The unified 
parliament has no power." 
<H5>  More Than Two Parts </H5>
  The truth is that the unification was erected not only on a 
foundation of unrealistic intentions, but there was also a lack 
of trust. Crises came, one after the other, and the YSP 
secretary general very often refused to leave Aden. The last 
time he refused to leave Aden was last August, and this is what 
caused the current crisis to explode and induced all the 
southern leaders to go back to Aden. This collective refusal to 
leave Aden has imposed a de facto situation of secession, in 
spite of the fact that nobody has the power to declare 
secession. The president of Yemen cannot do this because "the 
old division is something that is not going to happen again," 
according to an Arab diplomat close to Lt. Gen. Salih. He fears 
the danger of seeing Yemen split up into more parts than just 
the North and the South. And the South has no intention of 
declaring secession because it, at the present time, prefers to 
regain its power in the South and fix the situation there, and 
also believes that it will be possible to get more than this out 
of the situation. 
  This diplomat explains the YSP's strategy to AL-WATAN 
AL-'ARABI as being one that is based on the idea that the 
organizations set up by the unified state have been a failure 
and that it is necessity to regain control of matters in the 
South. It is also based on pushing the crisis to the point of 
total breakdown and the brink of war in order to mobilize the 
northern forces that oppose Salih's rule and produce slogans 
that express the desires of everyone, especially the people of 
the central areas of Ta'izz and Ibb. In those areas the 
predominant feeling is that power is in the hands of the people 
from the northern part of northern Yemen and that they 
themselves are the ones benefiting the least--in addition to 
their feeling that authority in the North is associated with 
those who follow the Zaydi doctrine of Islam and the fact that 
they consider themselves to be closer to the South, which 
follows the Shafi'i doctrine of Islam. 
  The YSP has been able to manage the crisis with skill and 
craftiness so far. The withdrawal of the southern officials to 
the South resulted in the government offices in the North being 
emptied, and this caused the organizations to be shut down and 
the administrative situation to become worse. Public opinion 
then became fully aware of the aspects of corruption and lack of 
security and control by the internal security forces over all 
the nation's institutions. At the same time, the YSP has managed 
to recover its ability to control the South. In fact, the YSP 
has rallied to its banner many people in the southern opposition 
who felt that unification infringed upon their rights and 
impoverished the South. Moreover, the YSP has been able to 
attract members of the northern opposition and to induce the 
Bakil tribes to adopt a position that supports the thesis and 
demands of the YSP. The northern Bakil tribes are the most 
numerous and they dominate the largest geographic area, and they 
are known for the fact that they have been excluded from power 
by the Hashid tribes. The Hashid tribes are headed by Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the parliament and 
head of the Yemeni Grouping for Reform Party, one of the three 
parties allied with the government, and these tribes are the 
ones that Lt. Gen. Salih belongs to. 
<H5>  Fundamentalist Penetration </H5>
  On the other side of the coin, it appears that the GPC has 
lost a lot of its freedom of action because the crisis has 
revealed the nature and composition of the power structure in 
the North. This power structure is based on the president's 
family, that is, the al-Ahmar family which dominates the 
leadership of the army, and his tribe, the Sanhan, which is one 
of the Hashid tribes whose members make up the Republican Guard 
and Central Security, which number some 80,000 soldiers. 
  The crisis has also uncovered the truth concerning the 
security forces coup which resulted in the deaths of 150 members 
of the YSP. It appeared that there is a relationship between the 
army commanders and the fundamentalist groups led by 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the Presidential Council and 
the strong man in the Reform Party. Secrets have begun to come 
to light concerning the assassination plans and those 
masterminding them, and they are mostly Yemeni and [other] Arab 
fundamentalist soldiers who were trained in Afghanistan and then 
returned to Yemen, through the aid of al-Zandani and by means of 
financing by 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, where camps were set 
up for them in the Sa'dah area, in the northern part of North 
Yemen, and in Ma'rib. A number of them were arrested in Abyan in 
the South, and they confessed what organizations they belonged 
to. They were then smuggled up to the North after they had spent 
a month in the jails of Aden. Official sources assert that these 
fundamentalists include Egyptian soldiers who are on Cairo's 
wanted list. President Husni Mubarak has presented a list of 
their names, as well as maps showing the location of their 
training areas, to 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, the minister of 
planning [and development], who tried to deny the information, 
but without success. 
  In addition to this, the truth concerning the economic 
crisis 
has started to come out. The prime minister, Engineer Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, in a letter sent to President Salih, 
revealed what he claimed to be the counterfeiting of about 20 
billion riyals [YR], an act that was undertaken by a person 
close to the president, by the name of al-'Aqlani Rashidi. The 
prime minister says that the president and one of his assistants 
withdrew at least YR3 billion from the Central Bank during the 
month of November, and the reasons for this were not known, nor 
was it known how the money was spent. In this regard, it is said 
that the money was distributed to the tribes in a campaign to 
mobilize [forces] against the South. 
  The same sources say that the president and the forces under 
his control, in early December, attempted to carry out a plan 
aiming to encircle the city of Abyan, in the South, and surround 
the southern brigade which is guarding the city. The 'Amaliqah 
Brigade, from the North, moved toward the city, but the southern 
army knew about this move and managed to encircle the 'Amaliqah 
Brigade. News from the South says that the United States knew 
about the movements of the northern army and informed the 
southern leaders concerning it, and also demanded that President 
Salih cease all actions which would result in a military clash. 
<H5>  Attempt to Overthrow 'Ali Salih </H5>
  President Salih appears to be weak, he has lost the 
initiative since last December, and he has even begun to make 
statements in support of a dialogue. But in mid-January he tried 
to wreck the dialogue by means of using pressure from the Reform 
Party and the fundamentalists through members of his family. 
Some people have even talked of the existence of a plan to 
remove him and appoint [in his place] Chief of Staff 
'Abd-al-Malik Sayyani, in case he accepts the results of the 
dialogue. President Salih actually did try to avoid accepting 
the Document of Pledge and Accord in a speech he made in the 
city of Ta'izz, in the presence of clergymen, and in which he 
attacked the southern leaders. Also, a committee of clergymen 
was formed for the purpose of blocking the efforts of the 
Dialogue Committee which had arrived at the accord and was 
waiting to have it initialed. 
  It turned out that President Salih also was being subjected 
to foreign pressures, especially on the part of the United 
States, which--in the opinion of a European diplomat who 
followed the crisis from his headquarters in Sanaa--had declared 
that it was against any military conflict and that it favored 
peaceful solutions, and that if a separation of North and South 
were inevitable, it preferred that this be done peacefully and 
without any bloodshed. 
  The Yemeni president had no choice but to accept the 
document, because he knew that a split up between the North and 
South would not necessarily mean going back to the previous 
borders that separated the North from the South. He felt that 
accepting the document did not necessarily mean putting it into 
practice and that there was room for maneuvering. 
  The fact is that there is no one who can bet on seeing the 
document implemented, since it represents a radical overthrow of 
President Salih's authority, according to Muhammad Sa'id 
'Abdallah, known as "Muhsin," who is the minister of housing, a 
member of the Politburo, and one of the YSP's most important 
leaders. The document targets the power structure and is 
designed to reorganize the political system on new bases which, 
in his opinion, confict with the northern system that is based 
on the power of the tribes and the army. One Socialist, however, 
is optimistic and believes that it will be possible to implement 
the document. He even thinks that, if it is only 40 percent 
implemented, this will constitute a victory, especially if the 
clauses concerning security are implemented, if the army is 
removed from the cities, and if some of the local rule clauses 
are implemented. 
<H5>  The Document As a Maneuver </H5>
  There is no doubt that the document is a complicated one and 
is tantamount to an initial agreement similar to the agreement 
between Israel and the PLO in the sense that every clause 
requires a separate agreement. It requires about 40 draft laws 
in order to be implemented, and also necessitates a modification 
of the Constitution. A glance at the document tells us that it 
greatly limits the authority of the president, whereas the 
authority of the prime minister is expanded to include defense 
and finances. At the same time, the administrative, 
security-related, and financial powers of local rule 
[authorities] are expanded. This is against the interests of 
many of the military commanders in Sanaa who constitute the new 
class of nouveaux riches. 
  For this reason, in Sanaa and Aden there is the impression 
that the maneuver will continue. It actually started with the 
negotiations concerning signing the document. President Salih 
made it a condition that the vice president and prime minister 
return to Sanaa, whereas the YSP demands that the document be 
signed and implemented--at least the first part of it which 
concerns security-related matters, that is, removal of the army 
from the cities and organization of the president's and vice 
president's security forces. The YSP has set the condition that 
the document be signed in Amman in the presence of Arab and 
Western leaders in order to guarantee that it be implemented, 
and that the vice president and prime minister return to Aden 
on the basis of the consideration that Aden be the nation's 
capital for six months, that is, until next May. By then the 
clause dealing with security matters in Sanaa will have been 
implemented. 
  Actually everything is moving in the direction of having the 
situation remain as it is today. There are many indications of 
this trend. One of them is the reorganization of authority in 
the South on the political and economic levels. The YSP says 
that, in case the document does not start to be implemented in 
the North, it will be implemented in the South. The YSP has also 
begun to make preparations for a general conference which will 
include all of the parties and key figures and establish a 
"Document Front." [as published] This is a plan that stipulates 
the reorganization of the forces in both the North and the 
South, which rallied under the banner of the YSP, especially 
those from the areas of Ta'izz and Ibb, where the population 
totals 3 million persons. Work is also underway to enlist the 
support of the Bakil tribes and the natives of Ma'rib, the 
oil-rich area in the North. 
  Concerning economic matters, orders have been given to the 
oil companies operating in the South to begin paying interest 
payments and to transfer them directly to the National Bank 
(formerly the Central Bank) in the South. This is a clearly 
separatist step. Right now negotiations with new companies are 
going on without the North being notified. This is also an 
obvious attempt to impose the status quo that resulted when the 
southerners came to the South and refused to go back North, and 
this is secession, even it it is not labeled as such. 
  Thus it is clear that signing the document does not 
necessarily mean the end of the crisis. Instead, it could mean 
the beginning of new crises. Lack of trust cannot be eliminated 
by means of a signature or a kiss. The gulf is a wide one, and 
each side is sharpening its swords to be ready for an 
opportunity to pounce on its enemies. The current truce is one 
that is being imposed from outside, and it is also the result of 
internal apprehension, because each side knows full well that 
the war will involve all of Yemen and that, if it splits up, it 
will split up into more than just the North and the South. 
<H5>  Counterfeit Dollars and Riyals, a Crisis That Could Use Up </H5>
the Oil Revenues 
  Of course the political crisis has been reflected in the 
economic situation, and this has been expressed by a rise in the 
dollar's exchange rate on the parallel market, where it is equal 
to YR65. But, for numerous and complex reasons, one cannot link 
the decline in the Yemeni currency exclusively to the political 
crisis. Yemen is living without a budget because Prime Minister 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas was not able to convince President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of the necessity of restricting 
presidential expenditures, giving the cabinet authority to 
control and administer expenditures, and not withdrawing funds 
from the Central Bank without obtaining a ministerial decision 
in accordance with the necessities of the budget and the goals 
set by it. 
  Thus the prime minister continued his work in accordance 
with 
the 1991 budget without having the authority to administer 
disbursement operations and without being able to control the 
the money supply and liquidity. The result of this situation was 
that the budget deficit rose to YR25 billion last year, whereas 
the overall value of the budget was YR33 billion. This was 
reflected in the rates of inflation, which worsened to the point 
of being as high as 200 percent per year, which were also 
affected by the increase in volume of monetary liquidity in the 
markets due to the influx of counterfeit currencies of 
denominations of $100 and YR100. 
  Furthermore, the increase in monetary liquidity led to an 
increase in purchasing power and an increase in the value of 
imports, so that the balance of trade deficit totaled YR6 
billion last year and the total public foreign debt went up to 
more than $8 billion. 
  Yemen's currency is not expected to regain its health, 
because the black market finances about 80 percent of the 
imports and because Yemen needs 100 percent of its wheat imports 
and 90 percent of its basic industrial products [are imported]. 
Also, it is not possible to increase the value of the riyal 
without lowering official expenditures and limiting the 
authority of the Presidential Council and the Council of 
Ministers. Any decrease in expenditures will necessarily mean 
following a belt-tightening policy, and will force the 
government to float the riyal in order to have its price be 
determined by the forces of supply and demand in the parallel 
market. In the end, this means raising the prices of imports, 
which will require decreasing the deficit in the balance of 
foreign payments. This will have to be done either by means of 
increasing oil production--which cannot be easily expected 
within a short period of time--or diverting a large portion of 
the oil revenues to cover imports and thus diverting them from 
investment in production or other development projects. 
  There is no doubt that the economic crisis will continue, 
and 
it is expected that Yemen will use up a large portion of its oil 
production during the next two years in order to pay off the 
large deficit in the balance of foreign payments and in order to 
pay off debts and services associated with it, because it is 
also difficult to combat the smuggling operations which are 
sucking up the monetary liquidity which is calculated in terms 
of hard currencies.

  [Text] A broad dispute arose in Yemeni government circles 
after a revelation from Aden concerning some details of the 
state's public budget for 1993. These details included the fact 
that the budget deficit amounted to more than 50 percent of the 
total. At the beginning of this year, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT obtained 
some information indicating that the budget deficit totaled 40 
billion Yemeni riyals [YR]. This is something that recently came 
to light when the new agencies said that the total budget was 
about YR74 billion and that the public revenues amounted to YR32 
billion, whereas the deficit amounted to about YR42 billion. 
Yemeni economic, business, and financial sources had warned of 
the dangers of this deficit if the economic situation in the 
country continued as is as a result of matters piling up during 
the nation's transitional period to national unity and unlimited 
public expenditures. They warned of the consequences of the 
monetary policy that is being followed and the government's 
continued printing of more paper currency without sufficient 
backing--something that has weakened the value of the domestic 
currency vis-a-vis hard currencies and increased the rate of 
inflation. 
  The sources, in subsequent statements, went on to say that 
the political crisis that has afflicted the nation since August 
[of 1993] has caused complication of the economic situation and 
the addition of new factors to the problem facing the nation's 
public budget. 
  It was not known precisely how the Yemeni Government has 
managed to deal with the deficit in the nation's public budget, 
which has been steadily increasing during the last year. But 
economic sources have indicated that one approach it has used 
has been that of printing more Yemeni currency bills and 
flooding the market with them. This has recently led to the 
collapse of the Yemeni currency vis-a-vis hard currencies, 
especially the U.S. dollar, the price of which in the parallel 
market has increased to more than five times its official price 
declared by the Yemeni Central Bank. It has not yet been 
possible to determine accurately how these huge amounts of 
money, included in the public budget deficit, have been spent. 
But the sources have indicated that the total spent on wages, 
salaries, compensations, and other such payments amounts to far 
more than 50 percent of the total budget, which is YR74 billion, 
according to the latest information. What this means is that 
even the total in revenues is unable to cover the salaries and 
wages earned by more than one-half million Yemenis, that is, the 
total number of persons employed in the nation's public sector, 
administrative apparatus, and armed forces units. 
  The sources have said that the events of 1993--particularly 
the public elections that took place in April and subsequent 
political developments in the country, the last of which was the 
public census project they decided to postpone--also resulted in 
a new burden for the public budget. The government recklessly 
spent billions in order to deal with the demands of this 
experiment, and the two parties in power spent unlimited amounts 
of money in order to gain more supporters and mobilize them to 
confront the other side. 
  Concerning the development projects and services programs, 
the sources have said that they were allotted only a small part 
of the public budget. No improvement worth mentioning has been 
noticed in services and infrastructure projects. Also, people 
have not noticed any new additions. The situation has remained 
as it was in previous years, or else has gotten even worse, 
especially with regard to roads, electricity, and water and 
sewage projects, which have noticeably come to a halt. The 
sources doubt that the Yemeni Government has resorted to 
borrowing from abroad to deal with the deficit that has 
afflicted the public budget, because relations with the lending 
nations that used to deal with Yemen are still angry about 
Yemen's position concerning the recent Gulf crisis (Iraq's 
occupation of Kuwait). Also, in the view of many of these 
nations, Yemen has become an oil-producing nation. Even when 
cooperation between Yemen and many of the nations and 
international organizations has continued, it is restricted to 
technical aid, consulting, [the acquisition of] special 
expertise, and some services projects, especially in the fields 
of public health, environmental health, etc. The sources 
considered that it is not possible, in any case, to hold any 
particular party responsible for the latest deficit afflicting 
the Yemeni public budget, in view of the fact that the fiscal 
and monetary policy does not differ much from that of the rest 
of the policies which have been followed by Yemen during its 
stage of unification. The government agencies have multiplied to 
an extent previously unknown in this country, and the Ministry 
of Finance, together with the Yemeni Central Bank, have been 
transformed into mere executive agencies who have no say in the 
formulation of policies and decisionmaking and cannot restrain 
the higher authorities that merely want to have their orders 
carried out without having to take into consideration the 
consequences of these orders--especially those dealing with the 
printing of more paper money to deal with ever-increasing 
expenditures. 
  The sources remember how the statements exchanged between 
the 
leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC], and those of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] contained accusations concerning 
fiscal policy, public expenditures, wasting money, and not 
adhering to the rules and clauses dealing with spending the 
public budget. The leaders of the GPC consider that the YSP is 
directly responsible, since the prime minister, who belongs to 
it, is responsible for the steadily increasing expenditures and 
the printing of more paper currency in order to cover the 
salaries, wages, and compensations being paid out in the 
southern provinces. The YSP leaders are saying that the salaries 
they are talking about in the PCG do not amount to anything in 
comparison with the unlimited expenditures of the nation's 
president and the Ministries of Defense and Interior, and, in 
this regard, they refer to what 'Ali Salim al-Bid recently 
mentioned concerning the fact that the Central Bank is being 
administered by telephone from the Presidential Palace. 
  Finally, the sources pointed out that the deficit that has 
afflicted Yemen's public budget is also the result of the fact 
that Yemeni society is accustomed to having the Public Treasury 
meet all of the expenditures. Recently some newspapers, by means 
of cartoons and satirical articles, have compared the treasury 
to a dairy cow that is expected to provide all the members of a 
family with what they need, without any serious thought being 
given to how to make it possible for the cow to always be able 
to do this.

<F P=106> [New Report: "CIA was Involved in Bombay Bomb Blasts"] </F>
  [Text] Bombay, 12 March. The CIA was involved in the 
dreadful violence and bomb blasts in Bombay after the 6 December 
1992 incident. This is the conclusion the Indian intelligence 
agencies have reached. According to the conclusions reached 
after confidential investigations, the CIA used the Pakistani 
intelligence agency, ISI, the Mafia gangs in Bombay, and some 
leaders for this purpose. 
  According to these sources, the CIA helped the communal 
organizations and the Mafia gangs with money and weapons. These 
sources revealed that the purpose for the dreadful violence and 
bomb blasts in Bombay was to sabotage the market here. they went 
as far as to say that the CIA is trying to split up India. These 
sources expressed the concern that Madras was the next target 
after the destruction in Bombay. 
  A red alert has been declared in the state after this 
information was received. The state government has issued a 
special appeal to the people to remain peaceful. According to 
these sources, the CIA is inciting innocent people in addition 
to using anti-social and communal elements to make its 
conspiracies successful. The intelligence agencies have prepared 
a list that includes names of important persons in politics and 
other fields. Their activities are being closely monitored now. 
  The intelligence agencies have collected all possible 
information related to the terrible riots in December 1992 and 
January 1993 as well as to the March bomb blasts. What happened 
in Bombay after 6 December was not coincidental. The plans to 
spread violence were made before 6 December. A local 
intelligence official was aware of a meeting held in a minority 
section of city to plan a strategy for spreading violence after 
the mosque was destroyed. However, he did not try to get 
information about the decisions made in that meeting. 
  The sources revealed that this plan to spread violence 
brought the Muslims who were wounded in the riots to public 
attention. The CIA had made plans to have the majority group 
commit violence in retaliation to the violent activities of the 
minority group. It has supplied weapons to both sides. It used 
communal organizations on both sides and anti-social elements 
for this purpose. 
  The widespread violence that the foreign powers had assumed 
would take place after the March bomb blasts did not take place. 
The sources said that additional violence did not occur because 
of the change in political atmosphere after the change in 
leadership and the measures taken after the police received 
additional information about riots. The CIA and the ISI worked 
together to provide finance and weapons for bomb blasts. In 
additional to the Mafia members, young people suffering from 
riots were used for this purpose. 
  The home and foreign ministries needed to work together to 
apprehend the real criminals behind that 12 March bomb blasts. 
The investigation was not very successful because of the lack of 
cooperation. That disheartened the investigating officials. 
High-level officials have said that the local communal 
organizations interfere in their efforts to foil CIA and ISI 
plans. Whenever plans to take serious action against anti-social 
elements are made, the related communal organizations raise a 
lot of hue and cry against it. 
  After last year's major bomb blasts, there were nine smaller 
blasts in public places in Bombay in August and September. The 
goal of these blasts was to spread fear among the people. The 
Bombay police arrested a Pakistani citizen trying to place a 
bomb in the Ahmedabad Janata Express at Bombay Central station. 
This member of the Jamaatul Mujaheddin is a resident of Lahore. 
Several persons suspected to be Kashmiri terrorists were also 
arrested in Bombay. 
  According to police sources, the BJP was planning a 
demonstration outside the Vidha Bhavan on 12 July 1993. At that 
time, some Bajrang Dal members with Indian-made revolvers were 
arrested. These people had threatened the minority community 
store owners. A similar incident took place on 6 December 1993 
when the All India Ulema-e Council had organized a strike. The 
police had expected communal hatred to erupt on both these 
occasions. One report recommended that the police should be 
fully prepared for every important religious holiday and minor 
confrontations.

<F P=106> [Article: "Government Accused of Aping the West"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Opposition members in the Lok 
Sabha today launched a blistering attack against the Government, 
accusing it of "blindly aping the west" and being "insensitive" 
to the pressing problems, including unemployment and poverty, 
confronting the nation. 
  Participating in the resumed debate on the motion of thanks 
on the President's address, Mr. Chandrajeet Yadav (JD) (Janata 
Dal) charged that by indiscriminately opening its doors to 
multinationals, the Congress Government had pushed the economy 
on the path of destruction. 
  He said this had also drastically affected the public sector 
and the cottage industry, with lakhs of people facing the gloomy 
prospects of unemployment. 
  The Janata Dal member said a "sense of uncertainty" 
prevailed 
throughout the country. The number of persons living below the 
poverty line had crossed 50 crores but little was being done to 
ameliorate their condition, he said. 
<H5>  `IMF Dictating Policies' </H5>
  Mr. B.N. Reddy (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist) 
attacked the Government for, what he called, bartering national 
interests, saying that the economic policy was being dictated by 
the IMF. 
  The (CPI-M) member wanted the Government to come out more 
firmly to tackle Pakistan's continued support and encouragement 
to terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Mr. A. Charles (Cong-I) made a strong defence of the 
Government policies and said it was to the credit of the Prime 
Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, who had managed to retrieve the 
economy which was in bad shape when the Congress(I) took over 
the reins of power. 
  He complimented the Government for its handling of the 
Hazratbal crisis which, he said, had been praised both at home 
and abroad. 
  Mr. D.D. Khanoria (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) made a 
strong plea for Central assistance to Himachal Pradesh to 
promote development. 
<H5>  `Credibility Restored' </H5>
  Dr. Ravi Mallu (Congress-I), supporting the motion, said the 
Government, under the Prime Ministership of Mr. Narasimha Rao, 
had restored the international credibility of the country as 
well as the economy. He said the President's address covered the 
various achievements of the Government and outlined the priority 
area of action in the coming years. 
  Mr. Ramesh Chand Tomar (BJP), opposing the motion, described 
the President's address as "directionless" and said the 
Government should not go ahead with the implementation of the 
Dunkel proposals as they would severely affect the farm 
economics and farmers. 
  He also criticised the Mulayam Sing Government of Uttar 
Pradesh, which, he said, was following casteist policies. 
  Mr. Tomar also attacked the economic policies of the 
Government, saying that it would breed large scale unemployment. 
<H5>  `Strategies Needed' </H5>
  Mr. Sharad Yadav (JD) said the Government should plan long 
term and short term strategies to meet the challenges facing the 
nation. 
  He spoke of economic and social inequalities and said that 
unless the nation was rid of poverty, communalism and casteism, 
it could not face the threat to its integrity and solidarity. 
  Mr. Yadav chided the Government for not responding 
adequately 
and immediately to the U.S. Government's provocative statements 
which had a bearing on the unity of the nation. 
  Mr. Haradhan Roy (CPI-M) criticised the Government's 
liberalisation policy and said this would totally eliminate the 
indigenous industry, whether in the public or private sector. 
  The status of India would be reduced to that of Hong Kong as 
the internal market would be flooded with foreign goods, he 
said. -- PTI

<F P=106> [Article: "Amanullah Khan, Pakistan Government Patch Up"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. After prolonged confrontation, 
the Pakistani Government and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation 
Front (JKLF) chief, Mr. Amanullah Khan, have patched up. 
  Though ideological differences over merger with Pakistan and 
"azadi" (freedom) remain, a tacit agreement has been arrived at 
between them on a policy of "non-interference." 
  Sources said Islamabad's role in getting Mr. Khan released 
in 
Belgium (he was arrested at the instance of India) helped in 
arriving at the understanding. 
  The absence of confrontation between the JKLF and the 
Pakistani Government in the early months of 1994, unlike in 
earlier years, is an expression of this compromise. 
  Relations between the JKLF and Islamabad had soured after 
Pakistan began providing material and moral support to groups 
such as the Hizbul Mujahideen and others which favour merger (of 
Kashmir) with Pakistan. After the "launch" of militancy by the 
JKLF, Pakistani intelligence found that the group had a mind of 
its own and would not budge from its pro-independence stance. 
  As a result, the JKLF was sidelined in the Kashmir valley, 
its supply of arms and ammunition was also cut off to the 
benefit of pro-Pakistani outfits which followed the "line" of 
the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan. 
  The JKLF then adopted an increasingly confrontationist 
attitude towards Islamabad. This was reflected in numerous 
marches to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). 
  The killing of JKLF cadre by Pakistani security forces 
resulted in a hardening of its approach towards Islamabad. In 
fact, at one time Mr. Javed Ahmed Mir, acting chief of the JKLF 
in the valley, had announced that a joint struggle for 
independence would have to be waged against both New Delhi and 
Islamabad. 
  The JKLF-Pakistani equation, punctuated with accusatory 
statements, has been relatively quiet this year, the sources say. 
  With most of the "actions" against the security forces in 
the 
Kashmir Valley being carried out by groups such as the Hizbul 
Mujahideen, the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and the Al Barq, the 
striking capabilities of the JKLF have been badly affected. 
  On the other hand, Pakistani intelligence agencies are aware 
that the Kashmiri sentiment is still, by and large, with the 
pro-independence JKLF and not with the groups propped up by it. 
It is these realities, the sources said, that have made the JKLF 
and the Pakistani Government aware of the mutual benefits of 
having a non-confrontationist relationship.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "India Will Foil Any </F>
Destabilisation Bid"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 21. While giving an optimistic 
account of the gains of the recent past in economic and 
political areas, the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, today noted 
with concern Pakistan's activities and their fall-out in the 
bilateral field. Pakistan's support to terrorism and subversion 
in Jammu and Kashmir and its anti-India activities world-wide 
had hampered seriously efforts at normalising relations, he said. 
  In his address to the members of the two Houses of 
Parliament, marking the beginning of the Budget session, Dr. 
Sharma recalled the Prime Minister's offer of dialogue to 
Pakistan, aimed at establishing good-neighbourly relations in 
terms of the Shimla Agreement. Bilateral talks had since taken 
place, he said, but the stridency of Pakistan's anti-India 
statements had grown, -- with its adverse consequences. He 
wanted Pakistan to give up its negative approach and reciprocate 
India's desire for normalising ties. 
  The President, obviously, had in mind Pakistan's anti-India 
move at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva as part of 
its efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue, affecting 
adversely the process of dialogue. 
  In a ringing categorical tone, the President observed: 
"Jammu 
and Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and we shall foil 
any attempt to destabilise it either from across the border or 
from any other quarter." This was not the first time that such a 
statement emanated from the top, but it had a special meaning 
now -- as a message to Pakistan in the midst of its stepped-up 
campaign to annex the State through devious, dishonest means, 
based on the human rights cry. 
  Dealing with firm steps by police and security forces to 
counter terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Sharma said "every 
effort is made to see that the maximum restraint is exercised on 
the use of force. Whenever there has been any incident 
suggesting excessive use of force, an inquiry has been promptly 
instituted and action taken." This was meant for those accusing 
India of human rights violations. 
  External relations accounted for a small portion of the 
President's address, but were the subject of sharp, specific, 
significant formulations. The reference to India's relations 
with the U.S., for instance, stressed the positive and not the 
negative which, as we know, had led to strains. Dealing with 
interaction with the U.S. in several areas, ranging from 
education and science and technology to culture and sports, and 
cooperation on the issue of a comprehensive test ban treaty, he 
said: "The response from the United States to our economic 
liberalisation policies had been very positive and the U.S. 
investments in India in the last two years were very 
substantial. We look forward to working with the United States 
towards mutual understanding, including on those issues on which 
such understanding needs enhancement. This will reflect the 
vibrant democratic and secular ideals of our two countries." 
  Then there was satisfaction over the course of relationship 
with China -- with particular reference to efforts for peace and 
tranquillity along the border -- with Russia -- "despite certain 
difficulties, cooperation in political, economic, commercial and 
other areas was sought to be promoted by both sides" -- the new 
era of cooperation with ASEAN, increased economic interaction 
with the Gulf countries and the European Union. 
  As regards the domestic scene, Dr. Sharma referred to steady 
progress on all fronts as evidenced by the improved law and 
order situation, a record foodgrain output, containment of the 
rate of inflation at a single digit level, comfortable foreign 
exchange reserves, reduction in the trade gap, buoyancy in 
exports, improved performance in essential areas of the 
infrastructural sector, and increased inflow of foreign 
investment. All these had symbolised and justified "this 
emerging optimism.... We have regained our elan internally and 
our confidence globally." The gains of last year in Punjab had 
been consolidated, he said. 
  As regards the Ayodhya issue, the President contrasted the 
situation at the beginning of last year with that obtaining now. 
"There was a great deal of concern over the possible fall-out of 
the demolition and the riots that followed. The grim predictions 
that were being made have proved wrong. The atmosphere has 
improved considerably and we can hope for a lasting solution to 
the dispute." The Government, according to him, "would take 
appropriate measures in the light of the opinion of the Supreme 
Court." 
  Dealing with economic reforms, the President referred to the 
momentum gained since 1991. Still much more needed to be done, 
he noted, adding: "The reform is an irreversible and continuous 
process and needs to be implemented with determination and 
foresight, keeping the responses and circumstances in the 
country constantly in view. We shall hasten with care."

<F P=106> [Article: "A Historic Resolution"] </F>
  [Text] History was written into the proceedings of 
Parliament when the two Houses unanimously passed a resolution 
reiterating the people's resolve to resist any attempts to 
separate Jammu and Kashmir from the rest of the country and 
condemning strongly the continued abetment and encouragement 
Pakistan was extending to subversive and terrorist activities in 
the State. In a rare exhibition of unanimity, members of 
Parliament belonging to various parties and groups had 
unequivocally and in the strongest terms told Pakistan that any 
attempt from any quarter to interfere in the internal affairs of 
India would be met resolutely. Coming at a time when Pakistan is 
trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue knowing full well 
that it was violating the Shimla agreement both in word and 
spirit and resolution adopted by Parliament should convince the 
outside world that Pakistan's anti-India campaign was going to 
achieve little. 
  The resolution also highlights the fact that sophisticated 
weapons were being supplied by Pakistan to the militants in 
Jammu and Kashmir and the main objective of the resolution was 
to expose this before the world. Pakistan must now understand 
that everyone in India knows for certain that it is the 
unconcealed sponsor of the armed struggle in Kashmir and all its 
efforts to grab the State by providing material help to the 
insurgents occasionally covering up its tracks if only to 
mislead the international community when it comes close to 
questioning the extent of involvement will come to nought. A few 
thousand mercenaries let loose by Pakistan can no doubt create 
havoc but to think that they can pin down a large Army and a 
determined people who are prepared to resist efforts to 
destabilise the State is nothing but foolish. Unfortunately the 
pro-Pakistani fighters have extended their area of operations to 
newer districts of Jammu and the administration which is engaged 
in tackling them has already registered some notable successes. 
  While the rise in the armed capabilities of the more extreme 
groups is essentially due to the lavish Pakistani sponsorship, 
Islamabad is never tired of talking about the violation of human 
rights in the sensitive State in order to divert the attention 
of the world community from reality. The Armed Forces and the 
paramilitary outfits dealing with an unrelenting enemy which is 
responsible for swelling the ranks of the fanatical militants 
have been showing tremendous restraint even if there have been 
occasional aberrations but to say there has been a largescale 
violation of human rights in the Indian State of Jammu and 
Kashmir is a travesty of truth. That much was proved during the 
recent visit to the State of four European envoys who reported 
that militancy was getting support from across the border. India 
must also resort to an effective campaign against Pakistan which 
is indulging in an intensive diplomatic offensive coupled with 
the instigation of more violence in the Valley with the sole 
objective of bringing the Kashmir situation back to the world's 
attention. Of course, Pakistan's domestic compulsions are also 
involved in its efforts to whip up anti-Indian feelings. Some 
of the revelations made by repentant militants about being 
ill-treated in Pakistani training camps must have opened the 
eyes of those who took to arms in a fit of misguided zeal. Now 
that the national consensus on Kashmir is very clear it should 
be obvious to Pakistan that it is well nigh impossible to even 
seek to dictate the agenda by remote control. It is now for New 
Delhi to evolve a game plan on Kashmir that enables it to win 
the battle for the hearts and minds of the people and brings 
into being a truly democratic structure to replace what looks 
like an embittered and traumatised security 
apparatus.

<F P=106> [Excerpt From Article by P.S. Suryanarayana: "Pakistan Move </F>
Puts Kashmiris on Centre stage"] 
  [Excerpt] Dr. Farooq Abdullah, on the other hand, 
emphasised the critical relevance of a tranquil Jammu and 
Kashmir to Indo-Pakistan relations and to the secular traditions 
of India. 
  In an interview in Geneva to a Pakistani newspaper, THE 
NATION, Dr. Abdullah said: "Kashmir should be the bridge of 
friendship between India and Pakistan, not a battleground for 
their destruction." 
  Asked if the Kashmiris should be held "hostage" to the cause 
of the Indian Muslims, he said: "When Pakistan was made, did you 
think about the Indian Muslims or as to the tragedies that might 
befall them? No. You just took a chunk of India thinking "well, 
we have got our homeland, let these people go to hell or 
wherever they have to go. We are not bothered about them." ... 
"I think I would not like to see the blood of 200 million people 
on my hands." 
  On whether the future of Indian Muslims would depend on what 
might happen in Kashmir, Dr. Abdullah said: "The very fact of 
secular India depends on the crown of India which is Kashmir. 
The strongest pillar of that (Indian secularism) is Kashmir, 
whether you like it or whether I like it. It is there and that 
is what is going to maintain the secular character of India." 
  As for the political future of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. 
Abdullah said the existing Line of Actual Control (LAC) should 
be "made into an international boundary," with both India and 
Pakistan retaining the portions now under their respective 
control. He also wanted Pakistan to give to the people of Jammu 
and Kashmir on its side the same rights that "India is going to 
give to this part." "That way," according to him, "neither 
Pakistan will feel defeated nor India." He also expressed 
readiness to talk to the Kashmiri leaders on the Pakistani side 
within this framework of ideas. Dr. Abdullah did not wish to 
make any distinction between Kashmiri Muslims and the Hindus and 
other religious groups of the State. 
  He also spoke of the "training" given by Pakistan to the 
Kashmiri youth and of "a number of instances where (the Indian) 
security forces have lost their control and cool" in dealing 
with the "terrorists." He did not want the northern territory to 
be excluded from any settlement of the Indo-Pakistan 
"territorial dispute" over Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Excerpts of Sharad Pawar Interview by Mahesh Vijapurkar: </F>
"Ready To Work for Party: Pawar"] 
  [Text] Bombay, March 7. The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. 
Sharad Pawar, has stressed the need for the Congress to dispel 
the impression that it was only chasing after power. Congressmen 
should work hard to regain the confidence of the people. "The 
time has come for the party functionaries to volunteer for 
organisational work." I will be the happiest person to take up 
any responsibility," he said in an interview to THE HINDU 
excerpts from which [as published] been published yesterday. The 
following are more questions and answers. 
  Q: You were once credited with the idea that those in 
Government give up power..... 
  No, I am not speaking of another Kamaraj Plan. I had 
definitely suggested that our position has reached such a state 
in some areas that unless we work very hard, we will not be able 
to enthuse the party workers and regain the confidence of the 
public. We should make the people realise that we are serious. 
There is an impression that we are here only for the sake of 
power. We have to act to prove that power is only one important 
instrument to deliver the goods and there are Congressmen who 
are not chasing power but wish to give a stable government, 
stability to the country and a proper direction to the 
Government. If the Congress is weakened, the nation will be 
weakened. If there is no strong Government in Delhi, the 
country's economy would be hurt. 
  Without a proper environment, its health would deteriorate, 
affecting the common man. It is the party's moral duty to keep 
this country together, keep a stable government at the national 
and State levels and see that the economic health improves. If 
this has to be achieved I think the time has come for many 
important party functionaries to forget other things, including 
power for some time and concentrate on the party by volunteering 
themselves for organisational work. I will be the happiest 
person to take up any responsibility like this. 
  Q: Will persons come forward? 
  There are many who are ready to work, are in a position to 
deliver the goods. If this kind of suggestion comes from the 
party leadership, I think there are many leaders who will 
respond. 
  Q: The economic reforms are in place. You have listed the 
problems, you have suggested what attitude is required. What is 
the specific programme to deliver the goods? 
  If the Congress were to discuss and decide some definite 
programme...but how? To rebuild, go to the masses. There should 
be more mass contact. Go and listen to the hostile people. Have 
to go into details to understand why the hostility. 
  Q: In effect, is it like having to almost start a new party? 
  Yes, in some areas, it is like that. In the Hindi belt we 
have to work like that. 
  Q: You once floated the idea of wider consultations to get 
the party back to its healthy bounce. What happened to that? 
  It was discussed and decided that there should be a broader 
meeting, beyond an extended CWC [Congress Working Committee], of 
100 to 200 people from all over the country for a Narora-type 
session, to assess the situation and finalise the programme. Our 
colleagues in CWC are thinking on those lines. These kind of 
camps could give a definite direction. Then the question would 
arise: who will execute the task? Then the question will be 
about who will give time and not expect anything in return? I 
think a lot of people will respond within the Congress party. 
<H5>  Collective Action </H5>
  Q: A lot of people will have to respond since the party is 
not the same as it was in its earlier phases, not specifically 
controlled by an individual... 
  The situation is definitely changing. No individual can do 
all this. There has to be collective action. There has to be a 
team and there has to be a leadership like that of Narasimha 
Rao, who has to give direction to the team. 
  Q: The solution lies in collective action emerging under the 
direction of the party president? 
  That is right. 
  Q. Has it been missing for some time, maybe one or two 
years? 
  I don't say missing, but we are not going on those lines. 
That thinking is there, that feeling is there but no action on 
those lines. 
  Q: This lack of action cannot be the character of the 
Congress, which normally sets much store by its own survival 
regardless of... 
  You see, though Congressmen are generally inclined to work, 
unfortunately, this time what has happened is that the 
traditional bases of the party have been wiped out...the 
minorities, SCs [Scheduled Castes], STs [Scheduled Tribes], 
backward classes, the middle classes, the brahmins in UP [Uttar 
Pradesh]. They have deserted us. And we are not ready to pay a 
serious thought why they have deserted. Karunakaran and 
Janardhan Reddy Committees have given their report. I read it in 
the newspapers but have no official copy. I think we have to go 
into details, repair things, because there is no choice. 
  Q: Do you agree with the tone and content of the report? 
  I have not read it. The tone of the newspapers is motivated. 
Just to write against me. It is the tone of the person who 
briefed. His tone was perceptible in the reports. Some of the 
members of the committee have said we have not discussed this. 
We discussed poll outcome with 700 persons.....It is not 
important. Except for one or two persons who may have said 
something. It is not important, there may be some sentences here 
and there. They said it was not the committee's contention. Some 
of the members have told me that. 
  Q: The time and effort needed to build the party in time for 
the polls would be....? 
  We are not in a position to wait for years. We have to act 
immediately since we have to face the Lok Sabha elections in 
1996 and get people's support. That is an immediate task. The 
other side is to rebuild the organisation at various levels. It 
may take two, three years, maybe even five years. 
  Q: When the bottomline has to evolve, some major decisions 
would have to be taken. Do you think CWC will rise to the 
occasion? 
  It has to. It is the question of next two, three weeks. 
Major 
decisions on organisation have to be taken. What is happening 
today is that when Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh are taking 
decisions and there is some acceptance, though it has led -- 
some rise in prices -- people are suffering they also feel this 
is a proper direction. But this is what the Government is doing. 
That is not enough. I have seen in China, where communism has 
been continuously propagated in the past, that the whole nation 
is talking about economic reforms, and that is because the party 
has taken up that challenge. It has created that atmosphere. 
Take any person, landless labour, factory worker or a jawan of 
the PLA [People's Liberation Army], everybody discusses 
restructuring of economy. Because the party has taken the job on 
hand. Here the Government has done everything and as Congressmen 
we could not create that kind of favourable atmosphere for the 
reforms and there is a gap. Who has read Dunkel carefully? Are 
we to isolate ourselves from the global community? In national 
interest we have to sit with others in a shrinking world, 
everyone coming together. We cannot escape from the changes. 
There is no deliberate gap but there is no effort. We are the 
people who are responsible for it. All leaders at all levels. We 
have to go to the people and explain to them. If we talk, people 
respond, they are happy with the changes. People have to take 
the party president more seriously.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Small May Be Dispensed With"] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Manmohan Singh has kept his word! 
He had promised to continue "the process of lowering (excise) 
rates when they become unduly high"; it appears prominently on 
the budget giveaways that had accounted for a respectable Rs. 
2000 [rupees] crore. What was overlooked was the fine print that 
the budget has reduced "the number of special exemption 
notifications by about half." It now appears that most of the 
383 notifications rescinding exemptions relate to small-scale 
units. Manmohan Singh had stressed, at least twice that the 
budget was going all out to fulfil "major" and "persistent" 
demands of small-scale industry. This assurance seems to have 
gone by the wayside. He has little time for the problems of the 
unglamorous common man. 
  The duty payable by small units producing steel utensils, 
rubber chappals [sandals], canvas shoes, or paper boards from 
bagasse goes up from nil to 15 percent ad valorem. That the net 
tax is covered by a special plan called Modavat is no 
consolation. The small producers have to coax suppliers of 
inputs to issue receipts, a difficult task in a climate of 
rampant sales-tax evasion. Duty discounts will not be easy to 
claim. In truth, often nonpayment of sales tax on inputs is what 
becomes the survival margin of small producers. Maintaining 
books of accounts to the satisfaction of excise inspectors with 
itchy palms, can be costly, if not cumbersome. Under the 
exemption regime, it is also superfluous. 
  There is a puzzling contrariness in the new excise strategy. 
Excise has been raised from 15 percent in 1993-94 to a stiff 20 
percent on small-scale registered production while the 
unregistered units with a clearance value of up to Rs. 7,500,000 
have been excused, thus encouraging benami [illegal] whales in 
the business to acquire their ownership.

<F P=106> [Article: "CPI Meet To Check Further Defections"] </F>
  [Text] Lucknow, March 7. The Communist Party of India 
[CPI], shocked by the defection of two of its four legislators 
in Uttar Pradesh on Friday last, has initiated a new political 
exercise to protect the party from any further damage. Last 
week's developments were indicative of the uneasiness prevailing 
in Communist circles for quite some time over their political 
alliance in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh]. While the national party 
leadership sided with the Janata Dal in the last elections the 
state CPI leaders felt a better choice would have been the 
Samajwadi Party of Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, who had shown 
"greater stamina to fight the fascist forces represented by the 
BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)." The party State executive which 
is meeting here on Wednesday to take a fresh look at the latest 
developments is likely to discuss the issue in detail. 
  Some senior CPI leaders have even questioned the bonafides 
of 
the Janata Dal leader, Mr. V.P. Singh, as a person wedded to the 
ideal of secularism. It was Mr. Singh himself who had allowed 
the BJP president, Mr. Lal Krishna Advania, to take out his 
`Rathyatra'in 1989 that ultimately resulted in spreading 
communalism to a number of States. As against this Mr. Mulayam 
Singh Yadav had stood firm and ordered firing on `kar sewaks' 
when they tried to storm the disputed structure at Ayodhya on 
October 31 and November 2, 1989. 
  The State unit of the party is expected to drive home its 
point more effectively on this political question and also to 
convince the national leadership of the efficacy of their line. 
  However, the recent organisational demoralisation in the CPI 
does not seem to be influenced by ideological factors. The 
emergence of the Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party combine in 
the last elections, mainly because of voting patterns influenced 
by caste lines, unnerved even hardened workers as caste loyalty 
proved stronger than ideological considerations. Extending 
support to the Samajwadi Party may thus become crucial for the 
CPI, otherwise its influence might be further eroded in pockets 
where it had succeeded in making some base during the past 
several decades. 
  The veteran Communist leader, Dr. Z.A. Ahmed, has meanwhile 
denied that he had resigned from the CPI and joined the 
Samajwadi Party. His name was among the five U.P. CPI leaders 
mentioned in a press release distributed by Mr. Mitrasen Yadav, 
MLA [member of Legistaive Assembly], which informed that they 
had deserted the communist organisation. Dr. Ahmed has, however, 
added that Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, was the best person to lead 
the fight against fascist forces in U.P. He pleaded for a 
broader base of secular forces to continue this fight against 
fascism. 
  The CPI MLA, Mr. Udal, said the decisions taken by Mr. 
Mitrasen Yadav and Mr. Ramchandra Bux Singh to resign from the 
CPI and join the Samajwadi Party were their individual decisions 
and these would not affect the affairs in the organisations. 
Desertions by the two legislators were their individual attempts 
for adjustments with power and had no ideological basis, he 
added.

<F P=106> [Article: "Mulayam Keeps Cool Despite Provocation"; all </F>
quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Patna, March 7. What impressed the people most about 
the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, 
during his two-day visit here, apart from his simplicity and 
unassuming manners, was that he scrupulously refrained from 
attacking any political party or leader. 
  The gesture was, however, not reciprocated by his Bihar 
counterpart, Mr. Lallu Prasad Yadav, and his colleagues, none of 
whom, barring the dissident Cooperative Minister, Mr. Ramdeo 
Singh Yadav, showed the usual courtesy of receiving the visiting 
Chief Minister as they did when the West Bengal Chief Minister, 
Mr. Jyoti Basu, came here recently. 
  As though this was not enough, a procession of so-called 
Dalits, organised obviously at the behest of the establishment, 
held up the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's motorcade. Also, 
derogatory slogans were raised against the former Chief Minister 
and Scheduled Caste leader, Mr. Ram Sundar Das, whose Loktantrik 
Samajwadi Party merged on Sunday with the Samajwadi party. 
  Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, on his part, showed restraint and 
political finesse. When, at a dinner meeting at the residence of 
Mr. Kapildeo Singh, national general secretary of the Samajwadi 
party, Mr. Ramdeo Singh Yadav presented a list of 57 ruling 
Janata Dal MLAs (Members of Legislative Assembly), including 28 
Ministers, who, he claimed, were ready to break away from the 
party, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister counselled patience. 
`Let us wait for the opportune moment and devote our energies to 
strengthening the Samajwadi party.' 
  That Mr. Ram Sundar Das has assumed a key role in the 
political calculations of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, so 
far as Bihar is concerned, and that gate crashers with dubious 
antecedents such as Mr. Pappu Yadav, MLA, detained once under 
the Crime Control Act, would find no place in the party, were 
clear from the tone and tenor of Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav's 
utterances at the merger meeting. 
  The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, according to sources close 
to him, was annoyed at slogans -- `Pappu-Mulayam zindabad and 
Bihar needs a leader like Pappu' -- raised at a civic reception 
according to him, albeit out of courtesy he did go to Mr. Pappu 
Yadav's residence to wish him and his bride a happy married life.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Tourism Minister, Mr. Ghulam 
Nabi Azad, has assured the international tourism industry that 
the Government had removed the major irritants hindering the 
growth of tourism. 
  Speaking at an `India Evening' at International Tourismus 
Borse (International Tourism Exchange Fair) Berlin last evening, 
Mr. Azad said that investors were looking towards India with a 
renewed interest. This had led to the clearing of projects 
involving an investment of $220 millions during last one year. 
He hoped that during the fair more deals would materialise with 
the representatives from the tourism trade of the developed 
countries getting to know more about Indian destinations. 
  He talked about efforts being made to improve tourist 
facilities and augment the number of hotel rooms. The air 
services had been improved and private airlines and air taxis 
allowed to operate. The Air Corporation Act had been repealed 
for a faster growth and to make more tourist destinations 
accessible by air.

<F P=106> [Article: "Chandra Shekhar Sees Threat From GATT"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The former Prime Minister and 
Samajwadi Janata Party leader, Mr. Chandra Shekhar, today 
reiterated his opposition to the new economic policies and 
threatened to launch a campaign against the new GATT (General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) regulations throughout the 
country. To begin with, the party will hold a rally in the 
Capital on March 18, the concluding day of the Budget session of 
Parliament. 
  Addressing a press conference here today, Mr. Chandra 
Shekhar 
said the Government's acceptance in principle of the new GATT 
regulation was a logical culmination of the policy of 
liberalisation initiated in the early Eighties. Dismissing the 
contention by senior Ministers that the Government's 
representatives in the Uruguay Round had done their best, Mr. 
Chandra Shekhar said the new regulations would "jeopardise the 
nation's sovereignty and integrity." 
  Seeking to draw parallels with the experience of the former 
Soviet Union, Mr. Chandra Shekhar said the pressures form the 
industrialised West could even lead to the "disintegration of 
the country." 
  "Nowhere has the surrender of sovereignty been so total and 
the sacrifice of national interest so brazen as in the case of 
the Government agreeing to the Dunkel Draft." 
  Stressing the need for popular resistance to the Government, 
Mr. Chandra Shekhar said that while he welcomed all shades of 
political opinion in the resistance movement, he wanted the BJP 
(Bharatiya Janata Party) to be kept away. "Their swadeshi slogan 
now and their total support to the new economic policies when it 
was announced in Parliament do not get along with each other," 
he added. 
  Referring to the Janata Dal, the former Prime Minister 
sought 
to blame the V.P. Singh camp for having rejected his appeal for 
unity of the Dals. Asked whether he would participate in the 
`gherao of Parliament' proposed by the Janata Dal, the former 
Prime Minister answered in the negative. 
  Mr. Chandra Shekhar made it plain today that since the 
Janata 
Dal had rejected the Ghaziabad unity proposal of the various Dal 
factions, he was left with the only option of reviving his 
Samajwadi Janata Party.

<F P=106> [Article: "Limited Role for Foreigners in Private Banks"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Government today assured the 
Rajya Sabha that foreigners will not be allowed to control the 
private banks that are proposed to be set up in the country. 
  Replying to the brief debate on the Banking Regulation 
(amendment) Bill, 1994, which the House approved after a 
division, the Minister of State for Finance, Dr. Abrar Ahmed, 
said that under the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India the 
proposed private banks could not hold more than 20 per cent of 
the capital. Non-Resident Indians could have 40 per cent of the 
total capital, he said. 
  The Minister said the provision of appointing part time 
chairmen for the proposed banks would be confined to the private 
banks and the nationalised banks did not come under its purview. 
  He said the loss-making bank branches operating in the rural 
areas would not be closed down. 
  "The Reserve Bank had so far permitted nine banks to be 
established in the private sector and one of them had been 
issued a licence. 
  Adequate measures had been taken to ensure safety of the 
deposits in such banks," he said. 
<H5>  BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] Abstains </H5>
  The Rajya Sabha passed the Bill 1994 by 61 to 26 votes in an 
Opposition-pressed division in which, however, the Bharatiya 
Janata Party did not participate. 
  The BJP members, during the discussion on the Bill, opposed 
several provisions in it and also the ordinance promulgated in 
this connection before the budget session of Parliament began. 
  Earlier, the House rejected by voice vote the statutory 
resolution moved by Mr. Viren Saha (BJP) and others for the 
disapproval of the January 31 ordinance. 
  The Bill also replaces the ordinance. 
<H5>  `Provisions Will Not Be Misused' </H5>
  Dr. Abrar Ahmed assured the House that the provision for 
appointment of a part-time chairman in the private banks would 
not be misused. 
  He said the Government in no way would be involved in the 
process as these appointments would be made by the private banks 
themselves. However, he said, these appointments would be 
ratified by the Reserve Bank of India. 
  Referring to steps being taken to improve the banking 
system, 
the Minister said the Government had taken measures to 
strengthen the capital adequacy norms of the banks. 
<H5>  Computerisation </H5>
  Referring to the need for improving the quality of services 
rendered by the nationalised banks, the Minister said the 
Government was committed to computerisation of the banking 
operation, which would help in improving the efficiency of the 
banks. 
  In this context, he said the Government was in constant 
touch 
with the union representatives for implementing the 
computerisation programmes. 
  Regarding the closure of loss-making branches of 
nationalised 
banks, Dr. Ahmed said that as many as 102 branches had been 
identified by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) for closure. 
  However, he assured the members that none of these 
identified 
branches in rural areas would be closed and no bank employee 
would be retrenched. 
<H5>  Opposition Charge </H5>
  Earlier, participating in the discussion, the Opposition 
members charged the Government with bringing the privatisation 
in the banking sector under the "alibi" of inefficiency in the 
public sector banks and at the behest of the International 
Monetary Fund. 
  Members from Left parties, the Janata Dal and the BJP 
expressed apprehension that the reforms in the banking sector 
would only benefit the rich and would entirely ignore the poor 
population in both rural and urban areas. 
  The members also severely criticised the Government for its 
frequent resort to issuing ordinance, bypassing Parliament. 
  Mr. Viren Shah of the BJP questioned the hurry for the 
ordinance when Parliament was to meet in three weeks' time. He 
moved the statutory resolution disapproving of the ordinance. 
<H5>  Ordinance Questioned </H5>
  Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist), 
said the Narasimham committee report was out in December 1991 
and the Government waited for two years to take action on the 
report. He said he was unable to fathom the `sudden rush' to 
issue the ordinance as if without it the whole banking 
operations would have come to a standstill. 
  Were any of the provisions in the ordinance implemented till 
now? he asked and said that according to him nothing had been 
done till today. 
  Describing the Narasimham committee as the "local surrogate 
of the IMF," Dr. Mitra said the amendment of the Bill was being 
done at the behest of the international financial institutions.

<F P=106> [Article by Leo: "Spate of Preferential Offers and Euro </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] The rush is now for raising resources through the 
issue of equity shares at a premium under preferential offers to 
foreign institutional investors. Euro issues also have become 
popular and an amount of $1 billion has already been raised and 
another $1.5 billions can be secured in the coming months if all 
the contemplated issues fructify. Preferential offers have 
lately been more popular as it is easy to conclude arrangements 
for private placements after getting the approval of the 
shareholders. On the basis of existing guidelines, the highest 
quotation for the related equity shares in a period of six 
months prior to the date of decision to make the preferential 
offer will be the price for the equity shares involved. Vast 
resources are thus being mobilised in a manner which could not 
have been visualised even in the middle of last year. 
  As already stated, one can have a stake up to 24 per cent in 
the enlarged equity capital through preferential offers and 
holdings already secured through purchases from the open market 
or otherwise will have to be taken into account for this 
purpose. Since the allocations to different institutions give 
rise to problems, efforts are being made to sort out them. 
However, it is being examined by the monetary authorities 
whether it is desirable to have a big increase in the stake of 
foreign interests in equity capital of Indian enterprises when 
there is no need for incurring heavy capital expenditure on 
ongoing and new schemes. Also, the allotment of equity shares 
against preferential offers in Indian currency will create an 
obligation for the country to find the required forex [foreign 
exchange] resources if at a later date the proceeds from sale of 
equity shares now being allotted have to be repatriated by Flls 
[NRIs--nonresident Indians]. There will, of course, be a drain 
of forex resources only if sales exceeded fresh purchases. 
  RBI [Reserve Bank of India] Examining Impact of Recent 
Developments 
  In the case of Euro issues, however, there will be an 
initial 
inflow of forex resources directly. (Even in respect of 
preferential offers to Flls there would have been an earlier 
inflow of foreign exchange though recycling may not result in an 
immediate inflow of forex resources). Here again considerably 
larger amounts on foreign exchange will have to be found if 
equity shares so allotted appreciated substantially over a 
period and sales by foreign investors or Flls exceed current 
purchases. Various aspects will, therefore, have to be 
carefully examined for determining the balance of advantage 
accruing to the economy. However, the enterprises gathering 
additional resources in this way stand to gain considerably and 
it is now being discussed in market circles to what extent there 
will be an increase in the net profit, before depreciation and 
taxation, as a result of a lower burden of interest charges even 
without any change in the gross profit, before depreciation and 
interest charges. 
  SPIC to Issue Euro Convertible Bonds 
  Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC) is 
again 
seeking to raise $80 millions this time through Euro convertible 
bonds for taking advantage of the opportunity for repaying loans 
in foreign currencies on costlier terms taken for acquiring 
ships for handling liquid chemicals. It is also intended to 
utilise a portion for investment in an urea plant in West Asia 
and on new projects that may be promoted for producing polyester 
filament yarn and purified teraphthalic acid within the country. 
The financing of the ongoing schemes can be easily attempted as 
it is now expected that the drug project in Cuddalore will be 
commencing production of G. Penncillin towards the close of this 
year. The modernisation of the ammonia plant and related assets 
is also making satisfactory progress. 
  Novel Features and Options 
  The Euro convertible bonds that may be issued can be on 
attractive terms for the management if it is eventually decided 
to allot equity shares against these bonds at a high premium 
later at the option of the management. The lenders also can 
elect to get allotted equity shares within a stipulated period. 
In that event, the equity capital will get again enlarged and 
foreign ownership may rise to 48 per cent eventually if all the 
holders of Euro convertible bonds exercise their option to 
secure equity shares. The rise in percentage may be less 
pronounced if a much higher premium is realised. 
  It has been explained by Mr. A.C. Muthiah, Vice Chairman and 
President, that the total resources for nearly $155 millions 
will be improving considerably the financial position of the 
company and bringing about a considerable reduction in the 
burden of interest charges. The issue of GDRs [expansion not 
given] for $74.75 millions equivalent to Rs. 235 crores was made 
at a time when the quotations for equity shares were much lower 
than they are now. There was thus an increase in the equity 
capital by Rs. 33.52 crores to Rs. 88.04 crores from Rs. 54.52 
crores. The premium realised on "allotment" of equity shares was 
Rs. 200.97 crores. 
  Earlier, the paid up capital had increased to Rs. 54.52 
crores from Rs. 34 crores as a result of allotment of equity 
shares against zero bonds. The premium realised was Rs. 27.04 
crores. Total reserves, including share premium and excluding 
revaluation reserve, are now Rs. 360.04 crores. Euro-convertible 
bonds will result in a further increase in equity capital and 
the stake of the promoters in enlarged equity capital will tend 
to decline. 
  New Projects on Anvil 
  In order to retain the existing percentage in the enlarged 
equity capital, it is proposed to issue warrants to the 
promoters for enabling them to get 23 million equity shares at a 
premium, which may be determined on the basis of SEBI 
[Securities and Exchange Board of India] guidelines. These 
warrants may be encashed by the promoter group in the light of 
holders of Euro convertible bonds exercising their option to get 
allotted equity shares or the directors taking advantage of the 
opportunity for minimising addition to equity capital in the 
event of conversion with the realisation of a higher premium. 
The details relating to terms of the issue will be known after 
the negotiations are completed.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Opposition members in the Rajya 
Sabha, particularly the Janata Dal and the CPI (Communist Party 
of India) today objected to the Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan 
Singh, making a statement in Patiala about the acceptance of the 
recommendations of the Malhotra Committee, which went into the 
issue of restructuring the insurance sector. 
  Raising the matter during zero hour, Mr. Jaipal Reddy, JD 
(Janata Dal), said the Finance Minister had said in the course 
of his budget speech that the Malhotra Committee recommendations 
were under the active consideration of the Government. 
  When Parliament was in session, the Finance Minister had 
announced in Patiala that most of the committee's 
recommendations had been accepted. 
  Saying that the Finance Minister should have informed 
Parliament first, Mr. Reddy said he had committed contempt of 
Parliament. 
  Mr. Reddy was strongly supported by Mr. M.A. Baby, CPI(M), 
who said the Minister should not have made the statement outside 
Parliament. -- PTI

<F P=106> [Article: "Indigenous Newsprint Industry Facing Crisis"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Janata Dal member, Mr. 
Sharad Yadav, today drew the attention of the Government in the 
Lok Sabha to the crisis caused in the indigenous newsprint 
industry because of the relaxation in excise duty on foreign 
newsprint. 
  Raising the issue during zero hour, Mr. Yadav said India 
needed 5.5 lakh tonnes of newsprint and it was met by indigenous 
production. Only one lakh tonnes was required from abroad. 
Because of excise duty cuts, about three lakh tonnes of 
newsprint had been imported and that had resulted in stockpiling 
of 40,000 tonnes. 
  Mr. Yadav said that while Rs. 450 crores worth of foreign 
exchange was being spent the inflow had caused distress among 
the indigenous mills.

<F P=106> [Article: "PAC Raps Finance Ministry for `Lapses'"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Public Accounts Committee 
[PAC] has indicted the Union Finance Ministry for not having 
carried out a "meaningful probe" in a case of unauthorised 
import and under-invoicing by Reliance Industries. The case 
involves customs duty of Rs. 119.64 crores on goods imported by 
the company for its Patalganga polyester filament yarn project 
in Maharashtra. The allegation of unauthorised import of plant 
and machinery, misdeclaration and underinvoicing of goods was 
made in a showcause notice issued by the Customs Department in 
1987. 
  The PAC, presided over by Mr. Bhagwan Shankar Rawat (BJP) 
(Bharatiya Janata Party), pointed out that the report submitted 
by the Director-General Inspection (Customs and Excise) "does 
not inspire confidence" while the Finance Ministry has not 
undertaken any meaningful probe on the lines recommended by the 
committee earlier. It therefore urged the Ministry to re-examine 
the whole issue to check "any unhealthy practices in the 
department." 
  The committee submitted its 61st report today to both Houses 
on Government's action on the 164th report which had recommended 
a thorough probe into the entire issue. 
<H5>  Decision Delayed </H5>
  The PAC observes that the case pending since April, 1989, 
before the Customs, Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal 
(CEGAT) has not been decided even after a lapse of over four 
years. It was following the committee's recommendations that the 
Government had filed a review petition against the adjudicating 
order passed in January, 1989, dropping the charges contained in 
the showcause notice issued against the company in February, 
1987. 
  The PAC notes that the stay order obtained by the company 
against the proceedings in CEGAT has since been vacated and the 
matter is said to be pending before the Tribunal for a final 
decision. But the committee felt this was another instance of an 
importer resorting to tactics of successfully buying time for 
paying huge amounts of customs duty. It has, therefore, urged 
that the matter be thoroughly examined and effective measures 
evolved to ensure that Government's legitimate dues are 
recovered in time. 
  In the previous report, it was noted that Reliance 
Industries 
had registered three project contracts with the Bombay Custom 
House for availing of concessional duty rates. It was found that 
against the prescribed time limit of 15 days of the import of 
the last consignments, the company was allowed a period of four 
years and two months for the first contract, nine months for the 
second contract, and nearly a year and one month for the third 
contract to file reconciliation statements. The PAC had urged 
that the circumstances in which the company was permitted to 
submit reconciliation statements in this manner be thoroughly 
probed and responsibility fixed for the "undue favour." 
  The Department of Revenue in the Finance Ministry, in its 
reply to the PAC on this issue, said it had been studied by the 
Director General of Inspection (Customs and Central Excise). His 
report revealed that the file remained in the Custom House 
unattended for two years and five months in the first case, nine 
months in the second case and 10 months in the third case. The 
Director-General concluded that while there was administrative 
slackness, there did not appear to be any `motivated delay' by 
Customs officials. 
  On fixing of responsibility, the Central Board of Excise and 
Customs felt that work of this nature "tends to fall in arrears" 
owing to acute staff shortage. In this case, though delayed, 
corrective action has been taken by issue of show cause notice, 
it was pointed out. Besides, fresh instructions have been issued 
to Collectors of Customs to ensure that reconciliation 
statements are submitted by importers within the prescribed 
period and to enforce bonds where these are not submitted within 
the stipulated time.

<F P=106> [Article: "Speaker Seeks Statement on NTC"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr. 
Shivraj Patil, today directed the Government to make a statement 
as an agitated Opposition voiced fears that several lakh workers 
would lose jobs as the crisis-ridden National Textiles 
Corporation Mills [NTC] were on the verge of closure. 
  Raising the matter during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Mr. 
Ram 
Naik (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) said 11 NTC mills closed 
down yesterday in Bombay as power supply was disconnected for 
non-payment of bills. 
  The plight of the NTC workers in West Bengal was highlighted 
by Mr. Sudarshan Roy Chaudhary, CPI(M) (Communist Party of 
India-Marxist). He contended that about 1.60 lakh workers in the 
State would stop getting their salaries from April one as the 
NTC Mills would receive Rs. 10 [rupees] lakhs from the Centre as 
against an expenditure of Rs. 30 crores. 
  Mr. Harin Pathak, a BJP member for Gujarat, said 1.5 lakh 
employees in the powerloom and handloom sectors had gone on 
strike protesting against a 10 per cent increase in excise duty 
on cotton and polyester yarn.

<F P=106> [Article: "Combined Onslaught by Opposition"; all quotation </F>
marks as published] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 21. The recent price hike saw the 
Opposition in full cry today as Parliament began its Budget 
session with a boycott of the President's address by the 
National Front and Left parties, and a BJP-led (Bharatiya Janata 
Party) walkout in both Houses. The Opposition leaders, cutting 
across party lines, accused the Government of attempting to 
"bypass" Parliament by raising prices on the eve of the Budget. 
  After the NF-Left (National Front) alliance had set the ball 
rolling in the morning by staying away from the President, Dr. 
Shankar Dayal Sharma's address in the Central Hall of 
Parliament, the BJP launched the second offensive when the two 
Houses later met separately. The walkout in the Lok Sabha was 
led by the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, 
and by his counterpart, Mr. Sikander Bakht, in the Rajya Sabha. 
  The Government was clearly on the defensive, as the 
Opposition repeatedly charged it with "lowering" the dignity of 
Parliament and of rendering the Budget presentation 
"meaningless." Some Congress(I) members in both the Houses tried 
bravely to take on the Opposition, but quickly retreated in the 
face of a sharp counter-attack. 
  The "action" began as soon as members returned to their 
respective Houses after the joint sitting. In the Lok Sabha, Mr. 
Vajpayee rose to protest against the price hikes immediately 
after the House had made obituary references to its five former 
members who died recently, and the Prime Minister had introduced 
the two new Ministers -- Mr. Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav and Dr. C. 
Silvera. 
  `Budget rendered meaningless': Mr. Vajpayee 
pointed out that the Budget presentation had a certain 
"sanctity" about it, and the people waited for it with a sense 
of anticipation. By raising prices of a wide range of essential 
commodities, a few weeks before the Budget, the Government had 
rendered the Budget "meaningless." 
  Charging the Government with having committed an 
impropriety, 
Mr. Vajpayee urged the Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, to pull up 
the Government. What the Government had done amounted to an 
"insult" to Parliament, he argued, insisting on a ruling from 
the Speaker and warning the Treasury benches that the Opposition 
would not let them get away with it. The ruling party may have 
managed a majority in the House, but this did not mean that it 
could ignore Parliament.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "TADA Is Valid, But..."] </F>
  [Text] The Supreme Court, while upholding the 
constitutional validity of the Terrorism And Disruptive 
Activities Act [TADA] has also called for a review of all TADA 
cases. When TADA was debated in Parliament in 1987, there was a 
huge outcry describing it as a draconian law. In 1991, when the 
Act came up for renewal, the opposition was muted; something 
must have happened to show the civil libertarians the 
uselessness of shedding tears for terrorists. People of Punjab 
have shown that civil society is willing to pay the heavy price 
required to maintain peace. And this is the logic behind public 
endorsement of TADA. Going for the substance, the Supreme Court 
has lamented that the scope of TADA has not been progressively 
reduced but has rather increased. Since less than 1 percent of 
those arrested under TADA have been convicted, society must take 
serious note. TADA has been upheld, but the Court has also put 
the onus on the authorities to enforce it properly. As in other 
parts of the world, the Indian police are not necessarily kind 
and gentle. When the police are also engaged in trading bullets 
with terrorists, the state has an additional problem as to how a 
force armed to the teeth and trained to kill is going to police 
the by-lanes of small-town India? Punjab is currently facing 
this problem. TADA or no TADA, the crux of the matter is to 
control the police. The steps recommended by the Court must, of 
course, be incorporated into the TADA procedure, but at the same 
time the police must be trained, educated, and better led. If 
the police system is brought back into order, then TADA will 
cease to be so controversial.

<F P=106> [Article by Sushma Ramachandran: "Government Wants Crude </F>
Output Stepped Up"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. The Government has directed the 
premier oil exploration and production agencies, the Oil and 
Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the Oil India Limited (OIL) 
to step up output by 15 per cent annually over the next three 
years. This is essential to meet the target of 47.08 million 
tonnes of output by the terminal year of the Eighth Plan. 
  Unless production is raised to these levels, oil imports 
will 
have to be substantially increased to bridge the growing 
demand-supply gap. Official sources say the higher production 
will be required to meet domestic demand even though the 
hydrocarbons sector is facing an acute resource crunch. As much 
as 70 per cent of total Plan outlay has already been utilised, 
with another three years remaining in the Eighth Plan. 
  In view of the constraints on resources, sources point out 
there is no escape from liberalisation and restructuring of the 
hydrocarbons sector in case the country is serious about 
achieving the goal of self-sufficiency in oil production. 
Several measures have already been taken to ensure greater flow 
of resources like inviting foreign oil majors to participate in 
the process of crude exploration and production of proven 
oilfields. But evidently the terms and conditions have not 
proved attractive enough as the response for exploration has not 
been as enthusiastic as desired. On the other hand, 
multinationals are keen to enter into projects for production 
and processing of proven fields where contracts have recently 
been awarded to Reliance Industries in collaboration with Enron 
of the U.S. and Videocon in a tie up with Marubeni of Japan. 
<H5>  Increase in Imports </H5>
  Expressing concern over the low domestic crude output in 
recent years which has already led to an increase in oil 
imports, the Petroleum Ministry notes that production during 
1992-93 was only 26.95 million tonnes. This is 5.3 per cent 
lower than the target and nearly 21 per cent lower than the peak 
of 34.09 million tonnes achieved in 1989-90. Even during the 
current financial year, output is likely to be marginally lower 
than in 1992-93, according to latest reports. 
  The decline in production over the last few years, however, 
was due to unavoidable factors. One of the primary reasons was 
the need to carry out rectification measures in the Bombay High 
offshore fields, the most prolific oil producing area. The 
rectification was necessary since the fields were "flogged" by 
overproduction in the mid-eighties. As a result, the reservoir 
was damaged leading to the present situation where numerous 
wells have had to be closed down for workover operations. 
  Another factor affecting production has been the law and 
order situation in Assam, which has effectively curbed output 
from the northeastern region. 
  Though these are factors beyond the control of the ONGC or 
OIL, there is no getting away from the fact that there has been 
considerable slippage in achieving Plan targets. The Petroleum 
Ministry and Planning Commission are believed to have directed 
the two leading exploration and production agencies to take 
remedial steps quickly to take corrective action so that 
production targets are achieved. 
  The increase in availability will have to be achieved 
despite 
the shortage of resources. Latest official data shows that the 
outlays for the first two years of the Eighth Plan have absorbed 
as much as 70 per cent of the total allocation of Rs. 24,000 
crore for the petroleum sector in the Plan period. 
  The ONGC which has lately been converted into a public 
limited company is already in the process of raising funds by 
disinvesting 20 per cent of its equity. The disinvestment 
programme which is to be completed this year will be partially 
in European capital markets and partly within the country. The 
company is expected to become more effective in its prime role 
of oil exploration in its new restructured incarnation as a 
corporation instead of a commission.

<F P=106> [Article: "Parliament Approves Air Corporation Bill"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Parliament today approved the 
Air Corporations Bill to convert Air India and Indian Airlines 
into public limited companies, with the Rajya Sabha passing the 
measure by 63 to 29 votes in a division amidst a noisy protest 
by the Opposition members. 
  The Opposition members, especially from the left parties, 
took exception to the absence of the Civil Aviation Minister, 
Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was to have replied to the discussion. 
The reply was given by the Surface Transport Minister, Mr. 
Jagdish Tytler. 
  Mr. Gurudas Das Gupta (CPI) (Communist Party of India) and 
Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPI-M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist), who 
raised points of order in this connection, were told by Mr. V. 
Narayanasamy, who was in the Chair, that Mr. Azad had sought 
permission from the chairman, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, for leave of 
absence and for allowing Mr. Tytler to move the Bill on his 
behalf. The permission to both had been granted to him by the 
Chairman, he told the members. 
  The Opposition members insisted that the consideration and 
passage of the Bill be put to division which showed 63 `ayes' 
and 29 `noes.' The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) members did not 
participate in the voting process, though one of them, Mr. 
Maheshwar Singh, moved a resolution disapproving of the 
ordinance promulgated on January 29. 
  Earlier, participating in the discussion, members expressed 
concern at the "unequal competition" between private airlines 
and Air India and Indian Airlines. They also urged the 
Government to take steps to stop serving of liquor by private 
domestic airlines. 
  Some members said the Government was changing its course 
midway without planning and the mixed economy was being given a 
go by in the name of privatisation. -- PTI

<F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 23. With the petroleum companies 
having achieved a significant improvement in performance, 
central public enterprises recorded a 44 per cent increase in 
net profits during 1992-93. The scenario would have been far 
brighter, but for the fact that losses by sick public 
enterprises had mounted to nearly Rs. 4,000 [rupees] crore. 
  This is disclosed in the Public Enterprises Survey for 
1992-93 which was presented in Parliament today. The Indian Oil 
Corporation (IOC) heads the list of profitable undertakings, 
with a net profit of Rs. 935 crores, while Rastriya Ispat Nigam 
is the highest loss-making concern with a net loss of Rs. 568 
crores. 
  The net profit for the year had risen by Rs. 1,040 crores to 
reach Rs. 3,395 crores during the year. The petroleum sector, as 
usual, is responsible for the lion's share with Rs. 551 crores 
but non-oil sector companies also achieved a substantial 
increase in net profit estimated at Rs. 489 crore. 
  The impact of the loss-making enterprises on the overall 
performance of the public sector is indicated by the fact that 
the net profits of 131 enterprises is Rs. 7,346 crores while 104 
companies suffered Rs. 3,950.50 crores. 
  In an analysis of the performance of non-oil companies which 
are not sick, the Survey finds that these have shown net profits 
of Rs. 1,798 crores compared to Rs. 1,574 crores the previous 
year. The study had been carried out to exclude the effect of 
very high profits of the oil enterprises and the large losses of 
sick companies and evaluates performance of other units in a 
competitive environment. It concludes that sick enterprises are 
mainly responsible for low profitability of public enterprises 
as these account for net losses of Rs. 2,524 crores in the 
manufacturing and service sectors. 
  The Survey notes that the overall net return on investment, 
in terms of ratio of net profit to capital employed, had risen 
only marginally from 2 per cent in 1991-92 to 2.43 per cent in 
1992-93. The gross profit, when viewed as percentage of capital 
employed, also shows a marginal decline from 18.83 per cent to 
18.02 per cent. 
  According to the Survey, this has to be viewed in the 
background of the multi-dimensional objectives of public 
enterprises and the divergent constraints faced by them. In 
order to be fair to them, it is felt, it will be necessary to 
take into account the obligations of public enterprises which 
transcend the concepts of production and profits. The 
performance of public enterprises had to be evaluated keeping in 
view the contributions made in discharging socio-economic 
obligations, development of backward regions, provision of 
public utility services and selling basic inputs or products at 
administered prices. 
  The Survey which had taken the performance of 245 
enterprises 
into account, notes that the investment in these companies had 
risen by Rs. 11,526 crores, an increase of 8.5 per cent. 
Similarly, gross sales had recorded an improvement of Rs. 12,807 
crores, a 9.5 per cent rise. Value added in production 
enterprises also rose by 8.24 per cent, from Rs. 35,212 crores 
to Rs. 38,114 crores. 
  Other highlights: Other highlights of the Survey 
are, the 13.67 per cent rise in gross internal resources. These 
have increased by Rs. 1,780.51 crores, to reach Rs. 14,723 
crores from Rs. 12,942 crores last year. Export earnings have 
also risen by Rs. 1,366 crores to touch Rs. 10,345 crores during 
the year. Contribution to the exchequer in the form of corporate 
tax, Excise duty, Customs and other duties and dividend 
increased by Rs. 2,136 crores from Rs. 19,951 crores the 
previous year. 
  The company with the highest investment during the year is 
the National Thermal Power Corporation with a total investment 
of Rs. 17,700 crores followed by Coal India Limited with Rs. 
10,508 crores. 
  In absolute terms, the gross profit of public enterprises 
during the year had risen by Rs. 2,303 crores, a 17 per cent 
increase from Rs. 13,675 crores in 1991-92 to Rs. 15,978 crores. 
  The Survey notes that the ratio of net turnover to capital 
employed brings out the efficiency of utilisation of funds of 
any enterprises. This had fallen to 95.77 per cent in 1992-93, 
compared to 104.78 per cent the previous year. Group-wise 
analysis, however, indicates that there had been an improvement 
in the ratio in eight sectors, including tourist services, 
contracts and construction textiles and consumer goods. Another 
13 sectors had shown a decline, including medium and light 
engineering, petroleum and trading and marketing. 
  Providing an overall picture of profit and loss in various 
industry groups, the Survey notes that the steel sector losses 
had fallen by Rs. 430 crores. On the other hand, losses of the 
fertiliser sector had risen from Rs. 394 crores to Rs. 564 
crores while the textiles industry losses had increased from Rs. 
313 crores to Rs. 572 crores. Profits of the petroleum sector 
had risen by Rs. 551 crores, while other sectors which had 
registered some increase in profits are coal, financial 
services, and telecom. The manufacturing sector as a whole shows 
a rise in a profit of Rs. 530 crores against Rs. 510 crores for 
the services sector. 
  On memoranda of understanding (MOUs), it is stated that 98 
enterprises entered into such agreement with their 
administrative Ministries during the year. Of these, 34 were 
rated as `excellent,' and 35 `very good.' 
  The Survey says that a major initiative to disinvest 
Government shareholding in public sector units was taken during 
the year in order to raise resources, encourage wider public 
participation and promote greater accountability. An amount of 
Rs. 1,912 crores was mobilised during the year by disinvesting 
around five per cent equity holding of 16 public enterprises. In 
the previous year, the Government had disinvested eight per cent 
of the shareholding in 30 enterprises at a total value of Rs. 
3,038 crore. 
  Another significant development during the year was the 
identification of 44 central public enterprises as being sick 
following the amendment to the Sick Industrial Companies 
(Special Provisions) Act 1985. Of these, 40 have been registered.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Difficult Exercise"] </F>
  [Text] The railway budget estimates for 1994-95 had to be 
formulated by the Union Railway Minister, Mr. C.K. Jaffer 
Sharief, against the backdrop of a shortfall in receipts from 
freight and passenger traffic and the consequent reduction in 
internally generated resources. The need to revise downward the 
target for originating freight traffic and the deceleration in 
growth in passenger traffic are due to the slow rise in 
industrial production and resistance from passengers to rising 
fares. From the first time in recent years the budget estimates 
of gross traffic receipts have not been realised and it has been 
necessary to reduce the Plan outlay in 1993-94 by Rs. 300 
[rupees] crores even with the success in raising larger 
resources through tax-free bonds. 
  Since the law of diminishing returns would seem to be 
operating with successive increases in freight rates and 
passenger fares and the gross domestic product has not been 
rising as expected, Mr. Jaffer Sharief had to take note of the 
warning signals and adopt a cautious approach when finalising 
proposals for upward adjustments in freight rates and passenger 
fares. Even otherwise it was generally expected that there would 
have to be increases under these heads as diesel oil has become 
costlier and other inputs have become dearer for various 
reasons. In spite of the escalation in cost, it is claimed that 
economies in working expenses to the extent of Rs.200 crores 
have been achieved and with reduction in appropriation to 
depreciation fund and other adjustments, the revised estimates 
disclose a surplus of 973 crores against Rs. 2,195 crores 
(budget). 
  The target for originating freight traffic however has been 
raised for 1994-95 though the growth in passenger traffic has 
been estimated at only two per cent. [Passage illegible] the 
increase in freight traffic can materialise only it there is no 
repetition of the experience of 1993-94. Much depends of course 
on the developments in the economy in 1994-95. On the basis of 
the estimates, it is expected that there will be a shortfall in 
resources of Rs. 997 crores for financing even a modest Plan 
outlay of Rs. 6,515 crores. This is only marginally higher than 
the budget estimates for 1993-94. A larger portion will be found 
through borrowing and a higher level of budgetary support 
because of inadequate generation of internal resources. The Plan 
outlay should be much higher than it is now though paucity of 
resources is a limiting factor. It is also intended to 
streamline operations with a restructuring of zonal systems and 
a better use of the capacity of Railway enterprises. 
  Even though a valiant attempt has been made to limit 
escalation in costs and use available resources optimally, it 
has been necessary again to raise freight rates and passenger 
fares. A new procedure has been adopted for pushing up freight 
rates with changes in classification. It would appear that the 
incidence of upward adjustments will be more severe in respect 
of commodities whose handling has not been remunerative enough 
for the Railways. The increase in the cost of moving bulk 
commodities over longer distances may thus be more pronounced 
than in the case of high rated traffic. While passenger fares 
have been raised by six per cent, an effort has been made to 
reduce cosmetically fares for short distances. In the event, the 
hike in freight rates will fetch additionally Rs. 800 crores and 
passenger fares Rs. 197 crores. The total amount sought to be 
raised was as much as Rs. 1,848 crores last year. Railway users 
may thus feel that they have been let off relatively lightly 
though the cumulative effect of the changes in recent years is 
proving to be regressive. In the changing situation a 
strengthening of the Railway finances can be ensured only with a 
growth in all types of traffic.

  [Text] Consumption of natural gas in Iran has increased 
from 11.4 billion cubic meters [bm[.sup]3[/]] in 1989 to 28.9 
bm[.sup]3[/] by the end of 1994. 
  This was reported by the director of National Iranian Gas 
Company, Asadollah Salihi Faruz, in an interview with 
journalists. He said that the increased consumption of natural 
gas during the planning years [1990-94] clearly shows that gas 
as a replacement for half-distilled imported products has led to 
a saving of $16 billion. 
  He added that for the first time during the last few days 
natural gas production has gone up to 111.2 million cubic meters 
[m[.sup]3[/]] a day, which is the current level of gas 
consumption in the country. 
  The director of National Iranian Gas Company added that the 
National Iranian Gas Company general assembly in a meeting, 
attended by the president and six members of the Cabinet, 
approved that priority in gas consumption should be given to 
domestic use--not to export. 
  Concerning gas pipelines, he said that the total length of 
pipelines built by the end of 1989 was 5,000 km, which will 
reach 8,100 km by the end of 1994. In other words, there was 
more than 62-percent growth of gas pipeline construction during 
the First Five-Year Plan. 
  About extending pipelines to cities in the country, Mr. 
Salihi Faruz said that building networks and installing service 
lines reached 15,660 km and 758,000 extension lines by the end 
of 1989. By the end of the plan, there will be 33,834 km 
networks and 1,880 extension lines. In this way, the length of 
laying networks during the five-year plan will be 18,156 km and 
the number of installed extensions will be 1,122, which means 
that there has been an average 17-percent growth per year in 
building networks and 20 percent growth in installing extension 
lines. 
  Concerning export of gas to other countries, he said that 
with the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the cut-off of 
gas to that country, a similar contract was signed with 
Azerbaijan, on the basis of which 8 m[.sup]3[/] of gas per 
day was exported to Azerbaijan for a year. Because of 
Azerbaijan's financial problems, there has not been any export 
of gas to that country since last winter. 
  Mr. Salihi Faruz said that the joint partnership of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and France in the area of underwater 
and overland production, in constructing pipelines, in planning 
and building stations to increase pressure in the Sarakhs-Naka 
gas-line, and in expansing the gas industry are among the 
accomplishments of the National Iranian Gas Company. He added 
that National Iranian Gas Company in partnership with Gas-tu 
France signed a contract with a 50-percent share of $200,000, 
which is currently in operation. 
  According to Mr. Salihi, for the purpose of exporting gas to 
Europe, Iran and France together, with a 60-percent joint share, 
are cooperating with five European countries: Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Germany, Austria, and Spain, with a total 40-percent 
share, each with a share of 8 percent. 
  At the end, he mentioned the problem of cash (the decline of 
gas prices), delay in opening credits, demands for funds for 
drilling permit and asphalt, prevention of the company works by 
municipalities and by some institutions, problems of acquiring 
land for extending pipelines, and shortage of contractors--he 
considered these to be among the executive problems of the 
company. He mentioned that if a portion of the remark under 
Article 25 of 1994 budget is to be left out, the National 
Iranian Gas Company will be forced to cease operating.

  [Text] According to figures reported by the Center for the 
Expansion of Exports, during the eight months of the current 
year, 1,301 tons of onions, with a value of 4 million rials [R], 
have been exported. 
  In other words, we have sold a kilo of onions for R3, which 
means that our total profit from the sale of onions has been 
only $200, with R2,000 being equivalent to 1 dollar. Is it worth 
getting engaged in such exports only to ruin our domestic onions 
market? 
  Have we not ruined the export culture by such exports? 
  Not to mention the losses suffered by the poor 
exporters--while the price of onions in domestic markets was 10 
times--no, 100 times--more than what it was sold for abroad. 
  Then, let us not plead the cause of farmers when middlemen 
run away with the wind-blown profit and when officials are 
blamed for the bad onion markets here and abroad. 
  Finally, the clamor of publicity on importing onions lost 
its 
momentum. However, a kilo of onions went up to R1,000. 
  God willing, the concerned officials, particularly those of 
the Ministry of Agriculture, may have learned some lesson from 
all this.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Sinyurah by Lisa Frydman; place and </F>
date not given; first paragraph is JERUSALEM POST comment] 
  [Text] Publisher, activist and banker, east Jerusalemite 
Hanna Sinyurah shares his views on the aftermath of Hebron, 
prospect for economic success in the territories, and putting 
Jerusalem on the peace agenda. 
  In the wake of the Hebron massacre and threats of 
Palestinian 
retaliation, it was nerve-racking meeting Hanna Sinyurah at his 
office on Nabulus Road. 
  Sinyurah, who was heading for Tunis, said politely that our 
meeting would either take place at his office or no interview. 
Not only was he short of time, but he was short of patience for 
the "psychological war of fear" which separates east and west 
Jerusalem. 
  Walking up two flights of stairs in the old, decrepit office 
building, I found Sinyurah seated behind a desk flooded with 
paperwork. Wearing a crewneck sweater and a trendy sports 
jacket, Sinyurah looked out of place in his more conservative 
surroundings. His manner was cool, reserved and all business; 
time was of the essence. 
  Our meeting came at the end of a particularly hectic month. 
Named the chairman of the new International Palestine Bank, 
scheduled to open as soon as it received approval from the Bank 
of Israel and the PLO, Sinyurah had been traveling constantly 
between Madrid, Tunis and Israel. The bank is being established 
by Sinyurah and a prominent group of Palestinians, together with 
Bank Leumi, the Commercial Bank of Morocco and Spain's Banco 
Central Hispano. The consortium hopes to establish branches 
throughout the territories and will be involved in all banking 
ventures, including local and international investments, 
transactions and project development. Sinyurah, however, says 
all economic plans will remain frozen until problems in the 
political sphere are resolved. 
  Sinyurah, a pharmacist and the former editor of the 
now-defunct AL-FAJR daily, just launched the new 
English-language Palestinian weekly, THE JERUSALEM TIMES. Unlike 
AL-FAJR, a known mouthpiece for the PLO, Sinyurah says he's 
trying to insure the TIMES remains independent of the 
powers-that-be and to turn it into a commercially viable entity; 
his focus is on ad revenues rather than big-name benefactors to 
keep it afloat. 
  Sinyurah also serves as chairman of the European-Palestinian 
Chamber of Commerce and is a member of the board of trustees of 
the Workers' Education Association. Considered a prominent 
member of east Jerusalem's intelligentsia, Sinyurah boasts 
friends and contacts on both sides of the Green Line. An idea 
man bubbling with blueprints for economic prosperity in the 
territories. Sinyurah has nonetheless been forced to succumb to 
the tortoise-like movement of the peace negotiators: No peace, 
no bank. 
  [Frydman] How is the delay in the peace negotiations 
affecting the development of the Palestine Bank? 
  [Sinyurah] We are waiting for approval by the Bank of 
Israel. 
But the progress of the bank runs at the same rate as the peace 
process. Right now, everything is on hold. 
  [Frydman] How did the Palestine Bank develop&gt; 
  [Sinyurah] It grew out of discussions between the 
Palestinians and Bank Leumi, which resulted in an agreement for 
the International Palestine Bank to buy branches of Bank Leumi 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This grew into a four-way 
partnership, which will operate all types of banking activities, 
with emphasis on international trade relations, investments and 
transfers of money in and out of the area. 
  [Frydman] Jordan is also establishing a network of 
banks in the territories. Is this healthy competition, or a 
threat? 
  [Sinyurah] Look, the Palestinian authorities have adopted a 
market economy, so we are encouraging investment. All the 
partners are our neighbors. We want our people, who have 
suffered the most, to develop the economy, but we certainly 
understand that we cannot do it alone and need international 
assistance. There is a signed agreement between the PLO and 
Jordan on economic cooperation. There is a similar signed 
agreement with the Egyptians. We are also working on such an 
agreement with the Israeli side. 
  [Frydman] According to Bank Leumi, the bank's initial 
capital is slated to be about $40 million. Is this enough for a 
smooth beginning? 
  [Sinyurah] You can actually start a bank according to 
regulations with $10 million. So, when you begin with $40 
million it's a good start. At the same time, we will be growing. 
We have already been contacted by American and German interests. 
  [Frydman] Is the bank planning any specific investments 
in Jerusalem? 
  [Sinyurah] Unfortunately, the status of Jerusalem will be 
held off to second-stage negotiations at the peace talks. And 
that must change, because really this principle issue cannot be 
postponed. However, as far as Jerusalem goes, at the moment we 
have no intention of opening a branch of the bank. But the four 
partners will have interest in a Dutch holding company, which 
will have offices in Jerusalem. 
  [Frydman] What are the bank's goals and priorities in 
Jerusalem? 
  [Sinyurah] In the future, as a bank we are looking forward 
to 
investing in the infrastructure of the Palestinian economy. As a 
Palestinian, I am concerned that the life of east Jerusalemites 
will be improved. There are shortages of housing for 
Palestinians. There's a big gap in infrastructure as compared to 
that of west Jerusalem. And we feel that not only our bank but 
also other interests should invest in the development of the 
infrastructure of east Jerusalem so that it can one day be 
comparable to the west side's economy. 
  [Frydman] What's your opinion of the Olmert 
administration as compared to the Kollek administration so 
far? 
  [Sinyurah] Well, I know both Kollek and Olmert personally. 
Yet, at the same time, I feel that today Olmert is at the mercy 
of the ultra-religious community. Jerusalem has always been a 
right-wing city and I think he will lead the way for more 
tension to develop. I'm watching Olmert on issues such as 
housing, upgrading services, etc. I'm not going to prejudge 
Olmert, but we have not seen much of anything yet. 
  [Frydman] Hindsight is 20/20. Had the residents of east 
Jerusalem come out to vote in the mayoral election, do you think 
the Palestinians would have more of a voice in City Hall? Was it 
a mistake? 
  [Sinyurah] I have been involved in politics for a long time 
and I feel that at least under the present situation 
Palestinians have been denied civil rights. Palestinians did not 
come out to vote because it would have meant legitimizing the 
present state of affairs. 
  [Frydman] Yet how else can you change the status 
quo? 
  [Sinyurah] I also believe that we can emphasize our rights 
by 
establishing Palestinian prosperity and I feel that if there is 
Palestinian prosperity in east Jerusalem along with Israeli 
prosperity in west Jerusalem that can also build bridges of 
cooperation. I still believe in cooperation between both sides 
of Jerusalem, but only on an equality basis and this doesn't 
seem to be the case right now. 
  [Frydman] What is your vision for the future of 
Jerusalem--a divided city? A unified municipality? 
  [Sinyurah] An undivided city, but with two sovereignties in 
cooperation with each other. This city has its history, its two 
peoples. If we want to have peace we must consider this, but 
that does not mean that we cannot have peace, if people are 
sincere and understanding. Right now, there are a lot of 
Palestinians who are deprived of their rights. 
  [Frydman] You wear many hats. How do you plan to juggle 
serving as head of the Palestinian Bank with publishing a brand 
new newspaper and ensuring its financial success? 
  [Sinyurah] First of all, I come from the media. I have been 
working in this line of work for the past 20 years. I was out of 
it for a very brief period of five months and I could not stand 
it, which is why I came back into the business working for THE 
JERUSALEM TIMES. This won't take up so much of my time because I 
am no longer working as editor-in-chief but serve as its 
publisher. 
  As far as AL-FAJR, I can tell you that the English edition 
of 
that paper never lost money. It was the financial troubles of 
the Arabic edition that led to the demise of both the English 
and Arabic papers. I also plan to enter into local radio as soon 
as possible. 
  [Frydman] Let's get into the logistics of the new 
newspaper. Who's your target market--what's your strategy? 
  [Sinyurah] Right now we are printing 5,000 copies weekly. We 
are trying to regain AL-FAJR's lost readers from the United 
States. Our goal is to increase our circulation to 10,000 
copies. At present we have a local audience of one thousand 
Palestinians, but our target audience is Israelis and here I am 
still having a lot of problems in that market. I have about two 
hundred regulars, but I want to broaden this number to about 
three thousand. That's why I am adding a new dimension to the 
JERUSALEM TIMES, which will focus on the business/economic 
aspects of Israel, in which many Israelis are interested. This 
will provide Israeli businessmen with information about how the 
Palestinian economy is developing. 
  We have an excellent market in major cities in the United 
States, which includes Middle East experts, university faculty, 
students, etc. AL-FAJR also used to have quite a few 
American-Jewish readers--our next target market. We would also 
like to expand the TIMES to goverment readers as well. 
  [Frydman] Can the TIMES realistically stay a commercial 
paper with an even-handed viewpoint, or will it inevitably 
become politically biased like AL-FAJR? 
  [Sinyurah] Well, there will be a political section in the 
paper. But again, my concentration will be developing the 
economic section. There will also be a cultural section to 
demonstrate the mosaic of Palestinian cultural life and people, 
and a religious section. 
  [Frydman] Do you plan to open your paper to opposing 
viewpoints? Will Israeli writers find room on your op-ed 
page? 
  [Sinyurah] We have already contributions from Israelis, a 
British-Jewish expert on Jerusalem, etc., so yes, our paper is 
open to anyone who has something to say regardless of opinion, 
but in a way that will build the bridges of understanding of our 
two peoples. At the same time, my newspaper is open to all 
perspectives in the Palestinian camp. 
  [Frydman] What was the feeling in your community about 
the immediate condemnation of the Hebron massacre by Prime 
Minister Rabin, Rabbi Lau, Mayor Olmert, and the majority of the 
population? 
  [Sinyurah] I can tell you that although they had expressed 
their outrage, Palestinians worry about how we are going to 
protect ourselves. 
  [Frydman] Many Israelis perceive a double-standard 
here, because when terrorists strike Israelis, it seems that 
groups jockey to claim responsibility, and condemnation doesn't 
occur unless there's international pressure. 
  [Sinyurah] That's not true. I think actions against humanity 
are not accepted by the Palestinians in general. And many 
Palestinian leaders--'Arafat and others--have condemned terror. 
  [Frydman] What's your feeling about the Western Wall 
plaza being closed by police authorities for fear of 
violence? 
  [Sinyurah] I think the Israeli authorities were being wise 
in 
wanting to avoid clashes. All the holy sites should be 
protected. Unfortunately, despite security measures we had the 
massacre in Hebron, so clearly the protection is not adequate. 
But the steps taken were appropriate. 
  [Frydman] In light of the massacre and the fanatics on 
both sides of the fence, is peace a reality or are we all 
deluding ourselves? 
  [Sinyurah] Look, we have no other alternative. If we allow 
the extremists to win then we have no future. The only way to 
fight back is to cooperate. We must stress education. We have to 
change the stereotypes. It's a long process. We are changing 
from a mentality of war to a new mentality of working together. 
It won't happen overnight. It's going to take 10, 15, 20 years. 
  [Frydman] What is your next venture? 
  [Sinyurah] To work at peace. I would like to remain in 
politics, but only in the background. My real goal is to do 
everything possible to improve the economic status and push 
forward initiatives in the area--which would stabilize the 
forces. We can have all the agreements in the world, but real 
peace will only come with economic prosperity in the occupied 
territories.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Samir 'Abdallah] </F>
  [Text] The economic topics brought up in the negotiations 
are no less important than defining the features of the future 
and defining the larger goals we seek vis-a-vis the topics set 
out in the negotiations, which will be the foundation upon which 
a Palestinian development strategy must be based. First: the 
volume of sources which will be available, at the disposal of 
Palestinian citizens and authorities. 
  Unfortunately, although Palestinian rights and demands are 
clear, it is not clear what natural and economic sources will be 
granted to Palestinians and the Palestinian authorities. Here we 
are speaking principally, or most importantly, about land, 
water, and about tourist resources, specifically Jerusalem. 
Additionally, we may be in a position to exploit the fishery 
resources in Gaza and the Jericho area. The other part, 
regarding resources, is decision-making power in the management 
and independence of these sources, which is another very 
important topic in these negotiations. 
  The other important matter is the nature of relations with 
Israel. It is a known fact that over the past 27 years of 
occupation, interlocking economic relations were imposed 
unilaterally. These relations were characterized by hegemony and 
inequality; will the negotiations bring about a reformulation of 
these relations on new bases of equality, mutual benefit, and 
the right of reciprocity? This is a very important issue, and 
may be even more crucial than the time factor, given the 
vagueness that surrounds these elements. Perhaps if we wish to 
adopt a development strategy, we may be compelled to get into 
strategic scenarios and not into defining strategies. 
  In addition to these factors, which, as I said, will be 
settled by the negotiations, there are some factors or 
relatively stable, or more stable characteristics, and some 
utterly unstable ones, but because they are linked to some 
extent with some objective factors, these factors, too, 
influence or form, with other factors, the framework in which 
this strategy will be built. These elements are: 
  First: Limited Natural Resources 
  It is well known that, even should we obtain all independent 
Palestine's sources and resources (God willing), we must look to 
a development strategy. This is because in general it does not 
possess natural resources and raw materials sufficient to supply 
local industry and local agriculture with input. This means an 
inability to obtain foreign parts and foreign currency by 
exporting resources. There will be a significant dependence on 
commercial markets to supply our productive sectors with input. 
This is very important, and sheds light on the importance of 
foreign trade and our freedom to gain access to other markets. 

    Second: The Small Local Market 
  Palestine's market is known to be very small, and this in 
turn means that the expansion of production or of commodity 
production basically rests on our ability to gain access to new 
markets abroad. This is another example of the elements defining 
our development strategy; that is, the growth of the Palestinian 
economy will depend to a large extent on our ability to market 
our products in foreign markets. If they are closed, or if we do 
not succeed in that, there will be severe limits on the growth 
of our commodity markets. 
  Third: Structure of the Economy 
  There is no easy way out of this. The general structure of 
the economy is known to depend greatly on agriculture, which 
comprises 25-30 percent of the economy; on local products and 
weak industry, which represent no more than 10 percent; and the 
building and construction sector, which represents 15 percent. 
The rest is mostly domestic services and other services. If we 
go into the makeup or structure of the sectors in depth, we note 
that they were formed under the influence of many factors; 
chiefly, and most ominously, perhaps, is that the structure of 
our industries was formed by Israeli demand. This is highly 
significant when we look at our strategic options in the nature 
of the relations we want to establish and create with 
neighboring countries. 
  Fourth: The Palestinian Economy's Level of 
Development 
  There is no escaping from this when the development strategy 
is released. And so this means that our ambitions, in order to 
be realistic, must be linked to our level of development. We 
cannot say, "Our strategy must include..." and then add, for 
example, possibly complex and intense industries, such as are 
sometimes considered. At our level of development, we must look 
at the most important elements, and the most important elements 
or components at the level of development. 
  Our economy suffers from very severe infrastructural 
backwardness in all areas. I would here like to point out that 
over the past 27 years the Israelis have spent no more than $15 
per Palestinian on infrastructure, while spending per Israeli on 
infrastructure was $1,000 per year. In Jordan, the figure is 
more than $100, at various times; even in the current period of 
crisis, with the dinar crisis and the economic crisis in Jordan, 
this spending has not fallen below $100 per person; it remains, 
practically, seven times what is spent here. According to World 
Bank experts' very conservative estimates (with which we do not 
agree), the Palestinian people have the infrastructure necessary 
for its economic level. I believe we have one third of the 
infrastructure needed for a balanced economy; the importance of 
the material and social parts of an infrastructure is well 
known. 
  The second issue that characterizes our backward economy is 
the lack of and severe weakness in institutions, specifically 
the economic institutions that will be responsible for managing 
the funding process. It is well known that most of these are 
locally run institutions; we all know how marginal and weak the 
municipalities' role is. In practical terms, we need a major 
strengthening process in order for them to play a significant 
role in the development process regarding the official authority 
or institutions of civil administration that the Palestinian 
authority will appoint. We may say that qualified people capable 
of playing a leading role in the development process in the 
future are few and far between. In spite of all the factors that 
represent a framework in the development process or adoption of 
a strategy, one must note some of the positive elements that 
should be taken into consideration when we formulate a 
development strategy. They are: 
  The first element: the relatively excellent level of human 
resources provided or available to the Palestinian economy. When 
I speak of human resources, we must not forget that it is 
possible to multiply their capabilities if we can attract 
qualified Palestinian people from abroad. This is highly 
significant, and I hope the coming Palestinian authority will 
offer incentives to qualified Palestinians abroad to come here 
and work on developing their economies. 
  The second element: in our economy, also, we have a relative 
distinction in the agricultural sector, and this relative 
distinction has limits, as a matter of course. I may say, 
however, that it will play a basic role when it comes to new 
funding for the other sectors, the relative distinction we have 
in terms of work productivity and reliable technical ability. 
This could be of primary benefit during the transitional period, 
in order to form a basic tributary of development. 
  The third element, also important and positive, and to which 
attention must be given, is tourism potential, or the power of 
the Palestinian economy to turn tourism into a key element and 
primary funded sector of the Palestinian economy. But this 
requires great attention in this sector, and an infrastructure. 
It could be taxable in the early phases, and as a matter of 
course I do not expect the Palestinian authority to be capable 
of adopting sufficient funding for this sector, but it can 
create an appropriate framework and sufficient incentives for 
the Palestinian, Arab, and foreign private sectors. 
  The fourth element, important, though perhaps not of great 
importance, but necessary to take into consideration: our 
economy, which has faced major confiscation by the Israelis. The 
Palestinian economy has been a commercial free zone for the 
Israelis; this in itself powered our industries, in some form or 
another, industries that were faced with very intense 
competition, and that were able to survive and evolve in highly 
competitive circumstances. They compelled them to increase 
productivity and improve quality, in order to open horizons, as 
there would be competitive industries abroad, especially in Arab 
markets. These are the components of the general framework on 
which the strategy is built, but where is the centerpiece of 
these components? This is the real question. I believe--and I 
may be wrong--that the nature of the commercial system upon 
which we are agreeing with the Israelis--as is known from the 
negotiations--is based on two contradictory positions. 
<H5>  The Israeli Position </H5>
  It desires and seeks to consolidate the status quo, with 
some 
minor improvements, in the sense of maintaining the customs 
union as a limited framework for the commercial system, a system 
of exchange between Israel and Palestine. This means that the 
Palestinian market, and the Palestinians, will not be able to 
achieve the freedom of foreign markets, but that they would have 
the freedom to formulate their foreign trade policy. This 
framework might allow Palestine to benefit from the agreements 
Israel has concluded with the Common Market and the United 
States. It will be easy for Palestinians to get concessions from 
these groups, but it will completely deprive the Palestinians of 
the fabric of independent economic relations in some markets, 
including the Arab markets. This is, in my view, a very great 
problem, because the markets--and I have spoken of the factors 
that make foreign trade for Palestine very important, with a 
very great role in economic growth--our markets are not the EEC, 
or America. If we were to succeed in this phase (the development 
phase) in finding markets abroad, these markets would be Eastern 
Europe, the former Soviet Union, Africa, and the Arab countries. 
These are the markets in which we can find wide areas for 
marketing our agricultural and industrial surpluses. At the same 
time, we can get raw materials and industrial input from these 
groups more cheaply, meaning lower production costs. Thus it is 
possible, if we are deprived of this framework, for us to have 
very great development problems. In return, we Palestinians ask 
for the customs union to be replaced by a free trade agreement 
and a trade accord that would mean our continued benefit from 
the Israeli market. 
  We depend on the Israeli market for our imports and exports. 
The Israeli market is the primary market now, and we cannot do 
without it. A trade accord would allow us access to the Israeli 
market as before, but as a matter of course there will be 
barriers to re-exporting some of the products we import, and we 
can re-export them according to the free trade agreement. This 
is the key point that would enable us to have an independent 
economic policy suited to the needs of our economy and 
developmental level; at the same time it would enable us to 
benefit from our existing relations with the Israeli market. 
With this definition of the strategy in the transitional phase, 
my view is that our strategy in the transitional period perhaps 
must focus on primary elements: The first and most important 
element, in my estimation, despite the fact that the necessary 
investments for it are less, is the building of institutions and 
the creation of an administrative and organizational structure 
for the development process. Without it, I believe, it would be 
difficult to rely on the present structure: the civil 
administration framework is fragile and incapable of handling 
the development process. At the same time, the local rule 
framework and the municipalities too require a great deal of 
effort in order to be able to play a primary role. 
  The second element, which might be less costly, but of 
greater importance, is the creation of an appropriate legal 
climate for the launching of the development process. Here the 
issue of military orders and their replacement with contemporary 
laws provides an appropriate framework for private sector 
activity and the use of foreign investments, which is a side 
issue. 
  The third element is a basic one in the field of 
development: 
the rebuilding of the infrastructure. All interest is now 
focused on the infrastructure, without which appropriate 
services cannot be provided to the people and citizens; at the 
same time, investment cannot be facilitated, so this is a key 
issue. 
  The fourth element in our developemnt strategy is education 
reform. Education reform begins with basic education, and 
education reform is a key issue, and possibly merits a 
conference to itself. 
  The fifth element in the features of the strategy is to 
accelerate the developemnt of the banking system. Without a 
banking system, one which provides investors access to 
facilities, it will be difficult to achieve development. Here I 
hope I have succeeded in setting out the features of a strategy. 
I say, and emphasize, that the strategy must be based, and 
generally is based, on specific political goals. The political 
goals thus far are clear, and yet they are not sufficient. Our 
political goal is to establish an independent Palestinian state, 
and bring back the refugees. This goal in itself does not give 
or contain information sufficient for the adoption of a 
development strategy. We are familiar with and have begun to 
introduce the transitional period we speak of. Also, in a 
general way, we have said it is a step on the road to an 
independent Palestinian state. From another aspect, at various 
levels, the phase, as it is structured, lacks clear details upon 
which one might base the adoption of a sound and appropriate 
development strategy.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasmine Jellal: "Could There Be Hope?"] </F>
  [Text] Hopes and expectations inspired by the national 
conference, the dialogue, and the naming of Zeroual continue to 
get wide press coverage. The FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] is 
getting more coverage than ever in the columns of the 
Arab-language weeklies. Except for an interview with Tourabi, it 
was the lead topic this week. 
<H5>  RISSALAT EL-ATLAS (No. 46) </H5>
  This weekly marks the ascension of Liamine Zeroual with an 
article entitled: "How Far Will Algeria's Sixth President Go in 
Implementing His Ideas?" The weekly asks, "Will he be able to 
steer the ship of state to a safe port through this violent 
tempest? And will Algerians who were holding their breath after 
the conference finally be able to breathe again?" 
  The weekly's editorial page focuses on the national 
conference. "Under the headline: `President...and Hostage,' the 
editorialist writes that what happened at the conference "was as 
terrifying as expected." 
  "The national conference failed. What was most distressing 
about the meeting is the fact that the de facto authorities made 
it a forum for reiterating their determination to pursue 
exclusion, eradication, and defiance of the will of the people. 
This is apparent," the editorialist continues, "in the inflamed 
speeches of Ali Kafi and Salim Saadi, in the maintenance by the 
HCE [Higher State Council] of its unconstitutional prerogatives, 
and in the platform of the CDN [Natioanal Dialogue Commission], 
which was tailored to the advantage of the government by 
allowing it to continue to control everything, from the 
`president of the republic' to the planned `transition council' 
and all other institutions, constitutional or otherwise." 
  The weekly also points to an even more serious insult to the 
feelings of the nation, "namely the meeting held between what 
was called civilian society and the so-called helpful sectors of 
society, the majority of which were associations, coalitions, 
and committees. Among the latter was the Committee To Safeguard 
Algeria, which ever since its creation has been responsible, as 
we know, for so many wrongs and injuries in its efforts to 
destroy democracy, elections, and the people's right to choose." 
  Very pessimistically, the weekly opines that, "this is the 
road back to where we started, using the same methods and 
following in the steps of the former transition phase, filled 
with so many tragedies and painful events." "For a glimmer of 
hope to persist and grow stronger, Mr. Liamine Zeroual should 
not have been named to the presidency on the basis of the 
conditions set by the HCE and rejected by Bouteflika, because 
these conditions make the position strictly honorary. And also 
for hope to persist one could wish that it had not been 
Benhamouda and Benmansour proposing Zeroual's candidacy, as the 
French-language press reported. Because that would mean that the 
president would be, just like his predecessors, a hostage of the 
mafia and the ghosts that have ruled Algeria up to now," 
concludes RISSALAT EL-ATLAS. The weekly devotes another article, 
equally acerbic, to the same question. For example: "While those 
who spoke at the national conference regretted the loss of the 
chance for harmony and condemned the boycott of the major 
parties, those words were only for `popular' consumption, 
because what really happened at Club des Pins is what the regime 
had planned and wanted to make happen. 
  "The regime does not want consensus, for it knows that would 
work against it. The El-Khatib commission played precisely the 
role that had been scripted for it." RISSALAT EL-ATLAS also 
published an interview with Hassan Tourabi, reprinted from 
EVENEMENT DU JEUDI and translated into Arabic. In the interview 
Tourabi says, regarding the assassination of Algerian 
intellectuals and foreigners living in Algeria, that "everything 
depends on what name we give the battle..." 
  "In Western philosophy, it is considered legal to resist 
repression and oppression, and this is called `resistance' or 
`revolution'; and in any case all revolutions have their 
victims, and the Algerians are of a revolutionary nature. 
Remember the price they paid to drive out the French: more than 
a million martyrs," said Tourabi. 
<H5>  EL-HADETH (No. 8) </H5>
  In an article entitled: "The FIS and the Regime: Movement 
Toward The Negotiating Table?" this weekly raises the question: 
"What happened behind the scenes that led Anwar Haddam to 
publish his famous communique from Washington?" In answer to 
this question, the weekly notes that: "analysts are divided into 
two camps: One group believes the statement was simply a ploy 
imposed by FIS overseas representatives in order to diffuse 
pressures that Western circles were bringing to bear on FIS 
political figures due to the intensification of activities by 
armed Islamic groups. Other analysts," EL-HADETH continues, 
"have seen behind the declaration an indicator pointing to real 
detente, at least between the political wing of FIS and the 
regime." Between these two contradictory theories, EL-HADETH 
claims to describe what really happened behind the scenes. 
"According to a very well-informed source, the naming of Liamine 
Zeroual was a bid to put an end to the policy pursued by the 
previous group since the advent of Boudiaf, a policy that 
consisted of not entering into serious dialogue with the radical 
Islamist opposition, banking instead, first of all, on the 
weight of the security apparatus and second on moral and 
material support from certain Western circles." The weekly 
continues: "But that gamble, based mainly on a security 
solution, has failed, and its repercussions at the social and 
political levels were not just serious--they were catastrophic." 
"It seems that the military institution, which has been 
implicated on more than one occasion since the events of October 
1988, no longer trusts the civilians, who once in power find 
themselves locked into narrow calculations, the strategy of 
`wait-and-see,' and vacillation, instead of making hard 
decisions," opines EL-HADETH; it cites the example of "the 
previous team, which on the one hand announced its intention of 
having a dialogue with the opposition but as soon as it started 
to become a reality backpedaled from its declared position and 
returned to its original stance, a move that obviously 
exacerbated the political crisis and showed the opposition that 
the government team had no serious intention of resolving the 
crisis." EL-HADETH then quoted again from the above-mentioned 
source to the effect that: "the previous government team labored 
under many inhibitions, which turned into deep-seated anxieties 
having to do with lack of faith in itself, doubts about its own 
legality, and the fact it was running short of time... All these 
misgivings engendered a feeling of frustration within the 
regime, especially when it fell hostage to groups that were 
beating the drums for the eradicationist line, albeit not 
working as political groups to implement that line..." 
  "The regime found itself cut off from both camps--from the 
majority of the people as well as from the opposition," 
EL-HADETH concludes. 
<H5>  EL-WAJH EL-AKHAR (No. 42) </H5>
  The weekly opines that our military leaders: "have been 
fomenting one coup after another, of every conceivable variety. 
There has been a tank behind every president ever installed as 
head of state, and behind every president who resigned. Only the 
military's votes count, when the issue is what constitutes 
electoral legality or revolutionary or historical legitimacy. By 
now, many people have seen through the `trick': The position of 
the presidency in Algeria depends on meeting two basic 
conditions: One must either have revolutionary or historical 
legitimacy recognized by the military, or one must be a general 
oneself," the weekly concludes. 
  On the last page is an article entitled: "Military 
Government, Pending the Advent of `Madani' Government" (author's 
play on words: "madani" means "civilian" in Arabic), in which 
the author says that: "we do not really see any harm in the 
military institution taking power. It is the only institution 
still standing in our country... Throughout history, as El 
Hachemi Cherif said, democratic revolutions have come to power 
by force, not the ballot box; in the past, the army used to say 
it kept its distance from politics and was not interested in 
political power." 
  Later on in the same article, EL-WAJH EL-AKHAR discusses 
what 
it calls: "the shepherds of civilian society and village 
political life." "When S. Sadi pays tribute to the military 
regime for averting a "madani" regime (author's play on words), 
and when Benhamouda marches alone to Club des Pins to demand 
Zeroual's presidency, we can guess how the village `brains' in 
civilian society are going to practice politics: with drum and 
flute." 
  "We, the young," the weekly continues further down, 
"remember 
very clearly the oath taken by Kafi to bring to power young 
technocrats who favor modernity and new ideas...but the reality 
is quite different." 
<H5>  ESSABIL (No. 39) </H5>
  This weekly gives its lead story the headline: "Was the 
Dialogue a Failure?" Yes, it answers: "If we judge the dialogue 
on the basis of the results announced, the judgment must be 
negative...and one can say that it failed...because neither of 
the major interlocutors claimed it was a success, nor did the 
public buy its `artificial' conclusion...even though its 
architects called it an extraordinary achievement. And if we 
gave an interpretation from the point of view of the method by 
which it was organized, we would say it was a coup d'etat 
against the most basic and elementary underlying principles of 
dialogue." 
  On a more optimistic note, the weekly concludes: "While the 
dialogue was not everything the big parties and everyone else 
concerned with saving Algeria wanted it to be, does that mean 
that those who opted for this form of communication were 
deceiving themselves? This new failure of dialogue does not mean 
dialogue is doomed to fail every time, and the heads of the most 
important parties have said the boycott of the national 
conference does not mean a boycott of dialogue per se."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Lambese Prison Breakout: The </F>
Director Had Sounded the Alarm"--first paragraph is LIBERTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] One day will we know the entire truth about the 
Tazoult breakout? Is it a breakout that is still far from 
yielding its secrets and in particular its political 
consequences? 
  In any event, it would seem that this spectacular breakout 
could have been avoided. Indeed, the prison's director, 
according to certain sources, was reported to have sent several 
reports to the authorities concerned to draw their attention to 
indications his jail would soon be attacked. 
  He is reported to have expressed his suspicions to several 
guards. What conclusion should be drawn from this information 
when it is known that the director of the Chlef prison had sent 
a similar report and expressed the same fears? 
  Unlike Tazoult, measures were taken and the prisoners were 
quickly transferred from Chlef to Berrouaghia. It is clear that 
the work of the investigative commission looking into the 
Lambese case will absolutely have to elucidate this question. It 
will also need to provide some answers about the unbelievable 
freedom of movement that the attackers enjoyed. The latter, 
according to the same sources, were reported to have lists of 
all the prisoners "to be freed," with their names, their home 
region, and where they were supposed to go. 
  The possibility cannot be ignored, in this respect, that 
many 
of the prisoners could have vanished into thin air and might 
even have reached the major cities. It is believed, in this 
respect, that among the escapees are all the "emirs" of the 
armed groups that had been arrested and convicted by the special 
courts. 
  Despite the seriousness of this deed and despite the shock 
that the people have been dealt, official information is 
distilled parsimoniously when it exists. This silence gives free 
rein to all sorts of hypotheses and all sorts of speculations. 
  Whereas the news had practically gone around the country and 
even beyond it, 72 hours had to pass before the Justice Ministry 
would at last deign to make the information public in a most 
laconic communique. 
  The Justice Ministry's communique spoke of "a very large 
number of armed groups," which attacked the prison without 
specifying their number or the methods they used. Furthermore 
the communique described the breakout of "a large number of 
persons convicted in cases of terrorism by assassination and 
acts of sabotage and subversion"; here too no further 
information was given. 
  Given this, and according to tradition, all sorts of 
speculations were permissible. Beginning the following Saturday, 
LIBERTE devoted its front page to the event with the headline: 
"Breakout of 900 Islamic fundamentalists." Basing its report on 
information received from reliable sources, LIBERTE pointed out 
that the attack had been carried out by "a great many 
terrorists, perhaps several hundred"; the attack was reported to 
have been carried out with trucks, which therefore, according to 
LIBERTE's source, made possible the breakout of "900 terrorists, 
including 280 who had been sentenced to death"; about 100 of the 
regular prisoners were reported to have been tempted by the 
breakout but were said to have "given it another thought and 
returned to the prison." 
  For its part, AFP, picked up by EL WATAN and EL KHABAR, 
spoke 
of "several hundred prisoners" reported to have escaped, among 
whom were some who had been condemned to death. AFP, which 
quoted "confirming reliable sources," added that when the prison 
was attacked, four prison guards had been killed by "an 
undetermined number of assailants." The French agency put 
forward the number of 280 Islamic fundamentalists sentenced to 
heavy labor who were reported to be among the escapees, whereas 
"about 100 ordinary prisoners were reported to have returned to 
their cells after a brief escape." 
  Almost five days after the most spectacular of the 
breakouts, 
the entire national press corps came back to the event. Most of 
them preferred not to get involved, preferring to publish a 
communique drawn up by the security services and reported by APS. 
  Just as laconic as the Ministry of Justice's, the communique 
from the security services said only that a total of 79 persons 
who had escaped had been arrested whereas 24 others had been 
shot by police. At no time did the communique speak of the 
prisoners' status, it was simply a matter of "people arrested," 
"escapees," and "attackers." 
  Nowhere was there mention of "terrorists" or "Islamic 
fundamentalists." Was this caution or a determination to 
minimize the facts? 
  The other main daily newspapers devoted their front page to 
the event and cited figures that were sometimes contradictory 
but all wondered about the disconcerting ease with which the 
breakout had been accomplished. 
  EL WATAN no longer talked about "several hundred prisoners" 
but of "about 1,000 prisoners," among whom, the paper noted, 
there were "64 from the high security unit reserved for those 
sentenced to death and 400 prisoners serving life sentences." 
  There was another detail about the 1,000 escapees: "200 are 
ordinary prisoners." 
  EL WATAN devoted its front-page headline to the figures and 
announced in yesterday's edition that "26 escapees have been 
killed and 114 captured." 
  That, according to EL WATAN, was "the official figure." But 
would not the one given out by the police be the official 
figure? EL WATAN, which put the number of attackers at "some 100 
attackers," no longer put forward, as it had in its Saturday 
edition, the number of 280 Islamic fundamentalists among the 
escapees. 
  LIBERTE, which in its edition yesterday reported new 
information, corrected the figure of 280 prisoners sentenced to 
die among the escapees, published in its Saturday edition, and 
this time spoke of 70 prisoners sentenced to die being among the 
escapees. With regard to the number of attackers, and according 
to its sources, LIBERTE estimated the number of armed attackers 
who reportedly attacked the prison as being between 150 and 200, 
going on to add that the latter had arrived onboard "about 40 
trucks and encircled the prison." 
  This time around the number of escapees was put at being on 
the order of 909. Several other pieces of information concerning 
the breakout were reported by LIBERTE, which did not fail to 
wonder about the impact of such an operation. The daily 
newspaper EL MOUDJAHID, which ran the story only five days 
later, made up for lost time by publishing an article written on 
location by one of its reporters. 
  Many details were reported, including the length of the 
breakout operation, which was reported to have lasted "one hour 
and 15 minutes." LE MATIN was practically the only newspaper not 
to deal with this story. It was an odd silence. 
  Whereas the number of escapees was put by all newspapers at 
being around 900 people, an AFP release, citing a spokesman for 
the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] living abroad, mentioned the 
figure of 1,684 escapees and the fact that these escapees were 
"all political prisoners from FIS's base." Indeed, in this 
instance, this increase in the figures is, we might say, fair 
play, encouraged, it should be pointed out, by the laconic 
communiques from the concerned official authorities. 
  Since Thursday, the date of the attack on the prison, rumors 
have traveled about and already the most improbable scenarios 
have been put forward as we await the results from the official 
commission of inquiry.

<F P=106> [Article by Yacine Lahcene: "Arms Trafficking Hubs"] </F>
  [Text] The dismantling of terrorist networks and quantities 
of arms seized in their vicinity offer convincing evidence... 
  Arms trafficking was a booming business in Algeria in the 
late 1980's. But it has increased to a dangerous extent in the 
last two years, with proliferation of terrorist groups that are 
the principal beneficiaries. 
  Transported to Algeria in a number of different ways, these 
weapons, often in large quantities, have ended up at the same 
drop points in almost every instance: Setif, Khenchela, M'Sila, 
Medea, or (less frequently) Chlef and Batna. Witness the 
numerous hauls made by the security services in the last two 
years. 
  Undoubtedly most spectacular was the raid at Setif that led 
to the dismantling, almost exactly a year ago, of the largest 
clandestine network to appear since independence. No less than 
100 individuals, including traffickers, "fences," artisanal 
weapons (fabricators) were arrested and 842 weapons captured. 
And this was but the tip of the iceberg, since security services 
went on several days later to make other arrests, as the 
trafficking ring had branches in many other wilayas. 
  Altogether more than 500 traffickers were apprehended. 
Investigation disclosed that the majority were black-market 
operators. 
  A second large arms trafficking network was dismantled in 
Setif. Beretta and Perfecta automatic pistols were among the 
weapons seized. 
  Earlier on, the National Gendarmerie had neutralized 32 
persons involved in a network formed in the Khenchela and Batna 
regions. 
  In Central province, more specifically in Medea, the 
National 
Gendarmerie made another spectacular haul, not only dismantling 
the network and seizing the weapons but also discovering and 
destroying a laboratory for gun modification and artisanal bomb 
fabrication. This dismantling of an international networking for 
trafficking in weapons of war was a triumph for security forces, 
but one that also vividly illustrated the current of arms 
trafficking. The main leaders of this ring, 10 in number, were 
arrested and imprisoned. 
  A number of other networks were also dismantled during this 
two-year period, including those at Mila and M'Sila. But that 
certainly does not mean all the networks in Algeria have been 
shut down. There are still many others to continue provisioning 
the terrorist groups--with the complicity, naturally, of certain 
foreign countries that are always ready to provide traffickers 
with facilities and support in this domain.

<F P=106> [Article by D.J. Ammar: "Secret Dialogue and the FIS </F>
(Islamic Salvation Front)"] 
  [Text] In his speech to the nation, Mr. Zeroual reaffirmed 
his commitment to a "nonexclusive" national dialogue. 
  Although the president, who categorically rejects violence, 
has discouraged speculation about contacts with the armed 
groups, those groups that have not committed "irreparable acts" 
are being urged to come to reason. But no one is saying what 
constitutes "irreparable." 
  One may thus assume contacts with the political wing of the 
FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] are continuing and perhaps 
intensifying; this may explain recent statements by the party's 
overseas spokesmen. 
  It is very likely that the FIS's overseas delegation--and 
Anwar Haddam (in Washington) in particular--have been contacted 
by important regime figures as part of the search for 
representative interlocutors of the movement. 
  This is what generally reliable sources are saying, and what 
seems to be behind the surprising statement made by Anwar 
Haddam, in the United States, calling for cessation of terrorist 
attacks and condemning violence. 
  Earlier, feelers regarding dialogue had been put out to Mr. 
Haddam, and he was not the only target. It has been learned that 
all the "shuyukh" of the FIS's "Majlis al-Shura" have been at 
least approached by high-level officials. 
  It is expected that four interlocutors eventually will be 
chosen, beginning with Ali Djeddi, who is currently in detention 
in Blida and considered to be Abassi Madani's "gray eminence." 
  There have been many rumors about the possibility of FIS 
being represented by its principal leaders, Abassi Madani and 
Ali Benhadj, both currently in prison. According to our sources, 
they have indeed been contacted. 
  In substance, Abassi Madani is supposed to have told the men 
who urged him to enter into talks: "Release me. I will give a 
sermon at the Es Sunna mosque, then I will organize a national 
march, to stop the violence..." Reportedly his interlocutors 
counterproposed, less generously, an estoppel of prosecution on 
charges pending against him, with a possible transfer to house 
arrest if he were to help bring about a solution to the crisis. 
  Madani reportedly also demanded resumption of the electoral 
process starting from the situation that prevailed at the time 
it was disrupted in January 1992. In other words, that the FIS 
keep the 188 seats it won in December 1991. 
  The initially uncooperative Ali Benhadj reportedly has now 
accepted the idea of FIS participation in dialogue. Thus, 
according to Mr. Youcef Khatib, president of the NDC [National 
Dialogue Commission], conversations with the FIS are now 
focusing on concrete details. It remains to be seen on what 
basis and within what framework the new dialogue will be 
situated. 
  It has also been learned that the FIS would get 40 seats on 
the National Transition Council. It seems that this number is 
now quite firm; barring last-minute coalitions, it would put all 
the other political parties in a minority position, since the 
political sector only gets 85 out of the 200 seats (another 85 
for associations and organizations, 30 for the state). 
  But that has not yet happened. As things stand now, the FIS 
is really in a position to throw a monkey wrench into the 
process.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Ferhat: "Weapons for the Killers"] </F>
  [Text] The recent seizure of weapons aboard an Algerian 
vessel has revived questions about how arms are getting to 
Algeria. 
  Neither the official Algerian news service, which first 
reported the seizure, nor the broadcast news service, which 
showed pictures of the weapons seized, has provided any further 
information on the subject. No information has been released 
regarding date or place of the seizure. All we can be sure of is 
that the weapons were destined for armed terrorist groups active 
in Algeria. And it is not the first time. Some countries known 
for overt collusion with the Islamist movement appear to be 
behind this illicit trafficking, which they encourage, either 
directly by supplying arms or indirectly by providing the funds 
to purchase them. Leaders of the dissolved FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front] received arms delivery offers from several 
countries following the interruption of the electoral process, 
and even much earlier. Heading the list were Iran and Israel. 
The numerous weapons of Israeli manufacture (Uzi) found in the 
possession of terrorists arrested by security services--for 
example, in connection with last year's attack on Boughezoul 
barracks--have confirmed that Israel was involved, at least 
indirectly. 
  Iran, which gave its full support to the emergence on the 
national scene of the now-dissolved FIS, had no scruples at the 
time about selling it--with Israel's approval--Uzis acquired 
during its war with Iraq. The $3 million, which the Terrorist 
International, made available to the FIS last year on the eve of 
Ramadan was used to pay for the acquisition. Other countries are 
suspected of serving as intermediaries or directly financing 
weapons purchases for armed groups active in Algeria. The prime 
minister, Mr. Redha Malek, openly criticized certain European 
countries last December for their reckless statements about 
Algeria, even going so far as to point out to them that some of 
the arms purchases for Algerian terrorists are made in Europe. 
Also, during the trial of the authors of the attack on Algiers 
airport, one of the defendants clearly and directly implicated 
one of the major hubs of international terrorism--Sudan, in this 
case--in financing weapons purchases for armed Algerian 
terrorist groups. While the involvement of certain countries in 
financing arms purchases for Algerian armed groups may be taken 
as firmly established, a measure of uncertainty still prevails 
regarding the involvement of other countries in transporting 
these weapons to Algeria. On several occasions, Algerian 
security services have focused on the Moroccan connection, and 
President Liamine Zeroual, before his investiture, noted the 
threat on the country's western borders. In 1991, Moroccan 
security services reportedly signed with their Iranian 
counterparts an accord that would make Morocco a transit center 
for African fundamentalists. This report--which authorities have 
never denied--appears to have been well-founded, in that several 
armed individuals have since been intercepted by Algerian 
security along the border between Algeria and Morocco. There was 
also the Libyan connection, in particular the fact that the 
wilaya of Illizi on the Moroccan border has served as a drop 
point in recent years for Libya-based smugglers. 
  The cooperation afforded by reputedly "fraternal" countries 
in transporting arms destined for terrorist cells was for a time 
of such serious concern that consideration was given to closing 
the borders with those two countries, especially the Moroccan 
border, which was reopened in 1988 during the Chadli presidency. 
  Many of the facts about the security forces' recent seizure 
of arms on a ship flying the Algerian flag are still hidden from 
view, but it is a good bet that in the end the truth will not 
come as a big surprise to anyone...

<F P=106> [Editorial by Salim Ghazi: "The Plot"] </F>
  [Text] So what is happening at the National Liberation 
Front [FLN]? For several days, judging from all appearances, 
Mehri's party has been coping with serious problems with its 
base. At least if one believes information that has come in 
initially from Biskra, then Skikda, and finally Algiers, a 
growing protest movement is reported to be in the process of 
taking shape to call the party's current leadership to order. 
  In Biskra and Skikda, two cities reputed to be solid FLN 
bastions, there were many militants who said publicly that they 
could no longer recognize themselves in the Mehri team, which 
has refused to condemn terrorism, the very team that 
assassinated many militants from its base in a cowardly manner. 
  In Algiers the anger has grown within a provisional 
committee 
"for the holding of an extraordinary FLN congress" to denounce 
the suicidal positions of this same leadership. Most decidedly, 
while Mehri continues to distance himself from the government 
and sets down conditions to restart the dialogue, the base is 
grumbling. 
  It is true that not all of the FLN's militants have spoken, 
but such reactions, coming spontaneously as they do from the 
masses, are significant for more than one reason. They convey 
the notion that there is a serious difference between the base 
and the summit. 
  Indeed, more democratization is being demanded of a party 
that today appears, given its leadership's image, to be 
completely overwhelmed by events. If so, then Mehri runs the 
risk of paying a high price for his overly refined game, which 
has made his once single political party an objective ally of 
the obscurantist stripe. 
  The base, which appears to be asking that the glorious FLN 
of 
1954-62 be restored to history, wants greater dynamism and a 
leadership that is closer to democratic aspirations. It is not 
known whether Hamrouche is playing a part in this plot, which 
resembles a mini underground revolution waiting to break out 
into broad daylight.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Ferhat: "Faced With a Resurgence of </F>
Assassinations and Acts of Sabotage, the State Reacts: The 
National People's Assembly (ANP) on the Spot"--first paragraph 
is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] It is reported that major antiterrorist measures 
will soon be considered. 
  The country's authorities are, it seems, firmly determined 
to 
put every chance on their side to conduct the national dialogue 
under the best security conditions. According to well-informed 
sources, major decisions are reported to have been considered in 
this regard at a recent three-day meeting of top military 
leaders. A beefing up of security forces is reported to have 
been decided upon. So the main units and barracks are reported 
to have been put on a state of alert and received major 
reinforcements of men and materiel. Information reporting the 
deployment of military units and troop movements in the interior 
of the country and around the capital would tend to corroborate 
this on-site return by the state. According to our sources, the 
meeting of the heads of military staffs is also reported to have 
studied the eventual need for a partial mobilization of reserve 
forces so as to enhance the presence of the National People's 
Assembly [ANP] in urban centers and villages. This last measure 
would have more of a psychological than a military import. 
Terrorist propaganda does not cease pummeling people's minds 
with rumors suggesting that they hold the country in their grip. 
This reassertion by the state will also be seen through a more 
decentralized logistic system in the antiterrorist fight. It 
will be implemented at the national and regional levels, 
especially in each major city and at local coordinating military 
headquarters combining the ANP, the national gendarmerie, and 
the police. This system will allow for a better flow of security 
information but also for greater efficiency and speed in 
operations. The justice system also has its role to play in this 
new strategy. So sentences and general capital punishment orders 
in the special jurisdictions will henceforth be carried out 
speedily. It was probably with this in mind that the special 
court, following several weeks' worth of postponements of major 
trials, restarted its sessions, handing down six convictions 
carrying the death penalty. It would appear that in the future 
terrorists, in particularly those picked up who are armed, will 
be punished in exemplary fashion. Among other measures that have 
been mentioned, the heads of the national defense force are 
reported to have discussed ways of eliminating the armed groups' 
support and arms supply networks. The issue of closing the 
borders with Morocco was reported to have been brought up. The 
country's vast border areas, owing to the contraband trade, are 
indeed being used to bring in subversive elements and documents 
but in particular weapons, despite the vigilance of the 
gendarmerie and the customs service. 
  The deterioration of the security situation is such that 
even 
a state of emergency has been considered. It was, according to 
our sources, supposed to have been instituted before 24 March, 
but developments on the political scene and in particular the 
restart of the national dialogue have, it would seem, helped 
postpone this measure. It remains to be seen whether these 
decisions will be enforced in one overall step or gradually. 
  However, it develops from this redeployment by the state 
that 
the overall security formula has not been completely abandoned. 
  That formula will be used in parallel with "the political 
solution," in other words discussions with political and social 
forces. The government, which has increased its appeasement 
gestures (closing the camps in the south, freeing Boukhamkham 
and Djeddi, and suspending executions), has been poorly 
understood, if we may put it that way, by the terrorists. The 
latter have interpreted the government's attitude as a sign of 
weakness and stepped up the violence. The policy of concessions 
has given them the illusion that the reins of power were within 
their grasp.

<F P=106> [Article: "Proposal To Sign GATT Opposed"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Opposition members in the Rajya 
Sabha today vociferously opposed the Government's proposal to 
sign the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and urged 
it to be cautious of the U.S. designs to intimidate through 
Super 301 developing countries like India for their refusal to 
toe the American line. 
  Raising the issue during zero hour, Mr. Gurudas Das Gupta 
(CPI) (Communist Party of India) referred to reports of U.S. arm 
twisting with Japan to set right its huge trade imbalance and 
wondered if Japan could be meted out such treatment, would a 
country like India be spared. Accusing the Government of 
maintaining a studied silence on such a serious issue, Mr. Gupta 
urged it to give a statement on the present position. 
<H5>  Be Alert, Government Urged </H5>
  The issue was widely supported by all Opposition members who 
wanted the Union Government to be alert against any move by 
America to invoke the Super 301 Trade Act. Mr. Gupta wanted to 
know the sanctity of the Dunkel draft if the U.S. was allowed to 
indulge in armtwisting and asked why India was rushing to sign 
the GATT. 
  Mr. Das Gupta said Japan was one of the U.S.'s biggest trade 
partners and the U.S. could take retaliatory action after 
identifying what constituted unfair trade practice, although it 
could not impose any trade sanctions under the provisions of 
Super 301. 
<H5>  Debate Sought </H5>
  Mr. I.K. Gujral (JD) (Janata Dal) demanded the scrapping of 
Super 301 and said the U.S. stand was nothing short of "economic 
bullying." He pleaded for an exhaustive debate on the GATT 
proposals before India became a signatory to the Treaty. 
  Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) 
deplored the U.S. attitude of imposing economic sanctions 
against Japan. "If India is not careful, the U.S. will corner us 
on Kashmir or force us to sign the NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) 
and even dictate our missile technology programme," he said. 
  Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPM) (Communist Party of India-Marxist) and 
Mr. Kamal Morarka (SJP) demanded an explanation from the 
Commerce Minister as a response to the concern of the House and 
demanded that India should not compromise its sovereignty. 
<H5>  Using Super 301 as Weapon </H5>
  Mr. Jagesh Desai (Cong-I) said that because of India's firm 
position on issues like Kashmir, the U.S. could be tempted to 
use Super 301 as a weapon and India should be on the guard. He 
maintained that the U.S. could be using Super 301 against Japan 
inview of the huge trade deficit. 
  In response to persistent demand from members for a 
statement 
on the issue, the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, 
Dr. Abrar Ahmed, told the House that a special discussion on 
GATT was scheduled on March 9 and 10.

  [Text] Prague March 18 (CTK) -- The Immunology and 
Microbiology Institute based in Techonin, East Bohemia, has 
focused only on the defence research of the regulation of 
immunite reactions and of anti-viral and immunomodulative 
preparations, not on bacteriological weapons, Professor Josef 
Fusek told CTK today. 
  Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical Academy, to which 
the Techonin institute belongs, was reacting to articles 
published by the Czech press on Thursday [17 March] and today, 
according to which the institute developed dangerous species of 
bacteria and viruses destined for the production of biological 
weapons. 
  The right-leaning daily CESKY DENIK reports that such 
substances have been stored in several places in the Czech 
Republic. 
  "Biological weapons have never been developed, produced or 
stored here. The institute was not constructed for such 
activities. The institute has never been asked to do such 
work," Fusek said. 
  The Czech Republic has fulfilled -- without exception -- the 
convention which bound it not to develop, produce or store 
chemical weapons. The premises of the mentioned institute were 
opened to an international inspection in May 1990, he stressed. 
  Fusek also dismissed the allegation by CESKY DENIK that 
germs 
of cholera, plague and other dangerous substances were used in 
the institute. 
  The Czech Defence Ministry has not so far commented on the 
issue, which, according to a ministry spokesperson, will be 
taken up at a ministry press conference today.

<F P=106> ["(lek)"-signed report: "The Military Institute Did Not </F>
Develop Biological Weapons, Says Propper"] 
  [Text] Hradec Kralove -- The former Military Research 
Institute in Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains (now the J.E. 
Purkyne Military Medical Academy Institute of Immunology and 
Microbiology) did not develop in the past -- nor is it doing so 
at present -- bacteriological weapons. This statement was made 
yesterday by Petr Propper, the institute's former director. 
"The institute dealt exclusively with defense-related 
research," he said. 
  Propper described as false the claim in CESKY DENIK that 
dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses, in whose development 
the Techonin-based research institute was involved, are stored 
in various locations in the Czech Republic. 
  According to Josef Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical 
Academy in Hradec Kralove, no bacterial or viral strains with 
transmuted immunological properties were ever developed at the 
institute. Fusek also denied that cholera, plague, smallpox, 
meningitis, or psittacosis germs would have been stored in the 
institute's laboratory. According to him, the research 
concerned other infectious diseases, for example, tularaemia. 
  A commission of experts visited the Techonin institute last 
week -- on the order of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys -- where 
they carried out an inspection and destroyed the cultures that 
will no longer be used for current research, said Fusek. 
  According to staff from the Charles University Faculty of 
Medicine Institute of Microbiology, strains of all the existing 
bacteria and viruses -- including cholera, plague, smallpox, and 
other diseases -- are stored in a number of microbiological 
laboratories. The way they store and dispose of them is, of 
course, subject to the regulations of the World Health 
Organization, which rules out any threat to the population. 
  The Defense Ministry will not, according to its Press 
Department, respond to the report in CESKY DENIK.

  [Text] Prague, March 18 (CTK) -- Former Czechoslovak 
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said today he knew nothing 
about dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses designated for 
the production of biological weapons having been stored in the 
Czech Republic. 
  Dienstbier, foreign minister from December 1989 until June 
1992, told journalists that at the time when he was a 
Czechoslovak cabinet member, the possibility of nuclear, 
biological or chemical weapons being stored on Czechoslovak 
territory was investigated. "The Army had revised these things 
and.... as far as I know nothing was found," Dienstbier said. 
  Petr Pithart, Czech premier from February 1990 until June 
1992, told CTK that "he had no idea" about biological weapons 
being stored in the Czech Republic. He added, however, that the 
army was not within the jurisdiction of the Czech government. 
He said it could have happened that "something was forgotten 
somewhere" but the question could not be linked to political 
motives. 
  Some Czech papers reported on Thursday [17 March] and today 
that Czechoslovakia was charged with developing bacteriological 
weapons in the framework of the former Warsaw Pact. A secret 
branch of the Military Research Institute located in the 
vicinity of the village of Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains, 
east Bohemia, allegedly served this goal. The cultures of 
bacteria and viruses developed there were allegedly hidden at 
different place in the Czech Republic. 
  According to press reports, this would mean not only 
violation of the Czech Republic's international commitments 
since it is a signatory of the Geneva Convention whose members 
had pledged not to develop, use or store biological weapons 
without international consent, but also crime threatening the 
public. 
  Chairman of the Czech Parliament's Defense and Security 
Committee Vladimir Suman has asked Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys on Thursday to inform the committee about the alleged 
storage of bacteriological and virological weapons in the Czech 
Republic on April 7. Suman told journalists this today at a 
press conference of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of which he 
is a member.

  [Text] Prague, March 18 (CTK) -- Czech Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys today denied the presence of biological weapons 
in the Czech Republic, reported by the press on Thursday [17 
March]. 
  However, he told journalists that two banks of virus strains 
which were used in research and for protection and defense 
purposes were destroyed at his order. 
  He said in February he had been informed about the existence 
of a bank of virus strains used in research in the Central 
Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice. 
  The same applies to a similar bank in the Immunology and 
Microbiology Institute of the Military Medical Academy in 
Techonin, east Bohemia, of which he was informed in March. 
  These banks of virus strains were destroyed as there was no 
further need in them, Baudys said, adding that the bank in the 
Stresovice hospital was destroyed on February 25, and the bank 
in Techonin at the beginning of March. 
  Baudys said a commission of experts from the Defense and 
Health Ministries had been set up to study the matter. The 
experts took necessary safety measures and destroyed the 
strains. He said these substances were stored in minimum 
amounts for medical purposes as they were used in research and 
therefore served the defense purposes. They did not have the 
nature of biological weapons and their storage did not 
contradict the Geneva Convention through which the Czech 
Republic had pledged not to develop, produce or store biological 
weapons. 
  Baudys said he wanted to calm down the Czech public. He was 
thus reacting to press reports on Thursday and today according 
to which dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses have been 
developed in the Military Medical Academy in Techonin to be used 
for the production of biological weapons. The daily CESKY DENIK 
wrote that these substances were stored at several places in the 
Czech Republic. "These reports can "incite people's fantasy," 
Baudys said. 
  Specialists present at the press conference confirmed that 
the virus strains designated for diagnostics were safely stored 
in liquid nitrogen and their liquidation was also safe. They 
said a bank of virus strains was created in the Techonin 
institute in 1970- 1980 and was used for research, primarily for 
the production of sera. 
  "Banal" strains, for example, viruses causing influenza made 
up 80 percent of the strains stored in the bank, while only 20 
percent were "especially dangerous and exotic" strains, director 
of the Military Academy Vladimir Radovnicky said. He said there 
was also a bank of diagnostic sera in the institute and this 
will be preserved. 
  Ales Macela, pro-rector for research in the Military Medical 
Academy, said the institute in Techonin was opened in 1972. He 
said he had been working there since 1975 and there had never 
been conditions there for the production of a larger amount of 
microbes necessary to produce biological weapons. 
  He said the institute was dealing with immunological 
research 
and, among other things, with testing preparations. Tissues and 
animals were used for this purposes. The institute is not 
"particularly secret" and is accessible to foreign experts as 
well, Macela said, adding that Swedish specialists visited the 
institute last year.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "The Viral and </F>
Bacterial Strains Stored in the Central Military Hospital Are 
Destroyed Posthaste"] 
  [Text] In the CESKY DENIK on Thursday and Friday [17 and 
18 March, see referent item], we have reported the existence of 
still- maintained bacterial and viral strains developed for use 
as biological weapons. According to the findings by the CESKY 
DENIK reporters, one of the banks of these strains was concealed 
in the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice. 
  Yesterday, Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys called an 
extraordinary news conference; as he phrased it, "just to calm 
down the public." 
  Antonin Baudys declared that he was first informed about the 
existence of the particularly dangerous viruses and bacteria on 
13 February of this year. Subsequently, he received more 
information from various sources on 17 February. On the basis 
of this information, an interdepartmental commission was formed, 
in which Health Ministry experts were also represented. The 
commission, according to Baudys, investigated and assessed the 
situation, and also decided to liquidate the biological bank 
quickly because it was "no longer useful." The bacterial and 
viral cultures were also destroyed under extraordinary security 
measures between 24 and 25 February with the knowledge and 
instructions of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Army Chief 
of Staff Nekvasil. Furthermore, Baudys said that similar 
measures were also taken in the Techonin Military Research 
Institute at the beginning of March. It was precisely in this 
Institute that, according to the CESKY DENIK sources, biological 
weapons for the Warsaw Pact were developed. According to claims 
by the military representatives, however, this bank of 
biological cultures was a commonplace affair, and their 
maintenance did not violate any international treaties. 
  An employee of the Techonin Military Research Institute, 
Ales 
Macela, stated that in the facility where he works, no viral or 
bacterial strains have been cultivated for use in biological 
warfare. Moreover, he claimed that all documentation about the 
research has remained in Techonin. According to him, the 
research was conducted for defense purposes only. According to 
CESKY DENIK sources, however, the documentation was transferred 
to Prague under extraordinary security measures at the beginning 
of March. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Kalousek said that the Klinlab 
company had leased nonresidential premises in the Central 
Military Hospital building. It was precisely in the 
laboratories operated by this company that the bank of viral and 
bacterial cultures that were quickly destroyed on 25 February 
was stored.

<F P=106> [Lubor Kohout commentary: "From Baudys' Realm of Fantasy"] </F>
  [Text] Fairy tales are meant for children; of course, some 
adults like them too. Especially the old, traditional ones. 
The appeal of modern fairy tales is not so strong. Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys, with the support of his subordinates, 
told us one like this last Friday [18 March]. The minister 
deemed it necessary to respond to the articles published in 
CESKY DENIK. They claimed that strains of bacteria and viruses 
intended for use as the basis for biological weapons are being 
stored (or concealed) in our military facilities. 
  If we summarize the statements made by the ministerial and 
army top brass, this is what we get: Bacteriological and 
virological weapons were never developed in our secret military 
facilities, and not at all for the purposes of the Warsaw Pact. 
The institute in Techonin never took part in such activity; the 
scientists in its laboratories only worked on immunological 
research. According to Ales Macela, the current vice president 
of the Military Medical Academy and a leading research worker at 
the Techonin institute, there were no technical conditions in 
his institute for achieving genetic changes in individual 
strains. The two batches of strains of bacteria and viruses -- 
the one in Techonin and the one that was kept in the building 
leased to the Klinlab (Clinical Laboratories) limited company in 
the Central Military Hospital in Stresovice -- were simply 
harmless batches prepared in case the state was involved in a 
defense emergency. Moreover, 80 percent of them were common 
viruses and a mere 20 percent were exotic viruses. Summa 
summarum: By storing the aforementioned strains, the army in no 
way violated the international convention on prohibiting the 
use, development, and accumulation of biological weapons. The 
interdepartmental commission, whose establishment was initiated 
by Baudys, decided that it was no longer necessary to keep the 
strains and, therefore, the viral banks were destroyed. 
Absolutely nothing happened -- irresponsible journalists from 
CESKY DENIK just want to injure our army. 
  In considering whether it is CESKY DENIK or the gentlemen 
from the Defense Ministry and the army who are telling fairy 
tales, it is enough to recall some of the facts confirmed by 
Minister Baudys himself and Chief of the General Staff Nekvasil: 
On 13 February, in connection with the personnel changes in the 
military health service department, Baudys finds out for the 
first time about the existence of batches of strains. An 
investigation follows, and on 17 February an interdepartmental 
commission is set up on Baudys' initiative. The swift 
destruction of the first batch in Stresovice begins during the 
next seven days. The defense minister personally orders the 
destruction. The chief of the General Staff also gives his 
personal guarantee that the destruction was carried out safely 
and that there was no risk. On 9 March the ministerial and army 
top brass receive the news that there is another batch of 
strains in Techonin in East Bohemia. Another swift destruction 
follows. 
  Other facts, not mentioned by Baudys, speak plainly. The 
whole affair has been investigated since the beginning by 
officers from Military Defense Intelligence (VOZ), who were 
present at the destruction along with the Military Police. VOZ 
is also taking care of the Techonin research documentation; of 
course, on Friday Ales Macela claimed that it is still stored in 
Techonin. The Defense Ministry is handing over part of the case 
to the Security and Information Service. What on earth for? 
After all, only allegedly "common and no longer necessary" 
strains were destroyed! 
  There were several ways Minister Baudys could have acted 
before Friday. One of these was telling the truth. He could 
have said that genetically altered viruses and bacteria 
developed for use as biological weapons had been concealed 
without his knowledge. He could have admitted that they are 
still -- in all probability -- "stored" in other, so far 
unknown, places. He chose another course of action, and thus 
associated himself with the people who had developed and 
concealed these materials. Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chairman Jiri Payne declared yesterday that the whole 
incident has to be thoroughly investigated. It only remains for 
me to add that, if CESKY DENIK has not reported the truth, the 
authors of the articles are, according to the law, criminally 
liable. They could, for example, have committed the crime of 
spreading alarming reports. If the defense minister is familiar 
with the criminal law, then he knows that he is required to 
submit a complaint. He will probably not do so, however, and he 
knows why. The ministerial fairy tales would not be enough to 
obtain a conviction in a law-governed state.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes commentary: "About Deputy Minister Kalousek's </F>
'Expedient Lie'"] 
  [Text] In the course of an extraordinary news conference 
called by the defense minister to calm down the public, Deputy 
Defense Minister Kalousek described the CESKY DENIK information 
about contributing to Klinlab equipment with Army supplies as an 
expedient lie. The deputy minister is apparently well-versed in 
the field so he knew what he was talking about. What he said 
was an expedient untruth. 
  This time around, we will not devote our attention to the 
problem of biological warfare agents (for, at this time, the 
explanation of the difference between an offensive and defensive 
cholera is beyond our ability). 
  We will leave that for some other time, including the 
military laboratories in Olesnice, as well as the equipment for 
the reproduction of viruses, with which the Techonin Research 
Institute was equipped despite the claims made by the Defense 
Ministry officials calming down the public. After all, it was 
from here that the Bulgarian, Romanian, GDR, and Russian experts 
-- who used to work here -- withdrew their research and 
documentation. 
  So, that is one group of expedient untruths. Let us, 
however, devote ourselves to the Klinlab Co., a company that 
operates in the building of the Military Hospital in 
[Prague-]Stresovice. It was precisely in the facility leased to 
Klinlab that the bank of "completely common viruses" was located 
that was destroyed on Defense Minister Baudys' order under 
extraordinary security measures. 
  First, already in 1992, expensive foreign-made equipment was 
bought for the Central Military Health Institution -- a 
laboratory glass washer, for instance, or an automatic analyzer 
-- just to guarantee a good future for the Central Military 
Hospital [UVN]. The purchases were made by the deputy chief of 
the Central Military Health Institution (UVZU), Dr. Moravek. 
The justification was that the UVZU would produce and market 
hygienically pure water for commercial purposes. Shortly 
thereafter, however, a questionnaire was circulated among the 
employees of this institution recruiting "experts" for the 
future private laboratory institute called Klinlab. The 
questionnaire was then used to justify (the people want it) the 
establishment of Klinlab. This company assumed, however, only 
the profit-making or profit promising part of the UVZU. Under 
the auspices of Economics Deputy Minister Kalousek, the company 
was authorized to manage the six-floor facility in the UVN by a 
contract dated 10 September 1993 and signed with the Army for 
Klinlab by no one else but Dr. Moravek, still an officer on 
active duty. He signed as the executive secretary of a company 
that had not yet been founded, much less registered. 
  This violates a good number of laws and regulations -- 
including the defense minister's order No. 9 of 11 February 1993. 
  Only a month after the signing of the lease (which leaves 
the 
owner with the obligations of the owner, including construction 
alterations), on 11 October 1993, the Klinlab company contract 
was signed, and only on 23 October 1993 is Klinlab entered on 
the company register. 
  In a state governed by rule of law, the contract would 
certainly be invalid. In a state governed by rule of law, the 
people signing such contracts would be considered cheats. 
Furthermore, Dr. Moravek and all the other officers from the 
Klinlab Ltd. who signed the contract brazenly violated Law 
143/1992 in its Article 3, Section 4 of the government 
instruction, according to which they are paid their salary with 
a 25 percent bonus provided they do not engage in business but 
only serve in the Army! 
  The Klinlab lease contract (let us assume that the same 
ministerial office is responsible for its organization, which 
refused other privatization projects, including one from Canada) 
rents the relevant part of the UVN for 720,123 korunas annually 
to the, of course, not yet existing legal entity, and the money 
was then lent to them interest-free for a fixed term, i.e., 
until the purchase contract is signed. All that happens on 1 
December 1993. Material and supplies worth dozens of millions is 
passed onto Klinlab without inventory, and when an inventory is 
taken of the furniture and equipment, it is calculated at 
write-off prices. Regarding the laboratory equipment valued at 
approximately 30 million korunas, then, Klinlab chooses what it 
needs and purchases (until the date of the purchase contract it 
will use it free of charge) the equipment at a later date. 
  So, this is the expedient lie about Engineer Kalousek of 
which we are guilty. 
  The military equipment that was profitable for the Army, 
including the equipment purchased for taxpayer's money, will 
pass into private hands. The money-losing equipment will be 
kept by the Army. 
  Of course, some soldiers wanted to object. That was an ill- 
advised idea. After all, the appropriate commission 
investigated it. Even Colonel Krizenecky put his iron in the 
fire, and so did Military Prosecutor Dr. Novak. The same one 
who was investigating but never concluded the investigation of 
the activities of another man of the Kalousek-type at the 
Defense Ministry, the current director of the Nase Vojsko [Our 
Army] publishing house, Jakub Cisar -- of course, that was still 
in the Orbis publishing house. 
  We will reach the stage of socialism in our country, we will 
be successful in defending the peace, and we will thwart the 
iniquitous activities of traitors, and so on along the arduous 
path towards a better tomorrow. The officers will get paid (by 
us, friends) for not engaging in business. They conduct 
business (with our money). Are we to believe that the sale of 
microbes, eventually to be thrown into a synagogue as an 
example, presents a problem for such enterprising entrepreneurs?

<F P=106> [Lubor Kohout commentary: "From Baudys' Realm of Fantasy II"] </F>
  [Text] We recently reported that a bank of viral strains 
was destroyed on 25 February under extraordinary security 
measures on the order of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. It 
had been stored in a building leased by the army to the Klinlab 
limited company. Then, at the beginning of March, under similar 
conditions, army experts destroyed yet another "common" batch of 
viral strains stored in the Military Research Institute in 
Techonin. The defense minister, the Chief of the General Staff 
Nekvasil, and other military top brass have described the two 
banks as common batches that had nothing to do with the 
development of biological weapons. Although, according to the 
claims made by the gentlemen from the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff, the two viral banks were stored safely and there 
was no risk of a leak or a potential threat to the population 
from the stored viruses, the subsequent conduct by the 
ministerial and military top brass is tantamount to the contrary. 
  The Stresovice bank of viruses was stored in a so-called 
nitrogen chamber. It is located in the second basement of the 
building belonging to the Klinlab company. A bank of tissue 
cultures was also deposited there alongside the "harmless and 
safely stored" viral bank. Tissue cultures are cellular lines 
intended for the reproduction of viruses in a living organism. 
The location in question was locked and only a limited number 
of staff from the Central Military Health Institute had access 
to the keys. The viruses and the tissue cultures were stored in 
containers full of liquid nitrogen, which has to be topped up 
once a week. Last August, one of the containers -- by 
coincidence, the one with the bank of tissue cultures -- was 
left open. All the nitrogen had evaporated and so the tissue 
cultures were destroyed. Of course, it takes more than a few 
minutes or hours for nitrogen to evaporate. According to the 
experts, it takes 5-7 days for this. Throughout this entire 
period, however, no one went into the nitrogen chamber or, if 
someone did, then he did not secure the container, despite the 
fact that it would have been impossible to overlook the 
unfastened lid and the escaping vapors. So, the batches of 
tissue cultures were destroyed. By the way, they were the 
largest in the Czech Republic and their procreation took 30 
years, which is another matter. 
  An investigation was initiated and conducted by the police 
in 
Prague 6. The culprit was not found. There are more 
variations. These include a -- relatively unlikely -- accident 
or oversight and -- more likely -- deliberate sabotage. In this 
event, another two possibilities can be taken into 
consideration: First, that the culprit or culprits intended to 
destroy what was actually destroyed, that is, the bank of tissue 
cultures. But why? Simply to make sure they do not exist? The 
second possibility is that this was a mistake and the other 
container with the viral bank should have been left open. In 
this case, dangerous viruses would have escaped into the 
surrounding environment and not only the patients and staff in 
the Central Military Hospital would have been placed under a 
direct risk. This could have been called, without exaggeration, 
a catastrophe. Understandably, there is also the possibility 
that someone wanted to remove, and perhaps even did remove, 
something from either of the banks. It is not difficult to 
guess for what purpose. One can only speculate about which 
country is supposed, for example, to have its source of drinking 
water infected. It just remains for me to add that, if the lid 
had stayed shut, then -- it goes without saying -- that no one 
would have had any idea that some unknown person had been in the 
nitrogen chamber. It is impossible to say whether he had 
visited it for the first time. So, this was the situation with 
the -- according to the defense minister -- "safely stored 
harmless and common viruses that were not intended for use as 
biological weapons." During their news conference, the defense 
minister and his retinue declared that nothing had in fact 
happened and that biological weapons have never been developed 
or stored in our country. The two rapidly -- and under 
extraordinary security measures -- destroyed viral banks were, 
according to them, common batches. Of course, they did not say 
a word about what happened in Stresovice last August. It would 
probably be difficult for them to say that there is no risk and 
that there was not a risk. It would also be difficult for them 
to say that everything is in order in the army and that 
biological weapons were never developed in it. It would be 
difficult for Deputy Minister Kalousek to talk nonsense and 
claim that the army will save 50 million by transferring some of 
the activity carried out hitherto by the Central Military Health 
Institute to the Klinlab limited company. And so on and so on.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- Czech Parliament today 
passed a government bill on foreign trade with military 
materials, which lays down conditions for such trade and 
determines the powers of state administrative bodies to enforce 
them. 
  Ministry of Trade and Industry Vladimir Dlouhy said the law 
stipulated conditions and procedures for granting permits on 
trade of foreign-made materials, and for granting licenses for 
specific trade deals. 
  According to the law, weapons of mass destruction, that is 
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, must not be included 
in any trade of military materials. The understanding of 
military materials includes, apart from technical equipment and 
its components, also services granted in this connection. 
  Trade with military material can now be conducted only by a 
legal entity based in the territory of the Czech Republic, 
following the receipt of a permit issued by the Industry and 
Trade Ministry and approval from the Foreign, Defense, and 
Interior Ministries. 
  "We shall be the first country of the former Eastern bloc to 
adopt independent legislation for this sensitive area, following 
the example of advanced countries," Dlouhy said. 
  The Industry and Trade Ministry will supervise adherence to 
the law. If it finds that a legal entity has broken any 
regulation of the law, it will be entitled to impose on it a 
fine of up to five million Czech crowns. If a breach of the law 
causes damage to the Czech Republic, the fine may be up to six 
times as high. 
  The weapons trade law also amends the Law on Small 
Businesses 
and the Penal Code. The amendment of the Penal Code rests in 
that the Law on Weapons Trade includes regulations prohibiting 
trade with military material. An individual, for instance, who 
engages in a deal with military material without permission or a 
license will receive a prison term of one to eight years, or can 
have further commercial activities prohibited and/or receive a 
fine.

  [Text] Manama, March 20 (AFP) - UN experts charged with 
eliminating President Saddam Husayn's chemical weapons program 
left Bahrain Sunday for a one-week inspection mission to Iraq, 
UN officials here said. 
  A five-member team led by American Gerald Brubaker was to 
take air samples from the former chemical weapons complex at 
al-Muthanna, west of the capital Baghdad, to search for the 
possible presence of chemical agents. 
  Iraq's chemical weapons were assembled at the site and most 
of them have since been destroyed. 
  A UN chemical weapons expert, Cees Wolterbreek of the 
Netherlands, said in December that he was "99 percent" certain 
that Iraq's chemical arsenal had been destroyed except for a few 
weapons and munitions. 
  The head of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq, 
Rolf 
Ekeus of Sweden, said on February 1 that he was still not 
completely satisfied with Iraq's answers about its chemical 
program. 
  The chemical team will be the first to visit Iraq since the 
UN Security Council decided Friday to continue sanctions against 
Baghdad which were imposed after the August 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
  For the first time the council members could not agree on an 
assessment of Iraq's compliance with disarmament resolutions 
ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  Russia, France, China and Brazil asked the council to 
recognize Iraqi "progress" toward disarmament but the United 
States and Britain rejected the request.

  [Text] Russia will resume the supply of nuclear fuel to 
Ukraine after it gets next week the $60 Mn promised by the U.S. 
This was reported at a briefing in Kiev on Tuesday by the 
Chairman for Ukraine's Atomic Energy Committee Mikhail Umanets 
after his discussion with Russia's Atomic Energy Minister Victor 
Mikhailov. 
  In the conversation with Umanets, Mikhailov blamed the 
breaking of the time-table for nuclear fuel delivery to Ukraine 
on Russia's failure to settle accounts with a fuel producing 
plant in Novosibirsk (East Siberia). 
  Umanets also reported that by his information the 
Novosibirsk 
plant was interested in the Ukrainian market since Ukraine had 
always been one of its major clients. 
  He declined to give concrete figures on fuel shipments on 
the 
ground that such information is classified. 
  He pointed out that the construction of a nuclear fuel plant 
in Ukraine was "an urgent national task." In his opinion, 
Ukraine has everything that is needed to cope with the task, 
including uranium ore, "which has been supplied to Russia and 
returned as ready-made fuel." 
  "The price at which we buy fuel in Russia amounts to 64 
percent of the prime cost of electricity generated in Ukraine. 
With the commencement of a state fuel producing plant, this 
indicator could be almost halved," Umanets said. 
  In his words, feasibility tests on such a project are to be 
completed this year.

  [Text] Following is the text of the Statement of the 
Presidents of the Baltic States on Coordination of Actions 
vis-a-vis EU, NATO, Other International Structures, and in 
Strengthening Stability in Europe: [begin text] 
  We, the Presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania met in 
Palanga, Lithuania on 25 March 1994, to discuss matters of 
mutual concern, in particular the integration of the three 
Baltic States with the economic, political and security 
structures of Europe. 
  We discussed our progress achieved to date in developing 
co-operation among our states in a number of fields. In this 
context, we noted the results of our Foreign Ministers' meeting 
in Riga on 23 March 1994, in particular the agreement in 
principle on the constitution of the Baltic Council of 
Ministers. We noted with satisfaction that the Free Trade 
Agreement between our states will come into force on 1 April 
1994 and we stressed the importance of continuing negotiations 
towards supplementing this agreement with a protocol on free 
trade in agricultural goods. 
  We also noted the progress made in deepening the cooperation 
between the Baltic Sea States during the last year. We 
expressed our conviction that the Council of the Baltic Sea 
States to be convened under the Estonian chairmanship in Tallinn 
on 24-25 May 1994 will stress the importance of discussing the 
establishment of the post of a CSCE High Commissioner on human 
rights and minority questions and of reaching agreement on 
international participation in the decommissioning of the 
Baldish nuclear facility. 
  We noted that the process of strengthening political and 
economic relations with the European Union should continue 
toward the aim of rapidly concluding Free Trade Agreements with 
the European Union, and expressed the hope that Association 
(Europe) Agreements would be subsequently concluded as soon as 
possible, and not later than the end of 1994. In this 
connection, we noted that associate membership status in the 
Western European Union would further contribute to security and 
stability in Europe. 
  We welcomed the efforts of NATO to strengthen ties with the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe and asserted that NATO 
is the main guarantor of security in the Baltic region. We 
expressed our conviction that increased cooperation with NATO 
within the Partnership for Peace programme will further enhance 
security and facilitate the Baltic States integration as full 
members. In this connection, we stressed the importance of 
President Clinton recently announced decision to lift the 
embargo on arms sales to the three Baltic States as a further 
confirmation of the rapid progress achieved in restoring 
democratic institutions and instituting market economies in our 
countries. 
  We hope that the Stability Pact initiated by the European 
Union will not only strengthen security and stability in Europe 
but also contribute to the advancement of the dialogue of the 
Baltic States with the EU and help us to promote full members of 
the EU on the same basis as the Visegrad countries and other 
countries with EU association agreements. 
  We also stressed the importance of the Ukraine's decision to 
join NATO's Partnership for Peace and expressed our conviction 
the Ukraine will pay an increasingly important role in ensuring 
continued stability and security in Europe and especially in the 
near vicinity of the Baltic Sea region. The recently concluded 
bilateral agreements signed between the Ukraine and Lithuania 
and Estonia respectively form a solid basis for further 
developing relations with the Ukraine in the economic, cultural, 
political and security fields. 
  We are reaffirmed our conviction that all Russian forces 
must 
be withdrawn from Estonia and Latvia by 31 August 1994. We 
called on the international community to continue monitoring the 
situation so that this date would be observed. The Presidents 
of Estonia and Lithuania welcomed the agreement on troop 
withdrawals initialed during the last round of Latvian-Russian 
negotiations. 
  We, the Presidents of the three Baltic States, expressed the 
hope that an agreement on troop withdrawals would be initialed 
at the upcoming Estonian-Russian round in April. 
  We stressed the need for international organizations to 
strictly monitor how the Skrunda radar facility will be 
utilized, to ensure that there are no negative consequences for 
those living in the area, that the facility will not be used as 
a military base, and that it will not compromise the sovereignty 
of Latvia. 
  The resolution of these outstanding issues will, we are 
convinced, stimulate more constructive and fruitful relations 
with Russia and increase stability and security in the Baltic 
Sea region. (end text)

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- Skilled specialists from 
research institutions and industrial enterprises are taking part 
in today's discussion in the State Duma of Russia's 
participation in international agreements on the destruction of 
chemical weapons. During the discussion they intend to work out 
Russia's political course in the quest for economically 
advantageous and ecologically acceptable ways of disarmament, 
Professor Viktor Kholstov, doctor of chemistry, who took part in 
the discussion, told ITAR-TASS. 
  According to Dr. Kholstov, "the chemical disarmament process 
has a ten-year history. Russia is honestly living up to its 
commitments." He believes, however, that now there is rivalry 
between supporters of two entirely different ways of the 
implementation of the disarmament programme. Some experts 
believe that toxic agents should be destroyed according to 
Western technologies, while others insist on the use of domestic 
technologies, which, by the way, bring in substantial profits 
and ensure ecological safety. 
  According to specialists, major countries of the world have 
become a scene of competition in the sphere of the production 
and sale of super-pure chemical substances, specifically 
arsenic, which is the only chemical element that could be used 
in heleo- installations, capable of replacing all other energy 
sources in the 21st century. American scientists are also 
working hard in this promising field. Fearful of competition, 
Western business people are trying to bar Russian arsenic, 
obtained in the process of the destruction of the toxic agent of 
lewisite, from the world market. According to Russian 
scientists, chemicals produced in Russia, which have a high 
level of purity, can oust products of competitors on the world 
market.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- "There are no toxic agents 
or wastes for a genuine chemist -- they are all raw materials," 
this precept by the great Russian chemist Dmitriy Mendeleyev was 
repeated time and again by scientists, who took the floor during 
the Duma hearings on Russia's participation in international 
agreements to scrap chemical weapons. Believing that Russia 
should derive definite benefits from the destruction of combat 
toxic agents, they moved to include in the state budget a 
separate item, envisaging spendings on disarmament and 
conversion programmes. Moreover, the scientists hold, it is 
necessary to launch a broad explanatory campaign and to discuss 
in a professional way all the problems linked with the 
destruction of weapons. 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Major-General Yuriy Tarasevich, 
assistant commander of radiation, chemical and biological 
defence forces of the Russian Federation, who took part in the 
deliberations, that a concept has already been drawn up for 
scrapping combat toxic substances, but this required special 
financing. Shortage of money for the development of special 
technologies, construction of various installations and other 
jobs, envisaged by the complex programme, retards the 
implementation of the already adopted decisions. 
  General Tarasevich believes that this year will be decisive 
for preparations to begin the planned destruction of chemical 
weapons. He denied rumours and publications on the alleged 
"incineration of chemical shells". "All the ammunition is being 
reliably guarded and poses no threat to the environment," 
Tarasevich said. He believes they could remain stored for 
several more years. "It would be wrong to shift the difficult 
job of destroying them to the next generation. There is every 
opportunity to do it now, relying on international agreements," 
Tarasevich noted.

  [Text] Deputy head of Russian forces for nuclear, chemical 
and biological defences General Yuriy Tarasevich speaking in 
parliament put the country's stockpile of chemical weapons 
subject to destruction under an international convention at 
40,000 tons. These are deployed at seven different sites and 
must be destroyed within a period of ten years. 
  He said that chemical weapons causing a blistering effect 
were among the first to be destroyed at two sites-in the 
villages of Kamarka (Udmurtia) and Gorny (Saratov Region). 
Tarasevich said the operation would cost Rbl [rubles] 500 Bn 
[billion] at last year's prices. The total spending for the 
destruction of all chemical weapons runs at Rbl 2.5 Tn 
[trillion]. 
  However, Tarasevich declined to say whether Russia was 
engaged in the development of new-generation chemical weapons on 
the grounds that this should be "the subject of a special 
session." 
  Head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control department Oleg 
Sokolov said it would be in Russia's interests to become one of 
the first of 65 signatories to ratify the convention on the 
destruction of chemical weapons. He said "negative implications 
from Russia's failure to do so are obvious." 
  For his part, chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov who was also 
involved in the hearings told reporters that Russia had offered 
to destroy 40,000 tons of chemical weapons though it had 
produced more than 400,000 tons. 
  In his view, the remainder was destroyed in a barbarous way 
without any elementary precautionary measures being taken, which 
in itself "is just as dangerous as the use of the weapon itself." 
  To begin with, an international commission of experts must 
be 
set up to find where and how those weapons were buried, he said. 
  Mirzayanov called for extending the destruction period from 
25 to 30 years given the enormous spending involved.

<F P=106> [Article by James Adams: "The Red Death"; Subtitled "The </F>
Untold Story of Russia's Secret Biological Weapons"; described 
as "Exclusive extract from The New Spies, his forthcoming book"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Pasechnik was born in 1937 in Stalingrad, a 
city soon to be ravaged by the second world war. He became one 
of the brightest young scientists in the Soviet Union, 
determined to use his talent in the cause of peace, never 
allowing his research in biophysics to play any part in the kind 
of destruction that had cost the lives of his family. 
  After graduation, he did research at the Institute of High 
Molecular Compounds in Leningrad, working on new antibiotics and 
treatments for supposedly incurable illnesses such as cancer. 
  In 1974 he was approached by a general from the Soviet 
Ministry of Defence with an irresistible offer: to set up and 
run a laboratory in Leningrad, with an unlimited budget to buy 
equipment in the West and recruit the best staff from all over 
the Soviet Union. It would be known as the Institute of Ultra 
Pure Biochemical Preparations. 
  For Pasechnik it was an opportunity to realise many of his 
most cherished ambitions in the fight against illness. His 
early research was promising; he felt he could produce a cure to 
some forms of cancer. Until then he had thought he would never 
have the resources to complete his work. Now he was being given 
the chance to develop one of the Soviet Union's most advanced 
laboratories in biotechnology. He accepted. 
  The fact that the offer came from the Ministry of Defence 
did 
not worry him unduly. In the Soviet Union, the military was the 
engine of most scientific research; it had the cash and the 
people to run it. Even if a scientific project had a strictly 
civilian application, the military was still in charge. It was 
the Soviet way. 
  From 1974 to 1981, Pasechnik built up his special 
laboratory, 
scouring the country until he had 400 people on his staff, a 
lavish budget and enough hard currency to give his scientists 
constant access to the latest biotechnological advances in the 
West. The laboratory began its work in 1981. Over the next two 
years Pasechnik realised the truth: far from being the heart of 
a new civilian research operation, he was at the centre of a 
vast network of factories and laboratories working on deadly new 
weapons of war. 
  "Officially we were involved in vaccine development and in 
producing preparations for protecting crops," said Pasechnik. 
"In fact, we were developing methods of production and 
equipment for a huge biological warfare programme." 
  To begin with, Pasechnik had little idea of the scale of the 
operation. Only later did he discover that, as well as his 
laboratory in Leningrad, there were two more in Moscow, two just 
outside it and one in Novosibirsk, all working on the same 
project. Five manufacturing plants employing 15,000 people were 
operating in other parts of the country. The operation, known 
as Biopreparat, had a budget of 200m roubles and tens of 
millions of American dollars a year. It was one of the best 
kept secrets of the cold war. 
  Its task was to develop new strains of diseases, more 
powerful than anything known to science and to produce them in 
aerosol form. The germ also had to be resistant to antibiotics 
available to the Nato armies of the West. The specific job 
allocated to Pasechnik's laboratory staff was to make them 
effective weapons of war: they had to find ways of delivering 
the germs by artillery shell, bomb or missile, to ensure that 
they had a long life in the open air and that they could be 
dispersed over a wide area. 
  The breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institute of 
applied microbiology at Obolensk, 60 miles south of Moscow. 
There, with the help of work done at Pasechnik's laboratory, 
scientists developed their first super-plague: a new strain of 
tularaemia. A severe infectious bacterial disease of man and 
domestic animals, carried by contact or insect bite, it is named 
after Tulare, California, where it was discovered. The tests on 
it were sufficiently encouraging for Moscow to give permission 
for full- scale development and production. 
  Two years later, the scientists at Obolensk were asked to 
develop an even more deadly germ based on pneumonic plague, 
another airborne infection. Pasechnik's job was to refine the 
production processes to make the operation more efficient. As a 
result, by 1987 the Soviet Union had sufficient industrial 
capacity to manufacture 200 kilos of the super-plagues every 
week, enough to kill up to 500,000 people. 
  The super-plague germ was, of course, never manufactured on 
this scale. The germ had a short life and only enough was made 
for testing. But the Biopreparat network stood on standby, 
ready to begin fullscale production when instructed, at a time 
in the future that was designated Day X. 
  Here then was a programme for producing the most devastating 
genetically engineered weapons ever seen, just waiting to be 
given the go-ahead. Tiny quantities of the Russian super-plague 
could devastate any city in the West, killing millions while 
leaving buildings, factories and raw materials intact. They 
would be the perfect designer weapon. 
  At the Soviet defence ministry, high-ranking generals were 
fully aware of this biological capability and built it into 
their military planning. Known as the Weapons of Special 
Designation, they would be used not only as a last resort but as 
support weapons in a conventional non-nuclear conflict, to 
attack the enemy's troop reserves and hamper his operations at 
ports and rail centres. 
  Every part of this programme was in breach of the 1972 
Biological and Toxin Warfare Convention, an international 
agreement which the Soviet Union had signed. It was also 
against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been 
proclaimed by Mikhail Gorbachev. 
For Pasechnik, the Gorbachev era was a chance to try to change 
the direction of the programme at his laboratory. In late 1985 
he pressured senior officials in Biopreparat to let him switch 
some of his research effort to the civilian purposes for which 
it had ostensibly been established. He got nowhere. 
  "I was told many times just to get on with my work and stay 
in my place," he said. Pasechnik did just that. By 1988, he 
had risen to a rank equivalent to that of major-general and was 
in charge of two manufacturing plants and three research 
laboratories. Two of these were working on biological weapons; 
the third was given to him to placate his desire to do civil 
work -- and also as a cover for the biological warfare research. 
  But Pasechnik was increasingly uneasy. He had no idea that 
his work was in breach of the 1972 treaty; he did not know such 
a treaty existed. But he felt that the weapons he was helping 
to develop were an abuse of his scientific skills -- and 
demonstrated hypocrisy in the Russian military command about the 
Gorbachev revolution. Above all, he felt passionately that 
genetically engineered biological weapons were a crime against 
humanity. 
  In late 1988, he began to think about defecting. Despite his 
long and illustrious scientific career, Pasechnik had never been 
allowed to travel outside the Soviet bloc. Then, in the summer 
of 1989, Biopreparat began negotiations with a factory in 
Toulouse, France, which manufactures equipment for chemical 
laboratories. Pasechnik volunteered to go to finalise the deal. 
As a reward for his overall performance, permission was granted. 
  He arrived in France at the beginning of October. He had 
thought carefully about how to escape the KGB watchers who 
travelled with his group. One morning he telephoned the British 
embassy in Paris and in a brief conversation with a surprised 
diplomat announced himself, his position and his wish to defect. 
  The news of his offer reached the Secret Intelligence 
Service 
(SIS, otherwise known as MI6) in London at a critical time. For 
the previous five years, SIS, the American CIA and a number of 
Nato military intelligence organisations had been trying to 
piece together the snippets of information they had about the 
Soviet biological warfare programme. 
  In May 1979, American intelligence had heard reports of an 
explosion at a secret Soviet research facility on the outskirts 
of Sverdlovsk, 850 miles east of Moscow. A leak of anthrax had 
killed up to a hundred people; an area three miles downwind of 
the factory had been contaminated. The Russians had tried to 
contain the damage with a widespread immunisation programme but 
it had proved largely useless. 
  Throughout the 1980's, the leak had been raised by both 
British and American officials with their Soviet counterparts. 
But the official line remained the same: that a handful of 
people had died in the city after eating contaminated meat 
bought on the black market. There was no biological weapons 
programme. 
  Snippets of information from sources in the Soviet Union 
suggested otherwise. Satellite pictures showed plants and 
testing sites apparently configured for the manufacture of 
biological weapons. The DIA (the Defence Intelligence Agency, 
the Pentagon's spies) estimated that the Russians had up to 
eight sites for developing and storing biological weapons. SIS 
largely concurred with that view, and a series of reports were 
circulated to intelligence chiefs and British ministers, warning 
that the Soviet biological programme had not slowed down as a 
result of the Gorbachev reforms. 
  As frequently happens when intelligence is fragmentary, the 
politicians refused to hear the message. At the time, all 
Western governments had been seduced by Gorbachev's reforms. 
The cold war was thawing and no prime minister or president was 
prepared to risk a confrontation with the Soviet Union that 
might change the delicate balance of international relations. 
At the same time, there was a sense that Gorbachev was an 
honourable man who would not allow anything as terrible as 
biological weapons to be developed while he was president. The 
intelligence warnings were ignored. 
  When the SIS station chief in Paris flashed the message to 
London about the would-be defector in Toulouse, it caused 
considerable excitement. At last, here was proof that would 
satisfy even the most sceptical politician. Pasechnik was 
driven to Paris and caught a British Airways flight to Heathrow, 
travelling on false papers supplied by British intelligence. 
  As his feet touched British soil, Pasechnik burst into 
tears. 
The decision to leave his country and his family had placed a 
terrible strain on the defector. He had convinced himself that 
the work he had been doing was so terrible that he would 
probably face serious charges and perhaps prison in the West. 
It is a measure of his courage that, despite his fears, he 
stepped off the plane ready to tell all. As soon as he was 
settled in a safe house outside London he was reassured that he 
had found a new home and not a prison cell. 
  There was the normal nervousness in SIS about any defector: 
was he a plant? All the indications were that he was bona 
fide. He did not know how to drive, a clear sign that he was a 
member of the privileged elite in the Soviet Union; the distress 
he showed when he recounted the work he was doing was impossible 
to fake; then there was his love of Mozart sonatas, which he 
would listen to in the evenings after yet another dinner with 
his guardians. The SIS debriefers were quickly reassured. 
  He brought with him a wealth of new information. "It was 
stunning," said one of the debriefers. "A whole ministry 
exposed, billions of roubles spent, a complete organisation 
shown to be a front; then there was the clear involvement of 
Gorbachev, this friend of the West. It just went on and on." 
In July 1992, the British and American governments demanded 
from the Russians a list of all their biological weapons 
research, production and storage sites and access to them. Two 
months later, Russia agreed to allow a full inspection but 
failed to admit the existence of all of their sites. There the 
matter stands. Since then verification has proved almost 
impossible. 
  To reinforce Western concerns the CIA brought out a defector 
from the Biopreparat programme in late 1992. He confirmed 
Pasechnik's story, and added to Western suspicions that, while 
Yeltsin was claiming the programme had stopped, the research and 
development of new strains of genetically-engineered 
superweapons were continuing apace. When President Bill Clinton 
and Yeltsin met in Vancouver less than a year ago, biological 
warfare was on the agenda. Once again, Yeltsin assured the 
American president that all work had stopped. This time, 
Yeltsin was so convincing that even some of the most cynical in 
the intelligence community were inclined to believe him. 
  Then, last autumn, another defector from the Biopreparat 
project came over to British intelligence to tell his debriefers 
what steps the Russian military had taken to keep the project 
going. 
  In every facility that had been opened for inspection to 
Western intelligence, the Russians had established convincing 
cover stories that made it appear as if each site had been 
converted to research or manufacture of vaccines. The secret 
work continued in parts of the sites that were never visited by 
the American or British officials. At the same time, a secret 
new facility was being built at Lakhta near St. Petersburg. Far 
from the Biopreparat biological warfare programme being shut 
down, it had undergone considerable modernisation. Work is 
continuing as before, in defiance of Yeltsin's orders. 
  If the story so far has not had a happy ending for Britain 
and America, the source of the information that exposed the 
programme has been more fortunade. 
  Today, Vladimir Pasechnik is happily settled in England. He 
has a job he loves working for a British company doing exactly 
the civilian research he wanted to do when he graduated. For 
him the disappointment is that his sacrifice in leaving the 
country he still talks about with a patriotic fondness has not 
stopped the programme he still considers to be a serious threat 
to humanity. 
  If this research is allowed to continue in defiance of the 
political leadership in Moscow, it makes a mockery of Russia's 
pretensions to be a democracy. It also raises serious questions 
about the future intentions of the Russian military, who have 
used political capital and scarce resources to continue a 
programme that remains a key part of their war plans.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 28 TASS -- Russia is neither developing 
nor producing biological weapons, a spokesman for the 
information and press department of the Defence Ministry told 
ITAR-TASS today, following reports in a number of foreign and 
Russian mass media organs, which maintain that Russia is 
allegedly continuing to implement a programme of creating 
biological weapons, specifically new "super-plague", to which 
the West has no antidote. 
  The foreign mass media quote reports of an anonymous 
intelligence source, which maintains that the programme is being 
implemented under the control of the Russian Defence Ministry. 
  In the opinion of experts from the Defence Ministry, it is 
rather astonishing that the forgery, circulated in the West in 
search of a sensation, was thoughtlessly repeated by some 
Russian mass media organs, which had ample opportunity to 
contact specialists and check the correctness of the reports.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 2020 GMT on 24 March carried a two-minute video 
report by A. Peslyak in the "Vesti" newscast on Russia's 
destruction of its chemical weapons. 
  Peslyak began by recapping Russia's international commitment 
to destroy its chemical weapons and to discontinue their 
production. Archive footage was shown of the international 
convention on the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  He then reported on the debate on this topic in the State 
Duma on 24 March. Peslyak said that the main problem was 
storage of the weapons until they could be destroyed. The video 
showed the Duma being addressed by Major General Yuriy 
Tarasevich, deputy head of the chemical defense troops of the 
Russian Federation, who said: "You must understand that we 
cannot do anything about the storage areas themselves. 
Therefore we are saying at the present time that the most 
dangerous situation has arisen in these two arsenals we have. 
That's in (Kompapino) and especially in Gornyy, Saratov Oblast." 
  Peslyak said that the Defense Ministry was asking for half a 
billion dollars to finance the destruction of the weapons. The 
video then showed an excerpt of an interview with V. Nikonov, 
deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International 
Affairs, identified by caption, who said: 
  "The means of eliminating the chemical weapons has yet to be 
decided upon. The sites where the destruction of the chemical 
weapons is to take place have yet to be chosen. As you can see 
from the hearing, the settling of these matters with local 
authorities and, moreover, with local inhabitants is running 
into considerable difficulties." 
  Peslyak then pointed out that a factory in Chapayevsk 
equipped with ultra-modern technology was standing idle when it 
could be used for destroying chemical weapons. Video showed the 
exterior and interior of a factory, with its machinery wrapped 
in plastic sheeting. No one was taking responsibility for this, 
he said. He also said that it was difficult to know just how 
much toxic material there was to be destroyed saying there could 
be "40,000, 80,000 or 400,000 tonnes." 
  In addition to the factory, the video showed personnel in 
protective clothing working with munitions in the open, and rows 
of charred shells. An assortment of gas masks was also shown.

  [Text] An attempt is being made to resolve the issue of the 
elimination of chemical weapons behind the scenes without public 
debate, scientist Vil Mirzayanov declared in an interview with 
Interfax. 
  He said every effort should be made to keep the Duma from 
ratifying a treaty on chemical weapons destruction. 
  He said that "since Russia does not have an environmentally 
safe technology for chemical destruction, the period of chemical 
weapons scrapping should be prolonged from 10 years, as is 
envisaged in the treaty, to 25-30 years." 
  He called for an early debate on the issue with the leaders 
of parliamentary factions from Russia's Choice Party, Russian 
Unity and Concord Party, Yavlinsky's Association, Communist 
Party, and Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Mirzayanov argued that the proposed technology of burning 
chemical weapons could not guarantee safety and explained that 
this method provided for burning toxins in special hermetically 
sealed chambers and for filtering the resulting gasses. 
  "But here the question arises as what to do with the 
filters, 
which absorb poisonous pollutants", Mirzayanov said. Besides, 
in his words, nothing guarantees that through the filters 
chemical weapon components could not pollute the atmosphere. 
  He urged the Duma to sanction a chemical weapons inventory. 
In his words, "a weapon that has been buried is as dangerous as 
a weapon planned to be sealed." Mirzayanov noted that 
"pollutants have not only instantaneous but also delayed impact 
on people." 
  He predicted adverse effects for the next generation and 
said 
that "gradual but damaging changes are taking place in humans."

<F P=106> [Article by Vil Mirzayanov: "In Jail There Is `Neither Jew </F>
Nor Greek'" 
  [Text] I have experienced many pangs of conscience. As I 
worked on chemical weapons I could not help but realize for what 
purpose they were being made. Just as I realized that by 
breaking my silence I would end up in jail sooner or later. 
  A few days ago I came back after spending 27 days in 
custody. 
There I realized that it is not just the "chemical generals" who 
are willing to go to any length to settle scores with those who 
would spoil their comfortable and peaceful lives under the veil 
of secrecy. The same kind of "generals" are to be found in the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the procuracy and the courts. Some 
of them poison bodies and some of them poison souls, and it is 
hard to say which is worse. In a word, politics is poisoned. 
  But the generals are not the only problem. We have become 
too 
accustomed to slavery to behave like free people. When released, 
former prisoners often attempt to forget the nightmare of 
degradation that they have experienced -- it no longer concerns 
them! But to forget is to condone the tyranny that is now being 
imposed on others. 
  Until recently my images of prison and prisoners were 
derived 
solely from movies. I thought that criminals and their behavior 
were a terrible world inaccessible to us. And, as an ordinary 
individual, I was actually glad that I did not understand it. 
  The initial holding cell at Matrosskaya Tishina is 
legendary. 
It is the waiting room of hell. Dirty, worn walls and slovenly 
guards. A 16-square-meter box into which 50 people are crammed, 
going for almost 24 hours at a stretch without sleep, food or 
water. The very first morning proved just how little the life of 
a prisoner is worth, a prisoner whose guilt might never even be 
proven. A drunk guard brutally beat a Kurd who was trying to ask 
for something. "You scumbags," he screamed, "you bandits -- I'll 
destroy anybody who talks back to me!" Then a few more hours of 
humiliation: photographs, fingerprints and, finally, one's "own" 
cell: four iron bunks and three mattresses for seven people. 
When the doors slammed shut behind me I inwardly cringed, 
expecting a continuation of the mockery. But the first thing I 
heard was: "Sit down! Do you want some tea?" They saw that I had 
brought nothing with me and offered me some food. Simple human 
gestures... 
  This may shock some people, but in our inside-out world, in 
a 
world poisoned by politicians, prison is genuinely fair. People 
will share the only thing they own with you without expecting 
anything in return. There is no hypocrisy and no lies. Over 
there is a murderer, and I am a political prisoner -- yet we are 
the same. I am respected for my mind, not for my past 
achievements. You are perceived for what you are. In everyday 
life -- I am a Tatar myself -- one can often hear people used 
words like "chuchmek" [derogatory term for person of Central 
Asian origin] or "natsmen," [ethnic minority] and as for calling 
a Jew a "Yid"... In prison there is neither Greek nor Jew, and 
ethnic hatred does not exist as a concept. I saw people help a 
Vietnamese man. He could not understand a thing -- and people 
explained things to him, interpreted for him, showed him... But 
look at how foreigners are viewed in Moscow -- "as if we didn't 
have enough criminals of our own." The newspapers print it, 
television broadcasts it and the Moscow government takes 
measures to eradicate crime "by persons from the Caucasus 
region." But in prison there is none of this. 
  I was told: do not worry, in prison no one will ever lay a 
hand on you. Anyone who breaks the truce faces complete 
ostracism, because for the slightest infraction they drag out 
everyone, beat them up and throw them in solitary. Anyone who 
causes a row is not just putting himself at risk. 
  In order to survive there you must become an optimist. In 
the 
larger cells, where there are 100 or more prisoners instead of 
just 25, there are "families" of 5-7 individuals. They share 
everything they get from outside. Those who get no packages do 
the dirty jobs and get a piece of sugar -- the common currency 
here -- from each of the others. 
  One cellmate of mine in Cell 238 was a businessman who sells 
woodworking equipment. He was just driving along, at a roadblock 
they found a pistol in his car -- and now he is doing four 
months' time. That is not much. A driver from Sheremetevo used 
to take whatever he found lying around. One prisoner is a 
pickpocket, another is in prison for petty theft, and yet 
another is there for brawling. None of them likes the Duma or 
Zhirinovskiy. "He," they say, "is a fascist, just like our 
prison guards." 
  In prison I realized that human rights are just as important 
a struggle as the fight against chemical weapons. Many people 
have been in prison for three or four years without a trial. The 
chairman of Tellur Cooperative is in his fifth year in prison 
for "embezzlement of socialist property": he used a short-term 
loan to buy computers instead of food items. Yet the law states 
that no one may be held longer than two months without trial. 
Our constitution and laws, imperfect though they may be, are our 
only protection against those who have the power. Even in prison 
you have rights and obligations under the Investigative 
Detention Center Charter. But you will not be allowed to look at 
that charter -- it is "for official use only." Yet as long as it 
applies only to the prison guards, every one of us is in danger. 
  My former colleagues are still afraid to speak up, both 
those 
who work for the defense industry and those who are already 
retired. It has been almost a year and a half since I came out 
publicly, but still I am the only one. Whether they will put me 
in jail again (going to jail is one of those things that are out 
of my hands) will depend on the new general procurator. I hope 
that things will be easier for those who come after me...

<F P=106> [Interview with Vil Sultanovich Mirzayanov, conducted by </F>
Leonard Nikishin and Leonid Sharov: "Vil Mirzayanov: Getting To 
Know Prison Brings You Closer to the Truth"] 
  [Text] OBSHCHAYA GAZETA covered the case of scientist 
Vil Mirzayanov in a recent issue in connection with the 
impermissibility of using overt blackmail, even if it is 
"justified," in order to achieve justice. Vil Sultanovich is now 
free. But justice has not been achieved. He agreed to meet with 
our correspondent precisely because he is well aware of the 
nature of the problem that presents itself: the correlation 
between human rights, the law and power... 
  Correspondent: Vil Sultanovich, officially your 
case has not yet been closed, even though our judicial system 
has, one must assume, expended quite a lot of effort on it. So, 
like it or not, part of this interview will have to be devoted 
to your impressions acquired in investigative offices, in court 
and in prison cells. 
  Mirzayanov: Odd as it may seem, I turned out to be 
more prescient than my lawyer, Aleksandr Asnis. He believed that 
the court would in the end find the strength to be objective and 
unbiased. From Asnis' point of view, the court had every 
opportunity to deal with the case fairly quickly. Under those 
conditions we had a right to expect an acquittal. 
Unfortunately... People in the know warned me that once the 
investigation took a clear turn in favor of indictment nothing 
good could be expected to come of it. But I still had hopes that 
my case would reach the General Procuracy -- and there fall 
apart, because even a blind man could see that it was completely 
contrived. Nothing of the kind ever occurred. But then I came to 
realize that justice cannot be expected from the courts. That 
the KGB and the courts are the same in nature. That is my main 
impression or lesson from all this. I no longer have any 
illusions. About the fact that our institutions and official 
agencies have become accustomed to doing shoddy work and being 
paid big salaries for that shoddy work, just like in the courts 
and the procuracy... They are one and the same. And that despite 
the fact that what is at stake here are human beings' lives and 
futures. Pity our people! Nothing has changed in this country. 
We are all still in the hands of an inhuman regime. That is not 
just an impression or a lesson -- it is a conclusion. 
  Correspondent: How did the investigation go? We at 
least have some impression of the trial... 
  Mirzayanov: As I understood, it proceeded in the 
usual fashion. That is to say, it involved a tremendous number 
of violations. That is to say, just the way the investigator 
wanted it, and the way those who gave him his orders wanted it. 
My petitions were not granted even though they concerned 
fundamental issues like getting expert opinions from more 
competent and qualified experts. Oh, no -- why should they do 
anything to help out the one being investigated? You ask that an 
important witness be called, and they refuse. All terribly 
cynical. Quite frankly, there is no way that what went on can be 
called an investigation, i.e. a procedure with some connection 
to the law. 
  Correspondent: Was your lawyer allowed to be 
present at the preliminary investigation? 
  Mirzayanov: I had no lawyer at all until 11 
November 1992. The people involved in the October events in 
Moscow got lawyers instantly, as if they were just waiting until 
they were needed. When I was in Lefortovo (my first jail time at 
the start of the trial) the KGB persistently attempted to "set 
me up" with one of their lawyers. I repeatedly refused. On 2 
November I was released on the condition that I not travel. It 
was only on 11 November that Aleksandr Asnis, who was chosen by 
me, began to work with me, and the KGB only allowed him access 
to the case with tremendous reluctance and after persistent 
requests by the deputy general procurator. 
  Correspondent: Did anything change after the 
investigation? 
  Mirzayanov: And how! The most important thing: the 
lists of information containing state secrets. They were not 
even included in the case file! 
  Correspondent: Excuse me for going back to an 
unpleasant subject, but our justice system plunged you (their 
term, incidentally) into prison life. Why do you think that was 
done? 
  Mirzayanov: Out of habit, I believe. Many people, 
very many, are "plunged," as you put it, into that. Either as a 
show of force, or to demean them. Either answer fits. But I have 
various impressions of prison. Yes, the filth is incredible and 
there are rats in the corridors, drunken guards and beatings. 
People stay in jail for three or four years without coming to 
trial. Some cells hold 100 people, four times more than their 
normal capacity. I remember that I spent my first days in jail 
in a box that measured 16 square meters, and there were 50 of us 
in there. We were given nothing to eat or drink. The lowliest 
farm animals are better treated. You cannot actually eat the 
stuff they do serve in prison. And the prison talk... And the 
shock at what you are seeing and hearing, at the fact that you 
are standing right next to a murderer. Or at finding out that 
there are prisoners among you who were sent there for 
psychiatric evaluation. But then I got lucky. The women had me 
transferred from the holding cell to a "luxury" cell with just 
four cots in it. But even there we had to sleep in shifts. I was 
the seventh prisoner in the cell. Incidentally, sleeping in 
shifts is something that has to be learned. I didn't get it 
right away. But, generally speaking, people in prison are 
ordinary people. They do not divide themselves up into the 
guilty and the innocent. They are friendly. They are willing to 
help you out, though there are plenty who want to provoke you, 
too. People treated me normally, respectfully. People my age do 
not last long under those conditions. I was surrounded mainly by 
young men, under the age of 40. No one insulted me or made me 
get up and move when I sat down. And in my cell all the guys 
looked out for me, giving me tea and sugar... I remember the 
members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency. In 
Lefortovo I was right next to Lukyanov and Pavlov. They got fed, 
that's true! Their meals were brought in from a cafe. Even 
booze. Well, the other prisoners got supplied at the same time, 
anyway. As soon as they were released, the very same day, the 
usual prison food returned. They say the prison spent its whole 
five-year budget feeding the State Committee for the State of 
Emergency prisoners. 
  I would like to say that getting to know prison is not 
something that ennobles a person, but it does bring you closer 
to the truth. 
  Correspondent: Vil Sultanovich, tell us frankly: 
if it had not been for the noisy media campaign... 
  Mirzayanov: Yes, yes, you are right. Everything 
that happened after I was thrown into Matrosskaya Tishina was 
the result of the pressure brought to bear on state structures 
by the press and television. I also want to thank the public 
officials who came to my defense. But the whole horror of this 
is that it took the extraordinary efforts, energy and emotion of 
many people, it took a tremendous amount of righteous but, of 
course, extra-legal pressure just to put a single trial on a 
civilized footing. That could have been accomplished quite 
simply using law and logic. 
  Correspondent: Do you feel that the Paris 
International Convention on Chemical Disarmament signed in 1993 
is defective? After all, it makes no reference to binary 
weapons... 
  Mirzayanov: It is not just defective... I do not 
know how the Americans feel about it, but from a professional 
standpoint I find it completely oriented toward the past. It 
does not guarantee any sort of secure future. It not only does 
not ban binary weapons, it does not even ban any kind of 
research in that field. The Convention only requires that 
existing stocks of toxic agents be destroyed. 
  Correspondent: Binary weapons are particularly 
tricky due to the fact that their components are non-toxic 
chemical substances that are manufactured on an industrial scale 
for other purposes. And, of course, the "binary" formula in such 
cases is a closely-guarded secret. God forbid that such 
relatively simple technology spread around the world, finding 
its way into the hands of various dictatorial regimes. In your 
opinion, is it not necessary for Russia and the United States -- 
the two powers that currently have such weapons -- to begin 
developing joint measures to limit their proliferation? It would 
probably be necessary to exchange information on binary weapons 
and for both countries to pass a number of laws on this issue... 
  Mirzayanov: Definitely. Cooperation should occur 
in any form dictated by the current situation. If, of course, 
both sides really want to disarm chemically and not just get rid 
of some old junk. Unless there is that kind of cooperation, the 
USA and Russia simply will not be able to keep the peace. The 
ease with which binary weapons can be manufactured makes it 
possible for them to be obtained even by countries that are not 
technologically advanced, secretly and with impunity. That is a 
tremendous temptation. We must sound the alarm. It is for that 
reason that I attach great significance to this opportunity to 
speak via your newspaper, and I hope that the deputies of the 
State Duma will approach ratification of the Paris International 
Convention with great caution. 
  Correspondent: What do you personally intend to be 
doing in the near future? After all, you lost your job in 
January 1992 after your first statements to the press. As in the 
past, the system in the "new" Russia punishes dissidents harshly. 
  Mirzayanov: The issues I have raised are far from 
being resolved. An international ban on binary weapons, adoption 
of measures to prevent their proliferation and a ban on research 
in the field are all goals that will require a great deal of 
effort to attain. 
  After getting some personal experience with the terrible 
conditions under which prisoners are held at the Matrosskaya 
Tishina Investigative Detention Center, I cannot remain 
indifferent. Right now my name is somewhat well known, and I 
want to take advantage of that fact to campaign for improvement 
of prison conditions. 
  Correspondent: There is no doubt that your public 
activities will be beneficial. But how are you going to support 
yourself financially? 
  Mirzayanov: I will try to find work, and I will be 
asking anyone I can for a job. I could work as a consultant, an 
analyst or an experimenter -- I have had my doctor of sciences 
degree for almost ten years. But I would not shun any job. If I 
have to become a street vendor to support my family, then... 
  Correspondent: Did you receive any financial 
support during all your tribulations? I do not mean just moral 
support... 
  Mirzayanov: Of course. I was helped out by 
relatives, and friends, and public organizations. Particularly 
tangible aid came in the form of a prize from the Cavallo Fund 
in the United States; that helped me hang on for almost a year.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Lobacheva: "Chemical Weapons: Should They </F>
Be Stored, Detonated, or Converted by Reprocessing? If We Have 
to Think About These Questions for Long, We Shall No Longer Need 
an Answer"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Uglev did not publish any great 
secret about Russian binary chemical weapons, having decided 
that this kind of revelation is within the capability of a 
fifth-year student in any chemistry department and, therefore, 
it was not worth making a fuss over it. According to rumors, the 
President "reacted adequately to the unconstitutionality of the 
prosecution" against the scientist Vil Mirzayanov. It appears 
that his case will be closed. 
  No matter how you put it, it would be a blessing if 
only the mass media would quiet down again and not cause public 
opinion to pout over the news about how we are destroying 
poisonous substances that we have accumulated for many years. 
And how we are storing them, and how many are left. These 
military poisonous substances will be burned up, detonated, and 
sometimes simply and boldly dumped "on the ground" in 
secrecy. 
  Well, this cannot be allowed in any case. In general, nearly 
every disgraceful practice in connection with the production, 
storage, and destruction of chemical weapons occurred and is 
still occurring because we continue to live in an environment of 
total secrecy. A minimum of eleven million citizens of Russia 
carry this stigma of secrecy. Those who try to free themselves 
of this stigma are threatened with unpleasant consequences 
similar to those which befell Mirzayanov and Fedorov, and far 
from everyone is willing to risk getting a prison cot. 
  This is how my conversation began with Professor Sergey 
Novikov. Sergey Sergeyevich is director of a laboratory at the 
Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
and, in contrast to "chemical dissidents," never participated in 
developing chemical weapons. His scientific and technical 
experience consists of destroying highly toxic waste material 
resulting from production. For a long time, Novokov could not go 
abroad. Two years ago, however, it turned out that the secrets 
that he kept for many years are not so terrible after all, and 
the stamp of secrecy was removed. Now Novikov has not only a 
passport to go abroad, but is conducting a Russo-Swedish project 
called "The Destruction of Chemical Weapons in Russia: Problems 
and Perspectives," at the International Institute for Problems 
of Peace, located in Sweden. 
  You have to agree that it is somewhat strange that this kind 
of project has a Swedish residence, if one can express himself 
in this way. In our country, however, any serious and 
unclassified work of this nature is still practically 
impossible. All data are still being guarded by sharp-eyed 
departments of our security service. It is simply astounding. 
The USSR participated for nearly 20 years in preparing the 
Convention on Prohibiting the Development, Production, 
Accumulation, Use, and Abolishment of Chemical Weapons. We 
presented the world community with the most diverse possible 
data on their production and storage, and on possibilities of 
destroying the chemical potential that had been turned out by 
our country; also, the ecological impact of existing and future 
production on the environment and on people who worked with 
poisonous substances and who lived in polluted areas.... And 
what happened? The 1992 publication of the book by Kraus and 
Mellari, "Chemical Weapons in Soviet Military Doctrine," 
contains the same data that continue to be a great secret for 
all citizens of Russia, whether they are specialists in narrow 
fields, journalists, or residents of polluted areas. But a 
Swede, an American, or a German can easily look at this great 
secret of ours if he wants to buy the book in a store or request 
it from a library. Nothing changed after Russia signed the 
Convention in January 1993 either. Indeed, what is this legal 
suit against Mirzayanov? Is it not simply an unwillingness on 
the part of the "science security people" to forego their fairly 
well-organized and apparently well-paying personal lives? 
  Experts are generally amused about the charges leveled at 
Mirzayanov. And, really, one has only to analyze the list of 
those who received awards for developing chemical weapons and 
putting them into production -- a list published in the open 
press by Lev Fedorov. One does not have to be a Stirlitz to be 
able to match the names and positions of the heroes of the 
invisible front with the names of the enterprises, the cities in 
which they are located, the number of workers at these 
enterprises, the elapsed time after the discoveries had been 
made.... This is the intriguing picture that gradually 
emerges.... Who cares about Mirzayanov's "discoveries"? This is 
why all talk about exposing secrets is, at a minimum, naive: The 
chemical dissidents are absolutely right when they focus the 
attention of the world on the fact that the stores of chemical 
weapons that we have presented for destruction do not reflect 
the full picture. We are speaking about the disappearance of, 
God knows whereto, 75,000 tonnes of mustard gas and 14,000 
tonnes of Lewisite. Thus far there has been no mention, but with 
time information will certainly surface about chemical weapons 
-- ours and German -- that were buried in the Baltic Sea after 
World War II. After having signed the Convention, hiding 
something becomes problematical. After all, we have opened up 
our borders so that the responsibilities that we have accepted 
can be monitored. 
  And incidentally, this is not only for monitoring. We agreed 
that if there is any violation of any point of the Convention, 
severe sanctions can be applied against us. And this this 
already a serious matter. Whether there is a court case against 
Mirzayanov or not, an answer will still have to be given. Until 
the Convention is ratified, some kind of justification can be 
made, but that cannot go on forever. And here is where we come 
to the important point. 
  In accordance with the Convention, Russia has to begin 
destruction of its stores of chemical weapons in 1997 and finish 
this difficult task by 2005. Thus far, however, a state plan for 
the safe destruction of chemical weapons does not exist. There 
is a Committee for Convention Problems on Chemical and 
Biological Weapons. There is technology: One accepted and 35 
alternative methods for destruction. But there are no factories 
or plants. Not a single one! So how we are going to free 
ourselves of this scourge, and in such a short time to boot, is 
not entirely clear -- neither to you or us, nor to the experts. 
  A plant was being built in Chapayevsk especially for this 
purpose. It was proposed that a two-stage technology for 
destruction be applied here: First the poisonous substances 
would be subjected to a "wet" chemical detoxification and then, 
the resultant so-called reactive mass formed as a result of 
alkaline hydrolysis would be subjected to a burning process. 
Solid waste products were to be glazed and buried, and liquid 
waste would be used partly for repeated processing of subsequent 
poisonous substances, while fully detoxicated waste could 
already be poured into reservoirs because they would be rendered 
harmless. 
  Despite the fact that the description of this technology 
looks frightening and not too convincing, the developers 
maintain that the safety factor of this technology is very high, 
but as usual, there is no published data, and so it would be 
impossible to verify this assertion. Moreover, the Chapayevsk 
plant is now something totally different. In fact, it is now a 
training center and facility for training experts for the 
chemical troops. 
  This change of function took place after international 
experts had visited Chapayevsk and were to report to the world 
community that something had finally stirred the Soviet 
conscience, and they had devised a civilized method for 
destroying chemical weapons. The experts were satisfied that 
this was indeed the case and departed. Only at that moment did 
the city dwellers realize what kind of vile thing had been built 
next door to them. And they began picketing around the plant. 
Every pre-election program of Deputy candidates was based on 
promises to protect the residents of Chapayevsk who, for a 
period of many years now, had been poisoned by chemical 
products. It was already 1989 and it was impossible not to pay 
heed to the people's anger. And so the plant's profile was 
changed. 
  Anyway, plant capability was such that it would have taken 
400(!) years to destroy all the accumulated chemical trash, 
running at full capacity. So at first glance, it was not a great 
loss. But only at first glance. It was planned that after the 
plant had begun operating and after the necessary approvals, as 
many similar plants as necessary would be built. These plans are 
no longer valid, especially since in the past few years it has 
become clear that not a single mode of transportation available 
in our country could guarantee that chemical weapons could be 
transported safely to areas where plants might have been built. 
Now there is one way out: Similar enterprises can be built only 
next to storage areas, of which -- as is well known -- we have 
seven, and five of them are located in the greatly suffering 
Volga basin. From a common sense point of view, this is akin to 
madness. But in reality, there is no other way out. So we cannot 
be horrified and we cannot close our eyes to the consequences of 
militaristic philosophizing. We must immediately develop and 
implement a program of action. 
  Yes, we shall need immeasurably more resources than was 
proposed earlier. No one can force people to live and work in 
dangerous areas. But natives of cities where "chemistry" 
flourished, where they got used to drinking, eating, and 
breathing from poisonous sources, not receiving anything in 
return, should be offered a package of measures for their social 
protection, as well as compensation. Perhaps people will accept 
these provisions and will not leave. The ecological soundness of 
various technologies used for different purposes must be proven 
with absolute openness, with no omissions of any kind, and with 
the assistance of independent experts. Apparently there is no 
longer any talk about what was supposed to be operational in 
Chapayevsk. 
  The Americans are offering their technology already tested 
on 
Johnston Atoll and also, loans for this purpose. Of course, in 
this way they are resolving their own problems of distributing 
contracts and providing employment, but since time has run out, 
it is possible that this option will be selected. Monitoring and 
control (real ones!) will come very quickly and, again, will not 
be ours. America has already offered resources for the purchase 
of an information-analytical laboratory network, whose sensing 
elements will register "traces" of poisonous substances in 
working areas where the chemical weapons will be destroyed. In 
addition, it is essential for the public and the press to know 
that there is legislation which establishes the right of control 
over these sites. In other words, this problem can be resolved 
only if the public is fully informed about it. 
  The cost of destroying Russian chemical weapons is estimated 
at 10 billion dollars. Under our present economic conditions it 
appears unrealistic that this amount could be appropriated. The 
storage areas, however, are located in the most densely 
populated parts of the country, and any accident or sabotage or 
simply a worsening of storage conditions could lead to a 
catastrophe that would make Chernobyl look like a minor incident 
by comparison. 
  Is it possible that we are just going to wait until it all 
blows up and only then find the money, technology, and the 
people we need? Anyway, there may simply not be any people left: 
Chemical weapons are also frightening because there would be no 
one to save and no one to do the saving in polluted areas. I 
think it is time for our country to be returned to us, otherwise 
there will be no place left for us to live.

<F P=106> [Nicholas Bethell report: "Scientist Says Russians Still </F>
Defy Chemical Weapons Ban"] 
  [Text] Vil Mirzayanov, who became Russia's first 
post-Soviet political prisoner for revealing Russia's continuing 
chemical weapons programme, has spoken of "barbaric conditions" 
in the prison from which he was released last month. 
  Dr. Mirzayanov was told that the case against him, on 
charges 
carrying up to eight years in prison, has been dropped for lack 
of evidence. At his flat in Moscow he said: "I was called to 
the Ministry of Justice by Lev Baranov, the prosecutor in my 
case. It was a five-minute conversation. He apologised to me 
on behalf of A. N. Ilyushenko, Prosecutor-General of the Russian 
Federation. I told him that I would be taking the `new KGB' to 
court for the great moral and material damage they caused me 
these past 18 months." 
  Dr. Mirzayanov, 58, said that men were held at the 
Matrosskaya Tishina jail, sometimes for years, while their cases 
were investigated, with no visits permitted from friends or 
family. He described having to stand with 50 other prisoners, 
all naked because of the heat, in a cell infested with rats, 
cockroaches, bedbugs and lice, and so small that no one could 
lie down or sit. 
  Dr. Mirzayanov worked for more than 25 years in a large 
military chemical research institute on Enthusiasts' Avenue in 
Moscow. In 1990 he was one of the first to resign from the 
Communist Party to join the democratic movement. In October 
1992 he blew the whistle on his old firm, revealing that 
Russia's chemical warfare industry, despite the 1989 
Bush-Gorbachev agreement to destroy all chemical weapons and end 
production, was producing a new binary substance in Volgograd 
eight times more poisonous than anything possessed by the 
Americans. He was immediately arrested. 
  In early 1992, he said, field trials of the new gas were 
held 
on the Ustyurt plateau in what was by then the independent state 
of Uzbekistan, without the knowledge of President Karimov, the 
Uzbek leader. 
  "In other words, we pulled the wool over the Americans' eyes 
good and proper," he said. When the Americans found out later 
that year what was happening, they said nothing for fear of 
making Mr. Bush look foolish in the run-up to the presidential 
election. 
  Dr. Mirzayanov talked of past years in the Soviet military 
chemical establishment in Chapayevsk, where soldiers who were 
thought by the authorities to be of poor quality were put to 
work pouring lewisite, a deadly poisonous arsine derivative, 
from buckets and teapots into artillery shells. Many of them 
died. Then there was the great "white sea" accident when tons 
of poison were discharged into the Volga river, turning it white 
with the bellies of dead fish. 
  Russian scientists and generals, he says, continue their 
terrible work on chemical warfare even today. Accidents are 
frequent. They carry on working because it is the only trade 
they know and because chemical warfare has no possibility of 
"conversion" into peaceful work. 
  The Russian authorities have decided that the poisons to be 
destroyed under the Bush-Gorbachev agreement should be dealt 
with by those who made them. This is being done, he says, by 
burning the poisons in remote Russian localities, with 
disastrous results for the environment. 
  It is estimated by Dr. Mirzayanov that up to 50 per cent of 
those in Russian labour camps may be innocent of the charges on 
which they were convicted. He attributes his own escape from a 
long prison term to "pressure by Amnesty International, the 
European Parliament, the American Academy of Sciences and the 
Russian democratic movement". 
  Those who have no such friends are still wrongly convicted 
in 
large numbers. Aleksey Smirnov, the former Soviet dissident who 
is now chairman of the Centre for Human Rights in Moscow, said: 
"You must not imagine, just because the Soviet Union has gone, 
that Russia is now a country with monitors. We need observers. 
We need Western non-governmental organisations with staff and 
equipment. We need a civilised parliament. Then maybe we can 
make progress."

  [Text] The State Duma is preparing to consider the 
question of ratification of the 1993 Paris Convention on 
chemical disarmament. But should we be in a hurry with this when 
the military-chemical complex, "covered" by the directive of the 
Council of Ministers of 30 March 1993, has no intention of 
revealing its secrets, when the authors of the program for the 
destruction of chemical weapons are proceeding, as before, not 
from the interests of the people but from departmental 
self-interest, when "binary" weapons are not included in the 
convention at all? In this connection we are continuing to 
publish articles on the problem raised in issue No. 8 with the 
article "A Military-Chemical Romance." Today we are turning the 
floor over to an independent expert in this area, a scholar and 
a publicist, Lev Fedorov. 
  The stockpiles of chemical weapons are a heavy millstone 
hanging on Russia's neck. It is so impossible to lift that it is 
making us take a closer look and the military-chemical complex, 
with whose concerns we have been rewarded. 
<H5>  Work </H5>
  V-gas is the most poisonous toxic substance of the 20th 
century. It began to be produced industrially and loaded into 
ammunition in 1972 in shop No. 83 of an especially constructed 
production facility (today it is called the Chuvash Production 
Association Khimprom imeni Leninskiy Komsomol) in an especially 
built city -- a satellite of the capital of Chuvashia. This was 
done in Novocheboksarsk on three shifts for 15 long years while 
the American military were fighting with Congress, and they 
still did not receive permission for such an amusement. 
  Information about the extreme toxicity of V-gas was 
available 
by the time of the beginning of the planning and construction of 
the plant (just as was preliminary information about the 
long-term toxicity of small doses of this toxic substance) -- 
and it promised nothing good. All this required not only modern 
technology during production but also absolute safety during the 
shipment along the Cheboksary-Kanash railroad of hundreds of 
thousands of units of chemical munitions, each of which was to 
have been sufficient for all of Russia in case something 
happened. It was suggested that protective suits be worn while 
the work was being done -- a pardonable notion when discussing 
the anticipated landing on the moon. Women could not be enlisted 
for this work -- according to data from experimental production 
of V-gas in shop No. 22 at the old plant in Volgograd. In real 
life everything proceeded in purely Soviet style--they did not 
ensure that the equipment was sealed and on the real railroad 
they simply worried about saving money. They did not manage to 
make a protective suit (not for the moon; for Chuvashia) so they 
had to work in makeshift "protective" suits that had been 
permeated with all kinds of chemical agents. Women made up 
two-thirds of the collective of 1,000. I will not give the norm 
for the permissible content of V-gas in the work zone since I 
saw it in a letter that was stamped "secret" (with arguments why 
simple mortals are not supposed to know this). What is important 
is not the norm itself, which almost nobody ever adhered to, but 
the fact that, under the assumption that people were working in 
protective suits, our most humane leaders relaxed it 100-fold, 
and the patient residents of Chuvashia, who were breaking their 
backs to pay for their apartments and add a little to their 
earnings with the thirteenth wage, were not told this. 
  Thousands of people consider themselves to be victims, and 
they are insulted when they have to bow and scrape for the right 
to say they have an occupational disease or an occupational 
disability so that they can receive treatment without question 
and the benefits they have earned -- for example, the right to 
free medicine, food, and rest in a sanatorium. Let us not 
begrudge them these rights. Do reports on testing go from St. 
Petersburg only to Moscow, to the Defense Ministry, or do they 
also go to the Ministry of Health? 
<H5>  Tests </H5>
  There is a reluctance in all countries to publish data from 
tests of chemical agents and highly toxic substances in general. 
But few would doubt that testing toxic substances with the 
participation of human beings and even on human beings was a 
common thing for our army and industry, not to mention the NKVD 
[People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs]. In prewar years the 
practice of conducting tests directly on human beings involved 
thousands of people; there was testing of the blistering agents 
-- mustard gas and lewisite. During 1930-1935 in the Chemical 
Scientific Research Institute of the RKKA [Worker-Peasant Red 
Army] about 6,000 tests were done to study the effects of 
various toxic substances on human skin. This practice was 
suspended and then later resumed. 
  Many naval training sessions were conducted using toxic 
substances. During a training mission in the Baltic, in August 
1934, the destroyer Karl Marx was contaminated with mustard gas 
from an aircraft. At that time several Red Navy members were 
directly affected by the toxic substance -- cuts were made in 
their protective clothing at various parts of their body, so 
that everything was as it would be in a real chemical war. 
  The practice of testing toxic substances directly on humans 
continued into the postwar years. During the sixties the toxic 
properties of minute quantities of V-gas were studied this way. 
At the beginning of the eighties, in order to test samples of 
the latest toxic substance, they again singled out not only mice 
and rabbits but also military servicemen. And God save them if 
they were to blab about it. One of the officers involved in the 
experiment was kicked out of the army without a pension because 
of his big mouth, which was not documented until the end of 
1993. And were the tests of toxic substances conducted on human 
beings at the Central Scientific Research and Testing Institute 
of the Soviet Army in Shikhany supervised by its chief, General 
Anatoliy Kuntsevich -- now an academician, Hero of Socialist 
Labor, and Lenin Prize winner?

charge? 
<H5>  A Glance Back to Yesterday </H5>
  A book was published in the United States recently -- a 
survey of in-depth studies of the effects of mustard gas and 
lewisite on the health of veterans of many countries who in the 
past had participated in one way or another in operations 
involving chemical weapons. It includes data on the 1,097 
residents of the United States who during years before the war 
produced mustard gas at the Edgewood Arsenal, and about the 495 
residents of Japan who worked at a plant for producing mustard 
gas during 1929-1945, and about the 511 residents of Great 
Britain who worked on producing mustard gas during 1939-1945, 
etc. The only country for which information is not included is 
the Soviet Union. The USSR Ministry of Health was in charge of 
the health of producers of chemical weapons before the 1960's. 
Its sanitary-epidemiological administration was responsible for 
organizing protection of the workers' health before the 
beginning of the production of any toxic substance and during 
its production. It is now the State Committee on Sanitation and 
Epidemiological Oversight of the Russian Federation. 
  The Third Main Administration under the USSR Ministry of 
Health, which had been in charge of this since the end of the 
sixties, would have something to say about past damage to human 
health and to nature during the production of chemical weapons. 
Now it is called the Federal Administration for 
Medical-Biological Problems and Problems of Extreme Environments 
under the Ministry of Health of Russia. The only thing is that 
the society cannot get hold of the medical and ecological 
information accumulated here, which was gathered in connection 
with the production of subsequent generations of chemical 
weapons. And what about the laws--which are supposed to protect 
our right to this information, which cannot be secret? 
<H5>  Accidents and Disasters </H5>
  The chief of the radiation-chemical-biological (RKhB) 
forces, 
General Stanislav Petrov, says: "At enterprises for producing 
chemical weapons there was not a single case of discharging of 
toxic substance outside the work zones." But there were... 
  A special place among the documented accidents and disasters 
is occupied by the fire that broke out on 28 April 1974 in the 
V-gas production facility in Novocheboksarsk. According to 
information published only 18-19 years later (with fierce 
resistance from the leadership), its cause was a short in the 
electrical network related to incomplete construction work. 
During the fire aerial bombs filled with the "product" became 
unsealed and the latter got out of control. This is simply 
incredible: The incompleteness of the construction work 
manifested itself two years after the beginning series 
production of chemical munitions filled with V-gas, which is 
highly toxic and extremely dangerous to personnel. Information 
on the extent of the fire's impact on the life and health of the 
city's residents has not been made public yet. 
  There was another event at this production facility that has 
not yet been confirmed by anybody. About five years ago a 
container of V-gas burned there. They say that the toxic 
substance burned, but nobody will say how much of it. The 
discharges of toxic substance "outside the work zone" was 
obvious, but nobody will say how much of it moved over the city. 
The more so since it is all over. So was there a second fire or 
not? And will they tell us about other accidents without 
prompting? 
<H5>  Elimination </H5>
  A little about state secrets -- from the recollections of 
veterans and eyewitnesses. 
  At one time at the base for storing chemical weapons in the 
village of Maradykovskiy (Kirov Oblast) munitions containing the 
most potent phosphorus toxic substances were destroyed by 
submerging them in the swamps. 
  The chemical base in Chapayevsk at the beginning of the 
sixties stored mustard gas in containers (at least 1,200 tonnes) 
and lewisite in aerial bombs. By a decision from Moscow, the 
mustard gas was destroyed at the site but the lewisite was sunk 
in the northern seas. 
  At the chemical arsenal in the village of Gornyy (Saratov 
Oblast) at the end of the fifties mustard gas and lewisite were 
eliminated on a large scale on the basis of government 
decisions. Some of the chemical munitions were sent to be sunk 
in the Sea of Okhotsk. 
  The village of Kizner (Udmurtia) is linked to an accident 
that occurred at the beginning of 1993 at a railroad stage not 
far from the site of a large warehouse for storing both chemical 
and other munitions. 
  The stream of recollections is endless. Thousands of our 
compatriots -- former military chemists, military and civilian 
sailors -- participated in secret operations for burying, 
burning, and submerging Soviet chemical weapons (the submersion, 
incidentally, they camouflaged as getting rid of captured German 
material). Yet there have been no official reports about this so 
far. 
  In order to get rid of toxic substances the Soviet Army 
submerged, buried, and burned them, practices now condemned and 
forbidden by the world community. Massive amounts of them were 
submerged in no less than 12 large areas of the seas that wash 
the shores of Russia. Massive amounts were buried at no less 
than 10 points in the former Soviet Union. 
  Legally and ecologically speaking, the "missing" chemical 
weapons still must be found and presented to Russian society, 
even if the munitions have been buried or submerged. The 
international community must also be informed about these 
weapons since, according to the International Convention on 
Chemical Disarmament, even munitions buried since 1976 and 
submerged since 1984 are still considered to be weapons. And 
ecologically speaking, any chemical weapon is dangerous, 
including those that have been buried or submerged in any year. 
  Yet at the military-chemical test site in Shikhany these 
weapons continue to be destroyed by the open explosion method. 
That was the case during the winter of 1992-1993 and the summer 
and autumn of 1993. So is the Army indifferent to all this? 
Including the Convention that was signed? 
<H5>  International Life </H5>
  In the interests of the immediate policy, during the winter 
of 1992-1993 leakage of information about the "possibility" of 
the spread of Soviet chemical weapons throughout the world was 
organized. But claiming that it was no longer crucial, the 
organizers of the "leakage" forgot to notify us of how things 
really were. 
  The military contacts of the "brothers forever" during the 
fifties, which ended with the USSR turning over to the PRC 
technological secrets regarding the production of nuclear and 
missile weapons, are no secret to anyone. Nothing has been 
reported yet about chemical weapons. The departments that hold 
this information -- the Russian Committee on the Chemical and 
Petrochemical Industry and the Defense Ministry of Russia -- are 
remaining silent. Can we wait for them? 
  The same thing pertains to the transfer to former socialist 
countries of chemical munitions to be owned or simply kept by 
them. Did that happen or not? 
  In their day the former GDR and Czechoslovakia did not 
conceal from anyone their aspiration to create territories free 
of chemical weapons on their lands. This is not consistent with 
Mikhail Gorbachev's statement in 1987 that the Soviet Union had 
never turned over and had never stored its chemical weapons in 
other countries, and as a confirmation of that he even cited 
data from "expert assessments." 
  The Defense Ministry remains silent -- no documents 
supporting one version or the other have been published. What is 
the matter? 
<H5>  Inventory </H5>
  At the beginning of October 1987 at the military-chemical 
test site in Shikhany the Soviet Union presented to the world 
community models of chemical munitions as though they were a 
part of the army's arsenal. To the question: "Have all the 
munitions available to be used by the army been shown here?" 
General Kuntsevich gave "an affirmative answer." Later, in a 
document sent to Geneva to the Conference on Chemical 
Disarmament, the same figures on the inventory of chemical 
munitions were confirmed. 
  What was presented to the world community? There were 19 
models of munitions containing toxic substances. Among them, 
along with the grenades filled with the "police" gas CS (they 
were the ones put to use in Tbilisi), there were four kinds of 
munitions filled with toxic substances of the VX type from 
Chuvashia. They were included, however, only in the cannon and 
rocket artillery and also tactical missiles. In fact at that 
time there were many other kinds of chemical munitions available 
to the military. An accident in 1974 caused the existence of 
series-produced aerial bombs filled with V-gas to be revealed 
inadvertently. They were the ones, which were not included on 
the official list, that burned and exploded in the fire. In 
Novocheboksarsk several types of aerial bombs filled with V-gas 
were mass produced -- parachute, fragmentation, cassette, etc. 
On the whole, according to the recollections of workers, in 
Novocheboksarsk they used V-gas to fill not four but at least 14 
kinds of chemical munitions, and it was series production, on a 
conveyor, in large batches, 24 hours a day. 
  In January 1994 one of General Kuntsevich's assistants wrote 
in a newspaper that we have chemical weapons stored here in the 
Urals. It was surprising to read this confession if you consider 
that the Ural area has never been mentioned once before. And one 
could not but recall the discussion of the workers from 
Chuvashia concerning the fact that they produced two versions of 
rockets containing toxic substances -- with a single load of two 
tonnes of V-gas (they did not send a dispatch to Geneva about 
this) and one for multiple individually targetable reentry 
vehicles with toxic substances in each warhead. These missiles 
were apparently on combat alert in the Urals. I do not know 
whether or not this is actually true, but when I asked the 
experts what these multiple reentry tactical missiles were, I 
was justifiably embarrassed. It turns out that the warheads do 
not detach from the tactical missiles about which the letters to 
Geneva were written. They were called strategic. 
  In the autumn of 1993 General Kuntsevich wrote a thoughtful 
letter in one newspaper saying that it was time to report 
information about our chemical munitions to our partners in the 
negotiations. Perhaps it would have been easier not to lie? 
<H5>  Binary Weapons </H5>
  During 1954-1960 the United States Army began to develop the 
most sophisticated kind of chemical weapon -- binary. The 
subsequent policy for chemical weapons in the United States 
developed precisely in this direction. But since 1969 the United 
States has had no series production of chemical weapons -- 
neither binary nor traditional. Nonetheless our accusations 
against the Americans of producing components and even entire 
binary weapons continued until quite recently. The United States 
was even accused of beginning industrial production of binary 
weapons in 1987. As for the Soviet Union, in 1982 General 
Kuntsevich, at that time deputy chief of chemical forces of the 
Soviet Army, told the magazine SPIEGEL (not of his own accord, 
of course, but by a decision of the CPSU Central Committee) that 
the Soviet Union would not be responsible for the escalation of 
chemical weapons (he had in mind the "binary spiral"). In that 
same year of 1982 they began it, this very expansion. And during 
the five-year period the generals basically moved ahead. 
  General Ivan Yevstafyev 10 years later responded 
unequivocally to a question about the existence of binary 
weapons in the Soviet Union: "We have no stockpiles, but any 
country that has chemical production could have the potential 
for producing them." The statement from the new deputy chief of 
chemical forces that the Soviet Union "could" have it was never 
officially explained in any other way than by what followed from 
it -- the Soviet Union thought it had the right to create its 
own production potential for a chemical attack using binary 
weapons. At the present time the public has the following 
information on the efforts made to exercise this "right": the 
fact of the actual development of a domestic binary weapon and 
in two versions -- based on V-gas and based on a so-called "new 
toxic substance," the location of its possible production which 
makes it possible to conceal it from international control, the 
deceased developer, and, finally, the honoring of the generals 
in 1991 with bonuses for the creation of a binary weapon 
(Kuntsevich -- the Lenin Prize, and Yevstafyev -- the State 
Prize). And so the "right" has been exercised, and in 1989 
Foreign Affairs Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, speaking in the 
UN, announced that the USSR and the United States were prepared 
to make mutual commitments to halt the production of chemical 
weapons, including the binary types. There were still questions 
to be answered. No, not about how to stop doing something that 
was not being done. And not about national security, the 
understanding of which, it seems, does not originate in just any 
high-ranking military head. The question is a different one: It 
seems that the military-chemical complex "could" have, but did 
they ask us if we "should" have done all this. 
<H5>  Potential </H5>
  So, what do we have left now? 
  We used to have a potential for producing chemical weapons, 
whose maintenance turned out to be unnecessary under the 
conditions of disarmament, and at the end of the preparation of 
the Convention on Chemical Disarmament, this potential was 
destroyed--in Dzerzhinsk, Volgograd, and Chapayevsk. 
  But here in Novocheboksarsk everything having to do with the 
output of munitions with the latest V-gas has been preserved. 
And there has been no mention of a "balance of forces" -- the 
United States does not have such a potential; in principle since 
1969 the United States has been unable to produce chemical 
weapons at all and it cannot have a modern potential. The most 
probable reason for resistance of Russia's military-chemical 
complex is that it wants to maintain military-chemical 
superiority over its partners in the negotiations for as long as 
possible. 
  In order to mask the preservation of our potential, our 
military-chemical complex hints at "preserving trade secrets in 
the event that an inspection is conducted." 
  But this problem seems contrived. It cannot be ruled out 
that 
termination of the production of modern phosphorus toxic 
substances (and its inevitable "conversion" 
companions--phosphorus and chloride pesticides, whose commercial 
value is fairly questionable in our day) will completely 
eliminate the problem of "trade secrets" of these and 
accompanying processes. Moreover, the part of the experience of 
the Iran-Iraq war which involved Iraq's chemical aggression and 
the death of 3,500 peaceful residents of Iran shows that secrets 
of the production of toxic substances do not exist for that 
country. In any case the existence in Iraq of stockpiles of 
mustard gas, tabun, and sarin is no secret either to the chief 
of the radiation-biological-chemical forces, Petrov, or to the 
international community. 
<H5>  Are the People and the Army United? </H5>
  In the United States long before the beginning of the 
practical work the legislative groundwork was done, which 
provides for the ecologically comfortable existence of the 
population under the conditions of chemical disarmament. The 
laws that were adopted were multipurpose in nature -- they not 
only provided for ecologically safe destruction of chemical 
weapons but also protected the population from any other 
ecotoxicants generated by technology. 
  In 1984 the United States adopted a law which made it 
incumbent on the Pentagon to destroy the accumulated stockpiles 
of chemical weapons. Let us emphasize three points. The 
implementation of the decision was not made dependent on the 
"aggressive designs" of the USSR or Iraq -- the only imperative 
was the well-being of the population. Further, the military 
powers of the United States responsible for destroying the 
chemical weapons engaged for approximately 20 years in an 
intense dialogue with the population living near the eight 
storage bases on the continent before reaching an agreement that 
would allow them to start the work. Finally, it is the U.S. Army 
that financed alternative ecological studies near each storage 
facility where chemical weapons were to be destroyed and 
organized public hearings and meetings with the local residents 
and representatives of federal and local organs of power. 
  In the Soviet Union preparations for the agreed-upon 
destruction of chemical weapons were not begun until the end of 
the eighties. No legislative acts were adopted either before or 
after. 
  From the psychological standpoint the time that has passed 
since the declaration in 1987 of the termination of the 
production of chemical weapons has been spent in vain -- the 
attitude of the authorities toward the population has not 
changed. The chairman of the Committee on Conventional Problems 
of Chemical and Biological Warfare under the president of the 
Russian Federation, General Kuntsevich, once noted that 
"Russia's authority in the national arena depends on the 
population's readiness to cooperate" with the committee. This is 
a purely Soviet mistake. The representative of the authorities, 
unconsciously associating himself with Russia, is forgetting 
about the bilateral nature of any interaction. Legal entities 
and individuals (the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, 
the military-industrial complex, the Ministry of the Chemical 
Industry, General Kuntsevich) never intended to take the 
interests of the population into account and, well, the 
population had the corresponding attitude toward them 
  The first alarm went off in 1989 in Chapayevsk where, by a 
decision of the military-industrial complex and the Politburo of 
the CPSU Central Committee, a secret facility began to be 
constructed in 1986. When the population learned from Eduard 
Shevardnadze's speech, delivered in a remote foreign city, that 
chemical weapons which they thought would be taken far away were 
to be destroyed at the facility that was located 12 kilometers 
from the city, there was a social explosion. 
  The residents demanded the information from an ecological 
expert appraisal and...they did not receive it. They formulated 
their own requirements for the plan based on its obvious 
shortcomings and...they were not deemed worthy of any answer. In 
general the government saw the merit of announcing that the 
facility would be mothballed and refraining from destroying 
chemical weapons there. 
  Subsequently there were many reproaches, particularly 
against 
the intractable population. But the reason is plain to see. As 
usual, they bossed the people around and lied to them. And it is 
quite surprising that it never occurred to anybody to apologize 
to the people for the hell of the past years related to the 
production of mustard gas and lewisite. In any case, the bigwigs 
who came to Chapayevsk in 1989, including the establishment of 
the military-chemical complex, made it their first order of 
business to go to the club to persuade the population not to 
protest and not to the cemetery to place wreathes on the graves 
of their mothers and fathers who died during the war and the 
first years after the war because of participating in the 
production of mustard gas and lewisite. 
  The discussion by the authorities in the autumn of 1992, 
when 
residents of Chuvashia were told about the construction in 
Novocheboksarsk of the main facility for destroying phosphorous 
toxic substances, planned by a decision of the 
military-industrial complex, did not begin with an accounting 
for the past either. There had been no chemical weapons in this 
republic for a long time and they intended to bring them in from 
far away, particularly from the city of Shuchye in Kurgan Oblast 
(across eight or nine regions). The final stage of the shipment 
was the Kanash-Cheboksary section, on which, I recall, at one 
time they saved money when chemical weapons first began to be 
produced. Again there were no apologies for the past nor any 
suggestions about paying for it. Again there was no ecological 
expert appraisal (the Ministry of Ecology okayed the plan 
without considering it). Again there was a conspiracy on the 
part of the authorities behind the backs of the residents of 
Chuvashia. And again social resistance that ended with the 
destruction of the idea. 
  When will they start talking to the population while taking 
their interests into account? 
<H5>  Secrecy </H5>
  The surge of publicity after Chernobyl, which broke open the 
floodgates of the nuclear branch, bypassed military chemists, to 
their great elation. It was simply that they had not yet had 
such a large scale disaster, which, incidentally, did not make 
things any easier for society. 
  Last summer in Novocheboksarsk the local state security 
caught a Moscow Greenpeace member outside Khimprom. And recently 
a camera crew from NTV was not allowed on its grounds (right 
after some rich uncles from the Japanese Asaki had visited there 
without any trouble). This is one more indicator of the 
psychological unpreparedness of our authorities for anything at 
all. But the greatest evidence is their unwillingness to begin 
the process of declassification of old papers that are doing 
nobody any good. 
  One can give at least three reasons for the slowness in 
declassifying information about chemical weapons of the Soviet 
Union. 
  In the first place, Russia's withdrawal from the chemical 
standoff after signing the International Convention on Chemical 
Disarmament (January, 1993) leaves no room for any 
military-chemical secrets. Today they are especially protecting 
the dirty "secrets" related to direct violations of the law and 
human rights, and up to this day in this sphere there are 
special courts, special procurators, special advocates, etc. It 
is necessary to purge such secrets because this will give Russia 
confidence and respect from the world community. 
  Second, the existence of the law banning secrecy of 
absolutely all ecological and medical information regardless of 
its present "secret keeper," unfortunately, is too multifaceted. 
  Third, the appearance in 1993 of the law on state secrets, 
which makes it possible to maintain secrecy only with respect to 
documents from 1964-1993, if there is a need for it, that is, if 
they contain state (in this case, defense) secrets, and not 
departmental secrets that nobody needs. 
  As we can see, even the present imperfect legal base 
requires 
concessions from the military-chemical complex. In order to make 
my point I will give not only the basic composition of the 
chemical branch of the military-industrial complex but also its 
"reservists" -- the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation 
(represented by its numerous "mini-ministries" -- 
radiation-chemical-biological forces, the Navy, the Air Force, 
the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate, the 
military-ecological administrations of the general staff, etc.), 
Roskomkhimnefteprom, the Federal Administration of 
Medical-Biological Problems and Problems of Extreme Environment 
under the Ministry of Health and the Medical Industry of Russia 
(and in general all of the Ministry of Health and the Medical 
Industry), the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Ministry 
of Agriculture, the Agrokhim Association, the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations, and many other ministries and 
departments. The beginning of the disclosure of information 
could provide a start for preparing a program for surmounting 
the ecological and medical consequences of past preparations for 
chemical war. Without declassification this is impossible in 
principle, just as it is impossible in principle to promptly 
destroy stockpiles of chemical weapons, regardless of how much 
our foreign partners may insist upon it. The population will not 
allow it. 
  So what are we waiting for, gentlemen? 
<H5>  Advantage </H5>
  Everything would seem to be clear regarding the advantage to 
the state. 
  There are also more mercantile aspects. Initially the 
residents of the Soviet Union in general were not kept abreast 
of the possible costs. During the era of "chemical glasnost" in 
the press they tried to promote two notions: false "incomes" 
from chemical disarmament ("the destruction of chemical weapons 
could make Russia richer") and the "participation" of the United 
States in covering Russia's costs ("the Americans will pay for 
the destruction of chemical weapons in Russia"). 
  As soon as there began to appear a possibility of obtaining 
from the state allocations for future advantage (this was in 
1991-1992) many individuals holding legal positions decided to 
venture into commerce. Here are just a couple of examples. 
During the brief existence of the joint-stock Scientific 
Production Association Kristall, General Kuntsevich decided to 
participate in its work (as the chief of the Center for 
Ecotoximetry under the Chemical Physics Institute imeni N.N. 
Semenov of the Russian Academy of Sciences), as did General 
Yevstafyev (from the Military-Chemical Institute with the 
designation Military Union 64518) and the director of the State 
Union Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and 
Technology, Vladimir Petrunin (Ministry of the Chemical 
Industry). Within the framework of Arsin, a joint-stock company 
of the closed type, the chief of the military Central Scientific 
Research and Testing Institute in Shikhany, Danilkin, and the 
director of the Volsk branch of the State Union Scientific 
Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology, 
Kochergin, tested their strength. The chiefs of the chemical 
forces (the former one, Pikalov, and the present one, Petrov) 
could not resist the temptation to participate either. The acted 
on behalf of the Association for Business Cooperation with 
Foreign Countries in the area of the utilization and protection 
from the effects of dangerous substances and materials, and the 
omnipresent General Kuntsevich gave them a recommendation as 
well. No traces of this commercial activity remain. 
  At the basis of all the activity lay a seriously discussed 
economic advantage that was expected to be derived from 
transforming lewisite into especially pure arsenic for 
radioelectronics: From 6,000 tonnes of lewisite it was possible 
to obtain 2,000 tonnes of arsenic. There are even computations 
that take into account the future gain from the sale of arsenic 
at world prices: The price of one kilogram of metallic arsenic 
is from $3,000 to $5,000. But these plans could be left hanging 
in air if it suddenly turned out that the world market will not 
wait for this arsenic. Then we will discover that the expected 
large quantities of highly pure arsenic will significantly 
exceed Russia's own needs, which are from 15 to 30 tonnes per 
year. 
<H5>  Is It Not Time To Quit Pulling the Wool Over Our Eyes </H5>
  From an ecological standpoint one can speak of the danger of 
the long-term pollution with chemical weapons of approximately 
300 places in Russia. The number of such places in the United 
States has already been documented -- there are 215 of them. 
Thus the problem of withdrawing from the chemical confrontation 
is an all-Russian one and therefore it is above and beyond 
departments. The edict of the president of the Russian 
Federation of 25 May 1992 was seen as an adequate measure. It 
established the Committee on Conventional Problems of Chemical 
and Biological Weapons under the President of the Russian 
Federation (the Kuntsevich Committee). It was assigned the job 
of coordinating the activity of organs of state administration 
for development and implementation of a unified state policy for 
Russia in the area of providing for the fulfillment of 
international commitments regarding chemical weapons. 
  Among the tasks pertaining to the destruction of chemical 
weapons (the tasks of the army and the army alone -- the others 
are only co-performers), the Temporary Statute on the Committee 
included this: The Committee "shall conduct an analysis of 
information on discovered places of burial of old chemical 
weapons, a determination of the degree and scope of the danger 
in these place, and the development of measures for eliminating 
possible sources of danger." As we can see, again this has to do 
with information which only the army has at its disposal. It 
turns out that the Kuntsevich Committee will have to solve only 
army problems, and it is not surprising that his staff included 
"15 military servicemen from among officers in the Armed Forces 
assigned to the Committee according to the procedure and under 
the conditions envisioned by current legislation." The other 
potential dangers that could be determined by nonmilitary 
structures will remain outside the realm of the Kuntsevich 
Committee and in general beyond the purview of any state organ 
of Russia. In particular, the committee's tasks did not include 
searching for and determining the danger of places of past 
production, testing, storage, and burning of chemical weapons, 
not to mention the health of the population. 
  The complex task of cleaning up after the preparation for 
chemical warfare has not been assigned to any state organ of 
Russia. From the standpoint of ensuring ecological safety this 
circumstance could lead to numerous negative, sometimes 
catastrophic, consequences for the country. Nonetheless the 
Kuntsevich Committee for some reason has not turned either to 
the Defense Ministry or to the president. 
  All that is left is to recall the aforementioned thesis 
"America will help us." They will not help us. Very many foreign 
official initiatives, mainly monetary ones, have been frozen 
simply because they do not want to have anything to do with 
General Kuntsevich, and their reasons are apparent. But here is 
the sad thing: They fire at Kuntsevich but they hit Russia. 
During the years of "democracy" our president has purged all the 
democrats in his inner circle with whom he started. But the 
full-fledged, completely canonical militarist Kuntsevich for 
some reason remains. We have already seen something like this 
with a different president in the winter of 1990-1991. 
  There is no point in asking any more questions. As Lavrentiy 
Pavlovich used to say (may this not apply to us), anyone who is 
not blind will see.

rubric: "Chemical Weapons Are a Threat to the Ecology"] 
  [Text] Chemical weapons lost their significance after the 
appearance of the atomic bomb. However, their production is 
continuing in Russia, a fact which threatens the ecology. Lev 
Fedorov, a scientist and chemist, made this declaration 
intending to cause a sensation, on the occasion of presenting 
his book "Chemical Weapons in Russia: History, Ecology, 
Politics." 
  In the scientific work which he presented, Doctor of 
Chemical 
Sciences Fedorov makes public a survey of the events connected 
with the activities of the military-chemical complex, whose 
secrets have traditionally been held "behind seven seals." 
  The book is full of sensations. In particular, the scientist 
asserts that there are about 100 geographic regions in Russia, 
where it is a threat to one's life and health to live, as a 
result of the production, testing or storage of toxic substances 
for military use.

<F P=106>   [Article by Andrey Zhdankin: "A Chemical Warfare Romance"] </F>
  [Text] It is no accident that the Universal Human 
Rights Declaration begins with an article on the human right to 
life: After all, if it is not guaranteed, who will take 
advantage of the others? 
  Unfortunately, our domestic history is a history of 
complete neglect of human rights. Even in cases when they are 
officially declared. Times are changing a little, but even today 
it is frequently impossible to exercise in practice the rights 
and freedoms that are registered on paper. 
  The right to life is an empty sound if, for example, a 
person does not know specifically what is threatening his life. 
And if everyone is aware of the dangers of nuclear war, the 
"chemical bomb," which is still being kept in our home, contains 
a number of unpleasant surprises, but the most important thing 
is that few know about them. 
  Citizens of Western countries know precisely how much 
and what kinds of poison they have stored up, where and how to 
destroy it, and the extent to which it threatens their life and 
even their comfort. The situation is different in our country. 
The passions surrounding chemical weapons, which have recently 
burst out of the zone of departments into the field of public 
discussion, confirm that nobody knows the complete, terrible 
picture of military-chemical socialist realism except for a 
small circle of generals of the military-chemical complex. Any 
attempt to make this knowledge public even now is punishable 
under the law. And the power of a chemical charge is such that 
if, God forbid, it were to explode a large proportion of the 
country's population would become mutants. 
<H5>  Glasnost for Export </H5>
  The domestic press started discussing chemical weapons and 
problems related to destroying them two or three years ago. The 
opening of this topic might be called the last gasp of 
Gorbachev's glasnost period. 
  The adherence to the new thinking and openness moved the 
country's leaders to confess their military-chemical "sins" and 
in 1987 even to declare to the whole world that the USSR had 
halted production of chemical weapons. A cause for rejoicing -- 
if only the statement were true! In the spring of 1991 President 
M. Gorbachev crowned the work of the secret group of comrades 
with the Lenin Prize. The service to the homeland was the 
development of a binary weapon whose killing force exceeded 
everything created previously. In case anybody does not know, 
let us emphasize that the prize is now awarded without the 
production of an experimental-industrial batch. At the beginning 
of last year Russia signed (along with 154 other countries) the 
Paris Convention on banning the development, production, 
accumulation, and application of chemical weapons and also their 
destruction. Our small trick and at the same time unquestionable 
achievement is that the components of the binary gas and the gas 
itself are not included on the lists of banned substances. We 
have a weapon but no violation. 
  One must say that with today's development of military 
technology chemical weapons are an anachronism, simply a poison, 
suitable perhaps only for Saddam Husayn to use to poison the 
recalcitrant Kurds and also for poorly developed countries in 
conflicts among themselves because of the relatively low cost of 
production. 
  Against the background of the nuclear missile standoff, 
chemical weapons are nothing more than "toys" of the generals of 
the military-chemical complex, a way of obtaining rank, awards, 
and positions. Like any other chemical substances, toxic agents 
have precise storage periods, after which they turn into 
ecological bombs that are dangerous only to those who have them. 
And in addition it takes immense amounts of money to destroy 
them. 
  According to the Convention (if it is ratified) we will have 
to destroy our chemical weapon stockpiles before the year 2005. 
In keeping with the edict of the president of Russia, in order 
to develop the corresponding program a Committee on Conventional 
Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons was created in 1992. 
It was headed by one of the generals (in the literal sense) of 
the military-chemical complex, Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, 
who in 1987 had announced the termination of the output of 
chemical weapons by the Soviet Union. Under the banner of 
fighting for the destruction of chemical weapons, the "creme de 
la creme" of the military-chemical complex gathered, people who 
for many years had been working on the development and 
production of this weapon. And, one must add, protecting their 
departmental secrets with their life. 
  The committee announced that we had accumulated 40,000 
tonnes 
of toxic agents. Their position regarding the majority of issues 
was cheerful, almost life-affirming. All the "goods" are 
reliably protected. For destruction they could use the former 
capacities for producing the same toxic agents. One sticking 
point was that the unreasonable population of the regions where 
the plants are located was resisting for some reason. Therefore 
they would most likely have to be destroyed not in the places 
where they were produced but in the places where they were being 
stored. 
  The first facility for destroying toxic agents was built 
several years ago in Chapayevsk. 
<H5>  A War Against Our Own People </H5>
  Chapayevsk -- the city, or rather the people living there, 
had suffered through more than their share of military-chemical 
woes. During the war years the local plant produced cartridges, 
mines, and bombs containing mustard gas and lewisite. The safety 
technology for working with toxins was out of the stone age: 
They were removed from the tank cars into barrels with hoses, 
and from the barrels to the ammunition in buckets and jars. The 
angry god Moloch ate up many people, most of them prisoners. 
During peace time the plant had started making pesticides, which 
involves the formation of an immense quantity of dioxin, which 
disturbs the human immune system just as much as AIDS. The 
purification of waste waters and discharges into the atmosphere 
in those days, especially during the difficult times for the 
military, were largely hypothetical concepts. Now the ecology 
has been mutilated so much that 90 percent of the births there 
are pathological. Only 8 percent of the children are born 
normal. That is degeneration. 
  According to the figures in the bulletin "Ecology and 
Conversion" published by the Volga Information Agency in 
Saratov, there are 29 locations in Russia where chemical weapons 
were produced. On that list are Moscow, Volgograd, Bereznyaki 
(Perm Oblast), Novocheboksarsk (Chuvashia), Dzerzhinsk (Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast), and Nizhniy Tagil (Yekaterinburg Oblast). To 
this group must be added the main places where chemical weapons 
were tested. There are nine of them. When you add to these the 
24 places where this poison was stored (warehouses), you get a 
fairly full but not a final picture of the theater of military 
operations in which for many years a chemical war was being 
waged against their own people. 
  This is no exaggeration for the sake of making a point. 
Military chemistry left the land and water poisoned in all of 
the aforementioned places. One need not go far; in Moscow in 
Kuzminki from the 1920's until the end of the 1950's there was 
functioning a chemical test site belonging to the Central 
Scientific Research Military-Technical Institute (TsNIVTI). Here 
during the twenties they conducted open tests of mustard gas, 
lewisite, and phosgene, and then they destroyed the toxic 
substances in the same place. It was the idea of the military at 
that time that destruction meant burial in the ground. Nobody 
except the military chemists knows how dangerous it is to live 
there. Valeriy Menshchikov, deputy chairman of the Committee on 
Ecology of the past Supreme Soviet of Russia, thinks that there 
is more than one such test site in Moscow. "We will be simply 
terrified when we learn the truth about Moscow alone!" 
  If they would not spare the capital, there is no need even 
to 
speak of any other sites. The majority of them are located in 
the Volga Basin, where almost one-third of Russia's population 
live. 
  Wastes from the Volgograd Khimprom, where no less than two 
years after the announcement of the termination of the 
production of chemical weapons they were still producing soman, 
were disguised in the general waste waters. The so-called "white 
sea" into which these wastes were discharged joins with the 
residential quarters of the city. In the spring of 1964 during a 
flood the "sea" broke through into the Volga. From Volgograd to 
its mouth the river's entire surface was white with dead fish. 
  At the Novocheboksarsk Khimprom, one of the leaders in the 
production of the poison, in 1974 there was an extremely large 
fire in shop No. 83. VI-X gas was produced there. The fire 
turned into a large-scale ecological disaster. The aftermath was 
covered up, not cleaned up. 
  The list of crimes could be continued. There was, for 
example, the burial of chemical weapons (both our own and 
captured ones) in the seas that wash our country's shores: the 
Baltic, White, Barents, and Okhotsk. How much of what was buried 
and where, and when will it all explode? The generals mollify 
us: "Everything is in order, we have it under control, there is 
no danger." The starfish in the White Sea "spilled the beans." 
They up and died at the very height of perestroyka, and in 
immense quantities at that. 
  We learn about only the largest catastrophes; the crimes 
committed from day to day, little by little, remain outside our 
field of vision. 
<H5>  How Much Poison Do the Generals Have Up Their Sleeves </H5>
  The primary question is specifically what quantity of 
supplies we have. The official figure -- 40,000 tonnes -- tells 
us nothing whatsoever. Independent experts cite much larger 
figures, reaching up to 400,000 tonnes. Doctor of Chemical 
Sciences Lev Fedorov, who knows the problem well, and Vil 
Mirzayanov, who published in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI an article 
entitled "Poisoned Politics," at the request of the last Supreme 
Soviet, or, more precisely, its Committee on Ecology, painted a 
picture of our "achievements" in the development of chemical 
weapons. It diverges terribly from the official version. 
  The official list does not include phosgene, diphosgene, or 
prussic acid, which up until the sixties were included in the 
concept of chemical weapons, predominantly in army arsenals, and 
were produced on a large scale. 
  In response to the American threat the USSR prepared for 
herbicide war. The aforementioned A. Kuntsevich was awarded the 
title of Hero of Socialist Labor for his work on the Foliant 
program. Something was set aside for practical use as well. 
  L. Fedorov has calculated that from 1940 through 1945, 
77,000 
tonnes of mustard gas were produced, but only 690 tonnes were 
turned in for destruction along with another 1,010 tonnes of a 
mixture of mustard gas and lewisite. A difference of 75,000 
tonnes. What they did with this poison is no idle question. 
There is a similar picture with lewisite of which, according to 
the most modest calculations, 20,601 tonnes were produced and 
6,585 tonnes were turned in. Mustard gas was produced up until 
1940 and, mixed with lewisite, it was still being produced after 
1945. And where are the toxic substances of the third generation 
mentioned by the scientist from Volsk, Vladimir Uglev, a 
dissident of the military-chemical complex? Uglev made them with 
his own hands. Vil Mirzayanov was taken to court for mentioning 
them in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI. The newspapers did not conduct an 
investigation of this disgraceful trial; they had more important 
things on their mind. Since authorized organs regarded this as 
disclosure of a state secret, it meant that the weapons actually 
did exist. 
  To sum up what has been said, the list of chemical weapons 
turned in for destruction is, to put it mildly, very incomplete. 
The military-chemical monster has many "surprises" up its 
sleeve. Each of them is fraught with terrible tragedies. 
  L. Fedorov included a list of our "achievements" in a 
reference which was burned on the 19th floor of the White House 
while parliament was being fired upon. There is a twist of 
fate... But before its demise the Supreme Soviet "cut" the 
program for destruction of chemical weapons proposed by the 
Committee on Convention Problems. Now the military-chemical 
lobby is trying to work its program in again. On 15 January 
sector chief of the convention committee, Igor Vlasov, stated in 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA that "after remarks and corrections the draft 
was adopted." One wonders by whom? The old parliament did not 
approve it and the new one has not discussed it, and neither the 
president nor the prime minister has made any public statement 
regarding this subject. 
  In the brief history of the creation of the domestic program 
for the destruction of chemical weapons there is an episode that 
explains the motives for the behavior of people responsible for 
solving the problem. The developers demanded a considerable sum 
for the program for destruction: The apportionment was curious. 
For the reprofiled military chemistry facilities in 
Novocheboksarsk, Kambarka, Gornyy, Volsk-17, and Shikhani -- the 
construction of a diagnostic center and capacities for 
destroying toxic substances, reconstruction of railroads, and 
solving social problems of the population--they asked R836 
million (prices from a year ago). Kuntsevich and his 
subordinates asked for 90 percent of the foreign currency 
expenditures or, more specifically, $494 million for "measures 
for providing for national and international oversight." 
Translating this phrase into the language of simple concepts, it 
means that the money will be used for trips of official 
specialists, per diem, representation expenses, and other such 
goodies. Per diem was planned at $400 per day! 
  When presenting their brainchild, the developers of the 
draft 
decided to be cunning -- they did not report on the last page, 
which contained the breakdown of expenditures. Apparently there 
is no point in trying to shame these people, but it would not 
hurt for others to give it some thought: Can a difficult problem 
be entrusted to people who are prepared to spend 90 percent of 
the foreign currency on taking care of their own comfort? 
  The proceedings against Vil Mirzayanov demonstrate the 
undiminishing power of the military-chemical lobby. Their chairs 
were just rocked a bit. The generals, after saluting, cheerfully 
adjusted to the destruction. And again they are afloat, with 
money and rank. Not simply survival but a comfortable existence 
has been provided for more than the next 10 years. 
<H5>  The War Continues </H5>
  In the meantime the concealed surpluses of toxic substances 
are being destroyed in a hurry and in a barbaric way. During the 
past two years the main chemical test site left in Shikhani 
(Saratov Oblast) has been operating with a heavy load. After the 
collapse of the Union the test site on the Ust-Yurt plateau 
gained sovereignty; all the work and the specialists were 
transferred to the banks of mother Volga. The leaders of the 
test site, of course, assert that no destruction is taking place 
but, for example, V. Uglev, who worked for 15 years at GITOS -- 
Main Institute of Technology of Organic Synthesis -- located on 
the territory of the test site, and many others saw the 
explosions with their own eyes. 
  Sometimes toxic substances are simply burned or they are 
even 
poured out "on the landscape." What threat does this present? In 
two years the number of oncological diseases in the rayon 
doubled, and now it exceeds the average level in Russia by 2.5 
times. Last summer ulcers began to appear on the skin of the 
local residents, especially after it rained. The clinical 
picture is very similar to the effects of blistering agents 
(mustard gas, lewisite, and mixtures of them). The military 
blames the grass cow parsnip which, according to data from the 
plant protection station, is encountered very rarely in those 
parts. They can give as many arguments back and forth as they 
want to, but they will continue to destroy them as they have 
been doing unless a team from the higher leaders steps in. 
  But the country's leaders are exhibiting Olympian calm and 
complete ignorance of these problems, as though all this were 
happening in a foreign country. But the country and its citizens 
are in the position of hostages; held by a group of people 
joined together by selfish corporate interests. In spite of all 
the changes in society, socialist realism prevails as before in 
the military chemical sphere. But the problem has already gotten 
out of departmental control and the pretty little picture is 
about to collapse. All they have to do is officially recognize 
some "trivia" and it will be necessary to admit all the rest. It 
would be better if this were to take place more quickly.

  [Text] The press center of the Russian missile force has 
disclosed that during the recent incident at a strategic 
military unit in Siberia there was no threat to the population 
whatsoever. 
  As has been reported, on 10 March a soldier on duty suddenly 
opened fire and killed his commanding officer and wounded 
several other fellow servicemen. The soldiers guarding the 
military facility refrained from returning fire for fear of 
hitting the fuel tanks of missiles with nuclear warheads. 
  According to the statement from the press center of the 
missile force, the system of the duty roster in such units 
guarantees nuclear security in ordinary as well as in emergency 
situations. Information carried by the daily IZVESTIYA about a 
supposed threat of a nuclear missile conflict is groundless, the 
statement says.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Visit" rubric: "Bill </F>
Perry Begins Talks in Moscow. U.S. Defense Secretary To 
Encounter Problems in the CIS"] 
  [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary Bill Perry arrives in Moscow 
today. At 1130 he will meet with General Pavel Grachev. The 
visit is purely working in nature, which is why "no agreements 
will be signed during the visit in Moscow," Pavel Grachev said 
to your SEGODNYA correspondent. 
  Bill Perry will stay in Moscow for two days. He is scheduled 
to meet not only with Defense Ministry chiefs, but also with 
Oleg Soskovets, Andrey Kozyrev, and Ivan Rybkin. Perry will 
then leave for Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine, where he will 
continue his "fact-finding mission," as such voyages are usually 
termed in America. 
  The visit's working status will enable Perry to discuss a 
wide range of problems: the situation in Russia and Bosnia, the 
"Partnership for Peace," nuclear and chemical disarmament, 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, flank quotas under 
the CFE Treaty, and the ABM Treaty. 
  Currently Russia does not have global differences in 
principle with the United States, but there is a multitude of 
minor problems that are hard to resolve. At present it is quite 
clear that cash- poor Russia needs assistance in order to 
fulfill its obligations with regard to nuclear and chemical 
weapons. Washington is in principle ready to pay, but it would 
like to be able to supervise the way the U.S. taxpayers' money 
is being spent. 
  Yesterday, U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and Russian 
Federation Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov managed to 
agree in Washington on giving inspectors access to the storage 
sites of the two countries' "nuclear warhead plutonium 
components." The Americans would also like directly to observe 
the process of the warheads' dismantlement (for the same amount 
of money), but Russian nuclear specialists would rather keep the 
secrets of "operational" warheads' specific design. 
  An even more difficult problem concerns flank quotas for 
heavy armaments under the CFE Treaty. In Georgia, Armenia, and 
in the North Caucasus there is currently more armored equipment 
than what is allowed by the Paris Treaty of 1990 and the 
Tashkent Protocol of 1992. The CFE Treaty is scheduled to go 
into force from the beginning of 1995; Russia insists that the 
limitations be renegotiated, whereas Turkey demands that they be 
adhered to without fail. Ankara has also expressed its 
willingness to send its peacekeeping troops under a UN flag to 
Abkhazia (at Georgia's request), something which Moscow, in 
turn, opposes. 
  Representatives of the Clinton administration have so far 
expressed their "sympathy and understanding" with regard to all 
conflicting sides in the CIS and around it. After holding 
intensive consultations in Moscow and other capitals, Bill Perry 
will apparently find much extra food for thought.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Vitaliy Chukseyev report: "Nuclear Passions </F>
in the Pentagon"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Discussions have started up in the 
Pentagon and other U.S. military "think tanks" about the 
possible use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries as 
a counterstrike measure or means of deterrence against a 
chemical- or biological-weapons attack. The justification for 
this discussion is the annual Defense Department report 
submitted to the President and the Congress. The weekly DEFENSE 
NEWS reports that it contains a proposal to look at the 
possibility of taking such a step in the light of the U.S. 
renunciation of chemical and biological weapon use. 
  All this introduces a new element into the formulation of a 
new U.S. nuclear strategy in the conditions following the end of 
the Cold War. It is very clear that a U.S. repudiation of its 
pledge not to use these weapons against nonnuclear countries 
will have far-reaching consequences and will also necessitate 
major corrections to the priorities by which the Pentagon and 
the Department of Energy are guided in their expenditure. As 
Jack Mendelssohn, deputy director of the Arms Control 
Association, stated, these two departments "are just itching for 
an excuse to hang on to and modernize their arsenals." The U.S. 
commitment not to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear 
countries which was adopted in 1978 and which became an element 
in the 1968 Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons is 
also under threat. 
  Opponents of the review note that it will strike a blow 
against the efforts being made by Bill Clinton's Administration 
in the sphere of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, whereas 
its supporters believe that this step will act as a deterrent in 
relations with those countries which are striving to develop the 
means to wage chemical and biological war. 
  But who will get the upper hand?

  [Text] Washington, 19 Mar -- A document was signed in the 
U.S. capital on 18 March that defines the mechanism for 
monitoring deals involving supplies to the United States of 
Russian Uranium, and its sale on U.S. and world markets, an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from Russian diplomatic 
sources. 
  The "Protocol on Transparency" concluded by the Russian 
Federation Atomic Energy Ministry and the U.S. Department of 
Energy outlines practical ways to implement the earlier signed 
bilateral agreement between Russia and the United States on 
highly-enriched Russian Uranium extracted from dismantled 
nuclear warheads. It will be degraded and delivered to the 
United States in the form of lowly-enriched Uranium to be sold 
to U.S. and other consumers. 
  A senior Russian diplomat said in a conversation with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent that the U.S. Government now has 
guarantees that the lowly-enriched Uranium coming from Russia 
has originally been extracted from nuclear warheads. The U.S. 
side is providing the Russian side with guarantees that the 
Russian lowly-enriched Uranium will be used exclusively for 
peaceful ends, not only in the United States, but also in cases 
of its re-export to other countries.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Deal With United States Is </F>
Advantageous"] 
  [Text] The "uranium deal" with the United States is 
advantageous to Russia, Nikolay Yegorov, Russian Federation 
deputy minister of atomic energy, believes. It will help 
Russian enterprises to survive. 
  On his return from Washington, where he signed an 
appropriate 
document with the U.S. secretary of commerce, Nikolay Yegorov 
disclosed that over the next two years Russia will now be able 
to supply the United States with up to 3,000 tonnes of uranium 
concentrate and a considerable quantity of enriched uranium 
worth a total of $150 million. Previously there were no 
deliveries in view of the agreement imposed on Russia in 1992 
whereby the export of Russian uranium was authorized only at 
prices that were effectively 1.5 times the world prices, the 
deputy minister emphasized. 
  Now an opportunity is opening up to resume sales on U.S. 
markets, which will help Russian uranium-extracting enterprises 
to improve their position. A special feature of the new 
agreement is the establishment of a procedure for joint sales 
whereby 50 percent of the Russian deal is combined with a 
similar quantity of American sales, and this mixed uranium is 
sold to consumers. 
  "The next two years will be especially difficult for 
Russia," 
Nikolay Yegorov said. "So the extra sources of freely 
convertible currency will come in very handy." 
<H5>  Russian Industry To Stop Production </H5>
<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Russia's atomic industry 
will be ready to stop the production of weapon-grade plutonium 
by late 1994. A Russo-American agreement to this effect is 
planned to be signed as early as in summer. The arrangement was 
reached during a visit of Russian specialists to the United 
States, Valeriy Bogdan, business manager of the Russian Ministry 
of Atomic Energy, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  Three reactors producing weapon-grade plutonium continue to 
operate in Russia (one in Krasnoyarsk-26 and two in Tomsk-7). 
But these are dual-purpose reactors. They supply energy and 
heating not only to Krasnoyarsk-26 and Tomsk-7, but also to 
regional centres. The Ministry of Atomic Energy planes to phase 
out these reactors in 1997-1998. Their service life is almost 
completed. District power plants will be built instead. 
  Storages in Russia are now filled to the limit with 
weapon-grade plutonium and with plutonium released from 
dismantled nuclear weapons. There are large plutonium 
stockpiles in Russia and in the United States and there is no 
sense in continuing to manufacture plutonium. 
  However, Russia is now short of funds, and from the 
economical viewpoint it cannot stop plutonium-producing reactors 
and replace them with district power plants. Valeriy Bogdan 
believes it is necessary to reach agreement with the United 
States so that it help resolve the financial problem. The 
United States has stated the intention of helping to get funds, 
without giving guarantees of money, he said. 
<H5>  Pessimistic Outlook for Global Missile Defenses </H5>
<F P=106> [Article by political scientist Aleksandr Savelyev: "Joint </F>
Ballistic Missile Defense: It Is Essential To Shed Illusions"] 
  [Text] More than two years have elapsed since the president 
of Russia proposed the creation of a global system of protection 
against ballistic missiles based on international cooperation. 
It was a question of partnership primarily with the United 
States in this sphere. In the summer of 1992 the idea came up to 
acquire new precise forms and was reflected in the documents on 
the results of the top-level meeting of the leaders of Russia 
and the United States. The creation of working groups, which 
were to have formulated recommendations for the implementation 
of this program, was announced, after which the parties could 
switch to specific action to strengthen both their own and 
international security. 
  But the enthusiasm of the supporters of this idea, of those 
who believed that the main purpose of a GDS [global defense 
system] should be to combat ballistic missiles directly by way 
of the creation and deployment of an efficient ABM system, was 
dampened. As ascertained shortly afterward, neither Russia nor 
the United States intended going beyond the framework of the 
Soviet-American treaty limiting ABM systems concluded in 1972 -- 
the ABM Treaty. And this meant that the sphere of a defense 
system was from the outset narrowed down to combating only 
nonstrategic ballistic missiles: After all, the ABM Treaty 
prohibits the creation, testing, and deployment of ABM systems 
and componentry intended for combating strategic ballistic 
missiles, except for those of a fixed-ground basing mode. They 
may only be deployed in a specified area in a strictly limited 
quantity. 
  True, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs attempted to 
portray matters such that the ABM Treaty does not prevent the 
joint creation and deployment even of strategic antimissile 
defenses inasmuch as it limits, allegedly, only national, not 
international, programs in this sphere. But in connection with 
the Clinton administration's manifest lack of interest in 
systems of combating strategic ballistic missiles and the shift 
in American policy toward tactical ABM systems, such statements 
had no in any way serious effect. And discussions are under way 
in Geneva within the framework of the meetings of the SCC 
[Standing Consultative Commission] as to what specifications of 
tactical antimissile systems could permit a judgment to the 
effect that they do not conflict with the ABM Treaty. 
  Last year saw the elimination of the SDI program, which by 
that time had been transformed into a global system of 
protection against limited strikes and could have been the basis 
for a GDS, and the organization handling its implementation. The 
"tactical" part of this program, which was preserved, was 
transferred to the category of conventional departmental efforts 
and is now under the control of the U.S. Army. 
  Thus the United States and Russia are as yet concentrating 
their attention on questions of the ABM Treaty, and the idea of 
a GDS has gone no further than talk and general discussion, 
although the sphere of tactical ABM defense remains open for 
cooperation. Neither the United States nor West European 
countries and states of the Asia-Pacific region have by any 
means lost interest here in highly efficient ABM systems capable 
of combating ballistic missiles, the threat of whose 
proliferation long since became a reality. 
  But not everything is going that smoothly here either. Thus 
the United States is making persistent attempts to push onto 
foreign markets its upgraded PAC-3 Patriot system and also the 
THAAD [theater high-altitude area defense] tactical ABM system 
which is being developed. A serious competitive struggle, which 
is being conducted according to all the rules of the market, has 
developed here between Russia, which is offering on foreign 
markets its S-300, and the United States. Specifically, 
representatives of the United States are attempting to discredit 
the S-300, voicing doubts as to its effectiveness. Statements 
are being made, for example, to the effect that inasmuch as the 
S-300 has not undergone testing according to the standards 
accepted in the United States, the declared efficiency of this 
system is dubious. For its part, Russia could put pressure on 
the THAAD program at the discussion in the Standing Consultative 
Commission, championing stricter limits on tactical ABM systems. 
This, incidentally, is what the American side greatly fears 
inasmuch as, in the opinion of a number of Western experts, the 
United States' main mission at these discussions is the removal 
of the THAAD system from the ABM Treaty limitations. 
  At the same time, on the other hand, trends toward a 
broadening of cooperation in this sphere are intensifying in the 
West. Thus, according to press reports, NATO could in the very 
near future approve a plan of the creation and deployment of new 
tactical ABM defenses, which are to be an integral part of an 
expanded NATO ABM system. A European ABM would be developed on a 
joint basis. The West European countries are making no secret of 
their fears here that the United States will attempt to a 
greater extent to sell NATO its THAAD system than perform joint 
work on an equal basis. The United States, on the other hand, 
reluctant to remain aloof from so important a program, believes 
that a THAAD system could be merely the basis for the 
development of European ABM defenses. The start of an entirely 
new program on a joint basis cannot be ruled out here. 
  As far as Russia is concerned, the United States and NATO 
are 
hardly prepared to accept it as a partner in the creation of 
tactical ABM systems. And it is not only a question of Russia 
being a potential competitor for these countries on the 
antimissile technology market and not even of the political 
instability in our country still forcing the West to treat the 
prospects of closer rapprochement with Russia, in the military 
sphere included, with a certain wariness. 
  What is most important, rather, is the fact that all these 
programs are being implemented and will be implemented within 
the framework of the competitive military preparations of the 
United States and NATO. They are closely linked with the 
existing structure of the armed forces, of which they are to 
become an organic part. In other words, the tactical ABM systems 
are being made primarily "for themselves" -- for the fulfillment 
of definite and specific assignments which are an integral part 
of more general military plans of the said countries, which, 
incidentally, are very far removed from the idea of the creation 
of a "global" defense. From this viewpoint the programs of 
tactical ABM defenses are not in the least distinguished from 
other military programs of NATO being implemented both 
independently and within the framework of the 
military-industrial integration of the bloc. It would seem 
unlikely under these conditions that the United States would 
begin in parallel one further program in this sphere, but in 
conjunction with Russia this time. Not to mention the additional 
costs. It is a question here of the priorities of policy in the 
sphere of military-technical cooperation, which are 
unequivocally both considerably more to the west and more to the 
east of Russia's borders. 
  But what will become of the idea of the creation of a GDS 
put 
forward at the top level of the leadership of Russia and the 
United States? No global system of defense of the world 
community in the direct meaning of this word will be created in 
the foreseeable future. It could at best be a question only of 
the creation of some new international structures of the Nuclear 
Risk Reduction Center type which are united by the common name 
of GDS and which are no more than a system of the exchange on a 
permanent basis of the corresponding information connected with 
the proliferation of ballistic missiles and the world 
operational situation. But even this program of pseudo-defense 
has enjoyed practically no development in the past two years. 
  In the face of the growing danger of the ever-increasing 
proliferation of missile and nuclear weapons the two leading 
states, which could counterpose to it not only a diplomatic but 
also a defensive, protective mechanism, are deliberately 
shunning this. Tactical ABM defenses, even if things get this 
far, could hardly in the long term be a guarantee of security. 
In addition, having confirmed the restrictions on the creation, 
testing, and deployment of strategic ABM systems and attempting 
to draw a line between strategic and tactical ballistic 
missiles, in terms of warhead reentry velocity, in particular, 
Russia and the United States are providing a good reference 
point for the states endeavoring to possess missile weapons. It 
will now be perfectly clear what missiles an ABM system could 
not combat. There is just one conclusion: It is such missiles 
that need to be acquired.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin "First Hand" report: "When Missiles </F>
`Die'"] 
  [Text] Support centers for implementing arms reduction 
treaties exist in every branch of the Armed Forces but a special 
place is occupied by the Strategic Missile Forces' center, given 
the political realities that exist in the world. So when it 
became necessary to create such centers in Belarus and the 
Ukraine, it was no wonder that they turned to the missile troops 
in particular for their experience. And there is no denying 
that such experience exists there. 
  Suffice it to recall that since the founding of the support 
center -- this dates back to the time of the implementation of 
the Treaty on Intermediate-and Shorter-Range Missiles -- 826 
deployed and non-deployed intermediate-range RSD-10, R-12, and 
R-14 missiles, 608 launchers for those missiles, 60 missile 
operational bases, and dozens of auxiliary installations have 
been scrapped under the organizational control of the Strategic 
Missiles Forces High Command and officers from the center and 
with their direct participation.... 
  The forthcoming work involved in the reduction of strategic 
offensive arms is even larger in scale. The intensity of the 
center's activity is now determined by the fact that missile men 
began the planned destruction of obsolete missile complexes last 
year without even waiting for the ratification of START-I and 
START-II. 
  More than 200 silo-based missile launchers were removed from 
service and then destroyed. A lot of work, notably by the 
center's specialists, went into the creation of the Russian 
destruction bases in Surovatikha and Pibanshurye and the 
preparation of sites for the reception and stationing of U.S. 
inspection groups at Strategic Missile Forces installations.... 
  "The missile troops," Colonel General Aleksandr Petrovich 
Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of the Strategic Missile 
Forces, who heads the entire destruction project, believes, "are 
absolutely ready to ensure the successful fulfillment of all the 
commitments made under the treaty." 
  Who are they, these people who bear the burden of the 
destruction program on their shoulders? Colonel Anatoliy 
Murashenkov, the center's chief, now takes up the story: 
  "Officers of the Support Centers for Implementing Arms 
Reduction Treaties are real missile men. They only employ 
people who have a wealth of military experience, who know 
missile work and technology inside out, and who have years of 
alert duty behind them." 
  Col. Murashchenkov himself, incidentally, was chief of a 
combined unit's operational department prior to his appointment 
to the Support Center (it was called the Center for Destruction 
Management [Tsentr upravleniya likvidatsiyey] then). Prior to 
that he had to learn all there is to know about missile service 
from many posts. Like all the other officers he learned the 
science of weapon destruction "from scratch" and by practical 
experience. No one in the missile forces at that time knew as 
much as he did. 
  I met with other specialists at the center. Colonel Valentin 
Romashev, Colonel Georgiy Khristoforidi, Lieutenant Colonel 
Anatoliy Pavlov, Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Shpirko, Lieutenant 
Colonel Viktor Yakunin.... They, like other officers, have 
clearly defined duties. Some are responsible for the planning 
and coordination of destruction work and monitoring the 
fulfillment of treaty obligations, others are busy with the 
arms-destruction related problems of the military economy 
[voyskovoye khozyaystvo] and the use of the funds thus 
released.... 
  Much time is spent on preparing and providing support for 
the 
inspection work. During the center's six years' existence 316 
inspection groups have visited the Missile Forces alone. They 
monitor progress in implementing the Treaty on Intermediate- and 
Shorter-Range Missiles (reciprocal inspection activity under the 
treaty will not end until the next century) and of conventional 
arms agreements.... 
  "After the completion of special courses," Colonel Vladislav 
Alekseyev says, "the center's officers themselves work in 
inspection groups in the United States, Belgium, Britain, 
Germany, and Italy." 
  Vladislav Arseniyevich, for example, has twice done 
inspection work at the Hercules plants in Salt Lake City. 
  I did not catch the demolition engineers at home that day. 
Colonel Vasiliy Orzhekhovskiy and Colonel Mikhail Kiryushin 
together with their subordinates were busy organizing and 
providing backup for the unique job of destroying silo 
missile-launchers, which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already written 
about and which people have been able to see for themselves in a 
recent Radar TV movie for Ostankino Television. 
  But the duty shift was there that day, as it was supposed to 
be. Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Kirshkovskiy and Major Andrey 
Titov were busy with current operational work, maintaining 
communications with the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center 
and receiving information from the CSCE.... 
  The work at the center seemed to me to be routine and free 
of 
fuss. Even when the latest notification of an inspection from 
the United States arrived I did not see any change in the pace 
of work there. They did not know which Strategic Missile Forces 
installation would be inspected or what scale the inspection 
would be on (there is a memorandum stipulating this), but the 
officers knew well what they had to do in these circumstances. 
Just as they do in all other situations connected with the 
destruction of nuclear missiles, furthermore. 
<H5>  Strategic Missile Launch Postures Examined </H5>
<F P=106> [Article by Major General (retired) Vladimir Semenovich </F>
Belous, head of the Department of Military-Political Studies of 
the Committee of Scientists for Global Security: "Principles of 
Russia's Nuclear Strategy"] 
  [Text] "Political statements of the presidents of the 
two countries about the onset of a new era in relations between 
Russia and the United States cannot in an instant transfer 
relations between the two countries to a fundamentally new 
level." 
  The "Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the 
Russian 
Federation" maintain: "The purpose of the policy of the Russian 
Federation in the sphere of nuclear weapons is the elimination 
of the danger of nuclear war by way of deterring the unleashing 
of aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies." An 
even more complex and multilevel mission is propelled to the 
forefront now -- infusing military doctrine with real content. 
  Russia does not consider as its enemy a single country, 
including its recent potential enemy -- the United States. But 
the two countries' possession of vast nuclear arsenals 
determines the great time lag of the process of disarmament and 
transition to genuine partnership. The political statements of 
the presidents of the two countries about the onset of a new era 
in relations between Russia and the United States cannot in an 
instant transfer relations between the two countries to a 
fundamentally new level. This will take time. 
  The effective model of the composition, structure, and 
functioning of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, therefore, 
will be constructed on the basis of a policy of deterrence of 
the United States. We would note that, as this condition is 
fulfilled, any other potential enemy is deterred also. Nuclear 
weapons are not regarded as weapons of war here, and their sole 
rational function is deterrence. 
  The future composition and structure of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces will be determined by several basic factors: the 
present composition of the nuclear forces; the status of the 
nuclear arsenals of other states; the limitations imposed on the 
strategic nuclear forces by the Russian-American agreements; 
states' economic possibilities; strategic concepts in respect to 
the use of strategic nuclear forces. 
  As we all know, the operational use of strategic nuclear 
forces is possible by of the delivery of: 

  -  a first or preemptive strike; 
  -  a launch on warning 
[otvetno-vstrechnyy udar]; 
  -  a launch under attack [otvetnyy 
udar]. 

    During the Cold War period the main form of operational use 
of strategic nuclear forces in the event of a conflict was 
considered the delivery against the aggressor of a 
launch-on-warning strike, that is, a firing of missiles prior to 
the moment of impact of enemy warheads on the territory of the 
USSR. A particular role was performed here by the high 
operational readiness of the strategic nuclear forces and their 
flexibility [operativnost] and the dependability of the system 
of operational command and control and communications and also 
the efficiency and dependability of the missile-attack warning 
system. The particular relevance of this form of combat 
operations for the Soviet strategic nuclear forces was 
determined by the great relative significance of ground-based 
ICBM's and their relatively low survivability in the event of a 
nuclear attack against them. At the same time, on the other 
hand, this concept increased the risk of an accidental nuclear 
conflict arising, primarily as a consequence of the 
less-than-absolute dependability of the warning systems. The 
strict time limit at the disposal of our country's leadership in 
the event of a signal having been received from a missile-attack 
warning system (10-12 minutes in the case of an attack by 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles -- SLBM's) creates a 
difficult stress situation. A study of various crisis situations 
shows how great is the uncertainty and the probability of an 
inappropriate assessment of the intentions and actions of the 
other side and, as a result, the adoption of the wrong 
decisions. But the operational efficiency of a launch on warning 
is extraordinarily high, which makes it a very powerful means of 
deterrence. 
  The Russian-American agreement on not targeting ballistic 
missiles against one another (it is uncertain as yet whether 
this applies to SLBM's or not, it is true) reduces the risk of 
an accidental nuclear conflict. From the operational-strategic 
viewpoint the agreement also reduces the efficiency of a launch 
on warning. This is particularly sensitive for Russia, for which 
ICBM's account for more than half the nuclear warheads 
(approximately one-fourth for the United States), and the 
off-site restoration of targeting is possible only for new 
classes of missiles. 
  Under the conditions of the lowering of the military 
opposition, the reduction in strategic arms, and the improvement 
in the overall political climate, the probability of the 
delivery of a first nuclear strike is very slight. It would seem 
expedient both for Russia and the United States in the present 
situation, therefore, to renounce the launch-on-warning concept 
and to switch to the launch-under-attack concept. True, this 
form of combat operations is very complicated for the defending 
party and entails great losses of strategic offensive arms and 
the breakdown of facilities of the system of state 
administration and military command and control. As a 
consequence, the efficiency of the retaliatory actions could 
prove very low. A potential aggressor's modeling of such a 
situation could prompt him to take preventive action. An 
orientation in the organizational development of strategic 
nuclear forces solely toward a launch under attack, as some 
analysts are proposing, would make increased demands of their 
quantitative makeup and could create serious impediments in the 
way of a further reduction in strategic nuclear forces. 
  In addition, who could guarantee that complications in 
relations between Russia and the United States will not arise 
and that their interests will not clash in some region of 
geostrategic importance? Consequently, the launch-on-warning 
concept has a right to exist also, and to renounce it 
conclusively would be imprudent. 
  Let us consider one further possible scenario of a military 
conflict. Let us imagine that as a result of territorial claims 
against Russia a country in an alliance with a nuclear power has 
mounted combat operations. Enemy aviation is striking with 
precision weapons at most important targets, including the 
position of the strategic nuclear forces, endeavoring to put 
them out of action. The Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff is 
reporting losses: 15 percent of ICBM launchers have been put out 
of commission. In three days losses have amounted to 25 percent. 
The legitimate question arises: What should Russia's Supreme 
Command do in this situation? What is the permissible limit of 
losses of strategic nuclear forces? The simplest analysis of 
such a situation shows that in the course of combat operations, 
conditions could take shape wherein Russia's strategic nuclear 
forces are forced on pain of destruction to be the first to use 
nuclear weapons. This, inter alia, determines Russia's 
abandonment of the USSR's former undertaking concerning no first 
use of nuclear weapons. 
  At the present time, when the probability of a nuclear 
conflict is very slight, priority significance belongs to the 
launch-under-attack concept, which, most likely, will be 
pertinent in the immediate future also. In the event of a crisis 
situation arising, the launch-on-warning concept could become 
paramount. And, finally, in the event of combat operations being 
unleashed against Russia with the use of conventional weapons, 
conditions objectively determining the need for first use of 
nuclear weapons could take shape. 
  It should be noted that the American strategic nuclear 
forces, both at the present time and following the planned 
reductions, will be oriented toward the accomplishment of the 
entire set of operational assignments. The retention of 500 
highly accurate Minuteman III ICBM's, which are ready within 30 
seconds, assures the delivery of a launch-on-warning strike. In 
addition, according to J. Lynch, captain of the U.S. Navy, the 
system of command and control of America's missile-firing 
submarines permits them to take part in a launch on warning even 
at the present time. The Minuteman III ICBM's in conjunction 
with the Trident II SLBM's, which are fitted with W-88 warheads 
of increased accuracy (400), are also capable of delivering an 
effective first, counterforce strike. For purely retaliatory 
operations the United States would have approximately 1,750 
warheads on SLBM's and some of the weapons on heavy bombers that 
had managed to get airborne on a tactical warning. 
  The main conclusion, therefore, is that the concept of the 
operations of the Russian strategic nuclear forces should be 
multivariant and adaptive and proceed not from scholastic 
deductions but correspond in each period of time to the 
unfolding geostrategic situation and the degree of the military 
threat to Russia. Consequently, the composition and structure of 
the strategic nuclear forces should in any situation assure the 
efficient performance of all forms of combat operations in 
accordance with the said strategic concepts. What does the 
future composition of the strategic nuclear forces of Russia 
look like from these positions? 
  The priority in the organizational development of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces has thus far been assigned ground-based 
ICBM's, on which up to 65 percent of the nuclear weapons have 
been deployed. Approximately 25 percent of the nuclear weapons 
have been installed on SLBM's, and 10 percent, on heavy bombers. 
The United States has traditionally put the emphasis on the 
sea-based component (55 percent of the nuclear weapons), and the 
remainder of the warheads have been shared approximately equally 
between the ICBM's and SLBM's [as published]. This asymmetry in 
the structure of the two countries' strategic nuclear forces has 
come about by no means accidentally, it has reflected the 
particular features of their geostrategic position, basic views 
on the nature of a possible nuclear conflict, and the scientific 
and technological level of the armaments. 
  The START II Treaty determined only two control figures -- 
the overall number of warheads on strategic delivery systems (up 
to 3,500) and no more than half of them on SLBM's, which affords 
each side the possibility of a display of wide-ranging 
initiative in determination of the composition of its strategic 
offensive arms. Particular significance is attached here for the 
grouping of strategic offensive arms targeted at the delivery of 
a first, counterforce strike to the high accuracy of guidance of 
the warheads to target, which cannot be compensated either by 
their quantity or, even less, by the yield of the weapon. For 
the strategic offensive arms systems intended for retaliatory 
operations, assurance of survivability is the priority. As the 
strategic nuclear forces are reduced, not the quantitative 
parameters of the components of the nuclear triad but their 
operational possibilities and indicators according to the 
"cost-efficiency" criterion will increasingly become paramount. 
  As a result of the structural reorganization of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces there could be a significant increase 
in the proportion of weapons on SLBM's, which would be 
approximately the same as for the United States. But the 
numerical equality of SLBM weapons of Russia and the United 
States obviously assures for the latter, by virtue of the 
qualitative superiority of the American sea-based component, an 
appreciable military advantage. As experience shows, there are 
no more than 20-25 percent of Russia's missile-firing ships on 
operational patrol in the seas at any one time, whereas for the 
United States, up to 40-50 percent. The submarines in base 
become a highly tempting target inasmuch as hundreds of warheads 
deployed on the tied-up missile carriers could be destroyed with 
one or two warheads. 
  Recently the United States and its allies have noticeably 
upgraded the means of observation and the tactics of combating 
submarines. Acoustic antennas, many kilometers long, laid on the 
ocean floor make it possible to keep under constant supervision 
three-fourths of strategically important areas of the Atlantic 
and the Pacific, in which Russian submarines might be operating. 
American multipurpose attack submarines are engaged in constant 
tracking and are perfecting the tactics of combating Russian 
missile carriers in direct proximity to their bases. American 
submarines' repeated encounters with Russian submarines in 
proximity to Russia's shores are convincing testimony to this. 
  The results of the modeling of operational situations in 
ocean expanses performed by Western experts have shown that up 
to 30-40 percent of Russian submarines could be destroyed in the 
course of ASW operations of the initial period of a war. If it 
is considered here that, in the event of a surprise attack, the 
probability of the destruction of the boats in base is very 
high, overall losses in the initial period could amount to 70-80 
percent. Russia's possibilities in the destruction of U.S. 
submarines are far fewer. 
  The fate of the aviation component of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces, which has traditionally been assigned a 
secondary role in all previous nuclear conflict scenarios, will 
remain highly problematical in the coming decade. This is 
explained by the particular features of Russia's geostrategic 
position; the lack of military bases on territory contiguous to 
the United States; the vulnerability to air defense systems; the 
relatively low indicator according to the "cost-efficiency" 
criterion. 
  The situation is further complicated by the fact that a 
substantial portion of the HB (heavy bombers) came to be on the 
territory of Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which hastened to declare 
them their property. This has led to Russia being left with only 
27 heavy bombers capable of carrying cruise missiles and 52 
bombers fitted with nuclear bombs. The extraordinarily high cost 
of a heavy bomber, which is particularly sensitive under the 
conditions of economic crisis, does not permit the expectation 
of a serious increase in its aviation component. But its 
preservation as part of the strategic nuclear forces would seem 
necessary inasmuch as heavy bombers with strategic weapons 
possess a number of properties increasing the flexibility of the 
use of the strategic nuclear forces: the presence on them of a 
system of varied nuclear arms, the possibility of hitting 
unplanned targets, and their return to base in the event of a 
change in the situation or a false alarm. 
  The relatively low efficiency of the sea- and air-based 
components of Russia's strategic nuclear forces objectively 
determines the need for the continuation of the lead role of 
ground-based ICBM's. The Strategic Missiles Forces, which are 
armed with ICBM's, stand out to best advantage among the other 
components of the strategic nuclear forces in terms of their 
hardware provision, operational readiness, dependability of the 
system of operational command and control and communications, 
and developed infrastructure. For almost four decades Russia's 
ICBM's have in terms of their technical level and operational 
efficiency not only not been inferior to the U.S. missiles but 
have frequently been superior to them. The upkeep and 
maintenance of the ICBM's cost far less than the other 
components of the triad. In terms of the "cost-efficiency" 
criterion, the Strategic Missile Forces are unparalleled: 
Possessing 65 percent of the warheads, they consume no more than 
10-12 percent of the military budget. 
  There is a serious debate among specialists about the 
structure of the future ICBM grouping. The supporters of mobile 
ICBM's, referring to their alleged high survivability, propose 
that the proportion of these weapons in the Strategic Missile 
Forces' grouping be raised to two-thirds. 
  At the present time even the United States knows the 
coordinates of all the shelters in which the mobile SS-25's 
(Topol) are deployed, and highly sensitive reconnaissance 
apparatus, which covers several frequency bands, has been 
installed on reconnaissance satellites. This permits the 
detection on Earth of objects the size of a football. The 
detection, therefore, of multiple-axle truck tractors moving out 
to the combat patrol area and their further tracking represent a 
perfectly feasible task. It is known also that the United States 
is working on the creation of maneuverable warheads with the 
correction of their flight trajectory at a command from 
reconnaissance satellites, which is particularly relevant for 
destroying moving targets. It was confidence of success in 
combating Russia's mobile ICBM's that prompted the United States 
to lift its objections to their continuation as part of the 
Strategic Missile Forces' grouping. 
  A significant increase in the survivability of mobile ICBM's 
may be achieved only in the event of their being dispersed and 
moved in vast patrolling areas according to the law of chance, 
which would be very hard to accomplish. 
  An increased risk of accidents during movement in the 
patrolling areas, the limited nature of motor capacity, and 
inadequate protection against sabotage and terrorist actions 
should also be attributed to the shortcomings of mobile ICBM's. 
Five or six times more personnel are needed for their 
maintenance than for stationary systems per launcher. Therefore, 
several tens of thousands of additional personnel would be 
required for the creation of a grouping of 600 mobile ICBM's (as 
some specialists are proposing), which under the conditions of 
the difficulty of fully manning the armed forces is of 
considerable importance also. 
  The upkeep and maintenance of mobile ICBM's costs far more 
than silo systems. It needs to be considered also that mobile 
ICBM's are weapons of retaliatory operations and that their 
possibilities in the delivery of first and launch-on-warning 
strikes are highly limited. 
  The attitude toward mobile ICBM's in the United States is 
highly indicative. Previously the Pentagon had planned the 
deployment of MX missile railroad mounts and ground-based 
Midgetman ICBM's. But after a careful analysis of 
operational-strategic, economic, and environmental factors, it 
abandoned its original intentions. The continuous cruising 
around the country's territory of mounts carrying nuclear 
warheads was considered there to be absolutely unacceptable. 
  In accordance with the arguments cited, it is proposed to 
keep the lead position of stationary ICBM's and have a Strategic 
Missile Forces' grouping composed two-thirds of nuclear weapons 
on stationary systems and one-third on mobile systems. This is 
explained by the following considerations. 
  According to the START II Treaty, Russia is entitled to keep 
105 SS-19 ICBM's, leaving on them one warhead each, and also to 
deploy 90 single-warhead missiles in SS-18 ICBM silos converted 
to accommodate them. In addition, it is necessary to convert for 
this same purpose approximately 400 silos on the territory of 
Russia that are currently housing the obsolete SS-11, SS-13, and 
SS-17 missiles. Thus, with the minimum possible economic outlays 
necessary for modernization of the silos and the gradual 
replacement of the missiles, the stationary ICBM grouping would 
number approximately 600 units. 
  This part of the Strategic Missile Forces' grouping would 
have relatively low survivability, but the high operational 
readiness and accuracy of guidance of the warheads would assure 
for these ICBM's, the only ones of Russia's strategic offensive 
arms, the possibility of the delivery of first, counterforce, 
and launch-on-warning strikes, reducing thereby the asymmetry in 
the operational possibilities of strategic offensive arms with 
the United States. This in itself would be a powerful factor of 
deterrence. It would be expedient here to preserve the existing 
grouping of SS-25 mobile ICBM's (approximately 300), with no 
increase. 
  The impending ratification of the START II Treaty by the new 
parliament of Russia will hardly be cloudless, and an acute 
political struggle over it is to be expected. For the successful 
passage through parliament of this most important 
military-political document it is essential that the Government 
of Russia present convincing operational-strategic, 
military-technical, economic, and environmental justification. 
  Unfortunately, it has to be stated that this was not done 
during the hearings on the START II Treaty in the old 
parliament, and the arguments of its opponents frequently 
appeared quite convincing. Therefore, its fate seemed highly 
problematical. Time will tell whether account will be taken of 
the mistakes of the past.

  [Text] Conversion is entering the life of the Russian 
Plesetsk cosmodrome increasingly widely. The Arkhangelsk Oblast 
newspaper VOLNA reports that last year regular launches of 
launch vehicles made on the basis of combat ICBM's. Thus with 
the aid of the new "Start-1" launch vehicle an experimental 
electronic mail satellite was put into orbit. 
  In all last year 36 space vehicles were launched from the 
world's northernmost cosmodrome, only eight of them in the 
interests of the Defense Ministry. This year's program includes 
the launch of the new "Koronas" geophysical satellite which will 
continue the study of the polar aurora in the upper strata of 
the atmosphere and will begin regular observations of the Sun. 
And the "Okean" satellite will search for shoals of fish and 
investigate the ice on Arctic shipping routes.

  [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- Shifting of targets of 
Russia's nuclear missiles does no damage to security of the 
Russian Federation and other states but is a manifestation of 
confidence and strengthening of strategic stability, Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  The defense minister was commenting on Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's recent order assigning the Defense Ministry 
before May 30 "to take measures aimed at organizing the everyday 
activities of the strategic nuclear forces with non-targeted 
missiles". 
  Pavel Grachev added that the issue on the mutual 
non-targeting of strategic weapons of Russia and the United 
States was raised for the first time at a meeting of the two 
presidents in Vancouver last year. In January this year Boris 
Yeltsin and Bill Clinton confirmed in the Moscow Declaration 
that they would give the appropriate instructions to their 
defense ministries. 
  According to the Russian defense minister, Britain also 
joined this initiative. 
  Pavel Grachev believes that terms of implementing this 
decision will be determined by organizational and technical 
possibilities, and are specific for each kind of strategic 
weapons.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 March -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev intends on 17 and 18 March to visit military formations 
and units in Kaliningrad oblast. He announced this today at a 
meeting with journalists. 
  The head of the country's defense department denied reports 
by some of the foreign mass media that he had not left for 
Leningrad military district because of extreme social tension in 
society requiring, it is claimed, the presence in Moscow of a 
"strong hand". He also said that the reports that troops in 
Moscow military district had allegedly been put on an enhanced 
readiness footing were false. 
  At the ITAR-TASS correspondent's request Pavel Grachev 
explained that he is one of those in possession of a so-called 
nuclear button. One button is with the Russian President, who is 
at present in Sochi; the second button is with himself; and the 
third is with the Chief of the General Staff, who has gone to 
France on a working visit. Pavel Grachev emphasized that, 
although the president has in his possession a control system 
for the strategic nuclear forces in the form of a "small nuclear 
case", there should always be one of the military leaders in 
Moscow at the permanent control point. 
  "This evening the Chief of the General Staff is returning 
from Paris, and tomorrow I shall be leaving for Kaliningrad in 
accordance with the plan for visiting troops", Pavel Grachev 
stated in conclusion.

  [Text] Moscow March 24 ITAR-TASS -- "For the past twenty 
years our enterprise has specialized in manufacturing 
psychotronic devices for arms systems and control systems for 
intercontinental missiles and space vehicles," deputy director 
of a Russian defence enterprise told the Moscow News weekly. 
  Deputy director Martynov also said that his enterprise and 
another company, whose name he did not disclose, has begun to 
produce a physical amplifier (metathrone) Miranda, developed on 
the basis of fundamental achievements in the field of 
psychotronics. 
  The weekly conducted an independent research, which revealed 
that work indeed had been done at the plant to produce 
metathrones, which are regarded as a side branch of psychotronic 
weapons. Such devices have long been used in the American 
industry to locate and establish the causes of any systemic 
failures. 
  The weekly cites specialists as saying that "on September 
24, 
1990 an agreement was signed between the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) of the United States and the KGB of the USSR on 
joint research in the field of psychotronics". 
  The weekly said however that cooperation in this field has 
not developed.

    [Editorial report] Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 
for 10 March 1994 publishes on page 8 a 200-word article by 
Andrey Vaganov entitled "New Publications: Security From the 
Point of View of Academicians," describing the first issue of a 
new journal, GEOPOLITIKA I BEZOPASNOST [Geopolitics and 
Security]. The journal is published by the Geopolitics and 
Security Section of the Military History Division of the Russian 
Federation Academy of Natural Sciences, and printed by the 
Voyentekhizdat printing plant. Vaganov describes it as a 
"200-page, large format academic journal," printed on good paper 
with high-quality printing, with "something for the dilettante 
to read as well as something for the specialist to analyze." He 
quotes the journal's editors as describing it as an 
"experimental journal-almanac." Among the articles in the first 
issue are "Why Democracy Is Triumphing in Russia," by Cornell 
University Profesor Richard Darlington, "Forecast of the State 
and Tendencies for Change in the Geopolitical Map of the World 
in Regions of the Far Abroad," "Ethnographic Factors of Military 
Security," "Military Security and Defense," and "Military 
Aspects of Ecological Security," as well as several articles on 
military history. 
  Vaganov writes that the first issue contains no information 
as to the size of the new journal's print run or its 
periodicity. He speculates that in view of its high-quality 
printing and paper, it will attract no more than 1,000 buyers.

  [Excerpt] Businesslike friendly relations between the 
Republic of Belarus and the United States in the military sphere 
have been developing since 1992. Military specialists from the 
Belarusian and U.S. sides are discussing the primary directions 
of military cooperation, including such problems as conversion, 
control over exporting radioactive materials, training of 
servicemen, and creation of working groups for coordinating 
military cooperation. Today, the honored U.S. visitor [Defense 
Secretary Perry] was received by Belarusian Defense Minister 
Pavel Kazlowski and Council of Ministers Chairman Vyacheslav 
Kebich. In the afternoon, the defense secretary visited the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet. During William Perry's visit, U.S. 
experts and managers of the largest industrial enterprises in 
Belarus worked on the issues of conversion. First Deputy 
Defense Minister Alyaksandr Tyshynski, leader of the working 
group's Belarusian team announced the results of the joint 
activities. [begin recording] 
  Tyshynski, in Russian: Esteemed U.S. Minister [as 
heard] Perry, esteemed Pavel Pavlavych [Kazlowski]! At today's 
meeting, we exchanged opinions on many aspects of cooperation. 
We heard detailed reports by Mr. Barry Carter and Mr. Pugachev, 
who is chief of the Defense Ministry Scientific-Technical 
Committee. To many questions asked by the representatives of 
industries... [Tyshynski changes thought] Today, one-third of 
the largest enterprises are present here, those at which 
conversion is beginning. Those are the Belarusian optics and 
mechanical amalgamation Belomo headed by General Manager Hurski, 
the production amalgamation of computing equipment headed by 
General Manager Kharlap, and the production amalgamation 
Integral headed by its Chief Engineer Kaloshin. We heard short 
reports and answers to many questions asked by [words 
indistinct] enterprises. It was interesting for the Belarusian 
side to hear about the possibilities for expanding cooperation 
in many other directions (?including) the Nunn-Lugar direction. 
It would now be very important and appropriate to form a 
committee for the conversion of defense industries that would 
accelerate the implementation of those projects that have been 
set up almost two years ago and will enable expansion of 
conversion of [word indistinct] enterprises. Let me give the 
floor to Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Pavlavych Kazlowski. 
  Kazlowski, in Russian: Esteemed defense minister, 
gentlemen. I am happy to realize that between the Republic of 
Belarus and the United States, between our armies and nations 
stable businesslike relations are developing. The declaration 
which we are going to sign on the principles of the Joint 
Committee for Conversion of the Enterprises of Defense 
Industries confirms the mutual [word indistinct] striving of the 
sides for peace, and orienting the defense complex toward the 
needs of a civilian society. The problems of conversion are 
just one of the components of the developing cooperation, and 
today, we talked about many elements of this cooperation. This 
is a demonstration of peaceful trends inherent in our state. 
The rather high activity of meetings and negotiations at 
different levels between the Ministries of Defense is a 
demonstration of mutual interest, necessity, and the long-range 
nature of our relations. In its domestic policy, Belarus has 
chosen the path of social peace and accord, and the development 
of human rights and freedoms. Their priority character has been 
certified by our Republic's legal acts. Belarus has proclaimed 
its non-nuclear status, its striving to become a neutral state, 
and is continuously and unconditionally observing its 
commitments. We are grateful to you, Mr. Minister for your 
understanding of the problems of the Belarusian people, your 
readiness to cooperate and assistance in [words indistinct]. I 
would like you to pass our best wishes of wealth, happiness, and 
prosperity to the people and the President of the United 
States.[end recording] 
  The ceremony of signing the agreement on principles of the 
joint committee for conversion has started. The floor was then 
given to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.[passage omitted 
on Perry comments]

  [Text] The withdrawal of Russia's strategic missile forces 
deployed in Belarus has already begun. This relates to the 
Mazyr and Lida missile divisions composed of eight missile 
regiments equipped with 72 launching facilities. The divisions 
are armed with the portable ground-based missile systems RS-12M 
and Topal. 
  In 1993, one missile regiment was withdrawn from Pastawy, 
Vitsebsk Oblast, to Russia. In 1994, another four regiments 
with 36 launching facilities will be withdrawn from Belarus. 
The last regiments will be pulled out in 1995. In 1996, the 
Mazyr and Lida divisions will cease to exist.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Belorussia [Belarus] Gives Up </F>
Strategic Nuclear Systems Forever. Now Only Russia Will Have 
Them"] 
  [Text] The full-scale withdrawal from Belorussian 
territory to Russia of the Strategic Rocket Forces grouping 
temporarily stationed in the cities of Mozyr and Lida has begun. 
IZVESTIYA's military correspondent learned this from 
well-informed sources in the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  The Strategic Rocket Forces grouping in the Republic of 
Belorussia comprised two divisions (eight missile regiments) 
armed with the RS-12M "Topol" road-mobile missile system or, as 
it was called in the West, the SS-25. A total of 72 launchers. 
  The first regiment (nine "Topols") stationed in Postavy was 
withdrawn to Russia back in summer 1993. The next four 
regiments (36 launchers) will leave the republic in 1994 in 
accordance with the schedule agreed by the two states' defense 
ministries, and the rest in 1995. By mid-1996 the Mozyr and 
Lida missile divisions will have totally ceased to exist, they 
will be disbanded in accordance with the START Treaty. 
  At the same time the arms and combat hardware withdrawn from 
Belorussian territory will be deployed at Strategic Rocket Force 
bases and arsenals -- they are to replace missiles and launchers 
that have outlived their service life in those regiments on 
combat alert duty on Russian territory that do not come under 
the START-1 and START-2 Treaties. 
  Our newspaper has already reported (No. 25, 9 February) that 
the modernized RS-12M system's standardized solid-fuel 
multiple-warhead missile is to be the basis of Russia's 
Strategic Rocket Forces. Moreover the ratio between fixed-site 
and mobile systems will be 30-40:70-60. 
  Specialists have calculated that these systems and the 
delivery to target of their warhead will cost the country 3-5 
times less than for the sea-based nuclear forces and 5-10 times 
less than for the air force, although they do not cancel out the 
two other components of the nuclear triad. At the same time 
mobile launchers' survivability is 4-5 times greater than that 
of fixed-site launchers. 
  It is very hard to ascertain the location of a wheeled 
vehicle in a vast position area, but silo coordinates are always 
known. To support this idea specialists cite the example of the 
obsolete Iraqi Scud systems, whose launch preparations took many 
hours. During the Gulf War state-of-the-art U.S. reconnaissance 
systems, including space reconnaissance, were unable to detect 
them on the move and in position areas and consequently avert 
missile launches. 
  This factor, as well as many others, promises the Russian 
"Topols" a good future. 
  Incidentally, officers and warrant officers from the missile 
regiments being withdrawn from Belorussia and disbanded, along 
with the enlisted men and NCO's on compulsory military service 
and contract personnel, will not be discharged into the reserve. 
They will make up the strength of other Strategic Rocket Forces 
units experiencing today a considerable shortage of specialist 
missilemen of all kinds. I was assured at the Rocket Forces 
Main Staff that they have all been guaranteed the social rights 
and benefits extended to soldiers of the Russian Federation. 
  Officers and warrant officers from the regiments being 
withdrawn to Russia who do not want to leave Belorussia will be 
discharged into the reserve. They will enjoy all the rights of 
the citizens of the state in which they have remained to live, 
they and their families will keep the apartments in which they 
are now living, and those who have served in the army for 20 
years or more will be paid a military pension in line with 
current legislation. At the Strategic Rocket Forces Main Staff 
I was assured that there has not been a single case of 
infringement of the legitimate rights of the Russian troops 
remaining in Belorussia. 
  Once the strategic offensive arms installations have been 
eliminated on Belorussian territory, the missilemen's military 
camps will be handed over to the republic's defense ministry and 
the vacated apartments to people on the military department's 
waiting list or to other Belorussian citizens. 
  Once it has given up its "Topols" Belorussia will be the 
only 
post-Soviet state to have carried out its commitments to the 
world community without any conditions and stipulations and to 
have really subscribed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear country.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin report: "For Civilized Countries </F>
Missiles Are Not a Bargaining Chip"] 
  [Text] Two missile regiments stationed on Belorussian 
[Belarusian] territory in Mozyr and Lida have started to 
withdraw their weapons and military hardware to Russian 
territory. 
  A grouping of Strategic Missile Forces comprising two 
missile 
divisions is currently stationed on Belorussian territory. They 
include 8 missile regiments armed with RS-12M Topol road-mobile 
missile complexes. The total number of missile launchers is 72. 
  Under this year's jointly agreed timetable, one-half of 
these 
will be withdrawn from Belorussia [Belarus] to Russia, and the 
rest will follow by the end of next year. By the middle of 1996 
the Mozyr and Lida Divisions will be completely disbanded. All 
the missile troops' military bases and housing compounds will be 
handed over to the Belorussian side. We already have experience 
of this work. Last summer nine missile launchers were withdrawn 
from Postavy to Russia following close cooperation between the 
Russian and Belorussian sides. 
  What will happen to the "Belorussian" nuclear weapons next? 
The weapons and military hardware that are being withdrawn will 
be held at Strategic Missile Forces arsenals in Russia, where 
they will subsequently be used as an exchange fund to replace 
weapons that have reached the end of their service life in 
missile regiments on combat alert in Russia. 
  What does the future hold for the missile troops themselves? 
Lieutenant General Viktor Yesyan, chief of the Strategic Missile 
Forces Headquarters Operations Directorate, said that they would 
serve in Russian units that are currently undermanned. Officers 
and warrant officers who have expressed a desire to remain in 
Belorussia will be discharged from the ranks of the Russian 
Armed Forces. Their status has been defined by a special 
agreement between the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and 
the Republic of Belarus Ministry of Defense regarding the 
procedure for performance of military service by officers, 
ensigns, and warrant officers. This agreement has been approved 
by the Russian and Belarusian Governments and is being 
rigorously implemented. Officers and warrant officers who used 
to serve in the Strategic Missile Forces and who remain in 
Belorussia will enjoy all the rights of citizens of this 
republic. There have been no cases of encroachment on these 
rights.

<F P=106> [Michael Binyon report: "Kazakhstan Proposes Security </F>
Conference"] 
  [Text] President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan yesterday 
unveiled details of a proposal for an Asian security conference, 
a day after depositing with John Major his country's instruments 
of ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Speaking on the final working day of a visit to Britain, the 
leader of the largest former Soviet Central Asian republic said 
the proposed conference, modelled on the 1975 Helsinki accords, 
would attempt to set up new confidence-building measures at a 
time of rising tensions in Asia. 
  He said 27 nations had shown interest and Kazakhstan was 
going ahead with a preparatory conference to be attended by 
Deputy Foreign Ministers. Two meetings of experts had been 
held, and preparations were under way for a summit of heads of 
state. 
  Among those invited are all the former Soviet republics of 
Central Asia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, 
Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia. He hoped that Britain 
and other European nations could also be associated with the 
conference, and said Mr. Major had responded positively. 
  Kazakhstan is one of the world's only nuclear powers 
voluntarily to give up its weapons, having scrapped 1,100 
warheads. Britain, together with Russia and America, now has a 
formal role in guaranteeing the country's non-nuclear status. 
Much of Mr. Nazarbayev's visit here has been taken up with the 
rapidly expanding business links. New agreements were signed in 
Downing Street on double taxation, the protection of Western 
investments, economic cooperation, education and science. The 
Kazakh government is on the brink of signing a huge contract 
with British Gas.

  [Text] Almaty March 19 TASS -- U.S. Secretary of Defence 
William Perry, who is currently in Kazakhstan on a working 
visit, was received in the republican Ministry of Defence on 
Saturday. Mr Perry also attended a session of the joint 
Kazakhstan-American committee on defence industry conversion to 
civilian production. 
  The meetings, and the talks with President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev several hours earlier, resulted in the signing of an 
agreement on the conversion of the Kazakhstan defence industry 
to civilian production. 
  The agreement is actually a supplement to the earlier 
reached 
accord on the dismantling of the SS-18 missile silos and ensures 
an influx of an aggregate of 70 million U.S. dollars to the 
republic for defence industry conversion needs. 
  These documents are intended to ensure the dismantling of 
combat nuclear missile systems based in Kazakhstan and convert 
them to suit civilian and peaceful purposes, and additional 
training of the military personnel subject to demobilisation. 
  U.S. businesses are to be invited to help the defence 
industry conversion effort. In particular, a number of American 
companies will be involved in the reconstruction of appropriate 
enterprises for them to change over to the manufacture of 
consumer goods. 
  Mr. Perry and his party are to leave for Baykonur cosmodrome 
on March 20.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry is being 
received in Almaty today following his visit to Moscow. 
  Correspondent Dukesh Baimbetov: Today, after a 
meeting at the republic's Ministry of Defense, the American 
military delegation headed by William Perry was received by 
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. As is known, during 
the recent visit of Kazakhstan's leader to the United States the 
sides signed a number of documents between the two countries on 
economic, political, and military issues. 
  President Clinton and Vice President Gore have charged me 
with paying particular attention to the practical implementation 
of these programs, Perry said. Today, in particular, issues 
were discussed regarding the United States in the conversion of 
defense industry enterprises in Kazakhstan, inspecting the 
territory of the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, and the 
allocation of aid to its population. Incidentally, the first 
aid has already arrived. The Americans brought with them very 
valuable diagnostic equipment and medicines. They also spoke 
about tripartite space cooperation between Kazakhstan, the 
United States,and Russia. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Nazarbayev: There is nothing to delay on the part 
of the Kazakh side. At the present time we are holding talks 
with Russia. We hope that we will sign these agreements this 
month, in which all the issues will be agreed on. 
  We have reached agreement both with the United States and 
with Russia that Kazakhstan will be compensated for the cost of 
the highly enriched uranium that is in the warheads. [end

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, March 20 (TASS) -- On completing the 
official part of his Kazakh visit, U.S. Defence Secretary 
Willian Perry departed for the Baykonur cosmodrome from the 
Kazakh capital. 
  The secretary's visit to the cosmodrome is of a sight-seeing 
nature. However, the aims pursued by this trip are 
self-evident. The U.S. side is interested in studying Baykonur's 
possibilities with a view to U.S. participation in the use of 
its unique potential. 
  In the opinion of several local analysts, Kazakhstan tries 
to 
bring pressure on Russia by organising the U.S. defence 
secretary's visit to Baykonur. Several rounds of the 
Kazakh-Russian talks held in the recent past brought closer the 
positions of the sides. 
  However, they could not agree, for the time being, on the 
period of a lease and the amount of a lease payment. 
  Almaty believes that if the United States displays readiness 
for cooperation with the republic in the use of the cosmodrome, 
it will be possible to cut short the duration of its leasing to 
Russia and, consequently, to start earlier the establishment of 
an international space company or any other form of its 
utilisation on a multilateral basis. 
  Following the visit to Baykonur, Perry and his party will go 
to Kiev.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 23, BNS -- The Government Information 
Agency issued an explanatory statement Wednesday [23 March] on 
the March 15 agreement between Latvian and Russian negotiators 
on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, which forsees 
temporary operation of a radar station at Skrunda. 
  Russia has completely given up the idea to use the newest 
block of the radar station, according to the statement. The 
newest part of the compound will be transferred to the Latvian 
authority as soon as the withdrawal agreement is signed. 
  The United States has pledged Latvia 10 million USD needed 
to 
start the radar's dismantling. Russia, in its turn, promised to 
supply the equipment necessary to dismantle the newest block of 
the station. 
  Currently, the Skrunda early-warning antimissile radar 
occupies 1,008 hectares. After the agreement is signed, Latvia 
starts to control more than 80 percent of the territory. Russia 
continues its actitivities on 164 hectares of the total area for 
four years. 
  The draft agreement also forsees that Russia substitutes 
part 
of the radar's military personnel with civilians. The civil 
staff may be Latvian citizens and permanent residents. 
  Under the agreement, Russia should not change the functions 
or the equipment of the radar station. The "old" radar, built 
in late 1960's, is "morally and physically outdated," Soviet 
specialists said already in 1990. 
  Russia may even decide to suspend the operation of the 
costly 
and ineffective installation in view of its complicated domestic 
situation, the Latvian Government said in the statement. 
Moreover, Russia may start to use the Baranovici radar, which 
is still under construction, before the temporary operation term 
expires.

  [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Relations between Ukraine and 
the United States are strategically important, U.S. Defence 
Secretary William Perry said after talks with Ukrainian Defence 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy. 
  The two ministers discussed relations between the Ukrainian 
and American armed forces, the implementation of the Partnership 
for Peace programme and conversion plans, including housing 
construction for the demobilised military. 
  They also signed an agreement under which Ukraine will be 
granted 50 million dollars in addition to 135 million it is to 
receive under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The means 
will be used to finance the dismantlement of SS-24 missiles. 
  Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement 
signed in Moscow as a "historic move and a way-out of the 
nuclear deadlock." "This step and the ratification by Ukraine of 
the START-1 treaty and the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free 
state virtually removes all juridical and other barriers for 
Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty," he 
said. 
  At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of 
obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process." 
He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out 
disarmament and solving social problems facing the military. 
  "We have also reached full understanding on issues 
concerning 
the Partnership for Peace programme. We understand that 
Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures," 
Radetskyy said.

UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Petrunya] 
  [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Beginning May 30, 1994 Ukraine 
will no longer be a target for American strategic missiles, 
according to the agreements signed by the United States, Russia 
and Britain, ITAR-TASS and UKRINFORM learnt from well informed 
sources. 
  The sources said that this topic was discussed at the 
meeting 
between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and visiting U.S. 
Secretary of Defence William Perry which was held behind the 
closed doors. The major leitmotif of the talks was the 
implementation of the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement signed in 
Moscow in January 1994, as well as the agreements reached during 
the recent U.S.- Ukrainian summit meeting in Washington. They 
call for Ukraine's "denucliarisation" and providing it with 
compensations and security guarantees. 
  The second most important issue is cooperation between 
Ukraine and the United States within the programmes of economic 
cooperation and defence conversion. The U.S. will provide 
financial assistance to Ukraine to finance the conversion of its 
defence industry and build housing for the demobilised military. 
  Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine is unswervingly observing its 
obligations under the three-party agreement -- it has sent the 
second train full of nuclear warheads to Russia. 
  Perry stressed that relations between Ukraine and the United 
States are strategically important. He and Ukrainian Defence 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who also attended the talks signed an 
agreement under which Ukraine will be granted 50 million dollars 
in addition to 135 million it is to receive under the Strategic 
Arms Reduction Treaty. The means will be used to finance the 
dismantlement of SS-24 missiles. 
  Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement as a 
"historic move and a way-out of the nuclear deadlock." "This 
step and the ratification by Ukraine of the START-1 Treaty and 
the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free state virtually removes 
all juridical and other barriers for Ukraine's joining the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," he said. 
  At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of 
obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process." 
He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out 
disarmament and solving social problems facing the military. 
  "We have also reached full understanding on issues 
concerning 
the Partnership for Peace programme. We understand that 
Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures," 
Radetskyy said. 
  The sides also discussed cooperation in space exploration. 
The talks were attended by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William 
Miller.

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk is satisfied that the 
defense ministers of Ukraine and USA during recent talks 
"reached common positions on most issues which today can be 
resolved," Kravchuk said at a meeting with Pentagon Chief 
Willian Perry on Monday. 
  Kravchuk also said: "There are issues which cannot be 
resolved today, but gradually they can be resolved if there is 
willingness to do so." 
  On the same day the defense ministers of the two countries 
Vitaly Radetsky and William Perry signed an agreement on 
additional U.S. aid to Ukraine for the liquidation of nuclear 
weapons. 
  As Perry told journalists after the signing ceremony, 
Ukraine 
will be given an additional $50 million for the dismantling of 
nuclear arms. In December last year the USA granted $135 
million to Ukraine for that purpose. 
  Noting that cooperation between the two countries is very 
important in the strategical aspect, Perry stressed the 
particular significance of interaction between the military 
ministries of Ukraine and the USA. 
  Perry said that an agreement was also reached on "frequent 
and close" ties between the general headquarters and leaders of 
the military ministries of the two countries. 
  Radetsky called the fact that with the U.S. and Russian help 
Ukraine managed to get out of a nuclear stalemate and sign a 
trilateral Moscow statement on the liquidation of nuclear 
weapons on its territory "a historic step." He said all 
obstacles to Ukraine's joining the treaty on non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons had been eliminated. 
  Radetsky pointed out that developing cooperation between 
Ukraine and the USA promotes both global and regional security. 
  At a meeting on the same day Perry and Ukrainian 
Vice-Premier 
Valery Shamrov decided to charge experts with preparing an 
agreement or a communique which would reflect a common position 
of Ukraine and the USA on nuclear disarmament and cooperation in 
the space and rocket field. 
  Chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary commission on 
defense 
and state security issues Valentin Lemish told journalists that 
probably a bilateral commission will be formed to control the 
disarmament process in Ukraine.

UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Balykov] 
  [Text] Kiev March 22 TASS -- U.S. Defence Secretary William 
Perry has been the first foreign defence minister to visit a 
strategic missile unit in Pervomaysk, Ukraine, and a classified 
military plant in Dnepropetrovsk. 
  Ukraine ranks the world's third in the number of nuclear 
warheads stationed on its territory. It is preceded only by the 
United States and Russia. Two types of missiles are stationed 
in Pervomaysk, the Nikolayev region. Part of missiles have been 
dismantled. 
  The U.S. Pentagon head visited a dismantled missile silo to 
see a deactivated SS-24 missile. The secretary was told by 
Ukrainian servicemen that warheads have been removed from 30 
SS-24 missiles and eleven SS-19 missiles. All in all, this will 
be done to 46 SS- 24 and 30 SS-19 missiles. 
  Last year Ukrainian specialists took off duty two regiments 
of strategic missiles. One of them to include ten systems was 
withdrawn from Pervomaysk. Nuclear warheads have been 
dismantled and sent to technical storages, missiles have been 
removed from silos, fuel and oxidizer were put into special 
tanks, loaded into freight cars and set to the Yuzhmash plant in 
Dnepropetrovsk. 
  The U.S. defence secretary visited the Yuzhmash plant, which 
earlier produced the world's only high-precision heavy missiles 
capable to deliver up to ten warheads of megaton weight. The 
plant and its design bureau produced four generations of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and made the first 
artificial earth satellite of the Cosmos series together with 
the rocket booster. 
  Now the plant continues to produce space equipment, 
simultaneously with first Ukrainian trolley-buses and wind 
engines.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told 
journalists on his return from a trip to Warsaw and Brussels 
that he shares the opinion of the Ukrainian defense minister 
about the possible adjustment of the timetable for the 
withdrawal of warheads from Ukraine. 
  In response to a question by the Interfax-Ukraine news 
agency, Zlenko said that "all signatories of the statement on 
nuclear disarmament of Ukraine should fulfil their obligations." 
  Earlier this week Ukrainian leaders stated that Ukraine may 
suspend the withdrawal of warheads unless Russia starts 
transportation of nuclear fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power 
stations. 
  "We are entitled to issue a statement and take corresponding 
measures in order to fulfil obligations assumed under the 
trilateral statement," Zlenko said. 
  Asked about the U.S. role in the fulfillment of obligations 
under the statement, Zlenko said: "We are talking about equal 
partnership. Each side should assume equal obligations."

<F P=106> ["Delayed NPT Accedence Hampers Ukraine's International </F>
space Research Cooperation" -- UKRINFORM headline; From the 
"Business News Weekly" feature No. 12, March 14-20 94] 
  [Text] On March 20 and several days on, a team of NASA 
experts is supposed to work in Kiev within the framework of U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to Ukraine. 
  Vladimir Gorbulin, director-general of the Ukrainian 
National 
Space Agency, believes that a NASA-UNSA dialogue will rule out 
bilateral cooperation in what involves space rocketry 
manufacture, because of Ukraine's failure to accede to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  According to Mr. Gorbulin, Ukraine with its unique space 
rocketry technologies lost a year when its parliament refused to 
accede to NPT, while Russia managed to establish large-scale 
international cooperation in space research, primarily with the 
USA. 
  The Ukrainian National Space Agency together with the 
Ministry for foreign economic relations have been mustering 
support for Ukraine's prompt accedence to NPT. 
  During its crucial talks with NASA officers UNSA intends to 
discuss likely opportunities for joining efforts in Earth remote 
probing, satellite telecommunications and similar domains. 
  The Ukrainian side reportedly intends to offer NASA its 
side-vision radars for scanning oceanic surfaces, which were 
designed by the Yuzhnoye (Southern) designers, and the Paton 
Institute's technologies for arc welding and construction 
assembly in space. 
  Following the USSR's collapse Ukraine's space industry has 
sustained heavy losses. In particular, the Yuzhnoye designers 
personnel reduced by 3,000 over the two last years. (Mr. 
Gorbulin refused to specify the number of personnel currently 
employed by the Yuzhnoye Bureau, saying only the personnel loss 
was tremendous). 
  Luckily enough, as Mr. Gorbulin hastened to add, there has 
been no brain-drain in that case, since the relieved personnel 
remains in Ukraine.

  [Text] Before the forthcoming parliamentary elections in 
Ukraine, several important parties there are demanding that, 
despite previous agreements, the country should retain some of 
its nuclear weapons. "The Echo" program correspondent Kjell 
Albin Abrahamson reports from Ukraine. 
  Abrahamson: Today Yeltsin is governing Russia, but 
tomorrow Zhirinovskiy may come to power. Today President 
Clinton is supporting Ukraine, but we know nothing about the 
next U.S. President. This was said by Ukrainian General 
(Oleksandr Rul), who will stand as a candidate of the 
super-nationalist Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in the 
parliamentary elections. He now sees nationalism and nuclear 
weapons as the best guarantee for an independent and sovereign 
Ukraine. 
  Most political parties here share that view, including the 
Republican Party -- an offshoot of the dissident movement -- and 
the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, which want Ukraine to 
retain some of its nearly 1,800 nuclear warheads. General (Rul) 
points out: It is us, not you who are in the immediate 
frontline in the event of a Russian attack. 
<H5>  START Provisions Discussed, Dependence on Nuclear Weapons </H5>
Denied 
<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Serhiy Zhurets: </F>
"Nuclear Weapons for Ukraine Are Like a Suitcase for a Drowning 
Man--Both Too Heavy to Hold, and a Pity to Let Go"] 
  [Text] That which we have long been waiting for has come. 
The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has finally decided to define its 
attitude toward the trilateral declaration of the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States and Russia. As official sources have 
indicated more than once, this document proclaims the removal of 
nuclear weapons from Ukraine and defines the mechanism for 
compensation and security guarantees for our nation. 
  All of the nuclear warheads, according to the trilateral 
declaration, will be removed from the territory of Ukraine to 
Russia for their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible 
time. Russia will provide compensation in the form of 
deliveries of fuel rods for the requirements of Ukrainian 
nuclear power engineering. 
  Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear 
weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its 
territory within seven years, and all of the SS-24 missiles will 
be deactivated within ten months through the removal of their 
nuclear charges. 
  Russia will in turn guarantee the technical servicing and 
safe operation of the nuclear warheads. The United States will 
provide technical and financial assistance for the reliable and 
safe dismantling of the nuclear weapons. 
  Everything that is contained in the trilateral declaration 
and the addendum to the declaration, from the point of view of 
President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, conforms to the 
requirements posed by the Supreme Soviet regarding ratification 
of the START-1 treaty and satisfies the restrictions advanced by 
the people's deputies. There were 13 such restrictions, and 
they talked chiefly about the aforementioned security guarantees 
and the granting of financial and technical assistance directed 
toward the elimination of the nuclear arsenal. 
  Life has confirmed once again, however, that there are as 
many ideas as there are people. And when we are talking about 
politicians, then they could have even more. 
  There were meetings the day before the recent session of the 
Supreme Soviet by the commissions on questions of defense and 
national security, questions of legislation and legality, 
foreign affairs and the working deputies' commission to study 
the START-1 treaty. The aim of the session was to prepare 
findings regarding the conformity of the trilateral declaration 
signed on January 14 in Moscow. Since there was not a quorum at 
the session, they did not come to any unified findings, but each 
commission came to its own findings separately. Since it would 
be out of place to cite those findings, we will address the 
results of the working commission to study the START-1 treaty. 
  According to the statement by President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk, the members of that commission indicate, he has 
confirmed his "commitment to the fact that Ukraine join the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT] as a state not 
possessing nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time." The 
Supreme Soviet, at the same time, had earlier considered Ukraine 
to be the possessor of nuclear weapons, and only the realization 
of START-1 "would open up the way for the resolution by the 
Supreme Soviet of Ukraine of the question of joining the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty." 
  Another detail is connected with the fact that the 
trilateral 
declaration indicates that "Ukraine will provide for the 
destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic 
offensive weapons, deployed on its territory," even though the 
Supreme Soviet has stipulated the destruction of only 36 percent 
of the missile delivery systems and 42 percent of the nuclear 
warheads. Moreover, this presidential wording obligates Ukraine 
to destroy not only all nuclear weapons within seven years, but 
also all strategic offensive weapons along with their 
infrastructure. After all, as was indicated on this score in a 
memorandum of the U.S. embassy, "any preservation of deployed 
SS-24 ICBMs after the seven-year period of cutbacks under the 
START treaty would be in contradiction to the obligations of 
Ukraine, whether those missiles are fitted with nuclear or 
conventional warheads," and the United States "will not agree to 
any weakening of this obligation." This categorical American 
attitude signifies that the prospects for the creation of 
high-precision weaponry with conventional warheads based on the 
SS-24 delivery system as a means of strategic deterrence are 
quite uncertain. 
  The terms of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, 
financing for inspection activities, the possibility of using 
launch silos for peaceful purposes, the use of weapons-grade 
plutonium, and expenditures for the social support of officers 
and warrant officers of the missile forces who will be 
discharged from the army owing to the cutbacks all remain 
uncertain in the trilateral declaration. 
  I am citing all of these contradictions in great detail in 
order to give a better sense of the tension that was present in 
the hall of the Supreme Soviet during the discussion of the 
trilateral declaration, the ratification of the START-1 treaty 
and the joining of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 
speeches by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of 
Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy 
Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko 
stressed once again the fact that nuclear weapons are no 
guarantee of security for us, we are not able to maintain them, 
and to go against the world opinion, even if you are correct, is 
a hopeless matter. Nuclear weapons for Ukraine, in the current 
economic difficulties, are almost a suitcase for a drowning man 
-- too heavy to hold on to, but a shame to let go of. 
  The fate of the nuclear weapons stationed on the territory 
of 
Ukraine was resolved in two hours of discussion by the two 
paragraphs of a Decree of the Supreme Soviet, namely: 
  1. Bearing in mind the specific steps taken by the President 
and Government of Ukraine with regard to the fulfillment of the 
provisions of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 18 November 
1993 and the reciprocal steps on the part of the United States 
and Russia, to remove the restrictions with regard to Article 5 
of the Protocol to the START Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on 
23 May 1993. 
  2. To authorize the Government of Ukraine to exchange 
letters 
on the ratification of the START-1 treaty and to make more 
active the actions of the Government to reach a concrete 
agreement that flows out of the restrictions of the Supreme 
Soviet regarding the ratification of the START-1 Treaty. 
  What do the two paragraphs of this short decree mean? 
  First, that very difficult and painstaking work lies ahead. 
At least five treaties or agreements will have to be reached, 
which translate or at least should translate the declarative 
substance of many provisions of the trilateral declaration into 
the area of concrete, detailed and documented mutual 
obligations. This pertains first and foremost to a schedule for 
the dispatch of the first lot of nuclear warheads to Russia, an 
agreement pertaining to the procedure and conditions for 
monitoring their dismantling and salvaging on the part of 
Ukraine, an agreement on compensation for the value of the 
nuclear weapons transferred to Russia, and an agreement on 
guarantor's and originator's oversight of the status of the 
warheads that are still in Ukraine, including their transport to 
"S" facilities and plant yards. 
  Second, that it is still too soon to put a period to the 
resolution of the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed in 
Ukraine, since a thing or two remains that is not entirely clear 
or resolved. Although the removal of the restrictions pertaining 
to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol also envisages Ukraine's 
joining in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after all, the 
deputies were still disinclined to the possibility during the 
voting. Ukraine, under legal canons, does not have the slightest 
right to demand compensation for strategic and tactical nuclear 
weapons in joining the NNPT. The United States and Russia, 
however, as indicated in the trilateral declaration, will 
provide Kiev with security guarantees only in the event Ukraine 
joins the NNPT. So the circle closes. And only time will tell 
what the way out of this legal-political stalemate will be...

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Knysh: "`Not a Sensation...'"] </F>
  [Text] IZVESTIYA of February 22 of this year published an 
article by the newspaper's military correspondent, Viktor 
Lytovkin, under the title "RVSN [Strategic Missile Forces] 
Command Disavows Responsibility for the Security of 
Nuclear-Missile Armaments in Ukraine." Referring to 
confidential sources in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the 
author cites the content of an official letter of the 
commander-in-chief of the strategic missile forces, 
Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev, to Minister of Defense of Russia 
General of the Army Pavel Grachev. 
  The article, with reference to this letter, discussed the 
fact that "under the prevailing circumstances Russia can in no 
way have any impact on the security of the nuclear-missile 
weaponry in Ukraine and its non-sanctioned employment." This is 
connected with the decision of the commander of the 43rd Missile 
Army, Colonel-General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, the commander of the 
46th Missile Division, Major-General N. Filatov, and their 
subordinates to take the oath of loyalty to the people of 
Ukraine. It also talked about the "gross violation of the 
Agreement on the Status of Strategic Forces" signed by the heads 
of the CIS and the like. 
  The facts set forth in the article were commented on at a 
briefing at the MZS [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] by Deputy 
Minister of Defense Ivan Bizhan and Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Borys Tarasyuk. 
  It was pointed out in particular that the Minister of 
Defense 
of Ukraine does not need to coordinate his actions with the head 
of the Russian military agency. Assertions that the command of 
the RVSN of Russia have been deprived of the possibility of 
exercising operational command and control over the troops of 
the 43rd Missile Army were categorized as a fabrication. The 
operational control remains with Russia, and Ukraine has in no 
way disrupted it and does not intend to do so, emphasized 
Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan. 
  The presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States 
signed a Declaration in Moscow on January 14. The appearance of 
this article has thus elicited, at the very least, surprise. 
  The fact was stated in particular that no one forced the 
commander of the 43rd Missile Army, Colonel-General V. Mykhtyuk, 
and the commander of the 46th Missile Division, Major-General N. 
Filatov, to take the oath of loyalty to the people of Ukraine. 
The generals, as well as the other officers, did this entirely 
voluntarily. Assertions of some gross violation of the 
agreement on the status of the strategic forces were categorized 
as untrue, because CIS strategic forces do not exist. As 
Colonel-General I. Bizhan reported, Russia unilaterally 
subordinated all of the units of the Strategic Missile Forces to 
itself in the summer of 1992. It is thus impossible to violate 
an agreement on something that does not exist. 
  The manpower levels of the units of the 43rd Army are at 85 
percent for officers and almost 100 percent for conscript 
servicemen. The high-quality officer corps thus permits the 
complete fulfillment of the tasks of combat duty and the 
maintenance of nuclear security. 
  The press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine 
made a statement with regard to this feature that emphasized, in 
particular, the steadfast upholding by our country of all 
international agreements signed by it.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- According to 
Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the joint 
Ukrainian-Japanese committee for cooperation in the elimination 
of Ukraine's nuclear arms held its first meeting on 21 March. 
UNIAN has already reported that this committee was set up in 
accordance with an agreement between the Governments of Ukraine 
and Japan on cooperation in nuclear arms elimination. 
  Valeriy Pavlyukov, deputy minister of machine-building, 
military-industrial complex, and conversion was appointed to 
represent Ukraine on the board of the committee, and Shoji 
Suezawa, the Japanese ambassador to Ukraine, was appointed as 
Japan's representative. In accordance with Article 5 of the 
agreement, the Japanese side has appointed Japanese Foreign 
Ministry official Tojiuki Kawakami as technical secretariat 
director. 
  At the meeting, the main targets of Japan's aid to Ukraine 
were discussed. The Japanese side emphasized that the Japanese 
Government will allocate funds for Ukraine's aid programs in 
strategic nuclear arms elimination before the end of March 1994. 
The amount of aid will be announced later. In the meantime, 
Ukraine is to put forward specific projects to be funded in the 
near future.

  [Text] Brussels, March 22, RIA -- According to a diplomatic 
source in the Eurocommission, the unexpected opposition of 
France at the bilateral consultations with Russia on the 
delivery of enriched uranium to the European market might block 
the signing of the agreement on Russo-EU partnership and 
cooperation. 
  Previously, the EU delegation demanded that the imports of 
unenriched uranium from Russia should be kept back, which 
hindered the talks. But at the last week's meeting in Paris the 
French delegation stated that the deliveries of Russian 
unenriched uranium were not the problem. Instead, France 
suggested, Russia's quotas for the delivery of enriched uranium 
should be halved. 
  A diplomat working with the Eurocommission said that if 
Russia accepted this proposal, this would create panic among the 
users of Russian uranium in Germany, Britain, Belgium and some 
other EU countries, which opted for priority development of 
nuclear engineering. The protectionist attitude of France put 
in question the signing of a multilateral agreement with the 
European Energy Charter, already signed by Russia, France and 
the EU.

<F P=106> ["hll" report: "SPD Wants to Be `Protective Power'"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 18 March -- In their draft of a government 
program, which was presented on Friday [18 March], the Social 
Democrats present themselves as a "strong protective power" for 
the social interests of families and for those at a material 
disadvantage, in particular in eastern Germany. In addition, 
they announce that they will act against disturbances of 
peaceful coexistence with "determination and consistency." 
  In order to combat organized crime, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] wants to have assets impounded if there 
"is the urgent and justified suspicion that they come from 
serious crime or are to be used for such crimes, unless the 
owner proves the opposite." If all other methods fail, the 
authorities "must have the right to mount microphones in 
apartments and to record conversations," which, however, is to 
be linked with strict preconditions. 
  The SPD also wants to "strengthen the presence of police in 
streets and squares." Combating right-wing extremism as well as 
the integration of foreigners are cited as focal issues. 
  Regarding energy policy, the draft program sticks to the 
goal 
of opting out of nuclear energy, but it does not give a schedule 
for it: "We want to set a course toward opting out of nuclear 
energy by replacing the nuclear law with a further developed law 
on opting out of nuclear energy." Just as the current coalition 
government, the SPD wants to reduce the emission of carbon 
dioxide by one-fourth by the year 2005. German hard coal and 
brown coal are to be used as ongoing energy supplies and the use 
of hard coal is to be financially secured also beyond the year 
2000. 
  As for foreign policy, Germany's co-responsibility for 
worldwide problems is stressed under the keyword "partnership 
for development and peace." The draft notes: "No Bundeswehr 
participation in wars" but only in peacekeeping and humanitarian 
missions. It demands "restrictive European arms export 
controls." Europe must become an "environmental and social 
union." 
  The government program will be finally adopted by the SPD 
congress in Halle on 22 June. The authors of the draft, the 
size of which has doubled compared with earlier versions, are 
convinced that the majority of the party agrees with their 
statements.

<F P=106> [Skjalg Fremo report: "Ban Adopted -- And Forgotten"] </F>
  [Text] Trondheim -- The amendment to the law was meant to 
prohibit Norwegians from acting as intermediaries for sales of 
arms and military equipment from one foreign country to another 
without special permission. 
  The amendment to the law was adopted by the Stortinget 
[Norwegian Parliament] in spring 1990 following rapid 
consideration. However, a formal error in its processing by the 
government meant that the ban first took effect last Friday. 
  The acting press spokesman for the Norwegian Department of 
Foreign Affairs (UD), Arthur Baste Knutsen, told us that the 
fact that the law has only just come into force had no practical 
meaning. 
  "Since the summer the law was adopted, there have not been 
any cases where this legal provision has come into play," Baste 
Knutsen said. 
<H5>  Slip in Minutes </H5>
  The statutory provision, which has not been in application 
for three-and-a-half years after all, is contained in the law 
governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, 
services, and technology. The Lovdata [legal data] organization 
discovered the formal error, which appears to have been made 
when the new provision was meant to be approved by the king at 
the cabinet meeting held on 22 June 1990. The law was indeed 
approved that day, and the intention was to implement it 
straight away. 
  However, this latter provision was omitted from the minutes 
of the cabinet meeting, probably by error. Consequently, the 
entry into force of the law was not announced in the NORWEGIAN 
LAW NEWS, Lovdata revealed in a letter to the Department of 
Foreign Affairs. 
<H5>  Arms Intermediaries </H5>
  The background to the amendment of the law was an actual 
case 
that came to light in the winter of 1990 when a Norwegian 
company acted as an intermediary selling arms from one country 
to another. The Justice Department discovered that the law in 
force at the time failed to give the Norwegian authorities any 
authority to intervene against such activities -- because it was 
not a question of selling arms, but rather merely acting as an 
intermediary for arms sales. 
  Kjell Magne Bondevik, the foreign minister at the time, 
reacted quickly to close this loophole in a law dating from 1987 
governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, 
services, and technology. Under the provisions of this law, 
Norwegian citizens must have a special approval to sell arms, 
while simple mediation was not affected. 
  The UD issued a proposal for an amendment to the law on 6 
April 1990. The proposal was adopted by the cabinet that same 
day, and the matter was passed on to the Stortinget. 
  The Norwegian parliament also reacted swiftly. The Committee 
on Foreign Affairs, led by [Prime Minister] Gro Harlem 
Brundtland, issued a unanimously adopted recommendation on 3 May 
1990. Odelstinget [larger division of Norwegian parliament] 
passed a unanimous resolution on 21 May 1990, and Lagtinget 
[smaller division of Norwegian parliament] confirmed this on 29 
May 1990. 
  Evidently, everyone agreed that the mediation of arms sales 
should be monitored. Accordingly, the amendment to the law 
should have been approved by the king in the cabinet. The bill 
states that: "This law shall take effect from a moment to be 
stipulated by the king." In a letter sent to the UD on 18 
February 1994, Lovdata pointed out that no decision had ever 
been made on its entry into force. Consequently, up until now 
it was lawful for Norwegian citizens to act as intermediaries in 
arms sales between one country and another, in direct 
contravention of Stortinget's 1990 resolution.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris </F>
Krivoshey and Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar -- The decision by the U.S. President 
to prolong the nuclear test moratorium for another year, up to 
September 1995, has been met with satisfaction in Russia. This 
was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of 
the department of information and the press of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry. 
  He stressed that Russia's position on this question remained 
unchanged. We were the initiators of the trilateral moratorium 
on nuclear tests, which is being observed de facto by Britain, 
too, and we recently stated once again our intention of 
continuing to adhere to it. At the same time we called on the 
other nuclear countries to do the same, the spokesman of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry stated. 
  In connection with this, he recalled that during the 
Russian-U.S. summit meeting in Moscow, Presidents Boris Yeltsin 
and Bill Clinton confirmed Russia's and the United States' 
commitment to achieving within a very short period an 
international treaty on the total banning of nuclear tests. 
Karasin also noted the constructive atmosphere at the talks on 
this question, which are taking place at the disarmament 
conference in Geneva.

  [Text] Wellington, March 17 (AFP) -- New Zealand Thursday 
welcomed a United States decision to extend its moratorium on 
nuclear testing for another year and called on China to take 
similar action. 
  On Wednesday President Bill Clinton advised congress that 
the 
moratorium would be extended a year until September 1995. 
  Foreign Minister Don McKinnon welcomed the decision, saying 
it meant Clinton regarded worldwide restraint on testing as 
important in making progress in nuclear non-proliferation. 
  "New Zealand agrees," he said in a statement. "I hope other 
nuclear weapon states which have suspended testing programmes 
will be reassured by the U.S. decision. I think we can take it 
that existing moratoria will be maintained. 
  "China still has to agree to a moratorium. 
  "It would be fitting for China to show restraint at a time 
when the world has justified expectations of an end to the 
development of these terrible weapons," McKinnon said.

  [Text] Paris, March 15 (AFP) -- France Tuesday welcomed 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to extend a moratorium on 
nuclear tests until September 1995, a spokesman for President 
Francois Mitterrand said. 
  The "decision by the U.S. President is one of the 
consequences of our own decision (to extend a moratorium on 
French testing)," the spokesman said. "We are happy to see that 
this decision is confirmed." 
  "All this moves in a desirable direction at a time when we 
are preparing to discuss the extension of the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty in 1995 and when we have begun talks in 
Geneva on banning nuclear weapons," the source said. 
  The current U.S. moratorium was to run out at the end of 
this 
September.

1995, Mr. Mircea Geoana, spokesman of the Romanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, today declared the following: 
  Romania salutes the decision that encourages the achievement 
of the goals of non-proliferation -- above all, the 
unconditioned prolongation over an indefinite period of time of 
the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons -- as 
well as the negotiations currently taking place at the Geneva 
disarmament conference on a total ban on nuclear tests. 
  We express our hope that in concordance with the efforts 
made 
by the international community to strengthen the current 
juridical instruments and institutions set up to prevent the 
spreading of mass destruction weapons, all other nuclear powers 
will take measures similar to those adopted by the U.S. party, 
the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, Press Association Defence </F>
Correspondent] 
  [Text] The Government tonight insisted it had no plans to 
test nuclear weapons following the United States' announcement 
of an 18-month extension to its testing moratorium until 
September, 1995. 
  President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the 
restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure 
to resume testing in response to China's test last October. 
  White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr. Clinton was 
concerned about the impact resumed U.S. nuclear tests would have 
on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January. 
  Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its 
nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium 
extension was not unexpected. 
  "We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the 
United 
States' moratorium continues," said a Foreign Office spokesman. 
  "And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with 
energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear 
test ban treaty." 
  When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear 
testing in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three 
tests were planned on Trident warheads "for safety reasons". 
  But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world 
opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop 
computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts. 
  The need for testing in any case has eased after the 
Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic 
nuclear missile. 
  Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles 
fitted with single warheads. 
  Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the 
Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be 
fitted with the same warhead. 
  However, Britain is retaining its capability to design, 
develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.

  [Editorial Report] 
Russia has signed a long-term lease with Kazakhstan for 
rights to the 
Baykonur Cosmodrome. However, the commander of Russia's 
Military-Space 
Forces is advocating development of a new cosmodrome at a former 
ICBM base 
on Russian territory. The new facility would use converted 
55-19 missiles 
to orbit light payloads as well as a new Russian heavy 
booster. 
<H5>  Agreement Signed on Baykonur </H5>
  On 28 March Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed a 
series 
of bilateral agreements in Moscow. Among the documents was a 
leasing arrangement for the Baykonur Cosmodrome arrived at after 
weeks of intense negotiations. Under its terms Russia will 
lease the cosmodrome from Kazakhstan for a 20-year period with 
an option for a ten-year renewal. Baykonur will be under 
Russian sovereignty and Russians working at the cosmodrome will 
be subject to Russian legal jurisdiction. Russia will also be 
permitted to station its Military-Space Forces at the cosmodrome 
to conduct space launch operations. The agreement also 
recognizes Russia's property rights to all cosmodrome facilities 
in place as of 31 August 1991 (TRUD 30 Mar). 
  Russia agreed to pay an annual leasing fee of $115 million 
(ITAR-TASS 28 Mar). At the exchange rate as of the signing 
date, the annual fee would be over R2OO billion. According to 
press reports the leasing fee was a compromise between the 
Russian offer of $80 million and the Kazakh demand for $150 
million (INTERFAX 28 Mar). Kazakhstan had reportedly offered a 
lease term of only three to five years while the original 
Russian position was for a thirty-year term. The Kazakhs' 
demand for $7 billion compensation for environmental damages 
caused by past comodrome operations was relegated to a special 
bilateral commission for discussion as a separate issue 
(INTERFAX 14 Mar, 20 Mar). 
<H5>  Alternatives to Baykonur </H5>
  With the breakup of the Soviet Union the Baykonur Cosmodrome 
became the property of Kazakhstan. Basic questions concerning 
Russian rights to the facilities, the status of the Russian 
Military-Space units staffing Baykonur, and the financing of the 
cosmodrome and its associated city of Leninsk remained 
unresolved. Despite a May 1992 agreement on financing of the 
cosmodrome signed by Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev, numerous 
media reports have indicated a sharp deterioration in conditions 
and losses of skilled personnel. Some commentators have raised 
the question of whether Baykonur can continue to operate if the 
situation did not improve. 
  Creation of a new space launch complex for military and 
civil use on Russian territory as a replacement for Baykonur has 
been under consideration. In May 1993 the Russian government 
was reportedly examining a proposal made by the high command of 
the Military-Space Forces together with the Russian Space Agency 
to create a new cosmodrome in Russia. Locations under 
consideration at that time included Krasnoyarsk Kray and the 
Kapustin Yar Missile Test Range (K0MMERSANT DAILY 22 May 93). 
In December 1993 a statute issued by the Russian Government and 
Council of Ministers set forth provisions for state support and 
maintenance of space activities in Russia (Statute No. 1282, 
dated 11 Dec 93, published in R0SSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 29 Dec 93). 
The statute set Russian autonomy in space operations as a basic 
strategic goal. Among its provisions was a directive to the 
Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian Space Agency, and other 
national Ministries to draw up proposals for upgrading Russia's 
northern cosmodrome at Plesetsk and for construction of a new 
cosmodrome in the Russian Far East. 
  In February of this year media reports indicated that the 
city of Blagoveshchensk in Amur 0blast was being considered as a 
cosmodrome site. The First Deputy Director of the Russian Space 
Agency (RSA) Valeriy Alaverdov stated that the project was for 
the distant future and that Russia was doing everything possible 
to ensure that Baykonur remained operational (R0SSIYSKIYE VESTI 
10 Mar). However, General Vladimir Ivanov, commander of Russian 
Military-Space Forces, claimed that a Far East launch center 
would be operational by the year 2000 (INTERFAX 9 Mar). 
<H5>  Svobodnyy-18 ICBN Base </H5>
  In a speech in early March the head of the Amur 0blast 
administration claimed that the Russian government was seriously 
considering a launch facility at the city of Svobodnyy, located 
about 200 kilometers north of Blagoveshchensk, and urged 
President Yeltsin to issue a directive to proceed with 
construction at the site (IZVESTIYA 12 Mar). The site in 
question is the Svobodnyy-18 ICBM base. On 15 March, General 
Ivanov, headed a delegation of more than sixty military and 
civilian aerospace experts on a tour of the former Strategic 
Missile Forces base at Svobodnyy-18. Speaking to leaders of the 
Amur region, Ivanov claimed that the first test flights from the 
Svobodnyy site are planned for 1996 (INTERFAX 16 Mar). 
  Proponents of the plan claimed that use of missile silos and 
other facilities of the former Svobodnyy-18 ICBM base would make 
it possible to begin launch operations quickly and with 
relatively low costs for site development. Major-General 
Aleksandr Vinidiktov, the former commander of the Strategic 
Missile troops at Svobodnyy-18 and now designated as commander 
of the Svobodnyy Cosmodrome, claimed that virtually no 
government funding would be needed to begin space launch 
operations at the site (ITAR- TASS 18 Mar). According to this 
plan, silos, originally built for 55-11 ICBMs and now scheduled 
for destruction under the START-2 Treaty, could be modified for 
launching the "Rokot" space launch vehicle (SLV). The Rokot is 
one of several conversion projects involving modification of 
ICBMs for use as space launchers. "Rokot" is the designation 
for such a conversion of the 55-19 ICBM. Under this scenario, 
two silos would be used initially to launch light payloads with 
the Rokot SLV, which has been claimed to have a payload capacity 
of two metric tons to a 500 km orbit (K0MMERSANT DAILY 7 Apr 
93). Three additional silos would then be activated for Rokot 
launches and two launch pads for heavy SLVs would be constructed 
(ITAR-TASS 17 Mar 
94). 
  Officials in the Russian government and the Russian Space 
Agency reacted negatively to the proposed development of 
Svobodnyy and emphasized that no official government approval 
has been given for such a project. According to Boris Ostroumov, 
Deputy General Director of the Russian Space Agency, any 
potential advantages of the Svobodnyy site would be more than 
offset by its remoteness from the primary research and 
production facilities of Russia's space infrastructure. In 
Ostroumov's formulation, construction of a major space launch 
site in the Far East would be "tantamount to building it out of 
diamonds" (IZVESTIYA 12 Mar). Given the restricted national 
space budget, the RSA argued for maintaining existing facilities 
and trying to reach an acommodation with Kazakhstan on Baykonur. 
  While Svobodnyy's location in eastern Siberia presents 
problems, its latitudinal position is a point in it favor. 
Lying somewhat further north than Baykonur (51 24 N versus 47 
50 N) it is situated in the southernmost region of Russian 
Federation territory, a basic consideration for launches to 
equatorial or low-inclination orbits. A further advantage of the 
location in the Russian Far East was said to be the possibility 
that such a facility could open the way for Russia to enter the 
developing market for space launch services in Southeast Asia 
(IZVESTIYA 12 Mar). 
  On 23 March Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets denied reports that construction had begun on a new 
cosmodrome in the Far East and stated that the matter was not 
under discussion in the government. He went on to say "We are 
unable to ensure the normal functioning of the available launch 
pads, not to mention building a new one". Soskovets' position 
was supported by Yuriy Semenov, head of NPO Energiya, who stated 
that Russia would not be able to retain the status of a space 
power if it lost the Baykonur Cosmodrome (ITAR-TASS World 
Service 23 Mar). Semenov described the current situation at 
Baykonur as "catastrophic" and claimed that the cosmodrome would 
cease operating unless remedial actions were started by 
April. 
<H5>  Angara-24 Heavy Launcher </H5>
  A replacement for the Baykonur Cosmodrome would have to 
include a capacity for launching heavy SLVs. Russia currently 
has no facilities for heavy launchers at its northern cosmodrome 
at Plesetsk. Launch facilities for the Zenit (SL-16), Proton 
(SL-12, -13), and Energiya (SL-17) boosters are available only 
at Baykonur and all manned flight missions are launched from 
there. Russian space launches supporting the Alpha 
international space station program would have to be conducted 
from Baykonur. 
  Commentators have referred to a new Russian heavy launcher, 
designated "Angara-24", as the SLV that would be launched from 
two pads to be built at the Svobodnyy facility. These are the 
first references to such a booster to appear in Russian media. 
However, in mid-1993 a French aerospace journal reported a 
Russian plan to consolidate its SLV inventory to only four types 
by the end of the century. The "Angara" was to be one of the 
four Russian SLVs. According to the French report, the Angara 
would be an "improved Zenit" that would be manufactured in 
Russia and replace the current Zenit produced in Ukraine 
(See FBIS PERSPECTIVES Vol 8 No 8, August 1993). 
  According to the current references the two-stage 
"Angara-24" 
will combine elements from both the Zenit and the Energiya-Buran 
systems as well as new design features. It will use relatively 
non-polluting kerosene and LOX-hydrogen propellants. The head 
of the Military-Space Forces press center claimed in an 
interview that the Angara would be more powerful than the Proton 
(Mayak Radio Network 26 Mar 94). The first stage will be 
designed to make a gliding return to the launch site and be 
reused. First flight tests are scheduled for 1998-1999 with 
operational launches from Svobodnyy to begin around 2000-2001 
(ITAR-TASS 16 Mar). The Angara is reported to be under 
development by NPO Energiya, the Khrunichev Scientific 
Production Center, and the Makeyev Design Bureau in Miass, 
Chelyabinsk oblast (SEGODNYA 24 Mar). 
  In an interview given just before the announcement of the 
leasing agreement on Baykonur, Lt-Col Gorbunov of the Russian 
Military-Space Forces press center responded to a suggestion 
that the publicity devoted to building a new Russian cosmodrome 
in the Far East was a tactic to put pressure on the Kazakh side 
in the negotiations. He responded that politics was not 
involved, but rather the basic goal of Russia's guaranteed 
access to space, especially to launches to geostationary orbits, 
currently performed only from Baykonur (Radiostantsiya Ekho 
Moskvy 28 Mar). At the end of March a Moscow press report 
claimed that work was proceeding on the Angara-24 project and 
that it will be launched from a new space center at Svobodnyy 
starting in 2000 or 2001 (MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA 31 Mar).

<F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "We Are Under the </F>
Threat of Bacteriological Weapons!"] 
  [Text] According to findings by CESKY DENIK reporters, a 
very dangerous species [kmen] of bacteriological and virological 
[virologicky] weapons are secretly stored on the Czech 
Republic's territory. Our country is a signatory to the Geneva 
Convention, which obliges us not to allow our army to develop 
bacteriological or virological weapons, use them, or store them 
without international approval. 
  Within the framework of the former Warsaw Pact, the then 
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was authorized to develop 
bacteriological weapons. A very secret site was designated for 
this purpose in the Military Research Institute near Techonin in 
the Orlicke Hory mountains. The Research Institute operated 
within the framework of the Military Medical Academy in Hradec 
Kralove. Scientists from other Warsaw Pact countries 
participated in the development and testing of these very 
dangerous and inhumane weapons. They were mostly from the former 
Soviet Union -- from a Leningrad institute -- Bulgarians, and 
others. CESKY DENIK reporters have found out that the species 
of the bacteria and viruses developed in Techonin had been 
stored in various places in the Czech Republic until recently. 
On other, unknown places, they may still be stored. This is not 
only a violation of the Czech Republic's international 
obligations, but also a criminal act -- at the very least -- of 
posing a public threat with unpredictable consequences. 
  It is very likely that in the Military Research Institute in 
Technonin species of biological weapons are still being stored, 
or have been destroyed only very recently. They are for 
example, a culture of cholera, the plague, smallpox, tularemia, 
meningitis, and the rare psittacosis.

  [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The Czech Defense 
Ministry will not comment on today's press reports that 
dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses, which were to be used 
in the production of biological weapons, are stored at several 
localities in the Czech Republic, the Ministry has informed CTK. 
  According to the press, Czechoslovakia as a member of the 
former Warsaw Pact, was charged with the development of 
bacteriological weapons. They were allegedly developed at an 
undeground center of the Military Research Institute near 
Techonin, east Bohemia. The media claimed that the bacteria and 
viruses developed in Techonin had been hidden at various 
localities in the Czech Republic. 
  The press reports said that this not only contravened the 
Czech Republic's international commitments, because the country 
had signed the Geneva convention under which states undertake 
not to develop, use and store without international agreement 
biological weapons, but also threatened the public.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "A Crime Endangering </F>
Central Europe!"] 
  [Text] One of the places where, until recently, our army 
concealed very dangerous bacteriological and virological weapons 
was the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice! 
  CESKY DENIK reporters have discovered that strains for 
bacteriological weapons were stored, without expert supervision 
and the necessary caution, in a laboratory leased to a private 
company on the grounds of the Central Military Hospital in 
Stresovice. They were developed on the basis of a former Warsaw 
Pact treaty in a research institute in Techonin in East Bohemia. 
The laboratory, with its containers full of cultures for 
dangerous infectious germs prepared for combat use, was leased 
to the private Klinlab company. According to the information 
available, Deputy Defense Minister Engineer Miroslav Kalousek 
was involved in establishing this company and in leasing part of 
the Central Military Hospital, including the facility used by 
this company. The Defense Ministry also purchased expensive 
laboratory equipment for the Klinlab company. The whole project 
was described as top secret and of special significance. 
  Some of the containers, in which various kinds of bacteria 
for weapons "cultivated" by Czechoslovak military experts were 
stored, were sold into private hands, that is, to the Klinlab 
company. 
  Bacteriological and viral weapons are among the most 
insidious and dangerous. International agreements commit the 
Czech Republic to preventing their use, development, and 
storage. It is apparent from the findings of the CESKY DENIK 
reporters that the cultures for the bacteriological weapons were 
stored in the Central Military Hospital with the knowledge of 
some of our most senior military representatives.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes commentary: "Illegal Bacteria"] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl enriched the 
world by the knowledge of the appearance of nuclear death. The 
beginning of the nuclear age was announced by an act of war in 
the war that the United States neither began nor provoked. It 
took place at the time when the consequences were not known. 
The Chernobyl accident took place at the time when the 
consequences were known. Nevertheless, our subservient state 
leadership did practically nothing to protect the society 
against the aftermath of this accident. The crime of public 
endangerment, which then took place, has not been punished. 
  A journalist must not swallow any bait, nor can he miss any 
alarming news. The rumors about SS-20 missiles "forgotten" by 
the occupational power [on Czech territory] are among the things 
that simply cannot be missed. That is true despite the fact 
that one must know how to use a flare, or a warhead, and an 
explosion accidentally triggered by a layman is less likely than 
by an incompetent manipulation with a hand grenade. 
  The situation was worse when unverifiable rumors referred to 
a warhead with a chemical warfare agent. It was just the more 
"poignant" as both the Soviets and Czechoslovakia once promised 
that they would not keep such warfare agents. 
  Moreover, the treaties in which the USSR and former 
Czechoslovakia vouch that they will not use bacteriological or 
virological weapons would make a respectable library. It is not 
only that they promised not to use the weapons -- they actually 
promised not to have them. 
  Of course, some disease cultures, bacteria, and viruses are 
stored and cultivated for scientific reasons, even in the 
civilian sector. There are, however, long series of treaties 
and agreements that specify where and how. Under no 
circumstances, however, at a single location or even a single 
country. If they have, for instance, smallpox in Stockholm, 
then they do not have typhoid, which in turn is, let us say, in 
Milan. These treaties and agreements are also binding for the 
Czech Republic. 
  Nevertheless, the cultures, and in a form ready for combat 
use, have been and are here. In our army, completing its 
transformation and under the leadership of a Christian minister, 
who should know something about it? Our top brass, as is well 
known, are founding businesses, consortia, etc. You will find a 
small civilian business under the name of Klinlab also in the 
Central Military Hospital building. Similar cultures were 
brought there from Techonin in eastern Bohemia, where they were 
cultivated for the Warsaw Pact. They are stored in the Central 
Military Hospital contrary to all the aforementioned 
documentation. It is simply a commonplace company, equipped, 
however, at the expense of the Army, i.e. at the expense of the 
ordinary taxpayer. All this with the knowledge of the reformed 
General Nekvasil. Even his economic deputy, Kalousek, knew 
about it, for he approved the purchase of the equipment for the 
Klinlab company, which was certainly not cheap. 
  As we have managed to ascertain, the serum banks stored in 
the Military Hospital building contain gel ready for immediate 
use. Hence, a catastrophe can be set off by trickling out small 
pox, bubonic plague, or psitacosis etc., in the subway for 
instance. 
  An unintentional release could threaten Prague with, at 
least, the fate of Sverdlovsk (it is now called Ekaterinburg 
again), where a bacteriological warfare agent was released into 
the ventilation system of the local "pharmaceuticals factory" 
and, subsequently, mysterious epidemics broke out in the city. 
An unknown epidemic pneumonia was the most common cause of 
death. 
  In the Czech Army, the bacteriological and virological death 
received the mark PTZD [prisne tajne, zvlastni dulezitost] -- 
top secret, privileged information. The Central Military 
Hospital in Prague, in the building of which the Klinlab is 
located, is a military zone, where the police has no business. 
At the same time, it is also accessible to hospital visitors on 
the weekends, and, of course, to outpatients. This means that 
it is generally accessible. The building itself can even be 
accessed underground. 
  The building has been visited occasionally by a certain 
Colonel Zaykov and Mr. Frolov. Colonel Zaykov used to be a KGB 
attache, while Mr. Frolov was an adviser at the Foreign Trade 
Ministry. Currently, they both hold valid cards for foreigners 
with permanent residence here, and engage in business. How 
about selling these cultures to, let us say, Libya. Let us hope 
that the appropriate authorities will deal with this case in all

  [Text] Must we once again fear the Russian military? 
  The generals in Moscow have developed a new chemical weapon. 
The project is considered to be a state secret (code: "A 
232"). A scientist who informed the west about it was arrested 
for betraying state secrets. 
  The nerve poison (called "Novikhok") reportedly works even 
faster and more strongly than all chemical combat agents known 
so far. Bonn is alarmed. Dieter Kastrup, state secretary in the 
Foreign Ministry, says: "The Federal Government is worried 
about these reports."

Ministry of Defense Are Hurrying To Destroy Chemical Weapons: 
Vil Mirzayanov Believes, as Before, That This Is Impossible"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Disarmament </H5>
  Parliamentary hearings took place yesterday in the State 
Duma 
on the question of Russia's ratification of the Convention on 
the Prohibition and Destruction of Chemical Weapons. Oleg 
Sokolov, head of the arms control department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, reported that of the 
154 countries that signed the convention, only four have already 
ratified it at present. But the convention can go into effect 
only when, at a minimum, 65 countries do this. Mr. Sokolov said 
that everyone is waiting now for the document to be ratified by 
the major owners of OV [toxic agents], and "the Russian 
potential is the biggest in the world." Thus, "ratification of 
the convention by Russia among the first 65 would be in keeping 
with our national interests." In the event of delays in putting 
the convention into effect, Mr. Sokolov emphasized, "it will be 
necessary to consider the possibility of renewal of chemical 
programs by states," and "very serious responsibility for the 
disruption of the efforts of the world community" will fall on 
Russia. 
  Gen. Yuriy Tarasevich, deputy chief of Chemical Troops of 
the 
Russian Federation, reported in a clear and brisk military way 
that the problem of destroying the 40,000 tonnes of toxic agents 
announced by Russia revolves basically around money. The amount 
requirement is 2 trillion in rubles [R] (in last year's prices) 
and 535 million in dollars, and a third of these resources will 
be expended on the construction of "destruction facilities," 
whose site selection (there will be seven) is being worked on by 
a governmental commission headed by Oleg Soskovets. In the first 
phase, blister agents will be processed in Udmurtia (Kambarka 
settlement) and Saratov Oblast (Gornyy settlement). The other 
side of the problem, according to General Tarasevich, is the 
lack of an official concept for the destruction of KhO [chemical 
weapons]. However, he emphasized, the defense department is 
coping successfully with this obstacle, and a draft document 
developed in the Ministry of Defense has already been submitted 
to the government. Mr. Tarasevich reassured those in attendance 
that there have been no accidents and leakages in the storage of 
toxic agents from the moment their production was stopped in 
1982, and that there should be none in the foreseeable future. 
  The statement of Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, head of 
the 
committee on convention questions under the president of the 
Russian Federation, was also presented with restrained optimism. 
"Just what kind of a raw material problem does the processing of 
40,000 tonnes present?!"--he asked. "The Novocheboksarsk 
Chemical Combine (in one of whose shops domestic toxic agents 
were produced) processes 500,000 tonnes of raw materials per 
year. And here it is 40,000, over the course of 10 years 
(according to the terms of the convention), and at seven 
facilities..." The FRG and the United States are prepared to 
assist materially and technically. In a word, Mr. Kuntsevich 
declared, "the technical and technological capabilities exist, 
but they have to be supported financially." Without going into 
further detail, it can be said that almost all the members of 
the hearings talked about the necessity for "strict financing" 
as a main problem. 
  However, it is also necessary to mention the dissonance that 
could be heard in the words of Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who has 
fallen out of favor, who asserted that "during the years of 
Soviet power we produced 400,000 tonnes of toxic agents." He 
declared that, first, the convention "looks to the past," 
inasmuch as the newest toxic agents, which are extremely 
difficult to monitor, do not fall under it. Second, Mr. 
Mirzayanov emphasized, "we are not ready" for the destruction of 
old toxic agents, since "we are unable to control" the 
ecological situation and the state of health of the people 
around the "facilities," and on the whole there are no reliable 
technological processes, and also the period of 10 years is 
unrealistic (25-30 years are needed). Third, "we cannot afford 
this in this century." And although "this is no longer a weapon, 
but old trash," in Mirzayanov's opinion, it is better to store 
it for the time being than, without safe technology, to expose 
people to danger. 
  Similar hearings were conducted in the Supreme Soviet of the 
Russian Federation almost a year ago. The same people spoke 
then, with the very same arguments. It only remains to be seen 
whether it is for better or worse that nothing has changed 
since. Except that Vil Mirzayanov has spent time in prison...

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zhdankin under the heading "Weapons": </F>
"Mustard Gas Bubbles"] 
  [Text] ROSSIYA (No 50, 1993) previously published an 
article by scientist Lev Fedorov entitled "The Chemical Death 
Complex." Last week the Duma held special hearings devoted to 
the problem of chemical weapons destruction. 
  In Paris on 13 January 1993 Russia signed a convention 
banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of 
chemical weapons, and requiring their destruction. Now our 
legislators must approve a program in keeping with these aims 
and ratify the convention. According to the document, we (along 
with everyone else) must destroy our chemical weapons stockpiles 
by the year 2005. 
  By Russian presidential decree the Russian Federation 
Presidential Committee on Convention-Related Chemical and 
Biological Weapons Issues was established in 1992 to oversee all 
efforts on these issues. It is headed by an academician, Lt. 
Gen. A. Kuntsevich, who has spent his whole professional life 
forging our Motherland's "chemical shield." The committee 
prepared a program and submitted it for consideration by the 
prematurely dissolved Supreme Soviet. The parliament cut the 
program to shreds. 
  The negative aspects of that program have been carried over 
virtually unchanged to the "revised" program. Just two examples. 
Firstly, no provision is made for environmental impact 
assessment by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources (even though the most horrible toxins are 
involved). Secondly, there is clear testimony to the motives and 
priorities of those who designed the program: 90 percent of all 
hard currency funding ($494 million) are requested for "measures 
to provide national and international monitoring," i.e. they 
will be used for trips by official experts, including honoraria, 
per diems and other customary expenses. The level of 
compensation is the same as in the U.N.: $400 per person per day. 
  There are a million problems involved in the laudable goal 
of 
bidding farewell to our chemical military past. What quantity of 
chemical weapons have we actually accumulated, if we count not 
just those that are stockpiled, but also those that have been 
dumped at sea or buried? Where are they located? How much 
concealed contamination threatens the health of human beings and 
the environment in those places? Is the technology for 
destroying these weapons safe enough? Every general question 
raises tens and hundreds of more specific ones. 
  Convention committee chairman A. Kuntsevich and the deputy 
chief of chemical weapons forces, Maj. Gen. Yu. Tarasevich, 
familiarized the deputies with the official program for chemical 
weapons destruction. The generals reported that we have 
stockpiles of 40,000 metric tons (net weight) of chemical agents 
safely stored at seven sites. The destruction technology is 
wonderful and safe. The program is fine in every way and should 
be approved with only one amendment -- making its funding a 
separate budget item. 
  All apparently outstanding, but what is one to make of 
published reports that our "wealth" in this area is many times 
larger than the official figures? What about chemical weapons 
that were dumped at sea? According to doctor of chemical 
sciences L. Fedorov (see the aforementioned article) large-scale 
dumping was carried out in at least 12 major areas of the Baltic 
Sea, White Sea, Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. The generals 
claim not to be aware of any such thing, and even if they had 
heard something no documents pertaining to the matter have been 
found. A. Kuntsevich went so far as to report: "The Baltic 
states are not interested in the issue of chemical weapons 
dumped in the Baltic Sea." The general/academician termed other 
similar issues "soap bubbles." 
  Much was said about public monitoring. Yet the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection's representative, a doctor of sciences 
with highest-level access, was not admitted to a theoretical and 
applied conference on chemical agent destruction held in 
long-suffering Chapayevsk. On two occasions the ministry 
proposed that the committee add a section on environmental 
safety to the conference, but all in vain. 
  Generally speaking, hearings were held, and they went quite 
smoothly. Except for the speech by Vil Mirzayanov. That 
scientist's questions went unanswered. According to his data, we 
have manufactured approximately 400,000 metric tons of chemical 
weapons. What happened to the rest? How much will it actually 
cost to destroy even 40,000 metric tons? For example, the 
Americans' "known" stockpile is 35,000 tons (a credible figure). 
Getting rid of these weapons will cost approximately $15 
billion. Our picture of military chemical "socialist realism" is 
far from complete. We do not even have a technical or financial 
assessment of chemical agent destruction yet. 
  The chemical branch of the military-industrial complex 
clearly should cease to exist due to the fact that it is no 
longer necessary. But no one wants to give up their positions, 
titles or easy living, and therefore they must now replace 
chemical agent production with chemical agent destruction, 
thereby safeguarding their own interests. That is why the 
adoption of an unfinished program is being promoted so actively. 
The pressure is tremendous. Parliament is one of the last 
obstacles between the military chemical lobby and its access to 
a bright future of U.N. comfort standards. But what about the 
safety of our fellow citizens and the fouled forests and rivers? 
These have never been taken into consideration. 
  Judging by the hearings, parliament is not a very difficult 
obstacle, and it will soon be overcome. But I would very much 
like to be proved wrong.

  [Text] Bryansk -- For many years a strictly guarded 
facility existed in the rayon center of Pochep in Bryansk 
Oblast. Nobody there apart from the oblast party committee 
first secretary knew what was behind the barbed wire. Now the 
shroud of secrecy has been lifted and the residents of Pochep 
have found out that chemical weapons are being stored nearby. 
  But it was another discovery that particularly bothered 
them: 
It is planned to build a facility here to destroy the said 
weapons. 
  Local residents posed the reasonable question: "Surely 
Bryansk Oblast, which was contaminated by radiation from 
Chernobyl, should not also become an area for destroying 
chemical weapons?" Signatures are being collected in opposition 
to the plant's construction.

  [Text] Russia's Chief Airforce Commander Petr Deinekin says 
no agreement has so far been reached on the transfer to Russia 
of part of the former Soviet Union's strategic bomber aircraft 
deployed in Ukraine. In an interview with Interfax on Thursday, 
he put the number of such missile carrying aircraft at 42 
including 19 TU-160s and 23 TU-95 MCs. 
  The two countries are still at odds about the price. Kiev 
wants Russia to write off Rbl 700 Bn of its debt, but Moscow 
agrees to settle for less than a third of that amount. 
  Deinekin said the Russian Defense Ministry could easily 
order 
a new batch of aircraft for Rbl 700 Bn at home. He stressed 
that the Ukrainian bombers had been grounded for quite some time 
because of shortage of fuel and spare parts and extra spending 
would be needed to make them airworthy. 
  He regretted that Moscow's attempts to try to help Ukraine 
to 
denuclearize itself had failed to meet understanding from the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry. At the same time, he hoped further 
talks will be held in an effort to reach compromise.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "The mechanism for 
implementing measures stipulated by the tripartite statement 
made by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. on 
January 14 of this year has started to work," said a spokesman 
for the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  Grigoriy Karasin was referring to the arrival of the first 
shipment of nuclear fuel assemblies from Russia to the Ukrainian 
Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in 
Europe. The shipment was sent as compensation for Ukraine's 
dismantled nuclear warheads. 
  As the spokesman, in accordance with the three presidents' 
statement, all nuclear warheads should be transferred from 
Ukrainian to Russian territory, where they should be dismantled 
as soon as possible. Russia is then required to compensate 
Ukraine in the form of fuel assemblies for the latter's nuclear 
energy programme, also as soon as possible. 
  In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine, 
Russia 
agreed to provide the fuel assemblies, containing 100 tonnes of 
lowly enriched uranium, within ten months. In the same time 
period, at least 200 nuclear warheads from RS-18 and RS-22 
rockets will be transported from Ukraine to Russia for 
dismantling. 
  According to Russian specialists, the first shipment of fuel 
to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is enough to enable one of 
the plant's five reactors to work for an entire year, which will 
give Ukraine 5.5 to 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

amendment to the anti-dumping agreement for uranium has been 
adopted by Moscow and Washington. However, the present 
amendment has a number of restrictions. In particular, the 
Russian side has the right to sell only 50 percent of the volume 
indicated in a contract. The remainder of the supplies are 
carried out by American producers. In addition to this, Russia 
can sell 500 tonnes of natural uranium on the U.S. market per

  [FBIS Editorial Report] Paris AL-WATAN 
AL-'ARABI in Arabic on 1 April publishes on pages 34-36 an 
approximately 3,500-word report from Moscow by Pavel Davidov on 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the 
breakaway republics of the former Soviet Union and on sales of 
these weapons and sophisticated technology to Third World and 
other nations. The report cites dangers threatening many 
nations as a result of the Soviet republics' lack of control 
over their nuclear arsenal. It says the Russian intelligence 
and security agencies are incapable of protecting the world from 
the risks inherent in the proliferation of nuclear bombs, 
radioactive agents, missiles, and other weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  The magazine publishes highlights of a "secret report" 
submitted by the Russian Counterespionage Service to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin "a few days ago." This classified 
report contains a "clear warning that it is impossible to 
prevent thefts, smuggling, and secret trade, which is on the 
rise in military plants and sensitive laboratories. The report 
also points out that the states that broke away from the Soviet 
Union are also unable to protect the dangerous installations 
they have inherited. These states are selling the installations 
to dealers who come from Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and other 
nations, or to trade firms that specialize in gunrunning. 
Sometimes, plants are being sold, along with all their 
equipment, weapons, and experts. The report gives evidence that 
900 thefts from military and nuclear plants and 700 thefts of 
secret technology were reported only during the second half of 
1993, including nuclear weapons to Iran and Pakistan." 
  The report says that as a result of the unplanned 
reorganization of security agencies in Russia and the defects in 
the new structure of Russian security, Russian military 
institutions and plants, science institutes, and important 
laboratories have been deprived of the protection of the 
official security agencies. No special security agencies were 
established to protect those installations due to "lack of funds 
and the general deterioration in the country." 
  The report adds that what makes the situation even more 
difficult is that the newly independent republics do not know 
how to handle or get rid of the military and other plants on 
their territory. The leaders of those republics think the best 
way to remove these weapons and plants is by selling them to the 
highest bidder. 
  The report cites examples of the selling of weapons of mass 
destruction to other nations. In November 1993, a ship carrying 
40 families of Russian refugees arrived in the city of Isterkhan 
from Turkmenistan, including six families whose parents had 
worked in a secret workshop of the ammunition depot that belongs 
to the former Soviet war naval fleet. In this workshop, nuclear 
containers for torpedoes and sea mines were tested and most of 
them were sent to the Black Sea fleet. Following the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan decided that it 
did not need the containers, so the entire depot was sold within 
a year. The buyers were Iranians and Pakistanis. Also, a 
powder plant was sold in Uzbekistan when this republic saw that 
it no longer needs the plant and could not turn it into civilian 
production. The report adds: "We can give dozens of examples of 
this kind. The weapons of mass destruction spread all over the 
Third World from all the republics of the former Soviet Union 
because of the lack of control and protection exercised in the 
past by the KGB. These weapons can easily fall into the hands 
of irresponsible adventurers." 
  The report gives another example of the disappearance of a 
secret laboratory for scientific research in the area of 
chemical weapons and laser technology in a city in Kyrgyzstan. 
The buyer is unknown. 
  The report goes on to say that none of the republics of the 
former Soviet Union exercises state control over nuclear 
security, except for Russia which has a government committee to 
monitor nuclear activities. Even this committee has limited 
tasks. 
  The report devotes a chapter to the future of scientists, 
specialists in military industries, and nuclear experts. It 
discloses that "more than a third of the scientists and 
specialists in the nuclear field and highly sophisticated 
technology, who total 3,000 people that used to work in the 
Soviet Union, have left the country and now work at major 
scientific institutions in the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, and Sweden."

strategic missiles will be shipped from the territory of Ukraine 
to Russian reprocessing plants over ten months of this year. 
That is the amount stipulated by the trilateral declaration 
signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States and 
Russia in Moscow. 
  After the dispatch of the first sixty weapons from the 
strategic missiles located in Ukraine to Russia, however, the 
leadership of the MO [Ministry of Defense] of Ukraine had to 
clarify and alter the schedules already approved for the later 
transport of the nuclear ordnance. Why was this done, and will 
it have any consequences? Our correspondent posed those 
questions to the chief of the Center for Administrative 
Management of the Strategic Forces of the Ministry of Defense of 
Ukraine, Lt. Gen. Oleksiy Kryzhko. 
  O. Kryzhko: The process of withdrawing the 
ordnance is a very crucial matter; both for the state and for 
the people. And it has to be done under certain conditions that 
ensure nuclear security, chief among which is confidentiality. 
These issues, with references to well-informed sources in the 
Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, are unfortunately 
being covered in great detail in the pages of the press both 
here and in the Russian Federation, as well as on television, 
right down to indicating the timetables and destinations, if 
there are warheads and how many, and what routes will be taken. 
This in no way conforms to the conditions under which this 
process has to take place. I believe that it is enough for the 
broad public to know that the process of the removal of nuclear 
weapons from Ukraine has begun on a nationwide scale. 
  S. Zhurets: Is this circumspection connected with 
the possibility of the threat of terrorist acts? 
  O. Kryzhko: It is connected with literally 
everything. I do not have in mind here only the threat of 
terrorism. This is a question of the normal process of ensuring 
nuclear security. It is necessary, after all, to prepare a 
railroad with all of its services, guarantee the fulfillment of 
measures pertaining to ensuring nuclear security, and prepare 
our combat services with the support personnel, the bases from 
which the warheads are sent, and the bases that are receiving 
them. It is a very broad circle of issues, in the resolution of 
which chance cannot be tolerated. 
  S. Zhurets: Recent statements by the press service 
of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on this score are saying 
that certain forces in Russia have a vested interest in slowing 
down, or even breaking off, the planned withdrawal of nuclear 
weapons from Ukraine, so as ultimately to accuse Ukraine of 
slowing down the process of nuclear disarmament. I would like to 
know your point of view. 
  O. Kryzhko: That is the first time I have 
encountered that interpretation. I have constantly felt pressure 
on the part of the Russian Federation, for the last year and a 
half, that Ukraine begin the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from 
its territory as quickly as possible. We saw the same strivings 
in the negotiations on the nuclear problem with specialists from 
Russia. And today, at the level of the technical fulfillment of 
the decisions that have been made, we all feel the same striving 
toward accelerating, and not slowing down, the process of 
withdrawal of nuclear warheads from Ukraine. 
  S. Zhurets: Nonetheless, Ukraine is now forced to 
specify the routes and schedules for transporting the nuclear 
combat units. Doesn't that specification of the schedules affect 
Ukraine's fulfillment of its obligations with regard to 
deadlines? 
  O. Kryzhko: No, it in no way affects it. Ukraine 
is fulfilling the obligations it has assumed. 
  S. Zhurets; Does the 43rd Army have sufficient 
capabilities with regard to manpower and equipment so that the 
process of deactivating the strategic missiles and withdrawing 
the nuclear warheads to Russia can take place without any 
deviations and tensions? 
  O. Kryzhko: As for the technical aspect, we have 
everything necessary, with the exception of a sufficient 
quantity of power resources -- fuels and electric power. We have 
lately begun to receive fuel from the Americans; true, a rather 
small amount, in accordance with agreements and signed treaties 
-- several tonnes of gasoline and diesel fuel. They are 
promising to supply us with an additional quantity of fuel at 
the end of March. We are seeking out every opportunity to 
fulfill our obligations as stipulated in the trilateral 
declaration. So that we do not look to all the world as people 
who say one thing and do another. 
  S. Zhurets: Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Voronin, chief designer, Federal </F>
Nuclear Center, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for 
Experimental Physics; Viktor Voronov, chief, Department for 
Problem Analysis for Nuclear Armaments, All-Russian Scientific 
Research Institute for Experimental Physics; and Sergey Brezkun, 
researcher, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for 
Experimental Physics: "Why Is the Nuclear `Diad' Destructive to 
Russia?"; first three paragraphs are introductory paragraphs] 
  [Text] The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) 
concluded by Russia and the USA in January 1993 has still not 
been ratified by either the Russian or the American side. In the 
course of the Treaty's hearings in the Russian parliament in the 
spring of 1993 a number of arguments were put forward against it 
and they still define the critical attitude towards START II on 
the part of some Russian politicians, military brass and 
representatives from the military-industrial complex. Proceeding 
from the need for debate on this issue, MN has decided to 
publish an article received by the newspaper from three experts 
in this sphere. The article also raises a highly important 
question bearing on the further development of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces. 
  The opinions in this article are solely the authors' and in 
no way reflect MN's position on the Treaty. By printing the 
article, MN hopes that the discussion of this issue will 
continue. 
  Recently, growing importance has been placed on the need to 
elaborate the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). We are 
well aware of the fact that such ideas quickly travel from the 
pages of academic journals to official doctrines, accords and 
programs and this is why we consider it important to understand 
a likely result of all this. 
  While all past mutual agreements between the USA and the 
USSR 
on nuclear armaments stipulated a mere reduction in the number 
of strategic armaments, leaving each side free to decide on the 
structure of its strategic nuclear forces, START II for the 
first time outlines requirements on their qualitative and 
strategic performance. This treaty envisions a dramatic 
reduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) with 
multiple independently targeted warheads but the ideas for 
future elimination of land-based ICBM's and a transition to a 
certain nuclear diad consisting of strategic aircraft and 
nuclear submarines carrying ballistic missiles on board. 
<H5>  What Does START II Have in Store for Us? </H5>
  The implementation of START II allows the USA to preserve a 
"triad" structure relying heavily on the submarine fleet, which 
reasonably serves the interests of a major sea power. As for our 
country, according to the treaty we are to eliminate our 
land-based ICBMs, a measure which would hardly be reasonable or 
well-founded from the point of view of Russia, a major land 
power. The gist of all this can well be shown by comparing the 
structural composition of strategic nuclear forces of each side 
(in terms of combat charges) prior to the implementation of 
START II -- 1991, and following it. 
  It is obvious that should land-based intercontinental 
ballistic missiles with multiple independently targeted warheads 
be eliminated, Russia would lose a large part of its strategic 
nuclear forces which were most reliable, i.e. strategic rocket 
troops (SRT). If START II is implemented, SRT will be left with 
only "Topol" (SS-25) ICBMs which carry only a single warhead. 
  The USA, according to START II, also must sharply reduce its 
strategic ICBM's including its "MX" missiles. One should not 
forget the following however, First, the land-based missiles 
have never been of the utmost importance to the USA. Second, the 
American strategic nuclear forces still keep the "Minuteman-3" 
ICBMs which are capable of carrying multiple warheads, but under 
START II will be allowed to carry only a single warhead. This 
will allow them to be reequipped with a separating head section 
carrying three warheads, since START II does not stipulate any 
measures for preventing an inversion of those missiles. 
  Also, one should not forget the plan to replace the outdated 
warheads on 500 Minuteman-3 ICBMs with the 500 modernized 
warheads which are being removed from 50 MX missiles (each of 
them carries ten warheads). This actually means a planned 
replacement of old ammunitions with modernized ones. 
  As to the rest of the components of the nuclear triad 
affected by START II, the matter is as follows. The USA has 
traditionally had powerful strategic aircraft which successfully 
combine the advantage of heavy aircraft-carriers with the 
possibilities of medium-speed low-flying and difficult-to-detect 
ALCM strategic rockets. 
  The USSR strategic aircraft existed just "for show" and what 
Russia has today is not even worth taking into consideration: 
only several dozen out-of-date Tu-95 heavy bombers and only two 
modern Tu-160 aircraft. 
  As to the sea-based component of the strategic nuclear 
forces, Russia's marine constituent of the triad is largely 
inferior to America's with respect to the accuracy of the 
submarine ballistic missiles, the noise level of the submarines 
themselves and their deployment. Suffice it to say that less 
than 30 percent of Russian submarines are on combat duty at a 
given moment, this figure for the USA is 80 percent. In 
addition, the USA possess a most powerful anti-submarine network 
covering practically all the regions where our submarines 
conduct patrols. It is also noteworthy that the American attack 
submarines act, let us say frankly, quite brazenly in Russia's 
territorial waters, close to the Northern Fleet. 
<H5>  What Does the Nuclear Diad Have in Store for Us? </H5>
  One should be aware of what we give up and what we get if 
the 
diad is implemented. 
  First, Russia would be deprived of its traditionally most 
significant and essential component within the strategic forces, 
i.e. strategic rockets. 
  Second, due to the physical and moral wear-and-tear of 
strategic aircraft and submarine fleets we would be forced to 
spend large sums on building new bombers and nuclear submarines, 
as well as on the renovation of their infrastructure (land, air 
and sea). The best proof for this can be found in the figures: 
the cost ratio of a missile fired from a land-based ICBM and 
that of a submarine-launched ballistic missile is approximately 
1:10. This means that an ICBM is ten times as cheap to launch. 
  Third, the ecological risk will still be with us since 
constant combat patrolling and training flights of heavy bombers 
as well as the presence of nuclear submarines in the world's 
seas threaten with disasters such as the "Palomares" (the loss 
of an atom bomb from an American bomber in Spanish waters in 
1960s), or our "Komsomolets" submarine or the American 
"Thresher" and "Scorpion" submarines. 
  Fourth, the structure of the strategic nuclear forces of 
Russia and USA will gradually stabilize owing to the 
qualitatively different performances of strategic aircraft and 
attack submarines, and discrepancy between Russia's diad and its 
geopolitical features: US aircraft and submarines can be 
deployed secretly and are capable of delivering a surprise and 
uncontrollable attack. Nor should one forget about the US air 
bases beyond its national borders, nuclear weapons mounted on 18 
aircraft-carriers, as well as about sea-based rockets mounted on 
submarines of the US Navy. 
<H5>  What Is the Solution? </H5>
  Thus, additional measures would leave us with less mutual 
security rather than more. This can be argued with the fact that 
the above concerns could be justified only by a confrontational 
approach to the issue. We do not insist on our concerns being 
absolutely justified. However, if Russia and the USA retain warm 
relations and trust, wouldn't it be better if we do otherwise: 
completely liquidate our nuclear-powered air and submarine 
fleets retaining only ICBMs on our respective territories. The 
remaining ICBMs of a single-warhead type would be easy to 
mutually control since they are deployed on national 
territories. Their maintenance is relatively inexpensive. What 
is more, their warheads can be removed for better confidence and 
greater security. This would also mean that the marine component 
(cruise missiles and nuclear aircraft on the aircraft-carriers) 
is no doubt, to be destroyed too. All this should result in 
maximum confidence and equally ensured global stability with the 
lowest level of nuclear armaments. 
  With other nuclear powers being prepared to adequately 
reduce 
their nuclear arsenals, one could also ponder on lowering this 
level to 500 ICBMs. It goes without saying that the option would 
stabilize the international situation as a whole: if only Russia 
and the USA would set a strong example for other members of the 
"nuclear club," the latter would find it hard to refuse from 
adequate moves. 
  In addition to apparent political and moral gains one can 
discern many others. First of all, the sides would enjoy a huge 
savings of money, eliminating the expenses on production, 
testing, maintenance, and subsequent retiring the aircraft and 
submarines (as well as their nuclear armaments), and on the 
maintenance and development of all kinds of infrastructure for 
the air and submarine fleets, etc. (Incidentally, the USA could 
gain a great deal since they would be able to save on a most 
powerful system of anti-submarine defence.) 
  What is more, by abolishing the air and sea nuclear 
components, Russia and (especially) the USA would relieve the 
territories beyond their borders of a potential threat -- by 
eliminating a network of foreign bases. 
  No doubt, these possibilities could be realized in an 
atmosphere of genuine and equal partnership and sincere 
intentions. But if this raises questions, then is it right to 
initial START II and destroy the missiles which can be kept even 
under this treaty and to proceed to a diad?

  [Text] Mirny, Arkhangelsk Region, April 12 TASS--The Topol 
(Poplar) missile complex, which has no analogues in the world, 
is not only operational with Strategic Missile Forces (SMF) to 
ensure Russia's worthy parity but is also used for peaceful 
purposes, Lt. Gen. Yuriy Zhuravlyov, chief of the state test 
site of the SMF, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  The launch of a "Start" communications satellite 
demonstrated 
the Topol's unique resources in the peaceful uses of outer 
space. A heavy-duty communications satellite is to be launched 
soon, Zhuravlyov said. 
  Within the framework of Russian defence-industry conversion 
to civilian uses, experts consider the possibility of using the 
test site facilities for participation in commercial launchings, 
in which many countries show interest. If only initial funding, 
which will subsequently bring in revenue quickly, is essential 
for implementing conversion programmes. The allocation of funds 
for the needs of the state test site of the SMF has been now 
reduced to the minimum, Zhuravlyov lamented.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Security" rubric: </F>
"Americans Insist on Observance of Conventional Forces. Moscow 
Intends To Work for Higher Quota in Caucasus"] 
  [Text] NATO will decline all of Russia's attempts to alter 
the terms of agreement on conventional forces in Europe that 
limit Russian military presence on the Northern and Southern 
flanks. This was stated on Sunday by U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry in the NBC "Meet the Press" program. He advised 
that he had discussed this topic with the leaders of countries 
which the possible changes may affect most, and met with no 
support. 
  Limits on arms under the Conventional Forces in Europe 
treaty 
go into effect next November. Under the document, Russia is 
entitled to keep on its Northern (Leningrad military district) 
and Southern (Caucasus) flanks not more that 580 armored 
personnel carriers, 700 tanks, and 1,280 artillery pieces per 
flank. Moscow, however, is pressing for a revision of the flank 
quotas so as to be in a position to increase its military 
presence in the Caucasus region. According to THE NEW YORK 
TIMES, Russia does not agree to make up for the strengthening of 
the Caucasus grouping by making corresponding cuts in the 
Northern flank. The newspaper also reports with reference to 
sources in the American intelligence service that Russia would 
like to get its Southern quota increased by 2,000 armored 
personnel carriers, 400 tanks, and 500 artillery pieces. 
  Oleg Sokolov, head of the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry 
defense department, to whom your SEGODNYA correspondent turned 
for clarification, stated that the question of flank quota 
revision is still on the agenda. He pointed to the circumstance 
that the conventional arms treaty was signed in 1990 during a 
standoff between the military blocs. Today the situation in 
Europe has radically changed. We count, Mr. Sokolov said, on 
understanding of our concern and will continue consultations 
with those parties to the treaty who have to do with solving the 
question. Precedents of these kinds of exceptions already 
exist, the diplomat pointed out.

<F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Pavel Grachev Creating Special </F>
Region in Kaliningrad. Lech Walesa Alarmed"] 
  [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa has called the number 
of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast an "alarming 
phenomenon." He does not understand why it is necessary to 
maintain such a powerful grouping in peacetime, and has called 
on Western politicians not to close their eyes to this 
"excessive militarization." 
  While in Riga recently, Walesa expressed concern at the fact 
that there are around 100,000 Russian troops in the Kaliningrad 
area. His position is shared by Lithuania, which has a common 
border with the oblast. Vilnius began to be particularly 
insistent in demanding explanations after Pavel Grachev, who 
visited Baltiysk in mid-March, announced that Russia intends to 
set up a "special defense region" in Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  The new term used by the minister came as a surprise both to 
military strategists and to diplomats. At any rate, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry could tell us nothing instructive on this 
score. With a view to its geopolitical uniqueness we can guess 
what makes the region "special." It is harder to understand 
whom it is necessary to provide a defense against. Against a 
potential aggressor on sea or land, according to Grachev. 
  Vilnius and Warsaw are on their guard. Germany and the other 
NATO countries are being tactful. The British Gen. Hardy 
Johnson, commander in chief NATO Forces, Northern Europe, who 
visited the Baltiysk naval base the other day, said that he 
respects Russia's right to have near Kaliningrad the army it 
considers necessary. As long as its size does not go beyond the 
framework of the Europe-wide CFE treaty. 
  Under the treaty, the Defense Ministry explained, Russia 
could keep 3,800 tanks and one-third of all its Armed Forces in 
the enclave. Thus, as far as "militarization" is concerned, 
this quota has by no means been used up. But this does not mean 
that the grouping will be increased. 
  Meanwhile, Lithuania continues to propose that NATO and the 
CSCE elaborate a special regime for Kaliningrad which, it 
claims, will lose its status of "Russian enclave" by the year 
2000 in accordance with the Potsdam agreements. Admittedly, the 
idea met with no support from the Western states, which are 
proclaiming the principle of the inviolability of postwar 
borders. 
  Vilnius itself is taking steps toward "demilitarization," 
placing obstacles in the way of military trains crossing 
Lithuanian territory, making detachements [komandy] disembark, 
and not allowing the transit of combat hardware into Kaliningrad.

neither producing nor testing nuclear weapons," ITAR-TASS was 
told by Lt. Gen. Yuriy Zhuravlev, head of the state testing area 
under Russia's Strategic Missile Command. 
  On Monday, a large group of journalists from various 
publications, information agencies, and radio and TV stations 
arrived at the top secret garrison in Mirny. They will be able 
to acquaint themselves with some of Russia's latest military 
technology, in particular, with the "Topol" experimental missile 
system which is expected to become part of the armed forces in a 
couple of years. 
  The journalists' arrival corresponded with celebrations of 
Cosmonaut's Day. In Mirny, this holiday is widely celebrated, 
since much has been done here for progress in space. 
  "We have no secrets to hide from Russians and the world 
community, but our openness does not hinder our responsibility 
for the security of Russia," Yuriy Zhuravlev declared.

Sensational Document -- The Study Was Done by Military Experts 
Under the Coordination of the Foreign Intelligence Service: 
Zhirinovskiy's Earthquakes Are Threatening Romania"] 
  [Text] Related to various speculation that is being made 
in connection with the mysterious weapon mentioned by Russian 
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Romanian experts 
have reached the conclusion that actually one has to deal with a 
maneuver launched by special Russian bodies intended to 
intoxicate public opinion, and which, owing to lack of 
information, have managed to fool the mass media in the West and 
even in our country. Thus, they went so far as to consider the 
Elipton a sonic weapon, a biological weapon, and even a 
microwave weapon, while the true nature of this 
military-technical system was lost in the general cacophony. 
  Elipton is a weapon system based on gravitational 
interference. After the last catastrophic earthquake that shook 
Yerevan, U.S. military analysts revealed two strange things: 
The catastrophe, which seemed to be a natural one, occurred at 
a "providential" moment to halt Armenia's autonomist tendencies 
and it also offered the Soviet political-military authorities a 
good pretext to liquidate the Armenian nuclear power industry, 
and thus impose an acute energy dependence on that central 
republic; the second element refers to the fact that 
early-warning satellites recorded an orbital "double lightning," 
which preceded, by a very short time, the earthquake. That was 
an unmistakable sign of the detonation of a small-size nuclear 
load, contravening all currently valid international treaties. 
It was easy to draw conclusions: The Soviets have discovered a 
way to trigger earthquakes. Ten months later, using a rocket 
launched from an F-15 fighter-bomber (ASAT system), the United 
States managed to intercept, for the first time, a low-orbit 
satellite. The system was allegedly designed to destroy Soviet 
spy satellites, but actually it was the sole efficient defense 
to counter the use of the Elipton over U.S. territory. However, 
certain rumors had already reached the ears of the mass media -- 
it was the time when many people believed in an imminent and 
catastrophic reactivation of the San Andreas fault, some sources 
even held it possible that "half of California would sink into 
the ocean," as a consequence of a devastating earthquake. 
  The advantages of the Elipton are obvious: It is a discreet 
weapon, and any accusations can be brushed off by saying it is a 
"phantasm," provided that it is used by daylight, so that its 
lightning could be camouflaged by the sun's natural light. 
  It is quite significant, that merely three days after 
Zhirinovskiy's extremely allusive statement regarding the 
Elipton, the Geophysical Institute of the Russian Academy 
organized a news conference on the issue of seismic weapons, 
although no one had explicitly talked about such a thing. That 
news conference seems to be rather the result of panic. The 
Russians did not know precisely to what extent Zhirinovskiy, the 
former GRU [Soviet Military Intelligence] agent, had divulged 
about the Elipton, and they assumed that Western journalists 
were at least aware of the exact nature of that weapons system 
and the name of the person coordinating the program, which, as 
it later turned out, was not the case at all. During this news 
conference they claimed that in fact the Elipton does not exist 
at all: "Earthquakes cannot be triggered except in the places 
where nature has already prepared them," said the official 
statement, which, as a matter of fact, was quite precise. The 
statement actually confirmed previous information about the 
existence of the Elipton-type weapon systems and about their 
nature, and it also offered an exact description of the way in 
which they work. The Hammer [as published] triggers earthquakes 
wherever there is accumulated tension in the ground, which can 
be unleashed by a minimal variation of the gravitational 
acceleration. Thus, they can trigger earthquakes -- the 
magnitude of which, it is true, is very difficult to predict -- 
in areas in which over the past 1,000 years there has not been 
any seismic activity at all. 
  The Romanian state is directly vulnerable to weapons such as 
the Hammer or the Hole [as published] that are part of the 
Elipton program. Important industrial centers of our country 
and vital establishments of our defense industry are situated in 
valley areas such as Tara Barsei [central Romania, where the 
Carpathian Mountains turn], in which the triggering of 
catastrophic tornadoes could cause enormous damage to our 
industrial infrastructure. Moreover, owing to the existence of 
the seismic area in Vrancea [north-eastern Romania], the 
possible use of Hammer-type weapons there would cause a 
catastrophe in Bucharest, considering the current precarious 
state of the buildings in our capital city. 
  Such weapons might be used in the near future if a 
geopolitical conflict breaks out as a consequence of the 
unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania or of our 
country's active integration within NATO. No methods are known 
to counter such weapons. However, one could count on warning 
signs offered by attempts to use them, which fail owing to 
insufficient precision.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonard Nikishin: "Who Can Cause an Earthquake"] </F>
  [Text] A shocking report that the earthquakes in 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Armenia were the result of 
nuclear tests conducted in the Soviet Union as part of a program 
for the development of a so-called seismic weapon--for the 
deliberate shifting of tectonic plates--appeared in the French 
newspaper FRANCE SOIR with references to the opinions of 
prominent Russian seismologist Aleksey Nikolayev, former RF 
presidential adviser Aleksey Yablokov, and former intelligence 
officer Oleg Kalugin. 
  Our correspondent asked Deputy Director Aleksey Nikolayev of 
the Earth Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
for his comments. Here is what the scientist said: 
  "It is true that I discussed these matters with the Moscow 
correspondent of the SUNDAY TIMES some time ago. He was 
interested in my articles about the effects of nuclear 
explosions on earthquakes and the development of seismic 
processes. I was virtually the only person researching this 
connection. I told the correspondent that one thing was 
absolutely clear: It would be virtually impossible to develop a 
seismic weapon. I also said that nuclear explosions do have some 
effect, however slight, on earthquakes--not in the sense that 
they cause them, because this is a result of massive natural 
processes, but in the sense that they can hasten the onset of a 
burgeoning quake. My findings were based on the use of extremely 
sensitive equipment, which was capable of measuring even the 
slightest influences. I denied that the earthquakes in Armenia 
and Georgia were the result of nuclear explosions in 
Semipalatinsk and on Novaya Zemlya." 
  "I do not know what the SUNDAY TIMES reporter had to say 
about this meeting, but I have the FRANCE SOIR item, which was 
clearly based on the British article, here on my desk. It says 
that Aleksey Nikolayev believes that the earthquakes in 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Armenia are the after-effects 
of nuclear tests. This is the exact opposite of what I said. It 
says Yablokov `suspects' that a seismic weapon is being 
developed in our country and that Oleg Kalugin, `chief of Soviet 
counterintelligence,' frankly admitted his awareness of 
scientific projects related to this weapon. `That is utter 
nonsense,' Kalugin said when one of our staffers asked him about 
this." 
  "This `wild goose' in the newspaper is far from harmless. 
Articles of this kind arouse doubts about our country and 
encourage people in the West to make decisions with negative 
implications for us. And the West is not the only problem...." 
  "You may recall that after the earthquake in Georgia, then 
Georgian leader Zviyad Gamsakhurdia declared that it was caused 
by the Russian tectonic weapon. This is how the anti-Russian 
hysteria started." 
  "I hope the article in your newspaper will put an end to all 
of this speculation," Aleksey Nikolayev said at the end of our 
conversation.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report: "It Is Not We But the United </F>
States and Britain Which Are Ready To Produce Biological 
Weapons, Russian Expert Believes"] 
  [Text] IZVESTIYA No. 40 published material from Britain's 
THE SUNDAY TIMES in which it was claimed, with reference to 
anonymous intelligence sources and the testimony of three 
defectors, that the Russian Ministry of Defense, without the 
knowledge of the country's president, is secretly carrying out 
work on a program to create bioweapons. 
  The Russian Ministry of Defense described any suspicions 
concerning Russia's violation of the ban on the development, 
production, and stockpiling of biological weapons as "completely 
groundless." 
  In his turn our correspondent succeeded in meeting with an 
expert from one of Russia's special services who is well 
acquainted with the results of visits by a Russian delegation to 
biological facilities in the United States and Britain. What 
did our specialists see there? 
  "A group of Russian experts visited several biological 
facilities in the United States in February-March of this year. 
These trips take place in the context of a 
Russian-American-British accord on reciprocal visits to the 
three countries' biological facilities. In the United States 
our experts visited two enterprises belonging to a private 
company, Pfizer, and the center for the study of animal 
diseases, which belongs to the U.S. Department of Agriculture." 
  "At Pfizer's former plant for the production of biological 
weapons, manufacturing equipment formerly intended for the 
production of military-use biological compounds not only 
survives and is maintained in good working order, but is even 
being redesigned and modernized. No attempt was made to keep 
the specialists from seeing technological-apparatus lines for 
growing, concentrating, drying, mixing, and packaging biological 
preparations having a dual purpose (civilian and military), 
which, although they have not been operated for many years, are 
maintained in good condition." 
  "Several of the firm's principal laboratories and production 
buildings boast specific architectural-design solutions, 
engineered systems for the protection of personnel and the 
environment, hermetically sealed equipment and manufacturing 
areas that do not correspond to the list presented by the firm 
of microorganisms on which work is being carried out. In other 
words, the possibility exists for conducting in these buildings 
work with the pathogens of dangerous infectious diseases of man 
and animal. It is noteworthy that right here our specialists 
were not permitted to take a sample." 
  "In October last year and in January this year the Americans 
and the British also visited our Pokrovskiy Biological 
Preparations Plant, the Berdskiy and Omutninskiy Chemical 
Combines, and the Scientific Research Institute of Applied 
Microbiology in Obolensk. In 1992 American and British experts 
were invited to participate in an independent commission set up 
by directive of the Russian president to inspect the activity of 
the Institute of Particularly Pure Biological Preparations in 
St. Petersburg. That same institution which the West had 
accused of working on a 'superplague.' The Western experts were 
given the opportunity to visit unhindered any of the institute's 
structural subdepartments, laboratories, and premises, to talk 
with institute staffers, and to take photographs. It was 
acknowledged that the institute's activity does not contravene 
the 1972 Convention." 
  "In the United States our experts encountered a different 
attitude, to put it mildly. The American side did not provide 
conditions analogous to the visit of the U.S.-British delegation 
to Russian nonmilitary biological facilities, as was stipulated 
in the earlier-agreed documents. Our experts were not admitted 
to several laboratories and one building. Tough restrictions on 
photographing and videoing were established for us. They were 
not allowed to take a biological sample. One facility was 
opened for visiting only after a time delay, and only following 
persistent demands from the delegation and our embassy. Things 
were no better during the visit to the facilities of the company 
Evans Medical Ltd in Britain." 
  "I think that the new round of accusations against us is no 
coincidence. It is an attempt to preempt us. You see, a 
session of the Preparatory Committee of the Special Conference 
To Examine Potential Measures To Monitor the 1972 Convention is 
due to be held soon. Russia's desire to establish tough and 
wide-ranging measures to monitor compliance with the Convention 
is clearly not to some people's liking."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Academician Sergey Nikitich </F>
Kovalev, general designer of nuclear submarine missile carriers, 
by Sergey Ptichkin; place and date not given: "The Storm of 
Reforms Is Stronger Than the `Typhoon'"] 
  [Text] I went to see Academician Sergey Nikitich 
Kovalev, general designer of nuclear submarine missile carriers, 
with one purpose in mind: To ask him to discuss the history of 
the creation of the sea-based strategic system Typhoon, which is 
the pinnacle of shipbuilding thought of the 20th century. But 
the interview did not work out. Sergey Nikitich delivered a 
passionate monologue on what, in his opinion, had made Russia a 
great power and what guarantees its greatness in today's 
world. 
  Russia is about to celebrate the 300th anniversary of its 
Navy -- Kovalev smiled sadly. An organizing committee was even 
created to prepare for the celebration. But what will we 
celebrate? 
  When Peter the Great was building ships, the entire country 
was watching. Every indentured serf knew that when the tsar 
introduced new taxes he would put the people's money mainly into 
the construction of a fleet for the powerful country. As they 
would say nowadays, Peter I was implementing a nationwide 
program at that time. Since that time, serving in the Russian 
Navy has been tantamount to serving the Homeland... 
  When the Americans began to launch the first nuclear 
submarines, the entire country was watching this great 
experiment. Everyone understood that a program that was costly 
but vitally necessary to the United States was being implemented. 
  Our nuclear fleet was built under the cover of strict 
secrecy 
and nobody knew the difficulties that were surmounted by our 
scientists, engineers, and workers in order to preserve for 
Russia the status of a great naval power. 
  When the United States began to carry out the great 
strategic 
project Trident, the whole world was watching this. 
  And few people knew that at that same time -- a year later, 
actually -- the USSR had begun to create an analogous strategic 
system, the Typhoon. Without any grandstanding we solved the 
most difficult problems, and with much less cost than the 
Americans did. We were able to have our own sea-based strategic 
weapons system, which is equal to the Trident, in place at 
practically the same time as they did theirs. 
  It was having the Typhoon in place that put an end to the 
nuclear missile arms race between the USSR and the United 
States, although for some reason people have always remained 
silent about this and spoken only about mobile land-based 
missiles, which were supposed to have created the parity we all 
know about. No! Only the sea-based strategic forces that 
appeared in the USSR in response to the American challenge 
showed that there was no point in further increasing nuclear 
weapons. 
  And now I have to talk about something I do not want to 
mention since it is stupid to put questions of the development 
of Russia's strategic forces up to public plebiscites; they 
should be decided in the corresponding staffs by specialists who 
are professionally trained for this. But the situation is 
developing in such a way that today even we people who are not 
used to public speeches have to appeal directly to the citizens 
of Russia through the media for moral support. 
  What kind of country will we have to greet the 21st century: 
Either the great world power which it still is to this day, in 
spite of all the disorder, or indeed a likeness of "Upper Volta 
with missiles?"... This is by no means about another round of 
the arms race. On the contrary, it is about more efficient 
expenditure of the scanty state funds, about the possibility of 
preserving Russia's national independence in reality and not on 
paper. 
  The fact is that today it has become especially crucial to 
decide the future of Russia's strategic nuclear forces and which 
to give priority to. 
  At the present time we are just developing the concept of 
strategic weapons, which should be fully in keeping with the 
defense doctrine we adopt. And it does not seem quite right to 
me to publish articles of an openly promotional nature like the 
one in IZVESTIYA of 9 February under the heading "Topols Will 
Defend Russia" or openly defamatory ones like the one in 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS for 26 March. 
  Incidentally, today it has become acceptable to write only 
bad things about the fleet, so it is probably not worthwhile to 
respond to every "critical" article which is especially written 
in street language. The article that appeared in IZVESTIYA is a 
different matter, since the declarative heading itself seems to 
proclaim unambiguously: The decision has been made, only Topol 
land-based mobile missile complexes can defend Russia. 
  In a brief newspaper article it is impossible, of course, to 
go into a detailed comparative description of various kinds of 
strategic weapons, but precisely as a result of a detailed 
comparison it would be possible to prove convincingly that it is 
by no means land-based missiles but only strategic sea-based 
forces, which are fully in keeping with the defense doctrine, 
that are capable of defending Russia from any attack. 
  The fact is that only sea-based missile complexes have an 
immense advantage over land-based in terms of their ability to 
be retargeted to any object. There are many tactical devices to 
guarantee the concealment of submarine missile carriers, as 
distinct from land-based missiles, which are constant targets. 
Moreover the probability of destroying missiles launched from 
fixed starting positions (silo or "mobile") is considerably 
greater than those that start from under water. And, finally, a 
responsive missile volley even from just one submarine that has 
survived is much more effective than a volley from dozens of 
Topols which by some miracle have survived after the first 
aggressive enemy attack. 
  But, I repeat, all these are specialized issues which the 
public must accept on faith or else not believe at all. We love 
to refer to the American experience. So let us look at what the 
Americans are doing today in the area of their own nuclear 
missile forces. 
  The United States made a decision to completely do away with 
land-based complexes, giving all priority to sea-based forces 
alone. The fact is that the Americans quite reasonably saw that 
in the future land-based complexes could not be used as 
counterattack missiles; they are good only for those who have 
aggressive intentions. 
  After investing a good deal of effort and money in the 
creation of the most complicated MX mobile missile system, the 
United States today is abandoning this complex as well. The 
Pentagon has recognized that even on the excellent American 
roads it is quite dangerous to transport nuclear missiles, which 
are exposed to everything, be it military aggression or a 
terrorist act. 
  Today land-based nuclear missile complexes present a greater 
threat to the territory on which they are located and which they 
are intended to defend than they do to a hypothetical enemy. So 
by refraining from further development of strategic missiles on 
their territory, the Americans are actually showing concern for 
the safety of the United States and their compatriots. Perhaps 
our common sense should not be so different from that of the 
Americans. We must simply understand that land-based strategic 
missiles with any base have fulfilled their historic role and in 
the future should be mothballed altogether. 
  The only effective means of restraining and preventing 
aggression both for the Americans and for us are sea-based 
strategic weapons systems. 
<H5>  OUR NOTE </H5>
  For many years Sergey Nikitich Kovalev was one of the most 
concealed designers of our Homeland's defense complex. And he 
probably did more to establish the USSR nuclear submarine fleet 
than was done in the United States by Admiral David Rickover, 
who was practically a national hero across the ocean. Well, we 
sometimes do not know our own defense industry heroes as well as 
we do foreign ones. But they are the ones, these hidden 
academicians, who created the potential of hidden power that 
makes it possible for Russia's leaders to feel that they are 
leaders of a great power.

  [Text] Estonia's parliament, the Riigikogu, on Wednesday 
[6 April] approved a law regulating the transit and export of 
strategic goods. 
  "Undoubtedly, this is of no special interest to Estonia -- I 
think that during next decades we are not planning to supply us 
with such weapons," Estonia's Environment Minister Andres Tarand 
said on commenting on the new law. 
  The law, however, enables Russia or some other foreign 
country to sell missiles or other weapons to other countries 
through Estonian ports, Tarand said. 
  The law initiated by Estonian government regulates export 
and 
transit of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Tarand said 
while adding he did not approve transit of such environmentally 
hazardous materials. Such activities, however, provided 
international rules are observed might bring Estonia economic 
benefits.

by August 1995 when the 50th anniversray of nuclear strikes on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki is to be marked. 
  Speaking to reporters he said his people, like the Japanese, 
had suffered from nuclear weapons. 
  "If Japan faced an open nuclear attack, the (former) USSR 
used the weapons against Kazakhstan in peacetime by conducting a 
total of 527 tests" at the Semipalatinsk range, he said, adding 
that over 100 of them were ground and air explosions. 
  Nearly half a million of people of Kazakhstan were affected 
by the blasts, according to Nazarbayev.

  [Text] There can be no question of resuming nuclear tests 
at the Semipalatinsk test site, Kazakh leader Nursultan 
Nazarbayev told Russian mass media leaders in Moscow on 
Wednesday. 
  He said as many as 526 aerial, surface and underground 
nuclear blasts had been carried out in eastern Kazakhstan in the 
past 40 years. An estimated 500,000 people fell victim to the 
tests and serious environmental damage was caused. 
  "Kazakhstan has so far been left alone to face those 
problems. The Russian president and I discussed this at length 
and I can now say with confidence that Russia will help us in 
utilizing that large scientific complex for peaceful purposes. 
For example, the Semipalatinsk site can be used for testing 
safety systems of the nuclear power plants or as a space 
training center in concert with Baikonur," Nazarbayev said. 
  At the same time, he called for an international commission 
to be set up, Russia included, to assess the volume and nature 
of damage caused to the people and environment. "This can at 
least help set priorities in eliminating the harmful effects 
from testing," Nazarbayev said.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report followed by Yuriy Konorov commentary: </F>
"Baykonur's Future Decided" -- first three paragraphs are 
ITAR-TASS report] 
  [Text] The changes made to the agreement between Russia 
and Kazakhstan on the status of and conditions for using the 
Baykonur cosmodrome and the city of Leninsk in literally the 
last few hours before the ceremony at which the two countries' 
presidents signed it cannot be described as significant. 
Moreover, the document preserves the points on which the 
Russian side in particular was insisting: a lease period of 20 
years with a further 10-year extension, and agreement for 
Russian citizens -- servicemen of the Russian Federation 
Military Space Forces -- to stay at the cosmodrome and service 
it. The only change is that the rent payments are $115 million 
a year [as published]. 
  The problems over Baykonur's status in fact started last 
summer, when Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev put forward 
the idea of turning Baykonur into an international spaceport. 
  Both sides win from the Baykonur lease arrangement. 
Kazakhstan cannot maintain Baykonur on its own: It has neither 
the money nor the specialists for this at present. And Russia 
would be deprived of a base for launching heavy carrier rockets 
over the next few years while it establishes a new cosmodrome. 
  [Konorov] Now that all the worries are over, we can look 
back and recall the circumstances under which the negotiations 
took place. The politicians, economists, and legal specialists 
spent a long time preparing for them; and, to give them credit, 
they prepared well: Every figure was checked down to the last 
cent (given that the cost of the rent is in dollars -- 115 
million a month) [as published]. It emerges that the Russian 
specialists, basing themselves on international experience and 
Kazakhstan legislation, insisted that the real cost of the lease 
should be $80 million. The Kazakh side took no account of these 
arguments. The essence of their claims boiled down to the 
statement: "But we need 150 million." The negotiations were 
going badly until a "judgment of Solomon" was found. The two 
sums would be added together and then divided in half. The 
so-called "arithmetic mean" came to 115 million. 
  In addition, an understanding was reached that a significant 
proportion of this sum would be paid "by barter" in the form of 
all kinds of services. 
  How firm is this understanding? Like Russia, Kazakhstan now 
has certain obligations to foreign partners to carry out 
international space programs. The influence of international 
public opinion and the prestige of space powers are arguments of 
considerable weight in this protracted dispute.

  [Text] Moscow, 30 Mar, ITAR-TASS--A joint Russian-Kazakh 
report on the results of the official visit by Kazakhstan 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev to Moscow from 27 to 30 March was 
circulated here today. 
  The document notes that there was an in-depth exchange of 
opinions on a broad range of issues of mutual interest during 
the course of the talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
conversations with other Russian officials. Particular 
attention was focused on questions regarding the further 
strengthening of bilateral ties and cooperation in the spirit of 
the points of the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual 
assistance of 25 May 1992 between the Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. 
  The sides expressed satisfaction at the dynamic development 
of Russian-Kazakh relations and noted their positive role in 
solving complex problems during the period of transition that 
both countries are experiencing, as well as in strengthening the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, and in ensuring stability in 
the Euro-Asian region. 
  An agreement was reached on new forms of economic 
cooperation, in particular on the setting up of transnational 
production and other corporations and of joint 
financial-industrial groups. 
  An important part in the talks was taken up by questions of 
interaction in ensuring reliable security within the framework 
of a common military-strategic space. Agreements were reached 
on various aspects of military and military-technical 
cooperation. 
  The Russian side welcomed Kazakhstan's joining the treaty on 
the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as a state that does 
not possess nuclear weapons, and it considers this step to be an 
important contribution to the strengthening of global stability 
and universal peace. President Nazarbayev handed the document 
on the Republic of Kazakhstan's joining of this treaty to 
President Yeltsin as head of the depository state. 
  Agreements were reached regarding a practical solution to 
questions of the dismantling of nuclear weapons on the territory 
of Kazakhstan and on the use of their components. 
  The sides expressed satisfaction at the conclusion of an 
agreement on the Baykonur cosmodrome, in which fundamental 
questions were resolved on the use of this complex in the 
interests of the civil and space defense programs of the Russian 
Federation, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and other countries of 
the CIS. They intend to complete in the near future the working 
out of specific accords on the practical implementation of this 
agreement.

  [Text] Kiev, April 13 (AFP) -- Ukraine has received from 
Russia a first shipment of nuclear fuel from its dismantled 
warheads in line with a U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement reached 
in January, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk told AFP 
Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Tarasyuk said that Russia sent the first convoy of fuel to 
be 
used to run power plants to the southern city of Zaparozhnye 
Monday after Ukraine threatened to suspend dismantling of its 
nuclear warheads. 
  Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetsky told a news conference 
during a visit to Germany earlier this week that Ukraine would 
stop dismantling the weapons because of Russia's failure to 
provide the fuel. 
  Tarasyuk, who returned from talks in Moscow, said he had 
received assurances from Russian officials that they would 
fulfill their obligations under the agreement signed by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  "Ukraine will not raise any obstacles in the implementation 
of this trilateral agreement if all parties involved fulfill 
their commitments," Tarasyuk said. 
  Ukraine was the last of the four nuclear states of the 
former 
Soviet Union to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons under the 
agreement that provided Ukraine with at least one billion 
dollars in financial compensation and nuclear fuel shipments to 
run the country's power stations.

  [Text] Bonn April 12 TASS -- Replying to a question as to 
who controls nuclear weapons deployed on Ukraine's territory, 
the republic's Defence Minister V. Radetskiy, who was addressing 
a press conference at the end of his visit to Germany, said that 
at present there is a bilateral control on such weapons. But it 
is ordered by Ukraine, as "it is her property," the minister 
emphasised. A tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons was 
signed and a time-table of its withdrawal and destruction was 
approved this year in Moscow through the U.S. mediation. "The 
Ukrainian side is consistently and sincerely observing" this 
time-table, he said. According to him, until now two train 
loads of nuclear warheads have been despatched to Russia. In 
exchange Ukraine was supposed to receive fuel for its nuclear 
power plants from Russia. But Russia has not fulfilled this 
condition for the time being. That is why we have been obliged 
to suspend the time-table of withdrawal, to clarify it and make 
it binding on Russia to honour its commitments," he said.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 7 April, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister 
Valeriy Shmarov met representatives of the U.S. Department of 
Energy and the U.S. commission for nuclear regulation. He 
expressed concern in connection with the fact that the Russian 
Minatom [Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering] had no money for 
the production of fuel cassettes for nuclear power stations, 
which Russia pledged to supply to Ukraine in exchange for 
nuclear warheads, in compliance with the trilateral agreement 
between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia on the nuclear 
disarmament of Ukraine. In this situation, pointed out the 
deputy prime minister, those $60 million that the United States 
was going to pass over to Russia would be of help, however, this 
has not been done as yet. U.S. Ambassador William Miller, who 
was present at the meeting, responded by saying that the money 
had already been transferred to the relevant bank account.

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- According to 
UNIAN, during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to 
Ukraine, Ukraine's foreign affairs minister was given a 
memorandum that explained the official U.S. position with regard 
to cooperation with Ukraine in the missiles and space sphere. 
The document, in particular, concerns the obligatory terms 
under which the United States will consider it possible to 
establish mutual relations between the two states in the 
above-mentioned sphere: Ukraine's accession to the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCR), to the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and its refusal to 
manufacture offensive missile systems according to MTCR 
categories and classifications. Stressing that the United 
States "will not assist and will not engage in trade if such 
activity contributes to the development of systems in the MTCR 
category and even space carrier rockets," the U.S. side noted 
Ukraine's interest to accede to the MTCR which has recently been 
established and is ready to assist Ukraine in this. 
  During William Perry's visit, a preliminary agreement was 
also reached about the fact that the U.S. side would, at the end 
of April, conduct further talks with Ukraine on these issues. 
On 12 April, during a news conference on the occasion of World 
Aviation and Cosmonaut Day, in reply to a question from a UNIAN 
correspondent whether such talks would take place, Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov said that work in this area was 
underway. Ukraine in particular is "attempting to convince the 
U.S. to be somewhat more considered in its attitudes to the 
realities that Ukraine finds itself in." The deputy prime 
minister stressed, in particular, that directness and 
unambiguity in the talks could lead to Ukraine losing its rocket 
technology and personnel, and it is not known where Ukraine 
would end up tomorrow. In Valeriy Shmarov's words, in the last 
few days, a letter was received by him from William Perry in 
which the "U.S. side agreed with us on many things," and 
undoubtedly by the end of April there would be consultations and 
an exchange of views on this matter. 
  Based on the course of the talks and development of events 
in 
Ukraine itself, Valeriy Shmarov expressed certainty that Ukraine 
would accede to the MTCR and will become the founder of a new 
Cocom regime. According to information received by UNIAN on the 
same day, as a political step toward Ukraine's full membership 
of MTCR, the United States has proposed the conclusion of a 
bilateral U.S.- Ukrainian agreement with the aim of acceding to 
the main principles of MTCR.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] Following a visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry and NASA specialists to Ukraine, talks between the 
two countries' space agencies are expected to intensify in the 
near future. 
  Volodymyr Horbulin, director general of the National Space 
Agency of Ukraine [NKAU], believes, however, that the talks 
between NKAU and NASA will not concern cooperation in the 
production of rockets. The reason behind this is Ukraine's 
refusal to join the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Volodymyr 
Horbulin noted that Ukraine, which has unique rocket-building 
technologies, having refused to sign the NPT, has wasted one 
year, during which Russia has managed to establish comprehensive 
cooperation in the space industry with the United States. 
  NKAU and the Ministry of External Economic Relations are 
currently making considerable efforts to encourage Ukraine's 
joining the NPT. 
  During upcoming talks with NASA, NKAU will discuss the 
possibility of cooperation in conducting remote-controlled 
probes of earth from space and developing satellite 
telecommunication systems. The Ukrainian side is going to offer 
NASA a radar to study the ocean's surface, developed by the 
Pivdenne design bureau, and technology for electric welding and 
construction assembling in space, developed by the Paton 
Institute. 
  With the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine's space industry has 
suffered considerable losses such as, for example, the fact that 
the Pivdenne design bureau has lost 3,000 employees over the 
last two years. Volodymyr Horbulin refused to reveal how many 
people are currently employed by the Pivdenne design bureau, 
stating only that the number of people who have left the bureau 
"is huge." The director general of NKAU, however, emphasized 
that all the specialists who left the bureau are still working 
in Ukraine.

  [Text] Novosibirsk April 7 TASS--The chemical plant in 
Novosibirsk is facing a tough financial situation which can 
affect the implementation of the Ukrainian nuclear disarmament 
programme. 
  The plant is the only enterprise in Russia which produces 
fuel for water-moderated water-cooled reactors which is to be 
shipped to Ukraine in exchange for its nuclear warheads. 
  The first batch of fuel assemblies was shipped to Ukraine in 
the end of March, deputy director general of the plant Vladimir 
Rozhkov told TASS on Thursday. 
  The Finance Ministry had to pay for the fuel nearly 30 
billion roubles, but the enterprise had received no money so far 
and cannot buy a number of accessories necessary for the 
production of nuclear fuel assemblies. 
  Experts of the enterprise warned that reserves will last 
only 
for one month. If production stops many Russian nuclear power 
plants will remain without fuel as well. 
  "A disruption of nuclear fuel shipments to Ukraine is not 
ruled out because the state, which is acting as a contractor, 
does not fulfill its commitments in time," Rozhkov said.

  [Text] The submarine Le Triomphant was secretly launched in 
Cherbourg this weekend. More details now with Herve de Haro 
from Cherbourg: 
  [Haro] Le Triomphant is a high-tech marvel. With a 
displacement of 12,640 tons and a length of 138 meters, it is 
much larger than its predecessors. It is faster too and should 
also be extremely quiet, one of the quietest in the world -- it 
could even be called a stealth submarine. Its propeller is 
classified top secret and is careened to protect it from preying 
eyes and to make it even more silent. 
  Le Triomphant is now in its natural element. It will sail in 
a few months time for its first sea trials. The first concern 
of the DCN [Direction of Navy shipbuilding] is to find all the 
noises made by the various equipment on board the submarine. 
All the noises will be recorded and analyzed, and engineers 
will have to reduce them. 
  Le Triomphant must be able to sail undetected even by the 
most sophisticated detection equipment. This is Herve de Haro 
reporting from Cherbourg for France Inter.

<F P=106> [Report by Barcin Yinanc: "Russia Causes Uneasiness in </F>
Ankara"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that Turkey continues 
to be concerned about Russia's intention to violate the 
Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE] Treaty. Russia's deployment 
of troops in the Caucasus, particularly over the past three 
months, has made Ankara uneasy. Turkey has reportedly cautioned 
its allies several times about the presence of Russian troops in 
the region, who are violating the CFE limits on the presence of 
military units in the southern region. 
  Officials who have been closely following Russia's efforts 
to 
revise the CFE limits in the southern region say that Russia's 
military buildup in the northern Caucasus and its moves to 
strengthen its military presence in Georgia and Armenia have 
caused concern. The officials said: "Russia's military 
presence in the Caucasus will significantly exceed the CFE 
limits if the present trend is allowed to continue." 
  Meanwhile, Georgia and Armenia, who have allowed Russia to 
establish military bases on their territory, reportedly have 
been cautioned both bilaterally and multilaterally on the 
problems they may confront if their military presence exceeds 
the CFE limits. Stressing that Georgia and Armenia must view the 
presence of Russian forces on their territory within the 
framework of the CFE limits on their own military forces, the 
officials said: "That means that Georgia and Armenia will have 
to reduce their own military forces, which would have a negative 
impact on their independence and sovereignty."

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION Defence Correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The maiden flight of the 32 billion pound sterling 
Eurofighter 2000 was a success, much to the relief of 
industrialists and politicians in the four partner nations. 
  It will be the world's most advanced fighter aircraft apart 
from the American F-22, which will be more than twice as costly 
and several years later entering service. 
  Eurofighter is designed as a highly agile multi-role 
aircraft, capable of ground-attack as well as its primary air 
defence role. 
  Developed by Britain (33%), Germany (33%), 
Italy (21%), 
and Spain (13%), it will replace the RAF's Jaguars, 
Tornado F3s 
and now defunct Phantoms from the year 2000. 
  It is an aerodynamically unstable aircraft requiring 
on-board 
computers to make thousands of calculations every second to keep 
it in the air by controlling the flaps, rudder and front 
"canard" wings. 
  The single-seat cockpit is highly automatised to allow the 
pilot maximum time to engage the enemy. 
  Powered by two new EJ200 engines, it has a top speed of 
twice 
the speed of sound and can operate between the limits of nine 
times the force of gravity and minus three times gravity in 
tight turns and other manoeuvres. 
  On normal missions it will carry two short-range and four 
medium-range air-to-air missiles. A 27mm cannon is carried 
internally. 
  The advanced ECR90 radar developed by GEC-Ferranti will 
allow 
pilots to detect, track and fire at enemy aircraft well beyond 
visual range. 
  Eurofighter is also equipped with an infra-red search and 
track system that will enable pilots to spot the enemy by 
detecting minute differences in temperature between the target 
and its background. 
  This will complement the radar as it is a passive system so 
it cannot be detected and it makes "stealth" aircraft visible.

<F P=106> [Article signed EE/BN: `The `New Forum' Replaces COCOM -- A </F>
Good Decision According to the Swiss Delegation'; as released by 
Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Amsterdam, 31 Mar (ATS) -- The COCOM [Coordinating 
Committee on Export Controls] has been dismantled. The 
coordinating committee on the unilateral control of exports of 
high-technology weapons to the former East bloc countries will 
now be called the "New Forum." Its structure has been slightly 
modified. The decision was made at the two-day conference in 
Wassenaar near The Hague. The Swiss delegation welcomes this 
arrangement. 
  Rolf Jeker, a member of the Federal Office for Foreign 
Economic Affairs (OFAEE), said that this was a reasonable 
decision as far as security policy is concerned. Some 
transparency in the export of weapons is a good thing, the Swiss 
delegation head told ATS. 
<H5>  Swiss Membership </H5>
  So far, Switzerland has cooperated with COCOM only on an 
independent basis. Following the example of Sweden, Finland, 
Ireland, and New Zealand, it became a fully fledged member of 
the "New Forum," however. 
  Last November, at the first "high-level meeting" [preceding 
three words in English], COCOM's 17 member countries (Japan, 
Australia as well as all NATO countries excluding Iceland) 
acknowledged that the organization had no more reason to exist 
given the end of the Cold War. At the second meeting in the 
Netherlands, the members decided definitively to disband it. 
<H5>  Interim Period </H5>
  The disbandment of the organization will leave no 
international convention on military property and dual-purpose 
items (that also can be used for defense) during the interim 
period, until October, when the "New Forum" is set up. During 
this period the member states will have to reinforce the 
controls on their national exports. 
  A working group will draw up a new list of products, while 
another will set up an information exchange system. The "New 
Forum" will have to expand as quickly as possible. Russia could 
be present at the next meeting in October. China, Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are seen as important 
possible new members.

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russia would like to take 
part in the organisation which will succeed the Coordinating 
Committee on Export Controls (Cocom), which ceases its existence 
as of April first according to a decision taken by Cocom's 
representatives during a meeting held in a suburb of the Hague. 
  Cocom's "death" symbolizes the disappearance of one more 
relic from the "Cold War." Cocom was formed in 1949 by the NATO 
countries with Australia and Japan to establish strict controls 
over the export of strategically important technologies and raw 
materials to the socialist bloc countries. 
  As far as Cocom's "successor" is concerned, it will not be a 
structure similar to its predecessor, but basically a new 
organization which should implement an international programme 
to monitor the movement of arms and dual-use technologies, 
ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources. 
  The new organization should forestall the purchase of such 
goods for military purposes, but will hopefully not be aimed 
against one state of group of states. 
  Work on an agreement concerning the new organization is due 
to begin in the near future. China, Poland, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia have announced their interest in being 
part of the Cocom-successor organization. So far, a decision 
has been made to found three working groups which will outline 
the main purposes of the future international institution. 
  Consultations on the approaches of various countries to the 
problem of export control will be continued. Russia has already 
taken part in such negotiations and is ready to continue to play 
an active role in them on a partner-like basis. 
  The most important question remains that of working out an 
effective international control mechanism which will replace the 
old principles and help maintain the necessary high level of 
knowledge about the spread of strategic technologies and 
materials.

<F P=106> [Article signed "SM/AZ": "Disarmament Conference in Geneva </F>
Heads Toward Stopping All Nuclear Tests"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva 30 Mar (ATS) -- Nuclear tests have been 
partially prohibited since 1963. The Disarmament Conference 
devoted most of its winter session, which ended in Geneva on 
Wednesday [30 March], to drawing up a treaty that would prohibit 
all nuclear tests. The stage of declaring good intentions is 
now past, and a treaty could be ready within the next 12 to 18 
months, affirmed Mexican Ambassador Miguel Marin-Bosch. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch, who is the chairman of the committee 
responsible for negotiating such an agreement reiterated that 
since the signature of the Treaty of Moscow in 1963 -- banning 
nuclear tests within the atmosphere, in extra-atmospheric space, 
and underwater -- more than 2,000 nuclear tests had been carried 
out by the United States and the former USSR. Both these 
countries, along with Great Britain, are signatories to the 
agreement on a partial stop to tests. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch underlined that a treaty prohibiting all 
nuclear tests constituted a "very important" part of a universal 
regime aimed at nuclear non-proliferation. In particular, this 
regime involves negotiations on certain fissile materials, and 
an agreement protecting those countries which have no nuclear 
weapons. 
<H5>  Ratified by 160 Countries </H5>
  Some 160 countries have now ratified the treaty partially 
banning nuclear tests. Moreover, the united States and Russia 
have decided on a moratorium of their underground tests, 
prolonged until 1995. Great Britain is de facto applying the 
same rule. 
  For France, President Francois Mitterrand stated that his 
country would also observe a moratorium for as long as he 
remained president. China may shortly go ahead with a test in 
the atmosphere. However, when deciding on its moratorium, the 
United States probably estimated that fresh Chinese tests would 
not undermine their technological progress, asserted Mr. 
Marin-Bosch.

  [This is an updated version of an article of the same 
title published in the 31 March edition of the Arms Control 
Report.] 
Russia has signed a long-term lease with Kazakhstan for 
rights to the 
Baykonur Cosmodrome. However, the commander of Russia's 
Military-Space 
Forces is advocating development of a new cosmodrome at a former 
ICBM base 
on Russian territory. The new facility would use converted 
SS-19 missiles 
to orbit light payloads as well as a new Russian heavy 
booster. 
<H5>  Agreement Signed on Baykonur </H5>
  On 28 March Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed a 
series 
of bilateral agreements in Moscow. Among the documents was a 
leasing arrangement for the Baykonur Cosmodrome arrived at after 
weeks of intense negotiations. Under its terms Russia will 
lease the cosmodrome from Kazakhstan for a 20-year period with 
an option for a ten-year renewal. Baykonur will be under 
Russian sovereignty and Russians working at the cosmodrome will 
be subject to Russian legal jurisdiction. Russia will also be 
permitted to station its Military-Space Forces at the cosmodrome 
to conduct space launch operations. The agreement also 
recognizes Russia's property rights to all cosmodrome facilities 
in place as of 31 August 1991 (TRUD 30 Mar). 
  Russia agreed to pay an annual leasing fee of $115 million 
(ITAR-TASS 28 Mar). At the exchange rate as of the signing 
date, the annual fee would be over R2OO billion. According to 
press reports the leasing fee was a compromise between the 
Russian offer of $80 million and the Kazakh demand for $150 
million (INTERFAX 28 Mar). Kazakhstan had reportedly offered a 
lease term of only three to five years while the original 
Russian position was for a thirty-year term. The Kazakhs' 
demand for $7 billion compensation for environmental damages 
caused by past comodrome operations was relegated to a special 
bilateral commission for discussion as a separate issue 
(INTERFAX 14 Mar, 20 Mar). 
  In a 1 April interview, Yuri Koptev, Director of the Russian 
Space Agency (RSA), stated that Russia's draft budget for 1994 
allocates R135 billion (about $82 million) for leasing of 
Baykonur (INTERFAX 1 Apr). According to Koptev, the $33 million 
shortfall in the $115 million due to Kazakhstan will be made up 
in the form of services. These will include Russian assistance 
to Kazakhstan in developing its national space program. For 
example, transmission capacities on Russian Gals satellites will 
be allocated to Kazakhstan for direct TV broadcasting. Koptev 
also announced that the cosmonaut crew to be launched to the Mir 
orbital station on 20 June will include an ethnic Kazakh. 
<H5>  Alternatives to Baykonur </H5>
  With the breakup of the Soviet Union the Baykonur Cosmodrome 
became the property of Kazakhstan. Basic questions concerning 
Russian rights to the facilities, the status of the Russian 
Military-Space units staffing Baykonur, and the financing of the 
cosmodrome and its associated city of Leninsk remained 
unresolved. Despite a May 1992 agreement on financing of the 
cosmodrome signed by Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev, numerous 
media reports have indicated a sharp deterioration in conditions 
and losses of skilled personnel. Some commentators have raised 
the question of whether Baykonur can continue to operate if the 
situation did not improve. 
  Creation of a new space launch complex for military and 
civil 
use on Russian territory as a replacement for Baykonur has been 
under consideration. In May 1993 the Russian government was 
reportedly examining a proposal made by the high command of the 
Military-Space Forces together with the Russian Space Agency to 
create a new cosmodrome in Russia. Locations under 
consideration at that time included Krasnoyarsk Kray and the 
Kapustin Yar Missile Test Range (K0MMERSANT DAILY 22 May 93). 
In December 1993 a statute issued by the Russian Government and 
Council of Ministers set forth provisions for state support and 
maintenance of space activities in Russia (Statute No. 1282, 
dated 11 Dec 93, published in R0SSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 29 Dec 93). 
The statute set Russian autonomy in space operations as a basic 
strategic goal. Among its provisions was a directive to the 
Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian Space Agency, and other 
national Ministries to draw up proposals for upgrading Russia's 
northern cosmodrome at Plesetsk and for construction of a new 
cosmodrome in the Russian Far East. 
  In February of this year media reports indicated that the 
city of Blagoveshchensk in Amur 0blast was being considered as a 
cosmodrome site. The First Deputy Director of the Russian Space 
Agency (RSA) Valeriy Alaverdov stated that the project was for 
the distant future and that Russia was doing everything possible 
to ensure that Baykonur remained operational (R0SSIYSKIYE VESTI 
10 Mar). However, General Vladimir Ivanov, commander of Russian 
Military-Space Forces, claimed that a Far East launch center 
would be operational by the year 2000 (INTERFAX 9 Mar). 
<H5>  Svobodnyy-18 ICBM Base </H5>
  In a speech in early March the head of the Amur 0blast 
administration claimed that the Russian government was seriously 
considering a launch facility at the city of Svobodnyy, located 
about 200 kilometers north of Blagoveshchensk, and urged 
President Yeltsin to issue a directive to proceed with 
construction at the site (IZVESTIYA 12 Mar). The site in 
question is the Svobodnyy-18 ICBM base. On 15 March, General 
Ivanov, headed a delegation of more than sixty military and 
civilian aerospace experts on a tour of the former Strategic 
Missile Forces base at Svobodnyy-18. Speaking to leaders of the 
Amur region, Ivanov claimed that the first test flights from the 
Svobodnyy site are planned for 1996 (INTERFAX 16 Mar). 
  Proponents of the plan claimed that use of missile silos and 
other facilities of the former Svobodnyy-18 ICBM base would make 
it possible to begin launch operations quickly and with 
relatively low costs for site development. Major-General 
Aleksandr Vinidiktov, the former commander of the Strategic 
Missile troops at Svobodnyy-18 and now designated as commander 
of the Svobodnyy Cosmodrome, claimed that virtually no 
government funding would be needed to begin space launch 
operations at the site (ITAR- TASS 18 Mar). According to this 
plan, silos, originally built for 55-11 ICBMs and now scheduled 
for destruction under the START-2 Treaty, could be modified for 
launching the "Rokot" space launch vehicle (SLV). The Rokot is 
one of several conversion projects involving modification of 
ICBMs for use as space launchers. "Rokot" is the designation 
for such a conversion of the SS-19 ICBM. Under this scenario, 
two silos would be used initially to launch light payloads with 
the Rokot SLV, which has been claimed to have a payload capacity 
of two metric tons to a 500 km orbit (K0MMERSANT DAILY 7 Apr 
93). Three additional silos would then be activated for Rokot 
launches and two launch pads for heavy SLVs would be constructed 
(ITAR-TASS 17 Mar 94). 
  Officials in the Russian government and the Russian Space 
Agency reacted negatively to the proposed development of 
Svobodnyy and emphasized that no official government approval 
has been given for such a project. According to Boris 
Ostroumov, Deputy General Director of the Russian Space Agency, 
any potential advantages of the Svobodnyy site would be more 
than offset by its remoteness from the primary research and 
production facilities of Russia's space infrastructure. In 
Ostroumov's formulation, construction of a major space launch 
site in the Far East would be "tantamount to building it out of 
diamonds" (IZVESTIYA 12 Mar). Given the restricted national 
space budget, the RSA argued for maintaining existing facilities 
and trying to reach an acommodation with Kazakhstan on Baykonur. 
  While Svobodnyy's location in eastern Siberia presents 
problems, its latitudinal position is a point in it favor. 
Lying somewhat further north than Baykonur (51 24 N versus 47 
50 N) it is situated in the southernmost region of Russian 
Federation territory, a basic consideration for launches to 
equatorial or low-inclination orbits. A further advantage of the 
location in the Russian Far East was said to be the possibility 
that such a facility could open the way for Russia to enter the 
developing market for space launch services in Southeast Asia 
(IZVESTIYA 12 Mar). 
  On 23 March Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets denied reports that construction had begun on a new 
cosmodrome in the Far East and stated that the matter was not 
under discussion in the government. He went on to say "We are 
unable to ensure the normal functioning of the available launch 
pads, not to mention building a new one." Soskovets' position 
was supported by Yuriy Semenov, head of NPO Energiya, who stated 
that Russia would not be able to retain the status of a space 
power if it lost the Baykonur Cosmodrome (ITAR-TASS World 
Service 23 Mar). Semenov described the current situation at 
Baykonur as "catastrophic" and claimed that the cosmodrome would 
cease operating unless remedial actions were started by April. 
<H5>  Angara-24 Heavy Launcher </H5>
  A replacement for the Baykonur Cosmodrome would have to 
include a capacity for launching heavy SLVs. Russia currently 
has no facilities for heavy launchers at its northern cosmodrome 
at Plesetsk. Launch facilities for the Zenit (SL-16), Proton 
(SL-12, -13), and Energiya (SL-17) boosters are available only 
at Baykonur and all manned flight missions are launched from 
there. Russian space launches supporting the Alpha 
international space station program would have to be conducted 
from Baykonur. 
  Commentators have referred to a new Russian heavy launcher, 
designated "Angara-24," as the SLV that would be launched from 
two pads to be built at the Svobodnyy facility. These are the 
first references to such a booster to appear in Russian media. 
However, in mid-1993 a French aerospace journal reported a 
Russian plan to consolidate its SLV inventory to only four types 
by the end of the century. The "Angara" was to be one of the 
four Russian SLVs. According to the French report, the Angara 
would be an "improved Zenit" that would be manufactured in 
Russia and replace the current Zenit produced in Ukraine 
(See FBIS PERSPECTIVES Vol 8 No 8, August 1993). 
  According to the current references the two-stage 
"Angara-24" 
will combine elements from both the Zenit and the Energiya-Buran 
systems as well as new design features. It will use relatively 
non-polluting kerosene and LOX-hydrogen propellants. The head 
of the Military-Space Forces press center claimed in an 
interview that the Angara would be more powerful than the Proton 
(Mayak Radio Network 26 Mar 94). The first stage will be 
designed to make a gliding return to the launch site and be 
reused. First flight tests are scheduled for 1998-1999 with 
operational launches from Svobodnyy to begin around 2000-2001 
(ITAR-TASS 16 Mar). The Angara is reported to be under 
development by NPO Energiya, the Khrunichev Scientific 
Production Center, and the Makeyev Design Bureau in Miass, 
Chelyabinsk oblast (SEGODNYA 24 Mar). 
<H5>  Continued Interest of Military </H5>
  In an interview given just before the announcement of the 
leasing agreement on Baykonur, Lt-Col Gorbunov of the Russian 
Military-Space Forces press center responded to a suggestion 
that the publicity devoted to building a new Russian cosmodrome 
in the Far East was a tactic to put pressure on the Kazakh side 
in the negotiations. He responded that politics was not 
involved, but rather the basic goal of Russia's guaranteed 
access to space, especially to launches to geostationary orbits, 
currently performed only from Baykonur (Radiostantsiya Ekho 
Moskvy 28 Mar). 
  Media commentaries appearing after the 28 March leasing 
agreement reflected a continuing divergence between civilian 
specialists and the command of the Military-Space Forces. At 
the end of March a Moscow press report claimed that work was 
proceeding on the Angara-24 heavy launcher project and that it 
will be launched from a new space center at Svobodnyy starting 
in 2000 or 2001 (MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA 31 Mar). RSA director 
Koptev stated that all of Russia's major space programs, 
including commercial launches of Western satellites as well as 
the international space station project, are planned for 
launches from the Baykonur Cosmodrome (Ostankino Television 
First Channel Network 1 Apr). On the issue of a new launch 
facility at Svobodnyy, Koptev announced officially that no 
decision has been taken by the Russian government to build an 
eastern cosmodrome. He stated that the government has directed 
only that a feasibility study of such a project be carried out 
and that the findings be reported this year. 
  Boris Ostroumov, RSA Deputy Director, repeated his previous 
criticism of the Far East cosmodrome plan on grounds of 
excessive costs and remoteness from space production centers. 
He also claimed that discussing such a plan at present would 
have a disrupting effect while the leasing agreement is being 
considered for ratification (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 1 Apr). Igor 
Barmin, chief designer at the Design Bureau of General Machine 
Building, also criticized the plan on grounds of high 
development costs, but agreed in principle that Russia should 
have its own low-latitude launch site for civil and military 
programs. 
  At the beginning of April a press agency report claimed that 
the viewpoint of the command of Russia's Military-Space Forces 
was different from that of the Russian government on the issue 
of the Svobodnyy cosmodrome. According to unnamed sources at 
the Space Forces' press Center, General Ivanov has directed the 
units at Svobodnyy to proceed with preparations for launching 
light payloads with Rokot boosters starting in 1996 (ITAR-TASS 1 
Apr).

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Thursday [7 April] Japan will allocate 11 million 
dollars to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear weapons, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Hosokawa made the announcement in a meeting with Kazakhstan 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who arrived in Japan on 
Wednesday for a four-day visit. 
  The amount is part of a total of 100 million dollars Japan 
pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics -- 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- dismantle their 
nuclear weapons. 
  The officials said detailed use of the 11 million dollars 
will be decided in discussions between the two sides at a 
committee on cooperation for the destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  Hosokawa praised Kazakhstan's efforts to denuclearize, 
democratize and shift toward a market-oriented economy, they 
said. 
  Kazakhstan joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
as a nonnuclear weapon state last November. 
  Nazarbayev, 53, asked for Japanese cooperation in helping 
his 
country tackle environmental pollution at the Semipalatinsk 
nuclear testing site and in the Aral Sea, the officials said. 
  Specifically, he requested cooperation in providing medical 
equipment for hospitals treating people exposed to radioactivity 
near Semipalatinsk. 
  Hosokawa said Japan will seriously consider cooperation with 
the hospitals, which the ministry officials said is expected to 
be covered by the 11 million dollars. 
  An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are 
believed to be left in Kazakhstan. 
  As for environmental problems in the Aral Sea, Hosokawa said 
the problem should be solved internationally but added Japan 
would study what it can do, the officials said. 
  Also during the 30-minute meeting, followed by an hourlong 
dinner, Nazarbayev, 53, said he supports Japan's bid to become a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  A joint statement signed by the two leaders prior to the 
meeting said Kazakhstan "expressed the hope" that Japan would 
become a permanent member of the Security Council and "fulfill 
its relevant responsibilities." 
  Hosokawa told Nazarbayev Japan intends to fulfill its 
responsibilities within its capabilities, the officials said. 
  On the international front, the Kazakhstan president 
proposed 
holding a conference covering the whole of Asia to build trust. 
  Hosokawa agreed on the importance of creating trust in Asia 
but expressed reluctance to set up a forum covering the whole 
region such as the conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  Nazarbayev asked Japan to offer its manufacturing technology 
to Central Asia and suggested setting up a committee between 
Japan and Kazakhstan to study such a possibility. 
  Hosokawa suggested the two sides utilize the existing 
bilateral economic committee. 
  Nazarbayev also offered a list of 1,394 Japanese prisoners 
of 
war detained in Siberia who died in Kazakhstan, the officials 
said. 
  On Friday, Nazarbayev is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko and give a press conference later in the day.

  [Text] Fighting between the Army of Serbian Republic [of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] and members of the so-called Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is taking place on a part of the front 
between Gorazde, Cajnice, and Foca. The worst fighting is 
taking place in the Obrecevo region and along the Drina river, 
between Vitkovici and Foca, where the Muslim units are trying to 
recapture the positions that they lost. 
  In addition to using all the available arms, the Muslims are 
also using chemical agents produced in the goldsmithing plant in 
Vitkovici. The Serbian military sources claim that these agents 
are produced with the most primitive technology. The Serbian 
fighters who crushed the strong Muslim offensive from Gorazde, 
involving some 10,000 well-armed Alija's [Izetbegovic] soldiers, 
are continuing to rout the Muslim forces from the torched 
Serbian villages on the right bank of the Drina.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 10 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led 
Bosnian presidency Saturday [9 April] evening accused Serbs of 
killing "many people" in a gas attack on the eastern Moslem-held 
enclave of Gorazde. 
  A spokesman for the presidency here was unable to give 
casualty figures, saying reports varied widely with some 
mentioning thousands of dead. 
  In Istanbul, Bosnian Vice-President Eyup Ganic told AFP that 
"hundreds" of people had been killed during the course of three 
chemical attacks on Gorazde on Saturday. "This is genocide 
under UN supervision," he said. 
  Ganic added that he would be flying to New York on Sunday, 
at 
the demand of President Alija Izetbegovic, to demand an 
emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs kept 
up heavy shelling of the beseiged Moslem enclave of Gorazde on 
Sunday after the breakdown of ceasefire talks, as a row 
developed over the use of chemical weapons there. 
  In Belgrade on Sunday, the agency SNRA said Bosnian Serb 
forces had seized two villages south of Gorazde and their 
commander was declaring himself ready to allow an evacuation of 
civilians from the Moslem enclave. [passage omitted] 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink confirmed Sunday that Serb 
shelling had destroyed a strategic bridge over the river Drina 
at Sadba, in the south of Gorazde. This would help any possible 
Serb capture of the south-east part of the enclave still held by 
the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, he said. 
  Serb guns also targetted a bridge in the Gorazde suburb of 
Bacci which had been hit by Serb artillery fire, along with 
three other heavily populated suburbs, Annink said. [passage 
omitted] 
  A shell fell 1,000 metres (yards) from the headquarters of 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the centre of Gorazde 
Saturday, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janovski said in Sarajevo. 
  Local people protested in front of its offices Saturday, 
handing in a petition which demanded "more energetic action" to 
defend Gorazde by the international community, he said. 
  In Zagreb, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees told AFP 
that more than 1,500 people fled in panic from intense Serb 
shelling in the southern area of the enclave Saturday night, 
streaming into Gorazde. 
  "There is real panic south of Gorazde and in the town 
itself," spokesman Peter Kessler said, adding that shelling had 
intensified Sunday morning. 
  Annink poured cold water on accusations by Bosnian leaders 
that the enclave had been hit by chemical gas. "We think it was 
smoke grenades, probably M84s for 120mm mortar guns," he said. 
  The Bosnian presidency accused Serbs Saturday evening of 
killing "many people" in a gas attack. 
  Bosnian Serb military leaders denied the charges, accusing 
the Bosnian army of using tear gas in the Bokovo region earlier 
this month. [passage omitted] 
  Serb troops seized two villages in the south of the Gorazde 
enclave, according to a report by the agency SRNA. The troops 
took Djindici and Zupcici, which the agency described as "Moslem 
strongholds." Serb forces now hoped to repulse the mainly 
Moslem Bosnian government forces from heights around the 
Oglecevo region in the south of the enclave, it said. 
  The Serb commander said he was ready to allow the evacuation 
of civilians wishing to leave the enclave as far as the village 
of Osjecani, where they would be handed over to United Nations 
troops, the agency said. 
  The agency SRNA said fighting between the two sides was 
continuing Sunday along front lines on the Drina river, on which 
both the captured villages are situated. Bosnian Serb forces 
also routed Moslem troops in the north of the enclave at Kopac, 
SRNA said. [passage omitted]
