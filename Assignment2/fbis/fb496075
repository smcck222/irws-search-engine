<F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta report: "Viruses Kept by the Army Could </F>
Have Killed on a Large-Scale; Research Requested by Military 
Secret Services of the USSR"] 
  [Text] Prague -- In the 70's and 80's Czechoslovak 
scientists in military establishments studied several dozen 
particularly dangerous exotic viruses and bacteria that could be 
used as lethal bacteriological weapons. Their collection was 
only liquidated by the Army, along with all common viruses such 
as influenza or mumps, in February 1994. 
  The dangerous viruses and bacteria studied by Czechoslovak 
experts belonged to the group that mainly cause severe cases of 
meningitis. The military officials of the former Eastern Bloc 
states were allegedly convinced that these organisms could be 
used by the enemy in the event of a bacteriological war. The 
military secret services of the former USSR therefore designated 
several dozen particularly dangerous microorganisms and 
recommended their research with the aim of creating serums for 
diagnostic and protective purposes. 
  Following the liquidation of the bank of virus strains, the 
Ministry of Defense was accused of having developed 
bacteriological weapons in its military establishments. The 
Army command, along with the Ministry of Health, denied this, 
however. The Ministry of Defense stated that the research 
involving those viruses was of a purely defensive nature. Some 
experts argue, however, that it is virtually impossible to 
distinguish between defensive and offensive research. 
  According to expert circles, it cannot be ruled out that the 
results of Czechoslovak studies could have been used by the 
Soviet Union for military purposes. This suspicion is confirmed 
by the recent admission of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, chief of the 
Russian presidential committee for chemical and biological 
weapons, who confirmed last September that, even though Moscow 
had signed the treaty on banning these weapons, the former USSR 
and, subsequently, Russia, continued to develop for 20 years 
bacteriological weapons and aircraft and missile systems for 
their transport.

<F P=106> ["km"-signed report: "Czech Scientists Reportedly Never </F>
Tried To Develop Biological Weapons"] 
  [Text] Prague -- The dangerous organisms that 
Czechoslovak scientists were studying in military establishments 
in the seventies and eighties included, for example, the Muray 
Valley encephalitis virus, which originates in Australia; a 
virus called St. Louis encephalitis; bacteria of the Japanese B 
encephalitis, strain "schun" [word as published]; or the virus 
of the "murman" seal species. These microorganisms cause mainly 
inflammations of the meninx; they have a very severe clinical 
progression and a lethal conclusion. The former Soviet Union 
asked the former government for an analysis of the above 
microorganisms. 
  Czech scientists supposedly never worked with the most 
dangerous infections such as smallpox, pestilence, or anthrax. 
  According to Ales Macela, dean of scientific activity at the 
Jan Evangelista Purkyne Military Medical Academy in Hradec 
Kralove, conditions have never been established in the Czech 
Republic for handling of genetic material of microorganisms or 
for the production of a larger quantity of microbes, which would 
have been necessary for the development and production of a 
biological weapon.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 6 (CTK) -- A NATO inspection team 
confirmed today that Slovakia has dismantled 44 tanks in 
accordance with an international treaty on reducing the number 
of conventional weapons in Europe. 
  According to a Vienna Convention on Reducing Conventional 
Arms in Europe, Slovakia must dismantle 423 tanks by November 
1995. 
  One of the 44 tanks was not dismantled or disarmed, but is 
destined for display in a museum. 
  According to the agreement, next year the Slovak Army should 
have 46,667 soldiers, 478 combat tanks, 683 armored vehicles, 
383 artillery pieces, 115 combat aircraft, and 25 combat 
helicopters.

  [Text] Military sources close to Yemeni Defense Minister 
Haytham Qasim have said in Aden that the north Yemenis have 
imported various types of chemical weapons and ammunition from 
East European states through a Jewish arms dealer known for his 
close ties with Zionist circles that are very active in these 
states. 
  Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa categorically denied this. 
They said such claims tarnish the image of Yemen and obstruct 
the implementation of the pledge and accord document signed in 
Amman to achieve Yemeni reconciliation. Defense Ministry 
sources in Sanaa said an officer called Col. 'Ali al-Hadi, a 
member of the south Yemeni Socialist Party and armament director 
at the Defense Ministry, is currently in an East European state 
to make a deal to purchase long-range missiles against the will 
of the Defense Ministry in Sanaa. 
  In another development, Yemeni newspapers spoke about a 
recent clash between the northern and southern forces in the 
Shabwah area in southern Yemen, in which five were killed. A 
north Yemeni source, however, said it was a clash between tribes 
and only two were killed.

<F P=106> [Faysal Makram and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah report: "Aden: </F>
Sanaa Importing Chemical Weapons"] 
  [Excerpt] Sanaa, Aden -- A statement issued by the Defense 
Ministry in Aden accuses "the economic military establishment in 
the capital, Sanaa, of importing various types of 
internationally banned chemical weapons and ammunition from a 
number of East European countries." 
  The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in Aden 
yesterday, says: "These weapons and ammunition are imported 
through a Jewish dealer who has strong links and ties with the 
Zionist centers of influence formed recently in a number of East 
European states." 
  The statement, which falls within the framework of the 
resumption of media campaigns between the southern forces 
supporting the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the northern 
forces supporting the General People's Congress, describes "the 
weapons brought to Yemen recently as weapons of mass destruction 
like those which have been and are still being destroyed in Iraq 
and which are banned in other states." 
  The statement says: "The military-economic establishment is 
a close commercial establishment controlled directly by the 
ruling military family in Sanaa. It controls most trade 
activities in the republic without the knowledge of the 
government and the House of Representatives." 
  The YSP, which controls Aden, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
[YRG], which is led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, 
speaker of the House of Representatives, traded accusations 
yesterday. The YRG said that houses belonging to its supporters 
in Aden has been stormed, while security sources in the city 
said that large quantities of weapons had been confiscated in 
hideouts in the city. 
  The sources added that "the security services in Aden have 
over the past two days discovered large quantities of weapons 
which were smuggled in secretly and delivered to terrorist 
elements belonging to the Jihad organization in Yemen." The 
sources said that "interrogations of the suspects accused of 
acquiring the weapons have shown that they belong to a major 
Islamic party in the country" -- a clear reference to the YRG.

  [Text] Last month, the British SUNDAY TIMES came up with 
allegations that Russia is developing biological weapons. The 
Russian Defense Ministry has strongly denied the allegations. 
Nevertheless, THE WASHINGTON POST has issued the same statement 
again recently. Vladislav Kozyakov comments: 
  What is surprising is that the authors of the publications 
about a biological weapons program allegedly under way in Russia 
refer to the White House, sources which in their turn quote 
statements by some anonymous defectors from Russia. And, 
moreover, the authors contradict each other. For one, an 
anonymous author says in THE WASHINGTON POST that he has got all 
the necessary evidence that the program exists, while another 
author states in the same newspaper that there is no evidence to 
prove the charges and therefore it can be only non-military 
equipment that should be dismantled as well. 
  Hence, a question arises -- what are the reasons for 
spreading such unfounded accusations concerning the Russian 
policy in the American mass media, with reference to the 
administration's officials? 
  An agreement is effective between Russia, the United States, 
and Britain on mutual visits to biological facilities of the 
three countries. Russian experts visited several facilities of 
the kind in the United States in February-March this year. 
British and American experts carried out similar inspections in 
Russia in 1992, last October, and last January. They were 
allowed to visit any laboratories and talk with employees and 
take pictures as well. And Western experts revealed no claims 
as to the observance of the 1972 convention banning biological 
weapons. 
  As for visiting American biological facilities, Russian 
experts faced serious obstacles. For one, they were not allowed 
into a number of laboratories and one building of a former plant 
of the (Phaser) firm, producing biological weapons. Certain 
restrictions were posed on them to take pictures and they were 
also denied to make biological tests. One of the facilities was 
opened for inspection only after the Russian Embassy interfered. 
Besides, experts from Russia found out that the (Phaser) firm 
not only preserved but was modernizing the equipment designed 
earlier to produce biological warfare formulas. The information 
to that effect has been published in the Moscow-based newspaper 
IZVESTIYA. 
  Apparently there is only one way to provide strict 
observance 
of the 1972 convention banning biological weapons. The sides 
should work out a more effective control mechanism over the 
convention's implementation. Russia, for its part, intends to 
help promote the idea at the forthcoming session of the 
preparatory committee dealing with the control measures to 
observe the convention. Will the Western countries be ready for 
a stricter control system?

  [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, an official representative of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, dismissed on Thursday allegations by 
foreign media that Russia continues to work on the creation of 
biological weapons. 
  Such publications "are clearly aimed at destroying mutual 
trust, and at aggravating relations between the signatories of 
the Convention banning biological weapons," he said at a 
briefing in Moscow. 
  Karasin noted that Russia as legal successor of the USSR 
took 
all responsibility for the implementation of the 1972 
Convention, including the functions of a guarantor of this 
document. Under the trilateral agreements between Russia, USA 
and Great Britain, mutual visits to biological facilities and 
exchange of information continue between the sides. 
  Karasin also said that Russia is in favor of the creation of 
a control mechanism for the implementation of the Convention. A 
special conference on this issue will be convened in Geneva in 
September.

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- "The committee for conventions on 
chemical and biological weapons under the Russian president 
agreed to the transportation and storage of poisonous substances 
in a major populated area. That is why its chief Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich was dismissed by presidential decree." This was the 
explanation of the wording of Kuntsevich's dismissal "for a 
single gross violation of duties" given by the head of state's 
press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov at a briefing in the Kremlin 
today. 
  Moreover, Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that Anatoliy Kuntsevich 
had spent many years working on the creation of chemical weapons 
and "it is difficult for a person to part from his child even if 
the child is dangerous." For this reason, the president's press 
secretary said, the person dealing with the destruction of the 
chemical arsenal should not be one who was involved in its 
creation.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Academician Kuntsevich Learned of </F>
His Dismissal in a Telephone Call from IZVESTIYA"] 
  [Text] The Russian president's Press Service disseminated 
a report through ITAR-TASS channels that "a presidential edict 
has released from his post Anatoliy Demyanovich Kuntsevich, 
chairman of the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and 
Biological Weapons under the Russian Federation president." It 
also pointed out that A. Kuntsevich has been released from his 
post "for a single gross violation of work duties." 
  The Press Service did not explain what kind of violation 
this 
was, and Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press 
secretary, said at a briefing that there were such violations. 
But Kuntsevich's closest colleagues do not know of them, and he 
himself, so he declared in conversation with me, had not heard 
about this and learned of his dismissal only in a call from 
IZVESTIYA's editorial office. 
  Let us leave aside this, not the first occasion when someone 
released from a high state post learns of this from press 
reports. Particularly a prominent scientist who is one of the 
creators of the most sophisticated Soviet chemical weapons, 
winner of the Lenin Prize, hero of socialist labor, lieutenant 
general, and academician who, at the end of his scientific 
career, resolutely set about destroying these weapons. 
  Let us ask ourselves a different question: Why, after all, 
has Academician Kuntsevich been removed from his post, and what 
true reason hides behind the vague wording "single gross 
violation of work duties?" 
  There are several answers to this question. One version was 
suggested by observers: Kuntsevich has suffered...for the 
complete failure of the case of chemical scientist Vil 
Mirzayanov, which he supposedly initiated. In conversation with 
me the academician categorically denied his involvement in the 
"Mirzayanov case," although he has repeatedly and harshly 
condemned Mirzayanov's action. 
  In any case, the responsibility for that shameful trial 
lies, 
in my opinion, with the law enforcement organs. 
  The reason for Academician Kuntsevich's dismissal lies far 
deeper than it seems. It lies in our country's economic and 
technical inability and unpreparedness to fulfill its 
international obligations to destroy chemical weapons. 
  The program for the destruction of these weapons has not yet 
been approved either by parliament or by the government. The 
funding of all measures connected with preparations for the 
direct salvaging of toxins and ammunition is proceeding 
extremely irregularly and plainly inadequately, not to mention 
the actual program of their destruction. This year alone the 
preparations to rid Russia of chemical weapons are to cost 10.4 
billion [currency not specified], but this [money] simply does 
not exist. 
  Academician Kuntsevich was categorically opposed to the 
destruction of chemical weapons without resolving social 
problems and without guarantees for the population resident in 
the places where they are stored and where it is proposed to 
salvage them. But sufficient funds have not been found for just 
these purposes. The program is slipping and is today under 
threat of being wrecked. 
  The Convention Committee tried to find nonbudgetary funds to 
implement the chemical disarmament program. In many ways it 
succeeded. We were given assistance in resolving these problems 
by the United States (the total amount exceeded $60 million for 
the development of a safe and efficient technology for the 
destruction of toxins), the FRG, Sweden, and the EEC, and 
contacts were initiated with NATO. I am not sure if they will 
be broken off with Kuntsevich's departure from his post, but 
they will certainly be complicated somewhat -- the academician's 
authority in international scientific circles is very great. 
  One thing remains beyond doubt -- by signing the Convention 
on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons in Paris in 1993 along 
with 155 other states, Russia assumed juridical obligations to 
start parting with them in two years' time. It will hardly be 
able to keep to this deadline.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional narcotics developments monitored through 3 
April. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  After five years of eluding the police, Cesare Ciulla, an 
Italian national wanted by Italian police and charged with 
trafficking large quantities of cocaine from Bolivia, was 
finally captured in a house in northern Santa Fe de Bogota. 
Ciulla is believed to be a prominent member of the Italian 
mafia's Ciulla family--one of the most important drug 
trafficking families operating in Italy. After three months of 
bilateral intelligence cooperation, Italian and Colombian 
authorities were finally able to establish that Ciulla was 
moving around the city, passing himself off as another member of 
the Italian community living in Santa Fe de Bogota. (Santa Fe 
de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0000 GMT 30 
Mar 94) 
  Cucuta police arrested two Venezuelan nationals carrying 80 
kg of cocaine paste. The men were arrested while driving along 
the highway leading from Cucuta to Puerto Santander, a border 
community northwest of Cucuta. According to an official police 
report, the drugs were hidden in a secret compartment in the 
vehicle's door. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 29 Mar

  Agents assigned to the Turbo port authority seized 26 kg of 
cocaine on a Panamanian-registered freighter anchored in the 
Gulf of Uraba. The cocaine was hidden inside three sealed 
fiberglass boxes in the ship's rudder. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 9A) 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  The rupture of a heroin packet inside the stomach of a drug 
runner has enabled OIJ (Judicial Investigation Agency) agents to 
break up a drug trafficking group operating between Costa Rica 
and the United States. According to the OIJ, the organization 
was made up of American and Colombian nationals who were 
transporting heroin and cocaine inside their stomachs. Costa 
Rican authorities believe that between 1992 and early 1994, the 
group smuggled nearly $530 million colones worth of heroin. 
(San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 23 Mar 94 p 18A) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>

discovered and destroyed by Finance Police in the community of 
Melchor de Mencos, Peten Department, along the border with 
Belize. Police report that the first plantation was valued at 2 
million quetzals and growing 6,000 marijuana plants, while the 
other plantation was valued at 7 million quetzals. No arrests

plantations and arrested eight suspected drug traffickers in the 
Morelia municipalities of Churumuco and Tiquicheo. Mario Ayon 
Rodriguez, commander of the 21st Military Region, reported that 
no gunfire was exchanged during the two operation and that 
several vehicles and high-caliber weapons were confiscated. The 
military commander also said that two U.S. nationals were also 
arrested as they were preparing to transport the drug to the 
United States. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 
28 Mar 94 p 9A) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  Recent figures disclosed by the General Customs Directorate 
show 300 kg of various drugs valued at $10.5 million were seized 
in the first quarter of the year. According to a report by the 
Customs Directorate, most of the drugs were seized in March, 
with cocaine comprising the largest portion. The report also 
states that in addition to the aforementioned quantity of drugs, 
customs agents also seized 2,425 ml of liquid cocaine and 125 ml

  [Text] La Paz, 26 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora announced his withdrawal from politics today. 
The announcement came after a police investigation linking him 
to drug-trafficking activities. 
  In a televised address to the nation, Paz Zamora said during 
his term in office (1989-1993) "there was no crime, but there 
were errors," in reference to his relations with Isac Chavarria, 
alias Oso, allegedly Bolivia's most notorious drug trafficker. 
  Paz Zamora appeared dispirited on the television screen. He 
stood as he dramatically delivered his statement beside a 
crucifix. 
  The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking 
[Fuerza Especial de Luchas Contra el Narcotrafico--FELCN] 
revealed this week there are indications that during his 
presidential administration, Paz Zamora received and obeyed 
instructions from Chavarria to appoint officers in the Armed 
Forces and the government. 
  FELCN also delivered to a parliamentary commission a report 
indicating relatives of the former president as well as 
distinguished members of the social democratic Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left [MIR], Paz Zamora's party, gave protection to 
the drug trafficker. 
  Among the accused are Susana Seleme, Paz Zamora's secretary 
when he was president, and MIR leader Oscar Eid. 
  Colonel Faustino Rico Toro, who in 1991 was appointed 
commander in chief of the antidrug struggle, was arrested on 22 
March. The U.S. Government asked the Bolivian Government for 
his extradition on drug-trafficking charges on 23 March. 
  In announcing his withdrawal from politics, Paz Zamora, 
current vice president of Socialist International, acknowledged 
implicitly his relations with Chavarria but said he always acted 
in "good faith, close to naivete." 
  Several MIR leaders and relatives of the former president 
have admitted an old friendship united Chavarria and Paz Zamora 
who appear together in various old pictures the media have 
published. 
  Although he admitted his "mistakes," Paz Zamora said today 
he 
is astonished by certain people's "intention to treat 
maliciously" his personal relations, referring to his relations 
with Chavarria, who is in La Paz' maximum security prison. 
  The president said the charges against him "have not been 
proved" and accused his accusers of "tarnishing my family's 
honor." 
  The former president said he is concerned only with "the 
international impact" the charges against him and his party may 
have. He said "an effort is being made now to deny the results 
of the antidrug struggle" that his government waged, a struggle 
that has been acknowledged by the international community, he 
claimed. 
  Since handing the Presidency over to Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada following the 6 June 1993 elections, Paz Zamora has 
secluded himself in his private residence in the town of Tarija, 
on the border with Argentina. 
  He made his only public appearance today since then. It came 
several months after the first reports of the drug-trafficking 
charges against his party, charges that in the past few days 
have centered on him.

  [Text] Former President Jaime Paz Zamora has announced his 
definitive withdrawal from political life and his party 
leadership. Paz Zamora was distressed by the numerous 
accusations that he permitted the creation of a drug trafficking 
network within his administration and that many of the leaders 
of his party participated in it. Jaime Paz Zamora sent the media 
a recorded message in which he said he did not commit any 
crimes, he only made mistakes in good faith. 
  [Begin recording] [Paz Zamora] My dear fellow countrymen, 
from the day of my last speech during the inauguration on 6 
August of 1993... 
  [Unidentified reporter interrupts] Paz's face was slimmer. 
The dramatic moment showed on the former president. He is 
obviously affected by the drama afflicting his party and many 
important MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] leaders. 
Jaime Paz Zamora faced the camera sure that millions of citizens 
would hear his definitive decision to withdraw from political 
life. He was overwhelmed by the accusations made by the Special 
Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] that he permitted the alleged 
coverup of drug trafficking activities during his government and 
that some of the leaders of his party had direct participation 
in it. 
  He was firm at the beginning of his message and had a 
hopeless look at the end. The former president used his farewell 
speech to try to instill hope in citizens who today have major 
doubts about his performance as head of state. 
  [Paz Zamora] I want to give my version of the latest reports 
linking us with drug trafficking that have shocked the country. 
The first thing I want to say on this matter, with all clarity 
and firmness, is that we never committed any crime. But just as 
clearly I must recognize, dear fellow countrymen, that there 
were mistakes, lack of prudence, or incorrect appreciation of 
situations and behavior. I also must admit to maintaining 
relations with some people in a good faith that was close to 
naivete. 
  [Reporter] Jaime Paz Zamora later said that it seems there 
are too many ill-intentioned attitudes. It seems that it is not 
important to seek the truth but to inflict political damage, he 
added. I cannot permit, he said, that by tarnishing my dignity 
as a former president that the issue will continue tarnishing my 
country's dignity. 
  [Paz Zamora] Dear fellow countrymen, listen to me well. With 
the same love and respect I always had for you, with calm and 
firmness, I want to announce that I have made the undeclinable 
decision to withdraw from the party leadership and national 
political activities. You have known me for many years. I have 
always acted in good faith, with good will, in all matters and 
with all people. I have acted under the guidance of moral 
principles that I learned from my family and the Bolivian 
people. Achievements have a prize; mistakes produce consequences 
that must be admitted with honor and dignity. 
  [Reporter] This is what Jaime Paz Zamora said on 26 March. 
He 
did not want to answer questions. This is why he sent the 
recorded message to the most important radio and television 
stations and newspapers. The man who founded MIR on 7 September 
1971, who for many years was an active and charismatic leader, 
who was almost killed during an attack because he was an alleged 
nuisance to the 1980 dictatorship, the man who on 6 August 1989 
was sworn in as president of the Republic was thus withdrawing 
from political life. He assured and admitted to the people that 
he had made mistakes but did not commit any crime. [end

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Mar (EFE) -- The Bolivian Government 
today denied statements by former Bolivian President Jaime Paz 
Zamora, who claimed investigations into his alleged ties with 
drug trafficking activities had "political designs" and were 
"malicious" in nature. 
  The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking 
[Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotrafico--FELCN] has 
disclosed evidence indicating that Paz Zamora received and 
obeyed instructions from alleged drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" 
Echevarria. The FELCN also reported the alleged ties of several 
leaders of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) with 
drug trafficking activities during Paz Zamora's administration 
(1989-1993). 
  In a short communique, the Ministry of Social Communications 
said, "The FELCN investigations against several MIR leaders are 
not political in nature and, instead, result from the law's 
mandate." 
  In a message to the nation broadcast Saturday night, Paz 
Zamora asserted, "it seems this case is being given perverse 
treatment." He also said the charges against him were 
"ill-intentioned" and attempted "to cause political damage and 
slander the dignity of the people." 
  The government, however, said, "actions have to be carried 
out in the future by the judicial branch and, in some cases, by 
the legislative branch," to clarify the charges. Regarding Paz 
Zamora's "irrevocable resignation" announcement saying that he 
would withdraw from politics, the Social Communications Ministry 
said this is Paz Zamora's "personal decision" and that the 
people will be the ones to judge it.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora's "irrevocable" resignation from political life 
over his and his party's alleged involvement in trafficking has 
surprised Bolivian political circles. 
  Senate President Juan Carlos Duran, the top leader of the 
ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), said Paz 
Zamora's decision to withdraw from political life is personal. 
  Duran said the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) must 
now weigh the situation and define its political future. 
  Miguel Urioste, acting president of the social democratic 
Free Bolivia Movement (MBL)--which is allied to the MNR--said 
the time is not right "to prey on a fallen man" because this 
would hurt the image of Bolivian democracy, adding that "history 
will judge what has happened." 
  Deputy Ricardo Paz Ballivian, of the opposition Conscience 
of 
the Fatherland (Condepa), regretted Paz Zamora's decision, 
adding that the former president was "deeply affected" by 
accusations against him and his family. 
  "A party is an institution that cannot disappear because it 
is an alternative for the Bolivian people," said Paz Ballivan 
regarding the MIR--the party he founded--and its future. 
  Deputy Jerjes Justiniano, of the leftist Democratic 
Socialism 
Alternative (ASD), said Paz Zamora is a "scapegoat" for things 
done by some MIR leaders, adding that "institutions are not bad, 
only the men leading them are bad." 
  Jorge Landivar Roca, head of the Nationalist Democratic 
Action (ADN)--a former MIR ally and member of the ruling 
coalition that governed the country between 1989 and 1993--said 
Paz Zamora's recognition of mistakes during his presidency was 
an act of "courage." 
  Current MIR President Oscar Eid--who is also involved in the 
trafficking report--said his party will not discuss its 
immediate future until the investigations on the alleged 
"narco-links" are concluded. 
  Eid said that when undisputable MIR leader Paz Zamora 
resigned, the party lost its main "orientation." Eid added: 
"Our former leader recognized his mistakes with dignity and 
courage. Just as achievements receive praise, errors have a 
cost." 
  MIR block leader Carlos Borth said party followers are 
disoriented and paralyzed by their leader's resignation and the 
accusations against various MIR leaders. 
  Borth said he will ask for an emergency meeting to analyze 
Eid's possible separation and to form a new executive board. 
  During the week MIR leaders testified before the Justice and 
Judicial Police Committee of the Bolivian Congress, the body 
responsible for investigating the alleged "narco-links." 
  Paz Zamora is considered to have the most important 
international career of the past years. He issued a dramatic 
message on 26 March ending his political career under the burden 
of accusations linking him with drug trafficking.

  [Text] The Special Antinarcotics Force's [FELCN] report has 
provoked a political storm. The report mercilessly tarnished the 
image of former President Jaime Paz Zamora and important 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR] leaders. As a result, 
Jaime Paz Zamora announced his irrevocable withdrawal from 
political life. 
  The population was surprised by the FELCN report's summary 
of 
conclusions. It obviously had the sharp advice of intelligent 
experts and probably the DEA itself. 
  The document says drug trafficker and Army Captain Isaac Oso 
Chavarria, who was trained as an intelligence officer by the 
Army, used his personal relations with Jaime Paz Zamora and his 
family to create a drug trafficking network within Paz Zamora's 
administration. The MIR leaders involved tried to hide their 
links with Chavarria when the real nature of Chavarria's 
business became known, but Chavarria used that fear to blackmail 
them, the document says. 
  These MIR leaders were involved in illegal activities to 
protect Chavarria against FELCN efforts to uncover his 
activities. Chavarria had legal immunity until the advent of the 
new government. 
  The report says that Chavarria's links with MIR leaders were 
financial as well as personal. Chavarria was a MIR follower and 
had easy access to MIR leaders. We must point out that these 
links were not established by the MIR as a party and most MIR 
followers were unaware of them, the report says, adding that the 
evidence does not incriminate the MIR as a party in Chavarria's 
activities. The MIR cannot be accused of involvement in drug 
trafficking activities. When the report mentions the MIR and its 
links with Chavarria it only refers to the party leadership, the 
document says. 
  When studying the chronology of events, it is clear that MIR 
leaders were willing to accept Chavarria's hospitality, 
financial infrastructure, and resources even before Paz Zamora 
was elected president. Once in power this relationship 
continued, although in a more discreet manner, because MIR 
leaders realized they were politically dangerous, particularly 
after then-Senator Juan Lucio's revelations. 
  During the MIR administration, Chavarria and other drug 
traffickers continued paying bribe money to high-ranking MIR 
leaders, the document says. The bribes were delivered through 
middlemen such as Chavarria employees Edgar Fernandez and Luis 
Capobianco. Paz Zamora's sisters presumably also acted as links 
to carry messages and set up meetings between Chavarria and the 
president, the report adds. 
  The report says that in October 1990, MIR leaders and 
presidential personal secretary Susana Seleme, speaking on 
behalf of the president, prevented a FELCN raid on a house owned 
by Chavarria in Ilpavi and in November 1990 ordered FELCN to 
free Edgar Fernandez, thus interrupting the investigation of 
Chavarria's businesses. 
  In April 1991, acting MIR President Oscar Eid paid 
Chavarria's hospital bills. At that time Chavarria had enough 
money not only to pay his hospital bill but also to buy the 
entire hospital, the report says. 
  In February 1994, MIR leaders threatened fugitive Edgar 
Fernandez' family members to prevent him from revealing anything 
about MIR leaders' links to Chavarria. The report says Chavarria 
conspired to create a drug trafficking network within Paz 
Zamora's administration. The most notable expression of 
Chavarria's influence was the appointment of Colonel Faustino 
Rico Toro to head FELCN. With that appointment Chavarria 
intended to control and neutralize FELCN's struggle against drug 
trafficking. The report says Chavarria considered Faustino Rico 
Toro a drug trafficking partner by at least 1983. 
  The report says Chavarria allegedly pressured President Paz 
Zamora into appointing Rico Toro to the very important and 
delicate post in February 1991. The appointment completed the 
narco-influence network established by Chavarria that included 
presidential aides chief Colonel Jorge Coco Velazquez and Seized 
Goods Director Choco Saucedo. 
  In 1983, Chavarria deposited $1.2 million in a Rico Toro 
account. The two were partners at least as of that date. The 
same year Chavarria purchased Rico Toro's condominium in 
Florida, in the United States. Chavarria received a house that 
belonged to Rico Toro in Ilpadi, La Paz, as payment for a drug 
trafficking debt. Rico Toro tried to repurchase the house when 
he was named FELCN chief, but Chavarria refused to sell it back 
to him. 
  Rico Toro was one of [former military dictator] Luis Garcia 
Meza's assistants. He received $200,000 for his loyalty to the 
regime. The report says Chavarria tried to influence the 
appointment of military officers to important positions through 
presidential aides chief Col. Jorge Coco Velazquez. 
  The report concludes that Seized Goods Director Choco 
Saucedo 
was part of Chavarria's drug trafficking influence network. 
Saucedo sold confidential information on investigations of the 
activities of Colombian drug traffickers to Bolivian drug 
traffickers.

  [Text] Government and coca growers representatives have 
signed an agreement to end the tense situation in the Chapare 
tropical region. The five-article document ratifies the two 
parties' desire to fight trafficking and to prevent the 
eradication of plantations. It confirms that the government will 
continue to look for and destroy laboratories but without 
destroying coca plantations. 
  Article 4 is the most controversial: It specifies that the 
government and coca-growers leaders will implement Articles 10, 
14 and 24 of Law 1008. The government is committed to implement 
alternative development programs. 
  It has also been agreed that mixed commissions will be 
created to deal with issues related to coca-leaf production. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Are you happy with 
the agreement? 
  [Unidentified coca growers leader] We believe there is an 
agreement, but we will only be happy when the terms of the 
agreement are complied with. [end recording] 
  The coca growers believe this agreement represents victory 
for them because the government has promised not to forcefully 
eradicate the sacred leaf. 
  [Begin unidentified coca growers leader recording] Forceful 
eradication without an alternative crop cannot flourish. [end 
recording] 
  The government believes the agreement will ensure peace and 
the implementation of alternative development in the 
coca-producing regions.

  [Text] Cobija, 15 Mar (ANF) -- According to a "sincere and 
painful confession" made by Colonel Mario Flores Alanez, the new 
Pando Police Department commander who has become the terror of 
drug traffickers and criminals in less than one month, the 
passivity of officials has allowed drug traffickers to 
infiltrate the Pando Police Department. 
  Commenting on recent counternarcotics operations in 
Trinidad--joint forces operations that took everyone here by 
surprise--Col. Flores said: "As I have reported to my 
superiors, I must confess that our command did not offer any 
guarantees. Drug traffickers were informed about our actions. 
I have expressly requested the transfer and even discharge of 
some officers charged with specific felonies." 
  According to the police chief, the infiltration of drug 
traffickers has caused the failure of at least two operations in 
recent weeks. In view of this situation, he was compelled to 
make changes in the Police Intelligence Department. Only then 
was he able to arrest eight drug distributors. Nevertheless, 
and despite the adoption of strict measures, at the last minute 
he almost lost his prisoners when some relatives and groups 
hired by drug traffickers promoted a riot to try to free those 
under arrest. 
  Police are looking into this riot against the police, which 
was intended to look like a spontaneous action. Col. Flores 
said that at first even the local civic committee was involved, 
"but fortunately everything has been cleared up." 
  Based mainly on the testimony of those arrested, it has been 
established that in Pando there is an organization operating in 
different circles with the direct or indirect support of groups 
in power that are acting knowingly or unknowingly. 
  The investigation started with the arrest of drug users who 
identified the places where the merchandise was sold and drug 
distributors. After their arrest, the latter in turn supplied 
information on the drug distribution networks and the obtaining 
of supplies from the country's interior. As a result, one of 
the leaders of this group was arrested in Trinidad. He has been 
identified as Desiderio Rodriguez, who two weeks ago transported 
a cocaine shipment from Santa Cruz to Cochabamba. 
  Rodriguez reportedly supplied valuable information on drug 
suppliers and drug trafficking financiers, among whom are 
well-known people in the region. It has been learned that a 
common fund was established to purchase drugs and "huge" profits 
were distributed among the investors who pretend to ignore how 
their money is illegally used. 
  The investigations in Pando will continue in greater depth 
because it has been confirmed that a Special Antinarcotics Force 
unit has been installed in Trinidad.

  [Excerpts] The Special Antinarcotics Fight [FELCN] command 
destroyed on 19 March one of the largest cocaine processing 
laboratories that have been found in the last few years. In an 
operation called "Canaveral" which took place at 1330 on 18 
March, the FELCN found the laboratory located 5 km in a straight 
line west from Viru Viru Airport, near the Sanchez valley. The 
FELCN could not, however, arrest any of those who had been 
processing the drugs until a few minutes before the operation. 
The laboratory had the capacity of processing some 300 kg of 
cocaine per week with a degree of purity that is not common in 
our country. 
  The FELCN had been informed that a cocaine shipment had left 
the laboratory to be sent to Brazil. The FELCN agents 
nevertheless found more than 500 kg of cocaine in various 
processing stages at the site. According to experts, the drugs 
were being processed in accordance with severe norms aimed at 
obtaining an ideal substance for export. The laboratory was 
inside a nearly 20 hectare farm planted mostly with sugarcane. 
The La Belgica sugar mill is 15 km from this laboratory. 
  FELCN District Commander Colonel Hector Frias Cardozo did 
not 
reveal the names of those arrested in relation with this 
operation, but it has been unofficially reported that at least 
four suspects have been identified. A second stage of this 
operation is still being conducted at the capital of Santa Cruz 
Department, to identify the owner of the farm and those who are 
involved in the illegal activity. Apparently the laboratory has 
been operating at the site for at least one year. [passage 
omitted] 
  Together with the drugs, the FELCN agents burned 90 liters 
of 
ammonia, 13 kg of potassium permanganate, two kg of caustic 
soda, 200 kg of calcium chloride, 175 liters of sulphuric ether, 
50 liters of sulphuric acid, seven kg of manitol, and 400 liters 
of acetone. [passage omitted]

  [Text] We have a report from our agency, the Fides News 
Agency, on Carmelo Meco Dominguez' testimony that we think our 
listeners should hear. 
  The U.S. Embassy and the DEA tried to involve former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora in drug trafficking in 1990 by 
violently torturing Carmelo Meco Dominguez, seeking to force him 
to incriminate the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] 
leadership in trafficking activities. 
  This revelation was made public yesterday when MIR Deputy 
Mario Rueda Pena released a tape of a recorded voluntary 
declaration by Meco Dominguez at the La Paz Departmental Command 
of the Special Antinarcotics Force on 1 October 1990. 
  Meco says in his voluntary deposition that a few days before 
1 October he was kidnapped from his home by U.S. agents who 
tortured him violently, seeking to get him to accuse the 
then-President Jaime Paz Zamora and other MIR leaders of 
involvement in drug trafficking. 
  Could this just be a show organized by the DEA with 
information obtained through torture? It is a very serious 
accusation. Legislators should ask Meco Dominguez during his 
testimony at the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon if the 
accusations against Jaime Paz Zamora were obtained through 
torture. The press must report everything. We do not want 
stories here, and least of all stories about gringos who torture 
people. Do you not agree? They can torture in their country if 
they want, but not in ours.

  [Text] In less than one month forces of the Rural Mobile 
Patrol Unit (UMOPAR) have found and destroyed in the Chapare 
area 62 cocaine laboratories or ponds used for processing coca 
leaves into cocaine base. 
  This information was provided by Mario Soliz, secretary of 
social defense. At the same time he pointed out that in view of 
this situation the National Directorate of Agricultural 
Reconversion (DIRECO) has begun the eradication of illegal 
fields of coca leaves in areas near the laboratories. 
  Soliz said that between 400 and 500 bundles of already 
macerated coca leaves had been found, as well as about 40 
bundles of leaves which were being macerated. In the same place 
were found two wells, acid, permanganate, two containers, and 
all of the other equipment normally found in this kind of place. 
  Soliz emphasized: "According to the report prepared by the 
National Directorate of Coca Cultivation, a few meters from the 
wells were at least 5 hectares of coca plants." There were 5.1 
hectares of illegal coca plants in all, of which 3.7 hectares 
were located near Senda Bayer and 1.4 hectares near the 
community of Sebastian Pagador. 
<H5>  Locations Where Laboratories Were Destroyed </H5>
  Furthermore, Soliz explained that the 62 ponds and 
laboratories were found and destroyed in 13 communities in the 
Chapare area. 
  At Uncia 13 ponds were destroyed on 21 January 1994; in 
Mariscal, one pond, 24 January 1994; in Villa Barrientos, one 
pond, 25 January 1994; in Paractito, eight ponds, 27 January 
1994; in Chipiriri, three ponds, 29 January 1994; in Puerto San

<F P=106> [Article: "Law 1008 Mainly Affects `Little Fish'"; first </F>
paragraph is editorial introduction] 
  [Text] About 26 percent of the persons held in prison in 
Bolivia have been accused of narcotics trafficking. In San Pedro 
Prison about 40 percent of the minor prisoners there have been 
accused of consumption of or trafficking in drugs. 
  About 26 percent of the prison population in Bolivia were 
charged with narcotics trafficking and sent to prison under the 
provisions of Law 1008, according to data from the National 
Institute of Statistics [INE]. 
  The data points out that in Bolivia a total of 4,197 
prisoners were listed as being held up to the end of July 1993, 
of whom 3,653 were men and 544 were women. 
  The data show that the incidence of the crime of narcotics 
trafficking is higher among women than among men. 
<H5>  Women </H5>
  According to a research study conducted by the INE and the 
Ministry of the Interior, about 40 percent of the prison 
population has been accused of committing narcotics trafficking 
crimes, while the proportion of male prisoners so charged is 
lower: about 23 percent of male prisoners are being held for 
this reason. 
  Nevertheless, the information indicates that men are far 
ahead in committing this kind of crime. 
  Out of seven foreign nationals held in Bolivian prisons, one 
is a woman. 
<H5>  Small Fish </H5>
  Jerjes Justiniano, a member of the Chamber of Deputies and 
of 
the Committee on Human Rights, an organization attempting to 
amend Law 1008, has said: "Law 1008 has succeeded in sending to 
prison many persons accused of narcotics trafficking. In 
reality, these people are `small fish' or, as has been seen in 
the case of minor prisoners, are drug consumers. They need 
treatment instead of being sent to prison." 
  The Committee on Human Rights has evidence of arrests on the 
basis of Law 1008 in which legal procedures were not fully 
complied with and of prisoners who, during their detention in 
jail on charges of being narcotics traffickers, were tortured. 
<H5>  Minors Held for Narcotics Trafficking </H5>
  The problem of narcotics trafficking among minor prisoners 
held in La Paz affects a substantial percentage of them, 
although this is not the most important cause of imprisonment, 
according to information obtained at San Pedro Prison. 
  Out of a total of 128 minors under detention at that prison, 
about 40 percent are there for narcotics trafficking crimes. 
  Law 1008, criticized by some members of the National 
Congress 
for its harshness, has particularly affected minors held in 
prison who have no access to legal defense or any possibility of 
release on bail, because they have been accused of "narcotics 
trafficking." 
  In many cases the charge that they are "narcotics 
traffickers" has been made because of the company which they 
kept. However, as we showed in a report published last week, the 
most serious problem facing these young people in prison is that 
they live with an adult group of criminals, under crowded 
conditions, learning some of their vices and exposed to sexual 
abuse, violence, and labor exploitation, according to Adalid 
Viscarra, director of the care of youth in San Pedro Prison.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria by Maria </F>
Teresa Ronderos and Francisco Celis; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The president was beaming. "It is not a matter of 
good luck," he laughed. "When things are done right, they come 
out right." Gaviria believes that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
and the rest of the team that consolidated his election as the 
new OAS secretary general did things very well. Gaviria 
announced that he will not get involved in national politics in 
the next few years and added: "More than one person will be 
happy about that." 
  He appears confused when told what many people in the 
streets 
are saying, that he was put in the position by the United 
States. But he defends himself without hesitation and says 
firmly that he would not have been elected if the international 
community had not viewed Colombia as a very independent country. 
This is what he plans to do from his post at the OAS. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why did you want to head the OAS, an institution 
in crisis? 
  [Gaviria] Late last year, some presidents and foreign 
ministers suggested that I should submit my name for the 
position. It looked like an interesting challenge. Although 
Joao Baena did a good job at the OAS and the organization has 
modernized itself in the past few years, nearly all 
international organizations lag behind in terms of the 
tremendous changes that have taken place and the speed with 
which the agenda has shifted. For those reasons, I thought I 
could do something worthwhile after I complete my term. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Aren't you interested in resting? Isn't this 
decision like getting off one bucking bronco to get on another? 
  [Gaviria] Yes. I would say it is a coincidence--not a very 
happy one--that I will have to leave one position and assume 
another without respite. But the situation was not under my 
control. I have not set the date, but I will have to assume 
office as OAS secretary general a few weeks after the end of my 
administration, maybe early in September. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What will have to change to make the OAS a true 
instrument of integration and to overcome the rhetoric that has 
gone on for the last 30 years? 
  [Gaviria] First, I perceive a great desire on the continent 
for the OAS to play a more important role in economic issues and 
in the integration processes of various countries. There is an 
American ideal to create a great free trade zone. I hope to 
make some progress along those lines in the next few years. 
Second, there is a general idea that the OAS must be more 
prepared and equipped to cope with the problems of democracy on 
the continent, problems such as ruptures and difficulties. It 
must also encourage democracy. Third, we are convinced that much 
more has to be done regarding human rights, not only studying 
specific cases but stimulating compliance with these rights. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do these things depend on your leadership or on 
a 
change in the institution? 
  [Gaviria] I do not think it depends on my leadership. It 
truly depends on our capacity for political willingness and our 
ability to express it through institutional change, something 
that was not always possible in the world. Sometimes the 
willingness is there but no way is found to make changes or to 
use the means at our disposal, or maybe the adequate instruments 
are not found. I hope we will succeed. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Which case requires the most urgent attention: 
Cuba, Haiti, or Peru? Which is the most difficult? 
  [Gaviria] I think the Peruvian problem is a thing of the 
past following the Democratic Constituent Congress. I do not 
think Peru is a case at all anymore, nor do I think Cuba is on 
the organization's immediate agenda. Haiti, however, is on that 
agenda. Other than stating--as I have several times before--that 
we must continue to work to reestablish democracy in Haiti and 
to reinstall President Aristide, I have nothing new to add, 
except that I will have to study the situation carefully when I 
take office. There are still a few months to go yet, and I have 
no way of foreseeing what additional proposals or solutions 
could be adopted. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Among the most recent Colombian presidents, you 
have been one of the most open toward Cuba. You built bridges 
for them; you reestablished diplomatic relations; you met Fidel 
Castro; and now there is talk of selling oil to Cuba. Does this 
mean it will be easier for you to bring Cuba back into the 
Inter-American system? 
  [Gaviria] Nations all across the continent believe that if 
there is political and economic change in Cuba, approved, of 
course, by the organization, we could try to move Cuba back into 
the inter-American system. There is no way to assess the degree 
of such changes or the country's willingness to make them 
happen. If changes are made, it would be desirable to bring 
Cuba back into the system. 
  [EL TIEMPO] How will you maintain and guarantee your 
neutrality in conflicts involving Colombia? 
  [Gaviria] As soon as I take my oath, I will be the secretary 
general of the OAS. My opinion as the president of Colombia 
should have no bearing on my performance as secretary general. 
I will become the interpreter of the organization's mandates. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Trade, poverty, the environment, and drug 
trafficking are some issues on the continent's agenda. What are 
the priorities? 
  [Gaviria] I think the priorities are trade, the defense and 
conservation of democracy, human rights, the environment, and 
poverty. In the next few years we will have to work hard and 
see what happens. We need institutional reforms and new 
instruments. We must study everything carefully and see how to 
handle each specific situation. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Rumor has it that you were put in this position 
by the gringos. Niehaus said that after losing. How will you 
demonstrate your independence? 
  [Gaviria] I have no reason to demonstrate my independence. 
Colombia's foreign policy over the last few years should remove 
any doubt about the Colombian president's independence. 
Contrary to what one may expect to result from that policy, 
many countries backed Colombia because of its international 
policies and its independence. Colombia's success is due to the 
great work by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and the ministry 
itself in spreading our message. It was not Colombia's message 
but the message of the nations that accompanied Colombia. My 
candidacy was successful because of the way Colombia presented 
its arguments and convinced 20 countries to support it. The 
United States publicly expressed its support for Colombia early 
in the race and gave us its vote. I don't think it did anything 
more than that. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Will you remain on the sidelines of national 
politics over the next five years? 
  [Gaviria] Without any doubt whatsoever. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Is there anyone who is particularly happy 
because 
of this decision? 
  [Gaviria] More than one person will be happy about that. Of 
course, I am going to be on the sidelines of Colombian politics. 
There is no possibility whatsoever that I will be able to 
participate at any level. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Mr. President, with respect to the issue of drug 
trafficking, it is being said that Colombia has no autonomy and 
that it agrees with what the United States believes must be done 
with the drug cartels. 
  [Gaviria] I strongly disagree with that assessment. 
Colombia's policy on drug trafficking has been independent and 
in agreement with our convictions and the country's fundamental 
interests, and we have been able register a high degree of 
international cooperation. Keep in mind that during the past few 
years we outlined a uniquely Colombian policy. Colombia 
eliminated extradition, we undertook the surrender program, and 
we decided to strengthen the justice system. In the beginning, 
the international community viewed these policies with 
skepticism, and yet, these policies proved to be successful and 
effective. I would like to know where you got the idea that 
these policies were imposed by the Americans. None of these 
policies... 
  [EL TIEMPO] I was referring to recent statements and 
positions regarding the Cali Cartel, and comparing them with 
what the United States believes must be done. 
  [Gaviria] Statements from whom? 
  [EL TIEMPO] For example, the U.S. drug czar and the attorney 
general. 
  [Gaviria] We must understand that judicial cooperation is a 
very difficult process and that the two countries' judicial 
systems are different. We got into instituting some programs, 
and also into a somewhat disturbing public discussion in an 
effort to determine whether we could cooperate. It is logical 
that differences should arise. The U.S. Justice Department has 
significant differences with the Prosecutor General's Office. 
In the past, the executive branch also had differences of 
opinion, but I believe we are overcoming these now. 
Nevertheless, we cannot be surprised by this. The president is 
usually very careful when he issues an opinion with regard to 
U.S. drug trafficking policies. However, the Prosecutor 
General's Office does not always react in the same manner. If 
this happens here, then we must expect to receive criticism from 
over there. 
  [EL TIEMPO] In light of your experience in dealing with drug 
trafficking, what do you think the struggle against this problem 
will be like within the OAS? 
  [Gaviria] I believe that for now the OAS has a very narrow 
program which basically focuses on prevention and crop 
substitution. I also believe that no one has proposed going any 
further; at least, I do not see any worthwhile proposals being 
evaluated at this time. 
  [EL TIEMPO] How will Colombia benefit from your being in the 
OAS? 
  [Gaviria] I believe my election already represents something 
positive, because it represents a recognition of the country's 
international policies. I also believe it is going to be 
positive in the future. If Latin America progresses, the 
integration process develops, and cooperation increases, then 
Colombia will benefit just as all the other countries will 
benefit. 
  [EL TIEMPO] It has been said that you were born under a very 
auspicious star, and, under such a star, we are going to end up 
as world soccer champions. What do you think about the team? 
  [Gaviria] I do indeed believe I am often considered a very 
lucky person. Of course, that is a somewhat fatalistic 
explanation. No, it is not a matter of good luck. When things 
are done right, they come out right. Obviously, those things 
that started out on the wrong foot turned out badly. Public 
opinion and the media pointed out these mistakes. I believe it 
is time the country learns that things can go right and that it 
is not simply a matter of good luck. No. I believe we 
Colombians are doing things right in areas such as the economy, 
politics, institutional change, the struggle against drug 
trafficking, and sports. In fact, things cannot go wrong all of 
the time.

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Hernan Canal; from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Colombian drug authorities are very concerned 
because, apparently, Peru's successful struggle against the 
people who traffic in drugs in that country has resulted in a 
significant increase in coca growing in Colombia. Authorities 
have confirmed that Bolivian and Peruvian coca crops are being 
moved to Colombia and that the number of coca plantations has 
increased 100 percent in the past four years. This prompts a 
new and distressing situation in our country. 
  [Begin Colombian Drug Director Gabriel De Vega recording] We 
are becoming a country that produces coca and are very close to 
supplanting Bolivia for second place, after Peru, as a coca 
producing country. [end recording] 
  The situation is developing as a result of Peru's struggle 
against the aircraft that transport coca base from that country 
to Colombia to be processed into cocaine. The large number of 
planes downed by the Peruvians has caused pilots involved in 
drug trafficking to decide to leave the business or to charge 
too much. 
  [Begin De Vega recording] Confronted with this situation, 
for 
example, they prefer to shift coca growing to Colombia, even if 
it is not as productive as in Peru. They would rather increase 
the number of crops to compensate for the loss in productivity. 
[end recording] 
  This situation is making Colombia not only a cocaine 
processing and marketing country, but also a coca grower as big 
as Bolivia.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff today met with 
Medellin Cartel member John Jairo Velasquez, alias Popeye, in 
his office. The meeting was part of a process that includes 
negotiations on Popeye's sentence. Velasquez Vasquez was taken 
to the Prosecutor General's Office to enable him to take 
advantage of the surrender to justice program. 
  Popeye, Ottoniel de Jesus Gonzalez, alias Otto, and Roberto 
Escobar, alias El Osito, surrendered to authorities 18 months 
ago. Velasquez Vasquez met today with Prosecutor General Gustavo 
de Greiff, Deputy Prosecutor Francisco Sintura, and Ana Montes, 
the director of the Prosecutor's Office. This is the first time 
since his surrender that Popeye has agreed to negotiate with 
authorities. 
  The meeting lasted 90 minutes. The charges against him 
include drug trafficking, conspiracy, illegal enrichment, 
escaping from prison, and illegally possessing weapons. Amid 
tight security, Popeye was returned to Modelo Prison at around 
noon today. At the Prosecutor General's Office, Velasquez 
Vasquez expressed his wish to cooperate with justice and to 
confess to the crimes in which he has participated. 
  [Begin recording] [Sintura] He surrendered to justice and is 
working through the process. 
  [Reporter] Has he already confessed to some crimes?

<F P=106> [Article: "War Secrets"] </F>
  [Text] SEMANA reveals unknown details about the 
increasingly obvious two-month-long confrontation between the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the government. 
  At 0830 Saturday morning, Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales, a 
member of the Cauca Valley drug trafficking organization, 
appeared at the Palmira jail to turn himself in. The surrender 
came at a precise time when relations between the government and 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff had reached their most 
critical point. This was not only true because of the flexible, 
accommodating position which the government thinks De Greiff has 
taken on the surrender of the Cali cartel kingpins, but also 
because of explosive revelations made the preceding week at a 
Special Security Council meeting on the criminal activities of 
members of the Medellin Cartel being held at La Picota and La 
Modelo prisons in the capital whom the prosecutor general wanted 
to move to Itagui once again. 
  The situation has reached such a point that the prosecutor 
general has in recent days given serious consideration to the 
possibility of accusing Minister of Justice Andres Gonzalez of 
malfeasance before the Supreme Court. The government promptly 
considered the possibility of accusing De Greiff of 
"collaborating with drug trafficking," SEMANA was told by one 
well-placed source at Casa de Narino. Things were made even 
worse, observers say, by the legal and personal controversy 
involving the prosecutor general and top-ranking government 
officials which is doing serious damage to the image and 
credibility of the institution he represents. 
<H5>  Problem With Cali </H5>
  The wrangling between the prosecutor general and the 
government began even as talks began for the surrender of the 
Cali Cartel organization. De Greiff cast the first stone in the 
United States when speaking at a seminar in Baltimore. He stated 
that the war on drug trafficking had been lost and that 
consequently, the drug business should be legalized. By that 
time, the prosecutor general's talks with the attorneys for the 
Cali Cartel were already off the ground. 
  De Greiff also stated his intention of allowing house arrest 
for members of the cartel, to which the minister of justice 
immediately responded that house arrest was not part of the 
surrender policy. However, the straw that broke the camel's back 
was the meeting which De Greiff held with three recognized drug 
traffickers in the Valley: Helmer Herrera, better known as 
"Pacho Herrera," Jose Olmedo Ocampo, and Juan Carlos Ramirez, 
whom he certified based on Article 369E of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. 
  The confrontation became so obvious that no one is even 
trying to conceal it any longer. When rumors circulated in the 
past concerning such differences, the prosecutor general, 
ministers, attorney general, and president himself hastily 
denied them. When SEMANA divulged these differences for the 
first time a month and a half ago, the prosecutor general sent 
an indignant letter to this periodical and Gaviria told the 
daily newspaper EL TIEMPO that "there are no differences with De 
Greiff." This time, however, not only did the same personages 
not deny the dispute, but they made no effort whatsoever to hide 
it. 
<H5>  Itagui Problem </H5>
  The final break between the prosecutor general and the 
government started at a special Security Council meeting on 
Monday, the 7th, when, based on intelligence reports from DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security], DIJIN [Judicial and 
Investigative Police Directorate], and the National Penitentiary 
Institute (INPEC), an order from De Greiff to transfer Carlos 
Mario Alzate Urquijo, alias "Arete," Luis Carlos Aguilar 
Gallego, alias "El Mugre," Gustavo Adolfo Gutierrez Arrubla, 
alias "Maxwell," Jose Fernando Posada Fierro, and Jorge Pizano 
Santamaria from Bogota to Itagui was rescinded. The Council 
deemed that the transfer of the prisoners to Itagui was highly 
improper in terms of the policy of the surrender to justice 
inasmuch as allowing it meant opening the doors for the 
reunification of the so-called Medellin Cartel. 
  Once the government had decided not to allow the return of 
the five prisoners to Medellin, the prosecutor general went 
after the Security Council. "The inmates have neither the 
intention nor the means to revert to criminal activities," De 
Greiff said, adding that "I do not believe in those intelligence 
reports." The intelligence reports do in fact exist, however, 
saying precisely the opposite of what the prosecutor general 
thinks. 
  During a night inspection in November, INPEC and Police 
officials discovered a jacuzzi in the maximum security block of 
La Picota prison where "Arete" and "El Mugre" were caught at 
2300 by the officials performing the inspection and whom they 
tried to bribe. INPEC ordered another inspection a week later 
and found the prisoners partying. Bottles of liquor and 
marijuana papers were found in their cells. DIJIN and DAS had 
also detected a series of calls between La Picota inmates and 
their contacts in Medellin ordering them to continue their drug 
trafficking. 
  It was also learned that some 40 wardens had been forced to 
resign from INPEC because of threats against their lives. Every 
time they left the maximum security blocks in Bogota or 
Medellin, they encountered signs bearing their names saying "You 
are dead meat!" 
  As if this were not enough, La Modelo prison security 
intercepted a letter apparently addressed to "the Pepes" or the 
Cali Cartel people stating the following: "I want you to know 
that a guy is kidnapping people and dealing from here. He is 
doing it along with the guerrilla Francisco Galan and his 
fiancee. The guerrilla asked all of us to go with a bunch of 
people to kidnap her. The only one that called a halt to it was 
Otto and on 20 January, they kidnapped one Tomas Uribe. Jessica 
was the one who informed Galan in jail." 
<H5>  Permits </H5>
  At the two-hour-long Security Council meeting on Monday, not 
only were the intelligence reports analyzed, but a detailed 
study was made of authorizations issued to private parties by 
the prosecutor general to visit prisoners in the security blocks 
of La Picota and La Modelo prisons in Bogota. 
  The Security Council was struck by the many permits issued 
to 
Pablo Escobar's family to visit John Jairo Velasquez Vasquez, 
alias "Popeye," at La Modelo prison. Escobar's wife visited 
Popeye five days later. On that same day, she also received 
authorization to see "Arete" at La Picota. Two days later, the 
prosecutor general signed an authorization allowing Juan Pablo 
Escobar to enter La Modelo to meet with Popeye, and Escobar's 
son visited Arete that same day. On 3 February, the prosecutor 
general once again issued an authorization allowing Maria 
Victoria de Escobar to enter the maximum security block at La 
Picota prison to meet with Arete. 
  Another authorization that troubled the Security Council 
members was the one which the prosecutor general issued to 
Dagoberto Arturo Recio Chavez. On 14 January, the latter 
appeared at the La Picota administrative office with a permit 
from the prosecutor general allowing him to visit inmates Jose 
Fernando Posada Fierro and Jorge Pizano Santamaria in the 
maximum security section. A subsequent investigation by security 
organizations established that Recio Chavez is an investigator 
for the Prosecutor General's Office who gained admittance to La 
Picota in order to write a report on conditions in the block. It 
was also discovered that the official from the Prosecutor 
General's Office had been arrested on 14 February 1985 and 
charged with forgery. He became inmate number 205593 at La 
Modelo Prison. 
  Among the countless permits issued by the prosecutor general 
is one granted to a former beauty queen for regular visits to 
Roberto Escobar when he was a patient at the Military Hospital 
after the letter bomb incident. 
  Finally, the Security Council took up the matter of 
prosecutor Cruz Helena Aguilar's meeting with Carlos Mario 
Alzate Urquijo, Luis Carlos Aguilar, Gustavo Adolfo Gutierrez, 
and Jose Fernando Posada. It became evident that it was no mere 
legal proceeding, but a meeting between a representative of the 
Cali Cartel named Luis Guillermo Angel Restrepo and the Medellin 
people aimed at clearing up the death of Antioquia Governor 
Antonio Roldan Betancur. 
<H5>  What the Future Holds </H5>
  There are those who thought that Julio Fabio Urdinola's 
presentation on Saturday would be followed by a truce in the war 
between the government and the Prosecutor General's Office. 
However, early statements by the prosecutor general and the 
president made it quite clear that such would not be the case. 
De Greiff hastened to say he hoped that what had happened would 
end "the government's hysteria," while Gaviria said Urdinola's 
surrender was a very good thing to consolidate the policy of 
surrender, but that it would in no way fix things with the 
prosecutor general. 
  Whatever the case, the country can learn several lessons 
from 
what has happened. The first of these is that these things occur 
when legislation is drafted that gives rise to ambiguity, as was 
the case last year with the Code of Criminal Procedure, a matter 
on which both the Prosecutor General's Office and the government 
were in agreement. Ambiguous legislation gives rise to 
interpretations as contradictory as those now made by both the 
Executive Branch and the prosecutor general on standards to be 
applied in the case of the surrender of the Cali Cartel. 
  The second great lesson is that in a country that has 
suffered from drug trafficking for so many years, cooperation 
between government and legal authorities is not only desirable, 
but absolutely necessary, however much the prosecutor general 
may claim that the agency under his tutelage is autonomous and 
that Colombia has a separation of powers. Article 113 of the 
1991 Constitution states that "the different organs of 
government have separate functions, but will cooperate 
harmoniously to achieve their goals." If this must be so in any 
one field, it is in the fight against drug trafficking, where 
victories have been obtained only when the different organs of 
government have worked shoulder to shoulder. That is why, in 
addition to being indispensable, cooperation between the 
government and the Prosecutor General's Office is vital. Two 
entities detached from the government: the Police and DAS, must 
do the work of security and intelligence and the Prosecutor 
General's Office must use that information and make it 
judicially useful. 
  Through INPEC, which falls under the Ministry of Justice, 
the 
government must guarantee that those arrested and convicted must 
go to prison. Other agencies of government are involved in the 
process, however: the Armed Forces as a whole in the seizure of 
shipments; the FAC [Colombian Air Force] and Aerocivil with 
respect to planes used in trafficking; and the Superintendency 
of Banking and Exchange with respect to drug trafficking money 
laundering. 
  For all of these reasons, entrenchment such as that of 
Gustavo de Greiff with respect to the autonomy of the Prosecutor 
General's Office can be valid from the legal standpoint, but 
mistaken in practice. Something similar can be said about 
cooperation with the government of the United States. However 
much it may displease many nationalistic Colombians, Washington 
is Colombia's main partner in the fight against drugs and to 
break with that country can be as costly as doing so in the 
commercial or political fields. 
  Whatever the case, as confirmed by statements made following 
Urdinola's surrender, the confrontation has apparently reached 
the point of no return. It is too early to say which of the two 
camps is ahead in the public opinion polls. The Prosecutor 
General's Office has lost much of the prestige it enjoyed 
several months ago, as shown by recent polls. Even so, however, 
De Greiff continues to enjoy great credibility. If he does not 
want to lose it, he will have to demonstrate that the business 
he proposes with the people of Cali is not only good for that 
city, but right for society. The Prosecutor General's office 
will have to compile proof and reconstruct solid cases against 
those newly surrendering. If it does not do so, not only will 
the prosecutor general and his office lose respectability, but 
the greatest judicial reform of contemporary Colombia, 
establishment of the accusatory system, will be on the verge of 
collapse.

  [Text] Pereira--Last year's 519 murders and the discovery 
of mutilated cadavers in recent months reflect a level of 
violence unknown until recently in Risaralda's capital. And 
while the coffee crisis persists, investments are being made in 
large buildings and businesses. 
  The influx and expansion of drug cartels in the region have 
produced these disparate indicators. The sectional director of 
the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], Javier Restrepo 
Orrego, upon taking this position this week, emphasized that 
efforts need to be made to keep this phenomenon from continuing 
to disrupt the citizens' tranquility. 
  To date, 3,090 violations of Law 30 of 1986--possession, 
distribution, or sale of narcotics--have been recorded. This 
represents 41.44 [as published] of all crimes in this region 
during a 10-month period. 
  The 519 murders account for 63 percent of the homicides 
reported in 1993 by the Forensic Medicine Institute. Only 13 of 
the 827 autopsies listed the cause of death as "natural causes." 
  Criminologists say this could be seen coming. According to 
the National Police, in 1992 the city of Pereira had the highest 
crime rate in Colombia, with 211 crimes for each 10,000 
inhabitants, compared with the national average of 64 cases. 
  On the average, 750 crimes are reported per month in 
Risaralda. In suburban and rural areas, in one month the police 
found the dead bodies of seven men with no identification. The 
corpses had been mutilated and had multiple bullet wounds. In 
some cases, after they were identified it was determined that 
they had been killed as a result of criminal business deals. 
These investigations have been hampered by a lack of evidence. 
<H5>  The Drug Mafia: a Challenge </H5>
  In January 1994 there were 50 violent deaths reported, 10 
more than in the same month of 1993, according to the Forensic 
Medicine Institute. 
  Risaralda's governor, Roberto Galvez Montealegre, speaking 
of 
the breakdown of public order, said that his administration has 
been concerned and that even though things are under control, it 
is still possible that the situation may worsen with the 
presence of the drug traffic and insistent pressures from FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] gangs in the 
northwestern part of the department. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Libardo Diaz Ortiz, the police commander, 
was unwilling to provide partial statistics on crime in the last 
two months "in order to avoid disputes with other regional 
organizations." 
  In his first official statement as DAS director, Restrepo, 
who had served as deputy regional director, said his major 
challenge will be to take action against the drug Mafia 
operating in Risaralda and the northern part of Valle, for which 
he will have the agency's full support. 
  Last December the manager of the Civic Company of Pereira (a 
private organization), Felipe Lopez Hoyos, said the expansion of 
new businesses and the proliferation of restaurant and fast food 
franchises were being used to "launder hot money." 
  Moreover, in the controversy about doubling the real estate 
tax in Pereira, Mayor Ernesto Zuluaga Ramirez said the soaring 
growth in land and construction prices, caused by the presence 
of an irregular economy--attributable to drug trafficking 
investments--justified the highly unpopular rise in the property 
tax rate. 
  From an approximate value of 150 pesos per square meter in 
some parts of the city, the tax rate has risen to at least 750 
pesos. 
  Pereira Chamber of Commerce statistics say private 
investment 
rose 195 percent (almost quadrupling) in 1993 compared with 
1991, from slightly over 3.400 billion pesos to 9.479 billion 
pesos last year. 
  This seems strange, as the region's major economic activity, 
coffee, is experiencing its most severe earnings crisis, while 
textiles and the clothing industry are barely sustaining their 
traditional level.

  [Text] Alberto Urdinola Grajales, older brother of 
confessed drug traffickers Ivan and Julio Fabio Urdinola, was 
killed by gunshot early this morning in a Cali discotheque. No 
one has been arrested yet. 
  Early this morning at the Chaparrito Disco, located in 
southern Cali, Alberto Urdinola Grajales was killed. He was the 
older brother of Ivan and Julio, who have surrendered to justice 
based on Article 37 of the new Criminal Code. 
  Official sources reported a brawl had occurred at the crime 
site. Four young men made a flirtatious remark to a woman who 
was sitting with Urdinola. Urdinola bit the ear of one of the 
young men who in turn shot him. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The body was taken to 
Remedios Clinic after we went to the site and followed normal

  Meanwhile, the Prosecutor's Office has said Urdinola did not 
have a criminal record. The authorities said no one had been 
arrested for the crime.

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Brenes] </F>
  [Text] A group which utilized "mules" shipped at least 720 
kg of cocaine from Costa Rica to Europe over the last 36 months. 
The Drug Control Police arrested three of the group's leaders, 
a Costa Rican and two Colombians, on 18 March. 
  The group had a workshop to manufacture suitcases and 
backpacks with double bottoms. The workshop operated from the 
Invu [National Institute of Housing and City Planning] project 
in Las Canas, Alajuela Province. The mafiosi covered the drug 
packages with sulfur, to avoid detection by trained dogs, and 
then hid the the drugs in the double bottoms. 
  During the last three years they were able to send, via the 
"mules," about two 10-kilo shipments per week to different 
European countries. 
  The individuals who participated in the group's activities 
include at least eight of the 10 Costa Ricans arrested within 
the last 18 months in Spain when they tried to smuggle cocaine 
into the country. 
  During the operation, carried out on Friday, police arrested 
Carlos Alvarado Alvarado, a Costa Rican, and Moises Nader Vargas 
and Luis Carlos Diez Diez, Colombians. Diez has been identified 
as the group's leader, an emissary of the Pereira Cartel who was 
responsible for organizing the group's different connections. 
  Reports on the presence of Diez, who had ties with the 
Pereira Cartel, in Costa Rica led the narcotics police to a 
large-scale operation. At least 10 narcotics agents settled for 
almost a week next door to the Colombian mafioso's room at a 
local hotel in San Jose. 
  They tailed Diez, and this allowed them to locate Alvarado's 
house at the Invu Las Canas housing project, where they noticed 
a series of suspicious activities; on Friday they proceeded to 
raid the house. 
  The authorities seized 10 kg of cocaine stashed in a double 
bottom suitcase, as well as a considerable amount of implements 
to prepare the illegal merchandise for transportation--glue, 
foam, sewing machines, sulfur, thread, backpacks, and suitcases.

  [Text] San Jose, 24 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The Judicial 
Investigation Agency reports that Costa Rican police dealt two 
harsh blows to international drug trafficking in two separate 
operations this weekend. Initial investigations indicate that 
the drug operations were linked to one of Colombia's most 
violent cartels--the Pereira Cartel. 
  Police attribute the trafficking of 720 kg of cocaine from 
Colombia to Europe to one gang and report that another is 
responsible for illegally introducing 180 kg of heroin into the 
United States this year. 
  The authorities claim that with the capture of five 
Colombians, one Costa Rican, one Dominican, and one U.S. 
citizen, they have broken a connection to the Pereira Cartel--an 
organization that grew after the fall of Pablo Escobar and which 
police consider to be one of the most violent of its kind. 
  The cocaine traffickers--Colombian citizens Luis Diez Diez 
and Moises Nader Vargas and Costa Rican citizen Carlos 
Alvarado--were arrested on charges of possessing 10 kg of 
cocaine following months of investigation and 24-hour 
surveillance that began the day the entry register of foreigners 
into Costa Rica through Juan Santamaria Airport was scrutinized, 
eight days before their arrest. 
  Alvarado was under surveillance for two years under 
suspicion 
of being the Costa Rican contact for an international drug 
trafficking ring. 
  Elsewhere, 2.5 kg of heroin destined for the United States 
was seized in Costa Rica after evading Colombian, Panamanian, 
and Costa Rican customs agents when one of the "mules" 
(carriers) had a drug-filled packet rupture in his stomach. 
This was the lead that led narcotics agents to the other 
members of an international gang that was using Costa Rica as a 
transshipment bridge. 
  Juan Tribino, a Colombian citizen, was hospitalized in a 
state of shock Sunday night in Alajuela--a city 25 miles north 
of the capital--where it was determined he was suffering from a 
heroin overdose. Although in a coma, Tribaldo defecated five 
packets containing drugs, which prompted doctors to notify 
narcotics police. 
  The other members of the gang were identified as Fernando 
Ramirez and Claudia Cardoze, both from Colombia; Geovanny Ferrer 
of the Dominican Republic; and U.S. citizen Felix Lopez. 
  Tribino remains in critical condition in Alajuela hospital, 
while the rest of the drug traffickers are under arrest and 
charged with international drug trafficking. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman said drug 
traffickers recruit young men in his country to transport the 
drug to different parts of Europe. He added that 16 Costa 
Ricans currently imprisoned in Europe could be contacts for this 
gang. Ten of them are in Spain, three in the Netherlands, and 
the rest are either serving terms or waiting to be sentenced in 
Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy. None of them had previous 
criminal records. 
  Although unconfirmed by authorities, judicial sources have 
confirmed to ACAN-EFE that the interrogations and investigations 
show the Pereira Cartel is very active in Costa Rica and has a 
number of connections. According to these sources each 
connection only has only enough information to work within a 
specific organization. In case they are arrested, they cannot 
be linked to other drug traffickers or the rest of the network.

  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila, 28 March -- Federal Judicial 
Police [PJF] personnel today seized more than four tons of 
cocaine and arrested two alleged drug traffickers who were 
transporting the drug in a tanker truck on the road from this 
city to Concepcion del Oro, Zacatecas. 
  PJF Commander Juan Carlos Alvarado reported Raul Juarez de 
la 
Paz and Miguel Angel Salazar Ramirez, both from Uruapan, 
Michoacan, had been arrested during the police action. Both men 
testified that they received the merchandise in Guadalajara, 
Jalisco and were taking it to Cadereyta, Nuevo Leon. 
  The policemen initially stopped the truck for speeding on 
the 
road to Concepcion del Oro in Zacatecas and discovered the large 
cocaine shipment while checking the vehicle. The 4,187 kg of 
cocaine had been placed in 2,162 packages in the vehicle's tank. 
  The PJF commander said the drug shipment and the two men 
were 
placed in the custody of the Federal Attorney General's Office 
in Saltillo, Coahuila.

  [Excerpt] Pachuca, Hidalgo, 3 March--The attorney general 
of the republic, Diego Valades Rios, cautioned here that any 
member of the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] involved in selling 
drugs, or associated with that crime, will be severely punished 
to the full extent of the law. 
  He claimed that this was proven by the arrest, early this 
morning, of Manuel Zamudio Gonzalez, a member of the force, in 
the settlement of Tizayuca. He was carrying 700 kg of marijuana 
on a pickup truck, intending to sell it in the northern part of 
the country. The attorney general noted: "We shall be very 
watchful to ensure that the maximum penalty is imposed on him." 
  He made the preceding statement at a press conference, after 
a work meeting with Governor Jesus Murillo Karam, at the 
Government Palace. There they agreed to undertake joint security 
action in the state, doing whatever is necessary to combat crime 
permanently. 
  In this regard, the attorney general announced that a group 
of workers from the department headed by him would publish, 
within a week, the plan to be implemented in order to achieve 
results and provide greater tranquillity to Hidalgo residents. 
  However, he emphasized that Hidalgo is among the states with 
the lowest crime rates in the entire country; adding that, even 
in the case of drug smuggling, it has one of the lowest 
incidences. [passage omitted]

administratively guilty of collusion: the second-named, with the 
Arellano Felix brothers' cartel, and the other three, with the 
cartel of Joaquin Guzman Loera ("El Chapo") Guzman. 
  The department added that Garcia Davila is subject to a 
criminal suit brought against him in Guadalajara, for the crimes 
of clandestine smuggling of firearms, arms collection, improper 
exercise of public service, and bribery. The decision regarding 
his sentence is still being awaited. 
  As for Zarate Rodriguez, Cesar Perez, and Peralta Perez, 
they 
are being held in the Cereso [Social Rehabilitation Center] in 
Guadalajara, Jalisco, subject to criminal proceedings in the 
same city for the offenses of criminal association and bribery. 
The latter are in the forms of processing, packing, 
transporting, selling, purchasing, and trafficking in cocaine, 
as well as obstructing the administration of justice. Added to 
the case against Zarate Rodriguez is the crime of influence 
peddling. These penalties were ordered based on the Federal Law 
on Responsibilities of Public Servants. When the administrative 
liability of the aforementioned subjects was investigated and 
fully proven, the PGR imposed the disqualification on them, 
barring them from holding any public service position, 
employment, or commission in the country for 20 years. This is 
the most severe administrative penalty stipulated in the 
aforementioned legislation.

<F P=106> [Interview by Miguel Cabildo with Almoloya Prison director </F>
Juan Pablo de Tavira; place and date not given: "Narco Threats 
To Eliminate High Security Prisons"] 
  [Excerpts] The lack of continuity in prison programs, and 
the absence of a career civil service in the prison system, as 
well as the discreditation campaign sponsored by presumed human 
rights defenders' groups instigated by drug traffickers, are 
threatening to corrupt the Federal Maximum Security Centers. 
This assertion was made by Pablo de Tavira, their director. 
  There are currently two prisons of this type: the Number One 
Federal High Security Center in Almoloya, Mexico State, with 383 
inmates (it has a capacity of 400), and the Number Two, in 
Guadalajara, Jalisco, with a population of 220 inmates. 
  A few days ago, De Tavira held a press conference, something 
unusual, because during his three plus years as director of the 
Almoloya center, he has always refused to speak with reporters. 
At that conference, he charged that there were human rights 
organizations sponsored by drug traffickers in existence, and he 
claimed to have received threats. 
  In an interview with PROCESO, he expanded upon his 
statements: 
  [Cabildo] Are you worried about the threats that you have 
received? 
  [De Tavira] The inmate here can threaten very easily. And he 
does so because it has always worked for him. "This chief is 
living on borrowed time," claims Rafael Caro Quintero, referring 
to me. 
  [Cabildo] Did he do this personally? 
  [De Tavira] There is no direct dealing with him; he tells 
this to others. But he shouts it in front of many people, to let 
me know: "This chief is living on borrowed time. He is a living 
dead man, because there are 500 people ready to kill him at any 
time." 
  [Cabildo] How much do those threats worry you? 
  [De Tavira] When stated by someone who has made criminal 
activity his life, they do worry me. But I think that I must be 
strong and face the risks. We must take care of ourselves, 
certainly, but we must be firm in our convictions. I believe 
that high security prisons are necessary, that these people 
deserve a change, and that society deserves respect. And society 
will be respected when those drug lords are really punished, as 
they deserve. We cannot let ourselves be overcome by fear, 
either, just because they could kill us. 
  [Cabildo] What is happening at Almoloya? 
  [De Tavira] The problem is concentrated among 20 percent of 
the population, consisting of the principal drug trafficking 
"capos" and their aides. They are trying, at all costs, to 
return to the traditional prison systems, and to establish 
self-government. The leading "capos" (Rafael Caro Quintero, 
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, Javier Pardo Cardona, Oliverio 
Chavez Araujo, Fonseca Carrillo, "El Chapo" Guzman, and one of 
the Arellano Felix group) constitute only 2 percent. The other 
18 percent are highly dangerous people. They are the executors, 
such as "Ceja Guera," or persons in some way connected with 
public administration who have later appeared implicated in 
illicit activities, as in the case of Gonzalez Trevino. They are 
people not so powerful as the "capos," but just as important for 
national security reasons. 
  [Cabildo] Why have the maximum security prisons been 
created? 
  [De Tavira] It all started with the problems experienced in 
Mexican prisons during 1985, which also coincided with Mexico's 
major drug trafficking problems. Very serious things began 
happening: The prison riots, such as those in Nayarit, 
Matamoros, Hermosillo, and Puebla, were bloody. For example, 
there was a monarchy in Matamoros, headed by Chavez Araujo; in 
the Northern Prison, by Caro Quintero; or in the Southern 
Prison, by Felix Gallardo. They were living like kings, and this 
exposed a sad reality: the prisons were in the inmates' hands, 
in many instances owing to self-government. 
  With Sergio Garcia Ramirez, Alfonso Quiroz Cuaron, and 
Antonio Sanchez Galindo, who modernized the prison system with a 
great scientific emphasis, the Porfirian-style jails 
disappeared. This occurred during the 1970's. In the 1980's, 
however, Mexico's real prison situation deteriorated enormously. 
Crime became organized and highly dangerous, associated with the 
international drug traffic. And all this necessarily had 
repercussions on the prisons, which were neglected with respect 
to their capacity, because no more prisons were built. 
  Another deciding factor in the deterioration was the 
benevolent attitude of the authorities, who thought that by 
granting concessions to the inmates they were keeping peace in 
the prisons. But this only contributed to self-government, and 
to giving the inmates a privileged status. And, according to 
many penologists, this is all right, because it keeps peace in 
the prisons. 
  However, when power struggles began, with massacres among 
inmates, and we realized that there were all types of weapons in 
the prisons and that the vested interests were terrible, the 
creation of maximum security centers emerged as a priority 
requirement. 
  [Cabildo] Who was the brains behind this type of prison? 
  [De Tavira] It was not my invention; it was a necessity. To 
build high security centers in Mexico, a lengthy investigation 
was conducted, with many specialists participating. Later, the 
plan emerged creating the so-called Federal Closed Incarceration 
Center, and the first institution was the Almoloya center. It is 
located on the very same site where humanistic prison reform, 
very praiseworthy in its time, had appeared. 
  [Cabildo] However, there are apparently problems at 
Almoloya, 
too. 
  [De Tavira] What is happening at Almoloya, after three years 
and three months of work, is a natural reaction from those who 
had everything, and now are not allowed anything that could 
foster self-government. At Almoloya, the inmate must submit to a 
prison system diametrically opposed to the traditional one, and 
to a program of work that he must do every day, without excuses. 
The inmate may not remain in his cell; he must leave in the 
morning and return when he has finished his tasks. There is a 
very strict classification. Equals are kept with equals, so as 
to undermine them, to some extent. A thorough preliminary 
analysis is made of each inmate, including his record and 
connections with gangs, so as to assign him properly. Except for 
two suicides, there has not been a single problem. 
  I realize that the Almoloya system may not be an easy one 
for 
the inmate, and it is not easy, because it is disciplinary. It 
is an institution that is punishing his social conduct. 
  What is happening now is that the inmates who, at the 
outset, 
arrived rather impressed, have gradually become adapted. 
However, since the changes that they were expecting have not 
occurred, they are very angry with the Almoloya system, and are 
trying to damage it in some way. 
  How will they damage it? Well, by discrediting it through 
certain nongovernmental organizations that have no 
representative status; or through their lawyers, who will do 
what they say, because they are paid, and paid very well. The 
drug traffickers' attorneys live like kings. Everyone is 
entitled to a defense, but the drug trafficker's lawyer is 
capable of anything. They are unscrupulous people, and it is 
they who are organizing the discreditation campaign. 
  [Cabildo] Can you specify which nongovernmental human rights 
organizations are the ones participating in that campaign? 
  [De Tavira] Initially, the financing comes from the upper 
echelon, with financial power. I am referring in particular to 
organizations comprised of ex-inmates, who become business 
agents for the prisoners in some way. They receive very good 
rewards through the lawyers, to exert some pressure on the 
authorities. 
  [Cabildo] Could you cite exactly which organizations they 
are? 
  [De Tavira] There is a single organization, the 
Inter-American Human Rights Committee in Defense of Prison 
Inmates (CIDH-DIP). There are others, for example, the Rebels; 
and still another, named for a youth whom they took out and 
tortured at the Northern Prison. There has been a proliferation 
of human rights organizations comprised of inmates or 
ex-inmates. In this particular case, those who sign the ads and 
appear at the press conferences are ex-inmates who were at other 
centers, and have never been in Almoloya, not even to visit. 
They are absolutely ignorant of the system operating at Almoloya. 
  We have very strict control over visits, and none of those 
signing have been at Almoloya. Only family members of the 
inmates and their lawyers have access to the prison. So, who 
could possibly be conveying all these inmates' concerns outside? 
Well, it is the lawyers. They are the ones calling upon these 
associations and planning the campaigns through the drug 
traffickers' wives, who are heading the discreditation campaign. 
  For example, there is Caro Quintero's wife, Mrs. Elenis de 
Caro; Felix Gallardo's daughters; Marcio Alvarez's daughters and 
wife; the wife of the Colombian, Pardo Cardona; and Don Neto's 
wife and daughters. They have been the ones leading the 
campaign, at press conferences organized at a luxury hotel, the 
Camino Real. 
  They were later held at the office of one of the attorneys 
representing Caro Quintero, Felix, and Don Neto: namely, Efrain 
Garcia Ramirez. It is an honorable surname but, fortunately not 
related to Don Sergio Garcia Ramirez. I am not saying that Mr. 
Efrain Garcia Ramirez is not a trained man; he is. He was even 
my student, and an outstanding student. But I think that, in the 
legal profession, each individual is dedicated to, and defends 
whomever he wishes. He has decided to defend those people; I 
would not do so. 
  Efrain's idea is that those only being indicted, that is, 
those who have not yet received their respective sentences, do 
not belong in Almoloya. However, the amendments to the Federal 
Code of Criminal Procedure and to the Regulations of Federal 
Centers leave his demands invalid. With those amendments, the 
legality of the permission to confine persons still under 
indictment in Almoloya has been settled. [passage omitted] 
  The prison personnel are in charge of everything and, in 
return, high security is maintained. There is an attempt to 
prevent self-government, and to avoid all the problems that have 
caused serious trouble in our institutions. That is why the 
state spends so much money: 200 new pesos per day on each inmate. 
  Now, they are trying to sabotage this system. But there can 
be no setback in the construction of maximum security prisons 
(it is about to begin on the one in Tamaulipas), if there is a 
desire to put an end to the self-government operating in the 
majority of the country's jails.

  [Text] The Supreme Court of Justice, in a plenary session, 
has studied the case of drug trafficker (Jacobo Lerner 
Zimmerman) in detail. Chief Magistrate Arturo Hoyos believes 
that keeping him in jail is the right decision. 
  [Begin Hoyos recording] The habeas corpus we reviewed refers 
to crimes (Mr. Lerner Zimmerman) is accused of committing in the 
Republic of Panama. Regarding said accusations, the Supreme 
Court finds that there is sufficient evidence to hold this 
person in connection with these drug related crimes against the 
public. [end recording] 
  It is noteworthy that (Jacobo Lerner Zimmerman), a Colombian 
citizen involved in drug trafficking activities, is wanted by 
the United States for the same crime. The Supreme Court, 
however, has already denied an extradition request. 
  [Begin Hoyos recording] There is a ruling by the Criminal 
Court that denies the extradition request, and that ruling must 
be executed. [end recording] 
  In view of this Supreme Court decision, (Jacobo Lerner 
Zimmerman) will have to spend a long time in jail unless he 
escapes, which is not uncommon in the country's jails among 
people connected with drug trafficking.

  [Text] Alleged Colombian guerrillas who are guarding poppy 
and coca plantations in the jungle areas along the border 
between Panama and Colombia have threatened the members of the 
National Air Service (SAN) with future attacks on their 
aircraft, according to reports issued yesterday. 
  A police source who declined to be identified has revealed 
the alleged guerrillas informed SAN personnel "if they continue 
to overfly those areas where they had their narcotics 
plantations, they would execute artillery attacks against their 
aircraft." 
  The insurgents threatened to down every helicopter that 
overflew the region and gave a 48-hour deadline to cease those 
incursions. "The Colombian Army in the area where crops are 
located is warned, and so their lives would be endangered." 
  During the past weeks, several SAN airplanes carrying 
filming 
equipment and Panamanian policemen have overflown the 
inhospitable jungle of Darien Province, where they have detected 
coca and poppy plantations extending over an immense number of 
hectares. 
  Once the report about the alleged guerrillas was confirmed, 
Panamanian policemen made a new incursion with the aid of the 
U.S. Army, the result of which is unknown. 
  It seems in the next few hours the air operations will be 
intensified in those regions to reach the sites where the rebel 
groups and drug traffickers are guarding the plantations. 
  Until now and unofficially speaking, it is believed the 
guerrillas belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC), which protects the drug traffickers' million-dollar 
plantations for hefty sums of money. 
  A report indicated that after announcing their intentions 
the 
FARC rebels may stage an attack against Panamanian aircraft, 
because the report stated the rebels are protected with 
sophisticated weapons of war. 
  In February 1993 a contingent of Panamanian policemen, with 
the backing of the U.S. Army and DEA officials, destroyed coca 
and marijuana plantations on 90 hectares located in the remote 
Darien Jungle on the border with Colombia. 
  The operation, called "Frontera Libre," was conducted to 
rescue three U.S. "New Tribe" missionaries whom the rebels had 
kidnapped. Several drug traffickers and undocumented aliens were 
arrested during that operation. 
  According to preliminary reports by the Panamanian police, 
the new poppy and coca plantations are scattered in strategic 
jungle areas between Darien and Colombia, making access to them 
difficult. 
  Opium is the plant from which heroin is extracted. It is one 
of the world's deadliest drugs and to date has killed thousands 
of people in the different countries where it is consumed.

  [Text] Narcotics Division Chief Ramiro Yarvis of the 
Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) has said "clandestine ports" all 
across the country are being used by drug traffickers to smuggle 
drugs. 
  Yarvis indicated that Darien Province, currently the site of 
an operation to destroy coca plantations, is just one of the 
areas in which drug traffickers harvest the drug. He added that 
Colombian guerrillas protect the coca plantations in Darien, 
where hostile and remote terrain makes entering the jungle 
difficult. He admitted that other drug laboratories in Darien 
may not have been destroyed. Yarvis said the technical and 
personnel resources available to state security agencies, the 
PTJ, National Air Service, and the National Maritime Service are 
virtually incapable of combating this problem. 
  "There is a huge number of clandestine ports being used to 
smuggle drugs," he noted. 
  Former National Customs Director Rodrigo Arosemena told 
reporters that a bill to authorize the destruction of drugs 24 
hours after they are seized is necessary to stop drug 
traffickers who are flooding the country with drugs.

  [Text] The Panamanian Public Force, with the aid of the 
U.S. military and in coordination with Colombian authorities, 
has destroyed at least 10 coca fields in Darien Province and 
detained an undisclosed number of people. 
  Operation Tornado, directed by Major Santiago Fundora of the 
National Air Service (SAN), was confirmed to LA PRENSA by 
President Guillermo Endara himself, who thanked the newspaper 
for not reporting on the operation before its completion, even 
though the newspaper had received all of the information well 
ahead of time. 
  Operation Tornado was launched Saturday morning when three 
teams--one from the SAN, one from the National Police, and one 
from the Institutional Protection Service (SPI)--flew to Darien 
aboard several SAN helicopters to destroy the coca fields, whose 
acreage was not disclosed. The groups also destroyed 
coca-processing labs in the region along the border with 
Colombia. 
  Fundora reported to Endara on 27 March that the operation 
had 
been "a complete success," because at least 10 coca fields had 
been destroyed. Endara said the Panamanian authorities also set 
fire to several huts presumed to be small coca-processing labs. 
He also confirmed that several people were caught and handed 
over to the proper authorities. 
  One source who asked to remain anonymous said Operation 
Tornado was carried out quickly and without any clashes. Those 
arrested were taken by surprise in the afternoon and evening 
last Saturday. The operation was nearly complete yesterday, 
Sunday morning, although several coca fields, allegedly planted 
by Colombians, had yet to be destroyed. 
  The source said Panamanian and Colombian authorities took 
part in the operation, along with the U.S. Government's 
logistical support through the U.S. Embassy in Panama. The 
source also told LA PRENSA that the authorities are looking for 
a hacienda worth several millions of dollars and located 
somewhere in the Darien jungle. 
  Endara said: "I have been told that the operation was a 
complete success. The second stage consists of burning other 
fields that were found." 
  Members of the special teams that participated in Operation 
Tornado are still in Darien. They are expected to begin to 
return to Panama City today provided no trouble arises with 
guerrillas in the Palle area who have threatened to shoot down 
Public Force planes and helicopters. Endara did not reveal the 
size or exact location of the coca fields destroyed or the 
number of police who took part in the operation. An official 
report is expected to be released today, however. 
  Panamanian and Colombian security forces have been carrying 
a 
coordinated work against drug trafficking and to heighten border 
security to prevent a number of crimes perpetrated in and around 
the jungle. This type of work started to be carried out in the 
framework of good-neighbor commissions that Presidents Endara 
and Cesar Gaviria installed last year. As part of the effort, a 
number of Pamamanian agents have received police training in 
Colombia. 
  In addition to fighting drug trafficking, the two countries 
have been implementing a process of rapprochement and 
cooperation on energy, trade, culture, and agriculture and 
livestock, according to official reports of the two governments.

  [Text] Lima, 29 Mar (EFE) -- General Nicolas Hermoza, chief 
of the High Command of the Peruvian Armed Forces, today reported 
that the price of cocaine base has fallen abruptly following 
recent security service actions against the trafficking gangs. 
  Hermoza stated that the price of washed cocaine base has 
fallen during the past few weeks from $1,500 to $150 per kilo. 
He presented 23 traffickers to the media who were captured in 
the jungle department of Madre de Dios while dispatching 1,051 
kg of cocaine to Colombia. 
  Hermoza also showed assets seized from the traffickers, 
including electricity generators, precursors to manufacture 
cocaine base, communications equipment, and vehicles. 
  The traffickers were captured during several operations last 
week in the province of Inapari, Madre de Dios department, on 
the border with Brazil, where a drug collection center operated. 
  Hermoza indicated that the cocaine paste, which was to have 
been processed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombia, had 
arrived from the Huallaga valleys and from the Ucayali River 
area. 
  The military commander said: "The capture of these 
traffickers and their equipment is proof that land and air 
actions in the Huallaga and Ucayali areas has caused the 
trafficking axis to be moved from there to Madre de Dios 
department." 
  Security forces seized 3,653 kg of basic paste and captured 
13 traffickers on 24 February in Boca Manu, also in Madre de 
Dios department, in the largest drug seizure ever in this Andean 
country. 
  Peru produces some 2,000 tons of basic paste per annum that 
is exported mainly to Colombia, where the Cali and Medellin 
"cartels" process it into the pure cocaine that is sold in the 
United States and Europe. 
  Two thirds of all cocaine consumed in the world is processed 
from the basic paste that comes from Peru.

  [Text] Congressman Manuel Moreyra Loredo (Sode) 
[Solidarity and Democracy] has asked Andres Reggiardo Sayan 
(NM-C90) (New Majority-Change 90), the CCD (Democratic 
Constituent Congress) Defense and Domestic Order Committee 
chairman, to summon EP (Peruvian Army) General Nicolas Hermoza 
Rios, the Armed Forces Joint Command chairman. 
  The goal of summoning Hermoza is to have him explain the 
charges filed by EP Major Evaristo Castillo Aste (Ret) and EP 
Captain Ricardo Falconi Alvarez (Ret) on alleged support 
supplied by bad military elements to notorious drug traffickers 
and their ties. 
  Moreyra's petition makes us recall what happened a few 
months 
ago when, summoned by the CCD Human Rights Committee chaired at 
that time by Roger Caceres (FNTC) (Workers and Peasants National 
Front), Hermoza Rios flatly denied that any Army members had 
anything to do with the disappearance of nine students and a 
professor from La Cantuta University and claimed that those who 
disputed his denial were conducting a campaign against our 
country's guardian institution. The following day the tanks 
were out on the streets. 
  Maybe recalling this event, Moreyra makes it clear that his 
proposal is based "solely and exclusively on the fact that the 
bad elements who are wearing uniforms our country has given them 
and are openly--and with impunity--acting against national 
interests, degrading their institution, must be thoroughly 
investigated and exemplarily punished to safeguard the image, 
credibility, and respect of our Armed Forces."

<F P=106> [Article from the "Farewell to the Arms" column by Carlos </F>
Tapia: "The Armed Forces and Drug Trafficking''] 
  [Text] According to drug experts, 600 metric tons of 
cocaine base currently are manufactured in Peru. Less than 5 
percent of this huge amount was seized and destroyed in 1993, 
despite the Armed Forces joining the fight to eradicate this 
scourge. 
  Powerful international market forces have consolidated a 
demand that pressures--in the face of the lack of real and 
competitive alternatives, besides many other factors--humble 
coca-producing peasants who have gradually become cocaine base 
producers. 
  Given the business' illegal characteristic, the "firms" and 
organized gangs that stock cocaine base and transport it either 
domestically or abroad are the ones that obtain the greatest 
percentage of the "added value." This is so because the risk of 
transporting this particular kind of merchandise to Colombian 
laboratories where it is transformed into cocaine hydrochloride 
is very big. 
  This business requires armed groups for protection and for 
administering an efficient and modern corruption network at all 
levels. The latter is much more important than the former to 
ensure the business' success. That is why new "clandestine" 
airports are opened as soon as others are closed down. 
  The solution to this problem has social aspects and 
presupposes very large financial investments. It also requires 
efficient and intelligent police repression. But no matter where 
you look at it from, there is no justification for military 
intervention in drug enforcement. 
  If the power of drug trafficking to finance terrorism has 
been clearly established, it is senseless to allow--now under 
the current situation of subversion--the Armed Forces to assume 
the main responsibility for fighting this scourge in the drug 
trafficking zones. 
  The risks are very high and the consequences very serious. 
Once I heard a high-ranking Army officer assigned to the 
Huallaga Front say: "... my officers go out with very high 
morale; they are willing to confront the subversives and fight 
under the most difficult conditions, but I am not sure they can 
resist an envelope with $10,000." 
  The case is that if a battalion officer engages in criminal 
actions, he is interested in involving other soldiers to ensure 
their silence and avoid sanctions. A wrongly understood 
comradeship could end in complicity. 
  Those who do not accept such complicity can be the object of 
arbitrary sanctions or persecution by other officers involved in 
drug trafficking. There are also many other honest officers who 
do not accept involvement but prefer to remain silent in order 
to avoid problems. 
  The case of "Vaticano" has negatively affected the Armed 
Forces' image, especially the Army. Why must the Armed Forces 
continue doing a job that strictly pertains to the police? Would 
it not be better to look for another Ketin Vidal [police officer 
who arrested Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman] to fight drug 
trafficking?

  [Text] Pursuing the guidelines of the government 
antinarcotics policy in 1992 and 1993, the Armed Forces and the 
National Police [PNP] seized 17 tonnes of drugs, worth over $100 
million. 
  In drug enforcement operations during the first two months 
of 
this year alone, 4,369 kg of drugs, including cocaine paste and 
cocaine hydrochloride, have been seized. 
  The Armed Forces had sole responsibility for the struggle 
against terrorism until 1991, while the PNP were responsible for 
drug enforcement. 
  This situation changed in 1992 when President Alberto 
Fujimori's administration stated that the Armed Forces and the 
PNP, under a single command, would handle the planning, 
implementation, and supervision of drug enforcement to increase 
efficiency. 
  According to a report by the Interior Ministry and the Joint 
Command, 8,000 kg of narcotics, including 595 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride and 7,471 kg of cocaine paste, were seized in 
1992. Additionally, 185,895 kg of chemicals used to process 
drugs were destroyed. 
  Joint military-police operations in 1993 were crushing: 
8,432 
kg of cocaine paste and 441 kg of cocaine hydrochloride--as well 
as 90 metric tons of chemicals, including sulfuric acid and 
sodium carbonate--were seized. 
  The success of the antinarcotic strategy during the first 
two 
months of this year is undeniable because 3,733 kg of cocaine 
paste, 6 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 31 metric tons of 
chemicals have been seized. Some 99 percent of this was seized 
in a single operation two weeks ago in the Boca Manu-Madre de 
Dios area. 
  The National Customs Superintendency Antinarcotics Brigade 
represents another significant pillar of drug enforcement in 
Peru, seizing 822 kg of narcotics between 1990 and 1993. In 
1993, this special unit seized 293 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, 
24 kg of cocaine paste, and 400 kg of chemicals. 
  It must also be mentioned that cocaine hydrochloride is 
worth 
$75,000 per kg and cocaine paste is worth $1,500 per kg on the 
international market. 
  The drugs seized in 1992-93 by the Armed Forces and the 
PNP--16,000.879 kg--is worth about $100 million. 
  The PNP Antinarcotics Directorate reported that 3,180 
operations were carried out and 4,195 traffickers were captured 
in 1992. In 1993, 5,000 traffickers were arrested during 3,640 
operations. 
  The Air Force intercepted 34 small planes used by 
trafficking 
rings to carry drugs in 1992. In 1993, another 29 small planes 
and 28 airstrips were seized. 
  Within the context of drug enforcement in Peru, 67 metric 
tons of drugs have been burned during the past 13 years by the 
Interior Ministry Executive Agency for Drug Control (OFECOD). 
  Of this, 12,000.054 kg of narcotics, including 11,191 kg of 
cocaine paste, 537.400 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 325.850 
kg of marijuana, were burned in 1993. This is the largest 
quantity of drugs burned recently. 
  Additionally, 60,310 kg of cocaine paste, 2,554 kg of 
cocaine 
hydrochloride, 4,696 kg of marijuana, 26 kg of opium, and 7 kg 
of poppy, among other drugs, were burned between 1981 and 1993. 
The smallest quantity of drugs, involving barely 1,441 kg, were 
burned in 1987. Of this, 1,125 kg was cocaine paste, 5 kg 
cocaine hydrochloride, and 311 kg marijuana.

  [Excerpts] A high-ranking official of the Antidrug Division 
(Dinandro) has said that the arrest of Margarita Cachique Rivera 
will inevitably lead to the dismantling of the drug trafficking 
gang led by her brother Abelardo, aka "Teniente" or "Negro." 
Dinandro intelligence agents caught the woman, who was at 
large, as she was leaving one of her properties in Chorrillos. 
  The "firm" of the Cachique Rivera brothers, which also 
includes brothers Segundo, aka "Capitan" or "Guno"; Adolfo, aka 
"Alferez"; Nicolas, aka "Mayor"; and their father Gaudencio 
Cachique Sajami, is considered the Cali cartel's main cocaine 
hydrochloride supplier. 
  According to estimates by the Directorate, the gang sends to 
Colombia 1,000 kg of cocaine and 20 tons of cocaine base per 
month. 
  Margarita Cachique Rivera, her father, and her brothers are 
wanted by the Seventh Court and by the 30th Lima Court on drug 
trafficking charges. 
  Born on 7 May 1964 in Rupa Rupa district, Leoncio Prado 
Province, Huanuco, Margarita's job was to contact with 
international drug traffickers' organizations in Lima, perform 
financial operations, and buy the chemicals for the production 
of cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride. 
  She was captured last Sunday, in the evening, in the 
vicinity 
of Alameda Premio Real Avenue, in block J, lot 16, of the La 
Encantada neighborhood in Chorrillos. She was carrying neither 
arms nor drugs, and did not resist arrest. 
  The source said: "We are aware of the Cachique Riveras' 
movements," adding that "the arrest of Margarita will give us 
positive clues for finding her brothers. Beyond all doubt, it 
is a very important arrest." 
  The Cachique Riveras, who are led by "Abelardo" or 
"Teniente," is an organization that, according to some 
specialists, is the third most important "firm" after those of 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano"--whose firm is now 
led by his brother Elias, aka "Quichin" or "Sony"--and the 
Colombian Walter Simeon Vargas Arias, aka "El Ministro." 
[passage omitted] 
  According to Dinandro, "Teniente" was spotted last February 
in Boca del Manu, Madre de Dios. 
  He is believed to have travelled to that area to personally 
collect money, obtained through drug sales, from the Colombian 
"Pablito," who has operated in this department since October 
1993. 
  Antinarcotics agents have learned that "Pablito" refused to 
honor his debt, thus giving rise to a shootout between the 
henchmen of both mafia members. The Colombian, however, finally 
decided to honor his debt. 
  The Dinandro official said that "if `Pablito' had to go to 
Madre de Dios, the debt must have been very large, and also the 
drug shipment that was sold to the Colombian."

  [Text] The Ministry of the Presidency reported yesterday 
that the government will begin projects to stop the progress of 
poppy cultivation, which increased last year in the departments 
of Amazonas, San Martin, and Huanuco, among others. 
  It has been reported that the sawmill of Santa Maria de 
Nieva, which is under the Jaen Apostolic Vicariate, will be 
reactivated. The reactivation plan also includes the Huaquilla 
mining settlement in the San Ignacio forest, which is up for 
bidding by the Privatization Committee for exploitation by the 
private sector. 
  Priority will also be given to the Mangunchay irrigation 
project and to another sawmill in the San Ignacio forest, which 
is located in the provinces of Jaen and San Ignacio de Cajamarca. 
  According to the Ministry of the Presidency, these projects 
are aimed at giving work to thousands of people who for lack of 
work are motivated to cultivate poppies. 
  According to a report published by this newspaper last 
month, 
poppy cultivation is increasing dangerously. There is 
information that there are small plantations in San Ignacio, 
Jaen, and Bambamarca in Cajamarca. 
  There are also plantations in Huancabamba, Piura; in Bagua 
and Condorcanqui, Amazonas; and in several towns in San Martin 
Department, where cultivation has spread rapidly over the last 
few years in Nueva Cajamarca, Rioja, Soritor, and in the valleys 
of Mayo, Sisa, and Biabo. 
  Outside the northern mountain range, the poppy grows in 
Sarampampa, Ayacucho Department. 
  The Ministry of the Presidency pointed out that the 
government will put into operation the reforestation of forests 
burned by farmers. This work will be done by the Japanese 
Tropical Wood International Organization and by the National 
Institute of Natural Resources (Inrena). 
  The Ministry of the Presidency admitted the imminent danger 
of the poppy, from which opium, morphine, and heroin are taken. 
This is why the government decided to stop poppy cultivation in 
northern Peru "before it becomes a chronic disease and the coca 
cartels escaping from Upper Huallaga settle down there." 
  The ministry said that according to the draft project of the 
National Plan for Drug Prevention and Control, prepared by the 
special commission headed by General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez, 
retired, "there are worrisome indications about the starting up 
of poppy cultivations in various parts of the national 
territory, encouraged by foreign interests linked to the heroin 
circuit." 
  The Ministry of the Presidency also said: "Hunger in that 
zone is so great that the poppy cultivations are gradually 
gaining more followers. The population is already urgently 
asking for private investment, and demanding from the government 
clear rules for sustainable forest development, forcing loggers 
to do reforestation work with a plan guaranteeing there will 
always be a forest." 
  Poppy grows in the same ecosystem as coca, but offers 
greater 
agro-economic advantages. 
  While cocaine base (the basic element for making cocaine) 
costs from $120 to $150 per kilogram, opium latex (the basic 
element for making heroin) costs $1,000 per kilogram. 
  Poppies grow under the same weather conditions as coca, 
giving better results at from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea 
level with cool temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees centigrade. 
  Regarding quantity and what could be called quality, poppies 
produce a greater volume of opium, which is of better quality 
among cultivations at high altitudes. 
  Poppies are planted from October to December to take 
advantage of the rainy season, and can also be planted in July 
and August. The planting is done by "throwing" the seeds onto 
the field.

  [Text] Lima -- The Peruvian Defense Ministry yesterday 
reported that Brazilian citizen Alcimar Marques da Silva and 
nine other individuals were arrested on 26 March in the town of 
Inapari, Peru, near the confluence of the Peruvian, Bolivian, 
and Brazilian borders. Soon after his arrest, the police found 
600 kg of cocaine base at the local airport. 
  Besides Alcimar, the group included two Colombians and seven 
Peruvians. They were intercepted by a Peruvian military patrol 
that was carrying out an operation against narcoterrorists, and 
could not give a reason for their presence in the area. Under 
questioning the men ended up confessing where the cocaine base 
shipment was hidden, ready for shipment. The same group was 
also discovered on 21 March, but were released as they had not 
been found to be in possession of anything. The 10 men arrested 
in Inapari were transferred by Peruvian military police to the 
city of Cusco, 1,150 km from La Paz. 
  The Peruvian military attribute to this 10-member gang a 
shipment of 400 kg of cocaine base on 18 March to the Colombian 
Cali cartel. The military reported that in the past two years 
coca plantations have increased in the area, as have poppy 
plantations. 
  The Brazilian Federal Police and the Foreign Ministry did 
not 
learn of the arrest of the Brazilian drug trafficker until late 
27 March.

  [Text] Caracas, 28 Mar (VENPRES) -- Division General 
Egberto Artuza Delgado, commanding general of the National 
Guard, has indicated that there has been a gradual increase in 
the past months in activity by Colombian narco-guerrillas 
[narcoguerrilla], particularly in the Amazonian area. Artuza 
Delgado said this at the end of a meeting with Pompeyo Marquez, 
special minister for border affairs, whom he briefed on the 
prevailing situation in the border area and the operations being 
conducted there by the National Guard. 
  Artuza Delgado pointed out that the National Guard is aware 
that drug traffickers have set up cocaine processing 
laboratories and have planted cocaine fields in Colombian 
territory near the Venezuelan Amazonian area. He explained that 
the existence of these cocaine fields also draws guerrillas 
closer since they are in charge of protecting production of the 
drug. Artuza Delgado termed this situation "very serious." 
  Later, referring to the resources the National Guard needs 
for border operations, he added that the National Guard is aware 
of the country's fiscal situation and that is why it has changed 
its conduct. According to Artuza, the National Guard will have 
to learn to manage the resources assigned for border operations 
more efficiently.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose G. Ramos] </F>
  [Text] Following a number of inspections along the border 
with Colombia, agents from DEA and other international 
organizations have determined that 80 percent of the drug 
traffic that passes through Venezuela--some 100-150 tonnes a 
year--crosses the border between the states of Zulia and Tachira. 
  MAS (Movement for Socialism) Deputy Julio Montoya has 
reported that the Perija Cartel [as published] has appeared 
along the Venezuelan border as a result of the displacement and 
reorganization of the Medellin Cartel's medium-level leaders. 
This comes after Colombian authorities dealt the drug 
traffickers smashing blows by killing or arresting their topmost 
leaders as part of the fight against drug trafficking in 
Colombia. 
  Montoya said he has proof that the kidnapping of cattlemen 
along the border--which occurred last year at the alarming rate 
of three kidnappings per month along the country's western 
border, and, so far this year, has risen to four per month--is 
the result of a plot being carried out by the Colombian drug 
cartels. He said the drug traffickers' strategy is to force 
hacienda owners to leave the area to allow traffickers to buy 
the abandoned property with laundered money. According to 
Montoya, "Once this is done, the region will become an 
operations center with the installation of labs and other 
infrastructures to process drugs." 
  According to the investigation conducted by Montoya, six of 
every 10 haciendas in the area have been put up for sale because 
of the hacienda owners' fear over the current situation. He 
said: "The effect on our agriculture and livestock industry is 
evident--lower production of beef, milk, and several 
agricultural products."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on drug-related crimes, investigations, trials, 
sentencings, and other activities in the PRC monitored by Hong 
Kong Bureau during the period 15-28 March. The source and mode 
of processing are given in parentheses at the end of each entry. 
  Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, border 
trade has developed rapidly, while transnational crime such as 
drug and gun trafficking have also become more rampant. Since 
last June, the People's Armed Police Guangxi Border Detachment 
has mainly cracked down on guns and drugs. In half a year, they 
have cracked 152 drug and gun cases; seized 1,463 guns of 
various kinds, including 217 army guns, 7,179 rounds of 
ammunition, and 418 hand grenades and antitank grenades; seized 
69,037 grams of opium and 7,099.4 grams of heroin; crushed 49 
gangs specialized in gun and drug trafficking; and arrested 239 
criminals involved in gun and drug crimes. Guangxi party Deputy 
Secretary Ding Tingmo said that Guangxi has a coastline of over

  Officials in charge of public security departments in 11 
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, including 
Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning and Shanghai, gathered in Shanghai to 
discuss with representatives from the Hong Kong police force the 
fight against organized crime committed by triads. The meeting 
was held amid the budding of some Hong Kong underground groups 
in the Mainland. Participants believed that the strengthening 
of cooperation between Mainland and Hong Kong police was 
necessary. The director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of 
the Ministry of Public Security stressed that underground forces 
from outside the borders were in no way sheltered in the 
Mainland. All members of illegal groups were harshly punished in 
accordance with the law once they were found guilty of 
committing crimes inside the Mainland. (Summary) (Beijing

  [Text] Beijing, April 3 (AFP)--The son of a former Chinese 
provincial police chief was executed for drug trafficking, after 
a superior court overturned a more lenient sentence that had 
provoked a public outcry, a report said Sunday [3 April]. Quan 
Xiaoyong, a member of the railway police force and son of the 
former chief of police in the northern province of Gansu, was 
sentenced to death and executed after a suspended death sentence 
handed down two years ago by an intermediate court was 
overturned. 
  Quan was a leading member of a 17-strong drug trafficking 
ring brought to trial in 1992 in the provincial capital of 
Lanzhou, the China Prosecution Daily said. While four leaders 
of the gang were sentenced to death and executed, Quan received 
a suspended death sentence, sparking public accusations of 
favouritism because of his family and professional connections, 
the newspaper said. 
  The provincial authorities ordered an investigation into the 
case, which took 18 months and resulted in the recent decision 
by the province's Superior People's Court to overturn the 
original judgement and sentence Quan to death. The same court 
also overturned a not-guilty verdict handed down to Li Jian, the 
son of a senior Gansu party official, who had been accused of 
acting as an accomplice to the gang's activities. The superior 
court sentenced Li to six months imprisonment.

  [Text] This morning, the Guangzhou City Intermediate 
People's Court announced the execution of criminal Ma Wengui and 
five other criminals whose death sentences and life-long 
deprivation of political rights had been confirmed by the 
provincial higher people's court. The six convicted drug 
traffickers were taken to an execution ground where they were 
shot in the head. 
  On 30 April, 1993, criminal Ma Guoying bought heroin in 
Yunnan and smuggled it into Guangzhou where he joined criminal 
Ma Wengui, who was looking for a buyer in the city. On 9 May, 
1993, Ma Wengui and Ma Guoying were caught red-handed by police 
while selling some 4,900 grams of heroin to a buyer in a 
Guangzhou hotel. Ma Wengui and Ma Guoying were later sentenced 
to death and deprived of political rights for life. 
  In April, 1992, criminals Mo Wenjian and Wei Jiping smuggled 
1,050 grams of heroin from Nanning into Guangzhou where they 
gave it to criminal Zheng Nanye, who was looking for a buyer in 
the city. On afternoon of 7 April, the three criminals were 
caught red-handed by police when Mo Wenjian and Wei Jiping went 
to collect money from Zheng Nanye who had just sold the heroin. 
Both Mo Wenjian and Wei Jiping were sentenced to death and 
deprived of political rights for life. Zheng Nanye was 
sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights 
for life. 
  In 1989, criminal Ma Zuohua bought 12,000 grams of heroin in 
Chengdu and asked another person to take it to Guangzhou by 
plane. Ma later received $50,000 Hong Kong dollars for his role 
in the deal. Ma Zuohua was sentenced to death and deprived of 
political rights for life. 
  In November, 1992, criminal Li Feng bought 4,000 grams of 
heroin in Yunnan and smuggled it into Guangzhou where he sold 
more than 1,700 grams of heroin to others. He was arrested by 
police later on. Li was sentenced to death and deprived of 
political rights for life.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hongtao (0491 3163 3447) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Senior 
Colonel Si Jiuyi, deputy to the National People's Congress and 
commander of the Yunnan Province Armed Police Corps, revealed at 
an exclusive interview with our staff reporter today that, in 
1993, the armed police and public security authorities in Yunnan 
cracked a total of over 4,000 drug cases, 27 of which were cases 
of armed drug trafficking; seized five metric tons of heroin and 
opium; and arrested over 6,000 criminals, among whom 473 were 
sentenced to death. 
  Si Jiuyi said: The drug problem is still very serious in 
Yunnan, as the temptation of money has encouraged large numbers 
of offenders to take the risk. The incidence of drug 
trafficking is showing an upward trend, and the following new 
developments have been observed. 
  An increase in major drug trafficking cases. After making 
some money, drug traffickers tend to try making colossal profits 
by engaging in transactions involving 100 kg, 200 kg, or even 
larger quantities of narcotics. 
  --A steady growth in armed drug trafficking. Because they 
are aware of the consequences they will face after being 
arrested, drug traffickers often fiercely resist the armed 
police. Last year, Yunnan police seized a total of 33 military 
firearms, 13 other firearms, and 50 hand grenades. 
  --Progressively better organized means of trafficking. Drug 
trafficking using cars and motorcycles is no longer a novelty. 
Criminals use mobile phones and walkie-talkies to communicate 
with one another and transport drugs through such methods as 
relaying or sending traffickers and drugs separately. 
  --The increase in sources of drugs. Drugs used to only come 
from Burma's Golden Triangle, but now they are infiltrating into 
China from Laos and Vietnam. Last year, Yunnan's border towns 
Honghe and Wenshan cracked over 200 drug cases originating from 
Laos and Vietnam. 
  The increase of drug traffickers from other provinces. Last 
year, Yunnan police arrested nearly 900 drug traffickers from 
other provinces, and the scope of areas they came from increased 
from 22 provinces and autonomous regions in the previous year to 
27 provinces and autonomous regions. Most active were drug 
traffickers from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and 
Xinjiang. 
  Senior Colonel Si Jiuyi explained that the antinarcotic work 
is currently in a very difficult stage. As Yunnan borders on 
Vietnam, Burma, and Laos, the residents in the border areas 
share customs and languages with those three countries, and the 
border markers are not very clear, thus posing enormous 
difficulty for antinarcotic operations. Drug traffickers tend 
to be desperadoes. They even have such slogans as "You can 
execute me, but my future generations will benefit" or "I may 
stay in jail for a while, but I will enjoy prosperity for the 
rest of my life." Criminal organizations give pensions to the 
families of arrested or executed drug traffickers. Another 
problem is that antinarcotic operations are short of funds and 
manpower and suffer from backward equipment. In one case, a 
drug-fighting unit leader had to chase a criminal by bicycle. 
In the end, the criminal got away in a car. 
  Si Jiuyi said: Drugs from Yunnan harm not only Yunnan, but 
also the entire country. The antidrug work is of vital 
importance. No matter how difficult it is, we must not let drugs 
and firearms flow inland. By adopting the tactic of blocking on 
the first front, investigating on the second front, and 
intercepting on the third front and by relying on the support of 
the masses, Yunnan armed police forces have been able to conduct 
a stern crackdown on drug crimes and can bring about a steady 
increase in the number of cases cracked over the years. Many 
armed policemen have proved themselves to be valiant fighters, 
have rendered meritorious services, and have received awards. 
Two of China's 10 Young People of the Year are antidrug heroes 
from Yunnan. Si Jiuyi also revealed that over 20 soldiers from 
the Yunnan armed police forces laid down their lives in antidrug 
battles over the past few years.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Squeeze Put on Drug Addiction in Yunnan"] </F>
  [Text] Southwest China's Yunnan province has made marked 
achievements in its narcotics control and rehabilitation of drug 
addicts. 
  One of the prominent accomplishments is the reduced number 
of 
drug addicts, a news release from the Public Security Ministry 
said yesterday. 
  Yunnan, which borders the notorious drug-trafficking "golden 
triangle" and has been used as a passageway by drug traffickers, 
previously had a large drug-addict population. 
  However, due to the province's expanded rehabilitation 
efforts, the number of addicts was reduced to 40,000 by the end 
of last year--a drop of 30 percent from 1990. 
  And the ranks of new addicts have been kept to 2,000 during 
each of the past three years. But before 1990, about five times 
as many new addicts became hooked each year. 
  Yunnan's drug addicts account for 16 percent of the total 
addict population in China. 
  Presently, more than 700 counties in 17 provinces, 
autonomous 
regions and municipalities have a problem with drug addiction. 
Growing numbers of addicts are particularly noted in Sichuan, 
Guizhou, Gansu, Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, statistics from 
the Public Health Ministry show. 
  To curb this increasing crime, China reorganized its 
high-level National Narcotics Control Commission last July to 
guide the overall effort. 
  The news release attributed Yunnan's achievements to the 
province's increased investment in its battle against drug 
offences and in law enforcement. 
  The province began to tighten its narcotics control in 1990. 
In the past two years, the State government and Yunnan 
provincial government have poured 16 million yuan (1.8 million) 
into renovating and setting up 28 rehabilitation centres. 
  More than 20,000 drug users receive treatment at these 
correction centres each year. The approach consists of medical 
treatment combined with tough social supervision. 
  As a result, 10 percent of treated addicts have completely 
overcome their addiction.

  [Text] At least 45 kilograms of marijuana being transported 
from Aceh to Jakarta by bus on the trans-Sumatra highway 
(JALINSUM) were netted in Jambi; some of the perpetrators are in 
custody and the evidence has been confiscated. 
  Police Colonel Drs Soeyono, head of the Jambi Regional 
Police, told reporters in Jambi on Saturday that JALINSUM is the 
main interregional route in Sumatra and that Jambi is in the 
middle of Sumatra. 
  He said that it is possible that the route is a 
transportation artery for "forbidden" goods destined for Java, 
especially for Jakarta, the main sales target. 
  He also did not deny that Jambi has become a transit point 
for the distribution of marijuana originating in Aceh and North 
Sumatra, which is proved by the fact that some residents of 
Jambi were involved as owners, dealers and users. 
  At the same time, Police Captain Drs Budi Soesilo, head of 
the investigative unit of the Jambi Regional Police, stated that 
the three suspects, MN. S. (31 years old), Pur (23 years old) 
and Mul (24 years old), all residents of Jambi, are in custody 
and charged with distributing marijuana. 
  The three suspects, residents of the Subdistrict of 
Rawasari, 
District of Kota Baru, Municipality of Jambi, were caught and as 
a result 1.2 kilograms of marijuana were confiscated. MN.S is 
believed to be the owner of the forbidden substance, which he 
obtained in Medan, North Sumatra. 
  In an operation called "zebra elephant," another marijuana 
case was uncovered in the Bungo Tebo Police Precinct, in the 
region crossed by the JALINSUM, in December of 1993, and at 
least 36 kilograms of marijuana were confiscated. 
  The three perpetrators arrested in that case are from North 
Sumatra and Aceh. "They were planning to take the marijuana to 
Jakarta," said Budi. 
  The three suspects are involved in two cases of marijuana 
belonging to a young woman named Men. T (36 years old), a 
resident of North Sumatra, and her male companion, Dnl (23 years 
old), from Aceh. 
  It is estimated that the two suspects, who confessed to 
taking the bus from Medan to Jakarta, were carrying 18.4 
kilograms of marijuana stored in the baggage compartment of the 
bus. 
  Meanwhile, the other perpetrator, Amr. S (49 years old), a 
resident of Aceh, was also carrying marijuana destined for 
Jakarta. "This case might have been handed over to the 
prosecutor already," he said. 
  Marijuana is usually transported on passenger busses where 
it 
is stored in the baggage compartment. However, some people also 
use vehicles which carry goods, such as trucks, and store the 
marijuana on the tarpaulin at the top of the bus. "It is 
possible that some people use other types of vehicles, including 
private vehicles," he added.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 22 Feb--Supplies of drugs that are 
easily obtained around the capital any time of day or night make 
the city a gathering place for drug users from all over the 
country. 
  This situation has enabled authorities to arrest many users 
in each operation it conducts, but limited detention facilities 
present authorities with problems in holding users longer for 
rehabilitation. 
  Ramil Abdul Samad, president of the Association of Former 
Drug Users (PENGASIH), said that the influx of users is because 
the capital for more than 10 years has been the center of the 
drug trade. 
  He said the drug traffic around the capital has become the 
focus of users from Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri 
Sembilan, and Johor, whereas users from the north gather in 
Pulau Pinang to get supplies. 
  "Users from those areas gather in the capital because of the 
ease in obtaining supplies, and they become vagrants living in 
dark lanes and under bridges," he said. 
  He explained that limited detention space forced the 
Enforcement Directorate of the Kuala Lumpur City Council (DBKL) 
to release 40 of the 56 vagrants detained at the beginning of 
this week. 
  In a joint operation by police and the Public Welfare 
Department (JKM), vagrants were arrested in the act of injecting 
drugs into their own bodies or in a state of hallucination after 
taking drugs. Some of them were among those released. 
  Ramli said that districts around the capital where 
small-scale drug traffickers gather to provide supplies to users 
include Puduraya, Bukit Bintang, Petaling Street, and the Chow 
Kit area.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 12 Feb--Kerinchi Kampong [community] 
is still "heaven" to drug traffickers and users, although police 
have made many raids and arrests in the area. 
  Because drug use and trafficking in the area are sometimes 
conducted openly, discontent has emerged among residents, who 
worry that their children will be snared by the unhealthy 
activities. 
  Some city residents call the community "the drug users' 
kampong." 
  Several kampong residents say they often encounter drug 
traffickers in the act of selling drugs to kampong teenagers. 
  Drug traffickers are also found roaming the apartment area 
looking for prey and trying to entice new users so that the 
drugs they sell will be in demand. 
  As a result, many of them use drugs on the steps of the 
apartment houses without any fear, ignoring the people passing 
back and forth. 
  A kampong resident, who did not want his name publicized, 
said he once rebuked a group of teenagers using drugs on the 
steps of a four-floor apartment house, but he merely incurred 
their anger. 
  Not only that, he said, but they also dared him to report 
their drug use to the police. 
  He added that the drug users not only gather on the 
apartment 
house steps, but foul the area with their vomit, urine, and 
excrement. 
  Moreover, residents worry about the growing number of thefts 
of clothing, shoes, and sandals, which they believe are stolen 
by drug users. 
  "We want those users to be arrested immediately, before the 
holidays, if possible," residents added. 
  Observation of the kampong by UTUSAN MALAYSIA found that 
traffickers and users choose strategic places for carrying on 
their activities without police interference. 
  The location believed to be used by them for their 
activities 
is somewhat hidden from public view and near a squatter kampong 
in the area. 
  Another resident said that every night without fail there 
are 
teenagers who gather and cause unpleasant conditions for 
residents. 
  "There are more of them on the nights of public holidays and 
on weekends," he said. 
  He added that he once rebuked the behavior of the teenagers, 
but five window panes and some sandals were stolen from his 
house, too. 
  Kerinchi Kampong is the area most wanted by people looking 
for rental houses because of its strategic location halfway 
between Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya. 
  As a result, many young people rent apartment units and 
squatter houses in the area. 
  Earlier, Second Senior Assistant Commissioner (PKP2) Hassan 
Mutalip, chief of the Kuala Lumpur Criminal Investigations 
Department, said that last year police conducted many raids and 
arrested dozens of drug traffickers and users in the kampong.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 25 January--Police have broken up a 
heroin drug distribution network in the Lembah Klang area 
following the arrest of three persons during a raid on a drug 
processing laboratory at Taman Desa Petaling [Petaling Village 
Center] on the afternoon of 24 January. 
  Assistant Principal Commissioner II Hassan Mutalip, chief of 
the Kuala Lumpur Office of Criminal Investigation, said that 
during the police raid the police also seized a variety of 
heroin processing equipment and a large quantity of drugs. 
  It is thought that the heroin seized weighed about 20 kg, 
including what had not yet been processed. 
  When Assistant Principal Commissioner Hassan Mutalip met 
with 
reporters in Kuala Lumpur on 25 January, he said: "Earlier this 
afternoon at around 1300 a police detachment from the Capital 
Anti-Drug Branch raided a block of flats at Winner Court B in 
Petaling Village Center." 
  "In the building police arrested two men and one woman in 
their 20's." 
  "Also during the raid the police seized eight blocks of 
material containing heroin which had not yet been processed and 
a large quantity of processed heroin." 
  Hassan said that the police believe that the flat which was 
raided was used by the men and the woman involved to process 
heroin there. 
  However, he said, the police are still investigating to 
determine how long the men and the women were processing heroin 
there. 
  According to him, the police are still interrogating the men 
and the woman who were arrested and will charge them under 
Section 39B of the Dangerous Substances Act of 1952, which 
carries the mandatory sentence of death by hanging if they are 
found guilty. It is thought that the men and woman who were 
arrested are members of a heroin distribution syndicate in the 
Lembah Klang area. 
  It is believed that the men and the woman converted the flat 
into a heroin processing center because it was outside the more 
crowded, central area of Lembah Klang.

  [Text] Johor Bahru, 15 Feb--On 15 February the Mahkamah 
Tinggi [High Court of the State of Johor] handed down a sentence 
of death by hanging to P. Jayamani T. Palanisamy, the owner of a 
retail shop, after he was found guilty of distributing 250 gr of 
marijuana four years ago. 
  Chief Justice Mohamed Ghazali Mohamed Yusoff handed down 
this 
sentence after he had heard arguments from the public prosecutor 
and counsel for the accused on 8 February. 
  When the sentence was announced, P. Jayamani seemed to be 
calm and even smiled briefly at several members of the High 
Court. 
  P. Jayamani, 30 years of age, was found to have committed 
the 
act of which he was accused at a coffee shop near Jalan Bayam 13 
in Permas Jaya at about 1430 on 26 January 1992. 
  He was arrested by a detective who had been given the task 
of 
acting like a person purchasing drugs from P. Jayamani at that 
time. 
  P. Jayamani was sentenced under the provisions of Section 
39B 
(1) (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952. 
  Previously, in his defense P. Jayamani told the High Court 
that he knew nothing about the contents of the plastic bag which 
he carried for delivery to two men. 
  P. Jayamani said that he was only asked to turn over the 
plastic bag tucked into his waist by a man known as Maniam who 
was related to his wife. 
  According to P. Jayamani, he did not open the plastic bag to 
find out what its contents were because he did not suspect 
anything. 
  However, when he arrived at the place indicated by Maniam, 
he 
met two men. They later asked him about the package which he had 
been asked to deliver. 
  P. Jayamani said that he was suddenly seized by a man 
standing behind him when he was asked to turn over the package 
to another man. Then he was handcuffed.

  [Text] A former Muntinglupa councilor and an official of 
the PNP Special Action Force were arrested for possession of 
shabu. 
  The former councilor arrested in the Philippine National 
Police Narcotics Command "buy-bust" operation is Carlo Tinsuan, 
who was caught redhanded with 10 grams of shabu (methamphetanine 
hydrochloride); and the PNP official who was also arrested is 
Chief Inspector Renato Panafiel, Jr., 42, of the PNP-SAF, 
residing at Block 51, Lot 14, Soldiers Hill Subdivision, 
Muntinglupa. 
  The PNP official arrested by the men of the Intelligence and 
Investigation Unit of the Makati Police was caught in the act of 
repacking the prohibited drug, shabu, in a cubicle at Topaz 
hydro massage on Yakal Street, Makati, at about 7:30 yesterday 
morning. 
  The raiding team confiscated 16 grams of the prohibited 
shabu, 100 pieces of plastic pouches, and shabu paraphernalia. 
  Inspector Bernardo confirmed receiving information to the 
effect that Penafiel often went to the said hydro massage parlor 
in order to distribute the said shabu to the lady attendants. 
  Likewise, according to NARCOM director Senior Superintendent 
Ramsey Ocampo, after the suspect Carlo Tinsuan was arrested, the 
Narcotics Authorities seized the owner-type jeep he was driving, 
and, in addition, 10 more grams of shabu were found. 
  It was learned during the course of the investigation that 
the 34-year-old Tinsuan was surrounded by NARCOM men after he 
delivered prohibited drugs to one of the agents in front of the 
Smokey Restaurant in Muntinglupa. 
  Ocampo stated that the South Metro District Unit of the 
NARCOM laid the trap last Tuesday in a hotdog house in 
Muntinglupa. 
  Currently Tinsuan is being held in the National Bilibid 
Prison Reservation Area in Muntinglupa at the NARCOM 
headquarters in Camp Crane.

crops, skepticism and caution are still the order of the day. 
  Even within the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, voices can 
be heard denouncing a program "doomed to failure before it even 
begins," according to one agronomist. He adds: "There is 
currently no alternative to cannabis growing." 
  The EC, which is primarily where Morocco turned in February 
1993 to request a financial contribution equal to the amount 
being allocated by the kingdom, is still dragging its feet. The 
modest sum of DH125 million that was appropriated last December 
to finance jobs, modernize agriculture, and improve health in 
the region in question is far less than Moroccan authorities 
expected. 
  The Twelve [the EC], concerned in particular about the 
trafficking in cannabis resin (Europeans consume 30 percent of 
the some 700 metric tons of hashish produced every year), are 
frightened by the size of the sums at stake. "Twelve billion 
francs represents one-tenth of our annual development effort," a 
Commission spokesman emphasized. 
  That cautious attitude exasperates the Moroccans. When he 
announced his eradication plan, Hassan II denounced "those 
international middlemen and traffickers who peddle cannabis 
resin and oil in Europe and make 50 times more profit than the 
peasants growing that crop." 
  The fact is that the consuming countries bear a great 
responsibility for the trafficking in question. The very rapid 
expansion in cannabis acreage over the past 10 years or so is 
largely due to the consuming frenzy of the Europeans, who are 
encouraged by more or less permissive legislation in their own 
countries. 
  In the 1970's, many pushers rushed to the Rif mountains, 
where growing and consuming Indian hemp was a centuries-old 
tradition. The peasants, hard hit by drought and severe soil 
erosion--2 percent of the soil washes into the Mediterranean 
every year--found cannabis an easy solution to their problems. 
The inevitable consequence was that the area planted in cannabis 
went from 6,000 to 50,000 hectares in 15 years! The crop was 
confined to the Ketama region at first, but now it stretches for 
more than 150 km between Tetouan and Al Hoceima. It is a real 
industry and one that pays off big: the annual turnover exceeds 
DH20 billion--the same as the budget earmarked for the five-year 
eradication plan. This hidden sector is as important to the 
Moroccan economy as earnings from emigrants. The money, which is 
often reinvested in real estate, generally in Spain, also 
benefits big Moroccan traffickers. The rising power of tightly 
structured gangs is a considerable hindrance to the Moroccan 
Government, which is in the midst of negotiating a partnership 
agreement with the European Union and cannot allow mafia-like 
practices to develop in its territory on a large scale. 
  Combined with that desire for "honorability" abroad is the 
need at home to combat a traffic that not only increases 
corruption among officials but also hastens the emergence of a 
new social class consisting of farmers enriched by cannabis and 
increases the risk of secession by a region traditionally 
jealous of its independence. As far back as the latest municipal 
elections (in 1992), nearly 440 candidates linked to the drug 
traffic--and more interested in a legal cover for their criminal 
activity than in the affairs of their municipalities--had to be 
stricken from the ballot. Others managed to get elected thanks 
to blackmail, bribery, or physical violence. 
  It was in that context that the King banged the table with 
his fist and began a wrestling match with the traffickers. Since 
then, a real quarantine line has been set up around the 
production area, and police checks have been stepped up. 
  "The roads to Tangier and Casablanca are being increasingly 
guarded," says one Ketama resident. 
  That repressive action, undertaken largely at the behest of 
the Europeans, who have made it "an indispensable condition for 
the success of the program," is beginning to worry all those in 
the Rif who are dependent in one way or another on drug money. 
  The fact is that the ambitious program to develop the North 
is not very attractive to the some 200,000 cannabis growers. It 
calls for replacing kif with appropriate crops such as fruit, 
almonds, and figs, opening up a region where some villages are 
accessible only by donkey, and providing sizable infrastructure 
(roads, drinking water supply, electrification, and so on). 
  "It will take a long time to combat this scourge because 
cannabis is very profitable," says Hamid, a stockraiser faced 
with the slow disappearance of grazing land as the inevitable 
consequence of deforestation linked to the illegal growing of 
kif. Other farmers do not hesitate to say that "the authorities 
close their eyes" to the trafficking. According to the 
Geopolitical Drug Observatory (OGD), it is publicly rumored that 
the highest state authorities have benefited from the traffic. 
  Another problem to be solved is this: a planter who grows 
cannabis can hope to earn DH30,000 (18,400 French francs) per 
hectare annually, or 10 times what he would earn by growing 
almonds. 
  Among the small-time pushers who make the trip from 
Casablanca to Ketama every month to buy hashish despite the 
increasing risks, no one believes that cannabis growing can be 
stopped. "It supports too many families, and the peasants are 
often in debt to the big traffickers," says Rahal, who is one of 
those pushers. Another problem in this mountainous area is that 
of achieving participation by the local population, which is 
historically resistant to any "interference" by the central 
government. All the more, says one academic in the capital, 
since "the authorities all too often confuse participation with 
political control." Other development programs for these 
northern provinces were launched by the FAO [UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization] and the World Bank in the 1980's, and 
they were a complete failure. But this eradication program is 
still the first of its scope in the world. Unlike the program in 
Mexico, it is not limited to the destruction of drug plantations 
by napalm with no regard for the farmers' future. It is true 
that keeping the inhabitants in the Rif and improving their 
standard of living by licit means is essential to avoid an 
inordinate increase in the rural exodus and emigration. Most of 
the Moroccan immigrants in Europe are from this deprived area. 
  Denounced by the kingdom's media and lacking an ambitious 
financial aid policy, the Twelve, "with their logic of the 
lowest cost," might very well find themselves faced with the 
following dilemma: more hashish available for European consumers 
or more immigrants. In either case, the limits of repressive 
measures have been revealed.

  [Text] Watchers of the Syrian scene and arrivals from 
Syria report that Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, 
met his death at the hands of drug gangsters operating in 
Lebanon. 
  According to some reliable sources, Basil was killed in 
Lebanon, having received threats in connection with the hush 
money he had been receiving from hashish growers and smugglers. 
He had been suspected of planning to swindle the traffickers 
and control the market. 
  The sources indicate that the news of Basil's death, 
officially caused by an auto crash, was broken two days after 
its actual date. Nor was there any picture of the accident that 
could be shown on Syrian television. 
  Observers note that Lebanese factions, the Maronites in 
particular, were keen to send delegations to pay their last 
respects, lest any be suspected of involvement in his 
assassination and then bear the vengeance of Syrian intelligence 
services. 
  The observers are confident that the next few days will bear 
out their assessment. A tradition of the al-Nasiriyah sect 
calls for the deceased's face to be uncovered for a final 
glimpse, which was not observed in the case of Basil al-Asad.

  [Text] The Syrian Foreign Ministry has stated the 
following: 
  For many years, the Syrian authorities, in cooperation with 
the Lebanese authorities, have been exerting themselves to 
combat the growing of poppies and other narcotics, especially in 
the al-Biqa' region, long known for producing such crops. 
  We can state, on the strength of the information available 
to 
us, that these efforts have succeeded in putting an end to the 
cultivation of these illegal plants, despite the extreme 
difficulties involved in combating them, curbing their 
processing, and banning trade in them. 
  Syria is known to have passed strict anti-drug legislation 
and taken severe disciplinary measures against drug growers, 
manufacturers, smugglers, and traffickers. Syria ranks among 
the countries with the cleanest record in this area. 
Furthermore, the values and traditions of the Syrian Arab 
society in themselves constitute a natural immunity against this 
blight. 
  Syria's efforts in the area of fighting drugs have earned 
the 
satisfaction of the United Nations and the regional committee 
for the fight against drugs, which chose Damascus as the venue 
for its 30th congress in February, 1994. The committee's 
representative judged Syria's anti-drug drive to be commendable. 
  For all the above reasons, and despite the fact that the 
competent agency at the U.S. State Department recommended that 
Syria be removed from the list of nations charged with failing 
to combat drug abuse--to cite an article published in the 21 
March issue of the WASHINGTON POST--certain members of the U.S. 
Administration, many of whose stands have hindered rather than 
facilitated the peace process, have deliberately ignored these 
recommendations, and insisted on keeping Syria on the list, 
despite all the realities and facts that prove Syria's fight 
against drugs. 
  It is now clear beyond a shadow of doubt that the aim of 
placing Syria on the drug or terrorism list is to pressure Syria 
into relinquishing its stands and just causes, acknowledged by 
the international community and endorsed by UN resolutions, 
envisaging a just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Syria's stands and just causes cannot be bargained over. 
Syria's efforts and measures in the anti-drug campaign 
originate in a conviction in the need to wipe out the risks 
inherent in this scourge and its devastating impact on 
individuals and societies in this region and elsewhere. 
  Syria is not looking for a reward from anyone for its 
anti-drug and anti-terror efforts. Syria would not have issued 
this statement if it were not for the attempts of certain 
circles in the United States to misrepresent facts and falsify 
records to advance political pressure that will only shake the 
confidence of the region in the role of the United States as an 
honest broker in the peace process.

  [Text] Damascus, April 2 (AFP) -- The official press here 
on Saturday accused the "Zionist" lobby of helping to keep Syria 
on a US list of nations involved in the international drug trade 
and trying to sabotage better ties between Damascus and 
Washington. 
  Syria's Tishrin daily denounced "the refusal of US 
congressmen who are close to the Zionist lobby, and who do not 
really like the Syrian-US rapprochement, to remove Syria's name 
from the list." 
  Such behavior was "proof of hostile and aggressive 
intentions 
against Syria," which had taken the necessary steps to curb the 
transit of drugs across its territory, the paper said, adding 
that Syria was not a producer country. 
  Tishrin recalled that in April 1993 a law was adopted 
requiring the death penalty for those convicted of growing, 
producing and trafficking drugs. 
  A White House statement on Friday said that Syria had done 
little to combat drug trafficking. 
  The State Department had initially wanted to exempt Syria 
from the list to reward it for helping to press the Palestine 
Liberation Organization back into peace talks, The New York 
Times reported Friday. 
  But legislators denounced the State Department's 
maneuvering, 
given Syria's poor record in stopping the opium trade in the 
al-Biqa Valley in Lebanon, an area largely controlled by Syria, 
the Times said. 
  Mindful of the explosiveness of granting concessions to 
Syria, Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled 
lower-ranking officials who had recommended the exemption. 
  Syria is due to resume bilateral peace talks with Israel 
later this month.

  [Text] The task force on hard drugs has mapped out new 
strategies to eradicate drug trafficking. They include the use 
of lectures, conferences, seminars, as well as symposia and a 
massive public enlightenment campaign to educate the public on 
the consequences of drug abuse. In addition, more tribunals 
have to be set up throughout the country to try drug offenders. 
The chairman of the task force, Brigadier General (Ishaya 
Bamaiyi), gave the information yesterday in Lagos when members 
of the task force visited some foreign embassies and high 
commissions in the country. He advised the international 
community to assist the federal government in its efforts to 
eradicate drug abuse.

<F P=106> ["Hop"-signed article: "The Importance of the Czech </F>
Republic in the Heroin Trade Is Growing"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Czech police managed within a week to 
seize 25 kg of pure heroin, which is almost eight kg more than 
was seized over the entire previous year. These figures 
together with the statistics of drugs seized in Western Europe, 
which the smugglers evidently transported through the territory 
of the Czech Republic (less than 750 kg in 1992, 997 kg last 
year), testify to the steadily growing quantity of heroin in 
transit and to the important status of the Czech Republic on the 
so-called Balkan route. A total in excess of 8,000 kg of heroin 
was seized in all European states last year, which is one-half 
more than in 1988. 
  Two branches of this smuggling path go through the Czech 
Republic. One leads from Istanbul, Turkey, through Sofia, 
Belgrade, Budapest, and Prague to the Waldhaus border crossing. 
The other branch passing through the Czech-German border begins 
in Constanta, Romania. In both instances, the final destination 
for the narcotics is Scandinavia and Western Europe. According 
to police sources, only a marginal part of the narcotics remains 
in the Czech Republic. Because of the high price of heroin, its 
users are recruited mostly from business circles. Jiri Richter, 
director of the National Drug and Information Service, comments 
on this: "Recently, the participation of the Czech citizens in 
various crime organizations involved in drug smuggling has 
grown. It is understandable--the Czech cleverness, longing for 
money, and skills are rather expedient features for the 
narcotics trade." 
  One of the important sites for drug smuggling is the 
[Prague-] Ruzyne airport. Drug couriers from Asia, Africa, and 
South America come to Prague, and then continue to other parts 
of Europe by car or train. Because of the limited technical 
possibilities and lack of legislation, the Prague airport is 
becoming a suitable transfer point for smugglers. 
  Drug-crime specialists point out that the interest in the 
Czech Republic on the part of dealers is not declining because 
dirty money can be laundered here without many problems. 
According to them, the individual gangs will attempt to 
penetrate the highest political and social strata.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 30/3/1994 -- The narcotics 
police uncovered about 315 kilograms of hashish hidden at the 
residence of a Romanian citizen in the Maramures County, 
north-western Romania. The drug was found packed in several 
hundred parcels tin-veiled [as received], inscripted in Italian 
language, and buried in the garden. 
  The police discovered also under the kitchen floor of a home 
in another village in the Maramures County a Dutch made vacuum 
packing machine suspected to be employed in drugs packing. 
  While continuing investigations in this area at the 
north-western border of Romania, the police uncovered an entire 
ring of drugs smugglers. Some other inhabitants of the same 
county are suspected to be involved in trafficking a great deal 
of hashish coming from Lebanon to Constanta, Romanian port at 
the Black Sea. After a short leg to the packing machine, the 
hashish was being sent to the Netherlands, crossing the Romanian 
border in trucks loaded with apples and wine. Over 5 tonnes of 
hashish are believed to have been conveyed to the Netherlands in 
three trucks. The investigation continues with some of the 
suspects placed under arrest.

<F P=106> [Article by Saso Colakovski: "Dealers in Dreams"] </F>
  [Text] The growing presence of drugs in our country, 
especially heroin, which is being distributed on a large scale 
in the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] drug market because of the closure of the 
channels of the "Balkan drug route," is bringing this problem to 
the surface in all its seriousness; the army of petty dealers is 
being created from drug addict circles; the "nebulous" figure 
being used is about 4,000 hard drug addicts in our country. 
  The history of drug smuggling and abuse in this region is 
more or less known: The use of narcotic drugs in Macedonia, 
inevitably associated with our country's capital, was recorded 
for the first time in the distant year of 1969, and the first 
"retail" dealers in Skopje were discovered a little over five 
years ago. Since then, to the present date, it has all been 
evolving explosively both in terms of the size of the clientele, 
and with respect to what represents drug dealer networks of the 
most sophisticated sort. The police data on the distribution of 
smuggling channels state the following: During the period from 
1991 to 1992, a total of 10 drug channels were discovered, and 
38 kilograms of heroin, 22 kilograms of raw opium, and 12 
kilograms of marijuana were seized. Meanwhile, however, in just 
the past year 47 drug smuggling cases have been discovered, 102 
individuals have been charged, and a little over 78 kilos of 
heroin, four kilograms of raw opium, 15 kilograms of marijuana, 
and 75 containers of various narcotics have been seized.... All 
of this indicates that during the past three years Macedonia, 
from a transit crossroads on the "Balkan route" to Europe for 
drugs, is slowly turning into a true drug market. One of the 
main reasons for this is the increased problems with 
transporting drugs through the already established Balkan 
channels (in view of the current instability in this region), so 
that an enormous quantity of narcotic drugs is being left, i.e., 
sold, in our country. In spite of the above-mentioned 
difficulties, the "Balkan route" is still in operation, although 
with an extremely reduced length--the last stop, under these 
conditions, is Belgrade now, instead of the West European 
centers. Naturally, the amounts of drugs distributed along this 
route have also suffered restrictions. 
  Proceeding in chronological order, when it had already 
become 
obvious that the drug channel following the path that we call 
the "Fraternity and Unity" highway was becoming unusable, the 
international drug mafia was forced to establish new alternative 
routes. Macedonia, however, is still marked on the maps of the 
big heroin bosses as one of the key spots on the East-West route 
for drugs. Thus, for example, recently the heroin channel from 
Turkey, which supplies the drug markets in Italy, France, and 
Spain, goes through our country. The route more or less looks 
like this: The starting point is Turkey, it goes through 
Bulgaria, it enters our country at the Deve Bair border crossing 
and leaves at the Cafasan crossing, then goes from the Albanian 
port of Durres to Bari in Italy, and it is distributed from 
there to the Apennine and Iberian peninsulas. All of this is of 
exceptional importance for us, since parts of these heroin 
shipments remain to be distributed in the drug market in our 
country. (Fortunately, the smuggling channel that distributes 
heroin for the Central European centers and Scandinavia, and 
goes from Turkey, through Bulgaria, Romania, and the Czech 
Republic bypasses us.) 
<H5>  The Main Bosses in the Background </H5>
  All the roads of the drug business in our country, however, 
lead to and from the Macedonian capital. Without the slightest 
exaggeration of the problem, drugs are "dealt" in Skopje in 
virtually every dark alley of the Old Quarter, according to 
experts on the Skopje underground. They add that what the 
Medellin cartel is to Colombia and the world, the Carsija [old 
marketplace] is to Skopje and Macedonia. Those using the 
services of the Skopje heroin dealers (or 
euphemistically--"dream dealers") know very well where and in 
which spot they can ask for "something white": in teahouses 
obscured by tobacco smoke, inns, and the sinister pathways 
around the Jaja Pasha mosque. The left bank of the Vardar is no 
longer the only place "privileged" for "retail" heroin--the 
dealers are aggressively moving to the right side as well.... 
  The "retail" dealers on the street, however, are only the 
last "operatives" in the forefront and the absolutely final 
category of subordinates in the elaborately organized hierarchy 
of the drug mafia. The main bosses, however, are always in the 
background, far out of sight. As a rule, everything starts with 
Turkey, the main supplier of heroin for the Macedonian drug 
market, but also for the far more discriminating West European 
drug market. The main organizers and financers of the heroin 
channels (usually concealed behind the screen of successful 
businessmen dealing in textiles, leather, food...), through 
their assistants, purchase the drugs from Afghanistan or 
Pakistan in the form of opium cakes, or even as finished refined 
heroin, produced by the primitive laboratories hidden in the 
Kurds' stony wastelands. 
  In this whole chain, no one actually knows who are the real 
bosses and organizers, the main profiteers in this whole 
business. (To illustrate, a kilogram of heroin costs 
18,000-20,000 German marks [DM] "wholesale" in Turkey, and its 
price in the Macedonian drug market is DM45,000, while in the 
European centers, for example in Switzerland or Austria, heroin 
achieves a price of as much as DM100,000 per kilogram; we note 
that the price increases several-fold for "retail" sale.) 
  The statement by 27-year-old Skopje resident F.Z., who 
"earned" a sentence of one year and three months in prison for 
smuggling close to half a kilogram of heroin, virtually does not 
deviate at all from the standard milieu of the people who are in 
the drug chain. 
  "Sometime in the spring of the year before last, two people 
I 
knew came up to me at a table in the teahouse and said to me, 
`Do you want some money?' Who doesn't...? And I agreed to be 
their `mule,' '' F.Z. said. "They knew me from before while I 
was in business... I had dealt the `white stuff' retail, from 
time to time, but until then I had never carried it across the 
border. We agreed that they would give me a car, an old BMW--and 
first I was supposed to get a rent-a-car but they changed their 
minds--they gave me some money and the address of a hotel in 
Istanbul. And, they told me, `You will park the car in such and 
such a parking lot, you will stay there for three days, and 
afterwards you will come back.' It seemed easy to me, and they 
were supposed to pay me DM1,000." 
<H5>  Dealers Who Are Drug Addicts </H5>
  "When I arrived in Istanbul, I parked the car where they 
told 
me and went to the hotel. During the two days that I stayed 
there, they `padded' the BMW and put some goods in it, 
textiles... They caught me here, someone `squealed on' me... We 
fell, me and three others--them as the organizers and me as the 
mule." 
  If one could speak a few years ago of "pure" drug addicts 
and 
"pure" dealers, now this line has been erased--the army of petty 
dealers is being created from drug addict circles, according to 
police information. Both categories are closely dependent upon 
each other. The dealers' working methods are well-known--in most 
cases they choose the victims themselves. As a rule, they always 
give the first dose for free, "as friends," they reel in the 
victim, and then--the horror starts! In the last two years, one 
more phenomenon in the drug addiction problem here has become 
urgent: Previously, in drug addict practice several years had to 
pass from the first "joint" of marijuana, through pills and 
opium teas, to the first dose of "horse" (heroin), but now the 
latest trend among drug addicts is to go to "hard" drugs 
directly. What is even more disturbing, however, is that the new 
victims of the "white powder" are even entering the world of 
drugs in their early teens. Curiosity is usually cited as the 
motive for trying drugs. 
  This is precisely what is confirmed by the specific figures 
on registered drug addicts in the Skopje Outpatient Hospital for 
Dependencies, which state that the age threshold is declining 
every year, and in certain cases is down to 14-15 years old. 
There are around 500 officially registered drug addicts in our 
country (more precisely, 457), and in the last two years this 
figure has been rising continuously and explosively. This 
figure, naturally, by no means reflects the real situation, 
since it is not difficult to assume that there are many times 
more unregistered drug addicts. People are using the figure of 
4,000, but skeptics claim that there are at least that many more 
of them. In this case, in addition to those dependent upon 
"hard" drugs, this includes those who consume the "soft" drugs, 
such as marijuana, for example. Understandably, Skopje, as the 
domestic drug center, accounts for over two-thirds of the drug 
addicts, and concerning the distribution of drug addiction with 
all of its "attributes," one can also speak of Ohrid, Gevgelija, 
Tetovo, Stip, Struga, Radovis, Veles, Kumanovo, and Bitola. 
  It is also characteristic of the cities in the eastern part 
of Macedonia, however, that this climate is exceptionally 
suitable for cultivating the plant cannabis sativa, from which 
marijuana is obtained. The main center is the village of 
Stojakovo near Gevgelija, followed by Strumica, Radovis, and 
Valandovo. Usually the cannabis seed is purchased in the 
Netherlands by those involved in the illegal cultivation of this 
plant, and they locate the "plantations" in hidden places near 
the water. The seeds are planted in the spring, the leaves are 
gathered in September, and the stalks, from which the best 
marijuana is actually obtained, can grow up to three or four 
meters. Cakes of poppy tar (opium cakes which are the basis for 
the morphine base from which heroin is produced) are still 
stored in this part of our country, and occasionally these old 
stocks are distributed in our drug market. 
<H5>  How To Get an Effective Model </H5>
  Now, the question of how to prevent the illegal trafficking 
and abuse of narcotic drugs is justifiably becoming more and 
more topical. Dr. Metodija Angeleski, a lecturer at the Security 
School in Skopje, explained his observations on the problem in 
the specialized journal BEZBEDNOST, issue 4 in 1993. He said 
that the role of the unifying director and coordinator of all 
the activities in the struggle against drug abuse should be 
assumed by a special government body. His program, he 
emphasized, included in addition to general social measures 
standardized programs for individual state bodies, 
organizations, and other entities, such as the police, the 
customs service, the judicial system, health care, social 
welfare organizations, etc. 
  As a counter to this, however, the idea of legalizing the 
"soft" drugs is being more and more widely disseminated among 
the Macedonian public, as one of the long-term solutions to the 
problem of narcotics abuse. Professional experts from West 
European countries are still arguing over this idea, since 
according to their information gathered over many years, 
prohibitions have only yielded barren results. Perhaps the Dutch 
model has gone furthest in this regard. According to a 
presentation by Teo Laus, a psychologist for drug addicts who is 
a member of the Dutch state health organization, given at the 
First Congress on Dependency in Macedonia, held in Skopje in 
November 1993, punishing drug users unfairly limits the freedom 
of adults to use substances (i.e., marijuana) which are not more 
dangerous than those that can be purchased legally, such as 
tobacco and alcohol! In this regard, the sale of "soft" drugs 
has been semilegalized in the Netherlands, and marijuana, for 
example, is sold in specialized shops; the purpose of this model 
is primarily to differentiate the consumers of "soft" drugs from 
the other ones. According to the latest information, this Dutch 
model is finding more and more advocates in other countries as 
well, such as Germany, Italy, France, and the Scandinavian 
countries. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  Dr. Slavica Gajdasic, Writer: "There Is No AIDS Among Skopje </H5>
Drug Addicts!" 
  "During just this January, 10 new cases of individuals 
dependent upon narcotics were registered at the Outpatient 
Hospital for Dependencies in Kisela Voda. What is more alarming 
is the fact that all 10 cases involve individuals under 20.'' 
  "Since drug addicts are included in the critical groups that 
are vulnerable to the danger of infection with the AIDS virus, 
all new patients reporting to the outpatient hospital are 
required to have an AIDS test. None of the 60 drug addicts 
currently registered at this hospital is HIV-positive! According 
to the latest information, the incubation period for the AIDS 
virus is 100 days, and for that reason all our drug addict 
patients are sent for retesting--young people every three 
months, and older ones every six months. The tests are done at 
the Clinic for Infectious Diseases and Febrile Conditions." 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  "I Got All the Way Off With Heroin!" </H5>
  "I am on marijuana, or if you want more, I was for seven or 
eight years. It was domestic marijuana, from Gevgelija. 
Occasionally, and then more and more often, I used opium tea and 
became addicted to it. We gathered pods from the poppies that 
grow in eastern Macedonia and brewed tea. With one cup of tea, 
you `flash' for two hours (this term is used in drug addict 
jargon for the first few hours when the effect from the drugs is 
the greatest--author's note), and then it `holds' you for maybe 
another 20 hours. I was completely dependent on the tea. The 
crises when there was no tea were terrible: vomiting, spasms, 
pains in my muscles and bones... Then on one occasion I tried 
heroin, `horse,' and got all the way off it. In the beginning it 
was beautiful for me, really OK. Then everything became hell! In 
one month, I thought that I could not survive without heroin," 
26-year-old Toni T. told us his terrible story. 
  "When a friend of mine started to smoke marijuana 10 years 
ago, I tried somehow to get him off of it, but in time I got in 
trouble too, even more than him. You know, we associated with 
drug addicts, but for a long time we stayed with just a joint of 
marijuana and opium tea. But afterwards... There was nothing I 
didn't use. Three years ago I sniffed heroin for the first time, 
and at that time I told myself that I would go ahead and try it, 
and I wouldn't die from just one time. But after a few doses I 
couldn't do without it anymore. I smoked horse, I snorted it, 
and several times I injected it. Then my friend and I were 
already deeply dependent on heroin. At that point we didn't even 
care about pleasure anymore, only about being normal and 
surviving. I became numb and nothing interested me anymore. But 
even before I started with heroin, I knew from the experiences 
of some of my other drug addict friends that their hair was 
falling out, that their teeth were falling out, their insides 
were collapsing, they didn't look like people, but I tried it 
anyway," Goran T. said. 
  Our conversation with them was conducted recently at one of 
the "renowned" Skopje cafes, while the two of them were under 
treatment for "getting off" their dependency, and they said that 
they wanted to get out of the hell of heroin. A few days ago, 
however, both of them left "state treatment" and are on the 
street again, hunting for the white powder. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  Prof. Djordji Marjanovic--"Legalization of `Soft' </H5>
Drugs--Yes!" 
  Prof. Djordji Marjanovic is of the opinion that the 
criminalization of drug abuse is essential, but basically it 
should be proportionate to the purpose for which it is intended. 
Thus, in his opinion, the drug addicts who use "soft" drugs like 
marijuana should be allowed to do so. Meanwhile, registered 
consumers of "harder" drugs should be given doses of 
substitutes, like methadone, for example, prescribed, specified, 
and controlled by a doctor, at specific "drugstores." This, 
according to Marjanovic, would avoid the abuse and resale of 
drugs. At the same time, he does not support positions opposing 
efforts against drug addiction, but instead urges respect for a 
citizen's freedoms and his right to choose. 
  "Legalizing soft drugs would solve the illegal trafficking 
and production of narcotics. When drugs are legalized, the 
producers, smugglers, and dealers will no longer be attracted as 
strongly.... And society would also benefit in this case, since 
through legalization it would get its own piece of the pie, 
which would not be a small one. This money would thus be used in 
the struggle against drug abuse as a social evil, in the medical 
treatment of addicts, but above all for the prevention of this 
social anomaly. This is because if drug addicts use drugs as a 
ticket to escape from reality, then there is something in 
reality that has to be changed," Dr. Marjanovic thinks.

  [Text] Vienna -- Vienna police have busted a drug ring and 
seized 52 grams of heroin with a black market value of about 
40,000 schillings and almost 3 kg of hashish. Investigations 
had been under way since September 1993. 
  In total, eight persons were found, but the heads of the 
drug 
ring, the couple Peter (42) and Ritua S. (38), have disappeared 
without a trace. The two are probably in India. From there the 
drugs had been smuggled to Austria for years, by means of 
condoms filled with drugs, which were swallowed. In the course 
of the investigations, a cocaine link with Poland was also 
discovered.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Drug Dealer Gang Busted"] </F>
  [Text] Officers of the Lower Austrian Department of 
Criminal Investigation and the Task Force for the Combating of 
Drug Crime (EBS) of the Interior Ministry have laid an 
international gang of drug dealers by the heels. A Belgian, a 
Pakistani, an Afghan, and an Iranian citizen are under arrest. 
Information has been laid against a Serb. 
  On Sunday, through the mediation of the other two men, the 
Belgian and the Pakistani tried to sell 1,040 grams of heroin. 
However, the customer was an undercover agent of the Interior 
Ministry, the Lower Austrian Security Directorate stated. 
  According to the investigations, Zahid Mushtag M. (33), who 
is resident in Gent, had taken the 1,040 grams of heroin in a 
rented car from Belgium via Germany to Austria last week on 
Saturday. On the next day, the man wanted to sell the drug for 
650,000 schillings together with Pakistani Hussain Tahir M. 
(38), who is, among others, registered in Vienna-Favoriten. 
Afghan citizen Ahmad Zia R. (29), who is resident in 
Vienna-Leopoldstadt, and Iranian Mehrdad S. (24), who is 
registered in Traunkirchen in the Gmunden District, mediated the 
deal. The customer turned out to be an undercover agent. 
  According to the officers, Serb Bozidarka T. (40), who is 
resident in Vienna-Favoriten, is presumably an accomplice. When 
the apartment of the Serb was searched, 42,000 schillings were 
seized. The money probably comes from Hussain M.'s drug deals, 
the investigators stated.

  [Text] International gangs use Cyprus to launder money made 
from the sale of drugs or arms. 
  For several months American police have had information that 
an international gang has succeeded in using Cyprus to launder a 
large amount of money received from the sale of drugs. 
  According to our information, the American police and the 
Cypriot police are cooperating to investigate this case and 
locate the people behind it. 
  In the past, Cyprus has been used to transfer dirty money 
overseas, a case in which Canadian police showed great interest. 
  Cyprus is being used as a transit point in the drug trade, 
but recently it has developed a market of its own. Many illegal 
trade gangs prefer Cyprus because it is very easy to "legalize" 
their money.

<F P=106> [Article by Anders Wiig: "Narcotics Gangster Sentenced Under </F>
False Name"] 
  [Text] Cocaine Gang: The man who was pointed 
out as a gang leader was arrested in Vridlose and jailed 
yesterday. He would not talk to the police. The chief of 
narcotics thinks he can be held for abuse. 
  A Colombian drug gangster was able to be sentenced in 
Denmark 
under a false name. Yesterday, as the fingered leader of a 
recently detected cocaine gang, he was again brought before 
Copenhagen's magistrate court. 
  Gustavo Hernando Barrero Rubiano is what he called himself 
when he was arrested in February 1992 in a hotel room where a 
pistol with live ammunition was hidden together with a stash of 
cocaine. This name also stands on his magistrate court sentence 
of three years in prison from 2 September 1992. Yesterday, when 
he came before the judge and was jailed for being behind the 
smuggling and the attempted smuggling of at least 45 kilos of 
cocaine, he was called Guillermo Rojas Ferro. He directed the 
operation from the prison in Vridslose, where he also hired a 
few of his couriers. 
  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE learned that he consistently called 
himself "Gustavo," and both his fellow prisoners and the members 
of the gang know him as "Gestapo." He refuses to talk to the 
police about the charges in what is up to now Denmark's largest 
cocaine case involving smuggling into the country in bowling 
balls, computer monitors, and hollowed-out books and ropes. A 
34-year-old Chilean-born woman was also arrested yesterday, 
charged with having brought messages to and from the prison 
while a 27-year-old man was being released. Twelve persons have 
now been arrested in the case, which would hardly have gotten 
this far if Ferro had not been able to communicate so freely in 
a Danish prison. 
  Narcotics Chief Erik Bjorn has no patent solution for the 
problem. But about the struggle against narcotics he says: "It 
is time for a debate on the failed narcotics policy. We work to 
catch as many drug dealers and smugglers as possible. The 
country must make a collective preventative effort, among other 
things, by working in schools and clubs to prevent young people 
from becoming drug addicts. And then the treatment system must 
take over the present addicts. They must be transferred so that 
they will immediately get effective treatment. If this happens, 
then I think that with everyone's help we can stop the abuse and 
the extensive resulting crime."

<F P=106> [Article: "Prisons Get Drug-Free Areas"] </F>
  [Text] The Ringe national prison in Fyn opened a section 
yesterday, the first in Denmark, in which young imprisoned drug 
addicts are offered a guaranteed drug-free environment. In a 
month, the Nyborg national prison will open a similar section. 
Both sections will have room for 12 addicts. 
  "The idea is to help the drug addicts who want to break the 
habit. When they are separated from the other prisoners, they 
avoid stress and offers of drugs or demands and threats to pay 
old drug debts. And they receive help in remaining drug-free," 
Prison Inspector Bodil Phillip of Ringe said. 
  The drug-free sections are so-called contract sections. The 
prisoners sign a contract that they will neither take nor deal 
in drugs. The contract has no legal value, only a moral one. 
Nevertheless, Prison Inspector K. Taagegaard of Nyborg thinks 
that the contract will reduce the abuse of drugs. "This is shown 
by experience from Norway and Sweden, which already have 
drug-free sections," he said. 
  About 90 percent of the prisoners in Ringe were drug abusers 
before they were imprisoned.

<F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Amphetamine Confiscations </F>
Continue to Increase in 1993"] 
  [Text] Almost 120 kg of hashish was seized last year. 
  Amphetamine seizures increased significantly last year, 
compared to the year before. The number of drug seizures has 
continued to increase strongly over a period of many years. In 
1993, the police and customs seized a total of 18.7 kg of 
amphetamines, while the amount seized the previous year, was 
11.5 kg. 
  The increase in hashish seizures also continued its upward 
trend in 1993, after dipping the year before. 
<H5>  Drug Rings Becoming Professional </H5>
  Hashish is still the most common drug, and more than 117 kg 
of it was seized. Almost half of that amount was seized by the 
Helsinki Narcotics Bureau, during the investigation of a major 
hashish case. 
  Last year, less heroin was seized than a year before. The 
reason for this is that, in 1992, two significant heroin 
shipments, which were not intended for the Finnish market, were 
seized from couriers arriving from Africa. 
  According to Bureau Chief Antti Turkama of the Central 
Criminal Police, the drug rings have clearly become more 
professional. 
  Previously, the drug smugglers and dealers were, almost 
without exception, drug users themselves, but during the last 
few years, economic gain has become almost the exclusive motive 
behind the drug trade. 
  Particularly, the dealers of hard drugs, mainly amphetamines 
and heroin, are professionals. 
<H5>  "Collection of Debts Has Become More Violent" </H5>
  In Turkama's view, this structural change has caused 
criminal 
enforcement methods to become harsher. The rings are carefully 
guarding their territories and their revenues, and the 
collection of debts has clearly become more violent, he 
explained. 
  Assistant Professor Erkki Vuori from the Institute of 
Forensic Medicine, has noted the same trend. During the latter 
part of the 1980's, no drug users were found among homicide 
victims, but during the last three years, the number of such 
victims has fluctuated between five and eight. 
  According to Vuori, the bodies of homicide victims who were 
drug users, are often severely beaten. 
  "It seems that this is based on some kind of private debt 
collection arrangement," he conjectured. 
  The drug problem is still most prevalent in and around the 
capital, as well as in other areas of the province of Uusimaa. 
However, based on available statistics, drugs are rapidly 
reaching other parts of the country. 
  The bulk of narcotics reaching Finland is still brought from 
traditional drug areas, such as Holland and Denmark. However, 
the drug flow from the east, or, in other words from Russia and 
Estonia, continues to grow.

<F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Appeals Court Reduced </F>
Sentences of Amphetamine Gang Members"] 
  [Text] The Helsinki Court of Appeals has reduced the 
sentences of several individuals convicted of involvement in an 
amphetamines gang. The gang on three separate occasions during 
the period May-August 1992 brought a total amount of 32 kg of 
the drugs into Finland. 
  Sentences for the two brothers thought to be the ringleaders 
were not changed. Vanta resident and salesman Raine Bruno 
Tienhaara, 35, was sentenced to 10 years, and Helsinki auto 
salesman Raimo Anthoni Tienhaara, 36, was sentenced to nine and 
a half years in prison. 
  A courier on two of the smuggling trips, salesman Eki 
Petteri 
Sosunov, 24, had his sentence reduced to a seven-year prison 
term. The Helsinki Municipal Court had originally given him a 
sentence of two years longer. The Appeals Court based the 
sentence reduction on the fact that Sosunov had cooperated with 
authorities in solving the case. 
  Sentences of two others convicted in the case were reduced 
to 
about one year. Helsinki motorcycle mechanic Risto Yrjo Tapio 
Haverinen, 29, had his sentence reduced to six years, and 
Helsinki offset printer Harri Marko Juhani Lihtavuo, 27, had his 
reduced to six and a half years. 
<H5>  Sentences "Too Severe" </H5>
  The Court of Appeals did not explain the reduced sentences 
for Haverinen and Lihtavuo, except by stating that their 
sentences "are considered too severe." Sentences of the others 
remained unchanged. 
  The Court of Appeals excused the convicted from paying 
compensation to the state based on the drug value, since the 
narcotics code regarding this has been changed. According to a 
new law that came into force at the start of this year, the drug 
value no longer has to be paid to the state. 
  The municipal court had ordered the Tiehaara brothers to pay 
some 1.3 million markkas, with smaller compensation amounts to 
be paid by the others. 
  Some of those involved in this case were also convicted in a 
related case involving bombings of a tax office. Sosunov, who 
participated in this in separate incidents in October 1991 and 
March 1992, received the most severe sentence. The government 
prosecutor eventually gave up his attempt to convict Raimo 
Tienhaara on incitement charges.

<F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Pilot Who Brought in </F>
Amphetamines Got Six Years Imprisonment"] 
  [Text] The pilot who smuggled in a 4 kg package of 
amphetamines was sentenced in Helsinki Circuit Court to six 
years in prison. Three other men with him in the rented small 
plane were given suspended prison sentences. 
  The 29-year-old Helsinki pilot Hannu Soppela in August 1993 
brought 4 kg of amphetamines from Estonia to Helsinki's Malm 
Airport. He had arranged with a couple of other men to bring in 
the substance. The case involving these is still not completed. 
  Soppela received 1 kg of amphetamines as pay for his courier 
trip, and he further distributed this amount. Some 140 grams was 
confiscated from him. In connection with further investigation a 
total of around 1.2 kg were seized. 
  The court took into account as a mitigating factor that 
Soppela had cooperated with authorities in solving the case. 
  A 30-year-old Riihimaki pilot who had been along as a 
courier 
received a suspended prison sentence of two years. That pilot 
denied the guilt during the entire trial, saying he did not know 
that the smuggled substance was amphetamines. He claimed he 
understood that they were bringing hormones from Estonia. 
  In the opinion of the court, the flyer understood at least 
when he was in Tallinn that amphetamines were involved. 
According to Soppela, he had shown the substance to the other 
pilot before the trip home. He and Soppela had together planned 
concealing the amphetamines in the body of the airplane. 
  The court gave two other men suspended prison sentences for 
complicity in a felony narcotics crime. A 31-year-old Helsinki 
fireman received a term of one year and nine months, and a 
29-year-old Helsinki porter one year and six months.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Drug squads recently seized 6.3 
tonnes of marijuana and 57 kg of cocaine in two operations in 
the port of Hamburg. This was reported by the customs 
authorities on Monday. The actions took place as early as in 
November 1993 and last January, but they were reported later for 
tactical reasons. 
  The customs officers discovered the marijuana in containers 
from the west African port of Warri (Nigeria) that were supposed 
to contain ginger and nut oil. Instead, the drug squad found 
almost 100 barrels with small, pressed marijuana packets. 
  The two containers were originally destined for Riga and 
Warsaw. The container with the destination Warsaw was not picked 
up in the port of Hamburg. The other container with the 
destination Riga was shipped to Latvia, but the actual 
addressees did not turn up there either. 
  The investigators found out about the cocaine delivery 
through a tip from abroad. As a result, they checked a 
container from Ecuador that had arrived on a Chinese ship. It 
contained 29 barrels with liquid polyester resin and was to be 
taken to Morocco. With the help of an x-ray vehicle [roentgen 
fahrzeug], the investigators discovered metal containers with 
two packets of cocaine each under the lids of the barrels.

<F P=106> [Article: "Customs' Seizures as Low as 4 Percent, Claims </F>
Study"] 
  [Text] As little as 4 per cent of the heroin smuggled into 
Britain is being seized, according to a survey published today 
which challenges the 10 to 30 per cent figure claimed by Customs 
and Excise, writes Duncan Campbell. 
  A report by the Centre for Health Economics at York 
University suggests that the cost-effectiveness of drug 
enforcement has been deteriorating since 1985. It argues there 
is a lack of accountability among enforcement agencies. 
  In their study, Trends on the Cost Effectiveness of 
Enforcement Activity, Professor Alan Maynard and research fellow 
Matthew Sutton say the annual publication of the amount of 
illicit drugs seized by Customs and police is traditionally 
accompanied by concern pressed about the growing problem. The 
authors argue there is no basis for claims that drug traffickers 
are being successfully tackled. 
  Customs and Excise have traditionally suggested that they 
seize roughly 10 per cent of all drugs imported and possibly as 
much as 20 per cent. The survey disagrees: "Based on annual 
figures, Customs rarely achieved the 10 per cent rate." 
  In 1987 and 1988, the study suggests that a more accurate 
figure would be 4 per cent. The estimates are possible for 
heroin because there are Home Office figures on heroin use but 
not for other drugs. 
  The budget of approximately &pound;335 million in the last 
financial year is divided equally between police and Customs. 
The level of spending increased by 74 per cent for the police 
and 38 per cent for Customs over the period 1979-89 but, says 
the study, were not matched by equivalent increases in impact on 
the heroin market. 
  The study adds: "The light grip which the police had on the 
domestic heroin market declined after 1985." 
  The authors suggest that there is an overall picture of 
decreasing cost-effectiveness. "The lack of accountability for 
the significant increases in public funding enjoyed by drug 
enforcement agencies during the 1980s is surprising, 
particularly in a period when the dominant political rhetoric 
emphasised `value for money.'"

Activity in the Illicit Heroin Market, 1979-1990; Matthew Sutton

  [Text] A police informer who has helped to jail some of the 
major drug smugglers and dealers in Britain over the past five 
years claims that he has frequently encouraged people to take 
part in drug deals that would never have happened without his 
participation. 
  He claims to have made tens of thousands of pounds from 
informants' funds while carrying on selling drugs himself. 
  His story highlights the grey area between police attempts 
to 
arrest those already dealing in drugs and the way crimes can 
come to be committed which might not otherwise have happened at 
all. 
  The informer is known to police by the code-name of Peter 
Poacher and his informer's number is 176. His real name is Nigel 
and he has worked under the names of Danny and John. THE 
GUARDIAN is not publishing his last name because it is an 
uncommon one and he fears reprisals against his parents, who 
live in the North of England. 
  He is being sought by associates of people on whom he has 
informed and by lawyers acting for people he has entrapped. His 
revelations could lead to the reopening of cases of prisoners 
who claimed he was the main participant in drugs deals for which 
they were jailed. 
  Nigel, now aged 26, became an informer after being arrested 
on a drugs charge five years ago. Since then he has worked 
extensively for the police. 
  The rewards have been substantial--totalling, he claims, 
more 
than &pound;35,000. He says he received the highest ever reward 
from the Number 3 Regional Crime Squad, based in Wakefield, with 
a payment of &pound;11,500 for arrest of an LSD smuggler. He says 
he has made tens of thousands of pounds from drug dealing 
activities. 
  Nigel, from Ormskirk, is the adopted son of a policeman and 
was introduced to drugs in Amsterdam. 
  About five years ago, police investigating a stolen car with 
which he was involved raided his then home in Lincoln and found 
drugs. He offered to become an informer. "I gave them 
everything," he says. 
  He claims he set up a flourishing amphetamine trade in 
Newmarket and received money both from drug dealing and in 
rewards from the Community Action Trust, the Home Office's 
international fund, and the police. 
  Nigel also claims that he supplied the recipe for an 
amphetamines factory. He says that as a result of his activities 
more drugs become available on the streets as small-time dealers 
build up towards big deals. 
  Detective Chief Inspector Geoff Cole, of Number 3 RCS, said: 
"We never comment on individual informants." He added: "It is 
standard practice that officers dealing with informants are 
constantly alive to the issue of agents provocateurs. If we had 
any reason to suspect that an informant was acting in such a 
role, we would terminate the operation and the informant would 
be liable to prosecution." 
  Nigel is now no longer assisting the police and is planning 
to move abroad. 
  Last night, John Wadham, legal officer for Liberty, said 
that 
agents provocateurs were "part of the problem, not part of the 
solution."

  [Text] Ankara, 1 April -- The talks between Russian and 
Turkish Interior Ministers Viktor Yerin and Nahit Mentese 
yesterday ended in Ankara by signing a joint protocol. 
  The sides confirmed their agreement and resoluteness to 
develop cooperation between the two countries in the fight 
against international terrorism and drug smuggling. During the 
talks the decision was taken to hold a meeting of the joint 
commission in the very near future with the aim of stepping up 
mutual actions in the security field. 
  Speaking at the protocol signing ceremony, Mentese said 
strengthening cooperation between Turkey and Russia on the basis 
of friendship and unity of interests would be for the benefit of 
both states. 
  The Russian and Turkish Interior Ministries, Yerin said in 
his turn, agreed to coordinate actions in the fight against 
organized crime. According to the Russian minister, special 
attention was given to drugs and arms smuggling. 
  It is expected that the Russian delegation will leave Turkey 
today.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- The number of detectives 
dealing with drug-related crimes has been recently dwindling in 
the process of reorganisation of district interior departments, 
while the rate of these crimes is rapidly increasing, according 
to Vladimir Khayretdinov, head of department for fighting 
illegal drug-trafficking. 
  Addressing a news conference on Wednesday, he reported that 
a 
total of 141 drug cases were being investigated at the moment, 
as compared with 993 drug-related crimes registered in 1992 and 
2,183 crimes registered last year. 
  The interior officer listed Ukraine and Asian regions as the 
main transshipment points on the way of drugs to Moscow. 
Non-traditional types of narcotics are smuggled from Latin 
America, while Germany supplies crack and heroin. One gram of 
quality hashish trades for 100,000 roubles on the black market, 
the same as one glass of dried poppy, one gram of heroin costs 
150 U.S. dollars. High prices force drug-addicts to commit 
grave crimes in order to pay for dope. 
  Khayretdinov stressed the need for setting up a centre to 
fight drug-trafficking, with the participation of experts in 
different fields. The first step in this direction has already 
been taken: an orphanage for children addicted to drugs is now 
functioning in Moscow's Cheremushki district. Another orphanage 
is to be opened in the south-eastern municipal district.

Swoop"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- A preventive operation code-named 
"Signal 2," in which personnel of the Internal Affairs 
Directorates of Murmansk, Kaliningrad, Pskov, Smolensk, 
Arkhangelsk and other oblasts of Russia and the Republic of 
Karelia took part, has ended in St. Petersburg City and oblast. 
  A simultaneous investigation of all zones and scenes of 
crime--stations, markets, hotels, warehouses, and parking 
lots--was carried out for the first time. A 500-strong 
motorized infantry regiment of internal troops and a 300-strong 
motorized militia detachment were involved in the operation. 
Checks and controls on railroads and highways leading to 
Moscow, Pskov, Novgorod, and Murmansk were stepped up. People 
worked 12-hour shifts without leave during the operation. 
  The results in brief are that more than 3,500 crimes were 
detected, including 43 murders, around 300 robberies, and more 
than 200 thefts and cases of taking away of vehicles. A huge 
number of firearms and edged weapons, around 40 kg of drugs, and 
money and valuables worth 718 million rubles and $29,000 were 
seized from criminals. The level of crime halved in St 
Petersburg City and oblast during the two weeks of the operation.

<F P=106> [Article by Kh. Ordukhanova: "An Invitation to Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] A "round table" was held the other day at the 
Internal Affairs Ministry of Azerbaijan, on problems of the 
struggle with drug addiction and the drug business. Today 
BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY invites the readers' attention to the 
statements of its participants. Azerbaijan Internal Affairs 
Minister Vagif Novruzov opened the meeting: 
  In recent times an increase in drug addiction, drug business 
and the crime which thrives on that soil has been observed 
throughout the world. This has to be alarming to the government 
of any country. The UN has drawn up a Worldwide Program of 
Actions for International Cooperation in the Struggle with the 
Illegal Production and Distribution of Narcotic Substances. 
Azerbaijan too has joined in this struggle. But the narcotics 
situation in the republic has become much more complex. 
Specialists affirm that if decisive measures are not taken, 
tomorrow it may be too late. 
  There are a number of reasons for the worsening narcotics 
situation in the republic. These include the increasing 
complexity of the operational situation connected with the start 
of the economic reforms; the decline in the people's standard of 
living; and the opening of the borders, which aids the expansion 
of the scope of the drug business. And the prerequisites exist 
for the development of the drug business in the republic as 
well--practically every region has its own raw-material base, 
and the appropriate climate. The drug business is an adaptable 
one, and the dealers have begun to re-organize their operations 
to make use of such channels, and to adopt methods which they 
did not even dream of two years ago. Azerbaijan is becoming a 
trans-shipment point for the transfer of narcotics from Asia to 
Europe and the other way around. One group was arrested with 
1,387 kg of morphine. They were following the 
Afghanistan-Turkmenistan-Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey route and 
were arrested at the Sarpi border post on the Turkish border! At 
present, synthetic drugs are enjoying great "demand." Whereas, 
for example, a gram of hashish is enough for one cigarette, from 
one gram of morphine one can make 100 doses of solution for 
injection. One gram of trimethylphentanil makes one thousand 
doses for injection, and this drug is 5,500 times more powerful 
than morphine. 
  While starting new airlines and developing transport ties 
with foreign countries, which of course is laudable, one should, 
in my view, also develop a clear-cut system for combatting the 
penetration of drug dealers into the republic. I understand that 
the lion's share of the work falls to the MVD structure, and we 
are doing our job; nevertheless, this path is strewn with many 
difficulties. Suffice it to say that one has to work under 
extreme conditions, and that the employees in the MVD 
Administrations do not have the reliable and all-encompassing 
social and legal protection which the current situation demands. 
  Chief of the Administration for Combatting Drug 
Addiction and the Drug Business, Adalyat Ibragimov: 
  The number of detected crimes in the drug business realm has 
noticeably increased. Whereas, for example, in 1992, 1,305 
crimes were registered under Articles 225, 226, 226-1, 226-2, 
226-3, 226-4, 226-5, 226-6 and 227 of the Criminal Code of the 
Azerbaijan Republic, in 1993, 1,755 criminal cases were brought 
under these same articles. Approximately 740 kg of various 
narcotic substances were confiscated from the criminals, as well 
as hundreds of kilograms of raw narcotic plant materials, 
weapons, and R10 million in counterfeit currency. Criminal 
proceedings were instituted against 13 citizens of the IRI 
[Islamic Republic of Iran], and 81 from CIS countries. 
  On 25 November 1993, IRI citizens Farzad Shafi and Mashallah 
Shafi were arrested in Baku, as they were attempting to sell 850 
grams of a narcotic substance (Tiryak). 
  On 30 November 1993, other citizens of the IRI were arrested 
in Baku: Dzhafar Garakhanly Safar, who was trying to sell a 
large amount of narcotics (raw opium); and Khalili Gysymlu 
Nursret, Shekh Imampur Veli, Siyavushani Mekhti Ali, and Amir 
Guseyn Khagigat Pilavar Akhmed, who were trying to sell 685 
grams of a narcotic substance (raw opium) for R1,300,000; and so 
on. 
  Just a few days ago we completed an operation for the arrest 
of a native of Fizuli, A. Alyshev, who was in possession of 
nearly a kilogram of raw opium, the black-market price of which 
would amount to R20 million. 
  Last year 3,994 drug addicts were registered, among whom 
were 
268 women and 36 juveniles. We have carried out Operation 
"Hash-Hash-93", during which drug-enforcement agents in 26 
rayons of Azerbaijan instituted criminal proceedings on 41 
counts of growing illegal narcotics-bearing plants. 
  We are now introducing a unified automated system--a "data 
bank"--by means of which we will be able to exchange information 
and operational data about drug dealers, trans-shippers and 
other persons occupied in the drug business. The system permits 
establishing a legal mechanism for the control of joint 
operations, and to prevent the commission of crimes in this 
sphere. We are about to conduct meetings with our Turkish and 
Iranian colleagues, at which we plan to work out a mechanism for 
joint operations. 
  I must note that we meet more frequently with 
representatives 
of our neighboring states than with our colleagues from other 
law-enforcement organs and services. We do not have a single 
coordinating center in the struggle with the "white death." We 
often have to act at our own peril and risk, and do not sense 
the aid of the public. I would think that the conclusions of our 
"round table" will not allow anyone to remain indifferent to the 
inevitable fate of thousands and thousands of citizens of our 
republic. 
  Chief Physician of the Republic Narcological Clinic 
System, Azhif Abdullayev: 
  Drug addiction has not yet reached a threatening level in 
our 
republic, but medicine is already experiencing serious 
difficulties even with the number of patients we already have. 
  It is no secret that drug addiction is a serious and 
dangerous disease, to which a person subjects himself 
voluntarily. But drug addiction is also a crime, for narcotic 
substances are not freely available for sale, and the 
acquisition, use, storage and transmission to other persons 
comprise all the elements of a crime. The very worst thing is 
that the ranks of drug addiction are being filled at the expense 
of our youth. The reasons are many: curiosity, a strong desire 
for acute sensations, and the lack of complete information on 
the consequences of using narcotics. Unfortunately, certain 
young people are under the dangerous misconception that they can 
discontinue their use of drugs at any time, if they want to. But 
from the very first injection of opium or the first drag of 
hashish, a person finds himself in the trap of the "white 
death"--from which it is almost impossible to escape, and 
treatment does not always produce the expected effect. Death at 
a young age (frequently--suicide or purposeful overdose), 
psychiatric disorders, and birth defects in one's offspring--are 
a tragedy for ones relatives and dear ones; these misfortunes 
await everyone who falls to the temptation. Statistics show that 
in his short life, every drug addict draws up to six other 
people into his "circle." The experience of our narcological 
service shows that a drug addict either turns to crime, or 
suffers withdrawal symptoms, or takes an excessive dose. The 
costs of narcotics are continually increasing, and that means 
their use is growing and expanding as well. The drug business is 
a very profitable one, and of the tens of thousands of people 
crossing our borders, some are attracted to the drug business in 
order to improve their own financial situation. 
  We are particularly delinquent in taking preventive 
measures. 
In my opinion, everyone should be involved in prevention, and 
that is why I am delighted to come to today's meeting. I believe 
that propaganda plays a very useful role at any level--in 
elementary school, at the institute, and in the mass information 
media--and that it will bring the appropriate returns. 
  The time has come for physicians, jurists and social 
organizations to take action, such that every person who wants 
to "get high" would realize and understand the consequences of 
his habit, which is ruinous and fatal for both himself and for 
those around him. As a rule, it takes some time from the day he 
takes his first puff or his first needle until the day he 
becomes an addict, and during all this time he is not in a 
vacuum or in isolation. Frequently this takes place in the eyes 
of his parents, teachers or fellow-workers. 
  Hospital treatment of drug addicts is also one of the 
problems facing the republic health care system. I must report 
with bitterness that the republic lacks the materials, medicines 
and modern equipment to diagnose drug addiction. We do not even 
have the diagnostic tools or centers [diagnostikum]. In western 
countries all policemen and narcotics experts have them. With 
their help one can instantly determine the presence of narcotics 
in the body. We also lack a rehabilitation system for those who 
have undergone treatment, and as a result of remission, 
treatment does not make sense. 
  The fact of the matter is, that nearly all organizations 
involved in the prevention of this terrible disease are 
displaying amazing passivity, and are leaving everything to the 
narcotics experts and to officers of the law-enforcement organs. 
But our experience, and the experience of other countries, shows 
that treatment, and social and medical rehabilitation of those 
suffering from drug addiction, can succeed only when all the 
interested organizations take up the cause in a cooperative 
manner and work out a clear-cut system for joint actions. 
  President of the Azerbaijan International Association 
for Combatting Drug Addiction and the Drug Business Kyamil 
Mamedov: 
  Our association was established by the republic Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and Ministry of Health; we work in direct 
contact with the Administration for Combatting Drug Addiction 
and the Drug Business. The association was established for 
cooperation in combatting drug addiction and the drug business, 
and for prevention of the crime spawned by drug addiction. We 
are striving to do everything possible in order to carry out, 
without delay, a complex program of projects for preventing drug 
addiction, for identifying those suffering from addiction, and 
for their social rehabilitation. Adalyat Ibragimov depicted the 
narcotics situation in the republic, and, as you can see, it is 
quite alarming. The continuing analysis and forecasting of the 
situation which we are conducting with the administration, are 
not providing encouraging results. One thing is 
clear--attempting to combat the "white death" one at a time, and 
trying to prevent it through the efforts of the law enforcement 
organs and Health Ministry alone, is impossible. The combined 
efforts of the state and social organizations are required; and 
our association can, I believe, do a great deal in this plane. 
And here it is not a matter of the amount of confiscated 
narcotic substances or the number of dealers from the narcomafia 
arrested. It is important that every individual case raises an 
alarm both among those invested with power, and among the 
ordinary citizens, summoning them to decisive actions. 
  I have been working in the internal affairs system for 
thirty 
years, starting as a young officer and reaching the post of 
deputy minister of the MVD; I have supervised the criminal 
services and am accustomed to operational actions. When I agreed 
to head the association, I immediately got down to specific 
operations. We have met with the ambassadors of the USA, Great 
Britain, Israel, France, Turkey, Iran and others; and with the 
UN Representative in Azerbaijan, and presented proposals for 
cooperation in accordance with the requirements of the [UN] 
Convention. It is my great pleasure to report that all of them 
readily responded to our proposal, in spite of the short notice, 
and we have already received concrete replies from them. The 
Association has received a letter from T. Young, Great Britain's 
ambassador in Azerbaijan, in which he offered his assistance: he 
has forwarded a package containing documents from state and 
private organizations in Britain occupied with the problems of 
drug addiction. I believe that they can be a great help to us in 
our work. Why re-invent the wheel? For example, in the near 
future, based on the experience of our English colleagues, we 
will be establishing an anonymous "telephone hotline" for 
persons suffering from drug addiction and their relatives. 
Phillip Remler, a representative of the American Embassy, and 
Joseph Shepperd, an officer of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration, visited the Association. We reached agreement, 
that very soon specialists from the agency will come to 
Azerbaijan to conduct a cycle of classes on the facilities of 
the republic police academy, for raising the skills of 
Azerbaijanian policemen engaged in combatting drug addiction and 
the drug business. Incidentally, the administration and the 
association, together with the Azerbaijan Police Academy, are 
even now re-training their cadres. Israel's diplomatic mission 
in Azerbaijan is preparing for the departure of a group of 
republic police, medical and customs officials for the purpose 
of establishing contacts and exchange of work experiences. Mr. 
Eleizer Jotvat, ad interim Israeli Charge d'Affairs in 
Azerbaijan, informed us of this. 
  We have taken part in three international conferences on 
problems of preventing and combatting drug addiction and the 
drug business--in Belarus, Pakistan and Iran. 
  At a session of the EKO [Economic Cooperation Organization] 
Regional Planning Council in Tehran in January of this year, 
along with other questions, our proposal on establishing 
associations such as ours in the all EKO member states was 
examined. In our view, this is a successful form of association 
for state and social organizations which are not dependent upon 
one another. Our proposal was adopted. It was decided to include 
it in the agenda of the next session of the EKO Committee on 
Combatting Drug Addiction and the Drug Business. 
  In order to attract attention and to ensure the 
participation 
of the state structures and social organizations in the struggle 
with drug addiction and the drug business, we have appealed to 
the heads of the ministries, departments and social 
organizations, on which to a considerable degree the fate of the 
solution of this problem depends. They fully appreciated our 
proposal, and gave their consent to combine efforts within the 
framework of the association. We have received replies from the 
Ministry of Education, the republic customs committee, the 
Academy of Science, the Administration of Caucasian Muslims, the 
Trade-Union Confederation, the Committee on Physical Culture and 
Sport, the Youth League, the Health and Welfare Fund, the 
"Vakinets" Association, the Childrens' Fund, the Sobriety and 
Health Societies, the "Znanie" Society, and the independent 
telecommunication company, BMTI. In their replies, they 
expressed readiness to combine efforts in combatting drug 
addiction, and offered concrete proposals. 
  Azerbaijan Republic Internal Affairs Minister Vagif 
Novruzov: 
  I approve of the idea heard at the round table on the 
necessity for multiplying our efforts in combatting drug 
addiction and the drug business. The time has come to resolve 
this question at the state level, and with the participation of 
social organizations; today we need a systemic approach to 
solution of the problems facing us. 
  Until recently it was thought that we had no problem of drug 
addiction and drug business, and owing to such a comfortable 
"perception," problems piled up, and grew like a snowdrift. And 
incidentally, drug addiction, as a social evil, has greater 
influence than any other factor on the commission of especially 
vicious crimes, undermines the social foundation, and has a 
negative effect on the nation's gene pool. The time has come to 
declare war on this terrible disease, and thereby bring about 
its defeat. 
  The National Assembly of Azerbaijan has adopted a resolution 
on joining the the United Nations Convention on Combatting the 
Illegal Circulation of Narcotic Substances and Psychotropic 
Materials of 1988. The leadership has put this resolution into 
action. We are now preparing documents which meet international 
requirements, and we are seeking ways for solving questions on 
carrying out the conditions of the convention and on making use 
of the rights it has conferred on us. 
  One year ago, the republic Cabinet of Ministers adopted a 
national program for combatting drug addiction and the drug 
business. It stipulated a complex of organizational, legal, 
preventive and other measures. Unfortunately, as of this day 
neither a mechanism, nor a system, nor practical implementation 
has been worked out. 
  Suffice it to say that we are still operating on the basis 
of 
many obsolete normative acts. The National Assembly must, in the 
near future, adopt new legislative acts, and re-examine the 
status of the units carrying on the struggle with drug addiction 
and the drug business. The struggle with this evil envisions 
employing a complex of law-enforcement and preventive measures. 
The internal affairs organs, the procuracy, the customs 
committee and the Ministry of National Security are carrying out 
a defensive operation to preclude the shipment of narcotic 
substances into the republic, and the use of the country as a 
trans-shipment point. The other day our Kazakh colleagues sent 
us a draft of an intergovernmental agreement, to be signed by 
the governments of Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, 
entitled "On Cooperation in the Struggle with the Unlawful 
Circulation of Narcotic Substances and Psychotropic Materials." 
They have introduced this same propsal for the examination of 
the EKO. I believe that our government will give its consent to 
concluding such an agreement. And we have introduced our own 
proposals to the republic Cabinet of Ministers. Having received 
a reply from them, we have sent our own representatives and 
experts to Kazakhstan, and we are introducing our own proposals 
and amendments; and we are preparing a document for signature at 
a high level. We intend to implement contacts of this sort with 
the countries belonging to EKO and with other countries, in the 
area of combatting drug addiction and the drug business. 
International cooperation in this area is taking place at a high 
level; however, within the republic there are still many 
unresolved problems, one of which is--the creation of a powerful 
material and financial base. 
  One could also wish for better preventive measures. We have 
no hospitals for treatment of drug addicts and no rehabilitation 
points for them; television and the press are avoiding the 
problem, and there is no counter-propaganda in the schools and 
institutes. The International Association is taking the first 
steps in uniting the state and social structures. Enough has 
been said on everything here, and I have only to introduce one 
more proposal. 
  Yes, it is impossible to combat drug addiction and the drug 
business by oneself. And I propose getting together in the near 
future, discussing our common problems, and this time adopting 
urgent measures. I express my gratitude to those ministries, 
departments, and social organizations who have readily agreed to 
combine efforts with us in this noble work, which is so 
necessary for our nation today. Today's conversation is an 
invitation to dialogue, in which not only the organizations of 
which I was speaking can take part, but also all interested 
citizens in the republic. 
  Today's meeting will become a stimulus to a solution of our 
problems, and the next one--a lever, and leadership for action.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek, 31 March -- Kyrgyzstan has become the first 
Central Asian country allocated funds from the UN International 
Narcotics Control program. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Zelichenko, chairman of the 
State Commission for Narcotics Control, said today that $450,000 
were allocated for the 1994-95 period. They will be used for 
providing equipment for sub-units engaged in fighting drug 
trafficking and for training specialists. 
  Zelichenko claimed that international organizations are not 
only giving a fitting assessment of the Kyrgyz anti-drug 
services, but have also outlined a number of measures that will 
permit the republic to become integrated in the worldwide 
struggle against drug dealers. 
  Today this is necessary: via Gornyy Badakhshan and 
Kyrgyzstan 
drugs from Afghanistan have started spreading across the CIS 
republics. Via Russia, Afghan opium and marijuana wind up in 
Western Europe. This year Kyrgyzstan will be able to reach the 
Kara-Korum highway via China, which will enable Kyrgyz freight 
to get to the coast of the Indian Ocean, into India, Pakistan, 
and other countries of this region. But specialists claim that, 
together with economic advantages, the republic will become the 
object of drug dealers' close attention. Using the new route, 
they will be able to transport narcotics in both 
directions--into Asia and into Europe. It is this which is 
compelling Kyrgyzstan's law enforcement bodies to attach special 
importance to stepping up the fight against drug trafficking.

plants. When members of the Federal Police arrived, the camp

  [Text] A bilateral antidrug agreement for cooperation 
between Cuba and Argentina was signed this afternoon at the 
Foreign Ministry. The agreement was signed by Cuban Justice 
Minister Carlos Amat and by Argentine Secretary of State [title 
as heard] Alberto Lestelle. 
  Lestelle told the press that this agreement will trigger the 
development of relations between the two countries within a very 
short term. Lestelle said: 
  [Begin recording] The signing of this agreement implies, 
first of all, something very significant for the two countries. 
This agreement is extended far beyond the regions, far beyond 
government decisions, and far beyond other problems. It will 
become the main gate between Argentina and Cuba for the 
treatment of other problems, which perhaps could be even more 
important than the drug issue. 
  During a week of work in the areas of health, education, and 
the police, each group will meet independently and will prepare 
a program. This program will determine how we will be able to 
provide assistance to Cuba, and how Cuba can provide us with 
assistance as well. We are going to analyze this further on a 
later date, but I also think that Argentine Health Ministry 
officials must visit Cuba to see the development of the family 
doctor program. 
  In Argentina we have only a brief sketch of this, nothing 
else. By virtue of these meetings, we must establish what we can 
do here and what you can do in Argentina. So this possibility 
must remain open. [end recording] 
  I wish to add that Dr. Lestelle is heading an Argentine 
delegation that has been visiting Cuba for several days, seeking 
the signing of this cooperation agreement for the antidrug 
fight. I would also like to tell our listeners that Cuba is a 
signatory of the UN convention for the fight against 
international drug trafficking, and has agreed to sign bilateral 
agreements with many countries of the region.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Argentina and Cuba signed 
an agreement in Havana on 5 April that contemplates mutual 
bilateral assistance for the repression of drug trafficking, the 
prevention of drug addiction, and an exchange of information 
between security organizations. 
  The document was signed by Cuban Justice Minister Carlos 
Amat 
and Argentina's Secretary of State Alberto Lestelle. 
  Lestelle said Cuba "has important traffic by large (drug) 
producers in the south and important traffic by large consumers 
in the north." 
  The island "still does not have consumption problems but is 
facing an incipient trafficking problem," the secretary added. 
  Cuban Justice Vice Minister Zenaida Osorio, who was 
mentioned 
by PRENSA LATINA, said: "The development of tourism and the 
opening of the country to foreign investors might also attract 
traffickers." 
  Secretary of State Lestelle, the highest ranking Argentine 
federal authority on the repression of trafficking and addiction 
prevention, after signing the agreement said the document will 
enable the exchange of information between specialized security 
organizations from the two countries. 
  For this work, Lestelle said Argentina uses the National 
Maritime Prefecture and the National Border Police. 
  Lestelle said that under the "mutual agreement," an ad-hoc 
committee has been created--its members will be appointed 
later--to define the way this information cooperation and 
exchange will operate. The agreement also covers social 
assistance and the legal aspects of trafficking repression and 
consumption prevention. 
  Lestelle said that in the Central American and Caribbean 
region, Argentina has similar cooperation agreements with Costa 
Rica, Dominican Republic, and Guatemala and similar proposals 
are being negotiated with Nicaragua and Honduras.

<F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Varela] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, 10 Apr (EFE) -- Fifteen days after 
acknowledging his wrongdoings, announcing his retirement from 
public life, and of being politically "crucified" as a result of 
alleged links to drug trafficking, former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora decided in the last few hours to break his 
silence and to defend himself. 
  On 26 March, in a televised address to the nation and 
flanked 
by a crucifix, former theology student Paz Zamora acknowledged 
"his mistakes, made in good faith" during his presidential 
administration (1989-1993). In addition, he announced his 
retirement from public life, and therefore, his decision to 
withdraw from running for president in the 1997 elections. 
  However, yesterday Paz Zamora formally requested to make a 
statement "as another citizen, without seeking protection in any 
privileges whatsoever," to the parliamentary commission that has 
proceeded to unmercifully question several fellow party members 
who occupied high-ranking positions during his administration. 
  According to Paz Zamora, his only "sin" that has been proven 
up to now is having cultivated a close and "naive" friendship 
with an alleged drug trafficker who goes by the name of Isaac, 
surnamed Chavarria, and alias "Oso," whose habit is to 
constantly bite and gently suck a rosary in public. 
  As result of that friendship, Paz Zamora's main apostles and 
several leading members of the Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left (MIR) were investigated and accused by the police of links 
with drug trafficking and cross-examined by a parliamentary 
commission. 
  All of the former public officials proceeded to defend 
themselves firmly and some of them, such as Susana Seleme, Paz 
Zamora's private secretary during his presidential term, even 
denied on more than three occasions being involved in anything. 
She even described herself as "the biggest victim of good faith 
mistakes" committed by the former president. 
  On the other hand, this past Friday the Bolivian Interior 
Ministry, apparently always well advised by the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA), indicated its lack of solid 
evidence in its accusations against the MIR during an appearance 
before the parliamentary investigation commission this past 
Friday. 
  During cross-examination by the parliamentary commission, 
General Renato Lopez, head of the Special Front in the Struggle 
Against Drug Trafficking (FELCN), and Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos, 
reluctantly admitted that their only evidence was based on 
unsubstantiated accusations made by confessed drug trafficker 
Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez, a former MIR activist arrested during 
Paz Zamora's administration and sentenced to 12 years in prison. 
  Lopez and Ramos even accepted the possibility that they may 
have to publicly apologize to some MIR members because some of 
the accusations that were mysteriously leaked to the media would 
now seem not to have any support whatsoever. 
  Nevertheless, up until today, most commentators and 
politicians in Bolivia agree in predicting the inevitable 
political demise of the MIR and its leader, Paz Zamora. 
  Parliamentary Investigation Commission President Edil 
Sandoval, has acknowledged Paz Zamora's request to be 
cross-examined and has announced that the former president could 
present his testimony this coming Tuesday. Based on the content 
of the letter sent to Sandoval, Paz Zamora insinuates that he 
would like to be cross-examined publicly in presence of the 
media, as his fellow party members have been. Their respective 
testimonies were broadcast daily and live by La Paz Radio 
Panamericana. 
  However, the members of the parliamentary commission 
summoned 
a meeting for this Monday to decide if the cross-examination 
will take place publicly or privately in honor of the former 
president's investiture, which would be contrary to Paz Zamora's 
request.

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 5 Apr (EFE) -- Susana Seleme, who was 
the private secretary of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, 
today said she was a "victim of the good faith errors" by the 
former president. Seleme said this while being questioned by a 
congressional commission investigating the former government's 
alleged links with drug trafficking. [passage omitted] 
  Seleme is among the group of militants of Paz Zamora's 
party, 
the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), charged with being 
involved with traffickers following a police investigation 
prompted by statements by trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka Meco. 
  The Bolivian Police investigation is centered on Paz 
Zamora's 
friendship with alleged drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso. 
  Seleme is charged with having protected alleged trafficker 
Edgar Fernandez Lazcano--who is regarded as Chavarria's 
aide--and of having accepted money from Chavarria to finance the 
MIR. 
  Paz Zamora's former secretary today denied having had a 
personal relationship with any of these individuals. 
  She admitted, however, having spoken over the phone to Meco 
Dominguez once and with Chavarria on several occasions when they 
unsuccessfully tried to contact, through her, Paz Zamora when he 
was president. 
  Seleme admitted that Paz Zamora and his family had a long 
standing friendship with Chavarria. She added that she thought 
Paz Zamora believed that the person who is now regarded as a 
trafficker was involved in strictly legal deals. 
  Seleme took advantage of the occasion to say that she 
believes the struggle against trafficking in Bolivia is a 
violation of human rights. 
  She recalled an attempt to abduct her a few weeks ago, 
apparently by police who mistakenly abducted her niece whom they 
interrogated for several hours. 
  She spoke of the charges, also being investigated by 
Congress, by several inmates charged with trafficking who said 
they had been brutally tortured in "clandestine strongholds" by 
alleged Bolivian and foreign police agents. 
  Seleme said the charges linking the MIR with trafficking are 
part of a "sinister plan" organized by "the first world power 
and its representation in Bolivia," referring to the United 
States and its embassy in La Paz. 
  "I deeply admire Bill Clinton (U.S. President) and (his 
wife) 
Hillary Clinton, but I do not think human rights should be 
violated to fight trafficking," said Seleme. 
  She added: "I am not a delinquent. I am willing to shoot 
myself to prove I am innocent." She also voiced her conviction 
that her party colleagues are also innocent.

<F P=106> [Article by Mabel Azcui] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Oscar Eid, leader of the 
party [Movement of the Revolutionary Left--MIR] of former 
Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora, denounced today illegal 
actions to incriminate him perpetrated by the antidrug police 
and the U.S. Embassy in La Paz. This occurred after he heard 
his recorded voice in a conversation with the alleged drug 
trafficker Edgar Fernandez who admits that the "situation is 
f......" ["situacion j......"] 
  Eid testified today for three and a half hours before the 
Constitutional Committee of the Chamber of Deputies that is 
investigating alleged links between the MIR leadership and Isaac 
"Oso" Chavarria who is considered by the Special Antinarcotics 
Force, FELCN, to be the top trafficker in the country. 
  Eid, who is Paz Zamora's right hand man, surprised the 
committee by indicating that he was summoned by "high officials 
of the U.S. Embassy" in La Paz who handed him a questionnaire of 
the FELCN regarding an alleged trip by Paz Zamora and Chavarria 
to Cuba, and on the whereabouts of Fernandez. 
  The committee members heard a tape recording of phone calls 
by Edgar Fernandez, Chavarria's aide, apparently late in 
February or early in March 1994 to Oscar Eid's house, and to the 
house of former President Paz Zamora in Tarija. 
  Fernandez, in a desperate voice asks Eid and his party for 
help "to disappear" before the police find him and make him 
appear before the Constitutional Committee because he was sure 
"I will be torn to pieces," in other words all his alibis would 
be discredited. 
  "Please Oscar, please help me," and "get Jaime (Paz Zamora) 
to tell me where to go" Fernandez was heard say in a pitiful 
tone. But in the face of Eid's evasive answer, Fernandez 
warned: "I have not said very much about you," adding "I will 
not continue to be f......" 
  Eid refused to help Fernandez, admitting "we don't know what 
to do" and then repeated: "f....., f....., we are all f......" 
  Eid very confidently confirmed before the committee that 
"those calls were made," adding that Paz Zamora told him that 
similar calls were received in El Picacho, Paz Zamora's ranch 
near Tarija. 
  Eid said that the existence of the recordings confirmed his 
fear that illegal methods were being used to incriminate people. 
  He told the committee: "This is not an accusation against 
the 
embassy" merely information to the deputies regarding his 
presence in the U.S. Embassy to answer a FELCN questionnaire. 
  Eid not only answered the FELCN questionnaire through the 
U.S. Embassy but also travelled to Tarija to obtain Paz Zamora's 
personal confirmation that "he definitely did not go to Cuba" 
with Chavarria. 
  During the three and a half hour interrogation, Eid admitted 
that Chavarria had provided small planes and a wagon during the 
MIR electoral campaign and that he went to Chavarria's farm to 
supervise the drafting of a communique regarding the 
"narco-photograph." 
  This photograph shows Chavarria and Paz Zamora sitting on 
the 
wing of a plane. It was published in 1988, when Bolivian 
politics were shaken by another "narco-scandal" that affected 
two other political parties (the Nationalist Democratic Action 
and the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement). The photograph was 
used to reach an agreement to can investigations into possible 
links between politicians and drug trafficking. [sentence as 
received] 
  The MIR leader asserted that, on Paz Zamora's instructions, 
he gave Fernandez $9,000 dollars from party funds to pay 
Chavarria's medical bills in La Paz. Franco added that he never 
accounted for this money to anybody but the former president.

  [Text] Fernando Cajias, a leader of the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left, MIR, has accused the U.S. Government of 
plotting to destroy social democracy--not just in Bolivia, but 
in the whole world. 
  [Begin Cajias recording] The point is that now the cold war 
is over and communism has fallen to pieces, social democracy is 
the only rival for the liberals. I believe there is an 
international plan to eliminate social democracy worldwide. [end 
recording] 
  As far as Bolivia is concerned, Cajias claimed the anti-MIR 
campaign linking his party to drug traffickers--which is being 
orchestrated by the current Bolivian Administration and the U.S. 
Embassy in Bolivia--has succeeded in removing from [former 
President] Jaime Paz Zamora his status as a national leader. 
  [Begin recording] [Cajias] As you probably know, a survey 
was 
done at the end of last year. It showed that Jaime Paz Zamora 
was regaining popularity. Thus, it was the right time to take 
advantage of circumstances and prevent this from happening. We 
are perfectly aware mistakes have been made, as the president of 
the party personally acknowledged. These mistakes have cost us 
dearly but we will not give up politics. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the MIR survive as it is or 
will 
it have to be reborn? 
  [Cajias] I believe this has thwarted many hopes, many people 
have ceased to believe in us, and even our militants are greatly 
demoralized. It would be worse, however, to abandon all our 
hopes. [end recording] 
  Asked about drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria's latest 
disclosures, Cajias answered that the next stage of the 
investigation--during which those he has accused will 
testify--will show who were actually involved in trafficking.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Starting From Scratch' in the Eradication of </F>
Coca Farms"] 
  [Text] The president's initiative to negotiate an extension 
of the so-far strict and rigid deadlines the U.S. Embassy has 
imposed on the elimination of excess coca farms deserves full 
support from the entire country. 
  In Chapare, thousands of peasant families cultivate coca 
leaves for meager earnings because the price paid for their 
product cannot make them rich. The attractive profits remain in 
the hands of Bolivian, Colombian, and U.S. drug traffickers, 
especially U.S. traffickers, who distribute the product among 
consumers. 
  According to official announcements, there are still 1,900 
hectares of coca farms to be eradicated--of the 4,500 the 
previous government had promised to eradicate by 31 March--and 
it is obvious that in the week before the deadline's expiration 
it will be impossible to fulfill the promise. Unless there is an 
intention to provoke a serious confrontation much stronger and 
more tragic than the ones that already have occurred in the 
region. 
  This is the most serious and sensitive problem the nation is 
now confronting. If the Chapare boiler goes off now, the other 
conflicts underlying Bolivian society will immediately worsen, 
provoking violence and instability. To avoid this, it is 
necessary to make all efforts and to be extremely prudent and 
patriotic. 
  If violence prevails in Chapare, there will be no 
capitalization, participation, educational reform, or the other 
proposals. There will be no more democracy, economic growth, and 
inflation control. The country and all its social sectors would 
lose their course, and our homeland would become the appropriate 
stage for the situation that is desired by imperialists and by 
those who advocate military action: a low-intensity war, rapid 
deployment tactics, the use of new conventional weapons, and 
clean, smart bombs. 
  Whoever thinks we are exaggerating should review the course 
of world events to convince himself. Peaceful and prosperous 
societies have suddenly been taken over by violence and, 
obviously, by foreign troops. Peace is for society what freedom 
is for men: It is not appreciated until it is lost, but while 
we enjoy it, we do not realize that we are making use of an 
essential value. 
  President Sanchez de Lozada's timely appeal to the U.S. 
Government, before Vice President Gore, awakened a clumsy 
reaction by Mr. Richard Bowers, which Bolivians have unanimously 
repudiated. He did not use the language of an ambassador, or 
even of a junior diplomat. It is hoped that his superiors in the 
State Department will reprimand him because our Foreign Ministry 
has never dared do it, because of our longstanding weakness. 
  The appropriate thing to do is to outline our position 
directly to Washington, where Vice President Victor Hugo 
Cardenas might go in search of justice. This is what Chayanta 
chief Tomas Catari did 200 years ago when he made a long 
pilgrimage on foot to Buenos Aires to complain to the viceroy 
about the abuses of Governor Joaquin Alos.

  [Text] After lengthy talks, government officials and coca 
growers leaders at 2230 last night signed a five-point agreement 
to end the wave of violence that affected the Cochabamba 
tropical region as a result of the forceful eradication of coca 
plantations. 
  Signing the agreement for the government were Foreign 
Minister Antonio Aranibar, Government Minister German Quiroga, 
Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Sustainable Development 
Minister Jose Guillermo Justiniano. The other side was 
represented by leaders of peasant organizations and coca growers 
led by the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB). The agreement was 
signed after lengthy talks that were at one time almost broken 
due to the intransigence of both sides. 
  The agreement, which was described as successful by the 
peasant leaders, begins by stating that government and labor 
leaders are committed to jointly fighting the drug trade. 
  The second point focuses on the government's commitment to 
refrain from further forced eradication of coca plantations and, 
to this effect, agrees to issue within 15 days a ministerial 
resolution containing pertinent instructions to the appropriate 
organizations. 
  The next point recognizes the government's commitment to 
continue "to search for and to destroy maceration pits and/or 
laboratories, without destroying adjacent coca plantations." 
  The fourth point was the most conflictive, to the point of 
having threatened to causing an impasse in the talks. It 
states: "The government and coca growers leaders will 
participate in the implementation of the provisions of Articles 
10, 14, and 24 of Law 1008. The government vows to implement 
the Alternative Development Program jointly with coca growers 
leaders." 
  The fifth and final point provides for the creation of joint 
commissions to address all problems concerning production, 
marketing, processing, alternative development, and the legal 
and institutional aspects concerning coca production. 
  Following the signing of the agreement, government officials 
and leaders of peasant organizations expressed their 
satisfaction over the outcome of their talks. Foreign Minister 
Aranibar announced that the government yielded on the 
conflictive fourth point "to safeguard social peace and because 
the fight against the drug trade must be waged within a 
framework of respect for the people and for the country." 
  Evo Morales, leader of the coca growers, described the 
agreement as "a major step forward" in the defense of coca, 
which is the only source of income for the peasants of 
Cochabamba and said that the task remaining now is to implement 
alternative development as a condition for replacing the surplus 
coca production.

  [Text] We will now read a news agency report that confirms 
what this newscast previously reported. It states that Isaac 
Oso Chavarria's assistant Edgar Fernandez Lazcano has been 
clandestinely and illegally removed from the country by DEA 
agents. The news agency report states: 
  The U.S. antinarcotics agency has excused itself before the 
Costa Rican Government for not having warned of the transit 
through Costa Rica of a Bolivian citizen who testified that 
former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora is linked with a drug 
trafficker. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman reported that the 
DEA cited urgency in its letter as the reason for not having 
informed the Costa Rican Government of the arrival of Edgar 
Fernandez Lazcano in Costa Rica. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was on his way to Miami on Sunday [3 
April], again reported in Costa Rica that last week--during a 
long testimony before Bolivian Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos 
Herrada--he revealed the alleged links between former Bolivian 
President Jaime Paz Zamora and drug trafficker Isaac Oso 
Chavarria. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was clandestinely removed from 
Bolivia 
by land via Peru, was detained by chance by OIJ [Investigation 
Agency] agents in downtown San Jose during a drug enforcement 
operation. Following some consultations, the Bolivian 
prosecutor and Drug Enforcement Officer Ruben Zegada Portugal 
asked for permission to question him in conjunction with Costa 
Rican officials.

  [Text] The government continues to fail to clarify the 
mysterious manner in which Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, assistant to 
Isaac Oso Chavarria, traveled to Costa Rica to be questioned by 
the DEA. 
  Justice Minister Rene Blattman says he has no information 
about this case, which is being investigated by the Ministry of 
Government. He also does not know whether or not Edgar 
Fernandez Lazcano was forbidden to leave the country. But this 
is not very important, the minister said, as anyone in Bolivia 
can disobey a prohibition from leaving the country and get out 
of Bolivia. The migration under secretary certainly did not 
like this statement from Blattman. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified migration under secretary] 
Did the justice minister say that? Well, he must send me a list 
of the names of people who during my administration have left 
the country in disobedience of an order to remain. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Was Fernandez Lazcano prohibited 
from 
leaving the country? 
  [Under secretary] Fernandez Lazcano? No, he had no order 
prohibiting him from leaving the country. Until the moment he 
left--because it is not known when he left the country--there 
was no order prohibiting him from leaving the country. [end 
recording] 
  If Fernandez Lazcano was not forbidden from leaving the 
country, he could have left the country legally, with a 
passport. The migration office says he did not use it: 
  [Begin under secretary recording] I can tell you that his 
departure is not registered in any airport controlled by the 
Migration Undersecretariat. The only thing I can tell you is 
that if he left the country he could have left using one of the 
many ways used by people linked with drug trafficking, through 
clandestine air strips or by land. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the president of the Republic has met with 
several 
ministers to discuss this subject, and it has been reported that 
in the next few hours a communique will be released to the 
public explaining how Edgar Fernandez Lazcano left Bolivia. 
  In turn, the DEA was criticized in political circles for 
having kidnapped Edgar Fernandez Lazcano to question him in 
Costa Rica. Bolivian congressmen agree that the U.S. DEA owes an 
explanation to Bolivia. 
  [Begin Deputy Fernando Kieffer Guzman recording] Yes, of 
course, I think they acted in excess and arbitrarily, which must 
be repaired as soon as possible; otherwise this will 
unnecessarily affect U.S.-Bolivian relations, as there was no 
real reason for this action. The two objectives sought by the 
DEA in this case could have been met: that Fernandez Lazcano act 
as a witness in court, and also as a witness in the lawsuits 
that are being followed in the United States. Right? But this 
was a precipitate, clumsy action. It was an abuse... [end 
recording] 
  MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] Deputy Fernando 
Campero said that in the case of Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, 
Bolivian sovereignty is being trampled upon. 
  [Begin Campero recording] The amendment approved some time 
ago by the U.S. Congress, which authorizes the kidnapping of 
individuals linked with drug trafficking even without the 
knowledge or coordination with the officials of the foreign 
country, represents an offense to the dignity of our countries. 
I think that in this joint struggle carried out jointly by the 
United States and all the rest of the countries against this 
scourge which is drug trafficking, we should seek mechanisms of 
coordination and mutual respect. [end recording] 
  So far, neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the 
Government Ministry have made any statements on this sensitive 
subject.

  [Editorial Report] The Bolivian press has been warning that 
a Chiapas-style rebellion could erupt in the country because of 
similar socioeconomic conditions affecting a large portion of 
the population. On 20 February, La Paz PRESENCIA, a Catholic 
Church-owned center-left daily, published a special report 
entitled "The Chiapas Syndrome, Vaccine Sought Urgently," which 
reviewed the Indian uprising in Mexico and commented on the 
possibility of it occurring in Bolivia. The report included 
interviews with Bolivian Vice President Hugo Cardenas, 
sociologist Javier Hurtado, and Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) 
deputy Miguel Urioste. All three expressed sympathy for Indian 
and peasant demands and urged that they be addressed through 
democratic processes, not armed struggle. To this end they are 
promoting the government's current reform programs. 
  In the PRESENCIA interview Vice President Hugo Cardenas, 
Bolivia's first Indian official at that level, described the 
recent events in Mexico as "worrisome" for Bolivia the "lack of 
solidarity with the poor could pave the way for a Chiapas-style 
guerrilla uprising." "We Indians have shed the most blood in the 
struggle against injustice," he explained, "and we are fed up." 
He also pointed out that "the arrival of an Indian to the vice 
presidency doesn't mean that prejudice and injustice have ceased 
to exist." Cardenas argued that the problems resulting from 
"political and social exclusion"--lack of education and health 
services, low salaries, unequal land distribution, migration to 
the cities, and poverty in general--"should have been solved by 
now" and that these topics "should be the most important issues 
on the continent's political agenda." Instead, he noted, the 
first steps are just being taken, after 169 years, to 
incorporate the "approximately 42 percent of Bolivian society," 
previously excluded from the decisionmaking processes of the 
state, into the political system. Cardenas expressed confidence 
that the "mentality of commitment" now prevailing among the 
power elites in Bolivia would lead the way for the 
transformation of Bolivia from a "democracy of minorities" into 
a "multiethnic and pluricultural democracy." These steps must be 
taken, he insisted, "so that a Chiapas does not occur here." 
  Miguel Urioste, leader of Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) that 
is 
part of the government coalition, and director of TIERRA 
(Workshop for Initiatives in Rural Research and Agrarian 
Reform), agreed with Vice President Cardenas that Indians and 
peasants in Chiapas and Bolivia experienced similar conditions. 
However, Urioste told PRESENCIA that, although Bolivian Indian 
and peasant groups are now "awakening," they are not opting for 
radical or destructive measures but are increasingly proposing 
"constructive solutions" to their problems. Urioste mentioned 
that among the solutions sought by the government, the most 
essential are a redistribution of public investment and a more 
equitable reallocation of resources toward rural areas to give 
the people more say in political and administrative decison 
making. In addition, with the goal of eliminating unproductive 
large estates (latifundios), his party has also been promoting a 
second agrarian reform, more aggressive than that which was 
carried out under the first Agrarian Reform Act of 1953. These 
solutions are embodied in the draft Popular Participation Law, a 
complex and controversial law which is part of President Sanchez 
de Lozada's reform package. Urioste felt optimistic that the law 
would "substantially modify society's representational 
structures." For example, he explained, 300 rural municipalities 
would be created, comprising 12,145 peasant and Indian 
communities. "For the first time in Bolivia's history," these 
communities would have legal jurisdiction and their elected 
traditional authorities would also be legally recognized. The 
newly created municipalities "would receive 19 percent of 
Treasury tax revenues" to directly administer and manage the 
communities' education and health centers, as well as the 
irrigation systems, construction projects, and road networks. He 
stressed that an important provision of the law would require 
that resources be allocated to regions according to number of 
inhabitants, thereby eliminating previous "imbalances." Urioste 
said that "although centuries of poverty could not be eliminated 
in one or four years," he was confident that "we are still in 
time to correct the mistakes and prevent a rude awakening of 
Bolivia's Indian people." 
  Bolivian sociologist Javier Hurtado, in his comments to 
PRESENCIA, observed that in Bolivia despite the reforms brought 
about by the 1952 Revolution, things have changed little for the 
peasants. "The struggle for land remains a central theme," he 
explained, and "racial discrimination is still strongly rooted." 
He also believes that the present economic system has only 
served to "accentuate the polarization of poverty versus 
opulence" in the country, and that this could lead to a 
Chiapas-like situation. "To alleviate this tension," he said, 
Bolivians should "start thinking about repeating an April 1952 
Revolution with significant reforms," as well as "correcting the 
technical errors of the first Agrarian Reform of 1953." 
  Concern that the Chiapas uprising could be repeated in 
Bolivia, especially in the Chapare region of Cochabamba 
Department, was expressed in various issues of the Cochabamba 
daily LOS TIEMPOS. The government there had been carrying out a 
program of limited forced coca eradication in compliance with 
"Law 1008," which requires the eradication of one hectare of 
coca for every cocaine maceration pit found in the area. These 
actions, opposed by coca growers, led to violence in early March 
between the growers and special eradication forces. According to 
the 3 March issue of LOS TIEMPOS, Evo Morales, leader of the 
coca growers' confederation, issued an "official" statement on 2 
March threatening violent resistance similar to the Chiapas 
uprising if "the government does not cease its forced 
eradication of these crops." The 9 March LOS TIEMPOS reported 
that President Sanchez de Lozada admitted that the country was a 
"time bomb," and, according to the same daily, the Bishop of La 
Paz, Monsignor Luis Sainz, said that the Church sided with the 
peasants in opposing the forced destruction of coca crops, and 
that "before eradicating coca, the government should eradicate 
poverty." 
  A 20 February commentary in LOS TIEMPOS by Jose Luis Roca, 
entitled "Symptoms of Social Instability in the Chapare," 
observed that "in Bolivia, the Chapare area could become the 
epicenter of serious social conflict." The Chapare, he 
continued, "is like a boiling cauldron that hasn't yet exploded 
only because of its pressure valves, which are the relative 
freedom to grow and market coca leaf." The commentator noted 
that the situation in the Chapare is potentially more volatile 
than that in Mexico because in Chiapas, at least, "a trained 
people's army conducts negotiations on an equal basis with its 
government (which raises hope for a negotiated solution)." In 
the Chapare, he continued, "there is the risk of collective 
suicide because the peasants' reactions are totally irrational, 
motivated only by desperation and hunger." The author feared 
that drug traffickers could exploit any unrest to perpetrate 
"horrible actions in our country," like the ones which "have 
plunged Peru and Colombia into a bloodbath." 
  A 1 March editorial in LOS TIEMPOS entitled "Violence in the 
Chapare" echoes previously expressed concerns and asserts that 
"eradication of coca bushes is only carried out when it is 
necessary to make a gesture to obtain economic aid from foreign 
governments." The Chapare, noted the editorial, could become a 
chronic area of conflict," as long as the government is 
incapable of formulating a "general policy on coca and drug 
trafficking that truly meets long-term national interests rather 
than short-term party interests." 
  According to La Paz Television Nacional Network on 26 March, 
an agreement was finally reached in which the government 
promised to desist from any forced eradication. The coca growers 
believe this agreement represents a victory for them, and the 
government believes the agreement "will ensure peace and the 
implementation of alternative development in the coca-producing 
regions."

  [Excerpts] Rio de Janeiro district attorney Antonio Carlos 
Biscaia has released an official list of 150 people charged with 
having received bribes from numbers game operators. Former 
President Fernando Collor de Mello and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo 
Maluf are included on the list. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to Collor and Maluf, the list includes Rio de 
Janeiro Governor Nilo Batista and Deputy Cleto Falcao. Written 
next to the names of Collor and Maluf are entries indicating 
that they received donations for their 1989 electoral campaign. 
There are also documents indicating that donations were made 
for a rally of then candidate Paulo Maluf in Rio de Janeiro. 
  Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf has denied the charge that the 
numbers game operators made donations for his electoral 
campaign. He vowed to press charges against Biscaia. 
  [Begin recording] This is an individual who is hysterically 
trying to get into the limelight. He is just a hasty, 
irresponsible rascal. His charge is a lie. I have never 
received any help from anyone. I have put the case in the hands 
of criminal lawyer Enio de Bastos Barros, who will bring this 
irresponsible individual to court. [end recording] 
  In a statement, Collor also denied any donation to his 
campaign by kingpins of the numbers game. The former president 
contends that he fought the numbers game during his tenure as 
governor of Alagoas State. He adds that he was already found 
not guilty in the inquiries made of his accounts during the 
impeachment process. He concludes by stating that his 
executioners have already testified to the fact that he has 
never received one single cent from the illegal game he 
tenaciously fought as governor. [passage omitted] 
  Federal prosecutors who are participating in the Rio de 
Janeiro district attorney's investigations are increasingly 
convinced that the numbers game was nothing but a front for 
other much more lucrative businesses, such as arms smuggling and 
the international drug trade. 
  The prosecutors were quite impressed by the volume of 
transactions maintained by numbers game operators with some 
South American countries, such as the ties numbers game kingpin 
Rodomiro Garcia maintained with one of the most notorious 
Paraguayan smugglers: Carlos Barreto Sarubbi [governor of Alto 
Parana Department]. 
  Rodomiro Garcia and Barreto Sarubbi own a casino in Ciudad 
del Este, Paraguay, across the border from Foz do Iguacu. 
Garcia also owns a large estate in Paraguay, approximately 10 
km from the Brazilian border. Barreto also owns an airstrip. 
He has been charged by U.S. police with having used the 
airstrip for many years for arms smuggling and drug trafficking 
operations.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- A person very close to numbers 
game kingpin Castor de Andrade has sent a lot of money to Cali, 
Colombia--the seat of one of the largest cocaine trafficking 
cartels. Documents proving this remittance were seized at Casto 
de Andrade's fortress. Rio de Janeiro Attorney Antonio Carlos 
Biscaia said: "The numbers game is no longer just the game that 
so many people enjoy; it is a mask behind which several forms of 
organized crime hide." 
  Attorneys examining the numbers game kingpins' accounts have 
also found that in January 1993, Castor de Andrade deposited 
$500,000 in the Swiss Banks Association. Biscaia said: "The 
numbers game has been used to permeate crime throughout society, 
by bribing policemen and judges, by supporting samba groups and 
soccer teams, and even by financing politicians' electoral 
campaigns." These accounting books list sums paid to several 
candidates and contributions to political campaigns. Biscaia 
said: "It is all written down in the books, even the $100,000 
given to a major candidate."

  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Congressional sources today 
told EFE that the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies is investigating 
reports on the exchange of young prostitutes for cocaine on the 
Brazilian border with Bolivia. 
  A delegation of three deputies today went to investigate the 
charges raised by residents of Brazilian townships located in 
border areas with Bolivia in Mato Grosso, Acre, and Rondonia. 
  The deputies investigating the report are socialist Deputy 
Chico Vigilante and conservative Deputies Maria Valadin and 
Zelia Mendes, who serve on the Chamber special committee that 
investigates child prostitution. 
  According to the reports received by the committee, the 
minors are in the 11-16 age bracket--although one was eight 
years old. They are exchanged for cocaine and taken to coca 
growing and producing areas in Bolivia as prostitutes for the 
men working there. 
  The delegation will hear testimonies of state and municipal 
officials and local residents. 
  Some witnesses told the congressmen that a presumably 
Brazilian couple is recruiting minors in the Amazon region, 
ostensibly to work as household servants in Sao Paulo, but these 
minors are taken to the border with Bolivia to be exchanged for 
cocaine. 
  The congressional committee, which started to work six 
months 
ago, will release its final report on 31 May. 
  Social democratic Deputy Moroni Torgan, who is a police 
officer and the rapporteur of this committee, was rather 
cautious about this case but did not rule out this type of crime.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonio Matiello and Ana Maria Mandim: "Brizola </F>
Prevented Federal Police Operation on Hill"] 
  [Text] Governor Leonel Brizola confirmed yesterday in 
Washington that it was his decision to cancel an operation set 
up by the Federal Police--with the support of the Army--to take 
Alemao Hill (Northern Zone) last 10 December and end its control 
by Orlando Conceicao ("Orlando Jogador"), the most wanted 
trafficker in the state. 
  The operation was planned over a period of four months 
following an initial raid on 31 August 1993, when 40 Federal 
Police agents were met with heavy weapons fire on that same 
hill, where "Jogador" controls the distribution of drugs to 
seven neighboring hills. The hill was being protected by 160 men 
armed with AR-15 rifles, Uzi submachineguns, and automatic 
pistols. "The counterattack by the traffickers, who were 
descending in columns, was a tactic used in military combat," 
says a police officer who took part in the first operation. 
  Preparation--That reception impressed the police and the 
Army. Federal agents spent the next four months studying 
photographs and maps of the area. The new raid was to be 
launched on 10 December. It called for 70 agents to take 
possession of strategic points on Alemao Hill at around 1900 so 
that eight Army helicopters could then attack the summit the 
following morning. 
  Brizola explained his cancellation of the invasion by saying 
in Washington--where he has gone in connection with the release 
of a World Bank loan that will be used to clean up pollution in 
Guanabara Bay--that he felt that the operation was disorganized 
and that it lacked coordination with the State Police. 
  According to his special adviser, Fernando Britto, the 
governor does not rule out cooperation between the Army and 
Federal Police in the fight against drugs and weapons. "But from 
the way the operation was being carried out, its character was 
much more a matter of bullying than anything else," Britto added. 
  Alarm--According to federal agents, the absence of 
coordination with the State Police was intentional. The purpose 
was to prevent the traffickers from being warned. After the 
first raid, in August, the Federal Police prepared a detailed 
report on the way they had been received by the traffickers, 
with an emphasis on what was considered military tactical 
organization. 
  In Washington, the governor said that "if raids on the hills 
actually solved anything, there would be no more traffickers or 
outlaws or anything else in Rio de Janeiro, because the 
dictatorship wore itself out conducting operations of that kind, 
even with the use of helicopters, and it didn't help at all." 
Leonel Brizola reiterated that bringing the matter "to the 
surface" now was an "act of political exploitation."

<F P=106> [Article by Renato Cordeiro: "More Violent Baixada"] </F>
  [Text] The move by big traffickers from Rio de Janeiro to 
extend their operations to shantytowns in Baixada Fluminense is 
worrying police and threatening to reverse the trend in that 
region's homicide rate, which has been declining for the past 
five years. According to Police Chief Paulo Souto, director of 
the Baixada General Police Department, the past six months have 
seen a significant increase in the number of drug traffickers in 
the area's municipalities, resulting in battles between "native" 
outlaws and those migrating from Rio de Janeiro. 
  In the police chief's opinion, that explains the scare 
caused 
by last weekend's violence, during which 27 homicides were 
reported in Baixada Fluminense--the highest figure in three 
years. Souto said he had already identified Rio de Janeiro gangs 
dominating the traffic in places such as the Lixao shantytown in 
Duque de Caxias--which is constantly being invaded by 
traffickers from Vigario Geral--and Vila Norma on the border 
between Sao Jose de Meriti and Nilopolis. 
  Flight--According to the police chief, the outlaws are 
trying 
to leave Rio de Janeiro in search of more control or, in some 
cases, to escape repression in the capital's shantytowns. "The 
homicide rate had been falling thanks to our efforts to 
prioritize repression of the extermination groups. What is 
happening now is a new causative factor," Souto said. 
  Decline--January provided one indication of the rising 
number 
of murders in the region: 197 compared to 176 in December. The 
data for February are not yet complete, but there were probably 
176 murders that month, whereas March is showing another 
increase. Over the past five years, police have been recording a 
decline in the number of murders: 2,683 in 1989, 2,572 in 1990, 
2,256 in 1991, 2,090 in 1992, and 2,040 in 1993. The 
municipality of Queimados, which has the smallest population in 
Baixada Fluminense, had five murders between Friday night and 
Sunday night, making it proportionately the most violent 
municipality that weekend.

<F P=106> [Article: "Police Clear up Slaughters in Vigario Geral"] </F>
  [Text] The first arrest of a participant in the massacre of 
four military police [PM] officers in Catole do Rocha Square--a 
crime that led to the slaughter of 21 persons in the Vigario 
Geral shantytown in the early morning hours on 30 August 
1993--occurred last Saturday. Alexandre Santana ("Caninana"), 
who is a lieutenant of trafficker Flavio Pires da Silva ("Flavio 
Negao"), also confessed to the execution of two PM officers last 
19 February near the Iraja Cemetery, participation in the 
robbing of an armored car owned by Transpev on 24 February, and 
participation in the killing of 14 individuals on Mangueira Hill 
during a battle between traffickers on Carnival Sunday. 
  "Caninana" was arrested along with Monica Nazareth Moco, 
wife 
of "Flavio Negao's" chief lieutenant, Ulissiano do Nascimento 
("Ulisses"), during a raid that took 32 officers from the Drug 
Enforcement Division (DRE) to Vigario Geral. 
  According to Walter Alves de Oliveira, head of the DRE, the 
arrest of "Caninana" confirms that Marcelo Carlos do Nascimento 
("Arregalado"), "Flavio Negao," and "Ulisses" took part in 
killing the four PM officers in Vigario Geral on the night of 28 
August 1993. "`Caninana' said that the PM officers were killed 
because traffickers in the shantytown have a radio on which they 
listen to Military Police transmissions. So `Flavio Negao' knew 
that the police officers were headed for Catole do Rocha 
Square," the police chief said. 
  According to Oliveira, the only motive given by "Caninana" 
for slaughtering the PM officers was "an order from `Flavio 
Negao.'" Monica, the wife of "Ulisses," had helped her husband 
escape during the raid on Saturday. She was released after 
giving a statement. 
<H5>  Trafficking Bosses Form Alliance </H5>
  According to Police Chief Walter Alves de Oliveira, head of 
the DRE, a new alliance among traffickers in Rio de Janeiro's 
shantytowns was revealed in statements by Alexandre Santana 
("Caninana"), a killer who is one of the lieutenants in the gang 
headed by "Flavio Negao," head of the drug traffic in Vigario 
Geral. "He said that traffickers from the shantytowns of Vigario 
Geral, Varginha, and Turano took part in the `war' that claimed 
14 victims (`Caninana' took part in six of those murders) during 
Carnival. They were supporting trafficker `Polegar' of Mangueira 
Hill," the police chief said. 
  Here are the other crimes in which "Caninana" confessed to 
having participated: 
  Sergeant Ailton Benedito Ferreira, Corporal Irapuan Calixto 
Caetano, and Privates Jose Carlos Santana and Luis Mendonca 
Santos, all of the 9th BPM [Military Police Battalion], were 
massacred with AR-15 rifle fire--by men working for trafficker 
"Flavio Negao"--in Catole do Rocha Square in Vigario Geral on 
the night of 28 August last year. 
  Two PM officers, Robson Barros da Silva and Jose Carlos 
Cardoso, were murdered near the Iraja Cemetery last 19 February. 
According to "Caninana," those deaths were the work of the gang 
headed by trafficker "Flavio Negao." Trafficker Marcio Glacie da 
Rocha ("Socrates") also died during that slaughter. According to 
the head of the DRE, "Caninana" said that the body of "Socrates" 
was taken to the Vigario Geral shantytown, where a death 
certificate for the trafficker was arranged. He was then given a 
discreet burial in the Iraja Cemetery. 
  On 24 February, 20 men from a "backwoods commando unit," 
armed with AR-15 and FAL rifles, shotguns, and submachineguns, 
intercepted a Transpev armored car (license No. OK 1399) on the 
Presidente Dutra Highway in the Jardim America neighborhood and 
stole two small trunks containing 4.5 million cruzeiros and 
checks. According to "Caninana," that operation was also carried 
out by "Flavio Negao's" gang.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff is disappointed 
with everything and everyone and is very seriously considering 
the possibility of resigning. This is our newscast's 
confidential report. The serious dispute between Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff and U.S. Government authorities in the 
past days, added to his differences with top officials in 
President Cesar Gaviria's government on all his recent actions, 
has brought up the possibility of his resignation. 
  According to information obtained by this newscast, de 
Greiff 
is seriously considering the possibility of officially tendering 
his resignation next Monday, when he returns from the United 
States. Entirely trustworthy sources have asserted that the 
prosecutor general will resign because he is disappointed with, 
what he has called, the Colombian Government's lack of 
solidarity to confront the strong criticism by U.S. authorities 
who accuse him of being weak in his negotiations with the drug 
traffickers. 
  This newscast has also established that next week, the 
prosecutor general will also present a long document where he 
will clarify his actions with legal arguments and point out that 
all his measures have been in accord with the strict 
implementation of the new criminal law. Prosecutor General de 
Grieff and the Supreme Court chief justice met today to talk, 
precisely, about the need to change this law for a stronger one. 
  In addition, de Grieff will declare that the Prosecutor 
General's Office is hindered in continuing the investigation of 
the case of the attack on the Avianca plane and will ask the 
government to appoint ad hoc officials to this case, which 
caused his differences with the United States to increase.

  [Text] Cali, Colombia, 10 Apr (AFP) -- One of the attorneys 
for a repentant drug trafficker has told AFP that the process 
whereby Cali Cartel drug "barons" can surrender to justice has 
been "completely halted" because of the dispute between U.S. and 
Colombian justice officials. The process had started in March. 
  One of Julio Fabio Urdinola's lawyers, who spoke to AFP on 
the condition of anonymity, said: "There are no negotiations 
under way with authorities. The process has been completely 
halted." 
  The jurist made these statements in front of the main gate 
of 
Palmira Prison near Cali (490 km southwest of Santa Fe de 
Bogota), where his client has been detained since his 12 March 
surrender. 
  A high security pavilion that will house those drug 
traffickers who surrender is still under construction at Palmira 
Prison (40 km northeast of Cali). Construction is expected to 
be completed in June. 
  Julio Fabio Urdinola, 29, is considered one of the leaders 
of 
the Northern Valle del Cauca Cartel, which is closely linked to 
the Cali Cartel. U.S. and Colombian narcotics agents are 
accusing the Cali Cartel of supplying about 70 percent of all 
cocaine consumed in the United States and Europe. Urdinola's 
surrender, the first by a Cali drug "baron," took place 11 days 
after 28-year-old Yonier Espinosa surrendered. Espinosa is also 
a Northern Valle del Cauca Cartel member. 
  These two surrenders prompted speculation that Gilberto 
Rodriguez Orejuela, alleged Cali Cartel chief, could surrender 
soon. Rodriguez's lawyers were also negotiating with 
authorities. Urdinola's lawyer, however, pointed out that 
Rodriguez's surrender is now highly unlikely because of the 
dispute between U.S. and Colombian judicial authorities. He 
added: "The North Americans have created a tense situation, 
because they oppose the surrenders." 
  On several occasions, U.S. judicial authorities have accused 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff of being too lenient on 
repentant drug traffickers. The U.S. State Department [as 
received] stopped handing over evidence against drug 
traffickers, because it believes it has only led to light 
sentences. 
  In view of such criticism, the Colombian Government 
distanced 
itself from De Greiff, and Attorney General Gustavo Arrieta 
proposed a revision of the penal code. The current penal code, 
which has been in force for the past six months, indeed seems to 
be particularly tolerant of drug traffickers, because in some 
cases, it stipulates that those who confess are eligible to be 
put on probation. 
  Within the past few months, the U.S. State Department also 
admonished Colombian officials for failing to try a major drug 
trafficker and for doing nothing to confiscate the trafficker's 
large fortune. 
  A visit to Cali can underscore the scope of the wealth of 
drug traffickers. It is common knowledge that the most 
exclusive Cali neighborhood, Ciudad Jardin, is almost completely 
controlled by the local mafia. Ciudad Jardin is a row of 
beautiful mansions, most of which have pools. High walls 
protect the most opulent mansions, which are constantly guarded 
by security agents on permanent alert. 
  A somewhat nervous taxi driver said during a quick tour of 
the neighborhood: "You had better not take pictures here; you 
could be mistaken for a DEA agent."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Attorney General Carlos </F>
Gustavo Arrieta by Caracol News Director Dario Arizmendi in 
Santa Fe de Bogota on 8 April; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" 
newscast--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] We greet Attorney General Carlos 
Gustavo Arrieta. Good day. 
  [Arrieta] Good morning, Dario. How are you? 
  [Arizmendi] In the last few hours you reiterated the thesis 
you maintained in Congress during discussion of the new Penal 
Procedure Code, in the sense the approved provisions were going 
to create confusion, ambiguity, and would lend themselves to 
criticism from national and international public opinion. Have 
your statements been corroborated in practice? 
  [Arrieta] You know the Attorney General's Office has 
maintained a position in this regard for a long time. We 
believe if this country wants to develop a serious and coherent 
criminal policy on the drug struggle, it must have solid and 
strong regulations that permit it to advance in this matter. I 
think this does not exist. 
  The Attorney General's Office has stated on several 
occasions 
the Penal Code is weak and does not establish appropriate 
sentences for drug trafficking crimes, and the Penal Procedure 
Code is a confused and profuse regulation. It does not 
establish clear procedures, and if it is handled 
inappropriately, it could lead to impunity. 
  [Arizmendi] What would have to be done to strengthen this 
Penal Code and establish appropriate sentences to avoid what is 
happening? 
  [Arrieta] I believe the country must definitely undertake an 
integral project to reform the Penal Code and the Penal 
Procedure Code. I am not aiming at a large project to modify 
all the provisions, but coherent legislation should be issued 
regarding drug trafficking. 
  Something very worrisome is taking place. As violence 
increased during the last six or seven years, occasional 
legislative reactions have sprung up, and new and different 
provisions have been issued. A judge or attorney must now apply 
60 or 70 different provisions concerning drug trafficking in 
order to understand the norm or applicable situation in a 
particular case; this creates confusion and does not produce the 
necessary clarity in dealing with this matter. 
  Naturally, the country's problem is not related to 
regulations only, but it has many additional aspects. One of 
the first steps that would have to be taken is a definite 
integration, coherently and systematically, with existing 
legislation so as to tighten sentences and clarify procedures. 
  [Arizmendi] A desire and unanimous decision by the various 
organizations would be required, namely, from the Justice 
Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Attorney 
General's Office; this agreement does not exist. 
  [Arrieta] I think this requires an effort by all concerned 
organizations, not only the government, judiciary, or Attorney 
General's Office but also Congress, which is ultimately 
responsible for issuing the codes. I believe the gravity of the 
circumstances and the questioning of Colombia justify an 
unvarying and strong reaction from all Colombians to show that 
this country is not a narcodemocracy. We must demonstrate this 
is a country that is indeed ready to fight drug trafficking. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] Colombia at this moment is in the eye of the 
U.S. 
media and many U.S. congressmen. The country is well aware of 
the letter exchanges between the Prosecutor General's Office and 
the U.S. attorney general, the response of the Colombian 
ambassador to THE WASHINGTON POST's [6 April] article by Senator 
Kerry. In sum, does this confusion and confrontation originate 
in the verbal recklessness of the prosecutor or existing 
regulations? 
  [Arrieta] I think there are many factors that come into play 
here. I think we are facing a problem that has evolved for no 
reason. From basic discussions on legalization issues we have 
gone to such expressions as narcodemocracy or the questioning of 
Colombian justice. I think this is the right time to end this. 
  I do not know what is the cause and cannot offer a specific 
solution. The cause may be a combination of the factors you 
mentioned. The absolute truth is I, as attorney general and a 
Colombian citizen, cannot allow this to continue. We have 
reached such harsh terms as the ones we have seen in recent days 
without any justification. The [word indistinct] has snowballed 
into such dimensions I believe we must put a definitive end to 
this, because this is affecting not only the functioning of 
Colombian institutions but relations with the United States. 
This may have more serious effects we cannot foresee at this 
moment. 
  Our responsibility is to end this problem. We must not act 
separately, but we must act in a coordinated manner. 
  [Arizmendi] How can we end this problem, and how can we act 
in a coordinated manner? Who is the one out of line? 
  [Arrieta] I told you earlier I will issue a communique today 
on that issue. In it, we will adopt a position on this matter. 
We will provide a complete picture of what has happened, but at 
this moment I believe it is fundamental for us to make an effort 
so that the situation will not continue to intensify and does 
not affect all Colombians. [passage omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Attorney General, turning to another topic, 
and going back somewhat to what we were talking about at the 
beginning of our conversation, you said on television last night 
that at this time you do not think the conditions or 
circumstances exist for new surrenders of Cali Cartel drug 
traffickers. On what basis did you make this statement? 
  [Arrieta] I think what we discussed a short while ago 
sufficiently supports this. I do not think the conditions exist 
at this specific time. The environment is not the appropriate 
one. There is a great distrust and prejudice; there is great 
concern about the whole topic. I think the most important thing 
is to calm the waters again, to have the authorities sit down 
and agree on policy and then proceed with the surrender to 
justice program. 
  In these days, at this particular moment, I think the 
atmosphere is too heated to make a surrender to justice process 
feasible. I am not setting a time limit; this might be solved 
in eight, 10, 15 days or in one or two months. What I have 
always said is that the surrender to justice policy is important 
for the country. It is useful. I think that as Colombians we 
should try to move forward with it, with clear and firm rules, 
but as circumstances stand at this time, with the level of 
debates taking place both nationally and internationally, I 
think there should be at least a halt, a temporary halt, which 
might last a few days or somewhat longer, according to [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Arizmendi] In other words, we might say the attorney 
general 
is proposing the process of surrender to justice by the drug 
traffickers be frozen until there is an agreement, juridical or 
political, to make the sentences against these drug traffickers 
harsher or more rigorous? 
  [Arrieta] I cannot propose that it be frozen, among other 
things, simply because the legal provisions exist and they 
establish the possibilities of surrender; therefore, if tomorrow 
an individual presents himself before a prosecutor or judge of 
the country, there is no other alternative but to receive him. 
What I think is that regarding a broad case, such as that of 
the Cali Cartel, which has political and juridical [word 
indistinct] and which requires full coordination among all the 
authorities, I do not think it would be appropriate to advance 
with this process until we reach agreement on all the parameters 
under which we should act. As soon as that occurs, something 
which might be done very rapidly, then we could--if this is what 
is desired--continue with that process. At this time, at a time 
of debate, when the atmosphere is heated, and when positions are 
not entirely clear, I think, however, it would not be 
appropriate, because the country would simply not understand it, 
precisely because of the prevailing climate of distrust and 
confusion. 
  [Arizmendi] You said the legal provisions exist, evidently 
in 
the Penal Code and the Penal Procedures Code. You also said in 
the past the surrender to justice policy has ended, replaced by 
the codes. If the sentences are evidently so minimal, 
ridiculous, and short as certain U.S. authorities assert, one 
might then think this is exactly the best time for the Cali 
Cartel drug traffickers to surrender massively before the codes 
are reformed and made harsher. 
  [Arrieta] Of course, of course. That is the position they 
[not further identified] might want. I think our position, as a 
state, is precisely to try to design all the mechanisms so there 
will be a surrender process, but one that will not create any 
feeling of impunity under any viewpoint. Of course, what you 
mentioned is part of the dilemma that always arises. On the one 
hand, there are a number of people who want to take advantage of 
the law for their own benefit; this is inevitable and is the 
reason why lawyers, procedures, and legal provisions exist. On 
the other hand, there is the state, which has the responsibility 
to fulfill its social function and to ensure those legal 
provisions are applied the best way possible. What I am 
suggesting is that there be a review of the overall reform of 
the legal provisions so that we can have a Penal Code, 
procedural provisions, and a surrender to justice policy which 
are clear and which do not produce any kind of impunity. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] Why is the prosecutor general the only one 
taking all the flak when all he is really doing is interpreting 
and applying code provisions. In Congress you courageously 
warned the country about what was coming, and unfortunately time 
has shown you were right. But the prosecutor general was not 
the one who drew up the codes. It was Congress, and in Congress 
Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez even changed the meaning of 
certain bills, and he defended what was finally approved in 
Congress. Now the prosecutor general is the one being 
criticized when the government was also involved in what was 
finally approved. The government signed the law. 
  [Arrieta] I think one has to put this issue back into 
perspective. If one looks at what has been taking place in the 
past two or three months, there have not really been new actions 
in the application of the Penal and Penal Procedures Codes. 
There has been debate, and it has been growing, but only based 
on topics that are not directly linked to the Penal Procedures 
Code, such as the issue of legalization and the issue of whether 
the struggle against drug trafficking has worked. All of this 
has led us to a debate what not only involves thinking about 
aspects of policy but also aspects of norms. 
  I agree with you in part that a portion of the problem is 
not 
only caused by isolated actions but also by the very existence 
of legal provisions which are not clear and are inappropriate; 
therefore, what we propose is that we halt a debate that is not 
taking us anywhere. With the increase in crime, what we 
Colombians must do is form a barrier, a united front, with 
everyone confronting the problem. Facing the problem entails a 
review of legal provisions to resolve all those vacuums, all 
those weaknesses that might exist in the codes. It entails 
acting in a coordinated way, because it is a problem of national 
interest, which not only involves one institution but all 
Colombians. 
  [Arizmendi] Lastly, Mr. Attorney General, and thank you for 
your willingness to speak with Caracol network so extensively 
about such relevant topics, I would like to know whether the 
Attorney General's Office knows the names of the infiltrator in 
the Prosecutor General's Office, who the State Department says 
belongs to the Cali Cartel, and four high-ranking government 
officials, who the State Department said last night also work 
for the Cali Cartel? 
  [Arrieta] I want to make a comment regarding the question. 
In the State Department report, it is said the Colombian 
Government is studying the fourth-ranking person in the office 
of what they call the Attorney General [preceding two words in 
English]. The Americans make a distinction between the office 
of the Attorney General [preceding two words in English], which 
is the Attorney General's Office [Procuraduria General de la 
Nacion], and the office of the Prosecutor General [preceding two 
words in English], which is the Prosecutor General's Office 
[Fiscal General de la Nacion]. When they said the 
fourth-ranking person in the office of the Attorney General 
[preceding two words in English] was being investigated, they 
were referring to what they called the fourth-ranking person in 
the Attorney General's Office. It is a case that for us has 
been extremely mortifying and painful. It is the case of Dr. 
(Guillermo Villa). They were not referring to a person in the 
Prosecutor General's Office but to a person in the Attorney 
General's Office. It is a case that is well known and has been 
sufficiently debated by public opinion. I think it is important 
that this be clarified, because shadows of doubt should not be 
cast over other people. Regarding the other four people who 
might be investigated, I do not have information about them. 
  [Arizmendi] In the case of Dr. (Guillermo Villa Alzate), who 
you just mentioned, what is happening? 
  [Arrieta] I think the process is about to conclude. The 
final phases of the evidence period are being carried out, and, 
as far as the Attorney General's Office is concerned, I hope 
that in the course of the next few weeks, at the latest in one 
or two months, a definitive decision is going to be made.

<F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Caracol has just obtained the text of the letter 
sent by Gabriel Silva Lujan, Colombian ambassador to the United 
States, to U.S. Senator John Kerry regarding the senator's 
repeated criticism of the surrendering to justice policy and the 
interpretation and implementation of the Penal Procedure Code by 
the Prosecutor General's Office. In a strong response to an 
article by Senator Kerry, which was published in THE WASHINGTON 
POST yesterday [6 April], Ambassador Silva Lujan has stated: As 
you acknowledge, the Colombian Government differs in opinion 
with the Prosecutor General's Office, an independent office 
which is part of the judicial branch. These differences, 
Ambassador Silva Lujan has admitted, are still significant; 
therefore, he added, de Greiff's opinions on the negotiation of 
sentences and legalization of drugs do not represent those of 
the Colombian Government. 
  As I have said in the past, Gabriel Silva added, the 
Colombian Government will oppose the surrender of drug 
traffickers under conditions that are inconsistent with their 
level of criminal guilt. Furthermore, the Colombian Government 
has not supported, does not support, nor will support the 
legalization of drugs as a strategy in the antidrug struggle. 
  We at Caracol must add that Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff's position on this topic is 180 degrees different from 
that of Colombian Ambassador Silva Lujan in that letter. 
  In his two-page letter, whose original was in English and 
whose translation was obtained by Caracol, the ambassador added 
the Cali Cartel's greatest achievement would be to provoke a 
breakdown in judicial cooperation between the two countries. In 
his document, the ambassador also vehemently rejected the 
assertion Colombia is a narcodemocracy: Colombia, the oldest 
and most politically stable democracy in Latin America, has been 
maintained despite the narcoterrorists' attacks. The Colombian 
people have made enormous sacrifices in defending their 
democracy. Your hasty assertions are an affront against 
Colombians' courageous commitment to their institutions. 
  In his letter to Senator Kerry, Ambassador Silva also denied 
the senator's assertion the Cali Cartel has significant economic 
interests in the sectors of banking, finance, shipping, mining, 
coffee, petroleum, and flowers. The ambassador has said such 
assertions are unacceptable and groundless: It is untrue the 
Cali Cartel controls the most important sectors of the Colombian 
economy. These sectors are formed by respectable businessmen and 
companies, many of which have permanent relations with the 
United States. As in other countries, including the United 
States, organized crime seeks to infiltrate certain sectors of 
the legal economy, but this does not mean it controls some of 
these sectors or that the government tolerates its presence. 
  Colombian Ambassador Silva has also said Kerry's statement 
that the Cali Cartel controls important elements of the 
Colombian media is false: For a long time, courageous 
journalists have been at the forefront of the crusade against 
drug traffickers. Investigative journalism in Colombia has 
played a fundamental role, revealing the illegal activities of 
drug-trafficking organizations. For this reason, many 
journalists and media have been victims of the drug cartels' 
kidnapping, assassinations, and terrorist attacks. In short, 
you have cast an undeserved shadow of doubt over the integrity 
of the Colombian private sector and media. 
  The ambassador also referred to the corruption linked to 
drugs, stating this proliferates not only in Colombia but also 
in the United States; in fact, the ambassador added, according 
to the report on public integrity of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, more than 5,000 federal employees have been found 
guilty of corruption between 1970 and 1990. 
  This is the vigorous official reply by Colombian Ambassador 
in Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan to Senator Kerry, who again 
attacked our country in an article in THE WASHINGTON POST 
yesterday.

  [Text] On 7 April, key national union leaders categorically 
rejected remarks by the U.S. State Department and, in 
particular, an article published by U.S. Senator John Kerry in 
THE WASHINGTON POST [6 April], in which Kerry claims Colombia is 
a "narcodemocracy" and its economy is pervaded by mafia 
activities. 
  Spokesmen for the banking, industrial, and coffee sectors 
issued statements yesterday from Cartagena, site of a banking 
convention. 
  One of the first statements was issued by Carlos Arturo 
Angel, president of the National Association of Industrialists, 
who pointed out that economies throughout the world are pervaded 
by drug trafficking and that Colombia is not a special case. 
  Angel stated: "We are a small part of a huge business which, 
among other things, conducts a substantial share of its 
operations in industrialized countries, and especially in the 
United States." Angel also asserted that U.S. laws have 
benefited drug traffickers. 
  Cesar Gonzalez, president of the Association of Financial 
Institutions, expressed his confusion about these charges, and 
he conveyed his confidence that these comments do not represent 
a widespread view or the view of the U.S. Government or Congress. 
  He noted: "The United States has viewed the countries that 
are south of the Rio Grande as one huge hacienda, and it 
believes it can submit these nations to its will." 
  Gonzalez Munoz pointed to the efforts Colombia has made to 
fight drug trafficking and the price it has paid in its fight 
against organized crime, and he added that this is why he 
believes remarks by some U.S. officials are less than 
appropriate. 
  Gonzalez added: "The existence of drug money in the economy 
cannot be denied, but this also happens in the United States." 
  Gabriel Rosas Vega, president of the Association of Coffee 
Exporters, also rejected Senator Kerry's remarks. Rosas 
indicated that the United States has no moral authority to call 
us into question because U.S. banks, both large and small, 
handle drug money. 
<H5>  More Reactions </H5>
  Rosas Vega said "we cannot bite our tongues" and avoid 
saying 
the United States is not morally qualified to speak on the 
subject. 
  Carlos Caballero Argaez, president of the Bank of Foreign 
Trade, noted that the problem "must be examined from its true 
perspective, which is that Colombia's situation cannot be viewed 
only in the light of drug trafficking activities when its 
economy depends on and is rooted in traditional exports of oil, 
coffee, ferronickel, and so on." 
  Last, Labor Minister Jose Elias Melo said that Senator 
Kerry's opinion shows total ignorance of the recent progress of 
the Colombian economy. He stated: "The fact that he has finally 
noticed Colombia's recent strength and development does not mean 
that this progress stems from drug activities; on the contrary, 
it comes from the hard work of Colombian businessmen and 
workers." 
  Melo added that efforts are being made to prevent money 
laundering, and these efforts must be perceived in a better 
light when viewed from abroad.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has said that 
his office "has never intended to tell the United States how its 
judges should try its cases or how to evaluate evidence sent 
there. I have never said that the U.S. Justice Department is 
uncommonly charitable toward drug traffickers." 
  As for U.S. Justice Department officials, De Greiff pointed 
out he has never said that one of them "met clandestinely with a 
drug cartel chief, and I have never made similar charges against 
U.S. executive branch officials or a senator." 
  The prosecutor general argued that neither his review of a 
possible long-term drug legalization program nor his demand that 
industrialized nations--particularly the United States--make 
greater efforts in the fight against drugs was ever intended "to 
discredit U.S. officials, or to tell the U.S. attorney general 
how to enforce the law, much less intend to attribute slanderous 
remarks to her." 
  These statements are included in a 30 March letter De Greiff 
sent to President Cesar Gaviria to explain his position on 
remarks Gaviria made in an interview he granted to this 
newspaper. 
  When asked about whether the executive branch was completely 
independent with regard to drug trafficking in light of 
statements made by the U.S. drug czar and Attorney General Janet 
Reno, both of whom commented on how the Cali Cartel should be 
dealt with, the Colombian head of state replied as follows: 
  "We must understand that judicial cooperation is a very 
difficult process and that the two countries' judicial systems 
are different.... The U.S. Justice Department has significant 
differences with the Prosecutor General's Office. In the past, 
the executive branch also had differences of opinion, but I 
believe we are overcoming these now. Nevertheless, we cannot be 
surprised by this.'' 
  "The president is usually very careful when he issues an 
opinion with regard to U.S. drug trafficking policies. However, 
the Prosecutor General's Office does not always react in the 
same manner. If this happens here, then we must expect to 
receive criticism from over there." 
<H5>  Prosecutor General's Letter </H5>
  In response to President Gaviria's comments, De Greiff sent 
him the following letter: 
  In the 30 March issue of EL TIEMPO newspaper, you said you 
are careful when you comment on U.S. internal policies on 
fighting drug trafficking, but that the Prosecutor General's 
Office is not always careful. It is very clear to me that these 
remarks also insinuate that it is acceptable for U.S. officials 
to express their opinions on our ability to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  Let me tell you that the United States does not behave in 
this manner, because the Prosecutor General's Office--especially 
me--has never intended to tell the United States how its judges 
should try its cases or how to evaluate evidence sent there. I 
have never said that the U.S. Justice Department--much less its 
main representative--is uncommonly charitable toward drug 
traffickers. In addition, we have never claimed that this 
department met clandestinely with a drug cartel chief, and I 
have never made similar charges against U.S. executive branch 
officials or a senator. 
  It seems to me that all of this is very different from 
saying 
the way in which we are waging the war against drug trafficking 
has proven unsuccessful, that we should study the possibility of 
legalizing drugs in the long term to reduce drug traffickers' 
profits, and that drug-consuming countries (especially the 
United States) have failed to do enough to curtail drug 
consumption. In none of these statements, however, did I intend 
to discredit U.S. officials, or to tell the U.S. attorney 
general how to enforce the law, much less intend to attribute 
slanderous remarks to her. 
  So you see, there is a difference! [Algo va, pues, de Pedro 
a 
Pedro]. 
  [signed] Respectfully yours, Gustavo de Greiff

  [Text] There is concern at the Prosecutor General's Office. 
The United States is definitely not sending evidence on drug 
traffickers to Colombian authorities. Although there was no 
official announcement, the truth is that, in practice, the 
sanction is being applied. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office has not received a single 
piece of evidence against Colombian drug traffickers from the 
United States for the past two months. The last evidence 
received was against Julio Fabio Dinol and Miguel Rodriguez 
Orejuela for drug trafficking. 
  According to Francisco Jose Cintura, the acting prosecutor, 
the refusal to send information on drug traffickers is worrisome 
because the evidence sent by the United States has been 
overwhelming and has served to convict 17 individuals. 
  [Begin Cintura recording] The cooperation of the U.S. 
Justice 
Department has been important in consolidating several cases, 
including those of the Ochoa brothers, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin, and 
17 individuals whose extradition was pending when the National 
Constitutional Assembly banned extraditions. The U.S. 
Government should carefully examine the decision, because such a 
negative decision can only benefit drug traffickers. [end 
recording] 
  Particularly in the cases against the Ochoa brothers, the 
United States sent accusations of cocaine trafficking and the 
testimony of U.S. drug traffickers who incriminated them. In 
addition, it sent recordings of telephone conversations 
intercepted by the DEA as evidence against certain Cali Cartel 
members. 
  Although there is concern over the announcement by DEA 
Investigations Director Robert Nieves to suspend the exchange of 
evidence to Colombia, the Prosecutor General's Office not only 
cooperates with the United States but also exchanges evidence 
with Russia, Italy, Mexico, and Peru.

  [Text] The Motilones Indians are among the tribes that 
struggle the hardest to save their identity. The guerrilla 
movements have now surfaced as a formidable enemy. They say 
they are willing to fight the subversives. It took one whole 
day, travelling along dirt roads, canoeing along the Catatumbo 
River, and cutting through the jungle to get to the villages of 
the Caricacha Buquira tribe of the Motilones Bari Indians. 
Almost 300 Indians, whose ancestors go back some 500 years, 
base their economy on fishing, coffee, cocoa, yucca, and wild 
fruits. 
  "TV Today" came here after hearing about reports made by 16 
Indian communities. The Motilones are angry with the guerrillas 
and the white settlers, who have moved onto their historically 
defined reservations. 
  [Begin unidentified Indian chief recording, in dialect 
fading 
to Spanish translation] The settlers have been growing coca. 
The processing waste flows into the river. The guerrillas have 
contaminated the river with oil and there have been no fish in 
the river for the last few years. Fish are the basis of our 
diet. [end recording] 
  The Indians filed a complaint against the Revolutionary 
Armed 
Forces of Colombia and the Army of National Liberation. 
Although there have been no clashes up to now, the Motilones 
Bari Indians threatened to burn the coca plantations they find 
on their lands. There are almost 4,000 Indians living all over 
the Catatumbo region who would enforce this request by the 
Motilones if the government representatives do not offer any 
solutions to the problem.

  [Text] San Jose, 5 Mar [date as received] (NOTIMEX) -- Luis 
Fishman, the Costa Rican government and public security 
minister, said today that the DEA had brought alleged Bolivian 
drug kingpin Edgar Fernandez Lazcano into the country . 
  DEA officials brought Fernandez Lazcano into the country, 
without consulting local authorities, on a private flight on 16 
March, Minister Fishman said at a joint news conference with 
Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation 
Agency (OIJ). 
  Fishman and Guillen ended 12 days of silence when Attorney 
General Jose Maria Tijerino announced that he was initiating an 
investigation on "the mysterious conditions under which the 
South American citizen entered" the country. 
  Bolivian drug officials believe Fernandez Lazcano to be the 
right-hand man of Isaac "Oso" Chavarria's--Bolivia's most 
prominent drug trafficker--who is charged with bribing important 
politicians in that South American country. 
  Fishman said the Bolivian drug trafficker "arrived in Costa 
Rica aboard a U.S. Government plane with registration number 
N55949." 
  The authorities explained that Bolivians do not require a 
visa to enter Costa Rican territory but they asserted that "we 
do not know why (the Costa Rican Government) was not informed of 
this matter." 
  According to the Costa Rican officials, the drug kingpin 
stayed at the luxurious San Jose Palace Hotel accompanied by DEA 
officials and three unidentified Bolivian police officers. 
  Fishman said that "the DEA's actions are a blatant abuse by 
this organization" because they did not report Fernandez 
Lazcano's arrival to Costa Rican authorities. 
  Fishman said that Roberto Mendez, director of the Drug 
Investigation and Control Center, has requested an explanation 
of DEA activities from the DEA head in this country. The 
minister also warned that "we will not allow any more of their 
arbitrary actions." 
  Fishman revealed that Fernandez Lazcano had left for the 
United States, escorted by DEA officials, on TACA Airlines 
flight 40 last Sunday. 
  The Costa Rican officials said DEA officials had taken 
Fernandez from Bolivia to Panama, where local authorities denied 
him entry because he did not have a visa. They thus decided to 
bring him to Costa Rica, where Bolivians do not need a visa. 
  The minister justified his office's previous silence on the 
case by saying that "Fernandez is a great witness who apparently 
knows a lot about the ties between drug traffickers and 
politicians in his country. That is why we could not reveal the 
details of his stay in Costa Rica."

  [Text] The U.S. military man who died while playing with a 
hand grenade had taken three types of drugs, an autopsy has 
revealed. 
  Dr. Juan Mateo Llort, director of the Forensic Medicine 
Institute, has confirmed that a toxicological examination on the 
body of U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Julio Ramon Rivera, who died 
early Sunday, reveals he was under the influence of three 
illegal drugs when he pulled the pin on the grenade that killed 
him and wounded four other people. 
  Based on this conclusion, Dr. Llort will ask the U.S. 
Embassy 
in El Salvador to perform drug tests on all Embassy officials. 
  Dr. Llort said Rivera died from multiple trauma caused by 
the 
explosion of the grenade, which he handled recklessly. 
  [Begin Llort recording] Only a person under the influence of 
drugs could have played with a live grenade, thinking it was a 
toy. The three drugs found were 25 nanograms of marijuana, 276 
nanograms of methamphetamine, and 440 nanograms of 
phenobarbital--a considerable quantity. [end recording] 
  The official U.S. Embassy report says Lt. Col. Rivera had 
gone to the National Civilian Police in the Zacamil neighborhood 
to meet his bodyguards who were being released. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified speaker] He was meeting some 
of his bodyguards. That is when he received the grenade, which 
exploded. 
  [Dr. Llort] Routine toxicological tests should be performed 
on these kinds of people, who should be setting an example for 
the rest of the country. [end recording] 
  Lt. Col. Rivera was second in command of the U.S. military 
advisers who have been in the country for the past two years. 
His body was flown in a C-130 plane to Puerto Rico, where he 
resided.

<F P=106> [Report by Edwin Gongora from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Drug expert Carlos Aviles reported that U.S. Embassy 
personnel are involved in a drug network in El Salvador. Aviles 
added that the incident which resulted in the death of 
Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Rivera can only be explained by his 
emotional state as Rivera's autopsy revealed that he had used a 
considerable amount of marijuana and meta-amphetamines 
[metanfetaminas]. The drug expert said meta-amphetamines are 
only produced in the United States, thus the officer had brought 
it into the country and committed a serious crime by doing so. 
  [Begin Aviles recording] How does this make the U.S. Army 
and 
Government look? How do they look when one of their soldiers 
brings meta-amphetamines from the United States to our country? 
Drug consumption....[pauses] Marijuana is a drug that Rivera 
could have bought here or in Guatemala, but it is still a very 
serious crime. This shows that our government must take a 
stronger stand and demand that foreign personnel in our country 
meet some basic requirements. [end recording] 
  Aviles thinks our nation is not respected because we do not 
require members of U.S. military delegations to pass drug tests. 
  [Begin Aviles recording] I have said this for several 
months. 
I have said that we must stricter. Nationalism is not something 
found only in songs. It requires us to ensure that our 
Constitution and laws are respected. Unfortunately, nobody has 
paid any attention to me. Today we sadly see how another 
scandal has erupted that has shown not only that the officer 
used marijuana and meta- amphetamines but that meta-amphetamines 
are powerful, synthetic stimulants that make cocaine look like 
breath mints. [end recoding] 
  According to Aviles, U.S. diplomats should practice what 
they 
preach in U.S. counternarcotics efforts because this is not the 
first time U.S. Embassy personnel have been involved in 
drug-related incidents.

  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police [PNC], has said he expects the U.S. Embassy to 
publish a report on the death of Lieutenant Colonel Julio Ramon 
Rivera, a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. [words indistinct] 
his police organization already issued an initial report on the 
incident based on results of an autopsy conducted on the body of 
the U.S. soldier. 
  [Begin Monterrey recording] U.S. investigators are here to 
collect as much information as possible. We will now wait 
because we already issued our report. The decision of what to 
do is now in their hands. [end recording] 
  Last Wednesday Robert Adams, chief of investigations of the 
Southern Command, which is headquarted in Panama, [words 
indistinct] commentaries on the incident after requesting the 
respective analyses from the Legal Medicine Institute. Julio 
Ramon Rivera died early last Sunday after he detonated a 
fragmentation grenade while under the influence of drugs. The 
explosion seriously injured three PNC agents. They should be 
compensated, because they will not be able to work normally, 
Monterrey pointed out: 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey, in progress] ...collaborators 
of justice. We can only do so much, but we cannot go beyond our 
limits. The justice system [words indistinct] or the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Monterrey] Yes, we talked yesterday with our Legal 
Department. I requested an appointment with the ambassador on 
Friday to talk about that. I think this will move ahead. A 
U.S. Embassy official yesterday afternoon [words indistinct] 
with me. We think that this is on the right track. [end 
recording] 
  Jose Maria Monterrey rejected claims from Rivera's relatives 
who said the U.S. soldier had not consumed drugs, as confirmed 
by the director of the Legal Medicine Institute, who based his 
opinion on an autopsy conducted by Salvadoran forensic surgeons.

  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police [PNC], reported that the U.S. officer who died 
after detonating a hand grenade that also wounded two members of 
the PNC, was under the influence of drugs. Monterrey added that 
the accident, which occurred at the PNC station in the Zacamil 
neighborhood, occurred after the officer threatened to try and 
reclaim the confiscated weapons. 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey] They say that they arrived at 
the station after arresting the bodyguards of Colonel Rivera for 
drunken misconduct. They were firing their weapons, I believe, 
so they were arrested. They were taken to the police station. 
They said they were U.S. Embassy personnel, so we called the 
U.S. Embassy, after which the colonel arrived. We turned over 
the hand grenade and the weapons that had been confiscated from 
the two detained bodyguards. He then began to handle the 
grenade. At first they thought it was an accident. That was 
later ruled out because of the high amount of drugs involved. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The U.S. Embassy report says he 
thought it was a toy. [Words indistinct] could it be, given the 
state he was in because of the drugs, that he might have used 
the grenade to threaten those present? 
  [Monterrey] Apparently he was a little arrogant when he 
arrived. There was some of that with our people. You must 
remember that they always try to look down on our people. 
However, there is no doubt that this was caused by an excessive 
amount of drugs. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Monterrey] We are going to try and make this the highest 
amount they have ever paid in compensation. One of the boys is 
blind, and the other will lose one eye. 
  [Reporter] Are these the only wounded? 
  [Monterrey] Just these two policemen were wounded. 
Fortunately all the others fled when they saw him playing with 
the grenade in his condition. [end recording] 
  The PNC director added that they will ask for the highest 
possible compensation for the wounded policemen. It was 
reported that Col. Julio Ramon Rivera, who died in the incident, 
was a security officer at the U.S. Embassy in our country.

confronting this problem, his government will sign cooperation 
agreements against drug trafficking with the United States, 
Great Britain, and Colombia. Commenting on Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria's election as OAS secretary general, he expresssed 
his confidence that his efforts as head of the regional 
organization will be of great value. He said his visit to 
Colombia will strengthen bilateral trade relations and invited

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 8 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina said today that the alleged plot to 
assassinate him, hatched by fellow Honduran Luis Hernandez Sosa 
in complicity with three Nicaraguans, is "a case of gangsterism 
and drug trafficking." 
  Speaking briefly with reporters in the city of San Pedro 
Sula 
in northern Honduras, Reina pointed out that the conspirators 
initially intended to set a factory on fire but later thought it 
"a better deal to assassinate the president." "A white book is 
going to be opened to outline in detail everything that has 
happened in this case and the people will be informed," the 
Honduran president said. 
  Reina reiterated that this is a case of "gangsters or drug 
traffickers who came to Honduras to burn down a paint factory 
and then perpetrate a kidnapping, but it occurred to them that 
it might be a better deal to kill the Honduran president." 
  Reina's statements corroborated local media reports to the 
effect that Hernandez Sosa, who yesterday surrendered to the 
authorities accompanied by human rights leaders, is involved in 
drug trafficking. Hernandez Sosa, 30, was turned over to the 
police in Tegucigalpa, who were unaware of his whereabouts, 
after appearing in court escorted by members of the (government) 
National Human Rights Ombudsmanship. 
  The alleged conspirator, who is being held in a special cell 
at the National Penitentiary and under strict surveillance by 
Army troops, pointed out: "It is stupid to think that I wanted 
to murder the president." In a brief message he sent to the 
media today, Hernandez Sosa requested that his family be 
informed that he is well, has faith in God, and will emerge 
unblemished from this case. 
  The newspaper LA PRENSA reported today that Hernandez Sosa 
allegedly hatched the plot against the president to "slip away" 
from a group of alleged drug traffickers whom he owed money. 
According to this report, Hernandez put the plan together with 
an unspecified quantity of money given to him by cocaine 
addicts, who were now demanding their money. 
  A government source today told ACAN-EFE that there is proof 
of Hernandez Sosa's drug trafficking activities, which will help 
resolve the alleged plot against President Reina, about which 
the Honduran authorities were notified on 13 March by the 
Nicaraguan Government. 
  Meanwhile, two of the three Nicaraguans implicated in the 
plot have been arrested by the Nicaraguan police, who have not 
made any disclosures regarding the depth of their involvement in 
the plot. The detainees are Luis Rene Quintero, who alerted the 
Nicaraguan authorities to the plot and helped thwart it, and 
Santiago Rivas who has denied any involvement. Meanwhile, Roger 
Arguello's whereabouts are unknown. 
  Honduran Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua said 
last Wednesday that the investigation of the plot has been 
"dashed" because of the information that has been leaked by the 
press. 
  Certain opposition politicians have not dismissed the 
possibility that the alleged plot against Reina is a "smoke 
screen" to distract the people's attention from the country's 
economic problems.

  [Excerpts] Tegucigalpa, 8 Apr [date as received] (ACAN-EFE) 
-- Honduran citizen Luis Hernandez Sosa has denied being the 
mastermind of an alleged plot to assassinate President Carlos 
Roberto Reina, and he has told the press: "I am innocent and not 
an assassin." 
  Hernandez Sosa, 30, turned himself in on Thursday to 
Honduran 
judicial authorities through the government's Office of the 
National Human Rights Ombudsman. [passage omitted] 
  When reporters asked him about his relationship with three 
Nicaraguans, Hernandez Sosa said: "I have no contact with 
Nicaraguans or anyone else. I only have contact with God." 
  President Reina described the alleged assassination plot as 
an act of "gangsterism and drug trafficking." 
  "No one has accused me. I am not an assassin, and tomorrow I 
will clarify everything," Hernandez Sosa said before being 
admitted to the Tegucigalpa Penal Center, where he was placed in 
a special cell under tight security by Army personnel. [passage 
omitted] 
  A presidential spokesman told ACAN-EFE, "it is absurd to 
think that the president could be used as a smokescreen," and he 
underscored that the plan "existed." The source added, "We have 
information that Hernandez Sosa is involved in drug trafficking, 
and this will allow us to clarify the situation for all of the 
Honduran people." 
  Hernandez Sosa has six days, beginning on Friday, to respond 
in court to the charges against him in a case in which Honduran 
and Nicaraguan authorities are working jointly.

  [Excerpts] Morelia, Michoacan--"There is no resurgence of 
drug trafficking in the country, and the recent confrontations 
between Federal Judicial Police personnel and `narco' rings show 
that it is being attacked and fought." This assertion was made 
here today by the republic's attorney general, Diego Valades. 
The official claimed that the drug traffic has not infiltrated 
the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], 
remarking: "We shall fight to prevent that." 
  He made these comments after a private meeting with Governor 
Ausencio Chavez and officials from both the state attorney's 
office and the federal department itself. The meeting was held 
to assess the effort being expended against the drug traffic in 
Michoacan. [passage omitted] 
  He also announced the initiation, within the next few days, 
of a national system for complaints and charges against the PGR, 
"because we are striving to combat impunity and abuses, which 
will not be allowed in the department. Also, with that system, 
the citizens will be able to contact us free of charge to report 
abuses." 
  Subsequently, Diego Valades also denied that there were 
"informers" in the Federal Judicial Police, claiming that the 
municipal policemen assigned to that force are only cooperating 
with the institution. "However, if they commit a crime, they are 
punished according to law, just as the agents in that department 
are." [passage omitted] 
  On another subject, the attorney general refused to give 
statistics on the number of personnel killed in action during 
recent months in their confrontations with the "narco" rings. 
Nor did he specify the area in hectares that was confiscated 
from "narcos" in the country because it was being used to grow 
marijuana. [passage omitted] 
  He claimed that good results have been accrued in the 
permanent campaign against the drug traffic in Michoacan, 
praising the work done by the Mexican Army in this respect. 
  Concluding the interview, he declared that the action 
against 
drug planting, cultivation, and marketing will be intensified. 
In support of this, PGR local offices have been opened in the 
municipalities of Huetamo and Apatzingan, where the incidence of 
crimes against health is high.

  [Text] Tijuana, B.C., 6 March--Today, the Office of the 
Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] issued arrest warrants 
against 16 persons, including the state's deputy prosecutor of 
justice, an agent from the Public Prosecutor's Office, four of 
the force's group chiefs, and a Municipal Public Safety 
commander. They are implicated in the shooting on 3 March in 
which Federal Judicial Police Commander Alejandro Castaneda 
Andrade was killed. 
  At a press conference (postponed four times), the deputy 
prosecutor for local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera 
Morales, was accompanied by the PGR's director of preliminary 
investigations, Juan Alberto Carbajal. They announced that the 
officials and State Judicial Police agents implicated had 
protected the escape of Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias "El 
Mayel," who has taken control of the Arellano Felix brothers' 
ring. 
  Based on the reconstruction of the incidents, the federal 
agents were attacked to prevent them from discovering the 
identity of an individual who was being watched, and to prevent 
his capture. 
  The official added that 11 persons have already been 
remanded, including the state's deputy prosecutor of justice, 
Sergio Ortiz Lara, and the agent of the Public Prosecutor's 
Office for the common jurisdiction, Juan Carlos Guerrero. 
  The others under arrest are Javier Arce Garcia, Pedro Muniz 
Resendiz Flores, Gustavo Aguilar Villasenor, Humberto Iribe 
Obeso, Jose Gallegos Astorga, and Juan Carlos Aguilar Renteria. 
All are civilians, and assistants of members of the State 
Judicial Police, who are accused of homicide, aggravated 
injuries, breach of trust, gangsterism against authorized 
agents, carrying firearms exclusively for Army use, and 
usurpation of functions. 
  In the same legal circumstances but not yet under arrest are 
Julio Cesar Guzman Castillo and Gilberto Vega Hernandez, drivers 
of municipal patrol car 497, accused of injuries; Juan Jesus 
Hernandez Tejeda, a State Judicial Police member; and the La 
Mesa group chiefs, Mauricio Sanchez Zavala, Esteban Cebreros 
Zavala, Jaime Valderrabano, and Julio Cesar J. Guzman; as well 
as Municipal Public Safety Commander Antonio Cano. 
  They were remanded for abuse of authority, escape of 
prisoners in a gang, and acts against the administration of 
justice. 
  The state's attorney, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, who was 
cleared of all liability, remarked: "Just because there are bad 
members of the force, there is no need to discredit everyone." 
  In the case of Juan Carlos Guerrero, it was specified that 
he 
had permitted inmates to escape when they were introduced to 
him. However, it is not yet known who they were. As for Ortiz 
Lara, he appeared with an armed group and argued with one of the 
captives. He was taken away, and his whereabouts are as yet 
unknown. 
  Ortiz Lara appeared before the authorities with amparo, 28 
hours after having been summoned for the first time, and after 
having received four additional summonses. As a result, he has 
not been apprehended either.

  [Text] Reynosa, Tamaulipas, 2 March--The director, deputy 
director, and three commanders of security at the No. 2 prison 
are under investigation by the Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic to establish their liability for the escape of the 
drug trafficker, Emeterio Ayala Garcia. This announcement was 
made today by the agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office, Juan Carlos Mendoza Arguelles. The prosecutor refused to 
go into detail on the investigation, or to disclose the 
identities of the persons interrogated. However, it was 
established that they include the warden, Genaro Agustin 
Sepulveda Lopez; the deputy director, whose identity was 
concealed; and the security commanders, Fernando Gonzalez 
Hernandez, Guadalupe Guadarrama, and Fernando Miramontes. 
  The prison officials are not officially detained, but it was 
indicated that, if they prove responsible for the escape, arrest 
warrants might be issued against them. 
  Meanwhile, at the Prisons Directorate in Ciudad Victoria, 
its 
head, Francisco Castellanos de la Garza, refused to be 
interviewed to provide information on the escape. The 
authorities have not yet established how and when the drug 
trafficker managed to escape without being seen by the guard 
personnel. 
  Ayala Garcia's disappearance was not announced until Monday 
afternoon, when the roll was called. He was serving a 17-year 
sentence imposed by the seventh district judge, Juan Bonilla 
Pizano, for crimes against health.

  [Text] The drug traffic phenomenon in Mexico is not a risk 
to the national security. This claim was made by Raul Campos 
Rabago, representing the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic at Mar del Plata, Argentina, where he is attending the 
meeting of the Inter-American Committee for Control of Drugs and 
Drug Abuse [CICAD]. 
  Campos Rabago, commissioner of the National Institute To 
Combat Drugs [INCD], told delegates from 24 countries serving on 
the aforementioned committee that, despite his previous remark, 
"The drug traffic is still not just threatening, but also 
inflicting daily harm on the health and welfare of societies." 
  Participating as Mexico's representative at the committee's 
meeting, which is being held in the Argentine province of Mar 
del Plata, the official stressed, on this occasion, that 
President Salinas de Gortari's administration is aware of this 
situation. Hence, since the beginning of his term, he has given 
the battle against drugs and drug addiction a priority status on 
the government's agenda. 
  He added that the 1989-94 National Program To Combat Drugs 
includes action for eradication, interception, repression, and 
rehabilitation, thus dealing with the phenomenon as a whole. 
Campos Rabago explained that this has been made possible by the 
reinforcement of the Mexican institutions responsible for 
combating crimes against health in all their forms. 
  He also noted that the National Institute To Combat Drugs is 
the agency charged with coordinating the action taken in this 
area by the federal and state governments, and by private 
institutions, serving as a central catalyst for executing the 
national strategy, through the Planning Center for Drug Control 
(Cendro). 
  The INCD commissioner stressed that, although considerable 
progress has been made, "the fact that the criminal associations 
involved in the drug traffic are increasing their capacity to 
evade each of our countries' coercive measures more every day 
impels us to extend the battle not only to curb the supply and 
the illicit trafficking, but also, primarily, to check the 
demand. This can be achieved by preventing improper use of drugs 
and psychotropic substances, and by rehabilitating addicts." 
  Attending this 15th regular session of the CICAD were 
representatives from the United States, Venezuela, Colombia, 
Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, Brazil, Bolivia, and the 
Central American countries.

  [Text] In fighting drugs, unilateral action is insufficient 
for dealing successfully with the phenomenon. Therefore, 
international cooperation is being sought as the only means of 
consolidating an effective barrier against a supranational type 
of problem. This statement was made yesterday by Raul Campos 
Rabago, commissioner of the PGR's [Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic] [National] Institute To Combat Drugs. 
He was participating for the second time in the sessions of the 
Inter-American Committee for Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse 
[CICAD], being held in Mar del Plata, Argentina. 
  Addressing representatives from North, Central, and South 
America, and the Antilles, the Mexican official specified 
Mexico's achievements in this respect during 1993, describing 
them as a record in the battle against the drug traffic. He 
reported confiscations of nearly 46 tons of cocaine, 129 kg of 
opium gum, 27 kg of morphine, 26 kg of heroin, and a ton of 
poppy seed. 
  He also cited approximately six tons of marijuana seed, 500 
tons of marijuana, 23,000 units of psychotropic substances, more 
than 2,000 land vehicles, 24 aircraft, and six vessels seized. 
Moreover, five clandestine laboratories for processing and 
refining various illicit substances or narcotic precursors were 
dismantled. Over 200,000 marijuana plantations and approximately 
160 poppy crops were seized as well; and 18,000 nationals and 
75,000 foreigners involved in committing crimes against health 
were captured. 
  In the juridical-penal area, Campos Rabago remarked that the 
most significant action taken in the context of the national 
antidrug policy was the amendment to the regulations of the 
Organic Law for the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic. It created the National Institute To Combat Drugs, 
assigning a sector of the Federal Judicial Police to that 
decentralized agency, to achieve an ethical, professional police 
force devoted exclusively to fighting the drug traffic. 
  At the same time, he gave a reminder that, early this year, 
several articles of the Federal District Penal Code pertaining 
to both the common jurisdiction and the entire republic were 
amended, given additions, or repealed. Including Articles 193 to 
199, and 201, regulations pertaining to crimes against health 
were established, to provide for more severe punishment. 
Addressing the representatives of the CICAD's 24 member nations, 
and those of the observer states, he stressed that all the 
national and international action taken to combat drugs is 
reducing the power of the criminal associations. 
  Nevertheless, he noted that, to deal with the problem with 
modern, really effective methods, "it seems essential to us that 
all countries have a juridical frame of reference, a national 
program, and a central coordinating and executive organ. Hence, 
we take the liberty of urging those who have not yet done so to 
ratify and, if pertinent, sign the United Nations Convention of 
1988 against the illicit trafficking of drugs and psychotropic 
substances." 
  He explained that, with that expedient, "many of our nations 
have taken steps to harmonize their legislation, which is an 
essential factor for dealing with the problem on a regional and 
international scale, in a coordinated manner. This will make it 
possible to accrue increasingly positive results in this battle, 
which can be won only through the political will and concerted 
action of all nations." 
  Raul Campos Rabago emphasized that, in the case of the 
Mexican experience, "our country has always stressed that the 
causes and not merely the effects of the drug traffic must be 
attacked." In this forum, he reiterated Mexico's conviction that 
it was imperative to promote alternative development of 
underprivileged rural areas, where extreme poverty has fostered 
the illicit crops as a means of subsistence. 
  He continued: "In my country, great importance is attached 
to 
suitable planning and regional coordination of the strategies 
for combating drugs and drug addiction. The aim is to reduce 
consumption and, hence, the demand for and illicit trafficking 
of drugs and psychotropic substances, as well as the associated 
activities. 
  "It is highly desirable to promote the establishment of 
coordinated action in the interior and among the various 
geographical areas comprising the American Continent, always 
based on the principle of respect for national sovereignty and 
jurisdictions."

  [Text] In simultaneous operations conducted in Durango and 
Guerrero States yesterday, Federal Judicial Police 
counternarcotics agents destroyed over 600,000 poppy plants 
growing on areas totaling 60,000 square meters. These 
operations, carried out as part of the permanent campaign to 
eradicate drug crops that is under way nationwide, were reported 
by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic yesterday. 
  The institution of federal justice noted that its local 
office in Durango State had reported the manual destruction by 
federal agents of two poppy plantations on an area of 10,000 
square meters in the community of Metates, part of the 
municipality of Santiago Papasquiaro. 
  It added that an average of 10,000 plants with bulbs ready 
for scoring, and, consequently, for collection of opium gum, 
were detected on that site. 
  The Attorney General's Office announced that the Guerrero 
local office had reported the discovery of a plantation of the 
same drug in a ravine called "Paseo de la Noche Triste," in the 
vicinity of the settlement of Polixtepec, in the municipality of 
Leonardo Bravo. Covering approximately 40,000 square meters, its 
plants were also ready for scoring, and for procuring opium gum. 
The latter is the base for heroin, a drug considered 10 times 
more powerful than cocaine. 
  The office added that, according to estimates made by the 
federal agents, approximately 400,000 poppy plants were growing 
on the site. 
  It also noted that, in a simultaneous operation carried out 
in the same community, Federal Judicial Police agents discovered 
and eradicated another poppy plantation growing on an area of 
10,000 square meters and containing an average of 100,000 bushes. 
  The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, which was informed 
of 
the aforementioned cases, claimed that on the latter farm, about 
300 meters from the first one, a man identified as Victor 
Gonzalez Luna was arrested. He was the owner of the land and the 
one guarding the crops. 
  Finally, it was reported that, based on preliminary 
investigation 18-CHI-94, Gonzalez Luna was remanded to the 
pertinent judicial authorities as a person presumed guilty of 
crimes against health in the form of poppy growing, and any 
others that might result.

campaign against poppy and marijuana growing throughout the 
republic, because this is the period of the greatest incidence, 
given the anticipated rainy season. 
  "Regional Operation 1994" was put into effect in the areas 
with the greatest prevalence, including Sonora, Chihuahua, 
Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guerrero, and 
Oaxaca States. A total of 9,700 members of the armed institution 
are participating. 
  This contingent is equipped with 250 field vehicles, 17 
helicopters, and seven small Mexican Air Force planes, as well 
as Army regulation weapons. 
  It also has special facilities for destroying plantations, 
including defoliants, trained dogs, flame throwers and, in some 
cases, tractors. 
  Furthermore, as the National Defense Secretariat reported, 
the campaign is not limited to those states, but extends 
throughout the country, because military personnel will be 
conducting it in their zonal and regional jurisdictions. 
  One of the important features is the surveillance at 
airports 
and on the network of roads and highways. For this purpose, the 
forces are backed by the Federal Judicial Police, whose mission 
is to detect the drug traffickers' safe houses and activities in 
all parts of the republic, so as to keep the military forces 
informed of them.

  [Excerpts] A total of six tons and 875 kg of packed 
marijuana, 19 kg and 650 grams of seed of the same drug, and 
seven kg of poppy seed, with a total market value exceeding 7 
million new pesos, were seized yesterday by agents from the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR]. They were 
engaged in antidrug operations in 10 of the nation's states, 
which enabled them to capture 21 presumed drug dealers, 
including a Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agent. 
  During the activities, the federal agents under orders from 
Commander Adrian Carrera confiscated 13 automotive vehicles used 
to transport drugs, and five heavy caliber firearms. 
Concurrently, the PGR personnel destroyed a marijuana and poppy 
plantation located on an area of 50,000 square meters and 
containing about 450,000 plants. It was situated in the 
mountains of Guerrero State. 
  This accumulation of drugs was intended for the narcotics 
markets in the states of California, Texas, and Arizona, and 
represented millions of doses. 
  The department's local office in Baja California, headed by 
Jose Arturo Ochoa Palacios, reported that, in a simultaneous 
operation conducted with public safety personnel in Tijuana, the 
PJF seized one ton, 348 kg, and 600 grams of marijuana 
discovered on the streets of Guadalupe Victoria in that town's 
Colonia Guerrero. Arrested in the operation were Samuel Mendoza 
Valdez and Ubaldo Campa Mejia who, according to preliminary 
investigation 561-94, were waiting for other members of their 
criminal organization to arrive with a vehicle to smuggle the 
drugs into the United States. 
  In that same state, in the vicinity of Tijuana, a shipment 
of 
cannabis indica weighing one ton and 74 kg was intercepted. It 
was being carried by Gonzalo Banuelos Montano on a fifth wheel 
type truck, hidden under hundreds of drums of gypsum from 
Tonala, Jalisco. [passage omitted] 
  Another ton, 236 kg, and 900 grams of marijuana was seized 
by 
federal agents in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where they arrested 
Miguel Angel Loa Rodriguez, Gabriel Melchor Ontiveros, and 
Griselda Garcia Nunez. They were carrying the drugs in the false 
bottom of a platform installed on a pickup truck. Confiscated 
with the drugs were two rifles, a 22 and a .410 caliber, as well 
as a 22 caliber revolver, concealed in the back of the vehicle's 
cab. Presumed to have been heading for San Antonio, Texas, the 
subjects were captured on a trail near the Rio Grande. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the state representative, Joel Ortiz Hernandez, 
in the municipality of Tecpan de Galeana, located in Guerrero's 
sierra area, approximately 450,000 marijuana and poppy plants 
were destroyed and incinerated.

<F P=106> [Article by Judyth Guevara Santibanez] </F>
  [Text] Overall drug consumption rose from three to nine 
percent in the country's border zone, where 5.3 percent of the 
total population (nearly 200,000 persons) is addicted to some 
type of stimulant. This was revealed by a poll taken by the 
Health Secretariat's General Directorate of Epidemiology. 
  At a press conference, Roberto Tapia, general director for 
that field in the department, and Rafael Velasco, coordinator of 
the National Council Against Addictions, established the fact 
that the sample taken in Monterrey, Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, and 
Matamoros indicates higher consumption among the adult 
population than the youth, and among males than females. 
  Of the 200,000 consumers, only 11.4 percent are between ages 
12 and 18: in other words, eight adults for each adolescent, and 
five males for each female. The drug most consumed is marijuana, 
followed by cocaine and, to a lesser extent, heroin, inhalants, 
and hallucinogens. 
  Indicating the figures on overall drug consumption in the 
aforementioned towns, the specialists explained that Tijuana, 
with a record of 10.1 percent, is the town with the highest 
rate; whereas Monterrey, with 2.8 percent, is the one with the 
lowest incidence. On the other hand, Ciudad Juarez stands at 8.9 
percent; and Matamoros, at 5.8 percent. 
  Both specialists gave a reminder that, five years ago, a 
poll 
of this type was taken, and that similar methods were used in 
the current survey. This made it possible to learn the trend in 
drug consumption during the past five years. 
  In this connection, they noted that, in Ciudad Juarez, drug 
use rose from 3 to 9 percent; in Matamoros, it doubled; in 
Tijuana alone it was 20 percent; and in Monterrey, it showed a 
constant rate. 
  The increase observed in Ciudad Juarez is due to consumption 
of all drugs, primarily cocaine, the use of which quintupled 
during the past five years. In this locality, marijuana use 
quadrupled, and that of heroin and other inhalants tripled. In 
the case of hallucinogens, the demand was 1.5 times greater than 
the rate reported in 1988. 
  As for Matamoros, the increase was due mainly to an almost 
100 percent rise in marijuana and cocaine use, causing this 
district to become the largest consumer of inhalable substances. 
The increase was 1.6 times larger than between 1988 and 1993. 
  In the case of Tijuana, the increments were due to cocaine 
use, which rose 60 percent, and that of marijuana, with a 20 
percent rise. In Monterrey, no variations were noted in the 
prevalence of consumption. Marijuana use predominated, and there 
was a decline in the consumption of other substances. 
  With regard to the educational level of addicts, Roberto 
Tapia and Rafael Velasco noted that the majority have basic 
primary and secondary level schooling. The population using 
marijuana and cocaine is fundamentally male. 
<H5>  Consumption of Medical Drugs </H5>
  As for the consumption of medical drugs, the poll taken by 
the Health Secretariat's General Directorate of Epidemiology 
reveals that the total prevalence on the northern border 
averaged 15 percent. The rates were 17.2 percent in Ciudad 
Juarez, 15.8 in Matamoros, 14.8 in Tijuana, and 14.1 in 
Monterrey. 
  The investigation shows that the use of medications without 
a 
doctor's prescription is greater in Ciudad Juarez, whereas in 
Monterrey only 16 of every 100 persons reported this occurrence. 
  In conclusion, the medical report claims that, of all the 
pharmaceuticals used, the largest percentage is represented by 
the group of nervous system depressants (tranquilizers), with 
8.6 percent. They are followed by opiates (analgesics, 
narcotics), with 4.9 percent; and other sedatives and 
stimulants, recorded at 3.0 percent, respectively. 
  The Health Secretariat's epidemiology director and the 
coordinator of the National Council Against Addiction stressed 
that there was a fourfold increase in consumption of medical 
drugs between 1988 (the date of the last sampling) and 1993. 
  Although the growing use of these substances is 
intensifying, 
the specialists emphasized that, "fortunately," Mexico has not 
yet reached the prevalence occurring in countries like the 
United States. There, the results of the pertinent polls, taken 
in 1990, indicated that 10 percent of the total population had 
consumed marijuana during the previous year. This figure is not 
comparable to the one reported on Mexico's northern border: only 
1.2 percent. 
  Roberto Tapia and Rafael Velasco concluded by stating that 
the situation is similar in the case of cocaine use because, 
whereas in the neighboring country to the north 3 percent of the 
population consumes the drug, in Mexico only 1 percent of the 
zone's population used it during the previous year.

  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for 
the United People political alliance, yesterday called for 
compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties during a meeting 
with U.S. congressmen who advocate U.S. military presence in 
Panama beyond the year 2000. 
  "Compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties is the most 
advisable thing for the United States and Panama," Perez 
Balladares told U.S. Congressmen Phil Crane and Howard Phillips, 
who are holding talks in Panama to promote a law before the U.S. 
Congress to extend the U.S. military presence in Panama after 31 
December 1999. 
  Perez Balladares said his government would be "willing to 
hold talks" if the United States should request discussions on 
defense issues and on a U.S. military presence beyond the year 
2000. 
  The United People candidate said, "We held very frank 
talks." 
He added that times have changed and currently "our interests 
and the interests of the United States are focused on the war 
against drugs and drug trafficking." 
  Perez Balladares said drugs are causing havoc in Panama, 
adding that, if he wins the 8 May elections, he will ask 
neighboring countries, specifically Costa Rica and Colombia, "to 
establish a united Latin American front to fight drugs." The 
struggle against drugs, the presidential candidate added, must 
be based on mutual respect that must prevail among free, 
independent, and sovereign countries. 
  Perez Balladares' meeting with Congressmen Crane and 
Phillips, who were accompanied by about 20 people, took place in 
the afternoon in the Blue Room of the Continental Hotel.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Arrieta: "Pretty Sight?"] </F>
  [Text] No one in Huallaga could doubt that the capture of 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias "Vaticano," has considerably 
reduced the drug trafficking activity in the zone. Both 
travelers and local residents comment on it. However, it would 
be unrealistic to think that, just because the "chief of all 
churches"--firms--(hence the name, "Vaticano") is behind bars, 
they will stop operating. 
  Similarly, the fact that "La Catedral" (Campanilla) is now 
virtually closed, owing to the suspension of flights at its 
famous airport, and that the chief and his brothers have been 
captured, does not mean that the activity has disappeared. It 
has simply been transferred. 
  And in what direction has this "strategic withdrawal" been 
aimed? SI confirmed this week that the drug traffic's new church 
in the jungle is located in Bellavista. A small settlement 
situated midway between Tarapoto and Juanjui, Bellevista is now 
the site on which the chiefs of the leading firms are operating. 
And, as Campanilla was during its best times, it is impregnable. 
  As evidence of this, on Friday, 25 February, a military 
counternarcotics operation intended to capture the number one 
man after "Vaticano's" downfall, namely, Waldo Vargas Arias, 
alias "El Ministro," failed. 
  The latter, just as "Vaticano" did previously, shows up only 
sporadically in Bellavista. He does not need to be there 
full-time to supervise the work, for which he has his aides, 
such as "El Baron" (who was captured in Friday's operation), the 
son of "Mosca Loca" [Crazy Fly], and other major firm chiefs 
located there. And they are operating, which is why SI was in 
the locality this week. People still recall the years when 
"Vaticano" operated in Campanilla with the protection and 
complicity of the Armed Forces, and without anyone making a 
comment. The following is an exclusive account of how the 
country's leading drug trafficking firms are operating in 
Bellavista, with the names of those assisting them: 
<H5>  All Routes </H5>
  What most attracts the attention of the traveler arriving in 
(or passing through) Bellavista is the intense movement on its 
streets. In the square, in the market, in every bar or shop, or 
on the endless rugged paths to houses, there are people (mostly 
men) conversing, purchasing, and making deals. That is why this 
small settlement appears to be housing more inhabitants than it 
really has: The visitors, who can spend hours in the locality, 
double the Bellavista population's numbers. 
  The odd part of it is that, despite so many people and so 
much movement, there are no crowds, nor anything of the sort. 
The reason is that they all fit and are distributed comfortably 
on Bellavista's four levels. 
  A hill to the right of the town (coming from the direction 
of 
Tarapoto) is what expands its premises with four "levels." And 
each of them also serves as a link in the chain established for 
moving drugs in Bellavista. 
  The heart (at least the urban one) of the town is situated 
on 
the first level: main square, church, market, and truck stop. 
  It is ostensibly a peaceful jungle town: young people 
sitting 
in comfortable rockers at the doors of houses and bars, 
listening to music while holding small glasses of beer. 
  Suddenly, something in the atmosphere indicates a warning: 
there are suspicious looks and a slow movement of hands toward 
the bags under the rockers holding small machine guns. The 
settlers know than when the henchmen think that they have 
detected an "infiltrated" person (from the DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration] or the police), they either chase them shooting, 
or "stand in the way." 
  At one particular point, a red Toyota crosses the street. It 
is "El Baron's" car. No one moves; the chief is passing by. 
  Two blocks from the main square, in a direction opposite the 
hill, lies the river. The dock used for travel on the 
swift-running Huallaga is located there, waiting for the trucks 
loaded with drugs. They must carry them to La Union, where there 
is a clandestine airport. The flights leave from there, bound 
for Colombia. A boat carries the shipment to the other side of 
the river, where another truck is waiting to take it to its 
destination. 
  Most of the drugs leaving Bellavista come from Collpa, Dos 
de 
Mayo, Eslabon, Tabalosos, Sacachimonte, Pachiza, Sacachini, 
Shanan, Huicungo, Saposoa, Tres Unidos, Piscuyacu, and 
Campanilla itself. 
  They arrive on countless routes. That is why the drivers of 
the double-cab trucks carrying passengers, which are the ones 
also transporting drugs, are known as "route men." One of them 
revealed to SI that the rate for transporting one kg of drugs 
delivered in Bellavista averages $20. The transportation is 
achieved with no problems, because all the police inspectors 
have been properly "taken care of." The informant adds: "The 
Morales post and the one in Tabalosos are just a minor example 
of the police corruption. Of course, if you don't pay, you could 
have problems." 
<H5>  "Official Permit" </H5>
  When the "route men" arrive in Bellavista, they contact the 
"passers," who are youths assigned to contact the firm chiefs, 
and who seek the best price for their potential clients. 
  They receive a commission from both the client and the 
purchaser. As one "passer" remarks: "In five minutes we can 
easily make 200 new soles. As a rule, each of us makes about 
five passes a day." 
  On the dock, two youths who arrived on a motorcycle 
approached the team from SI. One of them asked why photos were 
being taken. After we identified ourselves, displaying our 
reporters' ID cards, the stranger repeated: "You have taken 
photos of my chief's car, haven't you?" That was the signal 
letting us know that SI's activity had been watched at all 
times. After conversing with each other, the strangers hesitated 
slightly, remarking that it would be a good idea to cross the 
river and observe a massacre of 30 persons committed by the DEA 
a few weeks ago in one of its operations. And, finally, they 
gave their verdict: "All right, keep taking photos, but we don't 
want you to take them of persons, much less houses." They 
climbed onto their motorcycles and took off. Upon boarding, one 
of them disclosed the grip of a revolver in his belt. 
  Although it may seem untrue, this "official permit" proved 
more effective than the one granted by the military base chief, 
an Army captain known as "Peter." 
  The Bellavista military base is located on the second level, 
and is reached by the main road of the settlement itself, after 
rounding a curve. From there one may observe and inspect the 
town's main streets. Permission was requested from Captain 
"Peter" to take panoramic photos of the town, which he granted. 
However, when we returned to the first level, a civilian 
approached to indicate that he had a message from the captain. 
"I have notified the `patas' (narcos) to make `room' for the 
reporters, and to get out of town." This person claimed that the 
officer had said that no one should give us any kind of 
information on the drug traffic, "because, otherwise, everything 
would be ruined." 
  On the second level is the old airport, currently the only 
one that should be operating officially in Bellavista. Up 
higher, on the fourth level, a new official landing strip is 
being built by 30 members of an Army engineering company with 
headquarters in Juanjui. An expanse of 800 meters has been 
planned for the new runway, which will be under the control of 
the Peruvian Air Force [FAP]. However, according to some 
accounts, small planes are landing on the 280 meters already 
equipped for operations, to take on drugs. And this runway is 
only a five-minute journey from the military base headed by 
Captain "Peter." 
<H5>  On the Third Level </H5>
  According to information collected by SI, the entire 
population of Bellavista knows that the chiefs of the "firms" 
hold constant talks with the officers at the military base. 
  Where? In broad daylight, in restaurants located on the 
third 
level (the one after the level where the base is located). 
There, amid barbecues, cured meat, and tacacho (typical jungle 
dishes), as well as abundant liquor, all paid for by the 
"narcos," these talks are taking place. 
  Less than 500 meters from the base, on the third level, are 
the houses in which the firms are installed. One settler 
commented indignantly that the base officers "even have the 
nerve to drive by in cars and on motorcycles owned by the zone's 
"traqueteros" [handlers] and drug traffickers." 
  The resident went on to say: "All of us here know that drugs 
are obvious to, and patiently accepted by everyone. The `narcos' 
weigh the drugs in the middle of public thoroughfares, and both 
policemen and the military go by here without intervening. They 
even exchange friendly greetings." 
  This informant also remarked that the military charge an 
average of $15,000 per flight. 
  The flights are currently leaving the Biabo zone, a 20 
minute 
trip from the center of Bellavista. There is a clandestine 
airport, called La Union, there. According to a report received 
in the zone, on 18 February a flight took off loaded with 
approximately 500 kg of drugs. The shipment had originally 
departed from Madera. 
  Just as in Campanilla, where the "pato" [duck] system 
(military helicopters carrying drugs) had operated, there is 
also an air assistance system run by the military for the drug 
traffic in Bellavista. So much so that there is now a word for 
indicating the fact that an Army helicopter is carrying drugs in 
Bellavista: "rastreo" [tracking] 
  The "tracking" operations are generally conducted in the 
vicinity of the Biabo valley, especially in Barranca and La 
Union; as well as in Palmapampa. 
  "Traqueteros" (those loading the drugs) from the locality 
claimed that, to load a helicopter, there must be shipments from 
10 "route men's" trucks to transport approximately 700 kg of 
washed paste. 
  The flights are usually made between 2100 and 2200. For 
concealment, the Army forces are using a code for classified 
military operations: "Oscar May Charlie." Used only for 
countersubversive and, occasionally, counternarcotics 
operations, it relieves the pilots of their obligation to submit 
their flight plan to the FAP. It is now being used in routine 
operations. Cases are known wherein helicopters take off from 
Tarapoto on a flight that would require 20 minutes at the most, 
and reach their destinations five or six hours later. What is 
the helicopter doing during all that time? 
  When the conditions so permit, there may be up to three 
flights per month by Army helicopters carrying drugs. The source 
noted: "If business is down, the `milicos' [soldiers] make only 
one flight." 
  A concrete example of this incredible coexistence occurred 
during the early days of February. At the time, an Army 
helicopter was loaded with drugs on the outskirts of the town, 
to carry them to Chachapoyas, where they were picked up by a 
small plane and, finally, taken to Colombia. Between 11 and 12 
February, another small plane took off from La Union. Nearly 
3,000 kg of drugs departed from there, heading for Colombia. 
<H5>  The Largest </H5>
  According to information that has been collected, the most 
prominent firm chiefs currently operating in Bellavista are the 
following: 
  Cero Cinco [Zero Five] (the only one known to be a Peruvian) 
  Pelo Blanco [White Hair] (an older person with thick gray 
hair, of heavy build, Peruvian) 
  Trompa de Buque [Boat Horn] (he is Luis Hernan Pineda 
Menjura) 
  El Baron [The Baron] (Fernando Saldana Chavez, Peruvian, 
aide 
to "El Ministro") 
  They are considered the "capos," and have their drug 
marketing center on the third level of Bellavista. Their firms 
are regarded as reliable suppliers of the Colombian cartels. 
  There are also some small firms, disparagingly known as 
"Pichihuichi." There are only four. The Colombian "capos" do not 
give them, as they do to "the large ones," drugs on consignment 
"against payment," to be made after marketing. It was Demetrio 
Chavez, "Vaticano," who began the "against payment" system years 
ago in Campanilla. 
  In Bellavista, one kg of washed paste is currently priced at 
380 new soles, in cash, and at 480 new soles "against payment." 
  Also on the third level are the "hideouts," or laboratories 
in which the drugs are processed. There are at least 10 on the 
third level, and 15 on the fourth. The largest obtain an average 
of 50 kg of washed paste per day; and the small ones, 15 kg. At 
least three persons work in the "hideouts": the one in charge of 
the water, the sifter, and the one engaged in drying the drugs. 
The process can last four hours, depending on the quantity. 
  Each chief has several henchmen working to ensure his 
safety. 
They are his eyes and ears. When they see a stranger, they 
approach, ask him for documents, and interrogate him: something 
that not even the police do in Bellavista. Then they follow him, 
so as to report to their chiefs. 
  For example, they guard "El Baron's" house, with two stories 
and made of cement. Several youths tour the vicinity, while 
others do not move from the main door. Each one holds a knapsack 
in which he is obviously carrying weapons. 
  What do the municipal authorities say about what is 
happening 
in Bellavista? The only official with whom we spoke, who refused 
to identify himself, merely remarked: "You know, I know, 
everyone here knows about it. After all, a single person can't 
do anything." 
  Finally, the hotel, which was the last surprise: it was none 
other than the "Cardenas" Hotel. The founder: Guillermo Cardenas 
Davila, the notorious "Mosca Loca." Its manager: Luis Molque 
Cardenas Guzman, son of "Mosca Loca," known as "Mosquito." The 
clients? The chiefs of Bellavista, the new drug fortress in 
Huallaga.

  It is well-known that much of Lower Huallaga's population is 
living, in one way or another, on money from the drug traffic. 
There is no authority nor institution that "narco"-terrorism has 
not penetrated. 
  To give an example, the "narco"-trafficker, Waldo Vargas 
Arias, alias "El Ministro," has, as a personal rule, been 
donating $100 per month to each of the teachers in Yarina, in 
Yurimaguas. It is by way of a "subsidy" allowing them to receive 
a "decent" salary, and thereby enabling them to subsist. 
  Moreover, it was public knowledge that the deputy mayor of 
Bellavista, Francisco Longa Morales, received money from the 
"narcos" in the zone for permitting them to "work." This Mr. 
Longa, who had two motorcycle shops in Tarapoto itself, has now 
disappeared, and the police are on his trail. 
  Similarly, a local authority who preferred not to be 
identified claimed that most of the local news reporters have 
been receiving money in exchange for their silence. 
  The flights continue to take off regularly, and no one 
reports anything. The local residents comment that the news 
reports discuss anything other than what they all know is 
happening. An official who remained anonymous adds: "Don't 
forget that when there is a flight everyone here can eat." 
<H5>  [Box, p 36] </H5>
<H5>  Peter the Great </H5>
  "Peter the Great" is the name given to the chief of the 
Bellavista military base who, leading 30 men, conducted an 
operation last week on the so-called "first level" of this 
jungle locality, in which, incidentally, neither the DEA nor the 
police participated. 
  In one of the houses raided they captured the Colombians, 
Edgardo Castaneda Diza, William Garzon Calderon, Ali Gonzales 
Cuellar, and John Landazuri Landana; as well as the Peruvians, 
Fernando Saldana Chavez, alias "El Baron," Jose Pena Saldana, 
Goner Garcia Guerra, and Teodoro Camacho. 
  They confiscated from this group 1,800 kg of washed PBC, 
1,800 kg of raw PBC, 10 bags of ammoniac gum resin, six bags of 
charcoal, two 9 mm pistols, a mini-Uzi, a revolver, a pineapple 
type grenade, three motorcycles, an electric generating set, and 
a radio set. 
  However, local sources noted that, incidentally, 10 minutes 
before that operation, the drug trafficker, Waldo Vargas Arias, 
alias "El Ministro" was seen leaving the same house. 
  The same sources claim that "El Ministro " headed for the 
port, where he took a "lata" (glider] bound for Huimbayoc, 
Yurimaguas, where it is currently located.

<H5>  [Box, p 38] </H5>
<H5>  "We Can't Specify Anything" </H5>
  Marcelo Raymundo Perez, the current deputy mayor of 
Bellavista, claims to have no specific information on anything 
happening in his locality. He maintains that all the information 
he has is inaccurate or unconfirmed. 
  [Arrieta] The residents claim that small planes loaded with 
drugs are constantly taking off. What is your office doing about 
that? 
  [Perez] We have certain reports about it, and we have made 
them available to the pertinent authorities. They are not only 
about the drug traffic, but crime, also. Both are evils 
afflicting the entire population. 
  [Arrieta] But the flights continue to take off. Also, are 
there clandestine airports near this zone, or not? 
  [Perez] There has been talk lately about night flights 
leaving these airports, but I want to make it clear that it is 
our responsibility to put the information in the hands of the 
prosecutor's office and the police, so that both may conduct 
investigations. For example, last year we reported the creation 
of a clandestine runway in Sedega. 
  [Arrieta] How many cases like that have you reported to the 
authorities? 
  [Perez] I could not tell you; there are many similar cases. 
  [Arrieta] Have the people submitted any complaints about 
them. 
  [Perez] There have been complaints, and some charges, and 
even reports of people being murdered; but we don't know of any 
details concerning them. 
  [Arrieta] Are there firms in Bellavista? 
  [Perez] I don't know exactly. It is presumed, but we can't 
claim it; because people come and go, and we don't know whether 
or not the firms really exist. Bellavista is a strategic zone of 
Central Huallaga, and people move to both Biabo valley and Sisa 
valley. All this prevents our obtaining sufficient information. 
  [Arrieta] But are the firms operating here or not? 
  [Perez] They may be operating but, as I told you, we can't 
specify anything. 
  [Arrieta] You were saying that the flights take off at 
night. 
  [Perez] That is claimed, but we can't specify the exact site 
from which they take off. We know that there are some flights, 
because we hear them at night; but we don't have accurate 
information. 
  [Arrieta] What do you need to find out about these 
situations 
with a minimum of accuracy? 
  [Perez] Well, the fact is that we don't have sufficient 
personnel to cover all these irregularities.

  [Text] Yurimaguas, the most important river port on the 
lower Huallaga and one of the great entry points to Amazonia, is 
also one of the forest capitals around which today operates one 
of the most active drug trafficking bands. 
  The Huallaga River is navigable to deep-draught vessels up 
to 
this point. Beyond the port, upstream, traffic is limited to 
launches. Distances are measured in launch/hours. The principal 
product of traffic by this means is basic cocaine paste (BCP), 
gathered by the so-called "traqueteros." 
  A port captaincy operates in Yurimaguas, which is manned by 
a 
detachment of the Peruvian Navy. From August to October 1993, 
the period within which these events took place, the port 
captain was Navy First Lieutenant Victor Herrera Sheen. One of 
his deputies was AP [Peruvian Navy] Lieutenant Pedro Huarcaya 
Briceno. 
  Huarcaya and Herrera are the central figures in this 
account, 
provided voluntarily by a maritime officer [oficial de mar] to 
the Special Investigative Working Group on Drug Trafficking, 
appointed by the Constituent Democratic Congress (CCD). The 
investigative group is headed by Julio Castro Gomez of the 
Democratic Movement of the Left (MDI). 
<H5>  Telejo Airport </H5>
  Leaving Yurimaguas going south on the Huallaga, after two 
hours one arrives at the village of Telejo. In August 
1993--according to the testimony of the maritime witness to the 
CCD committee--a clandestine airport was constructed there under 
the benign gaze of his chiefs. 
  Shortly before 1993, through the intermediate ports of 
Garcilaso, Abel Guerra and La Boca, people noticed--and they 
noticed it because access to the port is open--heavy traffic in 
iron and cement from Yurimaguas to Telejo. Mention is made of 
frequent shipments (it is not specified whether daily or weekly) 
of 50 bags of cement. But there are no important building 
projects in Telejo. Then why so much building material? 
  "The boat owners and the pilots told us that it was for the 
airport," said the mariner. 
  The members of the CCD committee asked him specifically if 
he 
knew of BCP flights from Telejo. 
  "I knew of an initial flight about 30 days ago (calculating 
dates, this had to be about mid-September) and of a second 
flight Thursday at midnight (in mid-October), that is, with 
night navigation. 
  Between 40 and 50 men worked on the project. But who gave 
the 
order to build the airstrip? 
<H5>  The "Caletas" </H5>
  The accuser also testified to an intense traffic of raw 
materials for the manufacture of BCP. He mentioned kerosene, 
carbonate, sulfuric acid, and calcium. The lieutenants observed 
this without reacting. 
  The enumeration of the delivery points for these materials 
by 
the accuser is interesting. Within the environs of Yurimaguas he 
indicated the settlement of Shitari, at 15 minute distance, and 
Santa Elena, Santa Maria, Santa Isabel and Dos de Mayo, within a 
similar radius. 
  At more remote distances--from two to three and a half 
hours--he mentioned Shucushuyacu, Yarina, Shazuta and Huimbayoc. 
The crude paste reaches these locations and is converted into 
refined paste. The places where these conversions take place are 
called "caletas." 
  All of these places centered around Huimbayoc form the 
domain 
of Waldo Vargas Arias, "capo" of the drug traffic, of Colombian 
nationality, better known under the nickname of El Ministro. 
<H5>  Which Authorities </H5>
  The CCD committee asked the maritime officer for the names 
of 
the officials or authorities who knew of the activities he was 
revealing. 
  "The only names of officers that I could give--he 
replied--would be those of Lieutenant AP Pedro Huarcaya Briceno 
and First Lieutenant AP Victor Herrera Sheen. Lieutenant Herrera 
is the port captain and Lieutenant Huarcaya, chief of personnel, 
reports to him daily." 
  The witness was asked whether he knew the version according 
to which the military authorities were providing security to the 
drug traffickers so that the airplanes could take off without 
problems. 
  "I had no knowledge of that, but I can add something. One 
can 
see--he declared--police officers as well as naval officers 
having meetings with people connected to the drug traffic. I can 
mention Mr. Miguel or Luis Farro. This individual is known in 
the area as a "narco." He has several launches that travel all 
over the Huallaga. I have even seen two emissaries from El 
Ministro who came from Huimbayoc to visit my superiors." 
<H5>  Detachment in Yurimaguas </H5>
  One of the premises of the maritime officer was that the 
activities of the "traqueteros" or collectors was by means of 
the launches. 
  "Did your immediate commander ever order an action against 
these `traqueteros,''' he was asked. 
  "We were never ordered specifically to intervene against 
`traqueteros.' However, on one occasion we crossed the river to 
the Huimbayoc area, under the command of Lieutenant Huarcaya." 
  They departed in two launches at 0430, so as not to be seen. 
But the crossing took place without incident. When they reached 
Huimbayoc, Huarcaya deployed his people behind an island and 
ordered them to act. They proceeded to search everyone without 
distinction. Dollars were discovered, but no drugs. The 
lieutenant claimed that the money came from drugs and gave the 
order to seize it. Everyone turned over the proceeds to the 
chief. Lieutenant Huarcaya kept the booty until the return to 
Yurimaguas. Only then would he proceed to distribute it, 
according to the rank of each. 
  Meanwhile, the operation continued. "This is good, and we 
are 
going to stay," he ordered. 
  A brothel was operating in Huimbayoc, on the banks of the 
river, despite the explicit prohibition of the regulations. The 
naval witness said that the rule is as follows: the entire 
riverine zone is property of the state and no establishement of 
that type may operate there. 
  On that tropical night, Lieutenant Huarcaya was the special 
guest of a certain "Passion." The eight military personnel who 
accompanied him acted as security. The naval witness and accuser 
asserted that on that occasion, in addition to the pleasures 
provided by the service, "Passion" paid Lieutenant Huarcaya the 
sum of $2,000, so that the patrol would continue to turn a blind 
eye to the brothel's activities. This is what is stated in the 
testimony in the hands of the CCD's working committee. 
  Two caches were discovered in the village, the first of 
about 
120 kg and the second of 100 kg of paste in the process of 
steeping, deposited in plastic drums. 
  "We must not get involved in problems. I am going to fix 
things with the secretary for discipline of the night patrol, 
Mr. Alegria aka `Guitarron,' and with the president, Mr. 
Macedo," was the lieutenant's remark. 
  The detachment went to Yurimaguas. The amount collected was 
$2,800 ($800 seized on the island and $2,000 paid by "Passion"). 
Huarcaya tipped the senior technician $60, those beneath him in 
rank $40, and $20 to the corporal. The intelligence technician, 
Reynero Gallo, was the one who actually paid out the shares. And 
the rest of the booty? Naturally, there were complaints. "The 
matter is closed and do not test my patience," was how 
Lieutenant Huarcaya dealt with this issue. 
  "Do you know whether any of this money reached higher 
ranking 
personnel?" was an important question asked of the naval witness. 
  "No. The only officer of higher rank was Lieutenant Victor 
Herrera Sheen, who at that moment was in Lima. Lieutenant Pedro 
Huarcaya ordered the raid while he was alone. He did everything 
without informing the director of captaincies, Admiral Texeira, 
and without informing his superiors in Lima.'' 
  The CCD Special Investigative Working Group on Drug 
Trafficking, directed by Julio Castro Gomez, has been 
investigating the case since the end of October 1993. 
<H5>  [Box, p 35] </H5>
<H5>  The Art of Escaping </H5>
  Not only National Police personnel were involved in the 
escape of the Colombian drug trafficker called El Ministro, on 
May 1993, but also naval officers in charge of the Yurimaguas 
Port Captaincy. 
  Also involved in the illegal liberation of Waldo Vargas 
Arias, in exchange for a bribe of $100,000, were Navy 
Lieutenants Victor Herrera sheen and Pedro Huarcaya Briceno, 
officers who were in charge of the naval base at the port of 
Yurimaguas at the time. 
  This is what is emphatically stated by the maritime officer, 
who witnessed the events, and who decided late last year to 
present himself to the CCD Special Investigative Working Group 
on Drug Trafficking to tell the whole truth. 
  According to his testimony, two policemen whose names he 
does 
not know but who he could recognize, turned over to Navy 
Lieutenant Victor Herrera the sum of $8,000. The money was paid 
so that the naval officers would allow the departure without the 
required authorization of the boat or launch on which El 
Ministro, his companion, and two bodyguards made their escape. 
  A Navy quartermaster named Ramirez was an eye witness to the 
payment of $8,000 and it was he who communicated the fact to the 
rest of the personnel of the Captaincy. Quartermaster Ramirez 
also claimed that four days before the arrival in Yurimaguas of 
the PNP [Peruvian National Police] Investigative Commission, led 
by General Rodolfo Angeles, the policemen met with the commander 
of the Port Captaincy. 
  The Commission did not interview either of the two naval 
officers. Neither did any Navy inspection team investigate the 
incident. There is only the report of the appearance of a naval 
inspector who limited himself to checking the Captaincy's 
administrative work, according to the version of the accuser 
that was provided to the CCD Working Group. 
  There is more. With regard to the various irregularities 
that 
have occurred at the Port Captaincy of Yurimaguas, the assistant 
technician of the naval police, Jaime Huaman, submitted a 
detailed report to the deputy chief of personnel in Lima. But 
the outcome was negative. Informed of the report, Lieutenant 
Herrera began to harass technician Huaman. The latter's report 
described the lack of surveillance of drug trafficking in the 
area and abuses of authority by the two officers. 
  Lieutenants Victor Herrera and Pedro Huarcaya continued on 
at 
the base in Yurimaguas until late last year, in spite of having 
exceeded the six-month period of assignment to the area 
established for officers.

  [Excerpt] Huacho, 25 Mar -- Six corrupt Peruvian National 
Police [PNP] noncommissioned officers who illegally released 
Clara Chumbe Rondono, aka Aunt Clara--the most sought drug 
trafficker in the northern region of Lima Department--were 
imprisoned last night in the Carquin jail located in Carquin. 
  It has been reported that the corrupt PNP members received 
$10,000 for allowing Rondono to go free. Rondono was arrested 
with 2 kg of highly pure cocaine paste. 
  It has been learned that two other PNP officers were 
reportedly involved in this case, but their names will not be 
disclosed until the investigation that is being conducted is 
completed and their involvement in this regrettable incident has 
been clearly established. 
  According to court investigations under way, those arrested 
are members of the Huaral police delegation, and participated in 
an antidrug operation conducted in Huaral on 12 December 1993.

  [Excerpts] Peru produces about 2,000 metric tons of basic 
cocaine paste per year, of which 90 percent is "exported" by the 
mafias to various places in the world, according to an 
evaluation in the draft of the National Prevention and Drug 
Control Plan. 
  About 900 metric tons of refined basic cocaine (valued at 
about $600 million) are produced from the aforementioned 
tonnage. This represents a potential annual production of 
between 650 and 700 metric tons of cocaine hydrochlorate. 
  The figures in this document are very revealing and make 
clear the increase of coca leaf's cultivation for illegal ends 
and the "cocalization" of the economy. [passage omitted] 
  These figures also demonstrate the very large differences 
that exist between the legal and illegal cultivation of coca 
leaf. 
  There are at least 200,000 campesino families that illegally 
cultivate the leaf, while there are only 27,000 families that 
cultivate it legally, located mainly in La Convencion and Lares 
Valleys in Cuzco Department. 
  Exact statistics do no exist, but it is estimated that 
between 15,000 and 20,000 hectares are currently dedicated to 
the legal cultivation of the leaf and a minimum of 10,000 metric 
tons of coca leaf are produced yearly. This is a very small 
quantity when it is compared to the 223,900 metric tons produced 
illegally. 
  But the functioning National Coca Enterprise (Enaco) is a 
demonstration of state organizations' lack of efficiency in the 
control of these cultivations. 
  Enaco is charged with exercising the monopoly of the 
commercialization and industrialization of coca leaf, but it 
does not control even one-half of the area and production of 
legal coca leaf production. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Of the 10 Bell-212 helicopters donated by the U.S. 
State Department to the National Police for interdiction 
operations against drug trafficking in the Peruvian jungle, five 
are sitting broken down in Pucallpa. 
  This information was provided by National Police sources, 
who 
indicated that antinarcotics operations in the Upper Huallaga, 
as well as in the mountain ranges of the central jungle, have 
been momentarily suspended because of the absence of these 
helicopters. 
  Experts in the struggle against drug trafficking said that 
the helicopters are a great help in transporting police 
personnel, as land transportation is very difficult in the 
jungle due to ambushes by narcoterrorists. 
  A spokesman for the National Police said that despite this 
inconvenience operations are going on, but not as many.

  The first 200 kg of drugs were seized on 25 March when PNP 
and Army forces jointly raided a warehouse at the Inambari 
airport. They found the drug packed in small bags. 
  Yesterday morning other warehouses of the zone were raided 
resulting in the arrest of 10 people, among them four foreigners. 
  Another 600 kg of drugs, which was about to be shipped in 
small planes to Colombia, was seized. 
  PNP director reported that Madre de Dios department has 
become an intermediary route for drug traffickers that use 
Colombian small planes to transport the drugs via the town of 
Cruzeiro de Brazil to Colombia. 
  The defense minister, through the Political Military 
Command's Southeastern National Security Zone, issued a 
communique on these operations. 
  In the communique, which was sent to the various sectors of 
the media, the defense minister states that Maldonado Port 
attorney, the chief of the 4th Engineering Battalion, and 
military personnel were sent as reinforcement to the zone 
yesterday. 
  He said the political-military command will continue 
operations against trafficking in the region.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, who returned to 
our country on 30 March after chairing the OAS assembly, 
rejected a UN report on the "laundering" of drug trafficking 
money in some of our country's free trade zones. 
  Abreu categorically rejected this possibility. Nevertheless, 
he said he would carefully review this issue. 
  Denying the document that circulated in the United Nations, 
the foreign minister stressed: "There is not a single 
possibility for Uruguay to be a drug trafficking center." 
  For his part, Jose Luis Ovalle, the Free Trade Zones 
national 
director, said this document is almost one month old. This 
information has been picked up from the press, he said, adding 
that the entire issue is inaccurate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Caracas, 10 Apr (AFP) -- The Venezuelan Police have 
reported that 10 heavily armed individuals, alleged members of a 
Colombian drug trafficking-guerrilla column, today raided the 
Cachiche-Aramara Airport in Puerto Ayacucho, 520 km southeast of 
Caracas, hijacked a plane, and fled to Colombia. 
  A Caracas Radio Rumbos report indicated that the violent 
attack took place at 0600 (1000 GMT)--a time when more that 
1,000 members of the military and police forces quartered at the 
airport "were sound asleep." According to the radio station, 
the airport's traffic controller, whose name remained 
undisclosed, arrived as the plane was taking off with the 
attackers on board. 
  It was also reported that the raid by the alleged Colombian 
drug trafficking-guerrilla column took place at a time when 
members of the state security corps were in Puerto Ayacucho 
combing the area to rescue a Venezuelan citizen who was 
kidnapped 10 days ago. The plane, of which no details were 
released, belongs to the regional Puerto Ayacucho government.

3189): "Liuzhou Police Break Up Transnational Drug Trafficking 
Ring, Arresting 13 Criminals and Seizing Some 3 kg of Heroin"] 
  [Text] Nanning 26 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- Liuzhou, in Guangxi, 
broke up a major transnational drug trafficking ring, arresting 
13 criminals, two of whom were Burmese. Some 2,800 grams of 
heroin and 30,000 yuan were seized, in addition to 280,000 yuan 
and $500 in counterfeit banknotes. 
  The drug was trafficked to the Chinese mainland from Burma 
via Yunnan, with the ultimate destinations of Guangzhou and Hong 
Kong. On their way via Liuzhou, the traffickers attempted to 
"open a new market" in that city. On 3 March, this ring of 
criminals wrapped some heroin in small packages, which they put 
in their pockets, and started peddling them on the street. They 
were promptly discovered, and reported to the police. 
  At around 1500, drug-trafficker Peng Zhiquan [1756 1809 
2938] 
was caught red-handed while making a deal with someone. Peng's 
house was searched, with the result that 120 grams of heroine 
and a balance and a drug-packaging apparatus were discovered. 
  With clues provided by Peng, two other drug-traffickers--Lin 
Guorong [2651 0948 2837], and Xu Zijun [6079 2655 0689]--then 
were rounded up, with 140 grams of heroin seized. 
  In the wake of this operation, local public security cadres 
and policemen tracked down other accomplices by following clues 
in hot pursuit. One after another, the whole ring of drug 
traffickers was rounded up, including Long Minxiong [7893 2404 
7160], Dong Yunxiang [5516 0061 7449], He Ganmo [0149 1626 
7803], Zhang Zhijun [1728 1807 6511], Bao Dolong [0202 6670 
7893], and Yu Jiachang [0151 1367 2490]. In addition, 18 bricks 
of heroin weighing a total of 2,500 grams were seized, along 
with 280,000 yuan in counterfeit 100-yuan notes and $500 in 
counterfeit banknotes, as well as some 30,000 yuan of drug 
money, a gun, and a number of fake identification cards.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Overnight fame and 
phenomenal fortune without the labors of Hercules are the 
lead-up of sports drug abuse in China. 
  But its sports officials changed perspective to look into 
the 
headache on Tuesday [5 April] for a cure. 
  An Anti-Doping China'94 seminar was held to arouse the 
attention of all those who call the shots in sporting activities 
in the country's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous 
regions. 
  Also present at the seminar were the principals from all 
China's physical education institutions and the top officials 
from its ministerial sports associations. 
  Central warning was sounded to alert freewheeling athletes. 
  Wu Shaozu, director of the State Commission for Sports and 
Physical Culture, emphasized doping controls through clear 
stipulation, tight check and harsh penalty. 
  "Actions must be taken," said the sports minister who took 
his first trip abroad to attend the Second World Anti-Doping 
Congress in Moscow in 1989. 
  The number of positive cases reported on Chinese athletes in 
national and international events is appalling to the central 
control of the country's sports mechanism. 
  From a Chinese markswoman failing her test during a World 
Cup 
meet in late 1987 up till January this year, 33 Chinese were 
tested positive for performance-enhancing substances, mainly 
anabolic steroids. 
  These athletes were in 13 sports of shooting, speed skating, 
modern pentathlon, track and field, volleyball, swimming, 
wrestling, judo, sporting acrobatics, canoeing, weightlifting, 
boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. 
  Among the caught dopers were world and Olympic champions as 
well as global and continental record setters. 
  "We cannot afford to remain passive in merely detecting and 
penalizing them," said Yuan Weimin, vice-sports minister and 
director of China's anti-doping committee set up in July 1992 as 
a subcommittee under the National Olympic Committee. 
  Yuan said that China first conducted doping tests nationwide 
in 1988 and built an IOC-approved doping control laboratory the 
following year. 
  "But each year there always appear athletic drug abusers to 
tarnish China's sports achievement," said Yuan. 
  After six years of trials and errors, the Chinese sports 
commission decided to take an active role. 
  "We are shifting focus from detection to education and 
prevention," said Wu Tuesday. 
  "It's because there are still people who slight the works of 
the anti-doping committee," Yuan said. 
  He recalled that China launched its first intensive 
anti-doping effort prior to the Barcelona Olympics when 
pamphlets were published on moral and medical side-effects of 
drug abuse. 
  Yuan's committee has written down a stipulation of 15 rules 
concerning banned substances and later added rules concerning 
nutrition food and beverage. "China's principle in developing 
sports is to better the physique of the entire population," he 
explained. 
  Wu hit home the key point of the seminar when he said that a 
decree in his name would soon be issued to draw the line between 
medical treatment and performance-enhancing build-up; between 
individual venture and collaboration among athletes, doctors, 
coaches and even officials. 
  Penalties, Wu ordered, will be from moral criticism to 
disciplinary and even legal actions. 
  Yang Tianle, China's member on the IOC Medical Commission 
who 
gave an in-depth lecture on anti-doping Tuesday, added still 
another line between intentional activity and medical illiteracy. 
  Now the lines have been drawn between the do's and don'ts in 
China's anti-doping campaign, offenders, be they individual 
athletes or collaborative teams, will be penalized as severely 
as international federations do or maybe more so to thwart the 
practice among the Chinese, Wu concluded.

    [Editorial Report] An article in Beijing XIAOFEI SHIBAO in 
Chinese on 24 January 1994 presents an overview of drug use in 
China's western provinces. The article begins with statistics 
indicating the scope of the drug problem in China's western 
cities. In Xining, there are over 1,000 registered drug users. 
Xian has over 1,000 addicts, and in a railroad engineer school 
in Lanzhou, one class has over 48 students that use drugs. 
According to the article, with so many overt drug users, the 
number of secret users is undoubtedly much greater. A survey of 
over 400 drug users revealed that 72.6 percent were under the 
age of 25, while 22.3 percent were between the ages of 25 and 
35. Of those surveyed, 62.89 percent had a middle-school 
education, 23.23 percent had completed high school, and 12.8 
percent had only been to primary school. The article's 
introduction also touches on the money associated with drug 
trafficking. In Yunnan, 1 kg of heroin is worth 5,000-10,000 
yuan. In Guangdong, 1 kg is worth 30,000-50,000 yuan, and in 
Hong Kong, US$30,000-50,000. 
  The next section of the article discusses various methods 
used to smuggle drugs, such as concealing them in tires, gas 
tanks, hollowed-out books, and other devices. To pass through 
customs, smugglers also conceal drugs in various body cavities, 
such as the stomach or vagina. In one case a woman hollowed out 
the chest of a dead infant and concealed drugs within it. 
  The article then moves on to the social costs associated 
with 
the use of heroin: broken homes, theft, murder, and 
prostitution. Users often begin using drugs and later get 
involved in trafficking and other crimes. One 19-year-old woman 
became involved in prostitution to support her drug habit. By 
the time public security caught her, she had three different 
venereal diseases. 
  The next section sketches the personality types of drug 
users. Many of the users aged 15-25 are "experimenters"--people 
who know very little about heroin and are not aware of what they 
are getting into. Others succumb to peer pressure. Drug users, 
the article asserts, love company, and any given user will have 
three to eight companions. The new affluence has produced 
another group of users; drug use is seen as the "consumption of 
the rich" and "high class enjoyment." However, people often 
spend themselves back into poverty and destroy their households. 
The misguided use of heroin as a medicinal drug has produced 
yet another category of user, as some who attempt to cure 
disease with it end up addicted. A related delusion 
occasionally afflicts young women, who see heroin as an 
effective agent for weight loss. A final category, according to 
the article, consists of people who turn to drugs after divorce 
in an effort to restore their emotional balance. 
  The final section of the article briefly discusses worldwide 
statistics on drug use, noting that China was a "drug-free 
nation" until the 1970s, when drug use began to become a problem 
in border regions. Currently, China has 148,000 registered drug 
users. However, in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, 
Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Guangdong, the actual number of 
users far exceeds 150,000, according to a random survey.

Deft Hand of Member of Joint Defense Force Seizes Drug Criminal 
Crossing the Border--Changning County Breaks Especially Large 
Multinational Armed Drug Peddling Case"] 
  [Text] Recently Changning County broke an especially large 
multinational armed drug peddling case, captured a foreign drug 
dealer, and seized 17.93 kilograms of heroin. 
  On 12 January, three people, a member of the Zhujie 
Township, 
Changning County joint defense force; a leading comrade from 
Yangjie Village; and a village forest protector, went up the 
mountain on forest protection. At 6:30 p.m., while walking at 
the foot of Jinjia, Yangjie Village, they saw two middle-aged 
men coming at them from a distance. One man carrying a 
two-shoulder backpack was walking in the front and one man 
carrying two bulging woven plastic bags was walking in back 
peering around flustered. Our three people were suddenly 
suspicious. Waiting for the three suspects to approach, our 
three people, carrying pistols and assault rifles, came forward 
to interrogate them. The two people appeared more flustered and 
hemmed and hawed. As the member of the joint force was preparing 
to search the two woven plastic bags, the middle-aged man with 
the backpack suddenly pulled a hand grenade from his waist and 
wildly smashed into the body of the member of the joint force, 
and after throwing the hand grenade at his body, rolled on the 
ground. Seeing the smoking hand grenade, our three people 
quickly fell back on the ground and the instant that the hand 
grenade exploded, the two suspects jumped into a ditch overgrown 
with foliage and fled. 
  After the sound of the explosion had passed, our people 
quickly followed in the direction of the fleeing suspects and 
discovered that one suspect had already run to a hill 80 meters 
away and the other had vanished without a trace. One after the 
other, they lifted their rifles and fired and then and there 
they shot one of the suspects and confiscated 17.93 kilograms of 
heroin. Our people arrested the drug dealer and took him to the 
village public security station and immediately reported to the 
county and the township. The township party secretary and the 
county public security bureau leader one after another led 
cadres and police to the scene and conducted a detailed 
reconnaissance of the scene. It was determined that the wounded 
drug dealer was Li Laoqi [2621 5071 0003] from Guogang [2654 
2413] in Burma. 
  Presently, Changning County public security organizations 
are 
organizing police forces to apprehend the escapee and are trying 
the case.

<F P=106> [Article: "Peng Jianfei Conducts Talks With U.S. Guest"] </F>
  [Text] On 29 January, secretary-general of the provincial 
anti-drug committee and assistant department head of the 
provincial public security department Peng Jianfei [1756 1696 
7378] representing the provincial anti-drug committee held 
discussions in Kunming on anti-drug issues with visiting U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State Gelbard and his party. 
  In the discussions, Peng Jianfei said that since the 
beginning of the 1980s, provoked and enticed by international 
drug dealing activities, foreign and domestic drug dealing 
elements have colluded to seek exorbitant profits and smuggled 
drugs across the border for transfer to the international 
market. All of the drug dealing cases that the Yunnan police 
have broken and all of the drugs that they have confiscated came 
from outside. So, the core of the Yunnan anti-drug struggle has 
been to strike at the cross-border drug dealing. 
  In the early 1980s, much of what was confiscated in the 
Yunnan border regions was opium and it was mainly a small number 
of people living on the frontier who dealt drugs. In recent 
years, drug dealing activities have changed greatly and have 
tended to become large-scale and refined. In 1990 Yunnan police 
broke 2,143 drug dealing cases and confiscated 1,445 kilograms 
of heroin. In 1991 they broke 3,583 drug dealing cases, of which 
2,717 were for selling and transporting heroin, and they 
confiscated 1,656 kilograms of heroin. In 1992 they broke 3,643 
drug dealing cases and confiscated 4,075 kilograms of heroin. In 
1993 they broke 4,174 drug dealing cases and confiscated 3,546 
kilograms of heroin. In addition, armed drug dealing has clearly 
increased. In one respect, this shows that Yunnan Province's 
drug enforcement has been strengthened from year to year and 
more drugs have been confiscated each year. In another respect, 
it shows that infiltration of foreign drugs into Yunnan has 
increased rather than decreased. Although Yunnan police are 
understaffed and lack equipment, it can be said without qualms 
that they have been highly effective in their anti-drug struggle 
and have made a very great contribution to international society. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Gelbard expressed admiration 
and 
appreciation for the efforts of the Yunnan police under 
difficult conditions and the success that they have achieved. 
  The two sides also exchanged ideas on how they can further 
strengthen bilateral cooperation in the anti-drug area. 
  Assistant secretary-general of the anti-drug committee and 
head of the drug enforcement office of the provincial public 
security department Chen Cunyi [7115 1317 0308] also 
participated in the talks. 
  In the evening, Governor He Zhiqiang met and feted Assistant 
Secretary of State Gelbard and his party at a Kunming restaurant.

  According to the records of the Dac Lac Provincial Labor,

reportedly addicted to opium; one third are heavily addicted. 
This "phenomenal social vice" has only developed over the past 
three years, mainly among the new ethnic minority settlers 
migrating from Cao Bang. Hundreds of households are now living 
in destitute conditions because of opium addiction. In early 
1994, Dac Lac set up a labor education center to help 
rehabilitate drug addicts. Opium addiction is still on the rise, 
though, and may spread quickly to local residents because the 
number of immigrants from Cao Bang is growing fast. (Hanoi

  [Text] Narita, Chiba Pref. [prefecture], April 4 KYODO -- 
Police said Monday [4 April] they have arrested a man from 
Singapore on suspicion of smuggling psychotropic drugs with a 
market value of 20 million yen into Japan. 
  Loh Seng Chow, 39, a machinist, arrived at Tokyo's Narita 
airport from Bangkok on March 16 without his luggage, which had 
been mistakenly left behind. 
  During a routine check of Loh's unaccompanied luggage, which 
arrived on another flight 20 minutes later, customs officials 
found almost 20,000 tablets packed into vinyl bags, hidden in 
the hood of a jumper. 
  Loh was apprehended soon afterward at a nearby hotel for 
allegedly violating the Narcotic Control Law, police said. 
  It is the biggest haul of psychotropic drugs ever 
confiscated 
at Narita and the second highest amount nationwide. 
  Loh told investigators he received the drugs from a female 
he 
met by chance in Bangkok who promised to pay 50,000 yen for the 
successful delivery of the drugs to Japan. 
  Depending on the dosage, psychotropic or mind-expanding 
drugs 
produce a wide range of effects including hallucinations and 
altered sensations. Abuse has become widespread in Japan, 
especially among young people. 
  With this latest case, the overall amount of psychotropic 
drugs confiscated this year comes to about 45,000 tablets, more 
than the entire amount of drugs recovered for the whole of last 
year.

  [Excerpts] It was an incongruous picture, the hefty 
bodybuilder on the verge of tears. Twenty-three-year-old 
Kamlaksha Shetty, arrested late in October while trying to 
smuggle a kilogram of heroin out of the country, was pleading 
with police officers to somehow get him off the hook. 
  [Passage omitted] The arts student at Bhavan's college in 
Andheri, the police said, had concealed over 100 plastic 
capsules containing three grams of heroin each in his stomach 
and intestines, to smuggle them to Mauritius. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  Shetty's father retired a few years ago from his job as 
senior technician in a city engineering firm. "No one in the 
family is earning any money," Shetty says. Perhaps that led him 
to agree to being a "carrier," as the police term it. 
  In jeans and brightly-patterned cotton shirt, Shetty is the 
typical college student. Anyone meeting the dark curly haired, 
third-year student of history and philosophy on the street would 
expect a degree of bravado in his talk. [Passage omitted] 
  Now, as the enormity of his crime slowly sinks in--under the 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Shetty will 
spend 10 of the best years of his life in jail--the bluster has 
all evaporated. What was merely a schoolboy lark has turned out 
to be serious indeed. 
  "There was a man, Noormohammed Salewala, who used to hang 
around in the college canteen with us, and joke with me 
sometimes," Shetty says. "One day he asked me if I would do a 
small job for him. He would pay me Rs 30,000, he said." 
  Shetty is merely the youngest of an emerging new breed of 
white-collar drug-traffickers, lured by the easy profits and 
glamour associated with what is virtually an industry--growing 
explosively, exponentially. He seems to have all the attributes 
of the new breed--his parents are well-placed and fairly well 
off, and his brother works in advertising. 
  [Passage omitted] Today, the average drug-trafficker could 
well be the clean-cut, slick talking boy next door. Or like 
Major Motilal Tiku, arrested in November last year after he 
helped drug-traffickers set up an export unit as a cover for 
their activities, they may be firmly entrenched in the ranks of 
the establishment. 
  Apart from the odd policeman, the narcotics cell's bag of 
drug-sellers last year also included an assistant collector of 
central excise, two doctors, and a brace of laboratory 
assistants. 
  In fact the cell made the largest-ever seizure of mandrax 
tablets in the world--five tonnes on January 13--after officials 
discovered that a doctor was routinely manufacturing heroin at 
his Kurla home. 
  Dr Imtiyaz Mohammed Iliyas, 33, told the police that he had 
opened a dispensary in a Vakola shop allegedly given to him by 
industrialist Ramakrishna Bajaj. "I practiced for one year," he 
says, "but I never earned enough to feed my family." 
  Iliyas got into the drugs trade through a classmate who told 
him that his dispensary was an ideal place to "park" charas 
until it was picked up. He was paid Rs 10,000 for every 
consignment the drug-runners stored there. Periodically, he also 
sold small quantities of heroin in the local market, around one 
kilogram at a time. 
  One of these deals went sour, and by 1990, he had been 
arrested by the police, but was released on bail. The case is 
still pending in the sessions court. 
  A scared Iliyas fled to Indore after one of his regular 
buyers, Babita Shardul, was arrested by the police. But by then 
he had managed to place his brother Anis, 42, in the business. 
Anis was himself later arrested by the narcotics cell. 
  Iliyas returned to Bombay in 1992, and put up his shingle in 
Chunabhatti. He joined the ONGC [Oil and Natural Gas Commission] 
as a medical officer. Again, he says, he had money problems, and 
turned to his friends in the drug trade to bail him out. Put in 
touch with one of the big fish, Prembhai Shetty, he was taught 
how to prepare mandrax tablets from methaqualone powder. 
  Meanwhile he was preparing heroin at home, with raw stock 
from his Pathan friends, and selling it at a profit of Rs 10,000 
per kg. When arrested by the police this year, he took them to 
the Victoria Docks and showed them two 20-foot containers full 
of nearly five tonnes of mandrax. 
  Major Motilal Tiku, Kashmiri and formerly of the Dogra 
Rifles, presents a case fraught with national security 
implications. After retirement in 1985, he set up a factory in 
Raigad. His involvement with the drug traffickers began last 
year, after he was approached for help with export formalities. 
  Major Tiku's two sons are highly placed. One of them, 
Rajendra, is in the IPS [Indian Police Service], and is an 
inspector-general of police (crime) in Jammu and Kashmir. The 
other, Pradeep, holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the 
army, and is presently posted in Assam. 
  These delicate postings, combined with their father's 
involvement in the drug trade, would render them ideal targets 
for blackmail by agents provocateurs. Except for the fact that 
both men have apparently severed relations with their father, 
the latter's involvement could well have serious security 
implications. 
  Major Tiku claims that he even advised the drug traffickers 
to set up a small unit to manufacture chemical items, as a cover 
for their activities, and promised to help them get a bank loan 
and complete all the necessary formalities. The police were led 
to him after they arrested two accomplices with more than 200 
kgs. of mandrax tablets in their possession. 
  Last October the narcotics cell also arrested Bishistha 
Narayan Singh, an assistant collector of central excise, who 
misused his official position in helping a drug-runner analyse a 
batch of mandrax tablets. [Passage omitted] 
  "There seems to be no reason but plain greed to explain why 
all these people have gotten into the business," says the DCP 
[Deputy Commissioner of Police], Mr Sur. "They seemed to have 
nearly everything they could wish for, and yet that's not 
enough." 
  The sheer geographical spread of his work prompted 
Surendrajit Singh, a 65-year-old coach attendant on Western 
Railway, to enter drug-trafficking. For 10 years before he was 
arrested in 1991, he smuggled contraband across the 
country--most often taped to the insides of water tanks and the 
supply pipes of the toilets in the compartments he was stationed 
in. 
  He was caught, finally, with a load of heroin he had ordered 
from a supplier in Rajasthan. 
  "The city, serviced by 37 airlines and two ports, is the 
ideal stop-over point for drugs," says Mr Sur. "And with the 
far-flung network of railway lines, narcotics are travelling on 
the railways into the hinterland." 
  During the period from 1990, when Mr Sur took over the 
Narcotics cell, a total of 17 tonnes of narcotics has been 
seized, running into around US$500 million in international 
markets. Typically, law enforcement officials are able to seize 
less than 10 per cent of contraband. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, April 7, IRNA -- Some 95,215 kgs of 
narcotics were seized by the law enforcement personnel last 
year, according to deputy chief of the force Brigadier General 
Ansari here Thursday. 
  He said that the amount of seizure was 24 percent more than 
the narcotic drugs seized the previous year. 
  Ansari said that his forces also succeeded in busting 155 
smuggling gangs and arresting 14,964 drug dealers. 
  Law enforcement activities over the past few years included 
building of 1,000 kms of roads, 70 outposts, 140 watchtowers, 
blocking 20 passes frequented by drug traffickers and digging 38 
kms of canals along border strip, he said. 
  Thanks to such measures, Ansari said, drug traffickers have 
been forced to take a longer route in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
  The general said that 70 members of the law enforcement 
personnel attained martyrdom in 1993 in armed clashes with drug 
smugglers. 
  The official referred to the forthcoming meeting in Tehran 
of 
Interpol (International Police) due to be held July 4-6, saying 
it [word indistinct] that Interpol considered Iran [word 
indistinct] was an [words indistinct] role in fighting drug 
trafficking effective. 
  He concluded that 20 countries are expected to attend the 
session which will deal with ways and means of combating drug 
traffickers throughout the region.

  [Text] Three members of a syndicate recruiting youngsters 
to export hard drugs have been arrested in Lagos by the National 
Drug Law Enforcement Agency. The chairman of the task force on 
hard drugs, Brigadier General Musa Baaniyi, made this known in a 
statement. He said the syndicate had recruited a 17-year-old 
student, who was arrested at Murtala Mohamed Airport, to export 
hard drugs to the United States. Gen. Baaniyi appealed to 
parents, guardians, and school principals to monitor the 
activities of their students at all times. He advised those 
with children or wards possessing international passports to 
ensure the safekeeping of the document.

<F P=106> [Article by Mathias Luther: "Organized Crime Has No Foothold </F>
Among Us"] 
  [Excerpt] Turku -- There is no organized crime in the Turku 
area and probably none anywhere else in Finland either. So says 
Mikko Paatero, provincial police commissioner. 
  "An organized crime system requires the population's support 
if it is to function. We are a long way from having that in 
Finland," said Paatero on Thursday [17 February] as he presented 
the 1993 crime statistics for Turku/Pori Province. 
<H5>  More Narcotics Crimes </H5>
  Crime seems to have declined in 1993 in comparison with 
1992, 
judging from the statistics presented by Paatero. This is true 
of all types of crime except narcotics offenses, which were up 
from 374 to 493. But actually, that is also good news, says 
Paatero: the number of narcotics offenses reported always 
depends to a large extent on how hard the police have 
concentrated on combating drugs, and in Turku/Pori Province, 
there was a drive against narcotics offenses in 1993. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Multiyear Sentences in Hashish Case"] </F>
  [Text] Prison sentences of up to seven and a half years 
were handed down in a big hashish case in Helsinki District 
Court on Friday [18 February]. Police seized just over 50 kg of 
hashish in Ristiina and Porvoo about a year ago in connection 
with the same case. 
  The biggest quantity of smuggled drugs totaled 60 kg 
hashish. 
Six shipments of 3 kg had previously been smuggled into the 
country. 
  The court found the two chief defendants guilty of seven 
serious narcotics offenses. Three other defendants were also 
given long prison sentences. 
  The stiffest sentence--unconditional imprisonment for seven 
and a half years--was given to 51-year-old Onni Polvi. He had 
been living in Belgium and had arranged drug purchases in the 
Netherlands. He also transported some of the hashish to Finland 
in his automobile. According to him, the largest drug shipment 
had been transported in a Dutch long-distance truck. 
  The trial took a long time because of the Belgian 
extradition 
procedure. Polvi was arrested in Belgium back in April [1993], 
but could not be brought to trial in Finland until January. 
  Polvi's companion, Rauno Latvala, 48, was given a seven-year 
unconditional prison sentence. Just over 40 kg of hashish were 
seized in his car repair shop in Ristiina in February 1993. 
Latvala had also organized the distribution of the drug in 
Finland. He was helped by his daughter and her husband. 
  The court sentenced 36-year-old Rudolf Rennock to six years 
in prison and 29-year-old Nina Rennock to four years in prison. 
Both of them had sold hashish, mainly in the area around the 
capital. 
  The same case resulted in a five-and-a-half-year prison 
sentence for Ari Muukkonen and a three-year prison sentence for 
Tulan Suzan Josepoff. The court postponed its decision in the 
case of the other five defendants.

  [Text] The Algerian Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] has its 
rearguard in France. The police have uncovered a rear-guard 
logistics network for the Algerian murderers. On 21 and 22 
March, police arrested two FIS sympathizers in Lille, and 
discovered a large cache of false identity papers and other 
documents. A routine drugs search led detectives to this 
important terrorist network. Eric Young has the details: 
  [Young] For the first time, a police investigation appears 
to 
prove the existence of links between FIS sympathizers and the 
drugs world. The network first came to light with a routine 
police investigation of a drugs trafficking network. Detectives 
from the Lille police force spent several days tracking two 
suspects called Shahib and Ahmed. One is Algerian, the other 
French. On 21 March, they were arrested, and it was only during 
their first search that detectives realized they were dealing 
with something bigger. They found more than 1,000 false 
administrative papers at the home of one of the men, including 
500 blank Algerian identity cards. Enlisting the help of their 
Parisian colleagues, the Lille police then carried out a second 
search, this time in Persan-Beaumont in the Val d'Oise, at the 
home of Ahmed. Their haul was enormous. They found documents 
in Arabic linked to the FIS, perfect imitations of Algerian 
official stamps, several handguns, an assault rifle, and a 
significant amount of ammunition. They also found a list of 
telephone numbers, several of which corresponded to people on 
file for drug trafficking. A third man was thus arrested, a 
certain Hassan. 
  It therefore seems clear that the FIS has set up a network 
of 
dealers in France to finance its movement and its actions. The 
sixth division of the criminal investigation department, 
responsible for the repression of threats to state security and 
of subversive activities, has been given the task of 
investigating the affair, under the direction of Judge 
Jean-Louis Bruguiere. It remains to be seen how important this 
network is and to prove how exactly it is passing on its support 
to the clandestine movement in Algeria.

<F P=106> [Benoit Charpentier report: "France Is Supply Base for </F>
Islamic Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] With caution made obligatory by the Kraouche 
syndrome, police officers are continuing their investigations 
into the branches of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] in 
France. Careful to avoid any shows of triumph, they recently 
arrested two suspected sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation 
Front in Lille. 
  At Place Beauvau, as in the 14th Antiterrorist Brigade of 
the 
Paris public prosecutor's office, the affair is considered to be 
"important." Chaib E., an Algerian national, and Ahmed S., a 27 
year-old Frenchman, were imprisoned by Judge Bruguiere for 
"criminal involvement in terrorist action." 
  In the course of a drugs investigation, police officers of 
the Lille regional Crime Squad seized over 1,000 blank Algerian 
administrative documents and a number of weapons. 
  Drugs, the FIS, and false papers--this increasingly common 
cocktail sheds light on both the way in which the fundamentalist 
movement is set up in France and the way in which drugs have 
become a scourge of the Lille region in such a short period of 
time. Its closeness to Amsterdam is a principal reason. 
<H5>  Heroin and Illegal Immigrants </H5>
  In the opinion of one judge, "the Lille metropolitan region 
is an ideal hub for drugs traffickers." Last December, 
investigators dismantled a major network of heroin dealers, 
implicating 47 people, most of them illegal immigrants. They 
had already been working for several weeks on a new heroin line 
when they were taken in for questioning on 21 and 22 March. 
Chaib and Ahmed were ringleaders of a flourishing network that 
offloaded at least 1 kg of heroin every 10 days and which has 
since led to the questioning of 25 people, most of whom have 
been placed under a committal order. This large-scale operation 
had several surprises in store. 
  During the raid on Chaib's home, Crime Squad officers 
dicovered 500 blank Algerian identity cards and 600 blank 
attestations from the High Commission of Algerian national 
service. On the same day they arrested Ahmed, and in a raid on 
his home in Persan-en-Beaumont in Val-d'Oise [Paris region], 
they found an Israeli-made Galil assault rifle, handguns, 
primers and boxes of cartridges for 9-mm automatic weapons, 
stamps for manufacturing false documents, a batch of Algerian 
adminstrative documents, and documents written in Arabic. The 
latter are now being examined by Judge Bruguiere after having 
been passed on to the 6th Division of the Central Crime Squad by 
the Interior Ministry in Paris. 
  These papers immediately attracted the attention of 
antiterrorist experts in the capital. 
  They allegedly prove that the two traffickers are members of 
the FIS. A senior government official in Paris stated: "The 
FIS does not issue membership cards." 
  Their fingers burnt for reasons that are only too-well 
known, 
the police prefer to ironically talk of suspected sympathizers. 
Chaib and Ahmed are, however, thought to belong to the French 
Algerian Fraternity [FAF], one of the FIS' subgroupings which 
was jointly led by Djaffar El Houari and Moussa Kraouche, who 
was also its spokesman. The Lille region appears to be a happy 
hunting-ground for the Islamic fundemntalists. As a judge 
remarked: "It opens directly onto Belgium and the Netherlands." 
Fundamentalism has developed considerably among the region's 
60,000 Muslims, most of whom live in the Roubaix-Tourcoing zone. 
This area has a number of makeshift places of worship as well 
as eight real mosques, some of which regularly welcome over 
1,000 worshippers. The Koran schools are overflowing, and the 
chador is increasingly worn by adolescents. 
  Already on several occasions, police officials have swooped 
on this fertile FIS area. Eight people were taken in for 
questioning during the national haul of last November, while on 
1 March, accused of the same "criminal involvement in terrorist 
action," eight more suspects appeared in Lille before an 
Investigation Commission led by Parisian Judge Roger Le Loire. 
All to no avail. 
<H5>  `Afghans' </H5>
  Magistrates and the police now almost dare to hope that, 
with 
the arrest of Chaib and Ahmed, they will finally be able to 
unravel the threads of a web that seems to be getting more and 
more complex as the months go by. 
  The Kraouche affair proved that there is very little 
evidence 
to catch supposed members of the FIS red-handed. A judge who 
knows these cases well said: "We cannot talk of a centralized 
organization. There are almost as many FIS and Armed Islamic 
Group [GIA] cells as there are regions, even if most 
fundamentalists are to be found in the Paris region, Orleans, 
and, now, Lille." Neither the FIS nor the GIA present a united 
front. 
  Leading the way in terrorist action in Algeria, the GIA 
claimed responsibility for the murder of two French surveyors on 
21 September in Sidi Bel Abbes, and the taking hostage of three 
other French citizens. Its most fanatical members--which 
inlcude the "Afghans," Algerian Islamic fundamentalists who 
fought in Afghanistan--cannot even be controlled by the 
fundamentalist leaders. These fanatics even planned the 
assassination of Rabah Khebir, the FIS spokesman exiled in 
Germany. 
  Judge Bruguiere's investigation will attempt to find out 
whether Chaib and Ahmed played an active organizational role. 
An analysis of the weapons seized should reveal whether they 
were used in France in hold-ups or to settle scores, or even if 
they have been used in Algeria--unless, of course, the two 
suspects turn out to be mere pawns. A Parisian official in the 
antiterrorist squad told us: "Many people orbit the FIS, going 
about their own business, drugs or something else, but helping 
the fundamentalists out with gifts or false documents. Unlike 
the Kurdish Workers' Party [PKK], we cannot formally say that 
the FIS is financed by drugs in France, unless it is indirectly." 
<H5>  Algerians Seeking Asylum </H5>
  In 1993, France recorded a rise in the number of asylum 
seekers from Algeria and Egypt, according to the latest figures 
from the Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless 
Persons (OFPRA). According to the OFPRA, the rise in the number 
of requests by Algerian nationals (1,098 in 1993, as opposed to 
144 in 1990) "is probably due to the arrival of people fleeing 
local instability and persecution by the FIS." However, "as is 
the case for Egyptian requests (up 249 percent)," the rise in 
requests could also be "linked to the reinstitution" of economic 
emigration channels.

<F P=106> [Article by Francois Devina: "Crack Use Spreads Around </F>
Paris"] 
  [Excerpts] The first study done on "pebbles" 
derived from cocaine shows that 14 departments were affected in 
1993 and expresses concern over use by fringe elements. 
  Police and those working in the field of drug addiction have 
long been reluctant to announce the arrival of crack cocaine in 
France due to their fear of generating devastating publicity. 
Opting for the ostrich approach, they were convinced that Europe 
would not be invaded by the type of cocaine used by the 
homeless, accompanied by the ills resulting from immediate 
dependency that spread like wildfire in the United States 
starting in 1986. Exposing the futility of such an approach, the 
first French study of its type is now sounding the alarm, 
stating that "the production and use of crack cocaine in France 
is a major event on the illegal drug scene." [passage omitted] 
  Police in France first began to mention crack in 1989, 
referring to "pebbles" or "Antillean crack" made, not from 
"paste" (cocaine base containing chemical additives), but from 
the purified product and theoretically less harmful than 
American crack. In June 1993, Paris Police Chief Philippe 
Massoni admitted it: "It is true; we are finding crack in the 
capital. Don't expect me to tell you where; I don't want it to 
spread." (FRANCE SOIR interview) In Marmottan Hospital's annual 
report published in February, Dr. Olievenstein observed "an 
obvious spread of the crack market." The French study published 
today confirms the gravity of the phenomenon. 
  Completed on behalf of IREP [.sup]1[/] for the Medical and 
Psychology Association and directed by Dr. Ingold, the study 
immediately confirms that "pebbles" and crack are in fact one 
and the same substance. The ambiguity was used as a sales pitch 
by dealers, which "certainly made it easier for the product to 
enter France initially." From the French Antilles, trafficking 
in crack spread to the Parisian region, appearing first of all 
in the "squats" located in the 18th and 19th arrondissements 
around Line 9 of the Metro between the Republique and Nation 
stops. It then progressed to the area near the Ourcq Canal at 
Stalingrad and in 1992 and 1993 "spread considerably, with 
hundreds of users." By 1993, crack had already been found in 14 
departments around the capital. While recognizing the difficulty 
of estimating the number of users, the study states that in 
Paris "it is reasonable to say that by 1993 they easily exceeded 
the thousand figure." 
  Unlike the majority of the cocaine users, crack addicts are 
often from among the hard-core fringe elements of society. In 
Paris, "a large part of them--although fewer and fewer--are 
Antilleans and Africans. Men clearly comprise the majority and 
the women are generally involved in prostitution. It takes about 
a month for these individuals to go from the experimental stage 
to complete dependency with all its consequences: weight loss, 
pallor, exhaustion, confusion." In addition, more and more are 
former heroin addicts who have switched and they are sometimes 
very young. "Their main drug has changed, even if they continue 
to use heroin in order to tolerate `coming down' better." 
  The IREP study notes "a formidable acceleration in the 
social 
dropout process" of crack users and points to their essentially 
nocturnal way of life. "The stimulating and anxiety-producing 
effects of crack are seemingly incompatible with daytime use. 
`It's too much speed.'" 
  While warning of the risk of crack spreading to the suburbs 
and larger provincial cities, Ingold pessimistically concludes: 
"It is far too late for any kind of an "information" campaign. 
Users will have to see for themselves that crack is an 
infinitely more destructive drug than heroin or other 
substances."

  [Text] L'Isle-Jourdain, France, April 5 (AFP) -- Militant 
farmers have given home-grown cannabis to French Agriculture 
Minister Jean Puech, saying cultivating the drug was the only 
way they had of making a living. 
  The gift was "produced by a French farmer" as his "only way 
of feeding his family," said a communique released in this 
southwestern French town, headquarters of the activist group 
Rural Coordination. 
  In Paris, Puech denied receiving a parcel of cannabis from 
the farmers. "If such a parcel reached me, I would immediately 
hand it over to the police." 
  Criticising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 
farmers' communique said low world prices had forced Third World 
farmers to produce drugs. 
  "By accepting the ratification of GATT, Mr. Puech has opted 
for a world of unemployment, violence and drugs. Farmers will 
adapt their crops to this," the communique said. 
  The gift of cannabis was made to mark the end of Puech's 
first year as minister, the communique said. 
  More than 120 countries will sign the new GATT in Marrakesh, 
Morocco, on April 12-15.

<F P=106> [Jochen Kummer report: "`Struggle for Freedom' of Kurds in </F>
Germany--With Heroin and Blackmail"] 
  [Text] Last week, scenes from Kurdish terrorism on German 
soil dominated television screens and front pages. The 
prohibited terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] turned 
Germany into a theater-of-war: It controlled nationwide highway 
blockades and attacked policemen, it laid fires, and had fanatic 
compatriots set themselves on fire. 
  At the same time, two short police reports were 
inconspicuously carried in the local sections of Hamburg 
newspapers. 
  The HAMBURGER ABENDBLATT reported on 24 March: "For months, 
a group of three young Kurds aged between 13 and 15 years sold 5 
grams of heroin to one addict alone every other day. Now, 
plain-clothesmen have arrested the dealers. They carried 20 
grams of heroin, 30 grams of hashish, and 900 German marks [DM]. 
An arrest warrant had already been issued for the 15-year-old 
boy, who is wanted as a drug dealer. The three Kurds live in an 
apartment for young people in the City of Hamburg." 
  DIE WELT reported on a new case on the next day, 25 March: 
"In St. Georg, plain-clothesmen have caught two Kurdish 
asylum-seekers (15 and 17 years old) in the act of dealing and 
found 55 grams of heroin. The 15-year-old boy was ordered to 
leave the country in 1991, his accomplice is facing deportation." 
  The drug sales to addicts in Germany are one of the most 
important sources of money for the Kurds to finance their 
terrorism in Germany and their struggle against Turkey. A 
second source is the extortion of protection money. 
  These two forms of Kurdish organized crime does not present 
their announcement--that is, that there will be peace again 
after the riots of the past few days, and their violence, which 
they call their "struggle for freedom"--in a favorable light: 
They are part of a strategy. Germany, as a prosperous and 
liberal country, is a financially profitable place of rest for 
the Kurds. 
  As the Duesseldorf Higher Regional Court realized, since 
1984 
Germany has been the European focus of the PKK, which has its 
headquarters in Cologne. About 500,000 Kurds have meanwhile 
settled in Europe--400,000 of them in Germany. About 40,000 
Kurds in Germany are classified as PKK sympathizers and about 
400 as members. They entered the country legally as respectable 
workers with Turkish citizenship, they came as asylum-seekers, 
or they were illegally taken to Germany. 
  It is no problem to accommodate the people smuggled by 
Kurdish gangs: Kurds who ask for asylum here are entitled to 
accommodation, food, and clothing. Those who entered the 
country illegally easily found refuge with clan members, 
friends, or relatives. 
  The commander and secretary general of the Marxist-Leninist 
"cadre party," PKK, is Abdullah Ocalan. According to findings 
of the German intelligence services, he is lodging, together 
with his wirepullers, in Damascus in Syria. 
  "The orders for attacks and demonstrations come from 
abroad," 
Ernst Uhrlau, president of the Hamburg Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution, says. A "Central Committee" of the PKK in 
Europe coordinates the activities; the so-called area committees 
are subordinate to it. 
  By Ocalan's order, the PKK organized six large-scale waves 
of 
attack in Western Europe and Germany in 1992 and 1993. About 
600 perpetrators participated in about 50 attacks in 
European-wide violent actions on 24 June 1993. On 4 November, 
about 60 violent attacks of Kurds on Turkish institutions and 
private houses were ascertained all over the FRG. 
  As a result, the PKK was banned in Germany. The 35 Kurdish 
groups that were prohibited at the same time as the PKK have 
disguised themselves with harmless names, but, according to 
findings of Germany security authorities, they are in reality 
arms of the PKK octopus that are registered as 
"suborganizations" in the local registers of associations, such 
as: "Kurdistan Art and Cultural Center in Nuremberg and 
surroundings--registered association," "Kurdish Women's Center 
in Leverkusen--registered association," "International 
Friendship in Munich--registered association," "Center of Media 
Culture in Hagen--registered association," "Mesopotamian 
Cultural Association in Bremen--registered association," 
"Kurdish Cultural Center in Hamburg and surroundings--registered 
association," etcetera. 
  A Kurd called Kani Yilomaz, who acts on the direction of 
Ocalan, acts as the spokesman of the PKK leadership in Europe. 
It was he who propagated the PKK's preparedness to discontinue 
its violent actions in Germany this week. 
  Apparently, the Kurds' drug deals in Germany yield enormous 
profits for the war against Turkey. This year in January, the 
Frankfurt special commission "Palu" reached the assessment that 
the Rhine-Main area is increasingly becoming the turntable for 
Kurdish heroin smugglers. According to findings of the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigation, Kurds and Turks are the main 
suppliers of heroin. 
  Young Kurds deposited drug money in plastic bags at the 
Lindenstrasse post office in Hamburg. A "Joint Drug Squad" 
(GER) of the customs authorities and the police investigated. 
"Every day, 15-year-old boys came to the small post office and 
deposited cash in plastic bags," a GER officer said in February 
1993. The amounts ranged from DM10,000 to DM200,000 per deposit. 
  The investigators had the money--mainly small bills packed 
in 
newspaper--examined in a laboratory: There was always heroin 
sticking to the bills. The major part of the money was sent to 
a handful of Kurdish men in Bingol, Elazig, and Palu in eastern 
Turkey. According to findings of the police, most of the 
dealers who are arrested in Hamburg's streets come from these 
regions. 
  Within six months, Kurdish dealers deposited DM80 million in 
cash at Hamburg's smallest post office; 187 deposits were 
identified by the GER. The transfer of DM750,000 and DM900,000 
was proved against two Kurdish dealer organizations. 
  In a parallel street of Lindenstrasse, where the post office 
that drug dealers favor for deposits is situated, there is a 
mosque. Since the end of 1992, drug deals had flourished there 
so much that visitors of the mosque repeatedly complained to the 
police. Plain-clothesmen and the mobile police watched the open 
scene for six weeks. 
  An inn near the mosque turned out to be the dealers' meeting 
point. They used the continuous tangle of people around the 
mosque to cover their illegal deals. They acted skillfully 
under the protection of unsuspecting compatriots. In 
mid-February 1993, the police intervened. Seventy Kurdish drug 
dealers were arrested. Arrest warrants were issued for 41 of 
them. More than half of the arrested persons were younger than 
21 years: 26 suspects were between 14 and 16 years old and 17 
suspects were between 17 and 21 years. Apparently, three 
children aged between 12 and 13 years were used as drug couriers. 
  Kurdish children, some of whom arrive as "unaccompanied 
refugee children," prove to be well instructed: If they are 
seized by the police as not criminally responsible drug dealers, 
they will not be bothered by German punitive justice. The 
social welfare offices of the districts are responsible for such 
children, for example, in Hamburg. As is shown by the 
above-mentioned police report, the City of Hamburg provides such 
Kurds with apartments for young people. 
  The roads of Kurdish money transfers seem to be 
inexhaustible. Policewomen found DM45,000 in the brassieres and 
panties of Kurdish women when they were subjected to carefully 
directed checks at Fuhlsbuettel airport in Hamburg. The spicy 
aspect of the case was that the women belonged to a family who 
had flown in from Palu in Turkey at the expense of the German 
state, in order to identify a Kurdish drug dealer in court. 
  The second special field of the Kurds is the extortion of 
protection money. With this method, they cash donations for 
their political struggle. 
  In Berlin, where 50,000 Kurds live, Kurds and Turks are so 
active in this field that the police established a special 
investigation group in March 1993. Hans-Ulrich Voss, managing 
director of the Berlin Criminal Investigation Department, 
described how the collection of donations works: "First" PKK 
representatives approach businessmen "very politely" and ask for 
"donations" for the struggle for liberation. DM200 are 
requested from owners of kebab stalls, while owners of travel 
agencies and insurance agencies have to pay up to 
DM20,000--these amounts are often requested every month. 
  Turkish private persons are visited at home late at night. 
Their donations are calculated according to the size of the 
Turkish family's car. Hesitant victims are brought to heel by 
referring to one's knowledge of the children's route to school. 
  The shop windows of those Turks who still refuse to pay are 
broken or incendiary devices are thrown into the shops. With 
such attacks, the Kurds achieve a welcome additional effect: 
According to initial appearances, German right-wing extremists 
are initially blamed for such attacks. 
  However, the Berlin special investigation group discovered: 
"Collectors of donations" from Turkey, not--as originally 
assumed--xenophobic Germans, are responsible for many destroyed 
shop windows and arson attacks in Berlin-Kreuzberg. 
  According to Berlin experiences, only about 10 percent of 
the 
victims admit that they have been blackmailed; 10 percent claim 
that they pay "voluntary donations." The rest, 80 percent, are 
silent. 
  In Frankfurt on Main, the Municipal Office granted licenses 
for 2,500 "public houses and restaurants"--40 percent of which 
were to foreigners. Frankfurt senior detective officer Roland 
Ullmann estimates that "there is hardly anybody who does not 
pay."

  [Text] Police in Stockholm fear a new wave of African 
"swallowers," i.e., people who smuggle heroin-filled condoms in 
their stomachs. Five drug smugglers of this kind have been 
arrested so far this year. 
<H5>  Half a Kilogram of Heroin </H5>
  The latest arrived in Stockholm by ferry via Russia and 
Finland. The Finnish police thought they knew what was going on, 
but instead of arresting the Tanzanian, they shadowed him on the 
trip to Sweden. When he reached Stockholm the Swedish police 
took over. 
  The suspect took a taxi to a residential address in southern 
Stockholm where a fellow countryman was waiting. At that point 
the police moved in. It eventually turned out that the suspect 
was indeed smuggling heroin. He was carrying about half a kg in 
his stomach. 
<H5>  Traffic Gains New Momentum </H5>
  Superintendent Lars-Erik Karlsson, chief of the narcotics 
division in Stockholm, revealed that this African smuggling 
activity started two summers ago. Since then around 40 couriers 
have been caught when they came to the Nordic region. Last year 
the traffic seemed to die down somewhat, but after the arrest of 
five people in the first two months of this year alone, Karlsson 
fears that a new wave is on the way. 
  The smuggling routes have varied. Some have come by plane, 
others by boat. Karlsson is convinced that the smuggling is 
organized. A common feature is that the drugs involved are brown 
smokable heroin from Pakistan. Some of the couriers were loaded 
up, as Karlsson puts it, in Africa while others swallowed their 
smuggled cargo in Istanbul, Turkey. 
<H5>  Two Already Sentenced </H5>
  Two of the five people who have been arrested so far this 
year have already been sentenced. One, who smuggled in 587 
grams, was sentenced to five years in jail plus lifetime 
expulsion. The other, who was carrying a record 667 grams, 
received a sentence of 5.5 years plus lifetime expulsion.

  [Text] The police in Huddinge have succeeded in cracking an 
entire cocaine sales organization in six stages, from the 
supplier in South America to the pizza baker who handled local 
sales in southwest Stockholm. 
  There are 18 suspects in all and the judicial examination of 
the activity has been divided into several trials. Three people 
have already been sentenced, nine more were indicted a few days 
ago. Another five people are awaiting indictment in a couple of 
weeks and District Prosecutor Ronnie Jacobson hopes that the 
ringleader, a Peruvian who was arrested in Chile at Sweden's 
request, will be turned over to Sweden a month from now. 
  "It is quite unusual to get hold of the entire pyramid, in a 
manner of speaking. This is the result of a combination of 
confessions and surveillance observations on the part of the 
police," Jacobson said. 
<H5>  Police Intervention in November </H5>
  The police stepped in for the first time last November. They 
zeroed in on a pizzeria. The police suspected that cocaine was 
being sold there and had therefore kept track of traffic to that 
location. 
  The pizza baker, who handled local sales, got the drugs from 
a regional salesman, who in turn got them directly from a man to 
whom a female courier delivered her smuggled goods. 
  The volume of drugs the man in custody in Chile sent to 
Sweden in this way is not yet clear. A total of 5 kg of cocaine, 
worth about 5 million kronor in abuser circles, has been 
confiscated in the course of the investigation. 
<H5>  11 Years for Drug Dealing </H5>
  Svea Appellate Court has sentenced a Swede who has lived in 
South America for several years to 11 years in prison for 
exporting substantial quantities of cocaine to Sweden. 
  Swedish drug agents have long regarded the Swede, 
29-year-old 
Stefan Orning, as one of the worst suppliers of cocaine to the 
Swedish market. He was arrested in Colombia about a year ago and 
as he did not oppose extradition it was possible to send him 
back to Sweden relatively quickly. 
  The appellate court sentence of 11 years in prison means 
that 
Stockholm City Court's earlier sentence in the case has been 
upheld. The appellate court also upheld the sentence of nine 
years in prison for 28-year-old Anders Bennback. In addition, 
three young men received prison sentences of one, three, and 
four years respectively. 
<H5>  Large Amount </H5>
  The appellate court described Orning's acts as especially 
serious with reference to the substantial amounts of cocaine he 
has handled and the fact that he carried out the activity on a 
commercial scale for a long period of time. Back in 1988 when 
two young Swedes on their way home from South America were 
caught with 4 kg of cocaine when they arrived at Arlanda, the 
investigation indicated that it was their friend Orning who had 
supplied them with the drugs. 
  That smuggling attempt is one of the shipments for which 
Orning has now been sentenced. The charges against him involved 
a total of around 20 kg of cocaine. 
  Despite the fact that Orning's activity has stopped, there 
is 
no sign that the flow of cocaine from South America has 
diminished, according to Superintendent Nils Jornsten of the 
Stockholm Police Department's drug division.

  [Text] Acting on information, the teams affiliated with the 
Gendarmerie Command in Van halted and searched a car near the 
village of Sevindik in the Guzelsu locality. The vehicle, 
license plate 34 PKU 20, was taken to the guardpost in Guzelsu 
for a more thorough search. The officials discovered 5 kg of 
heroin and a Colt handgun under the seats and another 25 kg of 
heroin in secret compartments. The driver, Zeki Gunes, revealed 
that the vehicle and the narcotics belonged to an Iranian, Riza 
Shahpuri, and that the car and the narcotics were delivered to 
him on Turkey's border with Iran. 
  Gunes said he was to drive the car and deliver it to 
Shahpuri 
in Istanbul. He said German marks are used to buy and sell 
heroin in east Turkey, adding: "We would buy each kilogram for 
11,000 German marks and sell it for 17,000 German marks in 
Istanbul." 
  The impounded heroin has a market value of 50 billion 
Turkish 
lira. The drugs belong to the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] to 
which the profit was to be transferred.

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Igorev: "Pot Suppliers: Of All Means of </F>
Transportation, the Most Important For Us Is the Subway"] 
  [Text] Moscow militia officers yesterday completed 
another operation in interdicting illegal drug trafficking. As a 
result of this operation more than 20 kg of drugs and raw 
materials for their manufacture were confiscated from 
criminals. 
  As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at the Moscow GUVD 
[City Administration of Internal Affairs], the greatest 
consignment of narcotic raw materials was confiscated in the 
lobby of the Kiyevskaya subway station by the Fedchik 
brothers--officers of the UVD's 3rd Department for Subway 
Security. They detained Ukrainian citizen Igor Belov; during the 
subsequent search, 13 kg of poppy straw was found in his 
possession and confiscated. At the same time, at the 
Komsomolskaya subway station operatives detained Rostov Oblast 
resident Igor Roshchin, on whom they found--and confiscated--500 
g of marijuana. In addition, 30 g of poppy straw, four liters of 
pervitin, and a sawn-off shotgun were found in the possession of 
watchmen at an industrial warehouse on Dorozhnaya Street. 
  According to militia data, suppliers of drugs and materials 
for their manufacture have changed their tactics lately. They 
now do not go directly to Moscow from contiguous states on 
long-distance trains but instead disembark in oblast centers 
such as Kaluga or Tula. From there they usually hitch a car ride 
to the capital. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the year 
militia personnel have confiscated about 200 kg of poppy straw 
at Kievskiy Railroad Station alone. According to operatives, the 
size of the average supplier's consignment of poppy straw these 
days is 60-70 kg.

Against the Narcotics Business"] 
  [Text] On 29 March, a meeting of the recently created 
coordinating headquarters of the law enforcement bodies in the 
Kartli region was held in Gori. The heads of the region's law 
enforcement structures participated in its work. On account of 
the worsening situation concerning the narcotics business, 
methods of resolving this problem were outlined at the meeting 
and a plan of action was adopted. In this regard, mixed groups 
made up of representatives of the Ministry of Security, the 
military police, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs were 
created. These forces will control all points of entry into and 
out of Tskhinvali [administrative center of south Ossetia] in 
order to prevent narcotic substances from coming into the 
republic from the northern Caucasus.

<F P=106> [Article under the rubric "Crimes and Punishments" by Juozas </F>
Aras: "Narcobusiness Spreading in a Menacing Fashion"] 
  [Text] A few years ago, I had occasion to drive with 
officials of what was then the militia to "apprehend" a little 
old lady, who, with poppy capsules clutched to her bosom, was 
waiting near the Virsuliskes shopping center for "some man in a 
black overcoat" to show up. After she was taken to the militia 
station, the old woman moaned: "Let me go, I knew Snieckus 
himself: I was in the underground with him..." 
  Later I got to drive through the streets of nighttime 
Vilnius 
in an ambulance transporting a young man crazed by narcotics to 
the hospital, who kept yelling the whole time: "My head! Give me 
back my head!"... 
  It is difficult to say, even using the terminology of that 
other time, to what extent these events represented a "mass 
phenomenon" or, on the other hand, "isolated instances." When 
the staffers of the current Interior Ministry counternarcotics 
section visited their colleagues in Denmark, the Danes noted 
almost in jest: "You don't see the problems until you begin 
working at this." 
  Statistics show that the Danes are correct. 1990 was the 
year 
in which the fewest narcotics-related crimes were committed--in 
that year, a reorganization of the Interior Ministry system was 
taking place, and the police were pulled away from their actual 
duties to meetings and other events. In the following year, a 
special counternarcotics group was established in the criminal 
police, and individual agencies and customhouses began to work 
more consistently. And in 1993, 302 narcotics-related crimes 
were recorded, which represented a 26 percent increase over 
1992. This number, however, is not the limit: to get a true 
picture, we would have to multiply it by 10. 
  The charted curve of these crimes is increasing not only in 
length, but also in breadth, and the geographical area they 
affect is expanding as well. Every third crime recorded in 
Lithuania is committed in Vilnius. However, crimes are committed 
in the other large cities as well--Kaunas, Klaipeda, Panevezys, 
Siauliai, Visaginas, and Druskininkai. Of late, some new trends 
are becoming apparent: narcotics-related crimes are also moving 
into rural districts such as Anyksciai, Kupiskis, Pasvalys. 
Border districts are not spared either. 
  Every tenth organized crime group is involved in 
narcobusiness, and quite a few group members, even some of their 
leaders, "are on the needle." A certain category of criminal is 
starting to appear: the narcotics transport courier. Despite all 
this, narcobusiness can still not claim the same degree of 
organization as prostitution, which has existed here under all 
governments. According to one Interior Ministry official, who 
wished to remain anonymous, narcobusiness is still a new 
phenomenon in Lithuania. A couple of years ago we were afraid 
that we might become the bridge for narcotics between the West 
and the East. It looks like this has not occurred, but the 
situation is changing in menacing fashion. 
  The route through the Balkans is already uncomfortable--the 
war going on there creates supplementary worries for the 
narcotics transporters. This is why it is thought that the new 
route might go through the Baltic countries. The aforementioned 
official characterized the situation in this way: there are no 
concrete facts, but there have already been some signals. For 
the time being, events are concentrated along the border with 
Latvia, Kaliningrad, and Belarus. Narcotics transit Lithuania 
on the "Moscow-Kaliningrad" train. Lithuanian poppies, the 
primary narcotic, are transported not only to Latvia, Estonia, 
Saint Petersburg, and Moscow, but have also already reached 
Sweden. The largest quantity of narcotics encountered last year 
by our criminalists consisted of bags containing 60 kilograms of 
poppy capsules. We are now talking in terms of tens of 
kilograms, even though one kilogram of narcotics is already 
considered to be a large quantity. Cases involving quantities of 
up to 10 grams of narcotics are subject to the provisions of the 
administrative code, with quantities in excess of 10 grams 
falling under the criminal code. 
  A new narcotic appeared in circulation recently, when traces 
were found in one addict's syringe. And incidentally, statistics 
tell us a few things about the addicts themselves. 42 percent 
are 30-49 years of age, 30 percent are 25-29, and 25 percent are 
18-24. 72 percent of addicts do not work anywhere. Keeping in 
mind that this is an expensive amusement, the majority of 
addicts encounters serious difficulties, because a jar of poppy 
capsules costs 25 litas at the market, and the total outlay 
approaches 50 litas when the cost of acquiring the most 
essential supplemental chemicals is included. And that is just 
for one day. So the knowledge of life indicates that narcotics 
are the cause of many a crime (thefts, robberies, even murders), 
and there are now few days without them. 
  To tell the truth, it would be quite strange if the 
situation 
were any different, because one could say that the laws tolerate 
everything: from growing narcotic substances to using them. 
Article 107.2 of the "Administrative Code" provides for a 
penalty of from 50 cents to 1 litas for the planting and growing 
of narcotic substances, and article 44 provides for a penalty of 
up to 1 litas or correctional labor--which is not used by anyone 
as a punishment--for illegal acquisition and possession of small 
quantities of narcotics, or their use. So maybe one politician 
of the not so distant past was correct when he said that only an 
utter fool cannot earn money in these times. 
  Although the time for sowing of poppies and hemp is still 
far 
off, advance contracts are possibly already being made with farm 
inhabitants: I'll give you 8,000 litas now, and you will give me 
a field of 10 ares [editorial note: 1 are equals 100 square 
meters] planted with poppies later. Such fields cannot be seen 
in the summer even when you drive by, because they are either 
hidden by bushes or by grain planted along the edges of the 
plot. There are fields of poppies which are specifically 
guarded. This is not new, but rather an element of a classic 
structure. Unfortunately, the police are powerless, because they 
are not authorized to write up an administrative report. Only 
agricultural workers can do that, but of course thus far not a 
single one of them has done so. 
  We do not believe that such laws are being drawn up 
maliciously. The men in the government lack foresight. People 
are simply living for the day. In this case, however, society's 
view is not correct either. Poppies are certainly more dangerous 
than, let us say, marijuana, because opium-based narcotics are 
used intravenously--and this is a real way in which AIDS is 
spread. 
  For many, poppies are just blossoms. What are we going to do 
when the fruit suddenly appears as well?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Attack Launched Against Drug Use"] </F>
  [Text] Chiefs of law enforcement agencies in 
Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast have long warned of the fact that the 
region is becoming a raw material base for drug addicts and 
traffickers from both Ukraine and the CIS. The number of people 
using drugs (primarily youths) or entering the narcotics 
business is increasing. The directive "On the Program of 
Combating Drug Abuse and Illegal Circulation of Drugs in the 
Oblast for 1994-1997" issued by Vasyl Pavlyk, the president's 
representative in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, is intended to counter 
this vice. 
  In particular, the program provides for the regular holding 
of prevention operations code-named "Poppy" and "Doping," which 
are designed to detect and stem channels through which drugs and 
psychotropic substances are entering illegal circulation. 
  Considerable attention is being attached to procedures to 
prevent young people from getting involved with narcotics. In 
addition to awareness programs, it is also planned to ensure 
proper opportunities for young people to utilize their leisure 
time. The question of returning education and training 
facilities rented to private enterprises and organizations will 
be considered. 
  It is also expected that the sore problem of isolating drug 
addicts will be resolved. A specialized facility will be 
established this year in Ivano-Frankovsk, and it will have 
separate wards for compulsory confinement of drug addicts and 
minors using drugs.

  [Text] As the Ukrainian Border Troops press service has 
reported today, the last day on the Ukrainian-Moldovan border 
was quite tense. Soldiers of the Kotiv Border Control Squad 
prevented an attempted contraband of 10 tonnes of diesel fuel to 
Moldova, and at [words indistinct] Border Troops soldiers 
detained a truck with 20 tonnes of coal which Moldovan citizens 
attempted to transport to Moldova. Attempts to smuggle firearms 
and drugs through our borders also continue. For example, a 
Nagan gun and ammunition for it were found with a Kazakhstani 
citizen, and in Sumy Oblast, while searching the Kiev-Moscow 
train, Border Troops soldiers uncovered almost 3 kg of heroin. 
All the cases are currently under investigation.

  [Text] The current Bolivian administration blames the 
previous administration for the negative report issued by the 
U.S. Government on the results of drug enforcement efforts in 
Bolivia. Our reporter Mario Espinoza has some information: 
  [Begin recording] [Espinoza] The executive branch believes 
the negative U.S. Government report on drug enforcement in 
Bolivia focuses on the first part of 1993. Social 
Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado has said the report 
contains positive aspects. He added that during its 1993 
electoral campaign, Bolivia indisputably failed to fulfill its 
commitments to the U.S. Government. 
  [Machicado] I would like to underscore three aspects. First, 
the United States will continue to cooperate with Bolivia--be it 
in drug enforcement or in any other area where cooperation 
exists. Everything will remain the same, there will be no change. 
  Second, the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia states that coca 
eradication was delayed entirely due to the administration of 
former President Jaime Paz Zamora, especially during the 
electoral campaign. Prior to the 1993 elections, the former 
Patriotic Accord administration decided to stop coca eradication 
efforts in the Chapare region basically for political and 
electoral reasons. 
  The third aspect is that the U.S. report clearly 
acknowledges 
the efforts of the current administration which has led to the 
arrest of several drug bosses and the breaking up of large drug 
rings. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Antonio Suarez, president of the National 
Association of Judicial Employees, and Gabriel de Vega, director 
of the National Drug Directorate, commented on the U.S. State 
Department's harsh, controversial report. 
  [Begin recording] [Suarez] We have been criticized for not 
having a strong enough hand, but we have a list of 262 judges 
and employees assassinated in Colombia. We would not have a 
long history of bloodshed if we weren't doing something. The 
U.S. State Department's remarks are interfering and an attempt 
to meddle in Colombia's administration of justice. That is why 
we, just this once, support the prosecutor general's policy. 
  [De Vega] As far as my office is concerned, the report is 
objective and measured. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (DPA) -- Colombian Senate 
President Jorge Elias today asked the U.S. Government and 
judicial authorities not to meddle in his country's internal 
affairs. Elias was referring to criticisms made in Washington 
on the methods used to reduce the sentences of drug traffickers 
who surrender. 
  Elias, from the ruling Liberal Party, defended the system 
implemented by President Cesar Gaviria while noting that it was 
copied from the method that has been used in the United States 
for several years. 
  "The United States showed us the rules for surrendering to 
justice, the informers, the sentence reductions. We are 
following them here in Colombia," the congressman said in 
statements to the press. 
  The Senate president's position came in the wake of 
criticisms from the U.S. State Department on the "short" 
sentences for drug traffickers and on the contacts between 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and Cali Cartel attorneys. 
  According to newspaper articles from Washington, the State 
Department believes the Colombian justice system is corrupt and 
is weak before the powerful drug traffickers. It is now in the 
hands of the U.S. Congress to decide whether to suspend judicial 
aid. 
  U.S. officials and spokesmen for the Colombian Prosecutor's 
Office said that in the past weeks the U.S. legal authorities 
stopped sending evidence to Santa Fe de Bogota against drug 
traffickers as a form of protest over statements by de Greiff, 
who said that repression is failing as a means of fighting drug 
trafficking. 
  De Greiff favors legalization of the drug trade as a 
strategy 
to dismantle the drug traffickers' multi-million dollar 
business. His ideas are questioned both in Colombia as well as 
the United States. 
  According to the Senate president, Colombia is a free, 
independent country that can decide if it wants to continue 
using sentence reduction for those who surrender. Since 1990, 
approximately 20 drug traffickers have availed themselves of 
this system. 
  Elias pointed out that U.S. judicial authorities "should be 
more concerned with their own problems--because they have a lot 
of them--before they make outrageous, unsubstantiated 
criticisms." 
  The decrees signed by Gaviria at the beginning of his 
administration provide for a significant sentence reduction for 
criminals who surrender, confess to at least one crime, and 
cooperate with justice. 
  De Greiff has been in contact with the attorneys of Gilberto 
Rodriguez, who is accused of being a Cali Cartel leader and is 
considering turning himself in.

  [Excerpts] Today the "National Newscast" learned about the 
U.S. State Department's annual report on the struggle against 
drug trafficking. 
  The report places the country in the dock and notes that 
corruption is widespread in Colombia, particularly in the 
judicial branch. [passage omitted describing contents of report] 
  The policy of surrendering to justice which the State 
Department criticizes has also been a controversial issue in 
Colombia. 
  We consulted congressmen who approved the Penal Procedure 
Code: 
  [Begin recording] [Senator Hernan Echeverri] We politely 
reject this insinuation and this sort of U.S. intervention in 
our domestic affairs. 
  [Representative Ramiro Lucio] The Colombian Congress, 
autonomously--without consulting the U.S. State Department, the 
Belgian Justice Ministry, or any other authority anywhere in the 
world--decided to approve the Penal Procedure Code basically 
including the antidrug policy that the national government 
presented to us. 
  [Senator Alberto Santofimio Botero] What is happening is 
that we are increasingly losing our sovereignty. We are going 
to wind up asking the gringos what we are to do in order to 
issue laws in Colombia. 
  [Representative Edmundo Guevara] It is easier to see the 
mote in your brother's eye than to see the beam in your own. It 
is in the United States where sentences are negotiated. We 
copied from them. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (EFE) -- The Colombian 
Prosecutor General's Office today rejected charges made by the 
U.S. State Department that the Cali Cartel has infiltrated the 
Colombian government. 
  On 4 April, the State Department published its annual report 
on its global strategy to fight drugs. With regard to Colombia, 
the report states among other things that the mafia "still 
manipulates the judicial system through intimidation and 
bribery." 
  Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura denied this 
allegation, saying that arrests, sentences, confiscations, and 
seizures prove the opposite is true. 
  "Such a general claim is unacceptable," Sintura stressed in 
a 
news release. 
  Noting the achievements made by the Prosecutor General's 
Office, Sintura said it is not clear who the report refers to as 
a "fourth-level member of the (Colombian) Prosecutor General's 
Office who is under investigation for his alleged links to the 
Cali Cartel." 
  The news release says that in 1993 "Colombia extradited a 
presumed Argentine drug trafficker to the United States, as well 
as four citizens of various nationalities during 1994. In 
addition, seven others whose extradition was requested by the 
United States were arrested, and those cases are currently 
moving through the legal process." 
  Sintura adds that as a result of the fight against drug 
trafficking, 40 people linked to this crime have surrendered, 30 
have been arrested, and 23 have been killed in clashes with the 
authorities. The news release stresses that all of these people 
were "members of drug trafficking organizations, and not common 
criminals." Sintura's report adds that "17 top leaders of these 
organizations have received sentences of 10-24 years in jail."

  [Text] Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura a 
few minutes ago commented on the U.S. State Department report 
criticizing the Colombian judicial system and the policy of the 
Prosecutor General's Office regarding the surrender of drug 
traffickers. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Sintura, has 
the prosecutor general capitulated in favor of drug traffickers 
in Colombia? 
  [Sintura] That is not true. A communique that we released 
clearly presents the Prosecutor General's Office position, which 
is this: As long as the existing law forbids drug trafficking 
in every stage, the Office will continue to fight drug 
traffickers and charge them in courts of law. 
  [Reporter] Does the United States have the moral authority 
to 
censure us like this? 
  [Sintura] Well, these are comments that one sovereign state 
makes to another. We have said a few things that we think are 
important, particularly because we understand that the 
generalizations made about the Colombian judicial system can be 
based on either incorrect interpretations of our legal system or 
insufficient reports. [end recording]

  [Text] San Jose, 4 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Security 
Minister Luis Fishman today played down a U.S. State Department 
report that "money laundering" and drug trafficking and 
consumption are on the rise in Costa Rica. 
  Fishman said the report admits that "there is virtually no 
corruption" in Costa Rica's police force, which is prevented 
from taking more effective action against drug trafficking by a 
lack of financial resources. "I am proud because they say there 
is no corruption," the minister told ACAN-EFE, saying that 
contrary to what Washington says, Costa Rica has dealt "harsh 
blows" to drug traffickers in recent years despite the limited 
resources. 
  Fishman said he "disagrees" with the assertion that Costa 
Rican policemen are unprofessional. He said that Puerto Limon 
on the Atlantic coast is a problem area and added that many 
resources have been allocated to fight drug trafficking and 
consumption. 
  The State Department's annual report, released today, 
highlighted the progress made by Central American governments, 
with the exception of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in the fight 
against drug trafficking and money laundering. The report says 
that the "laundering of drug money" is particularly serious in 
Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, but virtually nonexistent 
in El Salvador. 
  The State Department gave Guatemala the most praise for its 
cooperation with Washington in several campaigns to eradicate 
cocaine and opium and to arrest drug traffickers. According to 
the State Department, meager resources and a lack of 
professionalism among security services preclude significant 
progress in the counternarcotics struggle in Costa Rica. 
  The report says that Puerto Limon has become the main point 
of contact between the Colombian island of San Andres, the 
Nicaraguan coast on the Caribbean, and the United States. At 
the same time, however, the report said there is virtually no 
corruption.

  [Text] Representatives of the Cuban and Argentine 
Governments have signed, in Havana, a bilateral cooperation 
agreement for monitoring and preventing drug addiction and drug 
trafficking. The document was signed at the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry by Alberto Lestelle, Argentine programming and 
coordination secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and for 
the antinarcotics struggle, and Cuban Minister of Justice Carlos 
Amat. 
  In exclusive statements to journalist Josefa Bussi, the 
justice minister talked about the U.S. State Department document 
that acknowledged Cuba's cooperation in the struggle against 
drug traffic. 
  [Begin Amat recording] Well, we read the statements. We have 
assessed this as something positive, because it does recognize 
the effort our country has been making--and is continuing to 
make, despite the existing difficulties in turning into concrete 
action all these things that, actually, have to do with the 
political will to fight drug trafficking, thinking not only of 
our own people but also about all mankind. We think that, 
indeed, this recognition could constitute the possibility of 
continuing to enter deeper into [continuar profundizando] the 
relations that, in an unofficial way, are being established at 
certain moments with that country's authorities. And, in the 
last analysis, it is indeed everyone's duty to continue working 
in that direction. [end recording] 
  According to the specialists, Cuba's cooperation in this 
struggle extends to intercepting planes and ships in its air and 
maritime space, as well as in supplying information to the U.S. 
services in charge of confronting that problem.

  [Text] Washington D.C., 4 Apr (PL) -- The United States 
today recognized Cuba's cooperation in the struggle against 
international drug trafficking in a U.S. State Department 
document on the issue. 
  In an annual report on worldwide drug production and 
trafficking, the U.S. Government corroborates that Cuban 
authorities continue placing top priority on their anti-drug 
policy, and it also indicates that Cuba cooperated with the 
Unites States in this area in 1993. 
  According to Washington's opinion on how the nations of the 
world are meeting the commitments made at the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, the report contends Cuba is engaged in a struggle 
against drugs, despite the island's problems of fuel shortages 
and the lack of spare parts, all of which limit Cuba's capacity 
to combat drugs. 
  Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention on this issue and 
has signed bilateral agreements with many nations in the region 
to fight the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  Also, in 1988 it declared its willingness to sign an 
agreement of this type with the United States--an offer which up 
until now has been ignored by Washington. 
  Cuban cooperation in this struggle includes the interception 
of planes and ships in its airspace and territorial waters, as 
well as the supply of information to U.S. services in charge of 
confronting this problem. 
  The United States is the world's largest drug consumer, and 
the report admits that although cocaine continues being the main 
threat to U.S. drug users, the danger of the use of heroin is 
growing at an alarming pace.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "The Path of Truth Opens </F>
to Cuba"] 
  [Text] Havana [no date as received] -- For the third time 
in three years the U.S. Government has recognized Cuba's serious 
efforts and efficiency in the antidrug-trafficking struggle in 
or near the island's territorial waters and airspace. 
  On the first occasion, an AP wire dispatch reported on 7 
March 1991 that Washington "stated today in an official report 
the antidrug campaign initiated by Cuba almost two years ago in 
its territorial waters and airspace has aided in reducing 
narcotrafficking in the Caribbean." 
  The State Department report, always cited by AP, admitted 
that in 1990 "the Cuban Government continued to maintain its 
policy of denying Cuban airspace and territory to the (narco) 
traffickers, and there was broad evidence of its efforts begun 
in mid-1989 which curbed drug trafficking." 
  Later, on 12 April 1993, a NOTIMEX wire dispatch reported: 
  "A U.S. State Department report published earlier this month 
recognizes Cuba's cooperation in controlling drug trafficking in 
1992." 
  "The Cuban Government continues to give a high profile to 
its 
antidrug policy, part of which has been substantiated by 
actions, the U.S. branch report stated." 
  Now, on Monday, the Spanish news agency EFE announced from 
Washington that a U.S. State Department report on international 
narcotrafficking stated the Cuban Government continues to grant 
priority to its antidrug policy and that in 1993 it cooperated 
with the United States, "the largest drug consumer in the world." 
  That same document admitted that in the past five years, 
heroin consumption increased in the United States. The document 
noted that due to this, heroin narcotrafficking in Latin America 
has been diversified. 
  According to the U.S. State Department, of all the threats 
entailed in drug trafficking the greatest is its unlimited 
capability to corrupt institutions, among other things, because 
only the value of the drugs confiscated in the United States is 
superior to the gross internal product (GIP) of many countries 
of the hemisphere. 
  Amid this assessment, the U.S. Government added in the 
report 
published this week that Cuba signed the UN 1988 Drug Convention 
and "is working to fulfill many of the convention's objectives." 
  Interestingly enough, the U.S. State Department assessment 
finds somehow that Cuba's antidrug-trafficking efforts may 
possibly have not been more extensive because of the blockade 
imposed by the White House on the island more than three decades 
ago. 
  In this sense, the official analysis notes that the scarcity 
of fuel and essential spare parts limits the Cuban Government's 
ability to intercept drug traffickers. 
  As known--it has been generally promoted by the extreme 
rightist sectors of Miami and other Conservative groups in the 
United States--one of the campaigns used insistently against 
Cuba internationally has been to link it with narcotrafficking. 
  This is the third report issued by the U.S. State Department 
on the topic since 1991 in which objectivity prevails above any 
distorting propaganda. The report offers a highly valuable tool 
to anyone who seeks to assess the seriousness of arguments used 
by Cuba at the time that it has to explain its actions or refute 
those who professionally attempt around the clock to distort its 
present situation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Drugs: U.S. Assessment"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. State Department report on international 
drug trafficking is revealing in the sense it escapes the 
intentions of its writers. It exposes the weaknesses, 
incongruities, errors, and interference by the selfsame U.S. 
drug policy and shows, in that respect, Washington has gone from 
militarist attitudes of the Bush administration to something 
very close to inconsistency. Examples of that are: Although the 
U.S. State Department deplores the inefficiency or lack of will 
on the part of the governments of Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and 
Lebanon, among others, in the counternarcotics trafficking 
struggle, it refuses to place them on the list of "punished" 
nations, such as Iran, Syria, Burma, and Nigeria, for reasons of 
"national security;" that is, for reasons totally removed from 
the drug topic. 
  The U.S. document praises the Colombian Government for 
killing Pablo Escobar, top leader of the Medellin Cartel, 
despite the fact this, as well as other actions by Bogota 
authorities, did not significantly reduce the production and 
trafficking of cocaine, nor did it prevent the recent illegal 
production of heroin. In other words, the exhaustive violence 
unleashed in Colombia by the government's war against the 
Antioquia band has caused infinite deaths but has not reduced 
drug trafficking. In another sense, the report criticized 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, a man of renowned moral 
authority in Colombia, for negotiating with certain 
narcotraffickers the reduction of their sentences in exchange 
for their surrender. U.S. officials can hardly condemn this 
practice, however, when it is a daily practice in U.S. courts 
for prosecutors to offer the accused, whether or not they are 
narcotraffickers, more lenient sentences, acquittals, and even 
money and protection in exchange for information. 
  Continuing with the examples, the U.S. State Department has 
stated the Peruvian Government is plagued by vast corruption, 
which makes it difficult to fight drugs, but does not say a 
single word about the same phenomenon in the United States. It 
omits the fact that only the corruption of government employees 
can explain the massive entry of drugs to the nation which 
consumes the most drugs in the world. 
  Panama's case merits separate mention. With the pretext of 
fighting narcotrafficking, Panama was invaded violently by U.S. 
troops, a country whose institutions were destroyed and in which 
puppets to Washington's liking were placed in power. They are 
the same ones now accused by the State Department of doing 
nothing to eradicate the laundering of drug money. This fact 
constitutes either a demonstration a priori of how false the 
Bush administration arguments were or proof the interfering 
imposition of pro-U.S. governments is no guarantee that that 
drug policy will meet U.S. demands. 
  After viewing the confused, partial, and interventionist 
nature of the report issued yesterday in Washington, the 
inclusion of Mexico on the list of nations that "have complied" 
is encouraging only in the sense it can be considered a 
guarantee that U.S. authorities will not use the 
narcotrafficking topic as a pretext to exert undue pressure 
against our country, as they have done other times. The 
assessment of Mexico's counterdrug struggle and achievements, 
viewed as important and commendable, corresponds solely and 
exclusively to Mexicans' sovereignty and no foreign government 
has the legal or moral authority to give "grades" on this or 
other domestic issues. 
  Finally, and strangely enough, it should be noted the U.S. 
Government in its report is capable of setting aside its 
anti-Cuban phobia, giving a report devoid of ideology, although 
no less interfering, on the efforts by the Havana government in 
the counternarcotics trafficking struggle. Concerning the rest, 
the document presented by the U.S. State Department yesterday 
depicts a combination of deplorable attitudes, which hinder 
reaching international agreements that are needed to confront 
the drug plight with a global, multilateral spirit, to attack 
simultaneously consumption, production, and the illegal sale of 
drugs, respectful of sovereignties.

  [Text] National Police Chief Fernando Caldera said 
yesterday he did not have any details concerning a U.S. State 
Department report that charges Nicaragua has made little 
progress in its struggle against drug trafficking and money 
laundering. Nevertheless, Caldera said, "the Nicaraguan state 
has made progress in its fight against drug trafficking--a fight 
that started from nothing." 
  Caldera indicated that in Nicaragua drug trafficking is a 
relatively new crime. The police chief said: "Drug 
consumption, particularly cocaine consumption, is a new element 
that has increased significantly in the past two years with 
trafficking." 
  He said this kind of criminal activity has increased 116 
percent. "These actions have increased significantly since 
1993," the high-ranking police officer asserted. 
  Nevertheless, Caldera explained that last year the National 
Assembly began discussing a draft drug fighting bill, which he 
termed modern. He also stressed that last year the government 
created the National Antidrug Commission, while police created 
the Narcotics Directorate. 
  "We now have a higher level of coordination with the DEA and 
Central American police forces," Caldera remarked as he recalled 
that the amount of drugs confiscated has increased sharply. "We 
are not yet doing everything we can, but the foundations have 
been laid," he pointed out. 
  Caldera explained that the U.S. DEA does not have an office 
in Managua, "but we maintain a close, cooperative relationship." 
He insisted a large publicity campaign will be needed to fight 
drug trafficking and consumption, but he warned that there will 
not be enough resources this year to undertake such a campaign. 
  Caldera said he wants "all of us" in Nicaragua "to develop a 
social disapproval for those engaged in drug-related activities 
in order that these people do not acquire the levels of 
notoriety they have in other countries in which there is a 
certain status attributed to narcotraffickers." 
  The police chief added there are abuses by some judges who 
lend themselves to the objectives of drug traffickers. "These 
are very rare cases, and they do not mean that everyone within 
the judiciary branch is in on it," he explained. 
  In addition, Caldera admitted some policemen have been 
punished for collaborating with drug traffickers, and he 
reiterated that police organizations are determined to fight 
these crimes. 
  The police chief said money laundering is an activity that 
is 
very easily detected in our country, although he admitted it 
might take place on a small scale in Nicaragua. "Dollars are 
laundered everywhere, even in the United States," Police Chief 
Caldera concluded.

  [Text] With approval of the new narcotics law being debated 
by the National Assembly, Nicaragua will establish the legal 
framework for combating drug trafficking more efficiently, but 
the law alone is not sufficient, Deputy Carlos Gallo, chairman 
of the Human Rights Committee, has said. We need resources and 
assistance even from the U.S. State Department. 
  [Begin Gallo recording] The State Department can help in 
obtaining assistance for Nicaragua's police apparatus to combat 
it. You know how precarious the National Police budget is. [end 
recording] 
  The law is also being drafted to fight money laundering, 
which has not taken hold in Nicaragua. 
  [Begin Luis Humberto Guzman, Christian Democratic Union 
deputy and National Assembly president, recording, in progress] 
...the report does not review the volume of financial 
transactions in Nicaragua's banks. We could not necessarily 
talk of money laundering; at least not for now. [end recording] 
  Nicaragua has not reached the level of drug trafficking of 
other countries. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] Perhaps Nicaragua's only 
implication 
is that its territory and air space are used as a 
drug-trafficking and transshipment point. [end recording] 
  The law may be passed in the next four weeks. Controversial 
topics will be DEA operations in our country and the extradition 
of nationals, something our Constitution bars.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] Although they were unfamiliar with the details, 
various official sectors of the country have rejected the U.S. 
State Department's International Report on Narcotrafficking 
Control Strategy, which states in 1993 "Nicaragua showed little 
progress" in the antidrug-trafficking and money-laundering 
struggle in the country. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais has said that the 
report 
"does not accurately reflect" the Nicaraguan situation and that 
"the U.S. State Department had told Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry 
officials Nicaragua was not a country that caused concern" 
regarding drug trafficking. 
  "Furthermore," it added, since the date of the report until 
today, "Nicaragua has shown important progress in cooperating to 
confront international narcotrafficking problems." 
  The U.S. document, to which BARRICADA gained access, states 
the National Police has delayed the antidrug-trafficking 
struggle and conducted its first operation, "jointly with the 
DEA" in early 1994. 
  Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar has recalled that 
John 
Maisto, U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua, had sent a letter 
congratulating the police corps for its antidrug-trafficking 
struggle. 
  The annual report also states "the extension and importance 
of drug trafficking in Nicaragua is not fully known," but "there 
are hardly any doubts Nicaragua's tremendous financial and 
political problems make the country an obvious target" of 
narcotrafficking. 
  A ranking police source has agreed that undoubtedly a large 
amount of drugs passes through our country, air space, and 
across our sea. 
  The source added: "Concerning Nicaragua, one cannot speak, 
however, of official authorization of narcotrafficking flights 
or official protection groups for cocaine-unloading operations." 
  The report has criticized Violeta de Chamorro's government 
for not progressing as the United States wants "in fulfilling 
the UN Convention of 1988, not passing new counternarcotics 
laws, not adopting measures against government corruption, and 
not progressing in bilateral and regional agreements signed in 
previous years." 
  "It recognizes as facts, however, that Nicaragua is part of 
the executive secretariat of the Central American Antinarcotics 
Commission, that the Banco Central demands documents verifying 
transactions exceeding $10,000, and that a counternarcotics 
police unit has been created." 
  Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar has said "there is no 
evidence of money laundering in Nicaragua," as the U.S. State 
Department claims. 
  A police source has agreed with Cesar. "We cannot certify 
there is money laundering in Nicaragua." The source added the 
police cannot conduct an investigation "as long as there is no 
law authorizing us to do so." 
  Luis Humberto Guzman, National Assembly president, has said 
that thus far, for lack of economic means, the legislative 
branch has not conducted an investigation on money laundering. 
  He said: "If one examines the amount of financial activities 
in Nicaraguan banks, we cannot speak of money laundering." 
  The U.S. report adds "although the Nicaraguan Government 
promised in 1992 to present a law, according to the UN 
Convention of 1988, it decided not to use any political capital 
for it." 
  The report added Nicaraguan legislation on the topic is 
"obsolete," because it defines the problem as a "health" problem. 
  The National Assembly has learned of a draft bill which, 
because of its complex nature, is taking awhile. It is hoped 
the law will be ready in eight weeks. 
  Guzman has said the U.S. State Department "has false 
information" on the narcotrafficking situation in Nicaragua and 
that the deputies are "doing what we must regarding this topic 
(of narcotrafficking)."

<F P=106> [Report by Fidelina Suarez] </F>
  [Text] The price of the dollar on the parallel market 
dropped 1 percent in the past three months, and the current 
shortage of cash (cordobas) in circulation has led to a dollar 
surplus. For that reason, exchange houses are selling the 
dollar at 6.65 cordobas. Managers of the 14 exchange houses 
that operate in the country and the people who sell dollars on 
the streets are concerned, for they have been unable to make 
major operations due to a shortage of cordobas. 
  Exchange houses have even bought the dollar at a price 
higher 
than the official rate, which yesterday was set at 6.53 
cordobas, whereas in other cases the dollar was sold for 6.52 
cordobas. "The price has not settled since last year, when we 
closed with a selling price of 6.65 cordobas to the dollar," 
Multicambios General Manager Jose Dolores Gomez has said. 
  In addition, the U.S. State Department released a report 
criticizing the Nicaraguan Government for its lack of initiative 
in controlling "money laundering" and drug trafficking. The 
State Department report stated "money laundering" is especially 
serious in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. "There is no doubt 
Nicaragua's tremendous financial and political problems make it 
the perfect target for drug traffickers," the document has 
stated. 
  Nicaraguan Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada denied 
"money laundering" is done in Nicaragua through the national 
financial system. "The Superintendency of Banks and Other 
Financial Institutions and the BCN [Central Bank of Nicaragua] 
follow up every day all the transactions conducted through the 
financial system and exchange houses, and there are no 
large-scale operations indicating to us that money laundering is 
taking place," he said. 
  Taboada said that based on the stability observed in bank 
transactions, there is no possibility that "money laundering" is 
done that way. "For example, there is no evidence huge amounts 
of money have been withdrawn from the financial system 
overnight," he said. 
  Concerning the dollar surplus, the official said the 
dollarization of the economy still persists in the country, 
mainly in sectors that in some way sense instability. "Certain 
people cannot forget about the inflation and devaluation period, 
although we insist the situation has changed. We hope they will 
feel more secure with the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility], so we can reverse this 
sentiment," Taboada said. 
  At the start of Holy Week, the price of the dollar had 
dropped to 6.60 cordobas. The exchange house Multicambios did 
not miss the opportunity of selling it at up to 6.55 cordobas 
yesterday. "We need cordobas, and that is why we often have to 
sell at that price, barely a point above the official price, 
which today (yesterday) was 6.53.77 cordobas," Gomez has said. 
  Exchange dealer Miguel Angel Mendieta said that before Holy 
Week, the market experienced a dollar surplus and a cordobas 
shortage. "We believe this is caused by the economic crisis. 
People who have dollars are selling them to survive, but only a 
few are buying to save them as they did before," Mendieta has 
said. Gomez said the surplus and shortage in demand will lead 
to a dollarization of the economy. "The balance has been broken; 
more people are selling dollars, and there are few cordobas to 
purchase them," he has said. In certain cases the profit margin 
of certain exchange houses was four cents, but that has dropped 
to one cent for the above mentioned reasons. Most of the 
exchange houses have cut back their levels of operations. 
  Alejandro Solorzano, Exchange Houses Association [Asociacion 
de Casas de Cambio, Asocambio] president, attributed the 
situation to the shortage of liquidity. "The trend is now toward 
more people with dollars and fewer with cordobas. We are almost 
working at the official price," he added. According to 
Solorzano, the chief problem is that the exchange houses lack 
the capacity to give incentives to buyers as they did before. 
"The slow circulation of dollars is hurting the market," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Panamanian President Guillermo Endara by </F>
Jenny Lee Martinez and Manuel Fernandez from the Bridge of the 
Americas in Panama City on 7 April--live relay] 
  [Text] [Martinez] President Endara dedicated the widening 
of the Panama-Arraijanj Highway today. Before the dedication, 
President Endara commented on U.S. accusations Panama is not 
doing enough to fight drug trafficking. The U.S. Government 
accuses the Panamanian justice system of releasing drug 
traffickers. Here is President Endara's response: 
  [Endara] [Words indistinct] how many drug traffickers it 
does 
not free? It frees hundreds, not to say thousands of drug 
traffickers. The Panamanian judicial branch--the United States 
Government had better get this from now on--is not controlled by 
the executive branch, as it is not in the United States. The 
U.S. justice system frees many more drug traffickers [words 
indistinct] the Panamanian justice system. 
  [Fernandez] Do you suggest [words indistinct]? 
  [Endara] The U.S. justice system? 
  [Fernandez] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Endara] And why do they not talk about corruption in the 
United States? They free more drug traffickers than Panama. 
Why do they accuse us Panamanians? Why is our justice system 
charged with corruption if it frees two drug traffickers? Why 
do they not talk about corruption over there? 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Endara] I am not justifying the acquittal of any drug 
trafficker. What I am saying is, no matter what the United 
States does, the executive branch will not intervene in matters 
concerning the judicial branch. The executive branch will not 
intervene in the judicial branch. If the judicial branch frees 
someone, we will free that person because that decision concerns 
the judicial branch, as per the same policy President Clinton 
follows vis-a-vis the U.S. judicial branch whenever it decides 
to free a drug trafficker. If President Clinton respects and 
heeds the U.S. justice system, I want to tell President Clinton 
I also respect and heed my justice system. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Endara] [Word indistinct] we will continue the task. This 
is a momentary [words indistinct]. For now, we will follow the 
same path. 
  [Martinez] There will be a lack of U.S. cooperation. 
  [Endara] If they do not want to cooperate, we can do nothing 
about it. They are the ones who consume the drug, and they are 
the ones who have created a problem for us in Panama. The most 
consumption takes place in the United States. Because the drug 
passes through here, some of it remains in Panama, and it 
affects our youths. If they do not help us, what can we do?

  [Text] According to a report released yesterday by Robert 
Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American 
affairs [title as heard], Panama's dollar-based economy, the 
existence of a free zone in Colon Province, loose control over 
the exchange of money and raw material, and lenient laws have 
made Panama vulnerable to drugs, 
  The report states that the Panamanian Government has not 
made 
any new, decisive efforts to curb the laundering of drug money 
in the past year; that Panamanian laws must be perfected; and 
that Panama's control organizations and resources are inadequate. 
  According to a U.S. State Department report on international 
drug trafficking presented to the U.S. Congress, a number of 
countries, including Panama, are victims of corruption fostered 
by drug traffickers. The Panamanian Government has rejected 
this accusation several times, saying that it is making all 
possible efforts. Vice President Guillermo Ford thus reacted to 
the report: 
  [Begin Ford recording] I am going to say this publicly and 
through our embassy. In 1990 the Republic of Panama issued a 
decree-law by which the Banking Commission would introduce rules 
to govern the management of cash through banks. Recently, 
through a cabinet decree, a new law was issued involving all 
assets coming into Panama through any port of entry. All 
countries are doing this. 
  Meanwhile, Panama approved the Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty, which has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. I think 
that instead of criticizing and promoting the idea that Panama 
supports drug trafficking and money laundering, we should all 
work together to eradicate these two scourges. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. Government says that cocaine 
consumption has become a true worldwide scourge that corrupts 
and destroys lives, and it has accused Panama of lacking the 
political resolve to deal with the corruption caused by the drug. 
  [Begin Ford recording] I must say publicly that I think it 
is unfair to say that Panama is not doing enough to eradicate 
this scourge. [end recording]. 
  The State Department report asserts that drug production and 
trafficking are increasing and creating new opportunities for 
international criminals. In addition to Panama, the report 
lists Bolivia and Venezuela among the Latin American countries 
that are not making an effort to fight drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Report by Abdiel Antonio Gutierrez from the "RPC Television </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Panama will request a meeting with U.S. authorities 
at the highest level to discuss the laundering of money from the 
illegal sale of drugs. Members of the Foreign Relations Council 
held an urgent meeting with President Guillermo Endara to take a 
stand on the report issued by Robert Gelbard, assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, which describes 
our country as an important money laundering center. After a 
meeting that lasted two and a half hours, the Panamanian 
Government officially rejected the high-ranking U.S. official's 
report that Panama's efforts to combat money laundering have 
been small. 
  [Begin Foreign Minister Jose Mulino recording] We will also 
request a meeting at the highest level of the U.S. Government to 
discuss the drug issue. This issue must be broached, not only 
in regard to Panama, but also with respect to the United States, 
which is the country that consumes this product the most. [end 
recording] 
  He added that the Panamanian Government does not intend to 
argue the issue but wants to begin a constructive dialogue to 
correct possible errors in the management of the money 
laundering problem. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] Those issues do not stay at a 
bilateral level. It is offensive and denigrating for our 
country to be identified as one of the world's principal money 
laundering centers. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister announced that he will send Panama's 
official statement on the matter to U.S. officials early next 
week. In his opinion, the report tarnishes the country's image 
among nations.

  [Text] "The statements by Robert Gelbard, U.S. deputy 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, are 
vague and ambiguous when he says Panama is a drug 
money-laundering center," Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said 
yesterday. 
  Mulino said: "Gelbard's statements are not specific and shed 
no light on the faults committed by Panamanian authorities." 
  The foreign minister said "the administration's report does 
not give names and places where the illegalities occur." 
  Mulino says "the case to which the document alluded was the 
raid on the Gil Cafe Company, but added there was no sustaining 
evidence in the fact." [sentence as published] 
  For his part, Supreme Court Magistrate Jose Manuel Faundes 
cited "the strange U.S. attitude of discrediting Panama's image 
before the concert of nations." 
  Faundes has stressed the national authorities' cooperation 
against drug trafficking, a situation that can be brought up in 
the face of any accusation on the part of the United States. 
  The magistrate has said "Panamanian international financial 
centers have controlled money laundering, something to which 
U.S. banks can attest." 
  A U.S. delegation is visiting the country and is being 
escorted by Olegario Barrelier, president of the National 
Banking Association (ABN). 
  This visit will last until 11 April, according to 
Barrelier's 
agenda.

  [Text] Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate of the 
"National Consensus Alliance," said yesterday the United States 
has assumed an irresponsible attitude in saying Panama has not 
cooperated in the antidrug-trafficking struggle. 
  Galindo said that efforts are being made in Panama to 
cooperate in the antidrug-trafficking struggle and that the 
United States has exaggerated in saying the contrary. 
  "We are all intent on ending drug trafficking and money 
laundering once and for all in our country, because it is 
difficult to say it will end, but it is incorrect to say nothing 
has been done," he said. 
  The presidential candidate said there are authorities who 
are 
trying to fight narcotrafficking, but he added there are groups 
of criminals who attempt to evade the security system, because 
Panama is a country with vast coasts along both oceans, which 
makes it even more difficult to control. 
  Galindo also mentioned the charges against the former 
government. He said Panamanians cannot live permanently in the 
past but must learn from experiences from the past and look to 
the future, because otherwise "we will be living in the past, 
and the future will be the one that will lose."

  [Text] Presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles rejected 
accusations by some U.S. sectors linking Panama to international 
money laundering. According to Carles, Panamanians cannot 
accept everything that comes from the United States. A report 
issued by the U.S. assistant [secretary] of state for 
inter-American affairs states that Panama is one of the 
countries that offers the least cooperation in controlling drug 
trafficking and money laundering. Panamanian authorities have 
staunchly rejected this position. 
  Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles, who describes 
himself as a friend of the United States, also rejected the 
allegations. 
  [Begin Carles recording] I agree with the position taken by 
Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Raul Mulino. Panama is 
cooperating in the counternarcotics effort. The enormous 
quantities of drugs seized is one indication that things are 
like they used to be, when trafficking was openly protected by 
Panamanian authorities. [end recording] 
  According to Carles, there are some isolated cases, but they 
are not enough to warrant the accusations being made against 
Panama. 
  [Begin Carles recording] We can not accept everything the 
Americans ask or demand of us. There are interests here in 
Panama that must also be defended, like the banking center. Of 
course money laundering is a crime, but it originates in the 
United States, so let us both struggle against it. They signed 
the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which Panama has already 
ratified but the United States has not. [end recording]

  [Text] Carlos Felipe Escobar, chairman of the Legislative 
Assembly Drug Control and Eradication Committee, believes the 
United States is also responsible for the existing drug problems 
in Panama, because the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) was 
approved two years ago, but the U.S. Senate still has not 
ratified it. 
  Three days ago, Robert Gelbard, U.S. deputy assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said Panama has 
become a "very important" center for the laundering of 
narcodollars. This prompted the Panamanian Government to 
prepare a protest note which will be delivered this week to the 
authorities of President Clinton's administration. 
  "MLAT is shelved, because there are senators who have been 
unwilling to approve the treaty, which would permit both 
countries (Panama and the United States) to conduct operations 
to counter the drug problem," the president of the assembly's 
drug committee said. 
  For his part, Rodrigo Arosemena, former customs director, 
has 
said the Panamanian authorities have countered drug trafficking 
but if the U.S. authorities do not want to accept this fact, 
they should offer proof indicating otherwise.

  [Text] According to Legislator Leo Gonzalez, it is unfair 
for the U.S. Government to say that drug money laundering in 
Panama has increased. What must be done to dispel all doubts is 
to update all laws dealing with this matter. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] Panama has done an excellent job. 
Customs, the PTJ [Technical Judicial Police], and the National 
Police have confiscated large amounts of drugs. A number of 
narcotraffickers have been captured, the country has cooperated 
with the U.S. Government, and the DEA works unimpeded here, 
which I think is all right. We must admit, however, that we 
have lagged a little regarding money laundering. We have 
experienced trouble with money laundering because of our banking 
center and the Colon Free Zone. [end recording] 
  The Legislative Assembly is making every effort to approve 
the new drug bill as soon as possible. Gonzalez said it is 
urgent to pass money laundering legislation as soon as possible. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] The only weak link in our 
legislation has to do with money laundering, for which we will 
have to pass special legislation. Yet we are moving in that 
direction. This fight against drug trafficking will not end 
overnight. The important thing is that we are taking firm steps 
to solve this problem. [end recording]

  [Text] U.S. authorities have been accusing our country of 
being a center for regular and abundant drug-related money 
laundering. They have done this without, in any instance, giving 
specific details regarding the persons, place, and time the 
actions have taken place. In addition, they have done it 
indirectly, without denoting the attitude of a serious 
government such as that of the United States, a country seeking 
to end that illegal business. The U.S. accusations indicate a 
rather obvious intention to tarnish the country so as to free 
itself partly of the social stigma of currently being the 
largest drug consumer worldwide. 
  If instead of trying to raise "doubts" regarding the 
reputation not only of our country, but also of other nations on 
the continent, Washington tried to outline joint strategies to 
solve this serious problem, then the sincere will of the U.S. 
Administration to stop the illegal business of those who come to 
our countries to "clean up" would become evident. [sentence as 
published] Then those countries, and their governments, 
including Panama, would have a greater chance to succeed in this 
fight against the negative forces of the U.S.-fed thriving and 
powerful drug enterprise. These countries south of the Rio 
Grande could never generate so much money because they do not 
have it; and if they had it, they would use it to satiate the 
overwhelming hunger of their peoples and not to use and abuse 
cocaine, marijuana, and their many byproducts. In this serious 
war, Washington should be the one to set an example for the 
other participants.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry in </F>
Caracas on 6 April] 
  [Text] Given the distorted reports transmitted by certain 
foreign news agencies and subsequently published in a local 
newspaper on 5 April on the "Annual Report on the Drug Control 
Strategy at the International Level" presented by the U.S. State 
Department to the U.S. Congress, which lists Venezuela among the 
leading drug producing countries and countries used most often 
as transshipment points for drugs, the Foreign Ministry has done 
an in- depth evaluation of the aforementioned report and states 
the following: 
  1. The report and list refer to countries, Venezuela 
included, that are victims of the drug problem and which have 
cooperated fully with the United States or adopted their own 
measures to achieve full compliance with the goals and 
objectives of the 1988 UN Convention Against the Illegal Traffic 
of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. The preparation of 
the aforementioned report is foreseen in the U.S. Foreign Aid 
Law and allows a confirmation of the various categories of 
countries affected by the drug problem that may continue to 
receive U.S. aid. 
  2. As the report indicates, Venezuela is one of the 
countries that has offered exemplary cooperation in the struggle 
against drugs. The U.S. State Department recognizes this when 
it admits that "Venezuela is not a narcotics producing country; 
it is only used as a transshipment point for drugs going from 
Colombia to the United States and Europe." This categorically 
denies the negative reports spread by certain biased foreign 
news agencies that included only certain parts of the report in 
question. 
  3. Moreover, the U.S. Government recognizes the efforts made 
by Venezuela, a country that has endorsed the 1988 UN Convention 
Against the Illegal Traffic of Narcotics and Psychotropic 
Substances that was ratified in 1991. Furthermore, our country 
has signed 23 bilateral agreements that include most of Latin 
America, the Caribbean, and North America as well as several 
Western European countries in coordinated efforts and policies 
for the prevention, control, and repression of the illegal 
traffic of narcotics and psychotropic substances. In addition, 
on a multilateral level, Venezuela is part of the 1961 Single 
Narcotics Convention, the 1971 protocol which modifies this 
convention, the South American Accord on Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances (ASEP), and the Lara Bonilla Accord 
among Cartagena Agreement member countries. It is also actively 
working on programs of the Inter-American Commission for the 
Control of Drug Abuse (CICAD/OAS). 
  4. Likewise, Venezuela is a among the pioneer Latin American 
countries which promulgated the 1984 Basic Law on Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances, which was revised in 1993 to include 
almost all the Model Regulations for the Control of Precursors 
and Chemical Substances, Machines, and Elements prepared by the 
CICAD. Moreover, the current law on this issue was adapted to 
the terms of the 1988 Vienna Convention. 
  5. Within this same context, and as acknowledged by the U.S. 
State Department report, the Venezuelan Government's struggle 
against the illegal traffic of drugs has been permanent and 
systematic. Referring to this issue, measures have been taken 
to equip the state's security organizations, and special 
financial investigation divisions have been created in the 
Technical Judicial Police (PTJ), Directorate of Intelligence and 
Prevention Services (DISIP), and the Armed Forces of National 
Cooperation. 
  6. In addition, seminars and conferences have been held in 
Caracas this year to examine the drug problem, including the one 
recently held by the CICAD on the "Use of Capital Resulting From 
the Illegal Traffic of Drugs," and the first Latin American 
Congress of Drug Experts, under the auspices of the U.S. Embassy 
and the Jose Felix Ribas Foundation. Furthermore, the country 
was visited by the executive secretary and assistant secretary 
of the International Narcotics Supervision Board (JIFE) on 21-25 
March for a firsthand look at the drug situation in Venezuela. 
Those individuals expressed their recognition of the work being 
done in this country. 
  7. As proof of the permanent struggle against that scourge, 
the state's security organizations seized 3,405.197 kg of drugs 
in 1993: cocaine (1,704.883 kg); bazuko (1,160.898 kg); 
marijuana (526.26 kg), heroin (12.686 kg), and hashish (0.500 
kg). Moreover, 12,309 people were arrested as a result of those 
seizures and Police operations; and charges were filed for drug 
consumption (10), drug possession (9,931), and drug trafficking 
(2,368). 
  8. To conclude, the Venezuela Government wishes to reassert 
its firm decision to continue the struggle against drugs, and it 
avails itself of the occasion to request the same cooperation 
from the other countries of the international community, 
particularly the government of the United States of America, a 
country with which we have excellent relations of friendship and 
cooperation. Venezuela is not a drug producer but it is 
suffering the consequences of the illegal trafficking of 
narcotics and psychotropic substances, particularly the 
laundering of dollars generated by drug trafficking activities. 
It is time to face the problem together, not through a 
misrepresentation of the facts or slanderous charges, but with 
serious efforts focused on strengthening the actions against 
this terrible scourge.

  [Text] "Corruption is everywhere here. It is an obstacle 
to many things in addition to the counternarcotics effort. 
Anything said about corruption in Venezuela is no 
exaggeration." Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made those 
statements in Congress, where he was called to answer questions 
about a U.S. State Department report that corruption in 
Venezuela hinders the fight against drug trafficking. 
  The interior minister clarified that he had not read the 
report in question and did not have any details on this specific 
case. He did say, however, that "corruption is a very leafy 
tree in Venezuela." 
<H5>  The Legislators </H5>
  For his part, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, representative of the 
Social Christian Party and chairman of the Chamber of Deputies 
finance committee, said he had read that corruption hindered 
counternarcotics efforts just as it negatively affected any 
other government action. 
  The legislator added that he had not read the State 
Department report, which has only appeared in the press, and 
thus could not comment "on a report that only mentions Venezuela 
in a few lines. I prefer that Venezuela be evaluated by 
Venezuelans." He admitted that this type of report negatively 
affects the government. 
  MIN [National Integrity Movement] legislator Gonzalo Perez 
Hernandez said that if the U.S. Government has such information 
on Venezuela "it is probably true, because it is hard to believe 
that drug traffickers do not know the importance of politicians 
in quieting investigations that could take them or their 
representatives to jail." 
  He added that drug traffickers promote corruption in the 
government security organizations to keep drug traffickers from 
being punished. "If the United States has the names of people 
and institutions at the service of drug traffickers in our 
countries, it should identify them to help us combat drug 
trafficking and the corruption it generates."

  [Text] About 400,000 of Taiwan's 20 million residents are 
addicted to drugs, according to a report by the Bureau of 
Investigation. The bureau said that it has seized a total of 
1,300 kilograms of heroin last year, which was sufficient to 
supply 32,000 drug addicts for one whole year. But the seizure 
only reflected about one-tenth of the overall drugs smuggled 
into Taiwan, indicating that about 400,000 people here are 
addicted to drugs. 
  The bureau also flatly denied the report by the United 
States 
State Department that Taiwan is Asia's largest way station for 
drug shipment. Citing a record 336-kilogram heroin seizure last 
May, the Bureau of Investigation said that Taiwan will not allow 
drug barons to turn the island into a transfer port for drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] Taipei, April 8 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou Thursday [7 April] criticized a U.S. State Department 
report on Taiwan's alleged role in international drug smuggling 
and said the Justice Ministry will ask the State Department to 
clarify the allegations. 
  Ma said conclusions about Taiwan found in the summary of the 
1993 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report ran counter 
to details in the report's appendices. 
  The summary depicted Taiwan as a market and transshipment 
point for Southeast Asian heroin and a safe haven for drug 
fugitives. Taiwan was also said to be producing illicit 
amphetamines and increasingly playing a role in money laundering. 
  In the appendices, however, Taiwan is not listed as a major 
drug producing, manufacturing trafficking or money laundering 
nation, contrary to some foreign wire reports, he said. 
  Ma criticized the report's conclusion that Taiwan is a safe 
haven for drug fugitives. He blamed this misunderstanding on 
the lack of an extradition agreement between the U.S. and 
Taiwan. The problem can be easily resolved by signing an 
extradition treaty, he said. 
  Ma added that the Justice Ministry will see to it that a law 
to prevent money laundering is enacted as soon as possible to 
put an end to the crime in Taiwan. 
  Meanwhile, Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau Director 
Wu Tung-ming denied reports that Taiwan is a major drug 
producing and trafficking country. 
  Wu explained that Taiwan is actively cracking down on 
illicit 
drug trade and abuse, has implemented laws and regulations to 
control drug-related crime, and is stepping up international 
drug smuggling information exchanges.

  [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan has mobilized its 
resources to fight a war against narcotics, which has already 
paid off handsomely, Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou said 
Wednesday [6 April]. 
  In 1993 alone, Ma pointed out, more than 6,400 kilograms of 
drugs were seized here. The amount far exceeds seizures 
recorded in previous years, he noted. 
  In addition, the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau 
has foiled a number of drug trafficking efforts with the help of 
international cooperation and information exchanges, he stressed. 
  As an international business operations center, Taiwan has 
been used by drug traffickers as a transshipment point, he added. 
  The minister pledged that the government would spare no 
effort in combating the drug problem. 
  Moreover, he said, Taiwan's anti-drug efforts have won 
recognition from the United States. 
  The 1993 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 
issued by the U.S. State Department Monday said that authorities 
in Taiwan are increasingly involved in combating the rapidly 
growing drug abuse problem, and that Taiwan's drug laws are 
being strengthened. 
  "In 1993 there were no reports of corruption in connection 
with narcotics law enforcement in Taiwan," the report said. 
  Ma made these remarks while fielding questions at the 
Legislative Yuan. 
  Meanwhile, Director Wu tung-ming of the Investigation Bureau 
said that a report made by a U.S. House of Representatives 
delegation last year also praised Tawian's efforts in dealing 
with drug issues. The delegation visited Taiwan last August for 
an anti-drug meeting. 
  Taiwan has done a good job in customs inspection, Wu 
asserted, saying 14 percent of containers entering and leaving 
Taiwan are inspected, compared to the United States' 12 percent. 
  The war against narcotics calls for increased information 
exchanges and increased international cooperation, he stressed.

  [Text] Tehran, April 7, IRNA -- Commander of the Law 
Enforcement Forces and secretary of anti-drug campaign 
headquarters Brigadier General Reza Seyfollahi said here today 
that [words indistinct] claim regarding alleged Iranian flippant 
attitude towards drug trafficking revealed that Washington was 
worried about Iran's success in this area. 
  The U.S. under-secretary of state claimed Tuesday [5 April] 
that Iran and Syria were not serious in their anti-drug campaign. 
  Talking to IRNA, Seyfollahi said that the anti-drug efforts 
by various Iranian organizations particulary the law enforcement 
pesonnel and especially in the border areas with Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, had been admired several times by the international 
organizations. 
  He said that the international drug smugglers conducted by 
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) earned billions of 
dollars for the U.S. annually, however, as a result of Iran's 
vigorous campaign against the transit of drug to Europe and 
America via that Iranian territory, the U.S. Administration has 
suffered huge losses he added. 
  Seyfollahi said the U.S. by raising directed and calculated 
claims [passage indistinct] 
  He noted that the traffickers are generally equipped with 
the 
advanced U.S.-made weapons, and that a big part of the 
international drug trafficking operations are carried out under 
the financial and arms supports of the U.S. 
  "The U.S. and persons like [UN Human Rights Commission 
Special Representative Reynaldo] Galindo Pohl who are under the 
influence of U.S., have times and again forwarded the unfounded 
claims that Iran executes political prisoners under the name of 
drug traffickers, in a bid to prevent Iran's decisive measures 
against narcotics."

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard 
Monday [4 April] contended that the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Nigeria, Burma, and Syria are either collaborating in drug 
trafficking or are not taking preventive steps in this regard. 
  Of course this is not the first time that Washington has 
levelled such charges in an attempt to counter the independent 
policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the past, too, 
propaganda tactics such as production of nuclear weapons, aiding 
international terrorism, and violation of human rights have been 
repeated time and again. 
  Apparently, the U.S. State Department has asserted a new 
charge on account of the earlier subjects getting old. This 
subject alleges that Iran has not helped prevent the drug 
trafficking destined for Europe and America. The charge is 
being levelled at a time when numerous reports have already been 
released by international agencies on the successful campaign 
launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran against production and 
sale of drugs. Included among them are the recent comments of 
Mr. George Canary, executive director of the UN drug control 
program stationed in Vienna [name and title as received]. He 
has declared that Iran is making fervent efforts to combat drug 
trafficking. Also mention can be made of the recent report of 
the international department for drug control, whose officials 
toured the bordering areas of Iran and Pakistan. The report, 
which has been released as an official document of the United 
Nations, has said: Even though Iran is not at the highest level 
in terms of per capita investment on drug control, it is very 
close to this point. The report also stresses that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is actively carrying out an anti-drug campaign 
on regional and international level. 
  It should be mentioned that Islamic Iran, which is itself a 
victim of the attacks by the drug traffickers, has launched 
widescale efforts to combat the merchants of death during the 
past years, and tens of thousands of its security forces have 
laid down their lives in fighting the drug traffickers who try 
to smuggle narcotics from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe and 
the United States. 
  Official figures indicate that the amount of narcotics 
seized 
in 1979 stood at 11,000 tonnes, whereas in 1992 it reached 
66,000 tonnes, which reflects a remarkable success. More 
interesting is the fact that when the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
in order to uproot the drug trafficking, brings to the gallows 
the drug lords who have been involved in the trade for years, 
the U.S. Administration and its allies condemn Iran for 
violating the human rights. 
  In the end, one can only say that in this connection 
Washington's political scandals are so clear that there is 
hardly any need for a further look at its performance. It would 
suffice to remind that it is the United States where the heroin 
manufacturing plant makers are living, and where the big drug 
barons are based with their widescale resources.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Drug Culture"] </F>
  [Text] The United States has produced another list of 
countries that it claims are not cooperating with its anti-drug 
trafficking efforts. Not surprisingly, Iran is included in the 
list, and according to U.S. sources, will not be eligible for 
receiving "U.S. aid" or U.S. support in obtaining loans from the 
World Bank. 
  Iran is using its own resources to fight drug producers and 
smugglers, and the effort is costing the Islamic Republic 
heavily, both in monetary and in human terms. Dozens of Iranian 
security forces members are killed or injured by drug smugglers 
every week, and the country is overstretching its financial 
resources in trying to cut the flow of drugs through its 
territories. This is no easy task since the border between Iran 
and Afghanistan, where most of the contraband is cultivated and 
transported to the U.S. and the European markets, stretches for 
hundreds of miles, and due to its remoteness, is extremely 
difficult to control. 
  Despite U.S. antagonism and Iran's own financial and 
technological limitations, the Islamic Republic continues to do 
its best to combat drug smuggling through its territory. Iran's 
Interior, Minister Mohamad Besharati, today announced the 
completion of a 30 Kilometer trench along Iran's eastern border 
where most of the illegal drugs enter Iranian territory. 
  The most important aspect of this issue is the fact that 
according to Western beliefs regarding the free market principle 
of supply and demand, supply will dwindle and vanish if demand 
is eliminated. 
  The voracious appetite of Americans for all kinds of drugs 
is 
a well known fact. Some U.S. administrations have made 
superficial attempts to curtail the use of drugs, but all 
government efforts have been cosmetic and were initiated as 
political ploys for attracting votes just before elections were 
due to be held. The most ludicrous and useless of these 
anti-drug campaigns was launched by the former U.S. first lady, 
Nancy Reagan, who coined the phrase "Just say no" in the naive 
belief that school children will be able to overcome peer 
pressure just by uttering a few meaningless words. 
  Illegal drug cultivation will continue so long as the United 
States and Europe provide such lucrative markets for its 
distribution, and the successful distribution of contraband 
drugs are only possible through the collusion and cooperation of 
the governments of drug consuming nations with drug 
distributors. Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe 
the sincerity and conviction of U.S. and other governments of 
drug consuming nations regarding their antidrug projects. 
  The annual revenue generated by the illegal drug trade in 
the 
West amounts to tens of billions of dollars and it seems 
implausible that the U.S. and other drug-using nations will 
allow this trade to continue without getting a share of its 
income. Also, the social fabric of these societies are 
conducive to the propagation of the drug culture. 
  The United States with its enormous wealth and its 
specialized anti-drug task forces is unable to stem the flow of 
drugs into its territories, and has repeatedly stated that it 
cannot control its borders effectively. If this statement is to 
be believed, then how can the same country expect others who 
lack its sophisticated technology and monetary resources to 
succeed in this campaign without financial and material help 
from world organizations charged with eradicating this 
dehumanizing trade. 
  It seems that the U.S. is, as usual, using any old excuse to 
single out the countries that are opposed to its policies for 
chastisement. On the one hand the United States insists that 
drugs must be eradicated and drug distributors must be punished. 
But on the other hand, through several international 
organizations which it finances, the U.S. condemns countries 
such as the Islamic Republic for executing convicted drug lords 
in accordance with the law of the land. 
  Before the United States passes judgment on other nations 
and 
societies, it will do well to take a look at its own society and 
start to implement social changes that will help its people find 
contentment and satisfaction in the everyday activities of the 
nucleus family rather than by using drugs.

  [Text] The Syrian Foreign Ministry has stated the following: 
  For many years, the Syrian authorities, in cooperation with 
the Lebanese authorities, have been exerting themselves to 
combat the growing of poppies and other narcotics, especially in 
the al-Biqa' region, long known for producing such crops. 
  We can state, on the strength of the information available 
to 
us, that these efforts have succeeded in putting an end to the 
cultivation of these illegal plants, despite the extreme 
difficulties involved in combating them, curbing their 
processing, and banning trade in them. 
  Syria is known to have passed strict anti-drug legislation 
and taken severe disciplinary measures against drug growers, 
manufacturers, smugglers, and traffickers. Syria ranks among 
the countries with the cleanest record in this area. 
Furthermore, the values and traditions of the Syrian Arab 
society in themselves constitute a natural immunity against this 
blight. 
  Syria's efforts in the area of fighting drugs have earned 
the 
satisfaction of the United Nations and the regional committee 
for the fight against drugs, which chose Damascus as the venue 
for its 30th congress in February, 1994. The committee's 
representative judged Syria's anti-drug drive to be commendable. 
  For all the above reasons, and despite the fact that the 
competent agency at the U.S. State Department recommended that 
Syria be removed from the list of nations charged with failing 
to combat drug abuse--to cite an article published in the 21 
March issue of the WASHINGTON POST--certain members of the U.S. 
Administration, many of whose stands have hindered rather than 
facilitated the peace process, have deliberately ignored these 
recommendations, and insisted on keeping Syria on the list, 
despite all the realities and facts that prove Syria's fight 
against drugs. 
  It is now clear beyond a shadow of doubt that the aim of 
placing Syria on the drug or terrorism list is to pressure Syria 
into relinquishing its stands and just causes, acknowledged by 
the international community and endorsed by UN resolutions, 
envisaging a just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Syria's stands and just causes cannot be bargained over. 
Syria's efforts and measures in the anti-drug campaign 
originate in a conviction in the need to wipe out the risks 
inherent in this scourge and its devastating impact on 
individuals and societies in this region and elsewhere. 
  Syria is not looking for a reward from anyone for its 
anti-drug and anti-terror efforts. Syria would not have issued 
this statement if it were not for the attempts of certain 
circles in the United States to misrepresent facts and falsify 
records to advance political pressure that will only shake the 
confidence of the region in the role of the United States as an 
honest broker in the peace process.

  [Text] Damascus, April 2 (AFP) -- The official press here 
on Saturday accused the "Zionist" lobby of helping to keep Syria 
on a US list of nations involved in the international drug trade 
and trying to sabotage better ties between Damascus and 
Washington. 
  Syria's Tishrin daily denounced "the refusal of US 
congressmen who are close to the Zionist lobby, and who do not 
really like the Syrian-US rapprochement, to remove Syria's name 
from the list." 
  Such behavior was "proof of hostile and aggressive 
intentions 
against Syria," which had taken the necessary steps to curb the 
transit of drugs across its territory, the paper said, adding 
that Syria was not a producer country. 
  Tishrin recalled that in April 1993 a law was adopted 
requiring the death penalty for those convicted of growing, 
producing and trafficking drugs. 
  A White House statement on Friday said that Syria had done 
little to combat drug trafficking. 
  The State Department had initially wanted to exempt Syria 
from the list to reward it for helping to press the Palestine 
Liberation Organization back into peace talks, The New York 
Times reported Friday. 
  But legislators denounced the State Department's 
maneuvering, 
given Syria's poor record in stopping the opium trade in the 
al-Biqa Valley in Lebanon, an area largely controlled by Syria, 
the Times said. 
  Mindful of the explosiveness of granting concessions to 
Syria, Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled 
lower-ranking officials who had recommended the exemption. 
  Syria is due to resume bilateral peace talks with Israel 
later this month.

  [Text] Categorically rejecting U.S. questioning over the 
extent of the antidrug struggle in Bolivia, the government 
yesterday reasserted the international principle of ``upholding 
the sovereignty and independence of nations'' by stating that 
Bolivia ``is not on its knees'' before the United States. 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Minister of Government 
German Quiroga reported that political and electoral reasons 
prevented the country from fulfilling its goals on the 
eradication of coca leaves in 1993, but they explained that 
``this is far from not having the intention to harshly combat 
drug trafficking.'' 
  Quiroga said: ``We have categorically not been brought to 
our knees over anything, and are adopting decisions with 
absolute sovereignty.'' 
  He stated that Bolivia is considered a country that still 
needs economic aid, ``but such an attitude is a warning against 
it.'' 
  Quiroga added that the government intends to continue to 
implement a harsh drug interdiction program, to reconcile 
criteria with coca producers so as to jointly take action 
against drug trafficking, and fundamentally, to exert control 
over precursors, so as to prevent them from entering the country. 
  For his part, Aranibar stated that the Clinton report ``was 
what was expected.'' He explained that for electoral reasons, 
the Bolivian Government was unable to fulfill its commitments 
``because the previous government did not want to assume a major 
commitment regarding coca eradication policy.'' 
  He said: ``President Sanchez de Lozada has clearly made a 
commitment to combat drug trafficking. This commitment does not 
only encompass the reduction of the area where coca is farmed, 
but other important goals.'' 
  After stating that the discussions and negotiations of an 
extradition treaty will necessarily encompass international 
juridical cooperation, Aranibar said: ``There is a commitment 
with the U.S. Government to negotiate an extradition treaty, and 
that is what we are doing. Any negotiation will obviously take 
into consideration the interests of the two parties.'' 
  Moreover, the EFE news agency reports from Washington that 
the U.S. Government has issued a not very optimistic report 
stating that the international community continues to lose the 
battle against drug trafficking. 
  Robert Gelbard, current assistant secretary of state for 
international narcotics matters and former U.S. ambassador to 
Bolivia, said during a news conference that those countries that 
do not cooperate in the international effort to combat drug 
trafficking will be subjected to more pressure in the future. 
  One of the ``important victories'' cited in the report is 
that well-known drug kingpin Carmelo ``Meco'' Dominguez was 
arrested in Bolivia, but it adds that corruption is an important 
problem in the country, and for the third consecutive year it 
criticizes the fact that Bolivia has failed in its objective to 
eradicate coca farms.

published in italics] 
  [Text] Thanks to its interdiction policies, Mexico has 
prevented 50 tons of cocaine annually from entering the U.S. 
market over the last five years. This places Mexico third in 
world drug trafficking control. However, this ``noticeable'' 
level of interdiction prompted the proliferation of ``drug 
pushers,'' especially along the northern border, who have 
triggered hard drug consumption where there was none before. 
  Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix, Human Rights and Drug 
Trafficking coordinator of the Foreign Relations Secretariat, 
pointed out that we are running the risk that drug trafficking 
money, which will eventually be ``laundered,'' could enter the 
Mexican financial system thanks to trade opening. 
  As for the U.S. State Department's International Drug 
Trafficking Control Report disclosed last week, the official 
said that the Mexican fight against drug trafficking is 
currently taking place without any pressure from the United 
States. He added: ``It is a more balanced struggle due to 
President William Clinton's efforts to fight local consumption, 
not foreign production.'' [quotation marks as published] As he 
emphasized that our country's fight against drugs is due to 
internal reasons, Gonzalez criticized the report, which 
indicated that 50 percent of the drugs coming into the United 
States enter through our territory. 
  He stressed that at the beginning of the current six-year 
presidential term, the detection and interception of cocaine 
failed to reach 10 tons; during the last few years, however, 
drug seizures amounted to about 50 tons annually. The report 
should state the opposite: ``Thanks to the efforts of Mexico, 
the amount of cocaine that enters the United States has been 
curtailed by one fifth. Should we look at it from this 
viewpoint, it would be exactly the opposite.'' [sentence as 
published] 
  We increased drug seizures from 10 to 50 tons. Should we 
take into account that drug interdiction amounts to 100 tons at 
the U.S. border, 60 tons in Colombia, and 50 tons in Mexico, and 
that Spain, among the European nations, intercepts the most 
cocaine, 10 tons, then the detection level will indeed be ``very 
noticeable.'' 
  Gonzalez admitted that one of the big problems with the 
interdiction policies is the proliferation of ``drug pushers.'' 
Although there is no widespread and serious drug consumption at 
the border, it is a problem that worries authorities 
nonetheless, because it is a situation ``we never thought we 
would have to deal with.'' 
  The diplomat [title as published] added that another problem 
that Mexico could face in view of the free trade is money 
/laundering/, which could emerge at the same time as the market 
opens. This is an issue that the Finance Secretariat and the 
Attorney General's Office have already began to work on. The 
interdiction systems were more vulnerable to drug trafficking 
money prior to the opening, but these mechanisms are currently 
being strengthened to ensure that ``ill-conceived money'' 
operations could be foreseen, detected, and controlled. 
  Gonzalez said that this is a vanguard issue on the American 
continent; Europe and Asia do not have to deal with this problem 
despite their open markets. He insisted Mexico is at the 
vanguard. 
  The so-called U.S. report on our country on the drug issue 
is 
secondary for the official. What is really important is the 
Clinton administration's shift to concentrating more on local 
consumption aspects, not on the cooperation systems of other 
nations. It is not that we want to praise his job, but we could 
say that the most praiseworthy part of it is the change Clinton 
made with regard to local drug consumption. ``They are 
channeling more resources to their consumption problem; they are 
also realizing that although the strategies that they 
implemented in the past indeed diminish drug inflows to the 
country, said strategies generated a number of unexpected 
conflicts.'' 
  This does not mean that the United States will drop 
international cooperation programs altogether. The official 
maintained that cooperation systems with Latin America and 
Mexico still prevail, but they are now very respectful of the 
nations' sovereignty. 
  The United States is tackling these problems, as Mexico has 
done for many years, from an integral viewpoint that will combat 
not only production and trafficking, but also consumption. 
  Does this mean the United States is exerting less pressure 
on 
us? 
  The situation changed when President Clinton came to power. 
It is very respectful of sovereignty, and this makes us have 
fewer conflicts and more expeditious cooperation.

  [Text] Local diplomatic sources have reported that 
President Guillermo Endara is currently examining the draft of a 
protest note that his government will officially present to the 
U.S. Government in light of a U.S. report that Panama is an 
international money laundering center. 
  Jaime Ford, the Panamanian ambassador in Washington, D.C., 
met yesterday with Foreign Minister Jose Mulino to draft the 
protest document. Government sources told LA PRENSA that the 
president is carefully analyzing the draft note before signing 
it. 
  Officials from the Clinton administration recently affirmed 
that Panama has become a major drug money laundering center. 
Endara and Foreign Minister Mulino later rejected the 
accusation. 
  Jaime Ford stated that there has been no major reaction from 
the United States since the report was released. The ambassador 
explained that ``we are working very hard to draft this protest 
note. That is the reason for my visit to the Foreign Ministry.'' 
  Last week Endara said that Panama is helping in the fight 
against drug trafficking and money laundering. 
  Ford added that the Foreign Ministry and the presidency are 
drafting the protest note together and ``will deliver it as soon 
as it is ready.'' 
  The diplomat also said that the world, as it faces the 
invasion of drugs, must create an organization that can combine 
efforts, with proper respect for the sovereignty of each nation, 
to fight drug trafficking and its effects. 
  U.S. Government sources have also said that there is more 
money being laundered in Panama now than during the days of drug 
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
  The Endara administration has rejected the charges, arguing 
that this is a campaign to tarnish the country's image.

  [Text] The Panamanian Government has issued a formal 
protest to the U.S. Government over recent statements that 
Panama is not cooperating enough in the struggle against drug 
trafficking and money laundering. 
  Jose Raul Mulino sent a four-page letter noting that the 
U.S. 
statements are general and subjective. He added that the 
Panamanian Government has taken many actions to fight those 
crimes. 
  In the document, Mulino says that Panama is not an economic 
power and on many occasions it has had to establish it 
priorities. Regarding the struggle against drug trafficking, our 
cooperation has been expeditious and in good faith. 
  Mulino asked for a meeting at the highest level, with the 
participation of the private sector linked to the financial 
center, to discuss this problem. 
  The letter clearly states that the national government has 
not eluded its responsibility.

<F P=106> [From the ``Telemetro Reports'' newscast] </F>
  [Text] National Bank of Panama General Manager Luis Horacio 
Moreno said that the money-laundering charges made by the United 
States against Panama are unfair and that the biggest money 
launderers are in the United States. Luis H. Moreno refuses to 
accept the conclusions of a U.S. report, which states that the 
Panamanian Government has implemented several measures to reduce 
the risks involved in misusing the Panamanian banking center. 
  [Begin Moreno recording] Bankers in the National 
Banking Association, among whom I count myself as a 
representative of the National Bank of Panama, have done and 
continue to do everything possible to reduce the incidence and 
risk of misuse of our services in the form of money laundering. 
We have not done it because the United States asked us to or 
because we want to qualify for a loan, but because we are 
convinced that attacking and fighting money laundering is a 
patriotic duty. In so doing, we are also fighting drug 
trafficking, one of the worst plagues of our time, which 
jeopardizes our young people and our entire community. That is 
the real reason; it is not to qualify as one of the good little 
boys. 
  All we want is to fulfill our patriotic duty. This 
government has carried out innumerable actions and made great 
effort that have been unacknowledged until now. Beginning in 
March 1990 we took effective steps to control cash deposits at 
banks. Since then and for the last four years, Panama has 
implemented an incredible number of controls such as that last 
measure you just mentioned: declaring the amount of cash one is 
bringing into the country when going through customs, which is 
something many other countries do. We will continue to do so, 
because this is not something that will go away with two, three, 
or even 100 measures. The United States, which is the 
qualifying party, launders the most money in the world. The 
United States invests tens of billions of dollars each year and 
they have still been unable to do solve the problem. [end

  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A ranking police official 
on Friday [15 April] denied the US accusation that Taiwan has 
become a drug transit center. 
  Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police 
Administration, said that from 1990 through 1993, police here 
seized a total of 1,092 kilograms of heroin and 3,566 kilograms 
of amphetamines worth a combined street value of billions of 
U.S. dollars. ``Without the police crackdown, those drugs would 
have been circulated either in Taiwan or re-exported to other 
countries,'' he said. 
  The U.S. State Department submitted the 1993 [as received] 
International Narcotics Control Strategy Report to Congress 
earlier in the month, accusing Taiwan of allowing the production 
of illicit amphetamines and of increasingly playing a role in 
the laundering of drug money. 
  According to the report, Taiwan has become an important 
Southeast Asian transit center for heroin. It said movement of 
the drugs is difficult to detect because of Taiwan's heavy 
merchant marine traffic. 
  Wang Chun, director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, 
admitted that more efforts need to be taken in the fight against 
drug smuggling and more money budgeted for the purpose. Only 
NT$2.8 million [new Taiwan dollars] (US$106,060) is used by 
Taiwan police to combat drug trafficking each year, as compared 
with US$12 billion appropriated by the United States. 
  He also said Taiwan needs to change the law that treats drug 
addicts as criminals rather than as patients so that they can 
get help to kick their habits. 
  Local police seized an average of three or four kilograms of 
drugs each year before 1989. But the figure rose to 154 
kilograms in 1991 and a stunning 810 kilograms in 1993. 
  Police in the central Taiwan County of Chiayi in a raid on 
May 11 [date as received] seized 336 kilograms of high-grade 
heroin, prompting Premier Lien Chan to announce a nationwide 
campaign against drug smuggling.

  [Excerpts] The Federal Government has rejected the recent 
categorization of Nigeria by the United States of America as one 
of the four countries not cooperating with it in the fight 
against drug trafficking. The head of state, General Sani 
Abacha, stated Nigeria's objection to the classification today 
in Abuja during his maiden press briefing of media executives. 
State House correspondent Chris Nguw reports that Gen. Abacha 
described the briefing as an opportunity for forging a 
productive government-media partnership: 
  [Begin recording] Nguw: The head of 
state's briefing centered on six issues: Government-press 
relationship, the economic policy, foreign policy, the imminent 
constitutional conference, drug trafficking, and the 
Nigerian-Cameroon dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula. One of 
the highlights of the briefing was his reference to the United 
States' recent listing of Nigeria as an uncooperative country in 
the fight against drug trafficking as a political smoke screen, 
without doubt a genuine component of the United States policy on 
drug control. Gen. Abacha said the United States' pronouncement 
was a surprise, especially as Nigeria's efforts at combating 
drug trafficking are well known and have been recently applauded 
by the American Embassy in Nigeria and the United States drug 
administration. He said his administration would, however, not 
be deterred in the fight against drug trafficking. 
  Abacha: Be that as it may, it should be understood 
by all concerned that this administration is going to continue 
its fight against drug trafficking and the related crimes just 
from our concern to ensure that the drug taking culture does not 
take firm roots in our society. We shall intensify our antidrug 
crusade. Of course, we believe it is right to do so in our 
national interest and to protect our society from its cancerous 
effects that we have observed in Western societies. We urge the 
Western governments to look inwards into their own societies and 
curb the excessive appetite of their own citizens, which creates 
the demand for drugs. [applause] Nigeria does not produce any 
hard drugs. Nigerians are not a drug consuming people. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Vienna, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China will support as 
ever international efforts in drug control, said a Chinese 
delegate at the 37th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs opened here today. 
  ``The Chinese government will...devote serious attention to 
and intensify international cooperation in the field of 
narcotics control...and take an active part in every specified 
activity in the domain of international drug control and will 
make its own contribution in this regard,'' said Chen Shiqiu, 
head of the Chinese delegation. 
  In particular, China will ``spare no effort to support the 
Golden Triangle sub-regional drug control cooperative activities 
and projects,'' he added. 
  Chen, who is also the Chinese representative in the 
Vienna-based UN and other international institutions, reported 
to the meeting on China's anti-drug achievements. 
  China has been placing special emphasis on the interdiction 
effort against transit drug smuggling in its southwestern border 
areas through comprehensive measures to strictly prohibit drug 
trafficking, cultivation and abuse, and intensified drug law 
enforcement, he noted. 
  In 1993, the Chinese drug law enforcement agencies handled 
26,191 cases, apprehended 40,834 suspects and seized 3,354 
kilograms of opium, 4,459 kilograms of heroin and 90 metric tons 
of essential chemicals and precursors destined for the Golden 
Triangle area for drug processing. 
  In addition, China had last year 50,000 persons/times [as

<F P=106> [Article by Sven Wikstrom: ``Finnish Central Criminal Police </F>
Department and St. Petersburg Militia Trying To Solve Narcotics 
and Personal Safety Problems''] 
  [Text] Joutseno: The Central Criminal Police and the 
Militia of the St. Petersburg district made plans for closer 
cooperation on fighting drugs. Thirty-five police leaders and 
street level investigators have come together for a three day 
meeting in Joutseno to plan a joint effort to combat drugs and 
develop cooperation. This first meeting will end Friday [11 
March]. 
  Office chief Antti Turkama of the Central Criminal Police is 
promising more meetings and contacts in the future. ``An 
agreement in principle has already been made about a personnel 
exchange program. This will lead to narcotics investigators and 
lab personnel going for visits to familiarize themselves with 
the other agency's methods of investigation, equipment, and new 
narcotics.'' 
  According to Nikolai Gorbachevsky, the commander of the 
Criminal Department of the St. Petersburg Militia, meetings 
between experts on other branches of criminal activity are also 
to be expected. The next ones will be between those specializing 
in violent crime. Officials are concerned about the increase in 
crimes of violence, against businessmen in particular, in Russia. 
  The cooperation between these officials is made possible by 
a 
treaty between the two countries. According to the St. 
Petersburg Militia Criminal Department commander the federation 
government and the ministry currently encourage cooperation. In 
bygone times they prevented it. 
  In Gorbachevsky's opinion St. Petersburg has not yet become 
a 
center for the international drug trade. ``We are heading toward 
that distinction. There are increasing numbers of drug users and 
the choice of available drugs is getting greater,'' says 
Gorbachevsky. The international drug mafia has also shown an 
interest in St. Petersburg, at the very least as a 
transportation link. 
  The commander of the Narcotics Department of the St. 
Petersburg Militia, Anatoli Goncharenko, considers the area to 
be primarily a drug consumer concentration. Inexpensive drugs, 
derived from natural plants, are supplied from other parts of 
Russia. Synthetic drugs manufactured in laboratories, 
amphetamines, among others, make for a special problem in St. 
Petersburg. According to Goncharenko there are many unemployed 
or underemployed, highly educated chemists in St. Petersburg, 
who can supplement family incomes with drugs they can 
manufacture at their jobs. 
  In addition to a 1000-kg cocaine shipment, the narcotics 
militia in St. Petersburg confiscated 1000 kg of other drugs. 
The major portion of these, however, are inexpensive 
plant-based drugs.

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Federal Judge Nerio Bonifatti has 
formally acquitted former presidential audiences director and 
the President's sister-in-law Amira Yoma in the notorious 
``Yomagate'' scandal. 
  Amira Yoma has been summoned to appear in court this 
afternoon to receive the official notification that she has been 
definitely cleared. 
  President Menem yesterday [13 April] said that he regretted 
the way his sister-in-law had been treated since she was first 
accused of being part of the drug money-laundering scheme. Menem 
also accused the press of blowing up the statements of 
drug-dealer Andy de la Cruz Iglesias. 
  Bonifatti, who has been tipped for promotion to the Federal 
Appeals Court, is thought to have quashed the case on the basis 
of insufficient evidence. 
  Last week Federal Prosecutor Carlos Stornelli had 
recommended 
the acquittal of Yoma and other co-defendants. Stornelli is 
reportedly in line to succeed Bonifatti when he steps up to the 
Federal Court. 
  In 1991 Amira Yoma along with her then husband Ibrahim 
al-Ibrahim were accused by various witnesses of having been seen 
at Ezeiza International Airport with suitcases allegedly full of 
drug earnings from the United States. 
  The money passed through Customs without difficulty due to 
Amira's position as Presidential Audiences Secretary at 
Government House and her husband's senior Customs position, even 
though he hardly spoke Spanish and held a Syrian passport.

  [Excerpts] Our colleague Amalia Pando has prepared an 
exhaustive report on former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
statements to Congress. He appeared before Congress as a 
witness rather than defendant in a case investigating possible 
links between the MIR [Leftist Revolutionary Movement] and drug 
trafficking. This is what the Constituent Commission must 
determine, and this is why the former president of the Republic 
was summoned to testify. 
  The following is Amalia Pando's report: 
  [Begin recording] Pando: The 
information that former President Jaime Paz Zamora today gave 
the Constituent Commission confirms his close friendship with 
Isaac Chavarria, who has been arrested under charges of drug 
trafficking. Paz Zamora, however, repeatedly denied having been 
aware or even suspected that his friend was linked to drug 
trafficking. 
  Paz: As I have already stated, it started off as a 
political relationship. He wanted to work, from the political 
viewpoint, with the MIR and for the candidacy of Jaime Paz 
Zamora. But this relationship turned into a friendship in view 
of his moving background, which he himself disclosed, and the 
work and personal contacts he maintained. This is why if you 
were to ask me how many times I met with Isaac Chavarria, I 
would not be able to answer you. It is the same as if I were to 
ask you about any of your friends, and you started telling him 
how many times you saw him, where you saw him, how many times 
you met with him, etc. It should be pointed out that this 
friendship grew stronger, especially in 1987, and a little less 
in 1988. But we hardly saw each other in 1989, and almost never 
during my four years in the presidency of the Republic. This 
relationship, through me, spread to my family. Well, not all my 
family, but to my two sisters. I want to point out that this 
relationship never involved any type of crime. I also want to 
point out that Mr. Chavarria was always willing to work, to 
undertake projects. He always showed a great civic and 
patriotic spirit. I think he longed for his years in the Army. 
[passage omitted] 
  If my great friend Isaac Chavarria now has the misfortune of 
being involved in drug trafficking, I deeply regret it. But 
this fact by no means can stain the spotless relationship I 
maintained with him in the past. 
  Pando: When the so-called narco-photo [showing Paz 
Zamora together with Chavarria] was published, Chavarria was 
identified as a drug trafficker, but not even on that occasion 
did Paz Zamora suspect anything. He said that the reason was 
that on that occasion Chavarria disclosed his address, but that 
the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] did not visit him. 
  He also referred to the position of his social defense 
secretary at that time, Alderete. 
  Paz: The interesting thing is that on 11 June, I 
think, the media carried Alderete's answer to Deputy Gonzalez 
Quintanilla. As a result of the anonymous photograph attached 
to a letter sent to Congress, Alderete, the social defense 
secretary under Paz Estenssoro's government, promised 
Quintanilla, Congress, and the Bolivian people that in a week's 
time he would have a list of Isaac Chavarria's crimes, which he 
would send to all FELCN offices throughout the country. The 
country is still waiting for this information, which he had said 
would be ready in one week's time. 
  Pando: MIR Deputy Luis Vasquez asked Paz Zamora 
whether the MIR leaders had ever warned him about the risks his 
friendship with Chavarria entailed. 
  Paz: I want to reiterate what I have already said. 
I never suspected that Isaac Chavarria was involved in any 
crime. What fellow partisan Susana Seleme [Paz Zamora's private 
secretary] disclosed here before Congress does not belong to a 
specific meeting in Santa Cruz. I was never told: Fellow 
partisan Jaime Paz, come, sit down, we want to talk to you about 
this problem. What I did notice was that some [MIR] members did 
not like him. That is a fact. But MIR leader Guillermo 
Capobianco and other high-ranking members, for example, didn't 
have this problem. 
  Pando: In 1990 Chavarria's home in La Paz was 
raided. Jaime Paz Zamora heard about this, and ordered his 
private secretary to find out about it at the FELCN. 
  Paz: It was not a precise order. What I did do 
was to ask her to find out what had happened because, as I have 
already stated, the private secretary never gave instructions; 
in this case, she only asked for information on what had 
happened to determine whether there was anything illegal about 
the charges. That is what happened. Susana Seleme, as [name 
indistinct] mentioned and also reminded me, informed me that she 
had phoned (General Anez) who told her it was a routine 
operation among the hundreds and hundreds of routine operations 
the FELCN carries out. I think they call them warning 
operations. And that was the end of that. After receiving that 
information I forgot the issue but now, after years, I realize 
through some documents mentioned here in Congress that the 
operation was not directed against Isaac Chavarria. 
  Unidentified legislator: Didn't this information 
about the FELCN operation against Chavarria's home, linked to a 
recent event, raise any suspicions? We are talking about 
something that happened in the year 1989 or 1990, when you said 
that the charges that Chavarria was involved in drug trafficking 
were outrageous. Didn't the information on the FELCN operation 
against Chavarria's home cause you to suspect anything? 
  Paz: The truth is that I accepted the explanation 
I was given, because in my capacity as president I had a 
thousand and one other things to think about, and forgot the 
issue. As I have already stated, my contacts with Chavarria had 
become very sporadic. At that time it had been almost a year 
since I had last seen him. 
  Pando: After Chavarria's home in Irpavi was raided 
by the FELCN, Paz Zamora met with Chavarria at Edith Paz 
Zamora's home. He was asked whether on that occasion Chavarria 
ever mentioned the FELCN raid on his home in Irpavi. 
  Paz: I do not remember. I am afraid I do not 
remember. Aside from our talks on the railroad ties--because he 
explained the problem, and I told him I would learn more about 
it before I decided what should be done--the meeting lasted 
longer than ever because we discussed politics. Chavarria is 
very interested in politics. 
  Pando: Paz Zamora definitely did not find out 
before, during, or after his government that Chavarria was a 
drug trafficker. He also said that neither social defense under 
secretary (Gonzalo Torricos) nor the FELCN had warned him that 
Chavarria was involved in illegal activities. At this point 
Deputy Juan del Granado read 13 press reports from PRESENCIA, 
HOY, and other newspapers published in 1991, accusing Chavarria 
of drug trafficking. 
  Del Granado: ...PRESENCIA reports that Isaac 
Chavarria, I mean Isaac Etcheverria, heads a list of the nine 
most sought after drug traffickers by Bolivian courts and 
anti-drug agents the United States had stationed in Bolivia. 
Didn't you read this information? 
  Paz: No. I didn't. Well, there was another drug 
trafficker called Etcheverria who I believe was taken to the 
United States, but I think it was before then. I think he was 
the one who produced the evidence against [name indistinct]. 
But, well, in any case it does not refer to that Etcheverria. 
I did not learn about this, but what I wonder is, if it is 
true, why I was not informed directly? The FELCN is 
semi-autonomous. Why was there so much noise and no action? 
Alderete announced something in 1988, but never did anything 
about it. I think that worse than the fact that I did not read 
that press report, is that if the information was true nothing 
was done about it. 
  Pando: But there were 13, and not only one, press 
reports published around the same time mentioning Isaac 
Etcheverria and Isaac Chavarria as two of the most important 
Bolivian drug traffickers. Why didn't the FELCN arrest 
Chavarria during Paz Zamora's government? Paz Zamora himself 
asked this question which, some way or another, the Constituent 
Commission must answer. The second important aspect of Paz 
Zamora's statements to the commission were his charges, 
sometimes in a direct and others in an indirect manner, against 
the U.S. Embassy and the FELCN of having orchestrated this plot 
to destroy the MIR, his family, and him. [passage omitted] 
  Paz: I want to fully reiterate what I said in my 
message to the Bolivian people on 26 March. I reiterate my 
intention to withdraw from politics. I have realized there is a 
plan, through me, to damage the country, its image. There is a 
plan to harm the Republic, to harm values for which all 
Bolivians have worked hard, such as the values of democracy, 
national coexistence, national unity. I have also realized that 
there is not only a plan to harm our country, through me, but 
also my party. 
  Pando: On this occasion Paz Zamora tried to change 
from playing defendant to plaintiff, and for this he railed 
against the FELCN, which is not very popular and on many 
occasions has been repudiated by the people. We will have to 
await the Constituent Commission's final report to know whether 
Jaime Paz' charges against dubious FELCN procedures will clear 
all that has been said about the connection he, his family, and 
the MIR reportedly maintained with drug trafficker Isaac 
Chavarria. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Here are the highlights of former President 
Jaime Paz Zamora's six-hour testimony before the Constituent 
Commission; 
  [Begin Recording] Amalia Pando: In his 
testimony before the Constituent Commission, former President 
Jaime Paz Zamora declared he was both a victim of his own 
mistakes as well as those of the Special Antinarcotics Force 
[FELCN] and the Prosecutor's office. 
  He referred to an alleged U.S. plot designed to get back at 
him because his government defended coca farming at an 
international level and because he invited Fidel Castro to visit 
Bolivia. 
  Paz: I hope the commission agrees with me when I 
say that we run the risk that our ineffective struggle against 
drug trafficking may be used within our country for political or 
other purposes. [passage omitted] 
  Do you not think, when I saw the regrettable way in which 
the 
FELCN and the Prosecutor General acted, I did not wonder how 
they acted in previous cases and how many people may have been 
victims of this irresponsible, corrupt, and superficial 
management of our prisons throughout the country? 
  Pando: During his administration, Paz Zamora was 
asked to safeguard our sovereignty in light of the obvious 
intervention by the U.S. Embassy. At that time Paz Zamora 
talked about a sham [pacotilla] sovereignty. 
  Paz: We must not let the FELCN, in the name of the 
noble struggle against drug trafficking, become a nightmare for 
the citizenry as was the case of the Tonton Macoutes in Haiti. 
  Pando: The former president then made a series of 
charges which had been reported by the media throughout the four 
years of his administration. 
  Paz: Higher ranking FELCN officers, district 
prosecutors, and the special prosecutors for drug cases receive 
their salaries directly from the financial cooperation granted 
by the United States. This is not normal. I would say this is 
a typical case of cooperation--which we need--but which could 
turn into intervention. After all, you obey the one who pays 
you your salary. 
  Pando: He ended his attacks against the FELCN and 
the prosecutors in a categorical manner. 
  Paz: Nothing of what was said was true. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Announcer Carlos Mesa: At approximately 
1930 on 11 April, I received a phone call from Edgar Fernandez 
Lazcano. Katia Rodriguez now will inform us about this phone 
call. 
  [Begin recording] Katia Rodriguez: 
Edgar Fernandez said he met DEA agents in Bogota, Colombia, but 
that he managed to dodge the U.S. agents in Costa Rica. This is 
the report: 
  Reporter Amalia Pando: [identified by screen 
caption] Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, who worked for Isaac 
Chavarria, phoned the PAT [Television Journalists Association] 
to tell us he is not in the DEA's hands. But when Carlos Mesa 
asked him where he was, he said he would rather remain 
underground. When he was asked how he paid for his trips and 
these costly phone calls, he broke down in tears. 
  Fernandez: I am so desperate that I am begging for 
justice in my country and the support of my university mates, 
the media, and all those who believe I am not lying. 
  Pando: We have confirmed that the person who 
phoned was in fact Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, Chavarria's 
employee. Let us hear this person's voice in the recording 
heard by the Constituent Commission: 
  Fernandez: Help me don Oscar; I have no money. 
You cannot screw me after all I have witnessed, such as when 
you received 40,000..... 
  Pando: Now let us hear the voice of the person who 
phoned PAT: 
  Fernandez: My name is Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, 
identity card and passport No. 3365571, both issued in La Paz. 
  Pando: There is no doubt that the voice belongs to 
the same person. Moreover, he correctly answered personal 
questions such as when he obtained his identity card or what 
address he gave at the immigration office when he applied for a 
passport. Therefore, we are certain that the person who phoned 
PAT was, in fact, Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. 
  We told him we wanted to know how he left Bolivia and 
entered 
Costa Rica because there is evidence that Fernandez Lazcano was 
abducted by the DEA. 
  Fernandez: I will tell you how I left Bolivia when 
I am given guarantees to return to Bolivia. I will tell you 
what towns I went through, what means of transportation I used, 
all of it public transportation. I was never in contact with 
the DEA. The first time I got in contact with the DEA was when 
I arrived in Bogota. 
  Pando: As you see, all the details of how he left 
Bolivia are uncertain. He told us later he ended up in Bogota, 
Colombia, but to enter Colombia you need an entry visa, which 
can be requested at any consulate. PAT confirmed that Fernandez 
Lazcano had not acquired that visa. He never appeared at the 
Colombian consulate in La Paz, Lima, nor in Quito. How then did 
he enter Colombia without a visa. One thing Fernandez Lazcano 
does admit is that the DEA took him to Costa Rica. 
  Fernandez: When we arrived in Bogota, I talked to 
DEA agents. I concretely told them: The only thing I demand is 
that you help me reach the United States, and once I am there I 
will disclose everything. I admit having gone to Bogota. 
Initially they told me we would go to Panama and I said, well, 
that I would speak in Panama. At first they said: No. Speak 
now; tell us all you know now; tell us what they say. I 
answered: No, I am not going to speak here; I am going to do so 
in another country. At my insistence--because I said the United 
States or nothing--they first said we would go to Panama because 
the plane was too small to fly from Bogota to the United States. 
So, first we will go to Panama. When we were about to land in 
Panama, because I thought we were heading for Panama--I do not 
know why because the people who picked me up spoke English and 
understood, two of them especially, very little Spanish, I 
wondered whether we were in Panama but it turned out we were in 
Costa Rica. 
  Pando: Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's version sounds 
even more incredible when he says that he managed to dodge the 
DEA in Costa Rica. 
  Fernandez: As you said, in Costa Rica I dodged the 
DEA, because I was surprised only three people interviewed me 
given the importance of the U.S. Embassy. I decided to follow 
my plan. I was arrested in Costa Rica because I decided to wait 
a few days and not go to Nicaragua as I planned in the belief 
that the DEA would be after me in Costa Rica. 
  Pando: According to Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, after 
getting away from the DEA he was detained, by chance, for 27 
hours by Costa Rican police. After he was released, a Bolivian 
prosecutor arrived to interrogate him. 
  Mesa: Didn't you try to get in contact with the 
DEA or did the DEA seek you after you were released in Costa 
Rica, and were you able to move freely and leave Costa Rica 
without any problems? 
  Fernandez: This is what surprised me and made me 
really happy because when I was arrested the first thing I 
thought was: The Bolivian DEA [as heard] is quite capable of 
sending a fax or something and messing up my life because I have 
dodged them. But I got very happy when I realized they were not 
aware... 
  Pando: Despite what Isaac Chavarria's employee 
asserts, the Costa Rican Government has its own version. It 
said Fernandez Lazcano left Costa Rica in a DEA aircraft to 
Miami. It is quite likely that Edgar Fernandez Lazcano may have 
made fun of the DEA but it is quite unlikely he will make fun of 
all of us. 
  Fernandez: Regarding my job with Isaac Chavarria, 
I was a close aide of his. I do not know what he considered me, 
probably his dog's keeper, an employee with no rank; I do not 
know. But, unfortunately, during the several years I worked for 
him I learned about a lot of things. 
  Pando: Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's conversation with 
Carlos Mesa lasted 45 minutes. During it he ratified all he 
told the Bolivian prosecutor in Costa Rica and a lot more. 
Among the new things he said was that Jaime Paz Zamora's 
government had offered Isaac Chavarria the possibility of 
benefiting from the repentance law. 
  Fernandez: Before the 120-day deadline the 
government granted the drug traffickers to surrender, Susana 
Seleme went--I do not have concrete evidence about this but I 
was told that the captain was upset by the two visits Susana 
Seleme paid him on weekends to suggest that he surrender, that 
he benefit from the repentance law. 
  Mesa: Who told you that? 
  Fernandez: The captain's wife told me that. You 
can ask her. I am sure she will not lie; I know she is aware of 
my true situation. 
  Pando: So far we have all heard that Chavarria 
gave Paz Zamora money, but according to this new version Jaime 
Paz Zamora gave Chavarria $40,000. 
  Fernandez: I maintain that Edith [Paz Zamora's 
sister] went to Santa Cruz, to Los Troncos town, where she met 
Chavarria. She asked Chavarria to help her find some good land 
to buy for Jaime Paz's sons. Taking advantage of this occasion, 
Edith said: Oso [Chavarria's nickname], Jaime has sent you this 
$40,000. 
  Mesa: In other words, Jaime Paz gave Chavarria 
$40,000. 
  Fernandez: That is precisely what happened. 
  Pando: To that end, Fernandez Lazcano said he 
wants to return to Bolivia to speak, to disclose all he knows, 
but said he fears he will be arrested. He refused to say where 
he is now. Anyway, we all know he is in Miami, to be more 
precise, in the DEA offices. And we say this based on the report 
issued by the Costa Rican Government to the media. [end

  [Text] La Paz -- As the ``narco-links'' case [involving 
alleged links between former President Jaime Paz Zamora and his 
party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, with drug 
trafficking] gains impetus, fear grows within government and 
political circles that the U.S. Court may issue a ``massive 
request for extradition of Bolivian citizens who perpetrated 
attacks and/or crimes within U.S. territory, according to 
official sources.'' 
  According to Interior Under Secretary Hugo San Martin, 
``there is an extradition procedure that has probably been 
considered for the `Rico Toro case' and will probably be used 
for other people.'' 
  Some legislators fear that as a result of the developments 
following the charges and statements by drug trafficker Carmelo 
Dominguez Vaca and the report on the FELCN [Special 
Antinarcotics Force] operations, the United States may request 
the extradition of ``many Bolivian citizens involved in drug 
trafficking such as General Felipe Carvajal Badani, retired, the 
former National Police chief.'' 
  Referring to the former police chief, the FELCN report 
states: ``In October 1989 (Jaime) Paz Zamora swore in Felipe 
Carvajal as the National Police commander. Carvajal, a MIR 
activist well known for being corrupt, has a strong relationship 
with [former Interior Minister Guillermo] Capobianco. Carvajal 
resigned on 12 March 1991 charging that the U.S. Embassy was 
pressuring him.'' 
  When Hugo San Martin was asked on Thursday, 31 March, if he 
knew of an alleged U.S. request to the Bolivian Foreign Ministry 
for the extradition of Gen. Felipe Carvajal he answered: ``We 
have nothing official.'' 
  Diplomatic sources explained that despite the lack of an 
extradition treaty between Bolivia and the United States that 
explicitly refers to trafficking, the latter ``has every right 
to seek the extradition of any Bolivian citizens it believes are 
involved in trafficking in U.S. territory.'' 
  As an example they mentioned that in the past few years the 
number of U.S. requests for extradition for this reason amounted 
to about two dozen. Of these requests, however, the Supreme 
Court only approved the ``case of Chunty Roca Suarez,'' who was 
sentenced by the civil court to 15 years imprisonment. 
  On 23 March the U.S. Embassy officially asked the Bolivian 
Foreign Ministry to extradite former Army Colonel Faustino Rico 
Toro for violating the Miami federal antinarcotics law. 
  The Foreign Ministry submitted the request for extradition 
to 
the Supreme Court of Justice which, in turn, submitted it to the 
Attorney General's office. Attorney General Angel Baldivieso 
has ordered Rico Toro's preventive imprisonment while legal 
procedures are completed. 
  Meanwhile, Government Minister German Quiroga Gomez 
disclosed 
that Faustino Rico Toro, who is believed to have shipped cocaine 
from Bolivia to the United States, will continue incommunicado 
in the FELCN prison in La Paz.

  [Text] La Paz, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Most of the Bolivian 
citizens who listened to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
voluntary testimony felt discouragement and uncertainty because 
he did not dissipate doubts regarding alleged links between 
politics and drug trafficking. 
  The public interpellation session of former President Paz 
Zamora by the Chamber of Deputies Constitution Committee 
maintained a very high audience during the six hours it lasted, 
comparable only to the rating obtained by broadcasts of the 
soccer matches played by the Bolivian team to qualify for the 
1994 Soccer World Cup. 
  Paz Zamora left a feeling of uncertainty among citizens when 
he emphatically denied any link by his family, party, or himself 
to drug trafficking, and at the same time admitted his personal 
friendship with drug trafficker Isaac ``Oso'' Chavarria. 
  The people's discouragement became worse when the high 
degree 
of dependency the country has on the United States was reflected 
in the statements made by former President Paz Zamora to 
Congress. His words ratified similar statements by current 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Last weekend Sanchez de Lozada revealed something the 
Bolivian people suspected but did not openly admit: ``We have a 
terrible dependency on the IMF, the U.S. Embassy, and the World 
Bank, who tell us what to do.'' 
  Paz Zamora warned that the U.S. cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking may turn into interference. He added 
that no one had informed him that his ``good friend Chavarria'' 
was an alleged drug trafficker and that he, as president, was 
informed about antinarcotics operations. 
  ``Everyone obeys who pays him,'' Paz Zamora said, adding 
that 
the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not only advised but 
paid as well by the U.S. DEA. 
  The former president's statements seemed to be aimed at 
rekindling the traditional anti-U.S. feelings of the Bolivian 
people. He also roused a feeling of solidarity with his cause 
when he stated that he had ``pinned the national banner on his 
chest'' to implement ``coca diplomacy,'' which hurt the feelings 
of the U.S. Government. 
  Paz Zamora and George Bush in 1990 signed a drug enforcement 
agreement that is still in force that regulates financial and 
technical cooperation, the DEA's advising of FELCN, and the 
substitution of coca crops. 
  Coca leaves, which are the raw material for cocaine, have 
become a point of friction between Bolivia and the United 
States. This Andean nation recognizes the need to eradicate 
cocaine but also faces a serious social and economic problem 
with the destruction of coca crops, which produce a living for 
about 300,000 peasants.

  [Text] It is quite likely that the U.S. request for the 
extradition of retired Colonel Faustino Rico Toro will be 
rejected, as has been the case with over 10 requests by the U.S. 
courts for the extradition of Bolivian citizens, due to the lack 
of an extradition agreement between Bolivia and the United 
States. 
  High-ranking judicial branch authorities, who asked not to 
be 
identified, made this comment in recalling that the extradition 
of Asunta Roca Suarez to the United States generated a negative 
reaction from the Bolivian public. 
  After this case the Supreme Court announced that it would 
not 
extradite any more Bolivian citizens to the United States unless 
a treaty in this regard was signed by the two countries. 
  One of the sources said: ``The United States would have to 
exert a lot of pressure to obtain Rico Toro's extradition, 
because the Supreme Court was quite clear on the issue.'' 
  All the U.S. requests for extradition refer to cases of drug 
trafficking and, in that sense, the sources stated that the 21 
April 1900 treaty signed by the two countries does not mention 
that type of crime. 
  Drug trafficking was a crime not known at that time, and 
this 
is the argument of the Bolivian Court to reject the U.S. 
requests for extradition. 
  Although the extradition of Asunta Roca [case not further 
specified] was based on the 1900 treaty, and was approved with 
the Vienna Convention signed in 1988 (a multilateral accord 
which includes drug trafficking as a crime for which a 
delinquent may be extradited), the sources explained that that 
document is contradictory.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The Rio de Janeiro district 
attorney will send the federal government files on the entrance 
of cocaine into Brazil through Paraguay in operations allegedly 
financed by the Rio de Janeiro illegal numbers lottery bankers. 
This is one of the main branches of the investigation that began 
after police busted into the fortress home of illegal lottery 
banker Castor de Andrade last week. Hundreds of names of 
individuals and organizations financed by the illegal lottery 
were found thanks to the investigation. 
  Illegal lottery banker Waldermiro Garcia, aka Miro, who is 
considered the richest of all the numbers lottery bankers, owns 
a casino in Ciudad del Este (Paraguayan city on the border with 
Foz de Iguazu). According to Paraguayan builders, nearly a year 
ago he invested $2 million just to refurbish his casino. 
  According to information obtained by Brazilian police that 
is 
in the District Attorney's Office's hands, 60 small, private 
airplanes fly daily from Paraguay into Brazil bringing drugs 
from Bolivia and Colombia. Most of the airplanes land in Sao 
Paulo State, from where the drugs are taken to Rio de Janeiro in 
small quantities. 
  The Rio de Janeiro district attorney will ask the government 
to carry out negotiations with the Paraguayan Government to 
further control the flights of small airplanes leaving for 
Brazil. The subject is being handled with total discretion 
because there are suspicions that Paraguayan Government 
officials may be involved in these operations. The 
investigations show that besides being used to bring cocaine, 
the airport [not further specified], which already has been 
closed once, also is used to receive smuggled weapons. 
<H5>  Reactions </H5>
  The day at the Rio de Janeiro District Attorney's Office was 
marked by reactions against the release of the list of names of 
people who received money from the illegal lottery scheme. 
  Rio District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia, who today 
wanted to concentrate on analyzing the thousands of pages from 
the accounting books where the financial movements of the 
illegal lottery bankers are registered, was forced to receive 
politicians and lawyers protesting the manner in which the case 
was made public. 
<H5>  Files </H5>
  After decoding 166 diskettes confiscated from the home of 
Castor de Andrade, the prosecutors and computer experts 
investigating the corruption scheme operated in Rio de Janeiro 
by the illegal lottery on 8 April managed to enter the files of 
the illegal lottery's top bankers, and they believe they will 
obtain extraordinary revelations. Nonetheless, they are waiting 
for authorization from District Attorney Biscaia to reveal their 
findings. 
  The diskettes found in the safes of Castor de Andrade's 
fortress home that police busted last week are being studied by 
experts from the District Attorney's Office and the Rio de 
Janeiro State Data Processing Center [Centro de Processamento de 
Dados--Proderj]. The work being carried out at the Military 
Police Classified Services Office, at the institution's 
headquarters, were surrounded by mystery on 8 April. 
  According to Classified Services Commander (P2) Colonel 
Marcos Paz, some of the diskettes' contents already have been 
printed by the experts. The printed pages were taken to the 
District Attorney's Office. The experts did not want to give out 
any information about their work, saying the information on the 
results is centered at the District Attorney's Office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``The Numbers Game Kingpins''] </F>
  [Text] Castor de Andrade--According to the district 
attorney he is the head of the gang. A law graduate, he was 
disbarred by the Brazilian Attorneys Association. He is the 
honorary president of the Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel 
samba school and a sponsor of the Bangu Atletico Clube soccer 
club. Before being sentenced last year by Judge Denise 
Frossard, he had been arrested by the Federal Police and by 
Interpol for making illegal profits, for being involved in video 
poker games, and for his participation in managing casinos. 
Regarding the numbers game, his area of influence is the West 
Zone, in the neighborhoods of Bangu, Marechal Hermes, Realengo, 
Senador Camara, and Mangaratiba, where he operates with his son 
Paulo Roberto de Andrade e Silva, who is also known as Paulinho 
da Mocidade. Andrade has been free thanks to a writ of habeas 
corpus granted by the Rio de Janeiro Superior Court. Paulinho 
remains under arrest at Interpol. 
  Anis Abraao David--He is better known as Anisio da 
Beija Flor. He patronizes the Beija Flor samba school. He 
controls the numbers game in Nilopolis and Nova Iguacu, in the 
Baixada Fluminense district. In 1978, he was charged with 
having ordered the murder of wall painter Misaque Jose Marques 
and of advertising expert Luis Carlos Jatoba. He was tried and 
acquitted. In 1991, his former wife Eliana Muller was murdered. 
The police found a letter written by Eliana in which she holds 
her former husband accountable for anything that should happen 
to her. Eliana also held Anisio responsible for the murder of 
Misque and Jatoba. Based on this evidence, District Attorney 
Antonio Carlos Biscaia has requested that the case be reopened. 
Anisio is being held in the Ferreira Vieira Neto prison in 
Niteroi, where he receives privileged treatment. 
  Ailton Guimaraes Jorge--He demands to be called 
Captain Guimaraes because he was an Army officer, but was 
expelled from the force over smuggling charges. He is listed by 
human rights groups as a torturer at the Doi-Codi [International 
Operations Department-Internal Defense Operations Center]. He 
is a former president of the Independent League of Samba Schools 
(Liesa). He controls the numbers game in Niteroi and in the 
Lagos Region, but his businesses extend to Espirito Santo State 
and even to Paraguay. He has already been fined by the Federal 
Revenue Secretariat [SRF] in the amount of $120,000. He was 
also sentenced to six years in prison by Judge Denise Frossard 
on charges of belonging to an armed gang. At present he is 
serving time at Interpol, one of the various police 
organizations having taken graft from the illegal game operators. 
  Waldemir Paes Garcia--He is nickamed Miro. He is 
the richest among the numbers game kingpins. He is so rich that 
his colleagues only call him Bradesco [Brazilian Discount Bank]. 
He patronizes the Unidos do Salgueiro samba school and controls 
the numbers game in Tijuca, Vila Isabel, and Andarai. He owns 
casinos and ranches in Paraguay. He gained power and money when 
he inherited the businesses of his then partner Angelo Maria 
Longas, known as Uncle Scrooge, who died in 1987. In 1988, he 
was arrested by federal agents who broke into the Barao de 
Drumond Casino in the Baixada Fluminense. Miro is the father of 
Waldemiro Garcia, nicknamed Maninho, who was almost expelled 
from the numbers game leadership for having opened fire on actor 
Tarcisio Meira Filho and Carlos Gustavo Santos Moreira, aka 
Grelha, whom he left paralyzed. Father and son were sentenced 
last year to six years in prison. They are both serving time at 
the Ferreira Vieira Neto Prison in Niteroi. 
  Raul Correa de Mello--Raul Capitao is 84 years 
old. In addition to being the oldest, he is also one of the 
richest among the numbers game kingpins. He controls the game 
downtown, in the Ilha do Governador, and in other states. Marco 
Aurelio, a son of Raul Capitao, was murdered in 1987, presumably 
on orders of the other kingpins. This incident shook the 
numbers game structure. Because of his old age and poor 
health--he suffers from Parkinson's disease--the Superior Court 
granted him a writ of habeas corpus so that he may stay free 
while his appeal of the sentence of Judge Denise Frossard--who 
sentenced him to six years in prison on charges of belonging to 
an armed gang--is heard. 
  Carlos Teixeira Martins--A Portuguese citizen, 
whose nickname is Carlinhos Maracana, patronizes the Portela 
samba school and the Bangu soccer club. He owns a chain of 
supermarkets and is, among the kingpins, the one who has had 
most contacts with politicians. During the administration of 
Moreira Franco, he was decorated with the Pedro Ernesto Medal, 
the highest honor conferred by the Rio de Janeiro City Council. 
He controls hundreds of game points in the suburbs, especially 
in Madureria, Pavuna, and Rocha Miranda, as well as in Brasilia. 
He was also sentenced to six years in prison and is serving 
time at the Vieira Ferreira Neto Prison in Niteroi. Their ward 
is known as the Place of the Yellow Woodpecker [Sitio do 
Pica-pau Amarelo]--a reference to the comfort enjoyed there by 
the inmates. Unlike the other kingpins, Carlinhos Maracana has 
no direct heirs. Thus, his businesses are being administered by 
advisers. 
  Antonio Petrus Kalil--In addition to being a 
numbers game kingpin, Turcao is also a prosperous owner of 
restaurants. He controls hundreds of numbers game points in 
Alcantara, Niteroi, Rio (the port area), Minas Gerais, and 
Bahia. He was charged with having ordered the murder of Bahia 
numbers kingpin Luis Carlos Teles de Lima three years ago to 
take control of the game in Salvador. He was fined $5,000 by 
the SRF on charges of tax evasion. Castor de Andrade, Captain 
Guimaraes, and Turcao make up the golden trio of kingpins in Rio 
de Janeiro. Turcao could replace Castor, who has lost face 
after his ``oversight'' that enabled the Rio de Janeiro district 
attorney to disclose the numbers game accounting records. Turcao 
is serving a six-year term at the Ferreira Vieira Neto Prison in 
Niteroi. 
  Jose Petrus Kalil--He is nicknamed Zinho. He is 
the self-styled spokesman of the numbers game kingpins. He is 
an economist and a brother of Turcao. He used to patronize the 
Mangueira samba school, but now patronizes the Estacio de Sa 
school. He controls points in the downtown area. He is the 
most discreet among the kingpins because he has been rarely seen 
in parties or in the company of distinguished people. A former 
partner of kingpin Manuel Nunes Cid, known as Manola, Zinho 
became a member of the select group of commanders of the numbers 
game after the death of his partner. Today, he owns several real 
estate properties and runs game points throughout the city. 
Last year, he was sentenced to six years in prison on charges 
of belonging to an armed gang. Because he is a university 
graduate, he has been remanded to custody at a special section 
of Interpol until his appeal against Judge Denise Frossard's 
sentence is heard. 
  Jose Caruzzo Escafura--He is also known as 
Piruinha. He controls the numbers game in the northern zone of 
Rio de Janeiro, especially in the neighborhoods of Meier, 
Engenho de Dentro, and Abolicao, where he resides with his 
entire family. In 1992, car thieves stole a car at gunpoint 
from a woman, but they returned the car to her as soon as they 
found out that she was related to Piruinha. A few weeks ago, 
one of his grandsons was kidnapped, but he reappeared a few days 
later. Sentenced with the other kingpins, Piruinha is serving 
time at the Ari Franco Prison. He owns entertainment places and 
a chain of motels--including one in Jacarepagua, in the western 
zone, which was meant to become a large, luxurious casino. The 
SRF found out that he owns more than 100 real estate properties. 
He has had 14 children by 12 women. He is often visited in 
prison by his women (together). 
  Haroldo Rodrigues Nunes--In the numbers game 
underworld, he is known as Haroldo Saenz Pena. He owns 
lucrative game points in Tijuca, a traditional neighborhood in 
northern Rio de Janeiro. He claims to be just ``a simple 
citizen living on an INSS [National Social Security Institute] 
pension,'' a retired cab driver. He recently sold a shiny 
Mercedes Benz and a boat, even though he has not had financial 
problems for several years. A discreet man, he is one of the 
most powerful numbers game kingpins. Like Carlinhos Maracana, 
Haroldo does not have a direct heir and, while he is serving 
time for six years at the Niteroi prison on charges of belonging 
to an armed gang, his businesses are being run by his managers. 
  Luiz Pacheco Drumond--He is known as Luizinho da 
Imperatriz, in reference to the Imperatriz samba school of 
Leopoldina, which won the latest carnival samba parade. He 
controls the numbers game in the entire Leopoldina area. In 
1991, the SRF concluded that he could not justify his wealth and 
imposed on him a $24,000 fine. His son Marquinhos Drumond is 
president of Imperatriz and is a councilman for the Liberal 
Party. Marquinhos also served as vice president of the Botafogo 
soccer club during the tenure of kingpin Emil Pinheiro. 
Luisinho is considered to be one of the most violent numbers 
game kingpins, and is suspected of having ordered the death of 
one nephew. He is serving a six-year prison term at the 
Ferreira Vieira Neto prison. 
  Emil Pinheiro--He owns a fortune, including a 
princely mansion in Angra dos Reis, outside of which he used to 
anchor a huge yacht. A passionate soccer lover, he decided to 
assume control of the Botafogo soccer club. He bought several 
players for the club and managed to have the team win a 
championship after 21 years. He controls game points in the 
southern zone. Nearly five years ago, he was accused of causing 
the death of a manager of the numbers game in Jacarepagua. It 
should also be noted that his partner mysteriously disappeared 
in 1976. He owns several real estate properties in the Barra da 
Tijuca area. He had health problems while serving time at 
Interpol. He was then taken to the Army Central Hospital, where 
he has been staying for 10 months. Last week the Superior Court 
turned down a petition for him to go free while his appeal of 
Judge Denise Frossard's sentence is heard. 
  Jose Carlos Monassa--He controls the game in 
Niteroi and Sao Goncalo in Greater Rio. He shares some points 
with Turcao. He is president of the Unidos do Viradouro samba 
school which, thanks to his sponsor, has made it to the special 
group for the past two years. One of his sons is married to the 
daughter of a criminal judge. He was the only numbers game 
``kingpin'' who was not sentenced by Judge Denise Frossard, but 
he was sentenced in March to six years on charges of belonging 
to an armed gang. In Minas Gerais State, he is charged with a 
count of murder. He remains at large.

  [Text] A secret Army report, the details of which were 
obtained by O ESTADO, establishes the precise moment at which 
the Rio de Janeiro numbers game became involved with drug 
trafficking. The report, which was prepared at the request of 
the Eastern Military Command, mentions a 1981 meeting between 
numbers game chiefs--represented by Aniz Abrahao Davi, known as 
Anisio, from Beija-Flor; Ailton Guimaraes Jorge, known as 
Capitao Guimaraes; and Toninho Turco, one of Rio de Janeiro's 
major drug traffickers who was killed during a major police 
operation in February 1988. 
  At the 1981 meeting--according to the Army report--it was 
decided that the numbers game people would finance drug 
trafficking in Rio de Janeiro, and that Turco, Anisio, and 
Guimaraes would be responsible for all drug movements into and 
out of the city. In addition, they also would be responsible for 
the trafficking of smuggled arms. 
  A former Army captain who engaged in political repression as 
a member of the DOI-CODI [Department of Domestic 
Operations-Internal Defense Operations Center], Ailton Guimaraes 
Jorge had been under investigation by the Armed Forces since 
1974, when his name appeared in a military inquest in which he 
was charged with smuggling and extortion. At the end of the 
1970's, he left the Army and joined the numbers game. 
  Says the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] deputy for Rio de 
Janeiro, Miro Teixeira: ``Capitao Guimaraes gave the numbers 
game chiefs all the know-how in weapons and smuggling that he 
learned from DOI-CODI. His joining the numbers game was 
simultaneous with the appearance of the link with drug 
trafficking.'' 
  Before that, in 1976, when the progress of the federal 
lotteries posed a financial threat to the numbers game, the 
alliance with drug trafficking was already in design. Top Rio de 
Janeiro numbers game chiefs met and decided that they had to 
``professionalize'' the business. In that year, numbers game 
chiefs met for the first time with U.S. citizen Joe Conforte, 
one of the entrepreneurs who controlled gambling in Las Vegas 
and whose name was linked with drug trafficking. 
  During Carnival 1982, one year after a meeting between 
Toninho Turco, Anisio, and Guimaraes, Conforte returned to Rio 
de Janeiro and was welcomed in the theater box of numbers game 
chief Castor de Andrade. He had Moet et Chandon champagne, 
Iranian caviar, lobster, and tropical fruit as dessert. This was 
the final signal that the numbers game would no longer be the 
``innocent'' activity of the 1960's and 1970's. 
  As of that time, Guimaraes and Castor vied for control of 
operations. Guimaraes was the first game chief to control his 
business with computers and to expand his activities to other 
states. He also was designated president of the League of Samba 
Schools--an activity that cleans up the image of game chiefs in 
the eyes of the people. Despite the fact that he was arrested 
one year ago at Polinter on charges of illegal association and 
creation of armed gangs, he is considered the natural successor 
to Castor de Andrade. 
  At a recent meeting in his gasoline station in Bangu, which 
was also used as an accounting office for the numbers game, 
Castor de Andrade reportedly said to some of his employees that 
he suspected Guimaraes. A maneuver to replace him in the game 
might have been under way. After the collapse of Castor de 
Andrade's operation, many people in Bangu began to openly 
disclose the names of the police and attorney general informers.

Alexandre Dupeyrat and the government leaders in Congress, 
President Itamar Franco today will begin discussing the 
possibility of the federal government exploiting the numbers 
game. The government considers this to be ``an emergency 
solution'' to fight the widespread corruption system set up by 
the numbers game kingpins around betting places. According to 
Pedro Simon (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do 
Sul State), who is the government leader in the Senate, the 
inclusion of the numbers game on the list of crimes forced it to 
go underground and to generate a system of ``related crimes,'' 
such as trafficking in drugs and arms and holdups of armored 
bank vans. 
  Minister Dupeyrat will propose at the meeting that the 
numbers game continue to be considered an illegal activity if it 
is exploited without the government's authorization. He claims 
that to simply legalize it--as proposed by some--would only 
benefit those offenders who now are facing charges because the 
courts would then have to dismiss all charges. Dupeyrat 
believes the problem may be solved by authorizing the Federal 
Savings Bank (CEF) or another government institution to exploit 
the game to compete with the illegal operators. 
  Dupeyrat said: ``The numbers game is being exploited by 
criminals who are obtaining very high profits because they are 
withholding part of the prizes.'' He added: ``If the game is 
exploited adequately and if higher prizes are distributed to 
bettors, the people will prefer the government-run game.'' 
Planalto Palace expects to learn today whether the CEF has the 
capability to include another betting game in its lottery system. 
  Sen. Simon believes, however, that a solution should start 
by 
excluding the numbers game from the list of crimes and by 
legalizing it. He wants it to become a legal activity that 
would be supervised by the government and would be liable for 
taxes. He said: ``That would put an end to payments of bribes 
to policemen and government officials.'' He added: ``It also 
would become much easier to fight the number of crimes 
surrounding betting places.'' Playing on Simon's side is the 
fact that he ``legalized'' the numbers game upon his 
inauguration as governor of Rio Grande do Sul as soon as he 
realized that one-third of police personnel in the state were 
officially assigned to fighting this crime, but that in reality 
they were only offering protection in exchange for kickbacks. 
  The proposal now being discussed by the government will 
block 
a Congress vote on a previous proposal that virtually reserves 
the market for the current numbers game operators. The bill, 
which already has been approved by the Constitution and Justice 
Committee, legalizes the numbers game and authorizes its current 
operators to continue to exploit it exclusively. The proposal, 
which was endorsed by the Rio de Janeiro kingpins, was sponsored 
by Deputy Paulo Almeida (Democratic Social Party-Rio de 
Janeiro), who is the president of the League of Samba Schools, 
Liesa.

  [Text] Police have learned how the illegal numbers lottery 
money is laundered. Another illegal lottery betting place was 
busted by police in Rio de Janeiro today. Police believe some 
betting places are changing their location as a result of the 
investigations. Police this morning confiscated this material as 
it was taken from the Copacabana district to another southern 
Rio de Janeiro district. 
  Federal Police learned how the illegal lottery money 
laundering scheme works. It is done through the Acaray Casino in 
Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. One of the casino owners is illegal 
lottery banker Waldomiro Garcia, aka Miro, who uses the casino 
to justify a good portion of the illegal lottery money that is 
registered as profits from the casino. 
  The illegal lottery bankers also use the Uruguayan financial 
market to launder the money produced by other illegal 
businesses. This money circulates through Montevideo banks as if 
it were money from Uruguayan companies that make large 
investments in Punta del Este's real estate market. These are 
fictitious businesses that always render fantastic profits. 
  The money leaves Rio de Janeiro, goes to Paraguay, and then 
to Uruguay. From there, already converted into clean money, it 
is sent to fiscal paradises like Bahamas, Cayman, and Virgin 
Islands. In the end, the money circulates normally in the 
international financial market. 
  The illegal lottery bankers charge from 10 to 15 percent to 
facilitate the laundering of money both in Uruguay and Paraguay. 
After the money is laundered abroad through several financial 
method, the money returns to Brazil as foreign investments. It 
is as if I lend my money to myself through a foreign company, 
apply it in the Brazilian financial market, then repay the money 
to myself with interest, and then once again send it all abroad.

<F P=106> [Article: ``PF Seizes $100,000 in Counterfeit Dollars in </F>
Manaus''] 
  [Text] Manaus--Federal Police [PF] seized $100,000 in 
counterfeit dollars disguised as money belts on the legs and 
around the waists of passengers Juarez de Paula Sobrinho, 37, 
and Artemio Nunes de Souza, 49, at the Eduardo Gomes 
International Airport early yesterday morning. 
  The PF made a similar seizure on the 23d of last month when 
it found $36,000 in the luggage of passenger Eldon Barreira 
Castelo Branco, 25. In both cases, the route was the same: the 
passengers had boarded a Varig flight bound for Manaus from the 
municipality of Tabatinga, Amazonas, across the border from 
Leticia, Colombia. 
  Paula Sobrinho and Nunes de Souza were approached by police 
as they were waiting for the connecting flight to Para. Giving 
an appearance of calm, they both denied carrying anything 
illegal, but upon being searched, they were found to be in 
possession of the false banknotes. The dollars had been packed 
in bundles, each containing $10,000 in $100 bills. Paula 
Sobrinho and Nuno de Souza had covered the packages with plastic 
and attached them to their bodies using adhesive tape. Upon 
being caught in the act, the passengers told Police Chief 
Claudio Rosas that the money had been acquired in Tabatinga. As 
had been true with the dollars seized from Castelo Branco on the 
23d, the PF discovered that the almost perfect banknotes were 
counterfeit only after expert analysis. 
  Police Chief Rosas said that the two passengers must belong 
to the same gang as Castelo Branco. That gang seems to be part 
of an international scheme, since there have been other seizures 
in various places around the country. According to him, the 
dollars are probably being produced in Leticia. The Federal 
Police want to conduct a joint investigation with Colombian 
police.

  [Text] Federal Police have begun to break up the Nigerian 
cocaine connection. Police believe that nearly a metric ton of 
cocaine per year still leaves Brazil and is taken to Nigeria. 
Following a year of investigations, Federal Police unveiled the 
daring African cocaine trafficking scheme. 
  The drug leaves Bolivia, is sold in Sao Paulo for $5,000 per 
kilo, and then is taken by the traffickers to Lagos, Nigeria. 
There, it is worth $17,000 per kilo. From Lagos, the cocaine 
is taken to Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, 
and Canada, where a kilogram of cocaine can reach the price of 
$60,000. 
  Given the Nigerian cocaine trafficking route, all passengers 
on the weekly flight to Lagos are filmed in the airport. 
Suspects are followed day and night by police. The tactic has 
worked. Since the beginning of the year, Federal Police have 
arrested 14 drug traffickers red-handed in Guarulhos 
International Airport, Sao Paulo, and confiscated 100 kg of 
cocaine from them. 
  The confiscations reveal that the Nigerians are experts in 
camouflaging the drug. These are some of the objects used by 
the Nigerians: The drug can be hidden inside a spray can that, 
like this one, can hide up to 300 grams of cocaine. Cocaine 
also was found in the inner soles of tennis shoes. Drug 
traffickers normally create double-bottom suitcases. Nigerians 
go beyond this. The whole structure of this suitcase is pure 
cocaine that, mixed with a resin, has been shaped into a 
suitcase. The most difficult way to detect cocaine, but also 
the most dangerous for the drug trafficker, is cocaine capsules. 
Nigerians can swallow up to 60 capsules at once. They thus use 
their own body to hide the drugs.

<F P=106> [``Text'' of letter by Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo </F>
de Greiff to U.S. Senator John Kerry; date not given] 
  [Text] Senator [John] Kerry's article, which he wrote 
instead of conducting a rational debate, which from my point of 
view is our only hope if we are to find a solution to a social 
problem of such great magnitude, is a long chain of personal 
attacks [ad hominem] that are not in accordance with your 
position nor are they appropriate comments on a high-level 
official of a sovereign state. But for the time being I will 
ignore them so as not to lose focus on what is truly important. 
  However, some clarifications are important because the 
senator is short on the truth. The senator is mistaken on the 
following issues: 
  1. It is not true that I held secret negotiations with 
members of the so-called ``Cali Cartel.'' I believe that only 
distance and access to only selected articles could have led the 
senator to this conclusion. A law promoted by the Gaviria 
administration gives those who are suspected of involvement in 
criminal activities the opportunity to surrender to the district 
attorney and to request an investigation in the hopes of 
clarifying their legal situation. The cases I believe the 
senator is thinking of are those involving Helmer Herrera, Juan 
Ramirez, and Jose Olmedo Ocampo, who came to my office on 11, 
13, and 14 January, respectively, to request the aforementioned 
investigation. As stated in the law, my office issued a 
communique reporting on the facts. 
The points that must be stressed are the following: a) All 
the procedures were conducted according to Colombian law. b) 
There was nothing secret about the contacts that were required 
by law and that led to the issuance of a public document. 
Furthermore, and as established by the law, my office notified 
the other Colombian judicial agencies and, at the same time, 
asked the foreign governments (including Italy, France, Germany, 
and the United States) to provide any legal evidence they might 
have against these people. c) The documents these men received 
following their visit to my office grant them no legal immunity 
nor any advantage. The documents simply establish the facts and 
purpose of their visit. Therefore, these harmless documents have 
no bearing on the investigation. This whole incident is much 
ado about nothing. Our capacity to prosecute these individuals 
has not been jeopardized; furthermore, it could not have been 
jeopardized for several reasons established in Colombian laws 
and statutes. 
  2. The senator's knowledge of Colombia is not precise. At 
all the forums to which I have access (including THE WASHINGTON 
POST article the senator is responding to), I have unceasingly 
talked about the horrible impact the drug traffickers, 
regardless of where they may come from, have on Colombia. As a 
matter of fact, the generous popular support I still enjoy in 
Colombia is due to my determination to not only speak, but also 
act against drug traffickers in general. However, for the 
record, the senator is mistaken about which crimes are credited 
to which cartel. I cannot blame the senator for this since the 
cartels have been disastrous to this country, and keeping 
straight who did what is not an easy task. But even keeping this 
in mind, the story the senator writes in his article is nothing 
more than a story; the exact same accusations--participation in 
the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan (true), massive public 
relations campaigning against the extradition law (true), active 
campaigning during the constitutional reforms (true)--were made 
against the Medellin Cartel throughout the long process of the 
abolition of the extradition treaty and later during the 
approval of the laws on sentence negotiations promoted by the 
Gaviria administration. 
  The same ``story'' is being told again today with different 
actors. One begins to ask oneself what interests are hidden 
behind this story; could it be that there are people in the U.S. 
Senate who would like to see the continuation of exactly the 
same struggle, at a safe distance from the United States, rather 
than considering alternatives that would distribute the burden 
of a war against drugs more equally? Senator, on this point 
there can be do doubt; the question from my view point is not 
how should we surrender in light of the drug problem, but 
rather, how should we deal with it more effectively. Much of 
the progress Colombia has recently made in this field can be 
attributed to the institutional reorganization resulting from 
the 1991 Constitution, a reorganization created by the office I 
currently hold, which has been an instrument in the efforts to 
ensure that the law in my country is respected. But it is still 
necessary to do more, because, despite the new institutions, I 
cannot see clearly that we are winning this war. 
  3. Senator Kerry is mistaken when he says that Julio Fabio 
Urdinola--a drug trafficker who surrendered to the Colombian 
authorities on 11 March--``when negotiating his agreement, made 
use of an idea inspired by Cali, according to which, there is no 
Cali Cartel, rather, individual drug traffickers acting 
independently.'' This argument was not used by Urdinola (but how 
could the senator know whether it was or was not used?), simply 
because it is irrelevant. The crime for which we are accusing 
Urdinola is trafficking cocaine; therefore, the existence or 
nonexistence of the Cali Cartel is irrelevant. Senator Kerry 
may not like the idea of facing the fact that the Cali 
traffickers are not members of a cartel. But, of course, no 
action or rhetoric on his part can change the facts. By the 
way, in light of the little evidence that the U.S. and Colombian 
Governments have against the members of the alleged Cali Cartel, 
I do not understand the senator's apprehension about our using 
sentence negotiation against the Cali traffickers. I believe 
that, as long as we are thorough and demanding in the terms of 
such agreements, we will have more opportunities to obtain 
information on other traffickers than we would if we acted as we 
did in the past. 
  4. Senator Kerry is mistaken in stating that Urdinola ``now 
faces only five years in prison.'' I believe I know about this 
because my office is responsible for those procedures. The 
length of Urdinola's sentence has not yet been discussed by the 
Prosecutor General's office. At this time I will take advantage 
of the opportunity to reiterate that debates on drug policy 
should not be based only on rational arguments but also on truth. 
  Now that this has been clarified, please allow me to stress 
some points made in the article the senator is responding to, as 
well as other statements I have made on this subject: 
  1. In my opinion, the antidrug policy must be guided by two 
goals: the reduction of trafficking and use and the dismantling 
of organized crime (yes, Mr. Kerry, this includes the ``Cali 
Cartel,'' as well as organized crime in New York, Los Angeles, 
Houston, Chicago, Boston, etc.). The drug policy must also be 
guided by an important down-to-earth preference in favor of 
multilateral decisions, decisions made on the basis of respect 
and mutual understanding, not on disinformation and a 
presumptuous double standard. 
  2. Senator Kerry's answer to my article, to the extent that 
his answers contain an argument, takes it for granted that I am 
willing to consider legalization in terms of a free market. 
Nevertheless, I want to think about legalization models to break 
the economic backbone of the drug traffickers (yes, Mr. Kerry, 
the economic backbone of the Cali traffickers also), without 
increasing the supply. Again and again, I have said that my 
interest in considering legalization depends on the possibility 
of devising a suitable model to reach the goals mentioned 
earlier. 
  3. Senator Kerry has chosen to ignore the terms under which 
I 
defend the use of sentence negotiations. I have clearly said 
that this negotiation can be a useful instrument to the extent 
that we can obtain something that neither the United States nor 
Colombia has obtained so far, despite all their efforts: the 
cessation of all drug-related activities, full information on 
the participants in all involved countries, operational modes, 
location of laboratories, points of entry, financial 
transactions, etc. In addition, I have said that such 
agreements should not prevent the prosecution of both those who 
fail to abide by the agreements and those who refuse to provide 
full information. 
  4. Senator Kerry's insistence on the Cali Cartel's existence 
suggests that he knows something we do not know. This leads me 
to reiterate my request for a more effective information 
exchange. There is only one way to settle the question of the 
Cali Cartel's existence: by presenting evidence that supports 
the statement. Both in word and deed, I have always been willing 
to file charges against drug traffickers. It goes without 
saying, of course, that I need evidence to do this. If the 
senator possesses this evidence, we are prepared to use it. 
  Finally, I reiterate that a rational debate on the subject 
is 
essential. This involves listening to arguments and refraining 
from questioning the moral character of the participants in the 
debate solely because they hold a different viewpoint (something 
easy to do from Washington's comfortable distance). [Signed] 
Gustavo de Greiff R., prosecutor general.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff yesterday asked 
the Congress of the Republic to investigate him, if it suspects 
he has cooperated with drug trafficking, as charged by some 
persons. Among the accusers are U.S. Senator John Kerry and 
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. 
  The high-ranking judicial official also requested the 
Executive Branch to create the necessary conditions for harmonic 
cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking. This is 
the reason he held a meeting yesterday with Attorney General 
Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. 
  De Greiff, during a new conference upon his return from 
abroad, said that Colombia is possibly giving in to pressure 
from U.S. officials and one senator. In this regard, the 
prosecutor gave as an example the letter that Gabriel Silva, 
Colombia's ambassador to the United States, sent to Senator John 
Kerry in which he explains the Executive Branch's position on 
the surrender policy to justice. In addition, he indicates that 
the government ``opposes the surrender of drug traffickers under 
conditions inconsistent with their level of criminal guilt.'' 
Meanwhile it suggests that De Greiff seeks the opposite by 
indicating that the prosecutor's opinions are not those of the 
Executive Branch. 
  In this regard De Greiff said: ``When, how, and where has 
the 
Prosecutor General's Office or specifically the prosecutor 
general sought something different? Quietly but firmly I ask 
those who have been involved in episodes to present any evidence 
they may have on this. Furthermore, I ask the competent 
institutions, in this case the Congress, to investigate if it is 
true or not that the prosecutor general has cooperated with drug 
trafficking, as is published in the same daily that invented the 
wanted pardon or amnesty (for the drug traffickers who surrender 
to justice).'' 
  In addition, the prosecutor general said that to strive for 
the cooperation from another nation to be received with the 
commitment to previously consult with the nation that is 
cooperating, on the use it will give to the evidence supplied or 
on the legal measures that these could justify, would be an 
attack on sovereignty. ``I have been and I am in favor of the 
nations' legal cooperation with Colombia in my country's 
solitary or practically solitary struggle against the drug 
trafficking scourge. However, this has to take place within the 
bases of respect for sovereignty, and fundamentally within the 
parameters of independence in the Judicial Branch and in keeping 
with the constitutional and legal provisions on the matter,'' De 
Greiff said. 
  The prosecutor, referring to a letter he sent to a U.S. 
judge, in which it is indicated that in Colombia there is no 
evidence that Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, alias ``La Quica,'' was 
involved in the Avianca airplane explosion, he said that this 
was distorted by some media. De Greiff said that all he pursued 
with that letter was for that nation's judicial official to be 
informed of some facts relevant to a decision he should have or 
would have to make, but in no case did he attempt to mediate for 
any specific individual. 
  To defend his action, the prosecutor general based his 
procedure on a court decision issued by the Constitutional Court 
that states: ``the omission of a judicial action on which is 
based the exercise of a fundamental right escapes all 
justification and de-naturalizes the legal aspect, turning it 
into a mere exercise of power in the abnormal exercise of 
jurisdictional duty.'' 
  Meanwhile, De Greiff announced a new tone in his relations 
with the media given that ``some media with criteria I do not 
want to label--that everyone should label according to his 
conscious and his heart, as Dr. Eduardo Santos used to say--have 
interpreted in their own fashion the measures that in given 
cases the prosecutor general has taken, and what is even worse, 
they have distorted them...'' For this reason, the high-ranking 
judicial official announced that from now on he would 
communicate with the media in writing in the briefest form 
possible and through press communiques. 
  The prosecutor general also made reference to the situation 
of the bishops who allegedly have cooperated with the 
guerrillas. In this regard he said ``it is not true that the 
Prosecutor General's Office has voiced its opinion on its 
agreement or disagreement on the testimonies of cooperation with 
subversive groups.''

<F P=106> [From the ``National Newscast''] </F>
  [Text] It will be legally possible to confiscate assets 
owned by drug traffickers. A Constitutional Court ruling has 
given the green light to legislation that authorizes the 
expropriation of property owned by persons charged with 
illegally acquiring wealth. 
  By backing the Vienna Convention, the United Nation's 
highest 
treaty on drug trafficking, the Constitutional Court has 
endorsed one of the leading mechanisms to fight this scourge in 
Colombia. Authorities are convinced that with this endorsement 
of the treaty it will be easier to confront drug traffickers. 
  [Begin Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez recording] 
It is an international instrument that is essential in the fight 
against drugs trafficking in all of its phases, such as money 
laundering, taking drugs, and diverting chemicals used in 
processing cocaine. [end recording] 
  The Court has ruled that, from now on and through a judicial 
procedure, seizing goods that originated in drug trafficking or 
goods that represent illegal acquisition of wealth can be 
authorized. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] The Vienna Convention 
is important because other countries can imitate us. It will be 
possible to establish regulations and agreements to complement 
the Vienna Convention in order to freeze drug 
trafficking-originated goods. It is also an essential 
instrument in breaking organized crime's financial backbone. 
[end recording] 
  The nonextradition of Colombian citizens was also agreed 
upon 
during the revision of the Vienna Convention.

  [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has 
described certain decisions by Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff as being ``isolated,'' and he said such decisions 
generate reactions that make people question their institutions 
and their coworkers. 
  ``I am respectfully calling on the prosecutor general to 
stop 
making isolated decisions that can adversely affect the 
country's criminal policy,'' Arrieta said. 
  The attorney general also referred to Justice Minister 
Andres 
Gonzalez's position: ``I have observed with irony and sadness 
how, by way of a letter a few days ago, the justice minister has 
established conditions for subjecting drug traffickers to 
justice, even though more than a year ago the Attorney General's 
Office had requested the inclusion of these same conditions in 
the Criminal Code.'' 
  Arrieta spoke to journalists yesterday to explain his views 
regarding the controversy that has emerged in the relations 
between U.S. officials and the Colombian Prosecutor General's 
Office, and he called on De Greiff to act in harmony and to 
cooperate with other institutions. 
  He added: ``Serious harm will be done to Colombia and all of 
its citizens when, by way of isolated decisions, certain 
reactions are generated that make people question their 
institutions and their peers, because for every criminal there 
are thousands of decent citizens who are demanding respect for 
their dignity and rights.'' 
  According to the attorney general, the prosecutor general's 
isolated statements and decisions should not be allowed to 
endanger the state's criminal policy, because ``no institution 
can claim for itself the exclusive handling of the state's 
criminal policy.'' He added: ``There is a constitutional 
mandate that calls for harmony and cooperation among all 
branches of government. It is necessary to understand that the 
legal strategies of prohibition and prevention should parallel 
one another and be harmonious within the state.'' 
  The attorney general added: ``I do not want this statement 
to 
be interpreted as if I am supporting someone. I simply want to 
make a constructive contribution toward resolving a national 
problem that has resulted in serious consequences, such as the 
labeling of Colombia as a narcodemocracy.'' 
  Arrieta admitted that the current Criminal Code is a failure 
because of all of its legal flaws and contradictions. He said 
the drug traffickers' lawyers have taken advantage of these 
shortcomings. 
  Arrieta said: ``The lack of standards has prompted attorneys 
for drug traffickers to try to obtain more favorable conditions 
for their clients.'' The problems with the code, according to 
the high-ranking official, can be summarized this way: ``There 
are confusing standards in terms of protocol, advantages and 
benefits of the law, and the application of differing views, and 
these eventually lead to lenient decisions.'' 
  Arrieta also said there are documents that prove that since 
February 1992 the Attorney General's Office has been insisting 
on the need for a tougher Criminal Code. 
<H5>  Another Criminal Code </H5>
  Arrieta said: ``It is no secret that the Attorney General's 
Office was the only office that originally opposed the reform of 
the Criminal Code, because it believed the discretionary powers 
given to prosecutors in doling out benefits were too broad.'' 
The attorney general said there are 60-70 criminal policy 
standards, but he added that all of these are confusing and 
contradictory. ``This is why, according to the Attorney 
General's Office, as far as the struggle against drug 
trafficking is concerned, it is important for the government, 
the Congress, and the judicial branch to assume the challenge of 
issuing as soon as possible significant procedural standards 
that reflect a clear-cut criminal policy.'' 
  The attorney general said the new criminal code must include 
guidelines for meting out sentences that correspond to the 
seriousness of the crime. He said: ``They should offer viable 
judicial alternatives that will generate neither impunity nor a 
sense of impunity.'' 
  While waiting for these kinds of reforms, Arrieta promised 
``to proceed forcefully and seriously in such a way that those 
guilty of crimes receive punishment that correspond to their 
acts.'' He also said he will continue to work within the 
framework of the legal and constitutional responsibilities the 
Attorney General's Office has in criminal cases. 
  Arrieta added: ``If, as a state, we are unable to promote a 
comprehensive Criminal Code which features sentences that are 
proportional to the crimes, and which establishes clear criteria 
for the application of benefits, then something seriously wrong 
here.''

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Attorney General Carlos </F>
Gustavo Arrieta by unidentified reporter; from ``Caracol's 0600 
to 0900'' newscast--live] 
  [Text] The big news in the last few hours was a news 
conference by Prosecutor General Dr. Gustavo de Greiff 
yesterday. Dr. de Greiff clearly refuted U.S. Senator John Kerry 
and revealed the text of a letter his office sent Kerry days ago 
indicating the mistakes and untruths presumably contained in the 
senator's statements on the drug trafficking problem in our 
country and on the efforts of the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  The prosecutor general also criticized the national 
government and--if you read between the lines--the Justice 
Ministry. De Greiff told reporters that the justice 
minister--on behalf of the executive branch--defended [words 
indistinct], as it is commonly said, before Congress, a bill 
that would later become the nation's new penal code, which is 
the center of controversy right now. 
  De Greiff also lashed out at certain media, accusing them of 
not having read the documents in question. He accused the media 
of distorting his position toward La Quica [Dandeny Munoz 
Mosquera] and the letter he sent the U.S. judge handling the 
case. In sum, the prosecutor's decision not to step down will 
leave much to be done and ample material for comment by the 
media. 
  Prosecutor General de Greiff urged the national government 
to 
work together against the drug trafficking cartels. He recalled 
that the executive branch worked intensively in discussing the 
issues and drafting the penal procedural code. As previously 
mentioned, the prosecutor general criticized the justice 
minister and said he does not understand why a decision that was 
discussed and jointly adopted is now being criticized. 
  That collaboration, that harmony among the various branches 
of public power to establish a common front against drug 
trafficking, was also demanded in due time by an official who 
has appeared to be conciliatory, who has served as a bridge in 
the reestablishment of talks between the prosecutor general and 
the president as well as with the justice minister. We are 
talking about Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. Good 
morning, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. 
  Arrieta: Good morning. How are you? 
  Reporter: What is your opinion about the documents 
revealed to the general public yesterday by Prosecutor General 
Gustavo de Greiff and about his news conference, especially the 
last part of it, when he requests greater harmony and 
cooperation among the branches of government to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  Arrieta: I think it is the most important part of 
the document. I am talking about the latter part, where the 
prosecutor general urges the executive branch to cooperate in 
the entire process, with the criminal policy, with the surrender 
policy. He pledged to do his part. De Greiff also reaffirmed 
his determination to continue fighting drug trafficking. 
  We all want to deal with the core of the problem [words 
indistinct] in the past months. I think that if the Prosecutor 
General's Office is clearly determined to contribute and 
participate in the [words indistinct], then we have taken an 
important step toward breaking the deadlock. 
  Reporter: The media have reported that the 
prosecutor general agreed, as the president did this week, with 
the presentation of a bill to Congress to reform certain rules 
of the penal procedural code. You met yesterday morning for 
several hours with Prosecutor General de Greiff. Were you able 
to discuss which chapters or issues of that penal procedural 
code should be reformed? 
  Arrieta: Frankly, this was an idea we had 
discussed on several occasions. We also discussed it with 
certain government officials and, fortunately for the country, 
there has been progress. 
  There is a consensus on the need to review certain points of 
the penal code and the code on penal procedures. The penal code 
brings together a series of legal provisions which, as I 
mentioned, are dispersed in more than 50 or 60 regulations. We 
need to review sentences and adjust certain aspects of the code 
on penal procedures that I think merit review, such as that 
which concerns automatic advantages [ventajas automaticas] and 
the implementation of certain benefits. 
  I dare say that there is almost a consensus, and I expect 
our 
proposal to be accepted so we can form a working group that will 
be able to quickly present a coherent draft to Congress. We 
cannot make mistakes. We will take a week to do things right, 
but I do hope that we will be in the position--I repeat--to 
present a draft to Congress in two or three months with the 
suggestions we have made plus those that the Prosecutor's Office 
feels are important, because Congress believes that it is vital 
that this draft be presented correctly. 
  Reporter: Based on what you just said, we can 
surmise that there are three basic aspects: the [word 
indistinct] of 50 or 60 regulations that are dispersed in 
various codes; the review of sentences that seem to be too 
short--there is a consensus about that in the country; and the 
review of what you termed automatic advantages and certain 
benefits for those who turn themselves in. Are there points of 
disagreement? 
  Arrieta: As for [words indistinct], I do not think 
there is any discrepancy. In that specific aspect, I do not 
think there is any disagreement; on the contrary, there is a 
consensus. I feel it is also important to mention the famous 
Article 369E, which was so controversial in its own time. Do 
you remember a couple of months ago when it was implied that 
certain people were being investigated by the prosecutor general. 
  Reporter: Is there a consensus on reforms to 
Article 369E? Does the justice minister, who so vigorously 
defended the way it was drafted at Congress, agree with it? 
  Arrieta: [Words indistinct] a small disagreement 
but precisely the work of the commission, made up by the group I 
mentioned, is aimed at ironing out differences so we can present 
a project on which we all agree. 
  Reporter: Could domestic and foreign critics be 
right in saying that we are lax in dealing with drug traffickers. 
  Arrieta: I think we must realize that the 
surrender policy and the methods by which it is implemented have 
had excellent results, but they have also created some problems. 
We must learn from our mistakes to improve the process. No one 
thought we would would perform miracles in one or two years. An 
important procedure was designed and it has had some clear 
results. We must learn from the mistakes made in the 
implementation of this policy. We must perfect the process 
until we have tools that will strengthen the state and allow us 
to have a clear and effective criminal policy within our laws. 
  When we talk about doing a review, it does not mean that 
what 
we did before did not work. It is something we must keep 
working on to fine tune these tools until they are right for the 
purposes for which they were intended. 
  Reporter: So you are telling us that we need a 
legal interpretation of how the principle of favorableness 
[principio de favorabilidad] of the criminal code will be 
applied in the event that standards that are currently 
considered favorable are reformed, making them stronger and more 
strict for people who are going to be tried. 
  Arrieta: You are right, just as you usually are 
when you comment on legal matters. The truth is that the 
principle of favorableness implies that some of the changes, 
especially substantial ones, could be applied only for crimes 
committed in the future. This is important because it has a 
preventive effect, an effect that could be useful for the 
country. 
  Reporter: What can be done so that U.S. officials, 
so Mr. Kerry or the U.S. attorney general, can agree with [words 
indistinct] penal code? 
  Arrieta: I truly do not believe [words indistinct] 
agree or disagree because Colombia is independent in that sense. 
I think the basic problem with the United States is a lack of 
communication. They should understand the vicissitudes, the 
difficulties, and the characteristics inherent to our national 
problems. I do not think they simply want us to have 
legislation that is similar or comparable to the existing 
legislation because the circumstances are very different. The 
idea is to come up with legislation that will be in keeping with 
our situation and that will give us the tools to fight crime and 
prevent impunity. I believe that [words indistinct] they will 
understand in the end. If one looks back one will find that 
there were very controversial decisions in the judiciary which 
could seem weak, but when they are analyzed under the current 
laws, they were not controversial per se, such as the [name 
indistinct] case, the case of the Ochoas, which involved [word 
indistinct] that, within the Colombian context, were very 
negative but in the end, the North Americans understood. That is 
why I say that the problem is not whether they accept or reject 
it, because Colombia is independent in these matters. It is a 
problem of [words indistinct] in consensus. [Words indistinct] 
in the face of controversial decisions [words indistinct] two or 
three behind [words indistinct] reasonably explain why certain 
decisions were made, and they understood in the end. [passage 
indistinct] have been asking [words indistinct] for coherence 
among all those concerned with this issue because [words 
indistinct] can present a united front with wise and reasonable 
explanations there is no reason to [words indistinct]. Our 
experience in these matters shows that the North Americans have 
not been [words indistinct] we have been the problem and thus we 
must think about our own laws in terms of our own criteria and 
what is best. 
  Reporter: With all due respect, Mr. Attorney 
General, one can understand correspondence and opinions coming 
and going between Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and Mrs. 
Reno. What one cannot understand, as a Colombian, is why pay so 
much attention to what Senator John Kerry has to say? Who is 
Sen. John Kerry? He is a U.S. senator, he is a very important 
person, he is very respectable, he is a writer for THE 
WASHINGTON POST, and so on, but is that enough to have a whole 
country paralyzed, to have its people divided and waiting for 
what a U.S. senator has to say? 
  Arrieta: That is why it is important to nip this 
in the bud. I found his statements yesterday interesting, from a 
certain standpoint. He defined the true dimensions of the 
problem and highlighted the basic fact that he is does not have 
a full understanding of some areas. I do agree with you, but 
this is not just any old senator. He is the chairman of the 
Senate Narcotics Commission. Nevertheless, I believe that as we 
move on and we explain these things to this fellow, we will 
surely be able to solve the problem in the end. In general 
terms, though, I do agree with you on this. 
  Reporter: Thank you sir. I have three different 
issues here. First, is it true that the Attorney General's 
Office has almost taken over the Administrative Department of 
Civil Aeronautics? 
  Arrieta: I would not really say takeover is the 
appropriate term. We have been working closely with them and we 
have had the full cooperation of the department's directors in 
solving several delicate problems. There were in fact a great 
many problems regarding investigation and such, so we decided to 
implement a permanent surveillance system. This was not just to 
solve the internal problems we found in security, corruption, 
and mismanagement in the area of licensing. Through this 
surveillance operation, without affecting the investigative 
process, we expect to assist them in the implementation of 
corrective measures within the department, in order for it to 
operate much better. To that end, I repeat, we have had the 
full cooperation of the department's administrative personnel. 
We are very pleased about this, because we can find the 
solutions if we continue to work together. We have found 
several very serious problems there and this cooperation system 
has allowed them to explain the situation. We will continue to 
have a permanent presence and continuous surveillance there. 
  Reporter: Another question. Is the prosecutor 
general getting his way, from a legal point of view, following 
the decision to transport five of Pablo Escobar's former 
lieutenants to participate in judicial proceedings going on 
Antioquia? 
  Arrieta: I do not think so, Dario. I do not thing 
anyone is getting their way. I think that this is a way of 
finding understanding among the parties. On the one hand we 
have the prosecutor general's wish to have these people in 
Medellin so the proceedings can progress. The government is 
getting its way as well, because there will not be a mass 
transfer, but one person at a time. That way we will not see 
any of the public security problems they believe could have 
occurred. I believe that what we are seeing here is a 
negotiated solution which tries to avert any possible public 
disturbance, while serving the prosecutor general's legal 
purposes. I do not think, then, that anyone is getting his way. 
  Reporter: Very well, we will have individual 
transfers. Will their stay at the Itagui Prison, in Medellin, 
be temporary or indefinite? 
  Arrieta: I believe it will just be temporary, 
Dario, until certain legal activities are completed, to ensure 
normal progress of the various cases. As soon as they finish 
they will return to Bogota, unless the conditions that led the 
government to object to the transfers still prevail. 
  Reporter: We thank you for this interview with 
Caracol, Mr. Attorney General. The last issue has to do with 
the order issued by the Attorney General's Office and carried 
out by the Armed Forces and the president. This was the 
dismissal of Gen. Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales. You had a full 
year to overturn the special prosecutor's sentence following the 
investigation and the legal proceedings. Why did you decide not 
to overturn that ruling? Why did you ratify your predecessor's 
ruling? 
  Arrieta: I think it is important that we set the 
record straight on this issue. This office could not legally 
overturn my predecessor's ruling. Legally, given the 
circumstances at that specific time, the ruling could not be 
revoked, whether I agreed with it or not. According to the law, 
once a case is filed under the jurisdiction of the 
administrative legal authorities, and that authority rules on 
the charges, their ruling cannot be revoked. The attorney 
general could not legally revoke the ruling, whether he agreed 
with it or not. 
  Reporter: Under the law and in your mind, did you 
agree with your predecessor's ruling? 
  Arrieta: Dario, it is very difficult for me to 
answer that, but let me say what I have said on several 
occasions. When we examined the case we found that there were 
certain additional issues that should have been investigated, 
particularly in two areas. The first question was which higher 
ranking officer gave Gen. Arias Cabrales certain orders 
regarding the operation? I do not mean civilian authorities; I 
mean the military authorities that participated in the 
operation, besides Gen. Cabrales. Then there is a question of 
who was involved in the specific action that prompted the 
Attorney General's Office to investigate--the events that took 
place in the restroom located between the third and fourth 
floors of the Justice Palace. 
  I think it is important to make one point here, Dario. When 
the Attorney General's Office examined the case, it did not 
examine the operation in general. Many believe that the 
office's decision was against the reaction, the use of the 
tanks, the fierceness, the violence, and so on, and that is just 
not true. The ruling has to do with the specific and precise 
events that took place on 6 and 7 November--particularly 7 
November--in the restroom between the third and fourth floors. 
  Reporter: You mean the alleged abuses and 
excessive use of force the Armed Forces displayed? 
  Arrieta: Dario, the Attorney General's Office 
argued that when these events took place, the Palace had almost 
been recovered and there was almost no resistance. The hostages 
were concentrated at specific locations and the rebels were also 
grouped together. The Attorney General's Office found what went 
on in the restroom between the third and fourth floors merited 
some degree of admonishment. The troops opened a hole in the 
wall using dynamite or a rocket and shot into the room with a 
machine gun, against rebels and hostages alike. The Attorney 
General's Office ruled against that specific line of action. 
That is why the attorney general sentenced Gen. Arias Cabrales. 
  Reporter: It was not because he followed orders 
from higher ranking civilian and military authorities, but for 
that specific incident? 
  Arrieta: I think the debate has wandered off in 
that direction. The orders he received are not in question. No 
one said that obeying orders frees you from all responsibility, 
as long as these orders are carried within the law. I cannot 
but agree with the justice minister, because I do not believe 
there was a specific and direct order to open fire with a 
machine gun into a room containing 60 or 70 people. That is the 
part that has created the controversy. There is a question of 
whether Gen. Arias Cabrales is in fact directly responsible for 
these specific acts and I have found no specific evidence in the 
file to prove that. This is why I am in no position to give you 
a specific answer to your question. I do believe it would be 
beneficial to offer the people a more detailed explanation about 
why the Attorney General's Office made this decision. 
  Reporter: Why has the president remained so 
silent. At the time he was a congressman and a spokesman for 
presidential candidate Virgilio Barco. He strongly criticized 
Former President Belisario Betancur, the minister of defense, 
and other high government officials for having issued the orders? 
  Arrieta: Dario, I cannot answer that question. 
  Reporter: Thank you, Attorney General Carlos 
Gustavo Arrieta, for accepting this interview for Caracol.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Apr (AFP) -- Colombian 
Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez admitted on Sunday that the 
sentences given to those who surrender to justice should be 
tougher, but he denied U.S. allegations that Colombia is a 
``narcodemocracy.'' 
  In an interview with Caracol Radio Network, Gonzalez denied 
assertions that the current Colombian legal system is a 
``narcocode.'' Just as the Attorney General's Office, the 
Prosecutor General's Office, and the Supreme Court have been 
saying, the minister admitted that the code requires immediate 
changes, especially regarding sentences given to drug 
traffickers. 
  Gonzalez insisted that despite the success of the policy to 
get drug traffickers to surrender, the law can still be 
improved. He said the code, contrary to what some groups are 
saying, does not grant automatic benefits to drug cartels and 
establishes discretionary mechanisms that allow authorities to 
impose strict sentences. 
  The minister said that the recent differences regarding 
sentences given to certain criminals arose because of problems 
in the way the sentences were applied and the interpretation of 
norms. The minister, however, refrained from identifying the 
reasons for the problems. He also described as unacceptable 
statements made by U.S. Senator John Kerry that Colombia is a 
``narcodemocracy'' and said that ``Colombia is a democracy that 
grows stronger each year, a democracy that has made huge 
sacrifices to fight organized crime, terrorism, and drugs.''

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 9 Apr (AFP) -- Drug trafficker 
Juan David Ochoa will have to serve 15 additional months in 
jail, with respect to his initial sentence, although he has also 
won a $100,000 reduction in his fine, the regional prosecutor's 
office in Antioquia Department, northeastern Colombia, reported 
on Saturday. Thus, the sentence of the eldest of the three Ochoa 
Clan brothers now stands at 93 months in jail (instead of 78), 
and he will pay, thanks to the reduction of his fine, $300,000 
(240 million pesos) instead of $400,000. 
  Juan David Ochoa, together with his brothers Jose Luis and 
Fabio, of the Medellin drug cartel, voluntarily surrendered to 
justice in 1991. The first sentence handed down against the 
confessed ``narco'' at the beginning of this year for collusion, 
illegal enrichment, and financing clandestine laboratories to 
process cocaine took into account his good conduct, work, and 
studies in prison. 
  The decision to increase his jail sentence and reduce his 
fine were negotiated under the surrender to justice policy that 
grants benefits to drug traffickers and paramilitaries who 
voluntarily surrender, confess to at least one crime, and agree 
to return money obtained through illegal means. According to 
unofficial reports, the former ``capo'' did not have the money 
to pay his fine and thus agreed to spend an additional 15 months 
in prison in exchange for a reduction of that fine. 
  It has also been reported that the sentence meted out to 
paramilitary Jose Otoniel Vanegas, who also surrendered 
voluntarily to authorities, was reduced to 15 years in prison 
for the murder of Conservative Party Senator Alfonso Ospina 
Ospina in 1988. The National Tribunal considered that his 
initial penalty--19 years--had been excessive and granted him a 
four-year reduction. 
  The measures against Ochoa and Vanegas were adopted within 
the framework of reversal hearings for the anticipated 
conclusion of their trials, which were carried out in the 
presence of the prisoners, their defense attorneys, Deputy 
Prosecutor General Jose Sintura, Attorney General's Office 
representatives, a prosecutor, and a regional judge.

  [Text] First Criminal Judge Luis Antonio Villeda today 
instructed Forensic Institute Director Dr. Juan Mateu Llort to 
refrain from making any statements on the death of U.S. adviser 
Julio Ramon Rivera, particularly regarding the toxicological 
test which showed the U.S. officer was on drugs. 
  With several journalists present, Llort said that, due to 
Villeda's orders, he could not make any remarks but that he 
``trusted God and the judge'' everything would come out right 
for the sake of the Forensic Institute's prestige. 
  The judge made this request ``so as not to hamper the 
investigations'' into the death of the officer, who was killed 
by the explosion of a hand grenade, the safety pin of which he 
pulled saying it was a toy grenade. The incident took place at 
the police station in Zacamil. Forensic Institute adviser 
Martin Santos has said: ``We abide by and obey our laws. We at 
the Forensic Institute will never be belittled by anyone. Our 
analyses are scientific and not biased in favor of anyone. For 
this reason, it will be the criminal judge who will decide who 
is telling the truth.'' Santos stressed the fact the order to 
keep silent originated with the judge, who surely knows why 
``the investigations should not be hampered.'' 
  U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan has told the Salvadoran news 
media the institute's tests were false and that Jose Maria 
Monterrey, National Civilian Police director, would report on 
the case today or tomorrow. 
  When the ambassador's position was announced, the press 
sought out Dr. Llort, but he replied he must refrain from 
reporting on the situation on the judge's instructions. It has 
been reported the judge will study the institute's tests and 
those carried out by the U.S. Government before making a 
statement. Llort finally said: The prestige and reliability of 
the institute's work has been released to the local news media. 
I trust God and the judge all will come out right. 
  The reporters appeared to have been taken by surprise this 
morning by the turn of events regarding Rivera's death, because 
Ambassador Flanigan himself has announced Police Director 
Monterrey would make a statement with additional details.

  [Text] The Haitian Anti-Drug Service announced that it 
seized 12 kg of cocaine intended for the U.S. market at the 
Port-au-Prince International Airport on 12 April. The drug was 
concealed in the luggage of a Haitian citizen who was going to 
Miami, Florida, on a commercial flight. He was arrested and 
imprisoned. Two other people, who were with the owner of the 
luggage, were questioned. 
  In recent days, more than 60 kg of cocaine coming from 
Colombia and intended for the U.S. market has been seized in 
Port-au-Prince by the Haitian Anti-Drug Service, which is 
working jointly with the local branch of the U.S. anti-drug 
office, Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA] [previous four words in

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the National Assembly created a 
Commission of Banking Operations that will prevent Nicaragua 
from becoming a haven for money-laundering by large drug 
cartels. The creation of this commission is discussed in 
Article 21 of the draft anti-drug bill on which debate continued 
yesterday in a full session of the legislature. 
  In the past two years, Nicaragua has been the victim of a 
strong assault by the drug cartels that want to overrun our 
territory, taking advantage of the current economic situation to 
institutionalize the laundering of drug money. 
  Article 23, which was approved yesterday, says, ``The 
commission's goal is to study the different techniques and 
methods used to carry out all banking, financial, or related 
operations that facilitate the legitimization of capital derived 
from illegal activities.'' 
  According to this bill, banks--private as well as 
state-owned--must report to the commission any deposit whose 
total amount surpasses $10,000 in operations conducted by any 
single client. 
  If a person or institution is being investigated for 
suspicion of money-laundering, the bill mandates that the 
individual is not entitled to any banking or fiscal secrecy 
whatsoever. Banks are obligated to reveal to the respective 
authorities all bank accounts of individuals being investigated 
in cases concerning drug-trafficking or the laundering of money 
or valuable objects. 
  The aforementioned commission will comprise a banking law 
specialist, an auditor, an expert in marketing, and a member of 
the National Police Commission on Economic Crimes. 
  The anti-drug bill moved closer to passage yesterday in the 
wake of a great deal of pressure being exerted by the police and 
the U.S. Embassy itself, as was disclosed by Congresswoman Doris 
Tijerino.

  [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino stated 
that 75 percent of the agreements signed by Panama on the 
subject of drug trafficking have not been ratified by the 
Legislative Assembly. 
  Mulino said that the Foreign Ministry has reached a series 
of 
agreements with various countries to combat drug trafficking and 
other related activities, such as money laundering, but that the 
assembly has shelved these initiatives. 
  According to the diplomat, Panama signed a Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with England last year, but the 
document has yet to be approved. 
  He emphasized that all efforts made with Colombia and other 
nations will be nullified if definite approval is not achieved 
during this period. He added that this would leave the country 
in arrears regarding means of cooperating to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  The foreign minister said that approximately 15 treaties are 
awaiting the Assembly's ratification or rejection, but that 
these need to be quickly implemented. 
  The U.S. Senate [as published] recently released a document 
asserting that Panama is one of the countries that have 
cooperated the least in the war against drug trafficking and 
money laundering. 
  However, the national government denies these accusations, 
arguing that it has enforced a series of norms to combat drug 
trafficking, including its adhering to the Vienna Convention and 
enforcing a decree that compels tourists to fill customs 
declarations for assets in excess of $10,000. 
  The Foreign Ministry is expected to send a formal protest 
note to the U.S. Government shortly.

  [Text] Ruben Dario Carles, Change '94 presidential 
candidate, said during an impromptu news conference in the lobby 
of the Europa Hotel yesterday that ``the U.S. Government has 
authorized drug trafficking and money laundering in Panama for 
some years now.'' He also said ``the charges against Panama are 
unfair.'' 
  Carles acknowledged ``money laundering is taking place in 
Panama more so now than during the past regime.'' 
  According to Carles ``this activity belittles the country's 
image throughout the world.'' According to Carles ``President 
Guillermo Endara's administration has ample means to defend 
itself from the attacks imposed by U.S. policies.'' 
  Carles said ``we Panamanians cannot accept the U.S. charges, 
but we must condemn the performance of certain court officials, 
judges, district attorneys, the Prosecutor's Office, and certain 
institutions responsible for curbing drug trafficking.'' 
  Regarding the discrediting of certain Panamanian 
organizations involved in the struggle against money laundering 
and drug trafficking, Carles said ``we must improve the 
tarnished image of official institutions by implementing 
measures aimed at ensuring officials' performance so as to 
prevent them from submitting to this illegal activity.''

  [Text] The National Assembly narcotics commission yesterday 
approved a draft law establishing stiffer penalties for drug 
related crimes and updating the type of activities considered to 
be money laundering. 
  The commission unanimously approved the draft and passed it 
on to the Assembly plenum for its second debate as an emergency 
bill. 
  The bill defines the strategy for fighting the production, 
consumption, and trafficking of drugs, money laundering, 
possession of goods and assets produced through drug 
trafficking, and related crimes. 
  The document is a combination of proposals presented by 
Legislator Leo Gonzalez and Acting Attorney General Jorge Ramon 
Valdes. It also includes recommendations made by the UN 
International Narcotics Convention held in 1988 in Vienna. 
  The draft improves the current description and adds several 
types of criminal activities to the list, including covert 
operations and controlled deliveries.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner 
stated on 12 April that our country does not have the resources 
to combat drug trafficking or other illegal activities. He 
indicated that this is why cooperation and help from the 
consumer countries is needed, and he proposed as a solution that 
``drug trafficking has to be fought where drugs are consumed.'' 
  Former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora said these same 
words when he received the U.S. demand that his country must 
fight the cultivation of coca leaf, which is the raw material 
from which cocaine is produced. 
  During the past few days our country has been involved in 
the 
trafficking of drugs or other illegal activities such as the 
Brazilian ``numbers game.'' When the foreign minister was asked 
what the government is doing to clear up the bad image that has 
been created, he said: ``I believe the government is doing 
everything it can to control drug trafficking and other illegal 
activities. We do not have sufficient resources to combat drug 
trafficking, and the help Paraguay receives from the consumer 
countries is not very much.'' 
  He indicated that the government cannot perform miracles 
without the necessary resources. He stated that our country has 
requested cooperation and help from the consumer countries, 
``because drug trafficking must be fought where the drugs are 
consumed. Because if there is consumption and an important 
price, then without a doubt there will be production and the 
possibility of [drug] routes.'' 
  He then proposed another solution to this scourge: that the 
consumer countries emphasize aiding the countries where the drug 
is produced or countries where drug routes are discovered.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Jara V.: ``Cocaine Riders Take Root in </F>
Paraguay''] 
  [Text] The seizure of 2 kilos of very pure cocaine by the 
antinarcotics police last week pales into insignificance when 
compared with the 60 small planes loaded with cocaine that 
depart daily from our territory for Brazil. 
  This comparison clearly establishes the great difference 
between the power of the police and that of the mafia 
organizations, which have taken root in our country, are a 
reality, and not even the police or the government can do 
anything against them. 
  It has been known for a long time--as prophesied by U.S. 
Embassy experts and even the police--that Paraguay is a point of 
transit for cocaine on its way to the great underground markets 
of the American continent and Europe. 
  It is known that there are clandestine airstrips in the 
hills 
of Amambay, Alto Parana, Canindeyu, and throughout the Chaco 
region. 
  The absence or insufficient action by the government has 
allowed the establishment in Paraguay of contacts for the 
Colombian and Bolivian mafia groups that make huge profits from 
cocaine. 
  This lack of action by the government, not just the current 
administration but also previous ones, has made Paraguay--in 
everybody's eyes--a great shelter for criminals and the center 
of large illegal negotiations. 
  The Brazilians now surprise us with concrete information 
that 
Colombian and Bolivian drug barons are using our territory to 
land, reload their illegal shipments, and calmly depart for the 
Brazilian markets. 
  At least 60 small planes depart from our country everyday, 
carrying cocaine to Brazil. This is alarming. 
  Is it possible that this number of flights could occur 
without the knowledge of our authorities--be they the police, 
the National Directorate for Civilian Aviation, or even the 
Armed Forces themselves? We doubt it. 
  The concrete issue of all this is that the lack of 
government 
action has allowed traffickers to definitively take root in our 
country, turning it into a drug corridor. The appropriate 
measures were not taken in time; but not because they were 
unaware of the problem.

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Carlos Podesta on 9 April 
announced that the government is going to investigate the local 
connection with an international network that deals in narcotics 
and arms trafficking and money laundering. He confirmed that 
``numbers game kingpin'' Miro Garcia had been seen several times 
in the casino in Ciudad del Este that belongs to Carlos Barreto 
Sarubbi. Podesta confirmed that Garcia is linked to ``the world 
of illegal gambling'' in the neighboring country. 
  ``They are things that have to be investigated, because one 
never knows whether it is simply media speculation or whether it 
goes beyond that, and in this case the government is going to 
investigate,'' the minister said, when asked about a published 
report regarding the discovery of an international network 
dealing in smuggling, narcotics and arms trafficking, and money 
laundering with connections in Ciudad del Este. ``This Garcia 
is known in the world of illegal gambling in Brazil,'' the 
minister confirmed. In the investigations Garcia appears to be 
seriously involved in being pinpointed as the ``numbers game 
kingpin.'' As is known, the ``animal lottery'' (a game) is 
banned in Brazil; it is similar to the numbers game played in 
our country, with the difference that the cards have pictures of 
animals instead of numbers. According to the Brazilian police, 
this game was implemented by the mafia, and it seems that it is 
a cover for other illegal activities such as the laundering of 
dollars, smuggling, and narcotics and weapons trafficking, among 
other things. 
  Podesta stated that he had information that Garcia is 
apparently involved in arms or drug trafficking. ``This is why 
I am waiting for my men (investigators) to tell me how they plan 
to coordinate and begin actions to clarify this charge,'' he 
promised. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] One of the front men for the Peruvian Cachique 
Rivera family, engaged in drug trafficking, was arrested on 2 
April in the capital after the Antidrug Division (Dinandro) 
exhaustively investigated an accounting office involved in 
``laundering'' money obtained from drug trafficking, according 
to Peruvian National Police [PNP] sources. 
  As is known, the Cachique Rivera brothers belong to one of 
the most important ``firms'' that supplies drugs to the 
Colombian Cali cartel. According to information obtained by 
Dinandro, they have become the drug trafficking leaders in Peru 
after the arrest of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, aka 
Vaticano. 
  The alleged owner of the ``enterprise,'' whose identity was 
not disclosed, was arrested when he was driving a luxurious 
metal blue Toyota Tercel vehicle, license number DO-3801, in a 
capital neighborhood. According to the source, Dinandro 
uncovered the front man after exhaustively and patiently 
investigating an accounting office in Lima. 
  Despite the secrecy in the case, it was leaked that 
Dinandro's Finance Division, with the technical support of 
auditors, established that the financial movements did not match 
the activities carried out by this ``front'' enterprise. 
  The source added that after checking the relationship 
between 
the arrested individual and the Cachique Rivera drug trafficking 
family, personnel from that ``enterprise'' were exhaustively 
investigated. 
  Dinandro thus carried out the successful operation on 2 
April 
when it was proved that the Cachique Rivera's front man was 
involved in laundering drug money. 
  It is known that Dinandro Chief General Walter Taboada Milla 
has ordered that investigations into the case continue. 
  Taboada said the Cachique Rivera gang is formed by four 
brothers from Tingo Maria--Abelardo, aka Teniente; Adolfo, aka 
Alferez; Segundo, aka Capitan; and Nicolas, aka Mayor. 
  According to the source, the Cachique Rivera family is 
headed 
by Abelardo, aka Teniente, the cruelest of the brothers, 
who--according to the police--heads the operations of the 
``firm'' from Colombia. Segundo, aka Capitan, is in charge of 
running the ``business'' in the jungle. The other two, 
according to the source, are in charge of collecting the money 
from drug trafficking. 
  Taboada said the arrest of these criminals is a matter of 
days. Peruvian and Colombian authorities are continuously 
exchanging information to find the ``narcos.'' 
  He ended by stating: ``We are following them closely. They 
are constantly going to Colombia. We hope to arrest them in a 
few days.'' 
  The sister in the Cachique Rivera family, Margarita, 30, was 
arrested on 20 March in Lima on an arrest warrant issued by the 
Lima court on charges of drug trafficking. [passage omitted]

  [Text] General Nicolas Hermoza Rios, the Armed Forces Joint 
Commander and Army Commander, has said that more than 100 Army 
personnel have been sentenced so far for their involvement in 
drug trafficking. 
  Gen. Hermoza said Army personnel who commit crimes while on 
duty and who allegedly protect traffickers are immediately 
discharged and taken to a military court. 
  He said: ``In my opinion the Military Court can best 
investigate these cases. If suspects were brought before a 
civilian court today, I am sure many guilty criminals would be 
released tomorrow.'' 
  Hermoza Rios said that only when an Army member is caught 
red-handed with irrefutable evidence and witnesses to link him 
to this kind of crime, is he then taken to a civilian court. 
  Following an operation in the Satipo Military Base, Gen. 
Hermoza spoke to the program ``Dialogue'' transmitted on Channel 
Two. He said that in the past few weeks traffickers had 
suffered harsh blows. 
  ``We are all witnesses of the accomplishments of the forces 
of order during operations that took place in Madre de Dios, 
Inapari, Manu, and now in Satipo, in which important trafficking 
networks were dismantled,'' he said. 
  He said the operations carried out in these remote parts of 
the country follow a strategy ordered by President Alberto 
Fujimori to eradicate drug trafficking. 
  He added that terrorism is about to disappear in the 
Huallaga 
Valley. It is expected that the military front in the zone will 
eradicate the Shining Path at the same time it ends trafficking. 
  ``These actions have forced the traffickers to move to other 
drug production and storage centers like Madre de Dios and 
Satipo where clandestine airstrips for the departure of 
airplanes that carry drugs have been found,'' he said. 
  Gen. Hermoza said he is not worried with the investigations 
and criticisms by some media about the struggle against 
traffickers. 
  He said there is a campaign to discredit ``the Armed 
Forces'' 
through unfounded attacks. 
  ``These attacks are not isolated but are made within the 
framework of a campaign to discredit our Armed Forces and to 
destabilize the democratic process in Peru,'' he said. 
  Gen. Hermoza said the media will never be censored because 
freedom of press and expression are the main bastions of 
democracy. 
  Gen. Hermoza likewise ruled out disagreements between the 
Armed Forces and the National Police, saying that their drug 
enforcement task is being carried out in total harmony and 
coordination. 
  He said that at every military intervention against 
traffickers a prosecutor and a police representative are present 
adding that the drugs confiscated during the operation are 
handed to them. 
  ``There is close cooperation at all levels. It is good to 
see that unity and discipline are being maintained despite the 
difficult conditions in which we are carrying out this 
struggle,'' he added. 
  He added that the successful anti-trafficking policy in Peru 
is not based on support provided by the DEA but to an 
appropriate strategy developed by the government through the 
national Armed Forces. 
  ``Nowhere in the world has a problem like trafficking and 
terrorism been combated with so much success as it is currently 
being done in Peru,'' he said. 
  He recalled that in November last year the Armed Forces 
Joint 
Command correctly evaluated the government provisions to 
eradicate terrorism from the country and to consolidate national 
pacification according to the law. 
  He denied that these actions seek to improve the Armed 
Forces 
image in face of the serious charges against some of its members 
for being involved with drug trafficking. He said the Armed 
Forces began to participate in the struggle against trafficking 
and terrorism when the work exceeded the capability of the 
police force. 
  ``These social scourges represented at a given moment an 
imminent risk and danger to national security and the survival 
of our nation, which is why urgent measures had to be adopted,'' 
he said. 
  Gen. Hermoza said the legal framework established by the 
current regime has allowed the Armed Forces and the National 
Police to carry out their task appropriately in the most 
troubled zones of the country.

  [Text] The creation of the National System for the Control 
and Repression of Drug Production and Drug Trafficking [Sistema 
Nacional de Control y Represion de la Produccion y el Trafico 
Ilicito de Drogas] is the most important contribution 
encompassed in the national antidrug plan drafted by a 
commission of experts at the government's request. 
  According to the draft, this new drug control system will 
group all the many dispersed antidrug government actions which 
need to be centralized and organized. 
  The new Peruvian Government antidrug policy organization 
will 
fulfill functions similar to the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, which drafts, centralizes, and implements the U.S. 
Government's antidrug strategy under the leadership of Drug Czar 
Lee Brown. 
  The influence of the U.S. model does not stop there, because 
the National Drug Control and Drug Prevention Plan [Plan 
Nacional de Prevencion y Control de Drogas]--which is already in 
President Alberto Fujimori's hands for study and approval--is a 
Peruvian version of U.S. goals, objectives, plans, and programs 
in this area. 
  The Peruvian program encompasses drug production and drug 
trafficking; alternative development programs; and drug 
prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. 
  The plans call for the national system to be divided into 
four subsystems, each of which will concentrate their efforts on 
drug control and drug repression activities in the battle 
against drugs; the deviation of chemical precursors and inputs; 
the transfer of funds and laundered money; drug production and 
drug trafficking; and the smuggling of arms and explosives. 
  These subsystems will be subordinated to the central 
organization, which will be in charge of the planning, 
coordinating, controlling, and information and decisionmaking 
process of the antidrug efforts to be undertaken by the Peruvian 
Government from 1994 to the year 2000. 
  In addition to creating this arm for the antidrug struggle, 
the plan has 20 other objectives, among which are the 
development of the alternative development program, the 
monitoring of coca crops, the safeguarding of the environment, 
and the development of research programs for the beneficial use 
of coca. 
  The main objectives are centered on the gradual reduction of 
coca crops, the repression of drug production and drug 
trafficking, and the decrease of drug use. 
  By the year 2000 the goal of this ambitious project is to 
incorporate through the alternative development programs at 
least 50 percent of the peasant population currently involved in 
coca production for illegal purposes in legal farming activities. 
  In addition to alternative development, the plan proposes a 
strategy based on the establishment of legal and institutional 
order. 
  According to the draft, during the 1994-2000 period the 
promotion of the alternative development program will be granted 
``top priority'' with the objective of achieving the reduction 
of coca crops used for illegal purposes. 
  The national antidrug plan, the first of its kind in our 
country, was drafted by a multisectorial commission headed by 
General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez, Peruvian representative to the 
OAS Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug 
Abuse (CICAD). 
  The commission was established in November, and is made up 
of 
representatives from government ministries, with support from 
the United Nations International Drug Control Program [Programa 
de las Naciones Unidas para la Fiscalizacion Internacional de 
Drogas] (PNUFID) and prominent experts on the matter.

  [Text] Since February 1978, when the government promulgated 
the first national antinarcotics law, the antinarcotics struggle 
in the country has been characterized by its isolated efforts 
and meager results. 
  At the end of the 1970's, farmed coca production did not 
surpass 30,000 hectares. Last year it surpassed 150,000 
hectares according to the Ofecod [Executive Office for Drug 
Control], which is under the jurisdiction of the Interior 
Ministry. Some less conservative statistics suggest the total 
is about 300,000 hectares. 
  U.S. sources have stated that during the period 1978 to 
1993, 
drug trafficking activities which were previously concentrated 
in the Upper Huallaga Valley expanded at the national level. 
Some 200,000 families now farm coca and manufacture cocaine 
paste. Drug-related activities generate an income of about $2 
billion per year within the Peruvian economy. 
  Many experts believe the failure of the antidrug struggle 
follows the lack of an antidrug strategy and the absence of an 
organization to plan, coordinate and implement it. 
  The national drug prevention and drug control plan seeks to 
resolve one of the most vulnerable points of the antidrug 
struggle in the country by establishing an organization to 
centralize all government efforts in this field. 
  The General Law on Drugs foresaw in 1978 the need to 
establish an organization to draft a drug control policy, to 
implement it and to coordinate all the actions to be developed. 
  Law No. 22095 established the Multi-Sectorial Drug Control 
Committee (Comucod) [Comite Multisectorial de Control de 
Drogas], an organization to approve the government's antidrug 
policy; and the Ofecod, an executive and coordinating 
organization. Under the law, Comucod was to comprise six 
cabinet members and an alternate from the Supreme Court. The 
truth is that Comucod did not fulfill the duties with which it 
was entrusted by law and never really worked. 
  Ofecod came under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. 
It was to have controlled drugs, and implemented and 
coordinated government actions. As it turned out, Ofecod 
handled administrative functions of disposing of the goods 
seized by the police during antidrug operations and ignored the 
other duties with which it was entrusted by law. 
  Experts believe neither of these organizations completely 
fulfilled its duties. This, undoubtedly, directly influenced 
the expansion of coca farming and trafficking at the national 
level. 
  The lack of leadership, and the dilution and ineffectiveness 
of government actions in the antidrug struggle, became obvious 
in the early 1980's. 
  The main institutions involved in the drug control program 
at 
the time were: the National Coca Enterprise, (Enaco); the Upper 
Huallaga Coca Control and Reduction Agency (Corah); and the 
Upper Huallaga Development Program (Peah). 
  Enaco was the government organization responsible for the 
monopoly, legal marketing, and industrialization of coca. In 
fact, it only captured an insignificant part of Peru's coca 
harvest which was mainly being grown for drug traffickers. 
  Corah, which was entrusted with coca eradication programs in 
the area, eliminated several hundred thousand hectares of coca 
in the Upper Huallaga region but paradoxically the valley became 
the main coca producing region in the world. 
  Peah, which was responsible for promoting alternative 
farming 
programs in coca producing regions, yielded insufficient results 
and enjoyed little support among coca farmers. 
  Some experts said the failure of these government 
organizations to control coca farming and trafficking lies in 
the fact that trafficking is merely considered a criminal 
activity that must be disciplined with police repression and 
severe legal punishments. 
  For a long time the antinarcotics struggle was only based on 
repressive actions. The police were the main organization 
entrusted with conducting these repressive actions through its 
diverse specialized units--among them the Mobile Rural Patrol 
Unit (Umopar), which was involved in the compulsory eradication 
of thousands of hectares of coca; the former Drug Police 
Division (Dipog); the Illicit Drug Traffic Investigative 
Division (Dintid); the Antidrug Division (Dirandro), which later 
became the Antidrug Division (Dinandro). 
  Even today repressive actions are still prevalent. The 
number of actions has risen since July 1992 when the government 
established the Internal Operations Front Command (COFI) which 
falls under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces. This is the 
top organization, responsible for the planning, implementation, 
and control of the struggle against drugs and terrorism. 
  In the last few years, in addition to repression, the 
authorities have introduced the strategy of alternative 
development. This program seeks to replace economies based on 
coca farming with the alternative farming of legal crops and an 
improvement in the standard of life in coca-producing regions. 
  The Peruvian Government has acknowledged the prevalence of 
the economic and social problems that encourage trafficking. It 
paid particular attention to alternative farming but its results 
in practice have been almost nil. Neither the Institute for 
Alternative Development (Idea), nor the Autonomous Authority for 
Alternative Development (Aada) were ever implemented. 
Considering the antidrug draft bill grants ``the highest 
priority'' to the alternative development program, there are 
great expectations that this time around, this program will 
finally be implemented.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Alfredo Rodriguez, chief of the </F>
Huallaga Countersubversive Front Command, by Braulio Orellana 
Flores; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Orellana: Gen. Rodriguez, how is the 
pacification process developing in the Huallaga 
Countersubversive Front under your command? 
  Rodriguez: Regarding the pacification process, we 
can say that it is 90 percent under control in the northern 
region (San Martin). This means that the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] and Shining Path [SL] have been almost 
totally annihilated. In the southern region (mainly in Tingo 
Maria) we are still facing problems with subversion because the 
last subversive groups persist in their genocidal venture and 
have not surrendered to authorities. However, I can inform you 
that the entire area will be completely under control very soon. 
  Orellana: The legal measures issued by the 
government, such as the Repentance Law, have yielded excellent 
results in other regions. What was the impact of this 
legislation on the antiterrorism struggle? 
  Rodriguez: Look, initially these measures were 
received with some mistrust in the region. People did not 
believe they would result in anything positive. It was thought 
that the measures' objective was to pressure people. Time has 
gone by and these people, I cannot say to what sector they 
belong, have realized how mistaken they were. There have been 
many terrorists who have voluntarily resorted to the Repentance 
Law without any sort of pressure. 
  When these terrorists presented themselves to the Armed 
Forces barracks and units their human rights were respected, and 
this attitude also has influenced subversives to resort to this 
new law. 
  Orellana: What other factors have yielded positive 
results in the counterterrorist struggle in the Huallaga Front? 
  Rodriguez: In addition to the Armed Forces' 
actions and the legal measures, we can say that citizen 
participation has been another fundamental element in winning 
the war against terrorism. Their cooperation has been valuable 
in the last few years. 
  In addition, the Armed Forces are actively participating in 
this effort and we are constantly engaged in clashes with 
terrorist groups with very positive results. 
  Finally, I must say that psychological operations are also 
an 
essential part of the war we are currently waging against the SL 
and MRTA. In the jungle area, we drop pamphlets from our 
airplanes telling terrorists, who have been recruited by 
force,xbout the serious mistake they are making by staying with 
the terrorists. Many already have abandoned these shelters and 
surrendered under the Repentance Law. 
  Orellana: In the Huallaga Front, there have been 
some cases of the involvement of military officers with drug 
traffickers. What can you tells us in this regard? 
  Rodriguez: We have sustained harsh blows from 
these bad elements of society who have seriously damaged our 
institution. The Peruvian Army will never allow its members to 
be involved in this illegal activity. 
  However, we bear the full responsibility and we fully trust 
that this situation will end there. Corruption is not part of 
the Armed Forces' institutions. 
  Orellana: How are you combating drug trafficking 
in the Huallaga Front under your command? 
  Rodriguez: At the present time, our units, our 
commands, and the Huallaga Front commander himself are directly 
involved in fighting drug trafficking. 
  We are constantly destroying airfields and the shelters the 
drug traffickers build in the more remote jungle areas. We 
conduct dragnet operations whenever we have specific information 
to capture the ``drug traffickers'' and this is yielding very 
good results. 
  Orellana: This, of course, is forcing drug 
traffickers to withdraw to other areas where they are also under 
attack. 
  Rodriguez: Quite so. We are destroying all 
illegal activity in this area. This is why drug traffickers are 
withdrawing to other areas, where they are being attacked in the 
same manner. They will have no way out when we control the 
entire region. 
  We witnessed this when we seized three metric tons of 
cocaine 
paste some time ago in Manu. We have had access to this 
information since January. This is very important for us 
because very soon we will eradicate them from the entire San 
Martin region, although not entirely. 
  Orellana: General, how has the respect for human 
rights developed in the pacification process? 
  Rodriguez: We uphold human rights in every aspect 
of the word. There are no human rights abuses in this area. If 
there have been charges in this regard, they have been from 
biased parties uninterested in seeing the Armed Forces working 
in the region. 
  I will give you one example: When we entered Bellavista 
within the framework of a military operation that upheld all the 
laws in force and that even appointed a special prosecutor, 
there were people who reported that the alleged terrorists we 
arrested had been allegedly mistreated. All these fabrications 
were later denied by the special prosecutor who accompanied the 
military operation. 
  Orellana: Does this mean there is no evidence of 
the alleged human rights violations charges that have been 
raised? 
  Rodriguez: No there are not. None of the charges 
raised against the Armed Forces' activities in the area have 
been proven. Perhaps some may have been very aggressive but this 
does not mean that people have deliberately committed abuses 
against those arrested in Huallaga.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Tomas Marky, chief of the Ayacucho </F>
Political-Military Command, by correspondent Abilio Arroyo; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Arroyo: After 14 years, what is the 
situation of subversion in Ayacucho where the fighting began? 
  Marky: It has been reduced considerably. I 
believe the reason for this success--in addition to the capture 
of [Shining Path, SL, leader] Abimael Guzman--is basically the 
union between the population and the police. This is why our 
first objective was to gain and keep the support of the 
population without which it would have been impossible to defeat 
the SL. The people are currently cooperating with us and the 
51st Los Cabitos Garrison now has a different image. This was 
possible thanks to our road development and civic action program. 
  Arroyo: What role do the peasant defense patrols 
and self-defense committees play in the antisubversive struggle? 
  Marky: The peasant defense patrols have helped 
tremendously in the pacification program. I would say that this 
is one of the factors that caused the SL to crash. About 60 
percent of the rural population is organized in patrols. 
  Arroyo: There are, however, many accusations of 
abuse by the defense patrols which sometimes involve the 
security forces. What measures have you taken? 
  Marky: There are isolated cases of abuse. As you 
can understand, Ayacucho Department is large and it is not 
possible to guarantee adequate action. We learn about the 
abuses from our patrols which are permanently covering the zone. 
If there is a serious mistake, we immediately report it to the 
court. This is why some peasant defense patrol members are 
under arrest. Abuses happen within the context of a war and are 
comprehensible but they are not part of the antisubversive 
policy. It is like in any institution, if someone commits a 
crime he is reported to justice and punished. 
  Arroyo: How many of the settlements that were 
abandoned are coming back with life in Ayacucho? 
  Marky: There are 30 settlements. The newest are 
Nununhuaycco, Umaru, Marccaraccay, and all the settlements in 
Uchuraccay. We give them security with a military patrol. 
These settlements are taking great steps to return to 
tranquility and going back to agriculture gradually. There is 
also a food program from the Pronaa [National Food Assistance 
Program] and the PAR [Rapid Assistance Post] which are creating 
the basic conditions for the people to live in a dignified 
manner in their communities. This means reconstruction of 
houses, medical posts, and schools. This is important because 
in the past the people returned to their communities in a 
disorganized manner. Perhaps not everyone will return to the 
communities, especially the youth who have already adjusted to 
city life. Many people long to return to their land and prefer 
their community instead of promiscuity and poverty far from 
their home. We help with the transportation and every other way 
we can. 
  Arroyo: When did the strategy in Ayacucho change? 
  Marky: Last year. It was realized that it was 
necessary to stop giving priority to repression and to 
concentrate on development. We took advantage of the legal 
framework of Law 24150 and Legislative Decree 749 which modified 
Article 5 of this law regarding the rights of the 
Political-Military Commands. [passage omitted] 
  Arroyo: Is it true that the Apurimac valley is the 
second Huallaga due to the ``cocalization'' of the zone and the 
increased drug trafficking? 
  Marky: Denying that would be like trying to cover 
the sun with a finger. These people have no good roads and the 
prices of coffee and cocoa are very low. There is not much 
incentive to grow those products, so many people are now growing 
coca. We do not repress coca growing because the Enaco 
[National Coca Enterprise] is in the area and there are many 
legal coca growers. But we are not naive, part of that 
production is used for drugs. 
  As the zone is wide and long, we would need many people to 
fight it. We are doing it but we need specialized personnel, 
perhaps a police base like the one in Santa Lucia to give us 
greater logistical support with radar in this struggle. I have 
information on the clandestine airfields in the zone but we have 
no means to control them. If we go to one place to fight 
trafficking, these people with their resources will move their 
illegal trafficking. This is why it is urgent to promote 
alternative development instead of repressive measures. 
  Arroyo: How do you evaluate the subversion in that 
zone? 
  Marky: That question will allow me to clarify a 
statement on a television program that the red flag was flying 
over the Apurimac River valley. That is not true. I know that 
zone and I can assure you that the SL was eradicated from there. 
The latest subversive outbreaks occurred in Viscatan where we 
intervened to evict the subversives. We fired on them with 
gunships, our military patrols captured many subversives and 
seized an important arsenal. We have information that the 
subversives are returning through the Sello de Oro zone but we 
will pounce at any moment. 
  Arroyo: And in other zones of Ayacucho? 
  Marky: Very little, we know of the presence of a 
few subversives in the zone of Rasuhuillca, Huanta, but we are 
permanently patrolling that area. With the information provided 
by the subversives who repented, we have discovered several SL 
hideouts which prompted the subversives to migrate to other 
regions. 
  Arroyo: How many SL members do you estimate are 
operating in Ayacucho? 
  Marky: I cannot say, but there are only a few. 
Their internal struggles have lead to murder. One SL leader 
was murdered a month and a half ago. We were surprised because 
it involved Engineer Chocce, the departmental director of the 
Transportation and Communications Ministry. The police found in 
his house several letters of obedience to ``President Gonzalo'' 
and other letters recriminating him for the lack of action in 
Ayacucho. 
  Arroyo: Did you know him? 
  Marky: Yes. We suspected he was a terrorist 
because a repented terrorist reported him. After a police 
interrogation, and as no concrete evidence linking him with 
subversion was found, he was released and resumed his work as an 
important Transportation and Communications Ministry official. 
He held meetings with everybody, including us, and kept a close 
watch of the work in his sector. Then one day he was found dead 
on the slope of the Acuchimay with a SL sign saying: ``This how 
the traitors of the party die.'' 
  Arroyo: Did he participate in the SL Committee 
meetings? 
  Marky: Never, he was a low ranking official at a 
regional level. He did, however, participate in official 
meetings. This case has helped us adjust and improve our 
intelligence service, making it more selective and much more 
accurate, to identify terrorists and their aides who have 
infiltrated public institutions. 
  Arroyo: Does this mean there are terrorists in the 
city? 
  Marky: Very few. They have repented and want 
nothing to do with the SL column that continues to perpetrate 
terrorist actions. Proof of this is that since last year there 
have been no actions such as the feared ``armed strikes'' in the 
city. In the education field, there might be some cases of 
indoctrination, but we are detecting them gradually. We believe 
some teachers were recruited through fear. They have now 
changed now and want peace. Not long ago members of the SUTE 
[Trade Union of Education Workers] of Huamanga requested 
permission to hold a rally and I granted it. They held their 
rally peacefully.

  [Text] The government policy in the struggle against 
illegal drug trafficking has allowed the Armed Forces and the 
National Police, which are operating under a single command, to 
seize 28,782 kg of drugs such as cocaine base, cocaine 
hydrochloride, and marijuana in a little more than three years. 
During that period these forces captured 12,975 drug traffickers 
and confiscated 415,000 kg of precursors used by the mafia 
``firms'' to make drugs. 
  According to Executive Agency for Drug Control (Ofecod) 
statistics, 3,108 drug addicts were arrested nationwide in 1993. 
  Ofecod also reported that in 1991, drug seizures reached 
5,859 kg. In 1992 the amount was 8,800 kg, which included 8,341 
kg of cocaine base, 231.402 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 
227.038 kg of marijuana. 
  In 1993, antidrug operations seized 9,461.511 kg of drugs, 
including 8,586.757 kg of cocaine base, 436.727 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride, and 437.762 kg of marijuana. 
  From January to 24 March 1994, drug seizures reached 
4,532.675 kg of cocaine base, 18.832 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride, and 110.051 kg of marijuana. 
  The number of drug traffickers arrested in 1991 was 3,664, 
4,195 in 1992, and 5,022 in 1993. In the first three months of 
this year, 94 drug traffickers were arrested. 
  The police operations also allowed the seizure of 105,527 kg 
of precursors in 1991, 185,895 kg in 1992, and 90,288 kg in 
1993, and 33,323 kg in the first three months of this year. 
  According to estimates by the Interior Ministry and the 
Dinandro [National Antidrug Division], the antidrug forces 
confiscated properties, furniture, equipment, and money worth 
about $51.65 million from the ``firms'' in 1993. 
  The goods include 41 properties in Lima and the provinces 
and 
115 vehicles including cars, trucks, small airplanes, 
speedboats, and motorcycles. 
  Dinandro also reported that 1993 operations against drug 
traffickers in the Upper Huallaga led to the destruction of 41 
labs for processing drugs and 28 maceration pits. 
  From 1 January to 10 March 1994, the police destroyed 12 
labs 
and 11 maceration pits for making cocaine base. It should be 
pointed out that the largest amount of maceration pits, 315, 
were destroyed in 1992.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- It was disclosed today that a 
high-ranking Peruvian Army chief has been accused of heading a 
military organization that protected drug traffickers in 
exchange for money. 
  General Eduardo Bellido, current Peruvian military attache 
in 
Israel, was charged by retired Major Evaristo Castillo with 
letting drug traffickers operate in Huallaga, where he was 
political-military commander during 1991 and 1992. 
  Castillo, who said he has been harassed and received death 
threats, asserted that in 1992 Bellido ordered his troops not to 
intervene in the struggle against drug trafficking and that they 
only fought terrorism. 
  The retired Army major stated that the alleged links 
Peruvian 
military officers maintained with the drug mafias ``are a 
complete system'' and that it is not only isolated cases of 
corruption involving certain officers. 
  He thus disagreed with a recent U.S. State Department report 
stating that one of the obstacles facing the fight against drug 
trafficking in Peru is the corruption of police and military 
officers, but that the problem does not have an institutional 
character. 
  Castillo stated that in 1992 he witnessed how chiefs of 
battalions under Bellido's command collected protection fees 
from drug traffickers to let them operate and then handed that 
money over to Bellido. 
  As an example he mentioned that the general never ordered 
the 
arrest of the most important Peruvian drug trafficker, Demetrio 
Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, arrested last February in 
Colombia, ``although he knew where he was through Intelligence 
Service and DEA reports.'' 
  He also asserted that the Peruvian military also knows where 
Colombian trafficker Waldo Vargas, aka Ministro, operates and is 
not doing anything to arrest him.

  [Text] Respect for the human rights of those arrested on 
drug trafficking charges in the Upper Huallaga zone is no longer 
a cold guideline given by the military and police commands. It 
is now a conscientious action taken by all members of the Army 
and the National Police operating in that part of the Peruvian 
jungle. 
  On 2 April in San Martin, an inhospitable area in the 
Tarapoto jungle, a Dinandro [National Antidrug Division] patrol 
supported by the Air Police detected a lab for processing 
cocaine base and acted by surprise. Not even the torrential rain 
or the thunderstorm stopped police, who arrested five people. 
  After the operation, police seized 128 kg of cocaine base, 
many ingredients for making the drug, and a shotgun. 
  Back at the Tarapoto airport the arrested were taken to the 
police station. The police then, without knowing reporters were 
present, gave the arrested soft drinks and their own food 
rations they used in their operations. 
  None of the arrested showed signs of violence on their 
bodies 
when they were put under the jurisdiction of judicial officials. 
They also never complained about being mistreated by police. 
  A police sergeant said: ``We always respect the rights of 
the 
people we arrest, even under the most adverse circumstances 
after they use their weapons on us and we capture them.'' 
  This National Police action, without the tempting presence 
of 
cameras and microphones, shows that human rights are indeed 
respected in Peru and that there is no need for ``spokesmen'' 
abroad to report alleged human right violations. The real 
situation is in that remote region where perhaps one of those 
``spokesmen'' never saw what happened.

  [Text] Puerto Maldonado -- Since mid-1993, Peruvian and 
foreign drug traffickers have chosen Puerto Maldonado as the 
shipping center and exit point for drugs produced in Peru in 
their attempt to dodge the cordon established by the security 
forces in the traditional cocaine production areas. 
  This was proved by three operations carried out by the armed 
and police forces during the past five weeks, during which the 
largest amounts of drugs were seized. 
  A total of 3.5 metric tons of washed cocaine base paste were 
seized on 26 February at Boca Manu airport and more than 1 
metric ton of cocaine base paste on 24 and 26 March at an 
airstrip in Inapari, capital of Tahuamani Province. 
  In every case the cocaine was ready to be loaded on an 
aircraft bound for Colombia, where it was going to be made into 
cocaine hydrochloride that would then be sold in the United 
States and Europe. 
  It was disclosed that the drugs seized in Boca Manu belonged 
to the ``Cachique Rivera firm'' and that Colombians were 
involved. 
  It also was disclosed that the drugs seized during the two 
latest operations at Inapari airstrip and the Santa Rosa de 
Fatima farm (15 km from the Shirimayoc checkpoint on the 
Brazilian border) allowed the breaking up of another ``firm'' 
that supplied drugs to an organization of Colombian drug 
traffickers headed by an individual identified as ``Guido 
Correa.'' 
  PNP [Peruvian National Police] General Sixto Gutierrez, head 
of the PNP 10th Region, told an EL COMERCIO correspondent that 
``Guido Correa'' lives in Cauca Valley (Colombia), from where he 
directs his organization. 
  In view of the harassment by security forces in Upper 
Huallaga, Ucayali, and Ayacucho (where his aircraft used to land 
to load drugs), he decided to find another place for his 
shipments. 
  For this reason he sent to Peru six members of his 
organization identified as ``Andres,'' ``Dario,'' ``Tarzan,'' 
``Bebito,'' ``Lazo,'' and ``Cucaracha,'' who clandestinely 
entered the country between 14 and 15 March through the 
``Palestina Peru'' area on the border of La Convencion (Cuzco) 
and Ayacucho. They were received there by Peruvian citizen 
``Caliche,'' with whom they made their first contacts. 
  From there they decided to send to Inapari Colombians Miguel 
Manosalva Contreras, 26, Ruben Dario Arango Santa, 35, and 
Andres Ramirez Piedraita, 32, as well as Brazilian Alsimar 
Marquez Da Silva, to buy drugs. 
  Once in Inapari they contacted ``Fernando,'' who is the 
organization's coordinator and, with ``Piston,'' the main drug 
supplier. 
  Thus they managed to gather an initial amount of 400 kg of 
cocaine base paste, which they shipped to Colombia on 20 March. 
Since they saw that there seemed to be no problems they decided 
to continue operating in Inapari and, what is more, built an 
airstrip on the Santa Rosa de Fatima farm. 
  The Army and the PNP, however, thanks to intelligence work, 
found out about this new organization and carried out an 
operation that allowed them to seize more than 1 metric ton of 
cocaine base paste and arrest 23 drug traffickers. Two 
policemen also are being investigated.

  [Text] EL PERUANO was able to establish that the struggle 
against drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga could be more 
effective if the helicopters the Air Police use in the thick 
jungle areas were equipped to fly at night. 
  This is because of the new tactic used by Colombian drug 
traffickers who land their modern aircraft at night, taking 
advantage of the fact that police aircraft do not have night 
vision devices to detect them and react immediately. 
  An Air Police member commented: ``When we started our 
antinarcotic operations in the Upper Huallaga we struck hard 
blows against drug trafficking but all these operations were 
carried out in the daytime. Now the Colombian traffickers carry 
out their operations at night, which complicates matters for 
us.'' 
  In addition to limited operational capacity are the 
helicopters' years of service. In the 60's, the UH-1 
helicopters played an important role in the Vietnam war due to 
their great maneuverability and their capacity to escape unhurt 
from the most incredible war situations. 
  However, 30 years later, it can be said that the UH-1 
helicopters have completed their operational cycle. Therefore, 
those operating in the Upper Huallaga must be replaced. 
Accidents have occurred, but the Peruvian police pilots' skill 
has prevented greater disgraces. 
  Another member of the force said: ``We need training to 
operate at night with night vision devices because this would 
make our work more effective. If we had this our actions would 
certainly seriously wound this illegal trade.'' 
  This policeman has every right to say what he said because 
the information supplied by the silent DEA aircraft, which 
operates with its turbines off in the middle of the night in the 
jungle, cannot be used by the Peruvian pilots because their 
aircraft only fly during the day. 
  Although this has by no means affected police pilots' 
morale, 
neither can it be said that their effectiveness is minimal. 
Facts prove it: The results would be much more significant if 
only they were to operate under other conditions.

  [Text] The farmers in the northern Upper Huallaga (San 
Martin Department) who left that region after the brutal attacks 
by the Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] are gradually but with determination returning to 
their land. The people living in that region agree that what is 
taking place now in that part of the country is the best result 
of the pacification policy. 
  When subversion entered the Upper Huallaga region a few 
years 
ago--about the mid-1980's--mainly in some provinces of San 
Martin Department, thousands of farmers and peasants had to 
leave their farms or land to settle in the nearby cities or, in 
the worst cases, to settle in the capital. 
  Subversion now has been practically eliminated and the 
people 
have returned, not with the intention of continuing to grow 
coca, which is the raw material for the sinister narco-terrorist 
alliance, but to grow other types of products that are more 
profitable and can be exported. 
  For example, in 1992 rice growing in Tarapoto reached 12,000 
hectares and so far this year the cultivation of this product 
has already reached 30,000 hectares. It is expected that 50,000 
hectares of rice will be grown by the end of this year. 
  The situation of the corn crop is also the same. Although 
the 
quality of corn is not the best, efforts are being made to 
improve it to the exportable type required by the important and 
demanding world markets. 
  But despite this limitation, Tarapoto's corn is wanted by 
countries like Germany, which wants to buy 80,000 metric tons 
even though this year's production is only expected to reach 
20,000 metric tons. 
  This is why agricultural land is being prepared in order to 
increase corn production considerably next year. 
  General Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros, general commander of the 
Huallaga Front, said: ``The farmers welcome the intentions of 
foreign importers.'' 
  Regarding fruits, grape production is giving good 
results--it 
is being used for making wine and marmalade and sales are good. 
  A Peruvian farmer said: ``In Cumbaza we have rich land with 
good production. Although the grape harvest is only once a year, 
we have two harvests here.'' 
  Gen. Rodriguez said: ``We are gradually making progress in 
replacing coca, and the price of coca has dropped considerably 
in all of San Martin Department.'' 
  As an effective complement to this situation in the northern 
Upper Huallaga, antidrug operations are eradicating cocaine base 
although not definitively. 
  The work by the Air Police Directorate providing air support 
to National Antidrug Division (Dinandro) patrols, and sometimes 
to the Army, is ``suffocating'' the drug traffickers still 
operating in the region. 
  An Air Police Directorate officer said: ``Ninety percent of 
the antidrug operations are carried out through the use of 
helicopters, and our unit is the only that can carry out this 
type of operation.'' 
  Although the people who live in the areas where drug 
traffickers operate protected by the wild jungle of San Martin 
reject the police action because the people in some way also 
live off this activity, the ``blows'' have been hard and more 
drug traffickers had to leave for other regions, where a 
struggle also is being carried out against them. 
  An Air Police pilot said: ``We carried out several 
interdiction operations in the last few weeks; an area is hit 
after confidential information is received. We seized precursors 
and drugs, and many people involved in this activity were 
arrested.'' 
  The struggle against drug trafficking probably will take 
some 
time but much less than the struggle against terrorism. But the 
police operating in the area need more sophisticated equipment 
to face this social scourge in a more effective manner.

  [Text] Montevideo, 18 Apr (EFE) -- Uruguayan Interior 
Minister Raul Iturria today stressed that there is no evidence 
that this country is being used by international drug 
traffickers for the ``laundering'' of money, thus denying a 
recent UN report. 
  ``There is no evidence that supports that report. This 
already has been denied by the Uruguayan Foreign Ministry and 
our intelligence services,'' the minister emphasized. 
  ``There may be people who invest money that has come from 
not 
very ethical sources, but this does not allow for such a 
vehement assertion that Uruguay is a market where money is 
`laundered,''' Iturria stressed. 
  ``Ours is a country that was open to the entry of persons 
and 
capital long before drug trafficking with its current dimensions 
existed,'' the interior minister said in remarks to the 
Montevideo media. 
  Iturria indicated that during the past few months it has 
been 
the concern of Uruguayan authorities to equip the National 
Directorate for Drug Fighting with modern technical equipment, 
including materials and technicians from abroad. 
  The minister also indicated that the deputy secretary of the 
presidency himself, Pablo Garcia Pintos, is the coordinator of 
the National Antidrug Fight Board, which is charged with 
drafting policies to confront the trafficking and consumption of 
narcotics. 
  Bank secrecy is one of the fundamental values of Uruguay's 
financial center, but last year the Uruguayan Central Bank 
ordered that the industry's institutions must request and 
identify complementary information on those persons who deposit 
more than $10,000 in order to prevent eventual attempts at money 
``laundering.'' 
  Three years ago the Uruguayan courts granted the extradition 
to the United States of an Argentine citizen allegedly linked to 
Colombian drug traffickers who had ordered him to invest in real 
estate in Uruguay.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Jin Yan (7246 1484) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Yunnan 
Province has achieved remarkable results in banning drug abuse 
and rehabilitating drug addicts. The total number of drug 
addicts in Yunnan dropped from 57,000 in 1990 to 40,000 last 
year. 
  Data provided by departments of the Ministry of Public 
Security show that Yunnan Province, which is near drug sources 
across the border, is one of the areas where drug abuse is most 
serious in China. In recent years, while carrying out 
well-planned investigation and sternly cracking down on drug 
criminals, Yunnan Province has done solid work to strengthen the 
banning of drug abuse and the rehabilitation of drug addicts. 
Growth in the number of new drug addicts has been curbed, and 
has dropped from 10,000 new drug addicts each year before 1990, 
to about 2,000 each year in the past three years. The 
percentage of new drug addicts among the total number of drug 
addicts has also dropped from about one-sixth in the past, to 
about one-twentieth at present. 
  Through experiments in banning drug abuse and rehabilitating 
drug addicts over the past 10 years, Yunnan Province has 
gradually formed an effective system for rehabilitating drug 
addicts which tallies with local conditions. Since 1990, Yunnan 
has helped over 20,000 drug addicts to rehabilitate themselves 
each year and has summed up and spread successful experience in 
preventing them from becoming drug addicts again. The rate of 
success in rehabilitating drug addicts is about 10 percent. 
  Over the past two years, governments at various levels in 
Yunnan Province have allocated more than 16 million yuan for 
building 28 permanent centers for rehabilitating drug addicts by 
compulsory means. The ``Rules for Running Centers for 
Rehabilitating Drug Addicts by Compulsory Means in Yunnan 
Province'' have also come into force.

  [Text] Madras, Feb. 19--The recent arrest of a judge's 
son-in-law on the charge [of] smuggling ganja has focused public 
attention on the credibility of the Tamil Nadu police and the 
admission of a writ petition by the Madras high court has 
brought the issue under judicial scrutiny. 
  The petition, filed by the editor of a Tamil weekly, 
THARASU, 
Mr. S. Shunmugam, lists four other cases pertaining to the 
alleged police abuse of the narcotics drugs and psychotropic 
substances act in the last one-year. 
  No more than 20 per cent of the cases registered under the 
act have resulted in conviction. The petitioner's point is that 
the poor conviction rate has much to do with the arbitrary 
exercise of powers by the police at the instance of the ruling 
party bigwigs. 
  The petition seeks a court directive to the Centre and the 
Tamil Nadu government for appointment of a judicial commission 
to inquire into the alleged misuse of the narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances act and abuse of its provisions for 
extraneous reasons. 
  Admitting the petition Mr. Justice Kanakaraj, ordered 
notices 
to the Union home secretary and also the state home secretary 
returnable in three weeks. 
  In his affidavit the THARASU editor said that the 
investigation conducted by his weekly indicated that the arrest 
of Mr. Alagappan, son-in-law of justice A.R. Lakshmanan, on 
January 28, was done in consultation with the ruling party 
leadership. 
  The suspect on his arrest was not told anything other than 
that he was being arrested on instructions from a senior 
official of the state law department. 
  Mr. Alagappan alias Kumar was released on conditional bail 
after three days in judicial custody. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Kumar today moved the high court, saying that 
his arrest on the ganja smuggling charge was motivated and 
obtained a two-week stay on the proceedings of the case against 
him, pending in the sessions court. [sentence as published] 
  The THARASU editor, in his affidavit, submitted that the 
narcotics drugs act was being used against a family member of a 
high court judge as a calculated move to intimidate the 
judiciary. Mr. Shanmugam submitted that his writ petition 
related to, not an isolated case against the judge's son-in-law, 
but several instances of misuse of the narcotics drugs act for 
political purposes by the ruling AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida 
Munnetra Kazhagam].

  [Text] Ahwaz, Khuzestan Prov. April, 14, IRNA -- The law 
enforcement personnel have seized nearly five tons of narcotic 
drugs after armed clashes with drug traffickers and bandits in 
the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan over the past 
two days, it was announced here Thursday. 
  Commander of the law enforcement personnel, Brigadier 
General 
Reza Seyfollahi, said his forces also seized several firearms 
from the drug traffickers. He added that the haul included 
4,700 kgs of opium and some 20 kgs of morphine. 
  According to him, the amount of drugs seized from 
traffickers 
in 1992 and 1993 stood at 65 tons and 95 tons respectively. 
  Referring to the admission of the U.S. Administration to its 
inability to fight drug trafficking at home, Seyfollahi said the 
campaign against narcotics in Iran is so tough and so serious 
that even the UN, which is under Washington's influence, has had 
to admit that Iran's campaign against narcotics must be a model 
for other countries to follow.

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Excerpts] Syrian Information Minister Muhammad Salman has 
said Syria is worried about an anti-Clinton campaign steered by 
Israel and the Zionist lobby in the United States to pressure 
the U.S. president into backtracking on understandings he 
reached with President al-Asad in Geneva and preempting a 
development in bilateral ties. 
  In remarks to foreign journalists, the minister emphasized 
that Zionist pressure had neutralized the positive signals sent 
by the Geneva summit. Clinton, according to Salman, has one of 
two choices--either defend U.S. interests in the region and thus 
put his career on the line, or give in to Zionist pressure and 
so forfeit America's credibility. 
  Salman charged that Israel was out to exclude the United 
States from the region by convincing it that its interests are 
best served by Israel. He produced an American document titled 
Syrian-American Cooperation to Combat Drugs in Lebanon, in which 
the United States applauds Syria's anti-drug measures over the 
past few years. Syria, Salman said, was bewildered by the drug 
charges, especially seeing that it has been coordinating with 
the Americans in the fight against these poisons. The pressure 
on Syria, he maintained, is calculated to undermine its 
negotiating position and split the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at 
the talks with Israel. Salman contended that drug abuse and 
trafficking in Syria are virtually nonexistent. He explained 
that drug traffickers in Syria receive the death sentence and 
abusers receive at least three years in prison. In contrast, 
the minister said, drug abuse and trafficking were widespread in 
the West, in particular in the United States. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Customs officials in Tanga have seized more than 200 
kg of mandrax worth 640 million shillings in an abandoned car at 
the Horohoro border post between Tanzania and Kenya. 
  The Tanga zonal customs controller, Ndugu Chris Koroso, told 
reporters that the driver, believed to have links with the 
consignment, ran away leaving their [as heard] car and passports 
behind. The driver told the Horohoro customs official that they 
had run short of money and requested to go to neighboring Lunga 
Lunga border post on the Kenyan side to make a telephone call to 
someone in Mombasa to seek assistance. Ndugu Koroso said that 
the two were allowed to go, on condition that they should leave 
behind their passports. But they never turned up and the car 
was towed to Tanga. 
  The Tanga regional commissioner, Honorable Azzan Aljabri, 
who 
witnessed the hoardings of the consignment, commended the 
customs officials for the job and called on them to enhance the 
campaign.

<F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: ``Government </F>
Appointing Working Group on Drugs''] 
  [Text] The government will appoint a commission to produce, 
as soon as possible, a trial arrangement whereby drug addicts 
could be sentenced to treatment instead of prison for drug 
crimes. 
  Concrete proposals for a trial arrangement are expected to 
be 
ready by October, the justice minister announced Tuesday [22 
February] in the Folketing during the first hearing of a number 
of proposals from the Progress Party [FRP], which wants to make 
radical changes in the war on drugs. 
  The FRP wants treatment sentences to begin as early as 1 
April, but the system cannot be changed that quickly, according 
to the justice minister, who was however quite receptive to many 
of the FRP proposals which, in general, were well received by 
the Folketing parties. 
<H5>  Italy: No Methadone, Just Spaghetti </H5>
  ``You do not have to go and hoard your food. It is neither 
heroin nor methadone, just spaghetti,'' the Italian treatment 
worker told a new group of drug addicts who attacked their lunch 
after a sweaty morning of working the minisettlement of San 
Carlo in the Alben Mountains near Rome. 
  This minisettlement is part of the Italian Solidarity 
Center's drug treatment program called the ``Human Project'' 
which, since the 1970's, has tried to steer drug addicts onto 
the right course. The leader of the center, Catholic priest Don 
Picchi, maintains that 85 out of 100 drug addicts complete the 
three-year treatment program. 
  Recently, the Progress Party proposed that Denmark copy the 
Italian model, and Social Welfare Minister Yvonne Herlov 
Andersen (Democratic Center) told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE today that 
she wanted to find 20 million kroner for two pilot projects. 
They would be set up according to the Italian recipe, in which 
the most important ingredients are: no methadone, no 
intoxicants--but hard physical labor and supervision around the 
clock, particularly in the beginning. 
  The ``Human Project'' is divided into three main phases: 
  An orientation phase lasting seven to nine months, during 
which the addicts are to be given motivation and discipline. The 
drug users live at home during this period, but it is the 
responsibility of their families to make sure he/she goes to 
meetings at the center. The relatives also go to therapy. 
  The second phase is in the minisettlement of San Carlo: 120 
addicts and 12 care providers--psychologists and former 
addicts--live together for eight months. Each day consists of 
hard physical labor in the morning and therapy, courses, sports, 
etc. in the afternoon. 
  The third phase is the release phase. The former addicts 
live 
in a house outside Rome. Contact with their families is 
reestablished. They look for jobs and the ``patients'' are 
prepared for a normal life without drugs. 
  After a few months they move into the ``city of 
temptation,'' 
Rome, where they live in the same house. Finally, they return 
home, but continue group therapy and personal talks for seven 
months. 
  One Dane who has been close to the treatment system is 
freelance journalist Ulla Kampmann. She lives in a small town 
outside Rome. For many months, Ulla and her husband served as a 
``family'' for a drug addict while he went through the ``Human 
Project.'' 
  She has arranged a conference on drug abuse and an 
exhibition 
Friday [25 February] in ``The House'' in Copenhagen. Italian and 
Danish care providers will exchange experiences at the 
conference.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Davidsen-Nielsen: ``Methadone Taken From </F>
Doctors''] 
  [Text] Deaths, abuse, and illegal trade have been some of 
the consequences of Denmark's liberal methadone policy. As a 
result, the government is about to take away from physicians the 
task of prescribing the morphine-like substance to drug addicts. 
Instead, this responsibility will be placed on public 
authorities. This is indicated in the government's latest report 
on drug policy, which is expected to be published in its 
entirety in the near future. WEEKENDAVISEN in is possession of a 
draft of this report, which is a result of cooperation by the 
Health Ministry, the Social Welfare Ministry, and the Justice 
Ministry. The report paves the way for a change in the 
controversial methadone treatment: 
  ``Practicing physicians have made a significant and skilled 
effort in methadone treatment, but it has been difficult for 
many physicians to continually make sure that the methadone they 
prescribe is taken by the addict to whom it is prescribed and 
delivered and that the addicts maintain contact with the social 
treatment system, in part due to a lack of available treatment.'' 
  As a result, the government wants to take the following 
step: 
``All methadone treatment, including prescription, distribution, 
and monitoring, will occur at special units under county 
supervision.'' 
  Ole Svendsen, chairman of the Practicing Physicians 
Organization (PLO), does not reject the basic idea in the 
government's report, even though it goes against the sacred 
principle of a doctor's right to prescribe drugs, but he does 
believe it would be unwise and impractical to remove all 
prescribing of methadone from the practicing physician. 
WEEKENDAVISEN learned that there has been a softening of the 
government's position on methadone. The report will not be as 
categorical in its final form. But the main message is the same. 
  Svendsen said, ``There will be cases in which it will be 
completely impossible to force drug addicts to a central unit to 
receive methadone. This is true of closet drug abusers who 
otherwise live a stable life. They would see this as being 
branded as addicts. But we are willing to give up drug addicts 
who are a heavy burden on our general practice.'' 
  According to the government's plan, in addition to 
methadone, 
addicts will receive ``supplemental treatment opportunities, so 
that an individual treatment plan will be decided on in each 
case.'' 
  If the goals of the report are achieved, there will be a 
clear change in today's drug policy. It is estimated that about 
4,000 drug addicts are now undergoing methadone treatment and 
the great majority of them receive no other form of public help. 
In 70 percent of the cases, methadone maintenance is handled by 
practicing physicians or private clinics. 
  Experts in the field are satisfied with the government's 
plan, but they say the changes will live or die by extra 
appropriations: 
  ``In the vicinity of the capital alone we will need at least 
ten new centers for controlled methadone distribution by trained 
personnel who are capable of handling the medical and social 
aspects of treatment,'' said Peter W. Jepsen, chief physician at 
Copenhagen County Hospital. 
  But there is also money to be saved, Copenhagen city medical 
officer Claus Lundstedt said. 
  Expenses can be reduced considerably by bringing addicts 
together to these centers. In this way, the costly apothecary 
stage can be eliminated as a public expense. At the same time, 
the cost of the methadone itself will be much lower as a result 
of purchasing in large quantities. 
  ``Most important, the change will mean that the methadone 
ends up in the right stomaches,'' Lundstedt said. Misuse of 
doctor-prescribed methadone has had a fatal outcome for a 
growing number of addicts. Methadone is involved in just under a 
third of all deaths among drug addicts. 
  The report on drugs also promises changes at harshly 
criticized private clinics in Copenhagen that are run primarily 
by younger physicians. Even many physicians have criticized 
these clinics, where drug addicts pay 250 to 500 kroner per 
month in the form of membership fees. 
  Health Minister Torben Lund (Social Democrat) has said he 
personally believes that there will be a ``need for additional 
efforts and capacity in the area of treatment.'' He has not 
stated, however, whether counties with responsibility for drug 
treatment will also be given additional funds.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikkel Thrane and Lotte Mejlhede: ``Special </F>
Effort For Young Drug Addicts''] 
  [Text] Politicians in Copenhagen have decided to prioritize 
their antidrug efforts in such a way that there will always be 
treatment available for the youngest addicts and 
``drug-threatened'' young people under 18 years of age. On the 
other hand, hardened addicts will have to go to the end of the 
line. 
  ``That is how prioritization works. Our hope is that a solid 
effort at a very early stage will prevent children from later 
ending up on the streets,'' said Jens Hansen, a drug-education 
consultant in Copenhagen. 
  Recently, the authorities have made room for young drug 
abusers, despite an overburdened treatment system. 
  Care providers have become concerned because new drug users 
are younger and younger. The rise in life expectancy of drug 
addicts has stagnated, so that they now live an average of 31 to 
32 years. 
  One reason for the increase in younger addicts is the 
appearance of so-called smoking heroin. There is an abundance of 
it on the streets and it is less expensive than heroin that is 
injected. 
  ``Many young people still believe they will not become 
addicted to the stuff if they smoke it, but of course that is 
wrong,'' said Lasse Gaardsoe, the leader of 24-Hour Contact in 
Copenhagen. 
  Thirty to 35 young people frequently visit 24-Hour Contact. 
Five or six of them have tried smoking heroin. 
  Copenhagen Country has set up several projects for young 
people under 18 years of age who have been drug users, but they 
still have no place for detox where they would not be in contact 
with hardened addicts. According to the Social Affairs Ministry, 
however, it is a virtual certainty that Copenhagen will soon 
receive 2.4 million kroner in subsidies for a detox center.

Methadone Treatment Is Not Enough''] 
  [Text] The right to prescribe methadone to drug addicts 
will still lie with the practicing physician, but according to 
Social Affairs Minister Yvonne Herlov Andersen (Democratic 
Center) physicians in private practice will no longer decide on 
their own that methadone treatment is the right course for a 
given drug addict. 
  ``Doctors will go to the treatment centers and a decision 
will be made by a team consisting of the physician, 
psychologists, social welfare officials, and anyone else who is 
involved at the decentralized center,'' the social welfare 
minister said. 
  Recently, the prescribing of methadone by private physicians 
has been sharply criticized both by the social welfare agencies 
of the counties and by the Physicians' Association. 
  In all too many cases, the use of methadone has not been 
complemented by actual treatment. As a result, officials at the 
Social Welfare Directorate of Copenhagen County want to assume 
responsibility for deciding whether or not methadone treatment 
is necessary. 
  ``Methadone is highly habit forming, so it is important that 
it not be used alone. It must be followed up with both social 
and psychological measures. A plan must be drawn up together 
with the addict indicating, among other things, when he will be 
drug free,'' said Peter Ege, chief social welfare physician in 
Copenhagen. 
  There are approximately 10,000 drug addicts in Denmark. It 
is 
estimated that just under 3,000 are being treated with 
methadone. By far the majority of the methadone patients are 
being treated by private physicians. The government plans to 
come out with an extensive report on drugs within the next two 
to three weeks. It will include measures to be taken in the area 
of methadone treatment.

<F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: ``Family Will </F>
Participate in Treatment''] 
  [Text] Involvement and responsibility are the code words 
for Social Affairs Minister Yvonne Herlov Andersen as she 
describes her vision of the drug world. Specifically, she wants 
to spend 20 million kroner to copy a treatment model used in 
Italy. 
  The model is called the ``Human Project'' and it comes from 
the solidarity center in Rome. The project is based on the idea 
that both the addict and his family will participate in the 
therapy. To a great extent, it is the family's responsibility to 
see that ``its'' black sheep gets back on his feet again. The 
drug addict enters a contractual agreement. If he breaks the 
contract, he must face the consequences. 
  ``To a far greater extent than now, drug addicts in Denmark 
will be responsible for their own survival. At the same time, 
their private network will take on more of the burden. The work 
that both the addict and his family perform at the treatment 
center, such as cleaning, cooking, and repair work, will be 
necessary to make the whole system work,'' Andersen said. 
  ``Danes have gotten used to the idea that the authorities 
will pull the addict through. Consequently, the Italian model 
cannot immediately replace traditional treatment. It will take 
several generations before we no longer simply step over those 
who are lying around on Stroget. But trial projects could be a 
starting point,'' the minister said.

<F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: ``Drug </F>
Families Included In Therapy''] 
  [Text] Most Danish families would gladly offer help to get 
their loved ones back on the right track after a period of drug 
abuse, many drug-treatment providers believe. 
  Yesterday, newly elected Social Welfare Minister Yvonne 
Herlov Andersen (Democratic Center) proposed that the government 
spend approximately 20 million kroner on two pilot projects 
involving drug treatment according to the Italian model, in 
which both the family and the addict have considerable 
responsibility seeing that treatment is successful. 
  The Danish drug-treatment providers would like to draw 
families into their work, but they warn against simply borrowing 
another country's treatment system. 
  ``Italian and Danish culture differ significantly. Down 
there, there is a much stronger tradition of families that go in 
and assume responsibilities that are public responsibilities 
here in Denmark,'' said Peter Ege, social welfare physician in 
Copenhagen. 
  However, he believes that, in general, it is a good idea to 
utilize the resources of the family. 
  ``We must not believe that family therapy is our only 
salvation, but my experience is that even relatively weak 
families have something to offer,'' said Anders Gormsen, head of 
the Church Army's institution for the treatment of young drug 
addicts.
