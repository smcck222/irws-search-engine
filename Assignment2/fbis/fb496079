<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Nikolay </F>
Yevsenkin under the rubric "At the Crossroads of Trade": 
"`Eldorado' in Asia"] 
  [Text] The nations of Southeast Asia, the Pacific 
Rim, are called the new "Golden Eldorado" today. Traveling 
businessmen of all the world's military companies of any 
significance are frequent visitors to government offices and 
headquarters at the very highest levels located in the capitals 
of the Asian states. These are the nations which are 
increasingly becoming the managers and organizers of prestigious 
military exhibits and shows. What the world press refers to as 
the "next great arms race" is being played out there. 
  According to many Western experts, the market in weapons of 
the Pacific Rim is becoming the most promising. Its potential 
economic volume reaches the astronomical amount of 100 billion 
dollars. 
  In order to understand the next (this time "Asian") miracle, 
one has to turn to both foreign and domestic factors. The former 
group embraces the process of forced economic growth of the 
Pacific Rim countries. Suffice it to say that in recent decades 
the combined gross national product (GNP) of China and Japan, 
and the so-called "little tigers -- Indonesia, Malaysia, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, newly 
industrialized countries (NIC) -- has grown by 160 percent, 
reaching 4 trillion dollars. The military budget of the vast 
majority of Asian nations is growing annually, most of which 
goes for the purchase of weapons abroad. 
  The foreign factors are interregional conflicts pertaining 
to 
the unresolved status of territorial disputes, the struggle for 
leadership in the region (the traditional rivalry between China 
and Japan, for example). All of this creates a qualitatively new 
situation in the world market of military exports, where a very 
fierce battle is underway for dominance of the gold-generating 
Asian niche -- the absolute leader is the USA, with Western 
Europe and Russia attempting not to fall behind. 
  The entire belt of Pacific Rim countries can be 
hypothetically broken down into three subgroups with certain 
common patterns of development of their armed forces and 
military imports. The first includes the countries in the 
northern part of the region -- China, Japan, Taiwan and the two 
Koreas -- which have a developed military industrial base and 
diversified military trade ties. 
  The most impressive is China's project for establishing an 
airborne assault grouping in the South China Sea, which would 
permit Beijing to establish domination in the body of water of 
the "inner China Sea." According to experts, this would cost 
China 4-6 billion dollars. A component of this plan is the 
purchase of supersonic Tu-22M bombers from Russia. 
  Japan's military budget reached 34 billion dollars this 
year. 
The American military-industrial complex, the strategic rival in 
the region and main supplier for Tokyo, is in strategic 
competition with Continental China. This is how one Japanese 
diplomat puts it: "If China actually purchases an aircraft 
carrier, we shall have to reconsider the strategy of the entire 
region." 
  The second group of countries (which, incidentally, actively 
import foreign weapons) includes the states of the southern part 
of Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand. At the end of the 1980's the leaders of 
most of these countries adopted large-scale programs for 
modernizing their armed forces. The government of the 
Philippines, for example, approved a 10-year plan for the 
development of its army at an estimated cost of five billion 
dollars. 
  Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have set 
themselves the task of establishing a "deep-water" navy by the 
end of the century; that is, forces capable of conducting 
operations in the open ocean, not just in coastal waters. Within 
the framework of these programs purchases of surface ships are 
being planned and implemented, their own rapid-deployment forces 
are being formed, formations of long-range fighter bombers are 
being formed capable of supporting the operations of naval task 
forces. 
  It should be mentioned that the fiercest competition for 
weapons sales among the exporting nations is developing 
precisely in these countries today. Washington is the 
unquestionable leader, but Russia also has a fairly good chance. 
According to the LOS ANGELES TIMES, Russia has something to take 
to this market. And the importing countries are taking the 
initiative. In June 1993 Malaysia's leadership announced its 
intention to purchase 18 MIG-29 aircraft. Thailand's military 
leadership is considering the purchase of transport helicopters. 
  The third group of countries includes the nations of 
post-communist Indochina. Due to their economic difficulties the 
leaders of these countries are a long way from buying modern 
armaments at the present time. Nonetheless, one should not 
forget that the 700,000-man Vietnamese army is outfitted mostly 
with our equipment and weapons. 
  The Soviet naval base established in 1978 at the port of 
Kamrahn is an advantageous project for Hanoi today. It could 
become a stable source of foreign currency. Russia is the most 
likely competitor here, since in July 1992 Vietnam's leadership 
expressed its agreement with Moscow's intention to retain this 
naval base. 
  And so, a boom in military purchases in the Pacific Rim 
countries is in the offing. Overall outlays on military imports 
have increased there from 2.5 billion (1979-1981) to 4.6 billion 
(1987-1989) dollars, an increase of 84 percent. Russia's 
military-industrial complex, which has some indisputable aces to 
play (including comparatively low prices, as well as the 
possibility of barter agreements) has a perfectly realistic 
chance for the future development of this market.

  [Text] More than 80 percent of the products from defense 
industries today are for civilian purposes: agricultural 
equipment, equipment for light, food, and chemical industry, 
machine tools and motor vehicle trailers, household radio 
equipment and televisions, gas and electric ranges, vacuum 
cleaners, bicycles, furniture, small summer houses, street cars, 
medical equipment, diesel generators, motor vehicles... 
  In 1993, the military-industrial complex produced the 
following: 
  --520,000 kW of steam turbines; 
  --20.044 billion rubles [R] worth of oilfield and drilling 
equipment and spare parts for it; 
  --nearly R10 billion worth of equipment for manufacturing 
knitted fabric; 
  --7,748 woodworking machines; 
  --3,587,500 televisions; 
  --212,000 knitting machines; 
  --3,261,200 refrigerators and freezers; 
  --188,700 motor blocks; 
  --R31.928 billion worth of automobile spare parts; 
  --R1.0163 billion worth of medicines; 
  --R33.933 billion worth of sporting equipment; 
  --3,844,000 pairs of shoes. 
  At the same time, in those areas where it is necessary to 
maintain expensive fixed assets, a sharp decrease in production 
volumes is observed: 42 percent in the arms industry; 40.2 
percent in the shipbuilding industry; and 29.9 percent in the 
electronics industry. 
  A particularly difficult situation has taken shape in the 
electronics industry, where the volume of production has 
decreased to the 1991 level to 67 percent, including to 35 
percent for military products and to 81.6 percent for consumer 
goods. Computer equipment production last year was 32 percent 
less than in 1992. 
  The 1993 budget level did not make it possible to compensate 
for the increase in cost of maintaining fixed assets of 
equipment, which are the basis of high technologies, and led to 
a decrease in the share of funds allocated for wages. As a 
result, the average monthly wage in the defense complex in 1993 
was R28,600 with the statistical average for Russia at R58,400. 
  The draft 1994 budget allocated approximately 46 percent of 
the 1993 level of funds for national defense needs. In the next 
3-4 months, this may deprive about 20 million people of means of 
existence.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Varyag' Has </F>
Converted to Knives"] 
  [Text] As a result of conversion, giants of the Far East's 
military-industrial complex, "Varyag", "Dalpribor", "Askol", and 
"Radiopribor", have begun producing top-rate medical equipment, 
which was on exhibit at the "Medical Equipment in the Maritime 
Area" symposium exhibition held in Vladivostok. 
  For four days, representatives of medical institutions of 
the 
kray familiarized themselves with the latest types of medical 
equipment. In a demonstration hall of the Primorye trade 
building there were 62 types of series-produced medical 
equipment on presented. 
  Scientists of the Far East have supplied plants with the 
latest medical instrument technologies. Of special interest were 
unique developments of micro-surgical knives for performing eye 
operations. They were created by the private enterprise 
"Dalyus." According to specialists, there is nothing like this 
high-precision equipment in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Yegorov: "Financial Squeeze for </F>
Industrialists, Scientists, and VUZ Teachers Training Cadres for 
the Defense Sector"] 
  [Text] As is known, the 1994 
draft budget calls for significant cuts in defense expenditures 
in comparison with last year: For maintenance of the Army by 
practically half, for research and development by a factor of 
2.3, for arms purchases by a factor of 5.5. Conversion programs 
approved by the government for 1993-1994 are being rolled back 
since credit resources have been provided only for the first 
quarter of this year. Besides this, we are not meeting the 
requirements of the Order of the President of Russia of 6 
November 1993 "On Stabilization of the Economic Situation of 
Enterprises and Organizations of the Defense Industry and 
Measures to Support State Defense Orders" having to do with 
development of weapons programs for the period up to the year 
2000, establishment of conditions "for stable functioning of 
defense enterprises in the market economy," financing of 
conversion and wages in the amount of eight minimal monthly 
payments. 
  The adoption of the state budget for 1994 in the form 
which is proposed by the government thus means complete stoppage 
of the majority of 3,000 scientific-research institutes [NII], 
design bureaus [KB] and plants, and discharge of a minimum of 6 
million persons directly employed in [filling] military orders 
from the sphere of material production. 
  Counting the enterprises which form whole cities and where 
no 
other work exists, the number of those suffering from the cuts 
may exceed 15 million persons. Areas of concentration of the 
defense industry in Moscow and the Moscow oblast (1.5 million 
persons), Udmurtiya, the Urals, central Russia, the Northwest, 
Novosibirsk, and Omsk will suffer especially greatly. But it is 
not only a matter of social consequences. The country is being 
stripped of its basic industrial and scientific potential. It is 
a matter of national security, the future of Russia and its 
people. This is how the directors of defense enterprises, trade 
union leaders, and scientists assess the present situation. 
  It is not hard to predict the negative consequences of 
stoppage of the defense complex. The cost of civilian goods will 
skyrocket. Export of arms will halt completely, since the 
"finishing" enterprises will not be able to close the 
technological circuits of cooperation. Already experiencing a 
shortage of up-to-date systems and equipment, the Army will be 
disarmed without international treaties and agreements. The old 
weapons grow decrepit, and new ones are not being developed or 
purchased. 
  What are we to do in this situation? In the opinion of the 
industrialists, prominent scientists, and VUZ teachers preparing 
cadres for the enterprises of the military industrial complex, 
we absolutely must raise appropriations. By a factor of two at a 
minimum. But on the other hand, this is a hard thing to do under 
present conditions, for the weight of military expenditures in 
the general budget is already excessive. What, then, is the way 
out? 
  Aleksey Shulunov, president of the League for 
Assistance to Defense Enterprises, believes it lies in 
immediate resolution of a group of problems. In particular, he 
believes, we must approve the expenditure portion of the state 
budget for the first quarter of 1994 in the amount of 
expenditures of the fourth quarter of 1993, no less. And by 
indexing that, provide industry with the means of existence in 
the coming months, while there is no annual budget. Then we must 
improve the tax legislation of Russia. Today it does not 
stimulate production or enhance the investment activity of 
enterprises. For one ruble of commodity production, says A. 
Shulunov, we pay taxes of up to 90 kopecks. 
  It is easy to see that the growth in state extortion, 
dictated by the desire to compensate for the cut in income due 
to the sharp drop in volume of production, in turn prompts the 
producer to conceal income. Just according to official data, 
last year the government failed to collect 7.5 trillion rubles 
for this reason. This is more than all military expenditures put 
together. The chairman of the Customs Committee states 
officially that budget losses due to failure to pay taxes from 
foreign economic activity amount to 10 billion dollars. And if 
monies of the shadow economy, which also circulate outside the 
sphere of tax control, are included in this sum (according to 
some data they amount to three times the annual budget), it is 
easy to see that the income portion of the budget for 1993 has 
been reduced by a factor of three. If this had not occurred, 
industry not only would avoid the "card file," but would also 
have earned money for investment. 
  The industrialists and scientists unanimously demand an 
immediate change in the existing order of military-technical 
cooperation of Russia with foreign countries, and for 
elimination of all obstacles in the path of independent export 
of arms and military equipment by defense enterprises through 
state licence. In the words of Shulunov, just the restoration of 
old commercial ties, resuscitating the export of ZIP [spare 
parts, tools, and instrument kits], and modernization and 
servicing of equipment sold in the past will bring in up to 4 
billion dollars annually to the complex. 
  Director of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute 
[TsAGI] Academician German Zagaynov says that today we 
still have in fact a system of weapons sales by the state. And 
this is a symptom of a totalitarian regime. He also names 
another possible way out from this situation -- to move from 
talking about selective support and structural 
perestroykaof industry and science to actually doing 
something. Now instead of selective support, there is dilution 
of resources at the level of the department apparatus. Says the 
Academician, it is time for the state to decide whom it intends 
to support through the budget, and to what extent. For with the 
present orders of 3 to 5 planes a year for a plant with a 
capacity of 200, everything will become pointless. The same 
applies to the scientific research institutes and design 
bureaus: often they duplicate one another. For this reason, 
state orders must be concentrated after determining the 
executors on the basis of expert assessment. As for those who 
are left without orders, give them their freedom. Freedom to 
privatize, selecting the optimal type of activity. 
  I need to make a qualification here. The directors of 
enterprises and officials of trade unions, while unconditionally 
supporting the idea itself of going public, at the same time 
sharply protest voucher privatization of their enterprises. And 
in general this is understandable. Through the sale of stock 
they could obtain sizeable resources to resume production. But 
for now the profit from privatization of state property (in 
1993) amounts to 169 billion rubles. This sum scarcely sufficed 
for conduct of check auctions and advertising. Aleksey Shulunov 
states bluntly that we must halt checkbook privatization while 
the complex still has things of value. 
  In the opinion of German Zagaynov, today we cannot "cage up" 
even those enterprises which remain "purely state enterprises." 
It is reasonable to change a number of them into technical pools 
and holding companies, where the part which is national property 
would remain state property and would be maintained out of the 
budget; and the rest, which grew up for service support and 
impart to the enterprise the nature of a subsistence economy, 
would serve as the basis for the holding company. A system of 
daughter enterprises would allow the transformation of high 
defense technologies into technologies of civilian branches of 
industry. The director of TsAGI believes that we can no longer 
put off the formation of large industrial-finance corporations 
and the merger of design bureaus and serial plants into a single 
technological and commercial structure. Otherwise we will lose 
not world markets, but our own, and will be deprived of the 
design bureaus and plants. 
  But then, we have already lost practically a third of the 
numerical strength of the defense complex. Clever and 
knowledgeable specialists have left science and design bureaus, 
so that the average age of the associates of scientific research 
institutes and design bureaus has increased sharply. There is 
practically no worthy replacement for the designers and 
engineers owing to the complete absence of so-called cadre 
accompaniment of the programs being developed in the state. The 
opinion is growing that the authors are writing them for 
themselves, eternal and ageless. 
  The Rector of Moscow State Technical University [MGTU] 
imeni N.E. Bauman, Professor Igor Fedorov, who lately has 
spoken often at various types of conferences, strives to call 
attention to the disastrous plight of his university, and also 
of other major technical VUZ of the country, the Moscow Aviation 
Institute [MAI], and the Tula and Chelyabinsk Technical 
Universities, but finds sympathy only from colleagues. In recent 
months the state has flatly refused to finance the MGTU, with 
the result that the university's indebtedness for utilities 
today amounts to 1 billion 600 million rubles. The out-of-town 
academic and experimental complex at Dmitrov, which for around 
20 years has been developed through the efforts of enterprises 
of the defense and space complex, has been frozen. And today 
practically the main concern of the rector of this VUZ, which 
graduated Korolev, Tupolev, Shukhov, Barmin, and Pilyugin, is to 
clarify relations with Mosenergo [Moscow Electric 
Company], which intends to disconnect the electrical power from 
the university. 
  In other countries this is called a shame; in ours it is 
called difficulties of the transitional period. 
  In his letter to the editors, the director of TsAGI 
Academician G. Zagaynov analyzes the situation and the ways of 
emerging from it: "Today it is hard for everyone, but for all 
the variety of state tasks and interests, we must nonetheless 
single out one and give it the status of most important -- 
assuring a worthy standard of living for Russians. Really, it is 
the only task whose start will require that we begin to speak of 
morality, of culture, and of national security. The relationship 
is clear: There is a high living standard in those countries 
where there is high technology in the basic branches of the 
economy -- machine-building, transport, power engineering, 
raw-materials and processing branches, agriculture, 
communications, construction, and the service sphere. 
  Thus it has developed that in Russia, in these civilian 
branches of the economy, the technological level is far from the 
world level. High technologies have been preserved only in the 
defense complex, and primarily in the aerospace complex. For 
this reason, technical refitting of the basic branches of the 
economy, with participation of the defense complex of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences and the higher school, should be 
considered the national task of first priority. 
  That is why the government must listen to the defense 
industry leaders first of all. Especially since not so much is 
required of it. It must use its influence to promote the union 
of defense industry leaders and civilian branches, not oppose 
the purchase of foreign technologies, and guarantee investments. 
In other words, the industrialists, scientists, and trade unions 
of the defense branches once again are offering themselves as 
allies to the government. And this is not a return to the older 
system of socialist planning. Basically, it is a market economy 
with directed influence of the state. This is how national tasks 
have been and continue to be accomplished throughout the world.

<F P=106> [Sergey Zavorotnyy, Igor Chernyak article: "Will Pinochet </F>
Save the Russian Military-Industrial Complex?"] 
  [Excerpts] In February through March, Russian aircraft led 
by the new IL-96 air-dropped powerful assault forces from the 
military-industrial complex at two opposite points on the 
earth's globe: first in Singapore, then in Chile. The aim: 
participation in the "ASIA-94" and "FIDAE-94" aerospace shows, 
on which between $1 and $1.5 million was spent. [passage omitted] 
  "We go to all these exhibition with hope. Nowadays, we are 
prepared to sell licenses, test methods, and know-how -- this 
could secure a living for ourselves and affiliated plants for 
some time at least," Academician Anatoliy Obukhov, chief 
designer at the "Bazalt" Science and Production Association, the 
Russian Federation's largest producer of mines, munitions, 
aircraft bombs, and grenade launchers, explained. "Today, I no 
longer see any other ways for the defense complex to survive." 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What, according to your calculations, is the 
safety margin for you, for munitions producers in general? 
  [Obukhov] A year, I think, for all of us. After a year, 
everything will be finished. 
  [Correspondent] But is this really such a terrible thing? 
There are many countries without these types of munitions 
plants, and they manage.... 
  [Obukhov] Let's begin from the premise that cartridges, 
projectiles, and aircraft weapons are still needed -- without 
them, the Army and Navy, even in peaceful conditions, simply 
cannot exist, not to mention the fact that the number of 
localized conflicts in the world is not decreasing. Did anybody 
bother to calculate how much it would cost to purchase all this 
abroad for our Armed Forces before destroying our own munitions 
sector? I can merely assume that nobody is going to sell us 
anything on the cheap, and that they are unlikely to make the 
latest models available for purchase. On top of all that, we 
are in this instance providing jobs not at home but abroad, and 
what is more we are falling into direct dependency on suppliers 
(and it is vital to be 100-percent sure of such alliances). 
But, in general, it has long been time to clarify our position: 
Either we consent to the role of being the West's raw materials 
appendage with all that ensues from this, or we strive to 
preserve and develop our own technologies. [Obukhov ends] 
  And there is another factor which has been voiced in one 
form 
or another in many conversations. Whether Russia likes it or 
not, its place on the armaments market may very soon, and 
without any particular hue and cry, be taken by its powerful 
southeastern neighbor. Having saturated the world with cheap 
rugs, clothes, children's toys, and other consumer goods, and 
having earned on the strength of this around $100 billion last 
year alone, it, according to expert testimony, will calmly 
undertake to buy up military technologies. A small proportion 
has already been acquired from the Russian military-industrial 
complex. The possible consequences of this require special 
discussion, but defense workers are growing increasingly certain 
that the Chinese have the power to swamp the markets with cheap 
weaponry and military hardware. 
<H5>  In America's Backyard </H5>
  What, then, was the outcome of Russia's participation in the 
Singapore and Chile exhibitions? There is no simple answer. 
After all, aircraft, like weapons, are not snapped up in a 
couple of days. [passage omitted] 
  In Santiago, we happened to strike up a conversation with 
two 
"defense workers" who had come here with the "Tor-M1" and 
"Tunguska" complexes -- the pride of the Russian 
military-industrial complex. 
  "We displayed the `Tor-M1' in Abu-Dhabi, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, and Greece, and now we have come to Chile. There 
is enormous interest everywhere," Valentin Osilov, deputy chief 
designer of the "Antey" Concern, explained. 
  [Correspondent] How many items were sold in this time, and 
to whom? 
  [Osilov] So far, not a single item. [Osilov ends] 
  The picture is the same for the "Tunguska," the only sample 
of which made its way secretly to one of the NATO countries. 
Likewise, no customers can be seen waiting in line for the vast 
majority of other military-industrial complex products either. 
Yes, of course, everyone is in raptures, the front pages of the 
newspapers are littered with huge headlines like "Russians Again 
Conquer the World!" but the problem is how to turn this into 
business.... 
<H5>  Red-Brown Bill? </H5>
  Revenue from the sale of weaponry from the USSR, and 
subsequently from Russia, fell from $20 billion in the 1980's to 
$1.9 [billion] in 1993. Much has been written about the reasons 
for this -- these include the general warming up of the 
situation in the world, the loss of major "clients" like Iraq or 
Libya, the instability of the situation in Russia, and erratic 
after-sales service, not to mention poor advertising. Would 
not, therefore, Russia be better off completely renouncing such 
persistent presentation of its aircraft, weaponry, and hardware 
abroad? 
  This would hardly be sensible -- everybody we managed to 
speak with was agreed on this. If only because nobody in the 
whole world disputes the competitiveness of Russian products. 
Yes, it is necessary to advertise them more effectively; yes, 
it is vital to seek out new contacts, to convince people of the 
superiority of our goods, to search for mutually acceptable 
options, and ultimately to win over potential partners -- 
indeed, can we survive without this? There are enough experts 
in the Russian Federation with a highly developed knowledge of 
such sensitive matters -- including in the recently created 
"Rosvooruzheniye" State Committee, the State Committee for the 
Defense Sectors of Industry, and "Aviaeksport." But, even if 
they were magicians, their efforts would be worthless without 
powerful political support. 
  The following is a trite example: When the United States 
heard about the preparations underway for Russia to sell 
Malaysia a batch of MIG aircraft, American senators and military 
experts flocked to Kuala Lumpur, and even the U.S. President's 
personal representative gave the Malaysians the honor of a 
visit. A mass of options was offered, right up to a significant 
price cut -- if only they would take the F-16 instead. As a 
result, the Americans "shoved in" their own machines, while 
Russian representatives have spent over a year fighting to 
settle the details of their contract. The managers of a number 
of U.S. firms concerned by Russia's attempt to display its wares 
in Singapore in the appropriate way also appealed to the White 
House for help. And, typically, the President did not label 
them "fascists" or take them to task for trying to become a 
burden around the neck of the American people, but instructed 
that $600,000 be allocated from the state budget to cover their 
expenses at the Singapore airshow. (It is hardly a coincidence 
that the Americans were given the lion's share of the time to 
demonstrate their hardware, and Russia as a result, to use the 
lively expression of our interlocutor, was frankly dumped.) 
Bill Clinton, like, moreover, his predecessors, is not averse, 
if need be, with Hillary at his side, to going to the other end 
of the Earth in order at odd moments to undertake the defense of 
their military-industrial complex. And advisers hardly need to 
tell him that revenue losses from the trade in weapons represent 
a loss of influence by the state, and the weakening of its zones 
of interests, or, for instance, that he who flies ultimately 
rules the world. 
  You have to have a pretty rich imagination to present Andrey 
Kozyrev or Boris Yeltsin in the role of defenders of the 
interests of the military-industrial complex.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Pedagogical Sciences, Lecturer, </F>
Retired Colonel E. Zmachinskiy: "On Subunit Tactics"] 
  [Text] Today we are becoming witnesses to major changes in 
the international situation and in the country's domestic and 
foreign policies. The peace-loving course taken by Russia in 
recent years has practically reduced to naught the danger of the 
emergence of nuclear missile war. But it is perhaps premature to 
arrive at the conclusion that no one and nothing threatens 
Russian statehood. (Unfortunately, some politicians are 
attempting to convince people of that in the mass media). It is 
impossible to ignore the fact that combat operations are 
becoming increasingly widespread in the near abroad and also 
everything is not peaceful in the far abroad. 
  Battles of "local significance" are being conducted, as a 
rule, by small armed detachments and groups, and not always 
skillfully from the point of view of tactics. Hence the increase 
of unwarranted losses. Officers who have completed higher 
military schools and academies are leading compulsory service 
personnel who have completed their military obligation and on 
the whole well-trained guerrillas. All of this permits us to 
doubt to a certain extent the correctness of previously solid 
approaches to training people and suggests the thought on the 
need to examine certain views that affect the tactics of small 
subunits and their comprehension. 
  This question appears to be fundamental first of all because 
the result of a small subunit battle directly impacts the combat 
operations of a larger tactical echelon on which the course and 
outcome of an operation frequently depend. Furthermore, the 
practitioners -- the soldiers and officers, through whose hands 
victory is attained, first of all pay for the theorists' 
mistakes. 
  Any science is in constant development. As a component of 
military science (military art), tactics are also modified from 
time to time. What specific features in small subunit 
operational tactics have emerged today? 
  There are several of them. I will begin with the 
advisability, in my view, of imparting a somewhat different 
characterization to the opposing side. While studying tactics as 
an academic discipline, we perceived and perceive the enemy in 
the form of a specific organic structure with definite (known 
beforehand) personnel strength, weapons, combat tactics, 
standards, etc. 
  However, in our time, this stereotype is nothing other than 
harm and we cannot bear it. Armed conflicts are conducted 
according to other "laws". Consequently, it makes sense to 
present the enemy numerically. That is, based upon the number of 
opposing personnel and armored targets, weapons emplacements and 
so forth. And it is hardly worthwhile to delve into the details 
of the opposing side's organic structure or, say, its unit 
affiliation while accomplishing a training or actual combat 
mission on the squad, platoon or company scale. It seems to me 
that the main thing here is knowledge of the actual enemy and 
his capabilities that have been obtained based upon intelligence 
data. 
  The typical diversity of the enemy and therefore, the 
unpredictability of his operations, increases the role of the 
latter. We can encounter a completely unfamiliar structure and 
even its absence (as it occurred in Afghanistan) instead of 
theoretically known enemy formations in one-on-one combat with 
spontaneously created detachments and groups. 
  Formerly, subunit combat capabilities were examined in 
detail 
when studying their tactics. Now, I think, we need to pay 
attention to combat requirements on a par with them. What does 
that signify? First of all the need to establish the number of 
targets that are subject to destruction to attain success in 
battle. For example, on an offensive -- 100% of the 
weapons 
that are preventing us from seizing the target of the attack. On 
defense -- no less than 50% of the attackers' personnel 
and 
weapons. 
  As for the combat missions (their parameters) and forming 
up, 
obviously, the time has come to more precisely define certain 
provisions of the Field Manual. By way of illustration, the 
currently legitimized method of forming up the defending troops 
with the presence of large gaps in them causes bewilderment. You 
won't manage to reliably cover gaps between subunits at night, 
under conditions of poor visibility, and in a number of cases 
during the day. A battle most often carries over onto broken 
terrain and soldiers and weapons are located in trenches, that 
is, practically on the surface of the earth. Details of the 
relief, vegetation, ground features, dust and smoke 
substantially impede surveillance and the conduct of aimed fire. 
As events in the Persian Gulf demonstrated, it is already 
impossible to consider various types of impediments to be 
impenetrable barriers. In my opinion, subunits that are 
operating according to today's standards are doomed to defeat 
from the beginning. 
  How should we act? We most likely need to return to the 
experience of the concluding stage of the Great Patriotic War. 
The standards that were applied at that time appeared as a 
result of painstaking analysis of a multitude of previous 
battles and engagements. We can say that they became the essence 
of the maturity of our tactics and ultimately were one of the 
main factors in the attainment of victory over the enemy. It is 
probably no accident that the leading war colleges of the entire 
world have been intently studying the experience of those years 
until now. 
  A few words about the motorized rifle squad. In the existing 
organic structure, it is actually incapable of operating in a 
combat situation with adequate effectiveness. The fact is that 
we cannot even think about similar formations that previously 
existed and that currently exist in a number of foreign armies 
without hand-to-hand combat. Practically no one in a motorized 
rifle squad participates in it. A driver (driver-mechanic), 
machinegunner (loader-operator), machinegunner, sniper, and an 
RPG [rocket propelled grenade] man with an assistant are here in 
secondary and even tertiary roles and are hardly capable of 
affecting its outcome. Moreover, in the war years it was thought 
that you needed to have no less than 10 men in the squad line 
for a successful attack on a front of up to 50 meters. 
  How does the author of these lines see a modern squad? A 
commander, 10 riflemen with automatic weapons (of them one -- is 
the assistant RPG man and, possibly, one is the combat vehicle 
commander, a machinegunner, an RPG man, a sniper, machinegunners 
(loader-operators), and drivers (driver-mechanics). A total of 
18 men and two armored vehicles. In this case, a team of fire 
support riflemen is drawn in great detail which is extremely 
important in cases of limited capabilities of artillery and 
aircraft, and also without joint participation of a tank subunit 
with the motorized riflemen in a battle. In any case, the 
emergence of similar situations is not excluded. 
  A squad of that structure is capable of defending itself on 
a 
front of 100-150 meters and up to 100 m in depth. In an 
offensive, the motorized riflemen can operate while located 
either behind the armored vehicles or ahead of them, or while 
having one ahead and the other with the fire support group 
behind the squad line. That is, the movement of BTR's [armored 
transport vehicles] and BMP's [armored infantry vehicles] will 
in some ways begin to remind you of the flight of a pair of 
aircraft -- the flight leader and the wing man which, in my 
opinion, makes sense. 
  The subunit combat capability calculation methods proposed 
by 
the tactics training manuals also need to be made more precise. 
Let's take as an example the recommended number of bullets 
expended per meter of front per minute. It is thought that the 
higher the density of fire the greater the probability of 
attaining victory. It would seem that everything is correct from 
the point of view of theory. However, in practice, infantry did 
not and will not conduct small arms fire against lines or areas. 
It fires against specifically visible live targets. And the 
outcome of the battle does not depend on the number of bullets 
expended but on the number of targets destroyed. 
  Meanwhile, it is easy to calculate combat capabilities if 
you 
actually determine the time for conducting aimed fire (while 
taking into account the training of personnel). Say, in the 
defense -- from the moment of the appearance of targets until 
their closure with the forward edge of the battle area and the 
transition to a hand-to-hand skirmish. 
  Average weapons combat capability coefficients were also not 
presented in the best manner. For example, they total 0.3-0.4 
for an RPG [rocket propelled grenade]. This question is 
appropriate: Is it true that a tank will not be hit until they 
assemble 3-4 RPG men together in a subunit? Where do these 
numbers come from? Perhaps they result from the calculation of 
the overall combat capabilities of the weapons that are taking 
part in a battle. And if they don't cause any doubts on one 
structural level (in a division or regiment), then they don't 
appear to be very well substantiated on another (in a squad, 
platoon or company). Here I would say we need another, weightier 
approach. 
  How are coefficients that are interpreted so unambiguously 
dangerous? First of all by the reduction of soldiers' confidence 
in their weapons. Military school graduates in the troops 
transfer their knowledge to their subordinates who in turn are 
justified in arriving at the conclusion on the inadequate 
effectiveness of the weapons assigned to them. Therefore, we 
need to provide the appropriate explanations when we discuss 
subunit combat capabilities. 
  I also have to say something about the Ground Forces Field 
Manual. It was never as large as it is today. The current 
edition contains many repetitions, some articles and attachments 
are excessively detailed, and certain inconsistencies are 
observed with the combat operations regulations of the branches 
of the armed forces and on the types of combat support, and with 
other guiding documents. I think that only the primary 
provisions should be set forth in it and it is better to provide 
for all the rest in training manuals and regulations. 
Furthermore, we must simplify the work of commanders of small 
subunits to the maximum extent possible, reducing their 
activities to command and control of subordinates in battle to 
short commands and signals. For example, in an offensive: 
"Platoon (squad), attack up to some landmark -- FORWARD". In the 
defense: "Platoon (squad), to some line or other -- ACTION." Of 
course, personnel must be well trained and know their duties in 
battle. 
  In conclusion, I will point out that, having set forth my 
personal point of view, I do not lay claim to the truth in the 
highest instance. However, I consider it necessary to sometimes 
examine the established canons of military art from a critical 
angle. Tactics will only gain from that.

<F P=106> [Article by Major-General Ivan Nikolayevich Vorobyev under </F>
"Army and Society" rubric: "War Without a Front or Rear or 
Several Lessons in `Non-stereotypical' Tactics"] 
  [Text] The Russian Army is living through a complex 
period. There are a great many problems that are distracting 
military people from their professional business. They are 
nevertheless trying not to lose their professionalism. Despite 
everything, combat and operational training is continuing in the 
forces and they are engaged in their studies and command post 
and operational exercises.... The letters to the editor are 
symptomatic: Again we are seeing letters form officers 
requesting that we more often publish articles on the problems 
in the training of the forces and on current trends in the 
development of operational art and tactics. 
  In responding to these requests, we are publishing an 
article by Major-General of the Reserves Ivan Nikolayevich 
Vorobyev. He is a doctor of military sciences, a professor, and 
a meritorious scientist of the Russian Federation. He was born 
in Tambov Oblast in 1922. He served in the Soviet Army from 1940 
until 1987. In the war, he commanded a platoon, a company, and a 
rifle battalion. He worked for a long time in the administration 
of the Ministry of Defense. He has a number of scientific works 
on the problems of operational art and tactics. 
<H5>  Current Problems in Military Science </H5>
  In reading the second part of the title, someone will 
probably ask: Is it really necessary to subdivide tactics into 
various versions? He would say that tactics, as the art of 
waging war, must be "universal" and "comprehensive" and must 
guarantee the successful training and actions of the forces 
under all circumstances. 
  Yes, that is what the theory teaches. But life, as we know, 
is richer. Examples? To bring the forces of the 40th Army that 
fought in Afghanistan up to strength, we were forced to train 
reinforcements in a special center. Despite the fact that the 
personnel selected for this were already sufficiently "broken 
in," it was simply necessary to retrain the people, because the 
"classical" tactics that they assimilated in the forces, 
military schools, and academies was not at all suitable for the 
conditions of Afghanistan. In that war, nothing happened as 
written in the textbooks. There was no clearly defined front and 
rear. The enemy could appear from anywhere and strike at any 
time. Under these conditions, our forces needed "nonstandard" 
tactics. Unfortunately, however, it was often worked out in the 
course of the battle. 
  A no less typical example is that of the combat actions of 
the Americans in Vietnam. They fought there for 10 years and 
during all of that time they continually searched for tactical 
procedures that would meet the local conditions. The theater of 
war represented a unique "patchwork" in which the hot spots 
arose spontaneously in one place or another.... 
  Unfortunately, it happened that essentially the experience 
of 
neither the Vietnam nor the Afghan nor other local wars was in 
demand by Soviet military art. It was considered random and 
untypical; thus for a long time was not used in the training of 
the forces. It is now time to correct this unfortunate mistake. 
There will likely be a place in the new field manuals for 
positions affecting the actions of the forces not only under the 
conditions of a large-scale war but also under the conditions of 
armed conflicts. By the way, this flows directly out of the 
demands of the new military doctrine of the Russian Federation, 
where it is noted that today there is an increasing danger of 
the rise of armed conflicts. 
  So, taking this into account, what actions must the forces 
be 
prepared to undertake? Above all, as was already mentioned 
above, the conditions of warfare in armed conflicts are 
extremely varied. The means of action that were worked out for a 
"large" war cannot be mechanically transfered to this area. In 
addition, the opposing sides usually have a different level of 
military organization, training, and technical equipment. At the 
same time, this does not at all mean that one must be oriented 
toward "simplified" tactics. Precisely local wars gave an 
impulse to the development of many new and rather effective 
means of combat operations. During the time of the Korean War, 
for example, the tactic of "tunnel warfare" arose and was widely 
used, the tactic of air mobile operations came into being in 
Vietnam, and the tactic of remote combat developed in the Middle 
East (1967, 1979, and 1982). 
  A special feature of local wars is that they usually become 
a 
range for the testing of new tactical concepts and kinds of 
military hardware. Thus, in Korea, they first used jet fighters, 
guided missiles of the "ship-to-air" class, helicopters, and new 
kinds of tanks. In Vietnam, they tested new jet bombers, 
supersonic fighters, artillery and missile systems, elements of 
the AVACS system, several kinds of aerial cluster bombs, 
including "Lazy Dog" bombs, the fragments (10,000) of which 
destroy a target over an area of 700 square meters, the "Snake 
Eye" bomb (weight 250 kg) equipped with an umbrella stabilizer, 
"Armalit" rifles that fire "tumbling" bullets, the "Vulcan" 
gun-machinegun with a rate of fire of 6,000-8,000 rounds per 
minute, "Strike" air-launched missiles, and antiaircraft 
missiles. In the wars in the Middle East, they first used combat 
helicopters with antitank guided missiles, "Merkava" tanks, new 
types of aircraft and helicopters, self-propelled artillery, 
tactical missiles, portable antiaircraft systems, and guided 
air-launched missiles. Especially intensive use was made of the 
means of radioelectronic warfare. The Americans carried out mass 
tests of combat equipment and arms during the war in the zone of 
the Persian Gulf: Systems of highly accurate weapons, "SLAM" and 
"ATAKMS" missiles, "Patriot" antiaircraft missiles, the heavy 
bomber GBU-15, and new models of the means of communication, 
radio-electronic warfare, and radio, radioengineering, and space 
reconnaissance. 
  In analyzing the experience in local wars in the 1950's 
through the 1990's, it is important to note that maneuvering 
forms of combat prevailed in them over position forms. A long 
positional confrontation of the sides was noted only during the 
time of the war in Korea. In all other wars, if such a 
phenomenon occurred it was only for a short time and episodic. 
And the possible armed conflicts of the future will hardly be an 
exception to this rule. Such is the tendency in the development 
of military science: With the increase in the power and speed of 
weapons and in the maneuvering capability of the forces, there 
is an ever greater displacement from the arsenal of tactics of 
such companions of positional confrontation as penetration and 
the use of unbroken, trench, and deeply echeloned defense. 
Naturally, the application of rigid methods in the operations of 
the forces is receding into the past and the "geometry" of the 
battlefield is changing fundamentally in that it is becoming 
"nonlinear" and "multidimensional." 
  Operations of forces under the conditions of an "expanded 
battlefield", (that is, in individual points of combat, in the 
absence of a clearly defined front line and direct contact of 
units with their neighbors and with the enemy), apparently will 
become new features of contemporary tactics that may be 
manifested especially clearly in local armed conflicts. For it 
is usually rather limited forces and systems that are involved 
in conflicts and their action is concentrated in time and space. 
It can be expected that the opposing side will not always strive 
to engage in "open" combat. More often he will prefer to avoid a 
direct clash with an enemy with superior numerical strength and 
will try to "slip away" from the strike. It must be assumed that 
under these conditions the basic operational methods will be 
surprise attacks like a "swarm of bees" against individual 
facilities, especially against unprotected command and control 
facilities, rear bases, truck convoys, guard posts and security 
detachments, checkpoints, and individual garrisons. It is 
possible that extensive use will be made of ambushes, the 
setting of traps, the mining of roads, and acts of terrorism. 
Nor can one rule out large-scale clashes that under same 
conditions may grow into large-scale operations. 
  But it appears that most characteristic for conflicts will 
still be frequent episodic battles. Hence, the commanders and 
staffs will have to make use of other methods of work in the 
organization and carrying out of combat operations than those 
that are being used, let us say, in the penetration of a 
prepared defense. Those normative indicators that were developed 
in combat and training practice and set forth in the current 
field manuals are not applicable here. Most often the grouping 
of the "nonstandard" enemy will be quite heterogeneous. It may 
include the most diverse formations in terms of combat 
qualities. And it is impossible to assess them using generally 
accepted methods and operating with "averaged measures." Some 
units may be well armed and trained and their combat potential 
may conditionally be assigned the value of one. Others will be 
less well trained and will be more poorly equipped technically. 
Accordingly, the level of their combat capability will be lower. 
  It is also rather difficult to assess the qualitative 
parameters of one's own forces. What are the criteria for 
defining the combat possibilities of units and subunits in the 
waging of counterguerrilla warfare? How much force and what 
systems are needed to counteract ambushes, to prevent acts of 
sabotage, to protect and defend communications, and to carry out 
reconnaissance and search operations? All of these are questions 
that are not easily answered. 
  Many difficulties in making the decision to engage in combat 
will also arise because the commander does not by any means 
always see the real enemy before him. It will be very difficult 
to carry out reconnaissance, because the forces, as a rule, will 
be assigned an extensive zone of responsibility or combat 
operations. During the war in Afghanistan, for example, the 
divisions were assigned a zone of combat operations along a 
front of 400 to 600 km in a depth of 200 to 400 km, regiments 
were assigned a sector 100 to 150 km wide along the front and 
50-80 km in depth, and for the battalion it was 30-40 km along 
the front in a depth of 15-20 km. It is understandable that it 
is possible to study such a large region and to investigate 
routes extending over several dozen or hundreds of kilomters 
only with the help of helicopters. But here is where new 
difficulties arise: How in this case can one specify the tasks 
of the units and subunits in the terrain, determine the regions 
of the artillery firing positions, the order for overcoming 
artificial obstacles, etc? 
  The situation is also complicated by the fact that the means 
available to the forces for reconnaissance, command and control, 
and support as well as the weapons and in general the 
organizational personnel structure of the combined units are not 
at all adapted to such conditions. Here it is appropriate to 
remember the experience in Afghanistan, in particular the 
experience in the decentralized use of forces and weapons. There 
were practically no cases in which a division operated at full 
strength. And it was infrequent that they made use of the 
regiment. As a rule, they established an improvized detachment 
for the accomplishment of some particular combat task or other 
such as the destruction of a recognized base of the enemy, for 
example -- usually on the basis of a reinforced motorized rifle 
battalion. Its actions were supported by artillery, combat 
helicopters, and aviation. The Americans operated in an 
analogous manner in Vietnam. 
  Thus, combat experience teaches: a unique "detachment" 
("group") system of actions can become typical for armed 
conflicts. The combat strength of the established detachments 
may differ. The main thing here is to support their fire and 
tactical independence and capability of operating for a long 
time (two or three days) separately from the main forces of 
one's own troops and the rear base. It is expedient to form 
detachments under the principle of specific designation, for 
example it is necessary to have a reconnaissance and search 
detach to determine the combat strength and precise location of 
enemy groupings. 
  It is advisable to have a raiding and assault detachment to 
carry out raiding and assault actions for the purpose of 
identifying and destroying a particular grouping of the enemy. 
Its basis is mobile (armored and motorized rifle) subunits 
strengthened with artillery and engineering subunits. To seal 
off important facilities at the disposition of the enemy, it is 
necessary to have blocking detachments that essentially include 
motorized rifle subunits. The support of the actions of 
reconnaissance-search, raiding-assault, and blocking detachments 
will require strike detachments established primarily on the 
basis of artillery subunits and subunits of combat helicopters. 
  As experience shows, it is not advisable to assign a 
strictly 
limited zone of action to a detachment, especially a 
reconnaissance-search or raiding-assault detachment, for this 
will paralyze their maneuver. It is enough for them to determine 
the general direction of the actions and the objectives -- 
immediate, intermediate, and final. If the enemy grouping is 
determined insufficiently fully (and this may be the case very 
often), then it is expedient to practice "alternative" planning, 
that is, to determine not one but two and sometimes even three 
possible versions of the action. 
  It is understandable that the method of "actions by 
detachments" can be quite effective only in the event of 
thorough organization and comprehensive support. Because it is 
by no means always possible to apply active-offensive forms of 
combat, the forces must be able to engage in delaying and 
stabilizing actions. That is, it will no longer be defense in 
its classic form. Delaying actions infer the establishment of 
mobile (air mobile) screens and migratory weapons positions and 
the setting up of ambushes and killing zones in the path of the 
enemy's advance. 
  In the event of the lack of the necessary number of weapons, 
the most acceptable thing here may be the selective-restrictive 
method of effecting the enemy, the essence of which is the 
selection of the most important facilities in his grouping and 
concentration on the suppression of most of the weapons 
operating in the given sector. In covering open flanks for the 
purpose of counteracting the close and wide envelopments of the 
enemy, use can be made of the barrier-blocking method, which 
infers the establishment of fire barriers primarily on natural 
boundaries in combination with the remote mining of the terrain. 
  Since combat operations under these conditions are developed 
on a broad front but artillery has a limited range of fire, 
combat helicopters play a greater role in the fire support of 
the forces. Use may also be made of mixed groups of aircraft and 
helicopters put together from reconnaissance and combat (strike) 
helicopters and ground attack aircraft. 
  In short, again and again we have been convinced that there 
are no "easy" wars and that one must prepare the forces 
thoroughly for even what at first glance would seem to be an 
insignificant military conflict. Today the experience of local 
wars and military conflicts -- and about 200 of them have been 
unleashed in the world from 1945 through 1992 -- is especially 
valid for us, because, as was recently stated at one of the UN 
sessions, "the bell of every regional conflict tolls for all of 
us."

  [Text] It is difficult to imagine a state would not 
be concerned about its internal security. 
  The fundamental reforms that established the 
organizational bases of the entire internal service on the scale 
of the Russian state date back to the time of the reign of 
Alexander I, who on 16 January 1811 signed an edict on the 
establishment of a special kind of troops--the internal guard 
including local military commands, which previously were under 
the jurisdiction of the civil authorities and along with the 
police were responsible for the "preservation of peace and 
calm." "...the provincial companies and regular commands," 
stated a document from the "highest" level, "should be better 
organized and made to conform to their current service function 
and to the general order and we order that all these commands be 
transferred from civilian to military authority...." 
  The emperor's edict from 27 March to the military 
minister ordered the regular provincial companies and commands 
to be redeployed in the capitals of the provinces [guberniyas] 
and internal guard battalions to be formed from them. At the 
decision of the Military Collegium a month later, these 
battalions were brought together in 20 brigades. On 3 July 1811, 
the "Statute for the Internal Guard" was affirmed at the highest 
level. 
  In comparing the tasks of Russia's contemporary 
internal troops with those of their predecessors, one can find 
much in common. And there is perhaps nothing surprising about 
this: There have been changes in the political situations, 
social foundations, and nature of crime and violations of the 
law but the essence of military service in defense of the 
interests of the state, society, and individual, the 
"preservation of peace and calm," has remained as it was. 
  A special page in the history of the internal troops 
was the participation in the Great Patriotic War in 1941-1945. 
Not many people know that on that memorable June morning the 
fascist forces first hit not only our border troops but also our 
troops at small garrisons guarding railroad bridges and other 
structures along the western border. In the first weeks of 
military action, the internal troops sent to the fighting army 
large and well-trained forces, forming 15 rifle divisions, which 
operated in the most dangerous sectors of the front. All of them 
fought courageously and some subsequently received honorary 
names. 
  The manner in which the internal troops fought is 
shown, among other things, by the fact that an individual 
special-purpose motorized rifle brigade that was formed in 1941 
and became an educational center for the training of 
reconnaissance-subversion groups for actions in the enemy's rear 
trained 22 Heroes of the Soviet Union. Among them were the 
commanders of partisan formations D. Medvedev (the legendary 
scout N. Kuznetsov operated in his detachment), V. Karasev, F. 
Ozmitel, and others. 
  Altogether more than 200 servicemen trained by the 
internal troops were honored with the lofty title of Hero during 
the period of the Great Patriotic War. 
  The soldiers and sergeants, warrant officers and officers of 
the internal troops perform an entire spectrum of the most 
varied missions: They perform guard and convoy duty, they 
support the public order in cities and towns, and they 
participate in the elimination of the consequences of 
earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as the freeing 
of hostages from the grip of terrorists.... For several years 
now, servicemen of the internal troops have been providing for 
public security at so-called "hot spots" in regions where states 
of emergency prevail. 
  The troops have all that they need to handle such complex 
and 
multifaceted missions. They include not only combined units and 
operational units but also special motorized, air, and naval 
units. The internal troops have a solid base for the training of 
junior commanders and various kinds of specialists. 
  Those wishing to tie their fate to the troops may do so 
by signing a contract for three or five years. Men 18 to 40 
years of age are accepted for contract service on a voluntary 
basis. For some positions, women from 20 to 40 years of age are 
accepted. 
  Questions involving contract service in the troops are 
resolved in the military units of internal troops of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia and also by the military 
commissariats of the republics in the Russian Federation, 
autonomous okrug, kray, or oblast, and cities of Moscow and St. 
Petersburg. 
  The officer corps is formed from graduates of higher 
military educational institutions of the internal troops. Here 
are their addresses: 
  Vladikavkaz Higher Military Command Red Banner School 
imeni S.M. Kirov--362005, g. Vladikavkaz, 5; 
  Novosibirsk Higher Military Command School--630114, g. 
Novosibrisk, 114; 
  Saratov Higher Military Red Banner Command School imeni 
F.E. Dzerzhinskiy--410023, g. Saratov, 23; 
  St. Petersburg Higher Military Command School--198075, 
g. Sankt-Peterburg, 75; 
  Perm Higher Military Command-Rear School--614108, g. 
Perm, 108 
  The schools accept inducted personnel, reserve personnel 
with 
a military service obligation, service personnel in extended 
service at the end of two years of extended service, and warrant 
officers at the end of two years of service in positions of 
warrant officers or officers no older than 23 years of age; also 
civilian youths 17 to 21 years of age. 
  Service personnel wishing to enter a school present a 
request 
to the command prior to 1 April and those with a service 
obligation and civilian youths submit an application to rayon 
(city) military commissariats or internal affairs sections in 
their place of residence prior to 1 May. 
  The graduates of higher military educational institutions 
are 
assigned the rank of lieutenant and are given a diploma of the 
Russian type with conferment of the qualification of jurist (for 
higher military command schools) or engineer of a particular 
profile (for the Perm Higher Military Command-Rear School). 
  Both officers finishing higher troop schools and contract 
personnel among those accepted for service on a voluntary basis 
have good opportunities to improve their education. 
  You can be certain that when you enter into service in 
the troops you obtain guarantees of your social protection! 
  Persons performing service in the internal troops are 
assured monetary remuneration in the manner and in accordance 
with the standards set by the Government of the Russian 
Federation for service personnel. 
  Service personnel of the internal troops are granted 
certain privileges guaranteed by the laws of the Russian 
Federation on the internal troops of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of the Russian Federation and on the status of service 
personnel: 
  --payment of monetary compensation instead of a food ration, 
the amount of which changes as prices rise, being equal to 1,445 
rubles [R] a day beginning 1 February of this year; 
  --payment at the end of the year of a monetary award for the 
conscientious performance of duties in the amount of three 
salaries for the duty assignment and military rank; 
  --payment of an award for class qualification of up to 7 
percent of the salary for the duty assignment; 
  --payment of a bonus for special service conditions up to 60 
percent of the duty salary; 
  --provision of material assistance once a year in the amount 
of one salary for the duty assignment and military rank. 
  In set cases at the request of the service personnel, 
they are issued an interest-free loan in the amount of 12 
salaries for the duty assignment and military rank over a period 
of up to three years for the initial provision of a 
household. 
  Those entering service in the troops are freed from the 
payment of income tax on monetary compensation, monetary awards, 
and other payments that they receive in connection with the 
performance of the obligations of their military service and 
also from the payment of the land tax and property tax. 
  Provision is made for the compulsory state individual 
insurance of the service personnel of the internal troops; 
for free transportation on all kinds of public 
transportation in the cities, suburbs, and localities (except 
taxis), and also--in utilizing basic leave to the site of 
their leisure activity and back, including by air; a free 
one-way trip once a year for family members of contract service 
personnel--to the place of leave and back. 
  To this one must also add the following 
possibilities: 
  --free medical assistance in military-medical subunits, 
units, and institutions and the possibility for service 
personnel and members of their families to rest and improve 
their health in the rest homes and sanatoria of the internal 
troops and Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia; 
  --aid to the wives of servicemen who do not have the 
possibility of finding work at the place of service of their 
husbands; 
  --provision of places in children's preschool institutions 
for children of service personnel with payment under favorable 
conditions; 
  --provision of monetary compensation for cadets undergoing 
schooling at military educational institutions of the internal 
troops beginning with the second course at the norms for 
personnel serving under contract. And this is despite the fact 
that they are provided other kinds of allowances (food, personal 
property, medical services, and others) free of charge. 
  The Law of the Russian Federation on the Status of Service 
Personnel also provides for: 
  --payment of monetary compensation with the departure of the 
serviceman for leave in the amount of six minimum payments for 
labor as set by law (as of the time of departure for leave) for 
the serviceman himself and three minimum payments for labor as 
set by law for his wife and for each minor child. 
  It is also worth knowing that service personnel without 
permanent living quarters or in need of improving their living 
conditions are provided free financial aid for the acquisition 
of housing: 
  --not less than 75 percent of the cost of living quarters 
for 
those with a total service time of 10 to 25 years and 100 
percent for those having served 25 years or longer; 
  --payment of living space, municipal services, and the 
installation and use of apartment telephones amounts to 50 
percent of the cost. 
  If the service personnel of the internal troops serve 
in remote places or places with severe climatic conditions, they 
are paid more for the performance of their duties (up to 100 
percent more) and also a bonus for uninterrupted service in 
these places (up to 100 percent of the salary for the duty 
position and military rank). 
  The service personnel of the internal troops are 
granted additional privileges for the performance of missions in 
defense of the constitutional rights of citizens under the 
conditions of a state of emergency and under the conditions of 
armed conflicts: 
  --payment of additional salaries and salaries twice the 
standard for the military rank; 
  --one month of military service in these regions counts as 
three; 
  --mission expenses are paid for the entire period of the 
performance of the tasks; 
  --additional leave amounting to 10 calendar days is granted 
for each 3 months of military service in these regions. 
  [Boxed material] So, you have been given some information to 
think about. 
  Your choice depends on you and you alone. 
  BUT IF YOU are dreaming of the romance of military service, 
are not afraid of difficulties, and do not consider yourself a 
weakling and if you want to participate directly in the building 
of a law-governed state, are prepared in the role of a soldier 
of peacemaking forces to act where your help is needed, and are 
not averse to fighting for the right to wear the red beret of 
the special forces, then you will have made the right decision! 
  The internal troops are waiting for you! 
  [Additional boxed material under the heading "In One 
Paragraph"] 
  The elite of the internal troops is a special-purpose 
formation. They are always prepared to tackle on short notice 
any military mission thousands of kilometers from the place of 
their deployment. By no means everyone has the right to wear the 
red beret of the special forces. It must be earned through 
outstanding performance in special training and through flawless 
execution of the soldier's duty. 
  856 officers and warrant officers of the internal troops 
took 
part in combat operations in the Republic of Afghanistan as 
military advisers. 522 of them were given state awards. 
  In the last two years alone, operational and special 
motorized military units carried out more than 50,000 service 
and combat missions. 2,142 firearms and 236,000 pieces of 
ammunition of various kinds were confiscated by front-line 
details together with internal affairs agencies or 
independently; they confiscated 2,165 grenades and explosive 
devices and 24 pieces of armored equipment. 
  In eliminating the consequences of the 1988 earthquake in 
Armenia, troop personnel saved 659 people and confiscated from 
plunderers and turned over to the state money and material 
assets valued at R9,157,150. Patrol details arrested 203 robbers 
and marauders and confiscated 44 firearms and a large quantity 
of ammunition. The fund to help the population suffering from 
the disaster collected R531,237 and 3,154 liters of blood were 
given. 
  More than 14,500 servicemen of the internal troops 
participated in the elimination of the consequences of the 
accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, whereby 276 of 
them were awarded orders and medals for self-sacrificing actions 
and 162 officers were given military ranks one level higher than 
is foreseen for the position that they hold. 
  Altogether more than 4,300 servicemen of the internal troops 
were given state awards in the period from 1989 through 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Vladimir Martynenko, candidate of </F>
economics and chairman of the Military-Economic Society, and 
Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Ivanyuk: "Traditions and Today: 
Military-Economic Societies: What We Can Expect From Them"] 
  [Text] It is no exaggeration to say that 1993 was a year of 
disappointment for servicemen in a material sense. And not 
because incomes did not grow as one would have liked and as had 
been promised, that military pay was held up for months, and 
many benefits provided by legislation were frozen. Something 
else became clear as well: Given the financial crisis, none of 
the declared priorities of supporting the Armed Forces are going 
to be met. The situation cannot be relieved by threatening 
orders from above, bold red inscriptions on financial and 
economic documents, or other administrative-command methods. As 
a result, beginning in the second quarter of last year, the Army 
and Navy began to suffer shortages of the most essential 
items--fuels and food. And those who entrusted the solution of 
their problems to all manner of funds created to provide social 
protection to servicemen were bitterly disappointed. The money 
had gone down the drain, as they say, and with it their faith in 
any nongovernmental initiatives in this area. The question must 
now be posed in the following terms: Will the Russian Armed 
Forces survive under market economy conditions or not? 
  The market system, as we know, has existed for more than a 
few decades. It would be strange to think that the world has not 
yet devised mechanisms to help servicemen adapt to its harsh 
terms and specific rules. One such mechanism is the creation of 
military-economic societies. Their prototype arose in Holland 
back in 1819. The Equipment Capital enabled officers to obtain 
equipment and supplies of the highest quality at modest prices. 
  Late in the last century, military-economic societies began 
being created in many of the world's countries -- Germany, 
France, Japan, Portugal, Spain. In Russia, the charter of the 
first consumers union for St. Petersburg sailors, known as 
Thrift, was confirmed in 1880. The Economic Society of Guards 
Corps Officers arose in 1891 and was the largest up to that 
time. By 1915 such societies were functioning in the Kiev, 
Odessa, Kazan, and Moscow military districts and in many large 
garrisons. They provided their members with discounts on goods 
and services of up to eight percent off average prices. They did 
so by opening their own stores, warehouses, and repair shops and 
by concluding contracts with trading firms, book publishers and 
others companies under which society members received discounts 
and benefits. Some military-economic societies created mutual 
aid associations that supported the families of those who had 
perished or died of war injuries. 
  The next stage in the development of the military-economic 
movement was the emergence of associations whose aim was to 
develop military sciences, equipment, and industry. The best 
known of them was an engineer officers group that was 
subsequently known as the Military Personnel Society and later 
the Military Science Enthusiasts Society. 
  All the societies consisted of subscribers (for one-year 
periods or for life). In some places officers had share-holder 
rights. One could also point out that in 1894 all men of the 
czar's family -- 14 people in all -- were members of the 
Economic Society of Guards Corps Officers. 
  Members and life-long subscribers received dividends from 
profits based on the shares they owned and enjoyed a cash 
premium in proportion to purchases made in the society. The 
latter benefit was also enjoyed by one-year subscribers. Many 
societies had a very large cash turnover. For example, the 
Guards Economic Society increased its turnover from 10.5 million 
rubles to 1899 to 23 million rubles in 1908. Three-quarters of 
this money came from trade and cash and securities transactions. 
  How was initial capital acquired? From society members' 
shares and contributions, subscriber fees, loans and credits, 
profits from the societies' own activities, from interest earned 
on securities, deposits, and loans, and from voluntary 
contributions. It should be pointed out that considerable sums 
of money from centralized sources, as we would say today, were 
appropriated to support their activities. For example, the czar 
built several buildings, including the current Central Military 
Department Store, and donated them to the Moscow 
Military-Economic Society. 
  Other facts also attest to the attention the state devoted 
to 
these structures. For example, the fact that military-economic 
societies were created with the consent and agreement of the 
government. The charters of all societies were approved by the 
defense minister or by one of his deputies. The defense minister 
was to be notified whenever a society ceased operations, after 
which an appropriate order was issued in the district concerned. 
  And now it can be said that a revival of military-economic 
societies has finally begun in Russia. One such structure arose 
last year, thanks to the efforts of military and civilian 
economists, political scientists, and legal specialists; it was 
registered with the Russian Ministry of Justice on March 22 as 
the Military-Economic Society. This was followed by the creation 
of the Russian Economic Society of Reservists. The 
organizations' main goals and tasks have to do mainly with 
pooling the efforts of reserve servicemen and officers to 
protect their interests in the privatization process, improving 
their living conditions, promoting the country's economic 
recovery, and increasing the effectiveness of military reform 
and the conversion of military production. More than 50 regional 
organizations have been created in the past three months, just 
recently by the Air Defense Forces reserve officers at Sergiyev 
Posad, and preparations are being made for a founding conference 
at the Plesetsk space facility. 
  Acquiring initial working capital is a serious problem for 
officer economic societies. For such large regional centers as 
Saratov-Conversion, which has an annual turnover of almost a 
billion rubles, that stage is already past. That society's 
members have found mutually advantageous forms of cooperation 
with local government agencies and with dozens of enterprises in 
neighboring oblasts, proposing modern technologies, deliveries 
on favorable terms, and interesting projects. Others are only 
just forming their operating capital. Membership dues, as a 
rule, range from the cost of a monthly food ration to 100,000 
rubles. Some use monies from mutual aid funds. And officers at 
an aviation garrison in Tver Oblast contributed a million rubles 
each from the retirement benefits they received upon discharge. 
  What are the resulting benefits for servicemen, workers, 
office employees, and those who have already been discharged 
into the reserves? Society members can buy consumer goods and 
food products at prices just seven to 10 percent above 
enterprises' release prices, while prices are marked up 29 
percent for those who have not bought shares. That is still 
cheaper than in military stores, which have to maintain sizable 
staffs, warehouses, and other facilities and which in some areas 
have set prices that are even higher than those in commercial 
stores. Military-economic societies that have direct ties with 
suppliers pay only for the labor of the reserve officers and 
family members of the servicemen directly involved in the work. 
The new structures are not in a position to supplant military 
trade at the current stage, but they can already stimulate 
healthy competition in providing trade services to garrisons. 
  The Russian Economic Society of Reservists already has land 
allocations in a number of parts of the country, has concluded 
agreements with leading construction and design organizations, 
and is prepared to start building apartments for reserve 
officers. Several multi-unit apartment buildings are now ready 
for tenants. The apartment prices will be 10 to 12 percent below 
the Defense Ministry's cost, and oversight will be more 
reliable, since the society members who lack apartments have an 
interest in this. The next move is up to the government, which 
has promised to appropriate sizable amounts of money to local 
administrations for this purpose; it will be important to ensure 
that the funds are not wasted the way they were last year. 
  Military-economic societies have also asked the government 
to 
eliminate the unequal situation of servicemen vis-a-vis labor 
collective members in voucher privatization. The gist of their 
proposals is that reserve servicemen and officers be allowed to 
buy surplus Defense Ministry property and real estate at 1991 
prices and that reserve officer economic societies be allowed to 
operate as (confidential) trusts or lease on favorable terms 
various repair enterprises, shops, and workshops, as well as to 
lease equipment and other materials. 
  The Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the 
Use of Mineral Resources, in conjunction with the 
Military-Economic Society, is currently devising programs to 
reclaim lands vacated by the Armed Forces and to use them as 
farmland. 
  There is no question that many of these efforts could be 
slowed or blocked if military-economic societies fail to receive 
psychological and material support from the government and the 
Defense Ministry. One would like to believe that this won't 
happen, that the more than 150-year experience of similar 
organizations in many European countries will be taken into 
account (societies are currently operating successfully in 
Germany, Italy, Turkey, and other countries) and that the basis 
already established in our country will be revived in a new 
form. But this does not mean leaving people to deal with their 
problems on their own; we must simply foster conditions that 
will make it possible to use the enormous potential of 
servicemen, and above all reservists, in efforts to solve the 
most urgent social problems.

Administration: "Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
Collegium Discusses Conscription Problems"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Minister, General of 
the Army Pavel Grachev, held an expanded session of the Russian 
Defense Ministry Collegium on March 26 to discuss the results of 
the fall 1993 conscription of citizens for military service in 
the Armed Forces and measures to improve the work of military 
commissariats. The collegium session was attended by officials 
of the president's administration, the government, the Russian 
Procuracy, military district and fleet troop commanders, and 
military commissars from a number of Russian oblasts. 
  The session participants said that the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces General Staff, military district commands and 
staffs, and military commissariats, in conjunction with chief 
administrators, had made strong efforts to support the fall 1993 
conscription of citizens for military service and manpower 
acquisition for the Russian Federation Armed Forces. Despite the 
measures taken, however, the military conscription target was 
not met completely. This was the result of a number of factors, 
including the continuing increase in the number of instances of 
evasion of military service. 
  In order to carry out the conscription of citizens for 
military service and manpower acquisition programs for the Armed 
Forces in 1994 in a well-organized fashion, collegium members 
adopted a decision to request the Russian Federation government 
to accelerate the process of reviewing and confirming statutes 
on military registration, military conscription, and medical 
examinations for military conscripts and a schedule of rated 
military specializations. The Defense Ministry Collegium also 
resolved to make every effort to ensure the high-quality 
selection and recruitment of citizens for contract military 
service in accordance with established targets and to fill all 
warrant officer vacancies in the Army and Navy. The session 
participants called attention to the need to enlist as many 
representatives of labor collectives, educational institutions, 
and public organizations as possible in work with conscripts 
during the spring conscription campaign.

Lieutenant General of Justice Nosov: 'There Are Many Violations 
in the Higher Military Echelons Connected with Illegal 
Commercial Activity'"] 
  [Text] While independence may be detrimental to some, 
apparently, it is clearly beneficial to the Military Procuracy. 
It has been noted that the less the Main Directorate for 
Supervision of the Fulfillment of Laws in the Armed Forces (this 
is what the GVP [Main Military Procuracy] is now called) depends 
on these Armed Forces in a personnel and financial sense, the 
more efficient its activity becomes. 
  We asked Lieutenant General of Justice Grigoriy Nosov, first 
deputy chief of the main directorate, to talk about corruption 
and the nonfulfillment of laws and regulations in the Armed 
Forces: 
  [Kholodov] The GVP has been turned into a directorate of the 
General Procuracy with a long name that includes the phrase 
"supervision of the fulfillment of laws." It would be 
interesting to know how you do this, given the existing chaos in 
the legislative system of the country? 
  [Nosov] Our practical experience has shown that the problem 
of the fulfillment of laws, to put it mildly, has not been 
resolved. Military procurators have exposed more than 12,000 
violations of legislation. On our protests, about 1,800 illegal 
orders and other acts of the command authorities were canceled. 
More than 13,000 officials were made financially liable. But the 
adoption of a package of military laws was a big step. 
Previously many aspects of military activity generally were 
regulated only by orders and directives of the Ministry of 
Defense. Unfortunately, under existing laws, the procedure for 
their implementation has not been worked out in many ways. Up to 
the present time, the subordinate legal acts necessary for this 
have not been adopted. The situation is unprecedented for us as 
well: The Military Procuracy is not mentioned at all in the Law 
on the Procuracy of the Russian Federation. 
  [Kholodov] You are outside the law? 
  [Nosov] We were previously locked into the Union Procuracy. 
Then the Russian Procuracy took us under its jurisdiction. There 
is only an outdated 1981 decree on military procurators, and we 
are compelled each year to confirm our existence with special 
normative acts of the president and parliament. 
  [Kholodov] Does the Military Procuracy frequently protest 
the 
orders of higher military officials? 
  [Nosov] We conduct supervision over the fulfillment of laws, 
including also by senior officials up to and including the 
minister of defense and his deputies. In 1993 we protested 27 
orders of the minister and his deputies. In 1992 there were 19 
such protests. 
  [Kholodov] What kind of laws are most frequently violated by 
this contingent of servicemen? 
  [Nosov] For example, the order on the promotion of Dmitriy 
Yakubovskiy to the rank of major of justice. The directive of 
the commanding general of the Internal Troops of the MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the Russian Federation that 
prohibited the allocation of housing to unmarried officers and 
warrant officers. The instruction of a deputy of the Ministry of 
Defense that authorized the discharge of officers without 
granting housing was protested. 
  If we are talking in general about violations of laws in the 
higher echelons, there are enough of them. There are especially 
many in the assignment of housing. In the North Caucasus 
Military District, on the verbal instructions of General 
Netkachev, the commander of a large unit, apartments were given 
to his deputies out of turn--to Generals Kulakov and Artemov. 
  [Kholodov] Apartments, of course, are a very important issue 
for officers. But in the army cases of corruption are treated 
with extreme sensitivity, especially those among the senior 
command personnel. Are the military procurators conducting any 
kind of work in this direction? 
  [Nosov] Many violations in the upper echelons are associated 
with illegal commercial activity that is forbidden in the army. 
Just as a result of inspections in the central apparatus of the 
Ministry of Defense by forces of the main directorate, 
reimbursement was made for damages in the sum of about 16 
billion rubles [R]. Ten criminal cases were instituted. In 
particular, under Article 260, clause a, of the Criminal Code of 
the Russian Federation, with respect to Colonel General of 
Aviation Pavlov, commander of Aviation of the Ground Troops, and 
Generals Lukashev and Vorobyev, who are subordinate to him, who 
committed abuses in the sale of military aviation equipment that 
resulted in a large financial loss to the state. In the 
interests of the investigation, I cannot say more. There are 
many cases of servicemen working in commercial structures, 
holding staff positions, receiving money. This does not lead to 
anything good. The military are not businessmen but officials. 
  [Kholodov] We literally receive streams of complaints from 
officers here at MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. Do servicemen turn to 
you? 
  [Nosov] There are many complaints. Last year about 12,000 of 
them came to the organs of the Procuracy. We check them out, and 
institute criminal cases in some of them. For example, a 
criminal case was instituted in January under Article 260, 
clause a, regarding Major General Baskayev (commander of the 
Internal Troops of the Moscow District). On Baskayev's 
instructions, Colonel Trofimov, commander of an Internal Troops 
subunit, concluded a contract with a certain commercial 
organization to guard with Internal Troops forces a building 
that was under construction. This company assumed the obligation 
of allocating dwelling space in this building to servicemen as 
payment for the guard duty. It turned out that this company was 
not the owner of the housing. As a result, housing was not 
allocated to them. Then servicemen of the Internal Troops 
blockaded the building. The apartments had already been 
distributed among civilians. With the employment of special 
means of the forces of the Internal Troops, the legal owners 
were evicted from the apartments and servicemen of the Internal 
Troops and other persons who were absolute outsiders were 
settled in them. In addition, damage was done to the property of 
citizens in a sum of more than R272 million, and to an 
enterprise associated with this building in a sum of R64 
million. Proceedings were instituted on the charge of 
arbitrariness by the commanding general. 
  [Kholodov] Commercialization in the army is terrible in that 
arsenals are becoming empty. Are a lot of arms stolen in the 
Russian Armed Forces? 
  [Nosov] In recent years the number of thefts has increased 
by 
a factor of 25. While in 1987-1988 a little more than 100 units 
were stolen, now this is thousands of gunbarrels. All told last 
year military procurators investigated 317 cases concerning 
theft of arms and ammunition. 
  [Kholodov] Where is the most stealing? 
  [Nosov] In military units deployed in "hot spots." Most of 
all in the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. On 25 
April 1993 there, for example, 44 armored assault vehicles were 
stolen: About 60 armed militants [Mkhedrioni] broke into the 
territory of a military unit in Kutaisi. It is interesting that 
while previously the objects of theft were pistols and rifles, 
frequently for hunting, now it is grenades and machine guns. 
Last year two sailors of the Baltic Fleet stole a PZRK [portable 
SAM] Strela-2. 
  [Kholodov] Indispensable for hunting... 
  [Nosov] They were arrested while attempting to sell it for 
$40,000. Since September of 1993 a private and a junior sergeant 
had removed six Igla SAM's from a depot and were selling them to 
Lithuanian citizens--this also occurred in the Baltic Fleet. In 
October 1993 in the Leningrad Military District, Warrant Officer 
Ismailov stole seven 23-millimeter rapid-fire antiaircraft guns! 
  [Kholodov] And the last question. We have hardly talked 
about 
hazing of new conscripts for some time. There seems to be a 
reserve of trust in the current Ministry of Defense. Now, it 
seems, telephone calls and letters have literally burst forth... 
I would like to hear the statistics on such crimes that are 
available to the Military Procuracy. 
  [Nosov] You can see a reduction in crimes of this nature by 
14.6 percent in comparison with 1992. During all 1993 for all 
troops, 1,287 hazing crimes were recorded. But this is "clean 
hazing," and its importance in the total number of military 
crimes is less than 5 percent. 
  [Kholodov] Is there "dirty hazing"? 
  [Nosov] That is to say, "clean hazing" implies nonregulation 
mutual relations among servicemen that are not in relations of 
subordination or seniority with respect to one another. The 
number of these crimes does not include, for example, assault 
and battery by commanders. 
  In the last year we concluded the investigation of 1,942 
criminal cases of nonregulation mutual relations. About 80 
percent of these were sent to court. [end Nosov] 
  It is difficult to oversee laws in a state where there 
are none, or where they contradict one another. Nevertheless, 
the Procuracy is obligated to be impartial. But whether the 
Procuracy is earning its keep is for you, taxpayers, to 
judge.

<F P=106> [Sergey Ovsiyenko report: "`Quiet' Send-off for Russian </F>
Troops From Germany. Official Bonn Insists on It"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Soviet and Russian troops have been on 
German territory for almost half a century. Our last soldier 
will leave the now-united country 31 August this year, and a 
major military grouping that had once been abroad will return 
home. 
  Many Western politicians, particularly in the FRG, are 
calling this a historic event, linking it to the end of the 
"Cold War." And they are right. Units of what was then the 
Group of Soviet Forces in Germany took part in the Berlin events 
of 1953 and 1961, went into Prague in August 1968.... 
  At the same time, the almost 50-year presence of this 
military grouping in central Europe has been a deterrent. The 
same politicians are right to link peace on the European 
continent with the presence in Germany of the Western Group of 
Forces [WGF].... 
  Thus, a dignified withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany 
is a matter of prestige for our country which enhances still 
further its authority in Europe and the world (particularly 
following our diplomatic successes in Yugoslavia). 
  Speaking at a Berlin press conference at the end of last 
year, Colonel General M. Burlakov, commander in chief of the 
WGF, made public the Russian proposals for the ceremonial 
send-off, which, as he put it, had been submitted to the Russian 
president. They included two stages -- April-May (memorial to 
our fallen servicemen) and August (ceremonial assembly in Berlin 
of an honor guard made up of Russian and allied troops and the 
Bundeswehr, a march, a ceremonial Reichstag session with the 
participation of the two states' leaders, and a "roundtable" for 
World War II veterans).... 
  The commander-in-chief then advised that the German 
leadership had not reacted in any way to these proposals, which 
had previously been conveyed to the German side. 
  Last March I talked with Defense Minister Army General P. 
Grachev. Holding talks with his colleague (FRG Defense Minister 
V. Ruehe) he noted that the question of the send-off ceremony 
for the Russian troops comes under the jurisdiction of the two 
leaders -- President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl. 
  Until recently official Bonn in its discussion of the 
Russian 
troop send-off had restricted itself to bland diplomatic 
formulas. The Berlin Senate was quite definite and did not 
indulge in any diplomatic equivocation in insisting on separate 
send-offs for the Russian and allied troops -- from the United 
States, Britain, and France. Although the last WGF soldier will 
leave Germany "quietly" 31 August, the allies can expect a 
triumphant send-off in Berlin in early September. 
  The Berlin Senate's statement began to feature in the FRG 
newspapers, and was disseminated, with some confusion, by world 
news agencies.... 
  An attempt was being made for the umpteenth time to put 
Russia in its place and silence it. And by whom -- the Berlin 
Senate! Was it right to resolve on behalf of the federal 
government political problems that are of European and world 
rather than municipal importance?... 
  Unfortunately, the Russian Foreign Ministry, our Bonn 
Embassy, and its Berlin office failed to react at all to the 
Berlin Senate's move. As subsequent events were to show, this 
was wrong. 
  At a Bonn press conference in late March Chancellor Kohl 
voiced his version (now the official version) of the allied 
troops' send-off from Germany. It differs little from the 
Senate version. The French Foreign Ministry, by insisting on a 
parade, forced Bonn to abandon its intention to give the allied 
troops a modest send-off from Berlin. 
  Now the chancellor has promised our World War II allies a 
triumphant send-off ceremony with a military parade, banners, 
and music.... 
  Explaining this sudden decision, H. Kohl stated that it was 
the logical conclusion to the stormy debates about the send-off 
to be given to the allied troops who had for 50 years guaranteed 
the preservation of the status of West Berlin.... 
  What about the Russian troops? Bonn is insisting on a 
"quiet" send-off far from Berlin, at WGF Headquarters in 
Wuensdorf. Whereas the allied send-off will end, for instance, 
with a ceremony of mourning at the Brandenburg Gates, no such 
ceremony is envisaged for the Russian troops. 
  I would recall that in the Berlin Operation our forces lost 
over 300,000 men. And it would be blasphemous not to pay our 
respects to them one last time. 
  The German capital is going further in its division into 
worthy and less worthy. The allied ceremony on 8 September will 
be addressed by Presidents Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand, 
and by Prime Minister John Major. The Russian president and the 
federal chancellor will speak 31 August at the memorial to the 
Soviet troops in Treptow. 
  ...Europe is no longer the way it was in the fifties and 
sixties, at the height of the "Cold War." There will be no 
return to a past which brought the peoples to the brink of a 
dangerous confrontation. History cannot be rewritten to suit 
short-term interests. People are in agreement on that in both 
East and West. 
  But, on the other hand, how can we understand the Bonn 
authorities' decision to have separate send-off ceremonies for 
the World War II allies, dividing them into worthy and unworthy, 
and essentially revising this same history?

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of </F>
general staff of the Russian Federation Armed Forces: "Problems 
of Flanks and Future of Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] It will soon be two years since the Treaty on 
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) entered into force, 
laying the foundation to real disarmament in Europe. The 
results of the first stage of the treaty's implementation attest 
graphically to the serious attitude of the Russian Federation 
and other signatory states to the fulfillment of the commitments 
they have undertaken. As of 15 April 1994 some 7,886 tanks, 
over 9,300 armored combat vehicles, and 3,458 artillery systems, 
about 900 combat aircraft and 240 strike helicopters had been 
reduced in Europe. Of this quantity Russia had reduced 5,155 
weapons and items of equipment (about one quarter). 
  All this confirms the treaty's vitality. At the same time 
new political and military-strategic realities which have now 
taken shape in Europe and the world demand a certain adaptation 
of its positions to the situation's present conditions. 
  Let us recall that the treaty was elaborated under the 
conditions of fierce antagonism between the two systems and 
their confrontation and the armed opposition of military blocs 
-- the Warsaw Pact and NATO. It is not surprising that it 
included provisions on the regional division and flank 
restrictions of weapons and equipment. 
  The main idea of the treaty with regard to regional division 
was to reduce the dangerous concentration of arms on the line 
where the groupings of the Warsaw Pact and NATO armed forces 
were in contact, primarily in Central Europe, and also to 
restrict the quantity of arms in the region next to Central 
Europe, known as "expanded Central Europe." In accordance with 
this idea the regions' borders were determined. For the 
majority of countries they coincided with state borders. But 
for the USSR, considering the size of its territory and the 
contours of its regions, these borders were determined by the 
borders of the military districts. 
  As a whole, the principle of regional division enshrined in 
the treaty and providing for the "decanting" of weapons from the 
line of contact to deep positions (the so-called "lock gate" 
principle) under the conditions of confrontation between the two 
blocs justified itself. Similar aims were served by the 
establishment of strictly fixed and relatively low levels of 
weapons for the flank regions and also the restriction on depot 
stocks of arms here. 
  At the time for the Soviet Union -- a single state with 
powerful armed forces -- the limitation on flank forces 
determined by the CFE treaty was acceptable. It ensured the 
USSR the building of a reliable defense both in the North and in 
the South. But with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the 
Soviet Union the military-political situation in Europe changed 
drastically. Some of the treaty's provisions were 
correspondingly in need of certain amendments. Some of these 
amendments have been made. The territory of the three Baltic 
states (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) was excluded from the 
treaty's region of operation. Russia, Belorussia [Belarus], 
Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldavia [Moldova], and 
Kazakhstan became the USSR's successors as signatories of the 
CFE Treaty. Overall, arms levels established for the Soviet 
Union and regional levels were shared among them. Here the 
flank water level was shared only between six successor-states 
(Belorussia and Kazakhstan are not in the flank region). 
  If at the time it was signed the treaty set a specific 
balance of regional forces, then with the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the redistribution of its levels among the independent 
states that arose on its basis, this balance was violated. It 
was for that reason that the flank problem arose for Russia. 
Its thrust is as follows. 
  First, under the CFE Treaty the Soviet Union in the flank 
region including the Leningrad Military District, the North 
Caucasus Military District, the Transcaucasus Military District, 
and the Odessa Military District, had the right to deploy 1,850 
tanks and 1,800 armored vehicles, and 2,776 artillery systems 
with a caliber of 100 mm and above. But after the distribution 
of the arms allowed in this region between the states which were 
the USSR's successors, Russia acquired the right to have in 
regular units on its flanks (the Leningrad Military District and 
the North Caucasus Military District) just 700 tanks, 580 
armored vehicles, and 1,280 artillery systems. Considering that 
these two districts occupy over half Russia's European territory 
and considering their geopolitical importance, these levels are 
obviously inadequate for the Russian Armed forces for creating a 
defense grouping. Essentially conditions have arisen in which 
the troops in these districts must manage without the necessary 
quantity of heavy weapons. And I think there is no need to 
explain what an army is without modern weapons. It must also be 
considered that the levels authorized by the treaty include 
weapons and equipment not only of the Leningrad and North 
Caucasus military districts but also of some naval components -- 
the coastal defense and marine forces which perform specific 
functions. These restrictions also include tanks and armored 
combat vehicles at repair enterprises -- and they come here from 
virtually the entire territory of Russia. Considering all this 
it is not hard to conclude that the personnel of our ground 
forces units deployed in the flank region could remain virtually 
without armored cover and defense. 
  Second, the redistribution of the commitments of the former 
USSR has entailed a fundamental change in the correlation of 
arms levels stemming from the treaty for Russia in the region of 
"expanded Central Europe" and in the "flank region." As a 
result, of the overall level for the Russian Federation (6,400 
tanks, 11,480 armored combat vehicles, and 6,415 artillery 
systems), in the regular units on the territory of Kaliningrad 
Oblast (in all 15,000 square kilometers or less than 0.5 percent 
of the European part of Russia) six times more tanks and 15 
times more armored combat vehicles can be deployed than in the 
entire flank region (Leningrad Military District and North 
Caucasus Military District taken together). 
  That means that the flank restrictions push Russia toward 
concentrating its conventional armed forces on the territory of 
Kaliningrad Oblast and along the borders with Belorussia and 
Ukraine. Essentially this leads to the restoration of the 
confrontation of Cold War times along the West-East line, which 
runs counter to the treaty's aims and to Europe's desire to 
create a new security system. 
  The situation which is taking shape is strange, to put it 
mildly. The conservation of the flank restrictions structure 
determined by the treaty leads to a situation where some people 
can in the interests of national security deploy troops where 
they consider it necessary while others cannot. Here the 
discriminatory orientation of this provision is manifested only 
with regard to Russia and Ukraine. It is these two states which 
cannot deploy their armed forces on their national territory as 
they see fit. Thus the treaty's provisions on flank 
restrictions, which do not accord with present-day realities, 
essentially reinforce the position of Russia and Ukraine, which 
does not give them the same rights as other signatories. The 
real interests of these two states' security under present 
conditions are not considered. 
  For Russia the state of affairs is further aggravated by the 
fact that in the very near future the withdrawal of troops from 
the territory of Germany and also from the Baltic countries, the 
Dniester region, and other regions of the former USSR is to be 
completed. The tough framework of the flank restrictions 
compels us to withdraw the troops either to the territory of the 
Moscow Military District, where the troop level has reached the 
limit, or to the rear region -- the Volga and Ural military 
districts, where the relevant infrastructure does not exist. 
And that when conditions are more suitable in Pskov, Novgorod, 
and Vologda Oblasts, for instance, which belong to the Leningrad 
Military District, and in the North Caucasus Military District. 
  Third, considering the geopolitical changes which have 
occurred in the post-Soviet area, the concept of flanks itself 
has also changed. This has affected most of all the southern 
part of Russia's flank region. Previously, before the treaty 
was signed, the North Caucasus Military District was seen in the 
USSR Armed Forces as a rear region. This was correspondingly 
reflected in the district's tasks, its structure, staffing, and 
the direction of its training. The situation has now changed 
drastically -- the district has become a border one. 
  We must also consider the overall situation which has taken 
shape in this direction. The situation here remains 
exceptionally tense, which requires an adequate military 
presence from Russia. That is important not only from the 
viewpoint of ensuring internal security but also for the 
stabilization of the situation in Europe as a whole. Of course 
we rule out Russian military intervention in the internal 
affairs of the states of these regions but it is after all 
possible that Russian Armed Forces formations will be brought in 
to conduct operations to restore and maintain peace, naturally 
with a consideration for our domestic legislation and 
international law. 
  Fourth, the flank restrictions cause serious complications 
of 
an economic and social nature for Russia. As has already been 
noted, we are continuing the withdrawal of troops from the 
territory of other states. These troops are deployed in regions 
where more favorable conditions exist. The erection of the 
necessary establishments for the troops in new, undeveloped 
places given the present state of the Russian economy is a task 
beyond our state's powers. 
  A special place here for all our other commitments is 
occupied by the social aspects of the problem. Behind all the 
figures and plans for structural changes and movements of troops 
in accordance with the military reform and the fulfillment of 
the CFE Treaty commitments there stand living people -- officers 
and ensigns with their families and personnel on compulsory 
service. Concern for them is our duty and sacred obligation. 
  Thus the military, economic, and sociopolitical aspects of 
the problem connected with flank restrictions have acquired an 
exceptionally acute nature for Russia. They directly affect the 
interests of the state's security. 
  As we know, the right to choose one's own ways of ensuring 
security and guarantees of security is one inalienable element 
of state sovereignty. We can see clearly enough how this right 
looks for Russia in the context of the flank restrictions 
stemming from the CFE Treaty. It is perfectly obvious that with 
the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the USSR and 
the formation of new independent states on its territory these 
restrictions have lost their political and [passage illegible]. 
That is why the Russian Federation is so persistently raising 
the question of resolving the problem of flank restrictions in a 
way acceptable to all the treaty's signatories. 
  In September last year Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin sent the heads of state and government of a number of 
CFE Treaty signatory countries a special message clearly setting 
forth our position on the flanks problem. Following this the 
Russian delegation submitted in the Joint Consultative Group 
(created with a view to promoting the implementation of the CFE 
Treaty) the proposal to suspend the operation of the treaty's 
article concerning flank restrictions and to embark on a joint 
search of ways of resolving the problem. Other possible 
measures were also set forth. 
  The representatives of the majority of the treaty's 
signatory 
states express understanding for our concerns. But they are 
going no further than noting this and are continuing to insist 
that the treaty be kept unchanged. Their main argument is that 
the introduction of any amendment to the treaty will cause "a 
chain reaction" of amendments as a result of which it will 
allegedly cease to work. 
  In our view the treaty could be overturned not by an 
"avalanche" of amendments and amplifications but by the 
increasingly obvious contradiction between its individual 
provisions and the new situation. It is here that we see the 
real danger to the fate of the treaty. Unless steps are taken 
promptly to adapt it to modern conditions and the relevant 
amendments are made -- amendments dictated by the course of life 
itself -- then the treaty [passage illegible]. Unfortunately, 
in response we hear only general arguments about the treaty's 
unshakable, balanced nature, and its importance for the aims of 
pan-European security. But for some reason no specific 
proposals are to be heard for resolving the problem which has 
arisen. 
  It is perfectly obvious that we cannot delay a decision 
until 
later. We need complete clarity right now to choose the optimum 
defense potential configuration for Russia and to prepare the 
relevant infrastructure for the provision of amenities for the 
troops. The progress of military reform and the rates of 
withdrawal of Russian troops to national territory and other 
very important aspects of the Russian Federation armed forces' 
activity and organizational development. 
  Russia remains a convinced support of the CFE Treaty and is 
conscientiously fulfilling all its commitments. Just as we are 
reducing conventional weapons and equipment so we shall reduce 
them until we reach the maximum levels set for Russia. Just as 
we accept inspections to monitor the treaty's fulfillment so in 
the future we shall promote the monitoring in full. At the same 
time we count on the mutual understanding of our partners in the 
treaty in the search for a solution to the flanks problem. 
  Here we are also firmly convinced that deploying troops on 
its own territory in accordance with the state's views of the 
tasks of defense and the safeguarding of its own security 
interests is the inalienable right of every sovereign state. It 
contradicts neither the terms of the treaty nor article 51 of 
the UN Charter.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kandryshev: "`Ruslans' for Grachev"] </F>
  [Text] During a recent visit to the Aviastar Aircraft 
Construction Plant in Ulyanovsk, admiring the An-124 Ruslan 
heavy air transports in the assembly shop, Minister of Defense 
P. Grachev asked the generals escorting him: "How many of these 
aircraft do we need?" 
  The generals did not think long: "100." 
  Of course, being used to the principle of "ask for more, 
they 
will give you less," the generals overstated the number. 
  Nevertheless, P. Grachev promised the Ulyanovsk aircraft 
builders to order a dozen Ruslans for the quick response 
forces. But for an enterprise that is experiencing 
difficulties today marketing the Ruslan, even such a 
compartively small order would be a blessing. 
  In this regard, it is appropriate to recall that the An-124 
aircraft was created specifically for quick-response operations 
of a global nature for timely airlifting of heavy armament. 
Incidentally, when the Ruslan was being developed and put into 
production, the Afghan campaign was in full swing, and D. 
Ustinov, the minister of defense at that time, is considered the 
"godfather" of this aircraft. 
  Only the events of recent years, the temporary refusal of 
the 
Ministry of Defense--the sole customer--to purchase An-124 
aircraft made it possible to create the civilian Volga-Dnieper 
Air Transport Company, which operates aircraft with the largest 
carrying capacity and which gained world notoriety by 
transporting unique cargo on Ruslan aircraft. 
  Grachev's plan to order An-124 transport aircraft for quick 
response not only confirms the thoughts expressed by I. 
Serebryakov in the article "Russia's Military Doctrine" 
(NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, No 8, 1994) but also expands them in that 
the Ministry of Defense, possibly, is going the way of creating 
quick response forces of unspecified, but apparently sizable, 
numerical strength. 
  As we know, the missions of quick response forces are 
basically punitive in nature, unlike deterrence forces. 
  But since use of quick response forces outside the CIS is 
fraught with a corresponding reaction by public opinion both 
within and outside Russia, as well as other consequences, it is 
natural to ask: Why are quick response forces being created that 
are equipped with heavy armament, for the airlift of which the 
Ministry of Defense plans to order the mighty Ruslans?

<F P=106> [Article by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA military columnist Sergey </F>
Doronin: "The Commander-in-Chief's Word of Honor"] 
  [Text] I caught sight of the blip from the NATO Orion 
ASW aircraft on the air situation plot in the Kola Air Defense 
Zone command post at 0849 on 31 March. Keeping a distance of 50 
km from our shore, it was completing a turn onto the reverse 
course, from Cape Svyatoy Nos to North Cape, so as to return in 
30-40 minutes. The friends in the partnership for peace were 
working in the previous manner... 
  Navymen dislike Orions. Crews of surface ships dislike them 
because they are impudent. Not only will they fly around the 
ship, but they also will not fail to roar over superstructures. 
Crews of strategic submarines departing on patrol duty dislike 
them because the sonobuoys scattered by an Orion will transmit 
the submarine's characteristic noises to the aircraft with 
almost one-hundred percent certainty. The noises later will be 
loaded into the computer programs of controllable mine ordnance. 
In a threat period, such weapons are laid covertly off exits 
from bases. You can be sure they will operate only against you. 
  Several years ago such actions evoked a response. Air 
defense 
aviation alert forces would be sent up with one mission: Hamper 
reconnaissance by all possible methods but one -- destruction. 
  One such alert mission almost ended in tragedy. An SU-27 
which had hovered over an Orion fell into the propellers, but 
evidently it pleased God not to allow a great misfortune that 
day. Both our fighter and the foreign reconnaissance aircraft 
made it to their airfields. Well, I don't know about the 
Americans, but our ace later got it pretty good. He was saved 
from the anger of higher-ups only by one thing: What was then 
still a Soviet nuclear powered submarine slipped unnoticed into 
the Barents Sea in this commotion. 
  Today "force majeure" circumstances are evaluated somewhat 
differently -- from the standpoint of the ability of combat 
teams to adequately analyze the behavior of the tracked target 
and forecast its ultimate goals. 
  Previous methods of "bolt-rattling" -- stopping a flight or 
forcing a landing -- have been rescinded. This probably is 
correct. The world has become largely different. 
  As a rule, yesterday's potential enemy is not behaving as 
energetically, although he is not letting up in reconnaissance 
activeness. Last year 179 Orion flights were registered in the 
Barents Sea, and there already have been 52 in three months of 
this year. 
  "So you see for yourself," said Lieutenant General Aleksey 
Marenkov, air defense corps commander, commenting on this fact, 
"that while politicians seem to be getting friendly, the 
military do not forget their purpose." 
  By the way, it is not just aircraft of contiguous states of 
Finland and Norway that operate actively near Russian borders. 
It turns out the Americans also have interests in the Russian 
North and are invariable participants of the various "air 
shows." Not a year goes by that the British and French do not 
drop in to train in detecting our subs from the air. 
  Pilots of private light-engine aircraft and helicopters also 
are no less trouble. The specialists with whom I had occasion to 
chat are far from categorizing all of them as followers of the 
not unknown Mathias Rust, but there are so many who deliberately 
get on the nerves of duty air defense weapon teams. Sometimes 
fighter-interceptors must be scrambled and additional airspace 
surveillance and tracking systems must be started up. All this 
means expenditures, and no small ones: Just one liter of 
aviation kerosene costs R280 today. And filling an aircraft 
takes much more than ten tonnes. 
  Meanwhile, fighter regiments have difficulty keeping fuel 
reserves at the 30-50 percent level. This is an average for the 
troops. In the first quarter the Kilpyavr air regiment near 
Murmansk was allocated only five percent of what was required. 
  The reason is not new -- Ministry of Defense inability to 
pay. Aviation kerosene, solar oil and gasoline are obtained by 
hook or by crook. Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov, 
commander-in-chief of the Russian Federation Air Defense Troops, 
recently got all this in Omsk on his word of honor. They 
believed him (regretting it for the umpteenth time!) and gave 
him 26,000 tonnes on credit. Counting what came before, it will 
be necessary to pay R11 billion for everything. 
  It is the very same picture with spare parts, but old ties 
far from always help out. More and more often, suppliants are 
treated indifferently: When there is prepayment, we'll talk... 
  I will not begin to accuse the heads of such enterprises of 
a 
lack of patriotism, because I know how difficult it is for them 
as well -- no money to develop production, nothing to pay 
workers. I ask only one thing: Do not nag those officers who 
turn to you for help. They themselves already have been serving 
on credit for a long time. Pay has been issued only for January 
in two air regiments which I had occasion to visit -- near St. 
Petersburg and Murmansk. Air defense missilemen guarding Kola 
Peninsula installations -- enterprises, the atomic electric 
power station at Polyarnyye Zori, Fleet garrisons and bases -- 
are in a similar situation. The state's debt for the Severomorsk 
formation's pay is around R600 million, and it is three billion 
for the large strategic formation at Arkhangelsk... 
  What is service without pay? Chancing to be in Murmansk 
recently, a missile regiment commander was unable to buy a stick 
of boiled sausage, which his wife had asked for the day before 
as she handed him the last R5,000 note that had been hidden away. 
  "You understand, I was ashamed to ask the saleswoman to cut 
off a piece, but for no more than 5,000..." 
  "I understand you, Lieutenant Colonel. The situation is 
morally repulsive. But who would explain something else to me: 
How, with whose concession, and for how much are streams with 
abundant fish leased on the sly in Murmansk Oblast? Who are 
they, these stern businessmen (would that they were only ours!)? 
Armed with Winchesters and assault rifles, they permit 
themselves to threaten the corps commander: "We don't give a 
damn, General, that you have equipment here on Rybachiy, that it 
has to be removed from here by ship. Clear out of here with a 
whole skin; this section of the peninsula is private property..." 
  Just quite recently service in the Arctic was considered 
prestigious. One year for one and one-half, one and one-half 
times the pay, arctic increments -- all this more than 
compensated for all sorts of inconveniences of life. Today for 
the most part it is zealots who inhabit the "norths," those for 
whom money will not cloud the eyes. Because no one pays either 
pilots or their families for clearing a snow-blocked runway. 
That is how they serve, together with the airfield soldiers and 
with the regimental commander. 
  You won't go from here to the "continent" for a replacement 
very often. There are fewer and fewer who wish to move to the 
Arctic, inasmuch as, having settled down in a more or less 
civilized place, people do not wish to leave it for fully 
understandable reasons. And you can't send them off under armed 
escort. 
  And what is to be done with residents of former garrisons 
such as of that same Novaya Zemlya? They removed the formation, 
but some of the people just remained there; there is nowhere to 
move to. Who will take the housing inventory on his balance 
sheet? How can acceptable everyday conditions be created for 
them and how can they be provided with work? Ministry of Defense 
personnel suffice only for a little bit -- to maintain the vital 
activity of a combat infrastructure mothballed for the time 
being. The idea was for the rest to have gone over to 
institutions of local government, but a government decision is 
needed for this. 
  And the people work. Each day the combat teams of SAM launch 
systems, radars and command posts and the pilots of air 
squadrons go on guard over Russia's air borders. To hell with 
the area's biorhythms and geographic and climatic features. 
Whether it be the South or Kamchatka, there is work, with a 
meaning that is simple and understandable -- protect the 
Motherland. If not we, then just who will do it?

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Basov: "Russia Needs a Navy -- But What </F>
Kind?"] 
  [Text] Having devoted more than forty years to 
naval service, I had mixed feelings when I read the article "We 
Must Save the Navy" in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. On its pages the 
paper raised a most urgent question which touches on the 
long-term vital interests of Russia. Once again I was convinced 
of the terrible situation (let us call a spade a spade) in which 
our navy has existed for the last two or three years, that same 
avy which for the first time in history had ranked second in the 
world in terms of power. The peoples of friendly countries on 
all continents welcomed ships flying the white and blue flag, 
and enemies treated it with respect on all the waters of the 
World Ocean. 
  The Deputy Chairman of Goskomoboronprom [State 
Committee of the Defense Industry] of the Russian Federation G. 
Voronin, straightforwardly and with facts in hand, sketched the 
rapid fading of our fleet and its dismal prospects. In five 
years the complement of the navy has been cut by 40 percent. For 
the second year not a single new ship has been started. The 
basing system has been destroyed, alert-duty service has been 
cut, the squadrons of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean 
have returned to their own coastal waters, some ship-building 
centers have broken away, and the financing of fundamental and 
exploratory research has stopped. Deprived of its navy, the 
country will inevitably lose its great-power status. 
  This prospect is dismal and ruinous for the state. Still, 
some estimates demand clarification, some predictions require 
discussion. 
  First of all I want to note that one can speak of the navy 
only with allowance for the geopolitical factor. In contrast to 
island states, England, Japan and (in a sense) the U.S., which 
does not have the million-strong armies of neighboring states 
nearby, Russia must first protect itself from the possible 
invasion of ground troops. Nor is invasion from naval axes ruled 
out. 
  As many now assume, world nuclear war is not very likely. 
But 
nuclear weapons will remain weapons of deterrence and prevention 
of aggression for many years yet. It is no secret that before 
the start of perestroyka, when no expense was spared 
on defense, the USSR put the emphasis in the nuclear triad on 
heavy ground-based missiles (ICBMs), which the U.S. most feared 
and which most met the geopolitical interests of our state. At 
that time it was easier and cheaper to form the Strategic 
Missile Troops than the Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces. 
  A change in the structure of strategic offensive arms to 
increase the naval component up to 50 to 70 percent, as G. 
Voronin proposes, will lead to another naval arms race. Voronin 
acknowledges that it would be unrealistic and inexpedient to try 
to achieve quantitative parity at sea given the great economic 
superiority of the U.S. Our country would not be able to breath 
freely under the burden of excessive military expenditures. He 
suggests concentrating strategic missile submarines and their 
supporting forces in the North and East as part of the Northern 
and Pacific Fleets. Allowing for the great economic importance 
of the Northern and Far-Eastern Seas, the author believes that 
"our navy must provide full superiority in these zones." 
Accomplishment of this task would require too many forces. 
However, temporary control over certain waters with the goal of 
blocking amphibious assaults, for example, is a realistic task. 
The new grouping of Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces also demands 
balance by conventional forces, to prevent skewing in the 
direction of any single weapons system. Forces to combat 
submarines, aircraft carriers, and other strike vessels are 
needed. All this requires an "air-defense umbrella." 
  Everyone remembers the Caribbean crisis of October 1962, 
when 
our forces in Cuba found themselves beyond the reach of Soviet 
conventional weapons and we were compelled to withdraw our 
missiles from Cuba literally under the muzzles of American guns. 
Thus in every theater, a complete structure of the present-day 
navy must be established. 
  So we must save the navy. To do this, the main forces of the 
navy must be concentrated in the North and Far East. What then 
of Russian interests in the Baltic and Black Seas? The U.S. has 
already announced that the Baltic countries and Ukraine are 
zones of their vital interests, and consequently they are 
prepared to defend them by force of arms. On March 19 of this 
year, on the "Vesti" [news] television show the new U.S. Defense 
Secretary W. Perry, allowing for the instability in Russia, 
spoke in favor of further development of nuclear forces, 
including the "Trident-2" sea-launched strategic missiles. 
Interest in the Baltic and Black Seas has also increased in 
other states. 
  Remember, however, that the appearance of a regular navy in 
Russia was prompted by an historical task, to penetrate the 
community of European states. Peter the First, after building 
St. Petersburg and creating the navy, had formed a great 
European power. Since then Russian has not been a guest in 
Europe, but an equal partner. Cooperation with European 
countries supported commercial and other interests in the 
Mediterranean. With the help of the navy dispatched from the 
Baltic, the Far East, Alaska, and Russian America were 
conquered. For Russia, remaining in the community of European 
states means having an army to protect it from possible invasion 
from the West and having freedom of navigation in the Baltic 
Sea. The latter must come from the small but combat-ready forces 
of the Baltic Feet. Here one must remember that during the Great 
Patriotic War, in the Northwest Strategic Axis the goals of the 
war were achieved through the joint efforts of the fronts, the 
navy, long-range aviation, and the National Air Defense Forces. 
  Russia's second geopolitical task has been and remains the 
furtherance of free trade of states at the crossroads of three 
continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. The annexation of the 
Crimea and the creation of the Black Sea Fleet met the needs of 
rapid development of the southern regions of the state. Rivalry 
with Turkey, England and France in this region led to wars, the 
demise of the fleet and its new restoration. Now the Near East 
is an enormous storehouse of oil. It is also a tangle of ethnic, 
religious and cultural contradictions, as was demonstrated by 
the Arab-Israel wars and the punitive operations against Iraq 
("Desert Storm"), effected from naval and ground axes. 
  For Russia, remaining a Black Sea power is an historical, 
unending task. How can it be achieved without reliance on the 
base system in the Crimea, after losing the ship-building 
capacity in the south of the former USSR? Clearly we must 
continue to look for new forms of cooperation with Ukraine and 
the other Black Sea states. 
  It has developed historically that in Russian foreign 
policy, 
Far-Eastern and Pacific problems derived from European-Atlantic 
problems. The flood of international capital into Southeast 
Asia, and in particular to China, led Russia to create the 
Pacific Fleet, and resulted in two wars with Japan. Now in this 
region the task clearly is not to "ensure full superiority" but 
to maintain a reasonable balance of forces between the U.S., 
Japan, China and Russia. According to reports from the SMI [not 
further expanded], all ship-building plants have stopped running 
in the Far East, and without them there can be neither military 
bases nor a fleet. 
  At present public opinion supports the idea of a need to 
create more mobile and better armed forces. In this we cannot 
help but allow for past experience. In the 20th century, Russia 
(the USSR) participated in two world wars without having 
concluded the formation of an ocean-going fleet. This made the 
"Russian front" very dependent on the status of the battle in 
the European-Atlantic and Asiatic-Pacific theaters of war. 
Retention of naval might exerted a great influence on the 
results of wars. In the period of the postwar confrontation and 
the "Cold War," the USSR constructed a powerful ocean-going 
fleet, but excessive military expenditures, including those for 
the fleet, were one of the causes of profound economic crisis. 
  We should support in every way the proposal of Gennadiy 
Voronin regarding the need to discuss the question of the navy 
before adopting a 10-to-15-year ship-building program and 
assigning the appropriations, not only in the Security Council 
but also in the Parliament. We need a Law on the Navy. The 
situation of the navy is so serious that perhaps its rescue 
should be started with the formation of an independent Ministry 
of the Navy.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Litkovets: "Environment and the Navy: </F>
Zolotoy Rog, Bay of Concern"] 
  [Text] A feud between the Vladivostok city government and 
the Pacific Fleet over the fuel base on the shore of Zolotoy Rog 
Bay has now gone on for more than 15 years. The city "doesn't 
like" its harmful effect on the environment. But without the 
only fuel base capable of fueling all classes of ships, the 
fleet will be half-paralyzed. 
  The storage tanks and production equipment of the Pacific 
Fleet's fuel storage facilities and bases recently marked their 
50th anniversary. Given their total lack of bilge and ballast 
water treatment stations, their effect on the environment is 
limited only by the service personnel's enthusiasm. Meanwhile, 
taking each tonne of oil-contaminated water to the civilian 
sailors' treatment facilities costs the fleet roughly 10,000 
rubles. This situation stems from the fact that financing for 
the construction of treatment facilities in 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy has been frozen at the level of two 
constructed tanks and the foundation for a boiler. And the 
Primorskiy Kray Environmental Protection Committee has banned 
the construction of a station in the vicinity of Vladivostok 
altogether. The committee's specialists maintain that the 
treatment facilities will be an additional source of pollution! 
But while demanding that the navy not pollute the environment, 
those same specialists have not impeded the operation of a 
seaport bilge and ballast water treatment station located next 
to the ill-fated Pacific Fleet fuel base or the construction of 
additional treatment units at a civilian fuel storage facility 
in the commercial seaport. Nor are Pacific Fleet ships capable 
of "making their way through" to those stations: The fishermen 
and civilian sailors already have more than enough ships of 
their own, and foreign ship owners pay hard currency to have 
their wastes treated. And yet the Navy is accused of being the 
sea's most active polluter. 
  Yes, some of the criticism of the Navy is justified. Its 
ships, with the exception of a few recently built ones, lack 
effective systems to treat bilge. Equipped only with tanks for 
fecal and waste water, they are forced to discharge it into the 
sea since the Fleet lacks treatment facilities of its own. But 
fewer than 15 percent of the ships and vessels based here belong 
to the Navy, and an even smaller percentage in terms of tonnage. 
If one takes into account the fact that, in addition to the 
sailors, 23 sewage pipes and all the city's industrial 
enterprises dump their waste water into the Zolotoy Rog bay 
without any treatment whatsoever, it becomes clear that the 
fleet is by no means the main "wrecker" of the environment. 
  But when our future and the future of our children are at 
stake, determining who has caused the most harm to that future 
is not the main concern. A glance at a map showing the extent to 
which areas of the sea around Vladivostok are contaminated with 
heavy metals is truly shocking: The maximum allowable 
concentrations have been exceeded many times over, in some 
instances by several orders of magnitude. And so we need to 
discuss not just how to stop the practice of discharging 
untreated wastes, but also how to clean up wastes that are 
already "rotting." Can this be done? 
  The Pacific Fleet, for example, has just 15 oil-spill 
cleanup 
ships, four of which are in Vladivostok, but only two are 
operable. And only one of them -- the MUS-342 -- is designed to 
skim petroleum product films from water surfaces. The others 
operate roughly like this: A man in an oil-stained padded jacket 
uses a pitchfork to scoop the waste from the water and toss it 
onto the deck. So the battle against environmental pollution at 
the current stage is for the most part haphazard. 
  "We proposed the establishment of a municipal office to 
clean 
waste and bilge from the water surface back in 1989," said 
Captain First Rank Aleksandr Nazarenko, chief of the Pacific 
Fleet environmental protection inspectorate. "After all, there 
are city services that collect household garbage, and something 
similar is needed on the water. But it turns out that nobody 
wants to take responsibility for the water, so there still isn't 
anyone in charge of protecting it from pollution caused by human 
economic activity." 
  Late last year a decision was adopted to assign a number of 
bays around Vladivostok to the city. And so now is the time to 
think about setting up a municipal enterprise to clean up those 
waters. And under these circumstances, in Aleksandr Nazarenko's 
opinion, the Fleet should move as quickly as possible to carry 
out an environmental field documentation of coastal military 
installations, use it as the basis for devising an environmental 
monitoring program, and make that program part of an integrated 
and centralized environmental protection system that would 
operate in conjunction with civilian agencies. A Pacific Fleet 
ecological inspection service should be initiated by pooling at 
least the available waste-cleanup ships and equipment under a 
single command (they are currently assigned to the auxiliary 
fleet), completing the construction of the bilge water treatment 
stations, and cooperating with the kray environmental protection 
committee. These environmental protection measures will hardly 
result in an immediate return that can be measured in rubles or 
other currency. Another kind of return is more important -- an 
averted ecological disaster that has been planted like a mine 
under our future.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel A. Nizhalovskiy, candidate of </F>
historical sciences and docent, under the rubric "From the 
Directorate of the Chief of Engineering Troops of the Russian 
Federation's Ministry of Defense" : "An Assembly of 
Administrative Personnel of the Engineering Troops"] 
  [Text] In accordance with the plan for training the Russian 
Federation's armed forces a special operational assembly was 
conducted at the end of August 1993 under the supervision of 
Colonel-General V. Kuznetsov. This was the first such assembly 
on this level in the Russian Army. 
  More than two years had gone by since the last assembly, 
that 
one was in the Soviet Armed Forces. During that time a 
considerable portion of the engineering troops transferred to 
the armies of the independent states, former republics of the 
USSR, to industrial enterprises and design offices. 
  Russia's engineering troops have now taken shape, and the 
administrative personnel have been 40-percent renewed. There 
have been large changes also in the nature, the scope and the 
organization of engineer support missions. There are new weapon 
models and ammunition, and the conditions surrounding their 
safekeeping and operation have become more complicated. That is, 
there have been fundamental changes in the conditions for the 
functioning of the engineering troops and in views on their 
combat employment and path of development. 
  The first day of activity was devoted to theoretical issues. 
In his report Col-Gen Kuznetsov summed up the results of the 
first stage of the development of Russia's engineering troops 
and told about prospects for their development and the main 
missions which must be accomplished in the immediate future. He 
also touched upon problems arising as a result of the altered 
geopolitical circumstances, the collapse of the USSR and the 
transition to market conditions. These were further developed in 
reports and speeches by deputy chiefs of engineering troops of 
the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense, the chiefs of 
leading departments at the Military Engineering Academy imeni 
V.V. Kuybyshev and a representative of the General Staff 
Military Academy. 
  The assembly participants were particularly concerned about 
the fact that the scope of engineer support missions is tending 
to grow. The periods allowed for their execution is being 
reduced or remains the same, but the size of these forces is 
dropping considerably in the situation of reform of the Russian 
Army. This is reflected primarily in the fortification equipment 
of lines and positions, the establishment of engineer obstacles 
and the performance of operational and tactical camouflage 
measures. 
  It is obvious in this situation that it would be expedient 
to 
revise the deadlines involved and the extent of the 
fortifications, making protection of the personnel against 
weapons the keystone. In setting up the system of engineer 
obstacles we need to switch decisively from the mining of areas 
to the mining of specific facilities, the laying of most mixed 
minefields in the course of combat operations, on revealed 
sectors of enemy operations. Success in the execution of 
engineer measures will depend to a large extent upon the use of 
the latest facilities and the improvement of camouflage 
measures, and the enlistment not just of engineering subunits 
but also, and primarily, subunits of the troop army and branches 
of the armed forces for the performance of these missions. 
  Considerable problems are arising in the course of 
establishing new groupings of engineer troops. The withdrawal of 
a large number of formations and units of troops and their 
settlement within Russia, with a simultaneous reduction in 
numerical strength and the lack of vacant military posts, 
particularly housing, are making it impossible to set up 
groupings of engineer troops in the classical sense. This 
requires a great deal of effort not just of the command element 
of the engineer troops but also the commanders of the military 
districts. 
  Assembly participants considered such urgent problems as 
moral and psychological support for the operations of the 
engineer troops and indoctrination of the personnel at the 
modern level of their functioning. 
  Recently, given the withdrawal of troops and the large-scale 
removal of ammunition from the groups of forces, we are faced 
with a drastic exacerbation of the crime situation in the 
nation, with the problem of safeguarding the weapons and 
ammunition moving to the fore. The latter was the subject of 
discussion on the second day of the assembly. Classes were held 
at one of the arsenals of the engineer troops. Specific 
recommendations were worked out for safeguarding special 
ammunition in the districts and armies, and ways to solve the 
problems were outlined. 
  The third day was equally repleted and useful. For six hours 
the participants were acquainted with new models of engineering 
equipment and ammunition, prospective directions for the 
development of engineer weapons were discussed, and experience 
in their employment in various areas of the nation and at hot 
spots was exchanged. The assembly participants learned with 
great interest about the extent and the organization of 
engineering missions and the specific features of engineer 
installations on the Tajik-Afghan border. After all, matters of 
fortifying the border sectors, coverning the sectors with the 
greatest mine danger and provisioning the troops with water 
following the tragic July events at the 12th Border Post have 
moved to the forefront. 
  A class on means and methods of operational and tactical 
camouflage was equally interesting and instructive. It was set 
up at the training center of the Military Engineering Academy 
imeni V.V. Kuybyshev. The entire complex of means of camouflage 
and simulation--from the simplest of fire arms to a missile 
complex--was graphically represented there. The assembly 
participants were further convinced of the multilevel nature and 
complexity of camouflage measures. 
  Unquestionably the new models of engineer equipment, the new 
engineering ammunition and the prospective means of camouflage 
are all making it possible to raise the techniques and the 
organization of engineer support missions to a higher 
qualitative level. Due to difficulties with financing, however, 
the production of many new models not inferior to their Western 
counterparts in efficiency and originality of technical 
solutions is becoming a big problem. 
  At the conclusion of the assembly the chief of engineering 
troops of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense summed up 
the results and set missions for all areas of activity of the 
engineer troops, taking into account existing economic, social 
and financial circumstances. The objectives set for the assembly 
were met in their entirety. Its participants were not only 
enriched with new knowledge but also took with them into the 
forces numerous reference books and aids, and recommendations 
for carrying out the missions in the new circumstances.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Sergeyev: "Russian Ministry for Emergencies </F>
Rushes to the Aid of Countrymen"] 
  [Text] This morning another humanitarian convoy set out for 
the Republic of Georgia from the city of Noginsk, near Moscow. 
It was organized by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for 
Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Natural Disasters. 
  This time the assistance is intended for a Russian community 
of dukhobortsy [a religious sect which opposed the 
Orthodox Church] which settled in the south of Georgia more than 
150 years ago. To carry out agricultural work, they will be 
supplied with 200 tons of gasoline and diesel fuel carried on 50 
trucks. In the opinion of the First Deputy Ministry for 
Emergencies Yuriy Vorobyev, this action must raise the morale of 
all of our countrymen who find themselves in difficult economic 
conditions outside the borders of Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Igor Kasatonov, deputy commander in </F>
chief of the Russian Navy, by Andrey Papushin: "`I Hope Common 
Sense Will Prevail'" -- place, date not given; first seven 
paragraphs are introductory comments by Leonid Gvozdev] 
  [Text] A ball of problems, insults, agreements, and 
violations regarding the Black Sea Fleet is growing, threads are 
falling unevenly, loops are getting tighter... Those who are 
not winding or tightening it, but are just following the events 
may notice that any new knot emerges in the ball precisely when 
something goes wrong with politicians elsewhere, in a place 
fairly remote from Crimea or the Black Sea, and when they 
desperately need to distract society's attention. 
  I will not recall ill-conceived, and sometimes even 
provocative, actions, the starting point of which is located in 
Ukraine -- more than enough has already written about that. But 
on our, Russian part there have been plenty of them, too. 
Suffice it to recall at least the explosive decree on Crimea by 
the former Supreme Soviet... 
  Meanwhile, the matter is as simple as it is complicated. 
Maybe the only thing we need is to say aloud for all to hear a 
few obvious axioms, however unpleasant they might sound to a 
Russian ear. Such as, for instance: Crimea is part of the 
territory of friendly Ukraine. Just say so and stop kindling 
dangerous and futile hopes of many (yes, many!) residents of the 
peninsula. After all, a bloc called "Russia" has already won an 
election there! (I wonder how Russian patriots and "patriots" 
would react if a party named after a neighboring state that has 
territorial claims on us were to win elections in a Russian 
oblast?) I do not know what the activists of Crimea's "Russia" 
are seeking and what their program is in the long run, but I can 
guess what these games may end in. War and bloodshed. Nothing 
less. 
  But Ukraine seemed about to be ready to give up the Black 
Sea 
Fleet. Or rather to sell its share. We too would have agreed 
on the lease of land and water territories one way or another. 
It is clear even to a fool that the maintenance of the Black 
Sea Fleet is too costly for it. Just a little more bargaining 
and there you are... But who, please, tell me, would constantly 
try to humiliate and maliciously provoke its partner while 
bargaining is under way? 
  Don't you see, dear readers, that the Black Sea Fleet 
problem 
and that of Baykonur are very much alike? But we did resolve 
the space center dispute! After some bargaining the two sides 
resolved it to mutual satisfaction. How could it be otherwise! 
Now imagine journalists and politicians screaming day in and 
day out into Kazakhstan's ear: "Baykonur is ours! 
Ours!! OURS!!!" Would we gain much by such bargaining? 
  There is something to ponder here. 
  Turning to Adm. Kasatonov, deputy commander in chief of the 
Russian Navy, we, of course, did not know in advance what 
answers he might give. We would have published them in any way, 
but now that the text of the conversation is ready and approved, 
we can welcome with satisfaction and understandable relief its 
calm and businesslike tone, its clear and realistic content. In 
my view, this is precisely the case where a trite expression -- 
a balanced approach -- would be pertinent. 
  [Papushin] Igor Vladimirovich, your name has been 
justifiably identified by our countrymen with Sevastopol and the 
Black Sea Fleet. But Moscow is a landlocked city. This is why 
no one is better equipped than you -- who commanded the Black 
Sea Fleet at what may be the most dramatic juncture of its 
modern history -- to tell Muscovites about the situation in 
which people who have defended Russia's southern borders have 
found themselves. 
  Could you, please, briefly characterize the origins and the 
essence of the problems the Black Sea Fleet sailors have to 
solve at this point. 
  [Kasatonov] The problem of the Black Sea Fleet emerged in 
January 1992, that is, at a time when Ukraine began setting up 
its own armed forces. 
  Ukraine's initial stance on the Black Sea Fleet was stated 
by 
President Kravchuk in a protocol of the working meeting of the 
CIS heads of states on 16 January 1992, which said: "The Navy 
of the former USSR is part of the strategic forces of the 
Commonwealth, except for the forces of the Black Sea Fleet that 
will become part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces." The last 
phrase (on the Black Sea Fleet) was included in the protocol 
personally by the Ukrainian president. As early as April 1992, 
however, an edict was issued whereby Black Sea Fleet forces on 
Ukrainian territory were proclaimed part of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces, and only a part of the ships and units was placed under 
the operational command of the CIS Strategic Forces Command. 
Following measure taken by Russia, the edict was suspended. 
Since that time, for nearly two years already, talks on the 
Black Sea Fleet have been under way at various levels between 
the Russian Federation and Ukraine. 
  Three interstate agreements have been signed -- the Dagomys 
agreement of 23 June 1992; the Yalta agreement of 3 August 1992; 
the Moscow agreement of 17 June 1993; and also the Massandra 
protocol of 3 September 1993. 
  In the Dagomys agreement, the sides expressed their 
readiness to develop their relations as friendly states and to 
start working out without delay a full-scale political treaty. 
They reaffirmed the importance of continuing talks on setting 
up in the Black Sea the Russian and Ukrainian Navies (on the 
basis of the Black Sea Fleet). They also agreed to use on a 
contract basis the existing system of deployment and logistic 
support, and also to refrain from unilateral actions with regard 
to the Fleet until talks are completed. 
  The Yalta agreement established a transition period (up to 
1995 inclusive) to form the Russian and Ukrainian Navies in the 
Black Sea. The two sides agreed to bring the Black Sea Fleet up 
to strength with conscripts in an equal proportion (50-50) and 
to conclude follow-up agreements to specify provision of the 
Yalta accord. 
  In the Moscow agreement, the sides specified that they would 
complete the formation of the Russian and Ukrainian Navies by 
1996; the Fleet would be split equally (50-50), same as the cost 
of its financing before the split is completed. At the same 
time, the Russian Federation and Ukraine stressed once again 
that any unilateral actions with regard to the Black Sea 
Fleet during the transition period are prohibited. 
  Finally, in the Massandra protocol the presidents agreed 
that 
the entire Black Sea Fleet would be turned over to Russian 
jurisdiction along with its entire infrastructure in Crimea and 
that Russia would compensate Ukraine for its share... 
  I have deliberately characterized all the agreements so that 
readers will understand the problems [as published, apparently 
"steps" or "measures"] that have been taken to find a solution. 
However, they have not been realized, but not through the 
Russian side's fault. 
  By now only a few minor provisions of the Yalta agreement 
have effectively been implemented: On the appointment of the 
Black Sea Fleet commander directly subordinated to the two 
presidents, and on bringing the Fleet up to strength with 
Russian and Ukrainian conscripts, each side providing 50 
percent. As for the provision on joint financing and on banning 
unilateral actions, they have constantly been violated by the 
Ukrainian side. 
  Since January 1992 alone the Ukrainian authorities have 
taken 
more than 70 unlawful actions against the Black Sea Fleet. The 
Ukrainian leadership (primarily the Defense Ministry) is taking 
economic, political, legislative, and information measures aimed 
at deciding the Black Sea Fleet's fate in its favor. For 
instance, in order to persuade wavering servicemen to take an 
Ukrainian loyalty oath they have been promised various kinds of 
benefits. With regard to those who remain true to the oath they 
once took, various methods have been invented to frighten them 
and to infringe on their rights. Where the situation allowed, 
individual units and ships of the Black Sea Fleet have been 
placed under the command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The 
seizure and hijacking to Odessa of the SKR-112 ship; the 
detention of a Pacific Fleet floating dry dock for more than two 
years amount to unprecedented actions violating all tenets of 
international law... First the Ukrainian side prevented Russia 
from financing the Black Sea Fleet thus trying to break the 
Black Sea Fleet sailors; then -- having realized that it is 
unable to maintain the Fleet -- it completely stopped financing 
it in September 1993. Moreover, it has imposed on a fleet 
subordinated to the Ukrainian president customs duties and a 
land tax. 
  The Russian Defense and Foreign Ministries' protests against 
these unlawful actions have fallen on deaf ears; not a single 
illegal enactment has been rescinded after the protests were 
lodged. 
  From what I have said it becomes clear that the Black Sea 
Fleet sailors are facing mounting problems, including the status 
of the city of Sevastopol, dual citizenship, the logistic 
support and maintenance of the Fleet, social safety nets, 
housing problems. And also the forcible collection of taxes for 
land use and customs duties for cargoes brought in for the 
Fleet's needs from funds earmarked to pay money allowances to 
Black Sea Fleet servicemen and civilian employees. 
  In addition, there are problems in the Black Sea Fleet that 
are typical of all fleets -- first of all a lack of funds for 
repair and the maintenance of the ships' technical readiness. 
  These are, of course, the key problems. 
  [Papushin] What way of resolving the problems do you see? 
  [Kasatonov] By implementing the Massandra protocol of 3 
September 1993. An agreement should be drawn up "whereby 
the entire Black Sea Fleet with its entire infrastructure 
in Crimea will be operated by Russia and obtain Russian 
symbols." This fundamental decision would make it possible 
to remove the Black Sea Fleet issue from the agenda of talks 
between Russia and Ukraine and to resolve the main problems 
facing the Fleet. The main thing is that this would meet the 
expectations of the personnel. 
  But at present the talks between state delegations have 
stalemated: The Ukrainian side is for the umpteenth time trying 
to shirk the implementation of earlier agreements. 
  [Papushin] What steps are the Russian Navy command taking to 
settle the situation around the Black Sea Fleet? 
  [Kasatonov] Owing to subordinating the Black Sea Fleet 
directly to the presidents of the Russian Federation and 
Ukraine, the possibilities of the Black Sea Fleet command are 
limited. At the same time, we constantly analyze and assess the 
situation in the Fleet. The basis for such an analysis is 
provided by reports from the command of the Fleet and the work 
by officers of the central Navy apparatus in the Fleet. This 
makes it possible to react to changes in the situation in a 
timely manner and file corresponding reports with proposals to 
the leadership and the president of Russia. 
  During the first quarter of this year alone, the Navy has 
lodged protests with Ukraine's Defense Ministry, and submitted 
reports to the government and the president of Russia concerning 
the illegal actions on the part of the Ukrainian side in 
violation of the understandings reached (the seizure -- in 
December 1993 -- of the Naval Engineering Service departments, 
and the Directorates of the work supervisor in Nikolayev, 
Odessa, and Izmail; in February 1994, of a hospital base and a 
naval hospital in Nikolayev; and in March 1994, of the naval 
sick bay in Ochakov). Such protests lodged over last two years 
are without number. 
  The Navy command, together with qualified experts, takes 
part 
in the negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet, works out proposals 
for the inclusion in the drafts of negotiation documents, 
provides necessary information to the state delegation, carries 
out special expert assessment of proposals being considered. 
  The questions of social protection for the Fleet's personnel 
are also in the center of attention. Notwithstanding all the 
difficulties with financing, and despite the hurdles raised by 
Ukraine's Defense Ministry, funds are found to provide 
allowances and other types of supply to the personnel in a 
timely manner. 
  [Papushin] What is the Fleet's material-technical and moral 
state today? 
  [Kasatonov] The Fleet's vague status and the Ukrainian 
side's 
actions aimed at hampering its activity put additional limits on 
supplying the Black Sea Fleet with some types of materiel. The 
customs duties (up to 0.15 percent of the cost) levied by 
Ukraine on imported military equipment, and the introduced rent 
on land limit the Fleet's possibility for buying the necessary 
materiel, for repairing ships and vessels. For example, as 
little as a third of the ships needing repair can be taken care 
of in the current year, and the Fleet command is unfortunately 
powerless to help it in this matter. Unless the status of the 
Black Sea Fleet has been determined, it is impossible to 
appropriate funds for capital construction, the construction of 
housing and of sociocultural facilities. 
  Such a state of affairs causes considerable difficulties in 
carrying out combat training and maintaining the Fleet's forces 
in the prescribed readiness to carry out its assigned mission. 
  Meanwhile the morale of Black Sea Fleet personnel today 
affords continued maintenance of the Fleet's forces in the 
prescribed degree of combat readiness. I would like to 
underline with deep satisfaction that, in this complex 
situation, the overwhelming majority of the personnel remain 
true to the oath of loyalty and, despite the persistent attempts 
by Ukraine's Defense Ministry to force them into taking the oath 
of loyalty to Ukraine, continue to carry out their military duty. 
  Unfortunately, the Fleet's location on the territory of 
another state makes it for the time being impossible to extend 
to its servicemen the rights and benefits provided for in 
Russia. This to a certain extent affects the moral climate in 
the military collectives. But we are taking all possible 
measures to solve the fundamental legal questions applicable to 
the Fleet's personnel. 
  [Papushin] Is the Fleet capable of carrying out missions 
assigned to it? 
  [Kasatonov] At the present time -- despite all the political 
and material difficulties it is experiencing, and given the 
makeup of the forces and weapons for naval combat, technical 
state, the amount and state of training of its personnel, and 
the provision of all types of materiel -- the Black Sea Fleet 
retains the capability to carry out the assigned missions and, 
what is more, is a stabilizing factor in the Black Sea region. 
  The standard missions of the Fleet are to repulse the 
strikes 
of a possible adversary from the sea, to protect merchant 
shipping, to participate together with other services and arms 
in carrying out of joint missions in the maritime sector, among 
a range of other missions. 
  The presence in the Black Sea zone of regional conflicts has 
additionally set the Black Sea Fleet the missions of a 
peacekeeping nature. Suffice it to say that, ever since the 
armed conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia broke out (in August 
1992) the Fleet's forces have been periodically called upon to 
evacuate refugees, escort convoys with humanitarian aid to 
civilian populations provided by Russia and the other CIS 
countries, provide materiel to combined units of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces present in the conflict zone. Over the 
period, the Fleet's ships and vessels have carried nearly 70,000 
people and 45,000 tonnes of cargo. For example, in August 1992 
a great number of vacationers were urgently shipped from the 
territory of Abkhazia, including 58 children evacuated from a 
Young Pioneer camp in Pitsunda at the Ukraine president's 
request. A Black Sea task force (made up of eight ships, two 
vessels, and a reinforced marine battalion) was guarding and 
defending the sea port and the rail center in Poti and protected 
shipping along the coastline of Georgia and Abkhazia in the 
period between 1 and 30 November on the basis of a decision made 
by the governments of Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia. 
  Those are far from all the missions the Black Sea Fleet 
happened to carry out in modern conditions and which the Fleet's 
personnel is carrying out in a proper fashion. 
  [Papushin] Some writers (and occasionally even politicians) 
maintain that a single and powerful Black Sea Fleet is an 
extravagant luxury, especially given that the situation in the 
Black Sea does not threaten Russia's security. Why is so much 
importance being attached to the preservation of a single Black 
Sea Fleet? 
  [Kasatonov] As a military man who, in addition, has for a 
long time dealt with the problem of ensuring the protection of 
Russia's interests in the Black Sea region, I cannot agree with 
such statements. 
  The Black Sea Fleet has always played a major role in 
stabilizing the situation in the southwestern strategic sector, 
including the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Stability in 
this region has been ensured by achieving a strategic balance of 
forces, and the violation of this balance can lead to 
developments in the military-political situation unfavorable to 
Russia. At this stage already one can see increasing naval 
activity by foreign states, primarily Turkey... The 
disintegration of the single Black Sea Fleet, sought by Ukraine 
(and, as a result, the declining combat capability of its forces 
in the central and western parts of the Black Sea), will allow 
the Turkish Navy to become the leader in the Black Sea region. 
This will enable Turkey to resolve its geopolitical tasks of 
gaining and consolidating its influence on the Black Sea basin 
countries, which Russia has been fighting to prevent for several 
centuries.... 
  Furthermore, as the situation shows, the unceasing regional 
conflicts in the eastern part of the Black Sea require a 
sufficient amount of mobile forces capable, with ground 
communications disrupted, of ensuring the operation of the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces units stationed on the territory 
of Transcaucasian CIS member states. These tasks are now being 
accomplished successfully by Black Sea Fleet forces. 
  In peacetime, ways of safeguarding Russia's interests in the 
southwestern sector lie primarily in creating a reliable defense 
system allowing, with any (even the most unfavorable) situation, 
to prevent potential damage for the country. This system should 
envision the creation of stable and favorable operational 
conditions allowing to maintain effective control of the sea and 
the adjacent coast. 
  Clearly, such tasks are within the range of only such a 
single and sufficiently powerful fleet as the Black Sea Fleet. 
  There is also another aspect to this problem: Close 
interrelation of all the Fleet structures to ensure its normal 
functioning. 
  We have always acted on the assumption that the Fleet's 
missions can be achieved only with the entire strength of the 
Black Sea Fleet, in interaction with other fleets and branches 
of the Armed Forces. In other words, only a single fleet is 
capable of ensuring the requisite concentration of efforts and 
most effective accomplishment of missions in areas of threat. 
  On the other hand, Ukraine's unilateral seizure, for 
instance, of a Black Sea Fleet unit on Zmeinyy Peninsula, 
designed to monitor the situation and ensure the security of 
navigation in the western part of the Black Sea, has led to a 
substantial weakening of the Black Sea Fleet capabilities for 
early detection of foreign warships and aircraft. 
  In upholding the preservation of a single Black Sea Fleet, 
we 
relate this closely also to the interests of the people serving 
there: The Fleet's division can have most severe complications 
for their fate. 
  [Papushin] Has the situation around the Black Sea Fleet 
changed following presidential elections in Crimea? 
  [Kasatonov] Yes, it has generally changed. Since the moment 
he took office Yuriy Meshkov and his military adviser have 
stated repeatedly: 
  a) the need to downsize Ukrainian troops on the peninsula 
(in 
the past year alone their strength has grown from 18,000 to 
51,000); 
  b) the sufficiency of the Black Sea Fleet forces for 
protecting the southern sea borders of Ukraine and Russia; 
  c) the promotion of businesslike contacts with the Black Sea 
Fleet Command on major aspects of the military-political 
situation in Crimea. 
  Such an approach, as well as a number of other statements by 
the Crimean president with respect to Kiev officialdom, was not 
slow in producing a reaction: On 1 April 1994 L. Kravchuk 
appointed his special representative to Crimea. 
  In view of a change of leadership in Crimea it has also 
attracted increased attention from the U.S. Embassy in Kiev and 
U.S. Ambassador Miller in particular. During a recent visit to 
Sevastopol he stated that he wants to study the problems of the 
Fleet and Crimea personally.... Regrettably, Russian Ambassador 
Smolyakov has not even once visited Sevastopol in the past year. 
On the other hand, the city's problems have evoked a response 
from the mayors of Moscow, Volgograd, Krasnodar, and Belgorod. 
  With these changes in the situation, Ukraine's Air Force has 
intensified its activity around the Black Sea Fleet. Statements 
by its command have appeared in the media about the Black Sea 
Fleet's "illegal" presence in Crimea, the need to return to the 
Yalta agreements and to renounce the Massandra protocol. Work 
is under way to move the Ukrainian Air Force Headquarters to the 
territory of the former Nakhimov Higher Naval Academy (at 
present the headquarters is located on the territory of a former 
military construction NCO school). This is an attempt by 
Ukraine's Air Force to strengthen its presence in Crimea. 
  [Papushin] How do you assess the efforts by the Moscow City 
Hall and government to render assistance to the Fleet and 
Sevastopol? 
  [Kasatonov] Only positively. We are grateful to the 
Muscovites and Yuriy Mikhaylovich Luzhkov personally for 
reviving a dying tradition: Sponsorship by oblasts, krays, and 
cities of the Navy's battleships and units. As for Sevastopol, 
thanks to the Moscow City Hall and government, a project has 
been launched to build a 100-apartment residential complex for 
the seamen's families. The first floor of a 15-apartment section 
has been put up already, and a foundation has been laid for a 
20-apartment section. Work is proceeding on schedule. The 150 
million rubles transferred to the personnel of the Moskva 
cruiser have been used to buy TV sets, VCR's, and musical 
instruments; psychological relaxation rooms are being set up for 
servicemen where they will be able to relax and spend their 
leisure hours effectively. 
  Out the 30 tonnes of humanitarian supplies, the Fleet's 
servicemen have by unanimous consent donated five tonnes to 
helicopter pilots, five tonnes to the marines, one tonne to a 
kindergarten, and one tonne to a hospital. A share has also 
been ceded to ailing war veterans. 
  Moscow's example of maintaining direct patronage links has 
been followed by cities and districts in Krasnodar and Stavropol 
Krays and several regions in Volga Oblast. Documents are being 
prepared for Moscow Oblast's sponsorship program for the Navy's 
flagship, the USSR Admiral Kuznetsov cruiser.... We hope that 
this benevolent wave of sponsorship will also reach other 
regions of Russia. 
  As for Sevastopol, it will again be waiting for its patrons: 
For the celebration of the 50th anniversary of liberation. On 
7 May groups of entertainers, artists, musicians, and writers 
will arrive there, and we are sure that these meetings will 
benefit all. 
  Incidentally, at present intensive preparations are 
beginning 
to mark the 50th anniversary of the city's liberation: The 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has allocated two billion 
karbovanets for these purposes. According to preliminary 
reports from the organizing committee, approximately 1,300 
veterans of the Great Patriotic War from other Commonwealth 
countries and cities have expressed an interest in taking part 
in the festivities. 
  I very much hope that common sense will prevail. That the 
fate of the Black Sea Fleet will be decided in accordance with 
the Massandra Protocol and that the Fleet will continue in the 
future fittingly to ensure protection of Russia's borders from 
southern maritime directions, serving as a guarantor of 
stability in the entire Black Sea region. 
  [Papushin] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain Oleksandr Dranikov, NARODNA ARMIYA </F>
correspondent, under the rubric "They Serve the People of 
Ukraine": "If Need Be, We Will Accept Both the `Shuttle' and 
`Buran' -- Say the Men from the X Aviation Equipment Command"] 
  [Text] We had heard of the airfield located near the small 
Ukrainian town of Tokmak while still in the Western Troop 
Grouping. Nearly four years ago, there were plans to transfer 
one of the aviation regiments of the Western Troop Grouping to 
Tokmak. The pilots who had flown reconnaisance in Ukraine gave 
high praise to both the airfield and the people serving there. 
And why not? It is located in the beautiful steppes of Tauria. 
The runway is wonderfully suited to any type of airplane. The 
airfield has everything that an aviation unit needs: Parking 
areas for the planes, the necessary communications facilities, 
and modern equipment. In short, the aviators of the Western 
Troop Grouping would have been only too glad to serve there. 
Unfortunately, however, this was not meant to be. What ensued 
was a flaunting of sovereignties, as it was then called, and the 
aviation regiment flew off under the Russian flag to Kursk 
Oblast. 
  Meanwhile, the Tokmak airfield continued its quiet, 
provincial existence. But not for long. A storm was moving in 
from the Black Sea, even though Tokmak is some distance away. At 
any moment, the Sevastopol clouds were threatening to explode in 
thunder and lightning... 
  By now, the reader has probably figured out that the 
aviation 
equipment command [aviatsiyno-tekhnichna komendatura] has no 
connection with the customary duties of military service. There 
is also no military police unit [hauptvakhta] for offending 
airplanes. The job of the aviation equipment command is to do 
what needs to be done to make possible distant flights by 
individual airplanes or groups of airplanes. That was also the 
job of the personnel of the airfield--servicing the aircraft of 
the Black Sea Fleet. They were subordinated, accordingly, to the 
command of the Black Sea Fleet, and they tried to serve in a 
manner that would not bring dishonor to the naval uniform. And 
they succeeded. There were no complaints from the Black Sea 
Fleet command--but only up to a given moment. 
  After Ukraine became an independent state, the personnel of 
the aviation equipment command held a general meeting at which 
they decided to take the Military Oath of Loyalty to the people 
of Ukraine. 
  Incidentally, this was the second unit in the Black Sea 
Fleet, after the battalion of marines, to hoist the 
yellow-and-blue flag... This raising of the flag, however, was 
only a symbolic action, inasmuch as the unit had taken the 
Ukrainian oath three days before the State Flag of Ukraine was 
approved. 
  This action did not get a great deal of publicity--after 
all, 
all sorts of things were then happening in the provinces. But 
the response from Sevastopol was lightning swift. The then 
Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Igor Kasatonov, proclaimed the 
Commander of the unit, Viktor Petrovskyy, all but a criminal and 
ordered him to be dismissed from his job and arrested. 
  Shortly after this, the unit was visited by a Commission, 
headed by Major-General Borys Shevchenko, Chief of Rear Services 
of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force. A campaign was launched to 
persuade the unit to renounce its Ukrainian oath. But the 
servicemen of the Aviation Equipment Command remained steadfast. 
Then came the threats. When this also failed to produce results, 
an order was issued to hand over all the existing equipment to 
the main aviation base of the Black Sea Fleet. This involved no 
more and no less than 179 special motor vehicles. Warrant 
Officer Kostyantyn Romanenko, who was responsible for the 
vehicles, refused to carry out the order. Major Viktor Petrenko 
also regarded this order to be illegal. And so they managed to 
keep the equipment. But the Black Sea specialists would not have 
been rear-service personnel had they left empty-handed. Failing 
to get the equipment, they promptly began to haggle... over the 
production of the subsidiary plot. And they succeeded in leaving 
with 70 hogs, 10 cows, more than 200 rams, and a couple hundred 
chickens. If it weren't so sad, it would be funny, as they say. 
  After taking everything they could take, the Black Sea Fleet 
command progressively began to reduce all deliveries of supplies 
to the airfield. There was chaos at the top, but it was not the 
staff officials who suffered. This ambiguity--although the 
aviation command [aviakomendatura] had taken the Ukrainian oath, 
it was still subordinated to the Black Sea Fleet--produced all 
sorts of oddities. The story of the handing over of the grunting 
and mooing livestock pales in comparison with the incident 
involving the missiles that followed. Yes, you read it right, 
air-to-air missiles. 
  It so happened that the fighter aviation regiment that was 
then stationed in Zaporizhzhya had given the unit commanded by 
Major Petrovskyy 83 missiles for safekeeping. Shortly 
thereafter, the aviation regiment was transferred to Kazakhstan, 
and the responsible officials simply forgot about the missiles. 
The Major spent two years corresponding with various staffs 
before he found the owners of the missiles. For two years, the 
unit diligently looked after the missiles, while military 
officials of various ranks literally kicked around Petrovskyy's 
request from office to office and from republic to republic. 
  ...Today, as we sat in a sheltered command post, Major 
Viktor 
Petrovskyy and his Deputy for Educational and 
Social-psychological Work, Senior Lieutenant Vasyl Romanenko, 
laughed as they told this story. But how much civic courage did 
Petrovskyy need to hold out then, at the dawn of the formation 
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? Viktor Mykolayovych had many 
years of service behind him at a nuclear testing range in Novaya 
Zemlya. But here, on the mainland, as it were, he had neither 
picket, nor yard [i.e. nothing]. How would he and his family 
have managed if he had been thrown overboard from his unit in 
the Black Sea Fleet? Where would he have been able to turn had 
this happened? To his old parents in a village near Kryvyy Rih? 
This does not even bear thinking about... 
  A little over a year and a half ago, the tribulations of the 
aviation personnel in the small Ukrainian town finally came to 
an end. At the request of the commander of the unit, the 
aviation equipment command was made part of the 5th Army of the 
Ukrainian Air Force. And what did the "wings of the Fatherland" 
get (and not only they) by taking in the Black Sea Fleet's 
"foundling"? In addition to a wonderful airfield, a large amount 
of needed supplies that are in critically short supply. Here are 
but two figures. The "ownerless" missiles were not the only 
thing that the unit managed to keep. For example, of the 35 
metric tons of fuel used by the 5th Army for flights in 1993, 6 
metric tons came from the storage tanks at the Tokmak airfield. 
Major Petrovskyy's subordinates also helped the young Ukrainian 
fleet. More than 2,000 full sets of naval issue clothing were 
handed over to the Ukrainian Navy. 
  Even though we do not serve our Fatherland to grow rich, 
still, what did the aviators get in return? And here we have 
some interesting numbers. In the last five years, for its 34 
officers and warrant officers, the unit received 14 apartments, 
nine of which were occupied by their new owners in 1993. For the 
sake of comparison: Between 1954 and 1989, the unit was assigned 
only nine apartments. While not all the officers have yet 
received apartments, all those who wanted a household plot got 
one. 
  It should be noted that the success in solving questions 
involving the social welfare of the servicemen is due to the 
active support of the city authorities. Yevhen Karban, the mayor 
of Tokmak, has done a great deal for the servicemen. They came 
to him with a whole variety of requests, and he always showed 
understanding for their needs and did everything in his power to 
help them. This year, the city is prepared to give the unit four 
to five apartments (this means that the housing problem will be 
removed from the agenda for the next few years). Obviously, on 
condition that the Ministry of Defense contributes its share to 
the construction of this housing. I should note that the prices 
at which the city is offering the military the apartments are 
more than reasonable. 
  Small wonder that the prestige of serving in the military 
under these conditions is not falling in the unit but rising! 
Just before I visited the unit, a Certification Commission met 
on selecting candidates for contract military service. There 
were three to four applicants for each vacant private's or 
sergeant's post. 
  Solving the question of contract servicemen is of great help 
to the airfield. Judge for yourselves: The 34 officers and 
warrant officers and 20 term servicemen are responsible for 179 
motor vehicles, 150 of which are in their safekeeping, and 418 
hectares of land housing more than 30 objects and communications 
facilities [obyekty and komunikatsiyi]. Thus, every member of 
the collective has to do his own job and the next man's, as they 
say. 
  For example, Warrant Officer Kostyantyn Romanenko, whom we 
mentioned earlier, is simultaneously the chief of the weather 
station and responsible for the equipment being looked after by 
the unit. Warrant Officer Petro Nayden holds three jobs 
simultaneously--he is in charge of PPM, the munitions supply 
warehouse, and unit's chemical service. Fortunately, guard duty 
in the unit is performed by militarized security forces 
[voyenizovana okhorona]. The servicemen guard only two of eight 
posts. 
  Still, none of the servicemen complain about their lot. They 
work hard and wait for those in the higher staff to finally 
listen to what they think. The thing is that for the last two 
years, the unit commander has submitted numerous proposals 
regarding improving the unit's organizational and staff 
structure. So far, there has been neither welcome nor farewell, 
as the saying goes. This is the only problem that the collective 
cannot resolve on its own. 
  For example, the problem of heating both living quarters and 
office premises seemed much more complicated, but they solved 
it! It had been decided at the outset that the unit would get 
its heat from a boiler that uses oil fuel. The problems with oil 
fuel are well known. Still, the servicemen did not give up. 
Thank God, there is no shortage in the unit of sensible people 
who are jacks of all trades. They reduced the space they used, 
closed down some of their facilities, and put electric boilers 
heated by water in others. Once again, with the help and support 
of the city authorities and local industrial enterprises... 
  I was about to leave the aviation equipment command on a 
gloomy February morning. Major Petrovskyy was handing out 
assignments for the day. His somewhat hoarse voice could be 
heard quite well near the headquarters. As usual, there were 
more jobs than people. Nonetheless, the staff orderly 
[dnyuvalnyy shtabu], Private Vitaliy Malyshev, who could also 
hear everything the major was saying, said with a smile on his 
face: 
  "There are only a few of us, but we wear sailors' T-shirts 
[i.e., we can do anything]. If need be, we'll accept both the 
Shuttle and Buran." 
  I am convinced that his joke contains a lion's share of 
truth.

<F P=106> [Interview with Genrikh Ongirskiy, deputy general designer </F>
at the "Antonov" Aviation Scientific-Technical Complex, by Yuriy 
Kozlov under "Aircraft" rubric: "`Water Is Up to Our Chin but We 
Are Still Breathing'"] 
  [Text] The "Antonov" Aviation Scientific-Technical 
Complex [ANTK] was established in 1946 by the outstanding 
aircraft designer Oleg Antonov. Since that time more than 100 
types and modifications of aircraft of different classes and 
purposes have been built. Apparently there was no one in the 
USSR and there is now no one in the CIS who has not flown in AN 
aircraft at least once in his life. Transport aircraft such as 
the "Ruslan" or "Mriya," passenger aircraft, specialized 
aircraft for agriculture, aerial photography, and forest 
firefighting, polar aircraft, and other AN's are being exported 
to 42 countries of the world. 
  The disintegration of the Union may have hit the aerospace 
industry of the once united country hardest of all. The 
"Antonov" ANTK was afflicted with the same problems as other 
enterprises of the branch that suddenly found themselves on 
different sides of borders and customhouses. Difficulties with 
component parts, nonpayments, low wages, cutbacks, the loss of 
specialists, and spasmodic searches for new partners -- all this 
is also happening at "Antonov." Nevertheless, the aviation 
scientific-technical complex is continuing to develop new 
aircraft and to modify models that were built earlier. The 
following aircraft are in the stage of research, project 
planning, or production: AN-218, AN-180, AN-140, AN-138, AN-70T, 
AN-74T-200, AN-74TK-200, AN-72P (patrol aircraft), AN-32 (polar 
aircraft), and other heavy, superheavy, and multipurpose models. 
  Is it possible for the aerospace complex divided between the 
countries of the CIS to work for the good of the new states or 
are Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the other 
republics of the former USSR destined to become "aviation 
boondocks"? "This must not be allowed, otherwise our competitors 
will immediately replace us in the world and domestic markets," 
thinks Genrikh Ongirskiy, deputy general designer at the 
"Antonov" ANTK. 
  [Kozlov] Genrikh Genrikhovich, you must agree that only a 
superpower can afford to have and develop an aerospace industry. 
At one time the USSR was such a superpower. Now there is no 
USSR. What is the state of its aerospace industry? 
  [Ongirskiy] I think that despite all the political and 
economic difficulties Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan -- the 
largest aviation plant in the former Union is located there -- 
are successfully preserving the scientific-technical potential 
of the recently united complex. Although, of course, young 
specialists are leaving us. 
  [Kozlov] Are you trying to say that the complex remains 
alive 
because of the veterans who have nowhere to go? 
  [Ongirskiy] Everywhere in the world it is above all the 
people who have worked for many years in the aviation and 
aerospace industry who are most appreciated there. Their 
knowledge and experience are considered to be national property. 
When such a specialist in the United States, for example, leaves 
a firm, he is obliged to leave his address and telephone number 
so that at any moment they can find him and hire him or invite 
him for consultation. Here, let us say in the CIS, it is 
dedicated people who work in aviation. There are practically no 
random people. I, for example, joined an air club at the age of 
12 and took the traditional route: I built models, was the 
champion of the Union in the sport of model airplane building, 
did parachute jumping, and flew on a glider. I have nowhere to 
go from aviation and will remain there until the end. And there 
are many people like me. For this reason, a core work force has 
remained at practically all aviation firms. 
  [Kozlov] The organizational will has disappeared, as has the 
state that spared no budgetary funds for the development of 
aviation firms. 
  [Ongirskiy] I cannot agree that this will no longer exists. 
We just received an invitation to a meeting in Moscow, where the 
problems in the aviation industry will be discussed. And such 
meetings are held regularly. The Russian aircraft TU-334 has 
been included in the program for Ukraine. Nor is Russia refusing 
our aircraft. We have very close ties with Omsk, Novosibirsk, 
Arsenyev, and Samara. The branch will not perish. The political 
storms will die down. And world practice indicates that aviation 
firms combine their efforts. Today, hardly anyone can accomplish 
anything alone at an economic advantage for himself -- project 
planning, construction, and testing of new aircraft. The world 
has the American, European, and former Soviet aerospace 
complexes. To destroy our complex would mean not only to lag 
behind for decades but also to create insoluble economic 
difficulties for Russia and for Ukraine. 
  [Kozlov] How would you characterize Ukraine's aviation 
industry? 
  [Ongirskiy] Today it is 300,000 people and 30 enterprises of 
different kinds. I am not talking about space but only about 
aviation. The world's largest plant for the series production of 
aircraft engines is located in Zaporozhye. It produces 5,000 
aircraft engines a year! Naturally, some of the engines are sent 
to Russia. High-quality materials come from Russia. How can one 
destroy this? 
  [Kozlov] There is probably no need to ask about the economic 
state of the "Antonov" firm. I understand that it is bad. So how 
bad is it? Can you see light at the end of the tunnel? 
  [Ongirskiy] Most of the workers here are graduates of the 
Kharkov Aviation Institute. Those from my class are also working 
for Tupolev, Mikoyan, and Ilyushin. The economic situation is 
about the same in all aviation firms. As Reagan said, the water 
is up to our chin but we are still breathing. 
  [Kozlov] Probably some are not pleased about this. Yes, 
there 
are specialists who are dedicated to aviation but there are also 
simply qualified workers and engineers who are doing their work 
well. It is easy to lose them but to hire and train others.... 
  [Ongirskiy] I know from my own friends what it is to shut 
down a plant for two or three months and then to start it up 
again. People pilfer everything, they break window shutters and 
cut wires, and they carry off telephones and disassemble machine 
tools. Later on it is very difficult to restore everything. And 
the equipment is designed in such a way that the more it works 
they better it works. It must not be stopped. Everything must 
keep turning, be lubricated, and wear. The human system is very 
complex and specific. People lose their skills quickly. I worked 
as a lathe hand before being trained at the institute. You come 
back from vacation and you have to regain your skills. 
Engineering and production have a concept called school. It is 
the continual transfer of experience and knowledge. The most 
important task for us today is to preserve the school. Because 
of the financial difficulties, we have to separate ourselves 
from our pensioners, people with good health, clear minds, and a 
strong spirit. They ought to be teaching the young people. By 
the way, the so-called tutorship came to us from the West. They 
leave pensioners in the firms and pay them money to come see 
what is going on, give advice, explain things, and help. Today 
young specialists do not have the opportunity to go the way that 
the patriarchs of aviation went. They know how to use computers 
and they know a lot about their speciality but they lack 
experience. And experience is the most valuable thing in 
aviation. That is what they tell us at Boeing and Lockheed. If 
we lose the school, then entire generations of specialists will 
"fall out" of aviation. 
  [Kozlov] Today the prestige of the former Soviet aviation 
has 
been substantially undermined. Accidents happen and aircraft 
crash and people have begun to discriminate against our 
technology. What is the explanation for this? Is it our general 
collapse or have we already begun to fall hopelessly behind in 
aviation? 
  [Ongirskiy] I would not agree with this. I regularly read 
information about my specialty. Here is an example: 700 aircraft 
of the Boeing Company have to be returned for reworking because 
some defects have been discovered in the tightening of the bolts 
fastening the engines. It turns out that they were tightened too 
much on some aircraft and not enough on others. Or remember the 
recent accident in the skies over Holland. No, our aircraft and 
especially military aircraft are by no means the worst in the 
world. It is no accident that there is so much interest in us at 
all kinds of exhibitions, air parades, and air shows. As for the 
accidents, they happen not just in the sky. Nuclear reactors 
blow up, ships and trains collide, and oil pipelines burn. This 
has to do with the general decline of discipline and the 
spiritual malaise in the country. Technology requires constant 
attention and servicing. For the time being, we are able to 
maintain the level of safety and airworthiness at the necessary 
level in aviation. 
  [Kozlov] Still, aircraft are crashing. 
  [Ongirskiy] Today some strange commercial structures are 
being established that are buying some depreciated aircraft and 
hiring pilots who have been dismissed from aviation and have no 
right to fly. Dispatchers, technicians, engineers, and ground 
flight support personnel are all living people who have to earn 
a wage. Their labor is very stressful. If a person at work is 
thinking about how to feed his family rather than about his 
work, then naturally there will be breakdowns. 
  [Kozlov] Many think that the economic policy of the 
Ukrainian 
Government is changing in the direction of more realism, if we 
can put it this way. Is there a mutual understanding between 
your firm and the government? 
  [Ongirskiy] There is. I personally, for example, am worried 
about the upcoming elections for the Supreme Soviet. If those 
who come to power are people who think that Ukraine should be an 
agrarian country and that it has no need for aircraft and space, 
then this will be a disaster. 
  [Kozlov] What, in your view, must be done so that the 
economic reforms in Ukraine will take place with fewer losses? 
  [Ongirskiy] It is hard to say. Sometimes we put it this way: 
"It will be good just if they do not interfere with us." I do 
not like people who have to destroy things: industry, economic 
ties, and relationships between nations. People must create and 
not destroy.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Major Volodymyr Melnyk, Ukraine's </F>
deputy prosecutor general, by Volodymyr Cherkas; place and date 
not given: "Crimes Are Crimes Also in the Army" -- first 
paragraph is HOLOS UKRAYINY introduction] 
  [Text] A session at Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office 
was discussing what seemed an individual case: Why legal 
proceedings against serviceman V. Bobrov had been discontinued. 
In issue No. 45 of 11 March 1994 our newspaper had written an 
article on this case, entitled "Scene of Crime -- Barracks." 
That is why our reporter was invited to attend the session. 
General Major Volodymyr Melnyk, Ukraine's deputy prosecutor 
general, kept asking his subordinates: "Who discontinued the 
hearing of this case? On what grounds?" In response to this, 
the participants portrayed the criminal situation in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces and the tough situation of military 
prosecutorial bodies in such a way that it was hard to believe 
this was true. This prompted a newspaper reporter to conduct an 
interview with the deputy prosecutor general. 
  [Cherkas] Are numerous violations of the law really 
flourishing in the Ukrainian Army? 
  [Melnyk] Everything that you heard at the session is true. 
Violations of accepted norms in interpersonal relations, ultra 
vires acts, dodging of military service, embezzlements, thefts 
of military equipment and property have recently become 
commonplace. For instance in 1993, the number of violations of 
statute provisions that regulate relations between servicemen 
increased by 19 times in general. In particular, in Defense 
Ministry troops the growth rate was 34 percent. Soldiers are 
often "educated" by means of battery; the hazing of conscripts 
reigns in many military units; order is built on the "punch the 
mug" principle. The number of cases of battery increased by 
more than 70 percent. Do you understand what this means? This 
is mass bashing! 
  Here is an example. At the beginning of March, six sergeants 
from the Chernihiv garrison were brought before the court. They 
had been drunk and had beaten up their 66 subordinates so 
severely that one of the soldiers died. This had been done 
right in front of the company duty officer who had done nothing 
to calm down the drunkards. On 16 March, a "senior" soldier and 
a conscript quarrelled about lack of bread. The "senior" hit 
the newcomer on the chest four times; the latter fell down and 
never got up. He died for a piece of bread! 
  Similar facts of violating the regulations of statutory 
interpersonal relations have lately occurred in Sevastopol, 
Ivano- Frankivsk, and some other military garrisons. Speaking 
in general, we should state with alarm that in January-February 
the rate of this crime has increased by 14 percent in all of 
Ukraine's military formations, and by 37 percent in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces. 
  There is another alarming trend: The suicide rate in the 
Army 
is increasing. In 1993, 123 servicemen killed themselves. Over 
the first two months of 1994, there were 24 such cases. The 
number of cases of draft-dodging has also grown -- desertion, 
going AWOL, and so on. Last year, more than 3,000 such crimes 
were committed. This year, there have been 400 of them. Almost 
2,000 violators are still on the run. While hiding, they 
exacerbate criminal situations and often commit heinous crimes. 
Last year, 414 such cases were disclosed. 
  Unfortunately, thefts of arms and military property have 
become more commonplace in the Army. Not long ago, 15 
Kalashnikov assault rifles and 15 Makarov pistols were stolen 
from one of the units in the Kharkiv garrison. Six assault 
rifles and a machine gun with ammunition have been stolen from a 
coast guard unit in Yevpatoriya. 
  It is startling that the storage of weapons and property is 
not organized in an appropriate manner. Last year, losses 
caused by mismanagement, embezzlements, and thefts cost the 
state a fortune -- 70 billion karbovantsi. This sum includes 
the 65 billion caused by the disappearance of fuel and 
lubricants. Gasoline, kerosene, lubricants, and diesel fuel are 
pumped into Army reservoirs, and only God knows where they 
vanish. 
  We have lately observed the alarming phenomenon of Mafia 
elements penetrating into the Army circles. Some time ago, 
profiteers in uniforms were booked in one of the units in the 
Odessa military district. Those were military financiers who 
had made agreements with local dealers and used Army assets -- 
hundreds of millions karbovantsi -- for trading. Here is 
another example: In July 1993, the Defense Ministry Directorate 
for Material Supplies signed an agreement with a small 
commercial enterprise for the shipping of undershirts and 
transferred 5.6 billion karbovantsi to the dealers. Soldiers 
never saw the undershirts, while the smart dealers paid back the 
money five months later, this time significantly devaluated. 
  [Cherkas] Regarding this, let me ask you a hackneyed 
question: What is the prosecutor doing? At the session that 
you have just conducted, military prosecutors maintained that 
they would not be able to continue work under the current 
circumstances. 
  [Melnyk] Their stories are absolutely true. The point is 
that the former chiefs of Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office 
virtually destroyed the existing system of military prosecution, 
claiming that the Army did not need it. Although genuine legal 
experts opposed this, their voices were ignored. For example, 
General Major of Legal Service V. Melnychuk, military prosecutor 
of the Western region, appealed to various state institutions 
but nobody paid any attention. As a result of this, the most 
experienced military lawyers abandoned the Army for other legal 
bodies. We found ourselves, so to say, back where we started. 
Although the military prosecutor's service has been legalized 
again, it is to be comprised of 484 specialists, while as of 
today, we have only 300. Eighty eight of these people are 
investigators, charged with the following primary tasks: 
Supervision over the observance of Ukrainian laws by bodies of 
command, military formations, combined units, units, and 
subunits, establishments, and military educational institutions, 
the officials of the Armed Forces, the Border Troops, the 
National Guard, the Department of State Protection, the Security 
Service, and other military formations in Ukraine. Can you 
imagine the scope of their responsibilities? The monthly 
workload of a military investigator is five times the volume of 
the workload of a territorial [civil] investigator. And you are 
asking what military prosecutors are doing. From morning until 
evening, and often at night these people hardly have time to 
breathe. Getting to the venue to carry out an investigation is 
another problem, because there is either no car or no gasoline. 
Military lawyers continuously apply for termination of Army 
service. We have no one to replace these people -- there is not 
a single educational institution in Ukraine training specialists 
for military prosecution. 
  Still, even under these conditions people work and 
persistently uphold legality and order in the young Army of 
sovereign Ukraine. In 1993, 36 percent more criminal cases were 
investigated and sent to courts than in 1992. Purposeful 
preventive activities are being carried out in the Army. Taking 
advantage of the occasion, I want to address servicemen's 
parents by means of the Supreme Council newspaper [HOLOS 
UKRAYINY]: The military prosecutor's service will do everything 
in its power to ensure their sons' legal protection. At the 
same time, I appeal to all the employees of military prosecutor 
offices to step up legal supervision in every way regardless of 
the current tough situation, to firmly keep watch over the 
protection of our state laws. 
  [Cherkas] You should agree that our conversation with 
Ukraine's deputy general prosecutor was not very optimistic. 
The cited facts from servicemen's lives portray a miserable 
picture. I am reading the HOLOS UKRAYINY article "Scene of 
Crime -- Barracks" dealing with the same issues. Perhaps, the 
writer of the article did not look into the current situation of 
the military prosecution attentively enough and his criticism of 
the "bureaucrats in prosecutor chairs" is not quite balanced. 
As it appears from the cited facts, military lawyers do not 
twiddle their thumbs. The criminal situation in the troops is 
indeed horrendous. In my opinion, prosecutorial supervision 
alone is not enough. Apparently the education and 
sociopsychological services of the Defense Ministry and other 
military formations fall short of their task. We probably need 
distinctly coordinated activities of the chiefs of all the 
military services to curb the reign of the violators of the law; 
and to persistently ensure the triumph of the military statutes 
and the military oath. The president of Ukraine, who is 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces should also put in his 
weighty word in this regard. Crimes are crimes also in the Army.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Paklin report specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: </F>
"Bypassing Rivals. Indo-Russian Contracts To Total $100 
Million"] 
  [Text] Delhi -- The shortfall in deliveries of spares from 
Russia for weapons which India bought from the former Soviet 
Union has become the talk of the country. This issue has been 
raised literally at every level up to and including the 
Russo-Indian summit. Our former government found itself 
strangely unable to resolve an issue that was not so difficult. 
But things have now gotten moving -- a package of long-awaited 
contracts on shipments of spares has been signed in Delhi. It 
is mainly a question of meeting the needs of the Indian Air 
Force, not least its naval aviation. 
  "Yet another package of similar contracts will soon be 
signed," Stanislav Filin, deputy general director of the 
"Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, who headed the Russian 
delegation at the first round of the Delhi talks, said. "These 
will stipulate shipments of spares for the ground forces. The 
total value of the contracts will be approximately $100 million. 
The spares issue will thereby mainly be removed from the 
agenda...." 
  But the main result of the Delhi talks, in S. Filin's 
opinion, is that Russia and India have agreed on a program for 
further cooperation in the military sphere that takes account of 
the sides' long-term interests. There has been a great deal of 
speculation in India about the modernization of our MiG-21 
fighters. There are several hundred of these aircraft in 
service with the Indian Air Force. Indian pilots rate their 
performance highly. But over the past few years the MiG-21 has 
become obsolete. Russia has stopped producing them. Hence the 
problem with spares shipments. India came up with the idea of 
not writing off these aircraft but modernizing them. A few 
years ago the Indians appealed to us to draw up a modernization 
program. The Mikoyan design bureau carried out the order. 
Corresponding proposals were put to India. But Delhi's reply 
was delayed. Exploiting this uncertainty, some former Warsaw 
Pact states put their own proposals to India for the 
modernization of the Russian fighters. Recently Israel has been 
particularly importunate in offering its services. Israeli 
delegations have descended on Delhi one after another. Their 
arguments have boiled down to saying that many former Soviet 
aircraft engineers have now emigrated to Israel to work, and 
they will have no difficulty in modernizing the MiG-21. 
  But ultimately India preferred its traditional partner -- 
Russia. Any other decision would have looked strange: It was 
Russia that gave birth to the large MiG family, and even the 
collapse of the Soviet Union has not adversely affected their 
production -- after all, the leading enterprises producing the 
MiG's and components for them are located within the Russian 
Federation. 
  The modernization of the MiG-21 will be substantially 
advantageous for India -- its combat might will be increased at 
least 2.5 times for a relatively small outlay. Winning this 
major order will also be a "shot in the arm" for our aircraft 
plants, which are going through hard times. 
  Accord was also reached at the Delhi talks on the 
acquisition 
by India of a new batch of modern MiG-29's. A figure of 30 
aircraft is being mentioned. Justifying their purchase, the 
Indian side is drawing attention to the increased combat might 
of the Pakistani Air Force. India is particularly concerned 
about the possibility of several dozen U.S. F-16 aircraft being 
supplied to Pakistan, with which it has a strained relationship. 
  But not all of the package of proposals which the Russian 
delegation brought to the Indian capital was agreed. India's 
acquisition of certain types of Russian military hardware was 
postponed. These include the unique "Tunguska" air defense 
system. On the other hand, another avenue in Russo-Indian 
cooperation is opening up -- the leasing of our weapons systems 
to the Indian Army. We agreed that the Indian side could try 
our weapons in its country before making its final choice. 
Admittedly, India will have to pay for the pleasure of seeing 
our latest weapons in action. Military specialists are 
particularly interested in large-caliber Russian guns. The 
Indian Army would like to take a three- to five-year lease on 
some 152-mm self-propelled howitzers. They plan to use them as 
the basis for manufacturing their own 155-mm artillery pieces 
under Russian license in line with the standard used in the 
Indian Army. The gun could be given a "self-propelled" capacity 
by a mount developed on the basis of the T-72 M1 tank. 
  Our new helicopters will substantially strengthen India's 
defense potential. They are designed for antitank warfare. We 
will also be supplying air-defense systems to the Indian Navy. 
  It seems as though the hiatus in Russo-Indian military 
cooperation has been overcome. But it should be remembered that 
a fierce competitive battle is under way for the large Indian 
arms market -- the Indian Army is the fourth largest in the 
world. Britain is persistently offering India its military 
helicopters. The British premier is acting as "fixer." France, 
which has already supplied Mirages, is after more aircraft 
orders. Italy and the United States have not lost hope of 
selling their military aircraft equipment to India. Western 
arms suppliers are offering the Indian Army tanks, artillery 
systems, and other weapons, while offering the Navy their old 
ships as well as new vessels. A winding-down of Russian 
military shipments to India -- something which had begun to 
occur -- would merely have played into our competitors' hands. 
Issues like this are not resolved unilaterally. Russia cannot 
afford to suffer economic, moral, and political damage for the 
sake of abstract principles.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "Pavel Grachev's `Pavlovian' </F>
Reform: Russian Army Won't Be Driving Mercedes Any Time Soon"] 
  [Text] Seventy percent of all officers and warrant 
officers think their units are incapable of performing their 
missions. Up to 40,000 young officers leave the army each year. 
Understaffing of officers (especially young officers) has 
reached a critical point: .2 percent is the margin separating 
the army from a loss of combat readiness. Manning levels for 
enlisted men and sergeants are at just 54 percent. Army losses 
outside of combat zones stood at nearly 2,500 men in 1993, which 
is nearly 500 lives more than in 1992. 
  The Defense Ministry could lose control of the Russian Army 
in the near future. If this happens, General Grachev will be 
issuing orders only within the bounds of the "Arbat Military 
District"--the complex of General Staff buildings on the Arbat. 
  The situation is beyond belief. Boris Yeltsin, continuing 
the 
tradition of talking about the most important issues far away 
from official podiums, unveiled upcoming plans for army reform 
at a meeting with Suvorov School cadets. "The task of 
invigorating military reform has been posed. It is now possible 
to act more decisively and more consistently," said the 
president. The Russian Army will use a new principle to defend 
us--a mobile defense reminiscent of the American "flexible 
response strategy." Instead of unbroken defense along our 
borders, for which there is no longer enough manpower or money, 
we will have compact mobile groups trained to fight local wars. 
They will be the first line in the event of a "big" war. 
  However, Russia is embarking on a very complex reform with a 
Defense Ministry that has already demonstrated its utter 
inability to carry out reforms. In the two years since the 
creation of the Russian Defense Ministry, faith in democratic 
reforms in the army has been totally undermined. And the 
ministry leadership has managed to turn against itself not only 
officers, but also its own people. Hazing has become so bad in 
units, on ships, and even at schools that desertion has reached 
massive proportions. Youths avoid military commissariats like 
the plague. This was discussed at a recent conference entitled 
"Army and Society" in Moscow. After its harsh army conscription 
of students at vocational-technical schools, technicums, and 
commercial higher schools in the fall of 1993, the Defense 
Ministry, according to some reports, is already thinking about 
abolishing student conscription because the educational 
institutions failed to produce significant numbers of recruits. 
  Ideological control over the Armed Forces has now been lost. 
On February 23, as they observed the anniversary of the Red 
Army's creation, probably very few officers recalled that on May 
7, by order of the first Russian president, the Russian Army was 
formed. After abolishing political agencies by Order No. 15 of 
January 12, 1994, the military leadership set no new ideological 
priorities, without which, unfortunately, our army cannot yet 
function. The Defense Ministry didn't even try to revive the 
traditions of the Russian officer corps. The resulting vacuum 
has willingly been filled by "patriots"--the newspaper ZAVTRA, 
with the disclosures of an anonymous general on the events of 
October, was read in some units until it had holes in it. Two 
years too late, Pavel Grachev remembered the Orthodox Church, on 
which the Russian Army was based before the revolution. It will 
probably be another two years before concrete decisions are 
formulated and chaplains appear in the units. 
  The armed forces leadership has also failed to protect the 
army from corruption. 
  The following is from a letter from armed forces and war 
veterans (!) to President Yeltsin: 
  At a time when the state has no way to promptly pay its 
soldiers, more than 20 billion rubles in public funds 
appropriated to the military insurance company (Reserve Colonel 
S. A. Tsikolyuk, president) to be used to provide servicemen 
with life and disability insurance, by order of Grachev and 
Vorobyev, were channeled to commercial structures through the 
Menatep Bank at an interest rate of 240 percent. No one knows 
who is distributing that interest and for what army needs. 
  Of the proceeds from sale of property belonging to the 
Western Group of Forces, less than 15 percent has been allocated 
to finance construction, purchase housing, and solve other 
social problems facing servicemen. On the other hand, millions 
of marks were used to buy an enormous quantity of calcium 
carbide, which is apparently no longer available in Russia, and 
various materials. Money was also found to buy a Mercedes Benz 
that our forces urgently need. 
  After the breakup of the USSR, we ended up with 
third-echelon 
forces. And the most combat-ready units were left behind in the 
ex-Soviet republics. Great hopes were pinned on the divisions 
being withdrawn from Germany, but they became drawn into 
commerce and are returning to Russia utterly incapable of 
combat. Things have reached the point where Polish racketeers 
working the highways have established special duties for Russian 
military transit drivers taking cars to Russia: A Russian 
warrant officer pays 200 marks, an officer 400. 
  It is said that when Soviet troop commanders moved from 
Hungary to Germany, the generals' plane was preceded by heavily 
loaded cargo planes carrying their personal property. "They took 
only the most essential items with them," the pilots joked. Does 
a person need a lot? As it turns out, yes. The cargo planes of 
the Western Group of Forces were so heavily loaded that the 
first deputy commander of the 16th Air Army was arrested and 
jailed. Colonel-General Burlakov, the commander in chief of the 
Western Group of Forces himself, was involved in one case. 
Inspections were of little help. What commission can withstand 
the temptation of German marks, let alone German women! It is 
said that one general who headed a rear-services commission that 
was inspecting the Western Group came back with syphilis--a 
young woman's "gift" for him. 
  There is nothing surprising about the fact that the Western 
Group of Forces has become drawn into commercial 
activities--only command and staff exercises have been held 
there for some time, and the soldiers march on paper only. What 
is surprising is this: Just one or two cases of corruption have 
been made public. Yet such cases are legion. Is it any accident 
that Western Group of Forces Military Procurator Yuriy Yerin was 
recently promoted to general? 
  Reformers have been disliked throughout history. But Pavel 
Grachev's unpopularity is of a quite different nature. The 
minister has recently been accused of selecting personnel on the 
basis of personal loyalty, something that has repeatedly spelled 
the ruin of bureaucrats of various ranks. Moreover, military 
personnel are extremely vulnerable to protectionism: Officers 
are limited in their ability to earn money, and a military 
career is the only thing the state can use to entice them to 
serve. 
  Grachev's unpopularity with the troops has reached the point 
where instead of the honorable title "grandfather," which is 
bestowed on especially respected commanders, General of the Army 
Grachev is called by his first name, together with the word 
"Mercedes," for the car he travels in. A Russian defense 
minister can't ride in some Soviet Volga or Zhiguli! 
  The whole army is discussing Pavel Grachev's recent dispatch 
of his son to the Western Group of Forces, contrary to his own 
order stating that only servicemen with previous service in 
"hotspots" may be sent to lucrative Germany. Senior Lieutenant 
Grachev flew to the Western Group of Forces just a few months 
before the withdrawal of our last forces from Europe. When he 
returns, an apartment in one of the comfortable compounds the 
Germans built for the Russian troops being withdrawn might await 
him. 
  Such mistakes by the defense minister discredit the very 
idea 
of reform. The situation in the army is reminiscent of 
1990-1991, when the unpopular premiers Pavlov and Ryzhkov 
attempted to reform the economy. 
  The Russian Army is no longer combat-ready today. There is 
just ONE Russian missile-armed submarine on alert duty in the 
ocean. (The Americans have 10 or 11 submarines.) Meanwhile, 
according to participants in the "Army and Society" conference, 
all reform has been reduced to the "signing of standard 
contracts, new uniforms, and higher pay." 
  A frightening process has begun in the army. District 
commanders no longer rely on their ministry and turn to local 
authorities directly for help. In this way, the army is becoming 
tied to regions, something that, in the event of a crisis, could 
break it up into component parts. 
  The Defense Ministry is making desperate attempts to enhance 
its prestige. General Kondratyev, the deputy minister, suddenly 
becomes a diplomat and goes to Nagornyy Karabakh to extinguish 
the conflict. Within a few days his much-publicized mission 
collapses, and now Kondratyev is giving interviews in the 
Dniestr region. Pavel Grachev is also making his diplomatic 
debut, but he prefers foreign countries. 
  In recent days the government has launched an outright war 
on 
defense appropriations. The Defense Ministry is asking for 
almost 60 percent of the entire state budget (almost 80 trillion 
rubles), saying the army could collapse. The ministry is indeed 
in a trap--the army has to be cut, since there is not enough 
money, but cuts are impossible because no money is available for 
the legally mandated payments and compensation either. 
  The situation is further compounded by the fact that in this 
transitional period, the old military administrative division of 
Russia into military district has been left intact. This 
essentially requires that the defense budget be doubled. But the 
taxpayers are poor, and so reform will most likely be of a 
shock-therapy character. The Russian Army, it seems, will have 
to cross the Alps yet again. But this time without Suvorov.

"Permission Not Necessary for Russian Peacekeeping Role"] 
  [Text] A rather unpleasant trend in international affairs 
has been gaining momentum. Someone wishes to render the 
peacekeeping operations Russia is carrying out in nearby 
countries problematic relative to Moscow's relations with our 
more geographically distant partners. Ever more frequent are 
statements made by public figures and the news media to the 
effect that Russia's peacekeeping activities constitute some 
kind of "dual nature." The matter in essence amounts to 
allegations that we are using the peacekeeping operations as a 
cover for "neoimperial ambitions", in that Russia is demanding 
the right to interfere in her neighbors' internal affairs. This 
kind of allegation is expressed succinctly in an amendment 
passed several days ago by the U.S. Senate without benefit of 
vote. Included in the part of the draft legislation, which deals 
with defense and foreign policy expenditures, is the following 
provision: "The United States will oppose, employing suitable 
measures, any efforts made by the Russian Federation to employ 
intimidation by the application of military force or economic 
pressure to create a sphere of influence in the republics of the 
former Soviet Union..." 
  What is amazing here is that the document's authors are 
doing 
nothing more than shadowboxing. No one has yet been able to 
furnish any kind of convincing proof of Russia's interfering in 
the internal affairs of her neighboring states. Nonetheless, 
this kind of allegation is not without harm, since it creates 
the dangerous impression that Moscow "must be contained." 
  The above is why Russia's defense and foreign affairs 
ministries considered it necessary to issue a joint statement 
explaining Moscow's approach to the conduct of peacekeeping 
operations. Stressed in the statement is the following: "The 
actions taken by Russia are intended to merely effect a 
cessation of armed conflicts in a number of new and independent 
states, stabilize the situation there, and create conditions 
conducive to a lasting and stable settlement." 
  Indeed, Russia, which more than other countries is 
interested 
in the cessation of all military activities occurring on her 
borders, is shouldering a heavy burden in carrying out her 
peacekeeping operations. This is not to mention the approximate 
amount of 26 billion rubles spent for these purposes in only the 
last 10 months. Russia is risking the lives of her young men. 
  In this connection, and this is something of special 
importance in this situation, Russia's peacekeeping operations 
are not actions arbitrarily taken. They are being carried out in 
direct response to requests made by, and with the consent of, 
the respective states and sides engaged in conflict. The point 
here is that those who perceive the Russian peacekeeping as a 
"threat" are raising the question of mounting these operations 
exclusively on the basis of securing permission from the U.N. or 
the CSCE. And in this they are mixing two issues. 
  Yes, Russia is in favor of the widest possible participation 
by the U.N. and the CSCE in the settling of conflicts occurring 
in CIS member countries. However, there is no need to secure any 
"permission" from these or any other organizations or obtain any 
other legitimation of peacekeeping operations. It would be 
another matter to effect cooperation with international 
organizations such that the latters' active and substantial 
support would constitute meaningful assistance in the 
realization of more effective and rapid settlement of conflicts. 
  In this regard, it is unfortunately necessary to state that 
international institutions, in addition to the individual states 
that are so apprehensive of Russian peacekeeping, are not in any 
way anxious to demonstrate initiative in conflict settlement. 
Thus, our diplomats were unable to obtain a mandate for Russian 
troops from the U.N. or the CSCE for the conduct of peacekeeping 
operations. In addition, other states are definitely not 
enthusiastic about bringing peace to post-Soviet areas. Russia, 
however, is willing to participate in U.N. and CSCE peacekeeping 
operations in the territory of the former USSR. 
  Thus, as stressed in the joint statement issued by the MO 
[Ministry of Defense] and the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], 
Russia is not pitting its efforts against anyone at all. We are 
not demanding that we be accorded a special position or 
exclusive role. However, Russia at the same time has no 
intention of backing away from her responsibility for her 
position in this key geographic area.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant-General Leonid Zolotov by </F>
Aleksandr Oliynik, place and date not given: "Still on the 
Agenda"] 
  [Text] The maintenance of military discipline and 
order at a high level today, when the difficult process of 
reform of the Armed Forces is in progress and a mixed manning 
principle is being introduced, is a task of special importance. 
The Chief of Staff of the Moscow Military District, Lt-Gen 
Leonid Zolotov, tells how things now stand in this most 
important area in the Moscow Military District. 
  [Oliynik] Leonid Sergeyevich, for the first time in recent 
years the district military council, at which the problems of 
military discipline and order were considered individually, 
certified that the number of military crimes and incidents 
decreased by a factor of one-and-a-half in comparison with 1992 
in the units and formations, and that the number of draft 
dodgers decreased by a factor of more than six. How was this 
achieved? 
  [Zolotov] The short answer is that the entire spectrum of 
problems of strengthening discipline and order in the units has 
constantly been the focus of activity of the CINC, staff, 
directorates, and services of the district. As required by the 
well-known order of the Defense Minister of the Russian 
Federation of 18 November 1993, we seek to ensure that work to 
strengthen discipline and organization is not reduced to a 
short-lived campaign, that in each military outfit an atmosphere 
of high demands and responsibility is constantly maintained, and 
that every violation receives a strict and principled 
assessment. As I see it, this is the main reason for the 
successes in our foremost units and formations. 
  For example, take the signals brigade where Colonel 
Aleksandr 
Semenovich Semakin is the commander. The conditions of service 
there and the contingent of draftees are the same as in other 
units. Perhaps even more signal troops have to work away from 
the unit and participate in various kinds of classes and 
tactical exercises. But despite this, in the last three years 
there has not been a single serious incident there. In the 
military council, incidentally, the CINC Col-Gen Leontiy 
Kuznetsov analyzed the work style of this foremost commander and 
stressed that educational work in the brigade is reinforced by 
an exacting attitude toward the men with respect to regulations, 
combined with concern for them. Colonel Semakin himself and many 
other officers and warrant officers are models of 
industriousness and discipline. Their subordinates see and 
appreciate that. 
  [Oliynik] What difficulties and problems do the commanders 
and staffs encounter in working to strengthen discipline and 
order, and in particular, how does [this work] influence the 
level of combat readiness? 
  [Zolotov] Today probably as never before it is important to 
evaluate the status of observance of regulations not from 
quantitative indices, but primarily from its real influence on 
the combat readiness of troops, and on the quality of combat 
training. Close analysis of the state of military discipline in 
the district's units for last year and for three months of this 
year showed that the level of organizational work of commanders, 
staffers and educational structures unfortunately still does not 
correspond everywhere to the provisions of regulations and to 
the requirements of the Defense Minister and the Chief of the 
General Staff of the Armed Forces. The military council and the 
district staff believe that it is this task of raising the 
disciplining influence of combat training, guard duty, work 
details, etc. that has not been fully accomplished. In this 
regard, I recall the words of the military teacher and leader 
General M. Dragomirov: "Discipline comes from the sum total of 
ethical and legal skills covering the entire content of the 
military goals of the soldier." The chief deficiency is that 
"the sum total of ethical and legal skills" is now by no means 
achieved everywhere. 
  [Oliynik] Could you give a concrete example? 
  [Zolotov] Of course. In early March, Pvt. Sergey Komlev from 
the Taman Division went AWOL from the unit and returned to the 
Ivanov military commissariat which had drafted him. It was 
learned that the soldier had been forced to seek protection at 
home because he could not find it in his company. Here much of 
the blame lies with the company commander Lt. Aleksandr Ebel, 
who was indifferent and ignored the soldier's complaints about 
headaches. The battalion and regimental staffs did not attach 
much importance to this fact. Nor did the deputy commander of 
the battalion for personnel work take the requisite steps. Need 
it be said that such actions by some officers demean the 
prestige of commanders and discredit military order itself? 
  [Oliynik] And how do you explain the fact that while there 
is 
some reduction in the number of crimes and incidents in the 
district, their seriousness has increased? 
  [Zolotov] Yes, this is a difficult question, which 
incidentally we also discussed at the military council of the 
district. To speak the language of numbers, we unfortunately had 
a 13 percent increase in the number of convictions for various 
military crimes, although the number of their participants 
decreased by 50 percent. We do not avoid blame for this, but it 
is not only a question of us. It is well known what sort of 
replacements we are getting now in the army. If we look at the 
statistics, we can see that in recent years every second draftee 
is not prepared for service either in the physical or in the 
moral and psychological context. Who is guilty? The army? Every 
third has serious health problems. The number of persons with 
previous convictions and arrests has increased significantly. 
Representatives of various unofficial associations, including 
those of an extremist and mafioso bent, cause us a great deal of 
concern. That is, all of the sores that afflict our society 
necessarily create a heavy burden on the army as well. Here is 
an example that has already been reported in the press. In the 
Naro-Fominsk garrison, a solder from Moscow, Pvt. Aleksandr 
Fedyunin, went AWOL from his unit. What prompted the soldier to 
do this? It was learned that the notorious "hazing" had been 
eliminated. There were no complaints against him either from his 
commanders or from his comrades in service. Now he has been 
arrested, and the prosecutor is investigating the incident. Of 
course, everything will be found out, but it takes a lot of 
manpower and resources, and people are pulled away from their 
immediate obligations; not to mention the anguish this causes to 
his parents and loved ones. 
  [Oliynik] In connection with the mixed manning of the 
troops, 
I would imaging a new problem has also arisen, the maintenance 
of order among the contract soldiers. Now they number more than 
seven thousand in the district, and soon there will be twice 
that. 
  [Zolotov] You have guessed correctly, there are problems 
with 
discipline even among the contract troops. Judge for yourself. 
Of the 7,360 enlisted and NCOs serving by contract in the 
district units, the command was forced to nullify the contracts 
with 1,266 of them within a month or two after signing, 
basically due to lack of discipline and low moral qualities. 
Despite all efforts, the commanders and staffs to this point 
have not managed to ensure that the contract troops are true 
professionals in military affairs, and serve as an example. 
Analysis shows that educational and legal work with this 
category of service members has still not brought the due 
effect. What is more, in many units there have been sharp 
conflicts with compulsory-service soldiers on matters of pulling 
duty in details and guard mounts and in daily life. A whole 
group of measures was required, involving careful selection of 
people for contract service and adapting them to the conditions 
of present-day military service. Perhaps in the future it would 
be more advisable to man some subunits solely with contractors. 
  [Oliynik] Recently a meeting was held between the Patriarch 
of Moscow and All Russia Aleksey II and the Defense Minister of 
the Russian Federation, General of the Army Pavel Grachev. A 
coordinating council for the resolution of questions of 
cooperation between the Orthodox Church and the army was formed. 
In your view, will this help to improve the moral climate in the 
military outfits, and prevent law-violations in them? 
  [Zolotov] I think so. Now when many moral criteria have been 
lost and ideals are blurred, as we work to educate personnel we 
cannot help but use the rich moral and ethical capabilities of 
the Orthodox Church and other religious faiths. For these 
purposes, a special plan has been worked out in the units of the 
district, aimed at close coordination of the units with the 
clergy in the provinces. In particular, it is recommended that 
commanders of formations and units define procedures for 
arranging religious services for believers and members of their 
families outside the military garrisons in their free time. In 
the period of reception of the new replacements and on the days 
when the military oath is taken, priests will be invited to the 
units, and spiritual literature will appear in the barracks. In 
short, we hope that reliance on religion will justify itself, 
and in particular will influence the education of the men and 
their moral qualities. 
  In conclusion I want to stress that the army, as our entire 
society, has come up against a whole group of problems that must 
be resolved within the framework of military reform. And the 
strengthening of military discipline and order is one of these. 
Much has already been done toward this end. But whatever the 
successes, the question of strengthening discipline will never 
be off the agenda, so to speak. Education is a continuous 
process, and its ultimate goal is to bring the army together and 
raise its combat readiness.

<F P=106> [Interview of Captain 3rd Rank (Res.) Mikhail Kolchev by </F>
Vyacheslav Mamontov, place and time not indicated: "Why a 
Military Trade Union?"] 
  [Text] A lot has been said and written lately about 
the Independent Trade Union of Service Members (NPSV). Press 
attention was drawn to it by the scandalous departure of one of 
the leaders from the organization and his announcement of the 
self-dissolution of the NPSV. This incident also interested me. 
Especially since two years ago, as soon as the trade union 
appeared, I prepared the first article in the military press 
about it. How then are things going with the public association 
of service members today? What problems is the NPSV resolving in 
the field of social protection of the man in shoulder boards? I 
asked the Chairman of the Central Committee of the NPSV, Captain 
3rd Rank (Res.) Mikhail Kolchev to talk about this. 
  [Mamontov] Mikhail Ivanovich, two years ago, in instituting 
the military trade union, you made a loud statement about 
independence in its name. From what did you want to be 
independent? From the Defense Ministry? From the existing system 
of resolving the social problems of service members? 
  [Kolchev] Indeed, the name of our organization was perceived 
by many in the literal sense. But we were trying primarily to 
say to service members that we intended seriously and in a 
businesslike manner to work at the protection of their 
professional, socioeconomic, and spiritual rights and interests. 
And in these things one can hardly succeed by relying solely on 
oneself. For this reason, we immediately began to establish 
contacts not only with the state organs, but also with the 
public associations that have set themselves the task of social 
protection of service members. We proposed to them that we join 
forces. The reply was a simple one: "Every man for himself." We 
came forward with the initiative to create a supervisory 
council, consisting of the representatives of public 
organizations of service members, for monitoring the expenditure 
of the resources received from the sale of written-off military 
equipment. It was calculated that by selling just one submarine, 
we could provide housing to all the apartment-less officers in 
Moscow. But this too turned out to be something no one needed. 
So we resolve our tasks by our own efforts, naturally without 
refusing the assistance of interested departments and 
organizations. In this context, we have established close 
contacts with the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Social 
Protection, the Federal Employment Service, and the Russian 
Union of Veterans of Afghanistan. 
  [Mamontov] But after all, things did not develop smoothly 
between you and the Defense Ministry at first. 
  [Kolchev] I won't deny it. Bureaucrats turned up who, upon 
learning about our existence, tried to put a spike in the wheel. 
In accordance with the Law on Trade Unions, the ministries and 
departments are obliged to sign collective contracts for each 
year with the labor collectives (in the army these are military 
units). We sent all the constituent and organizational documents 
in this regard to the Defense Ministry, but they were 
pigeon-holed. They began to procrastinate, which we saw as an 
attempt to close the trade union. Military jurists joined the 
fray and tried to prove the unsoundness of our organization from 
the legal standpoint. 
  It was hard to guess where it would all end. But we found a 
quite simple solution. We prepared all of our programs and 
documents and wangled a reception with the defense minister. 
After becoming acquainted with our materials, Pavel Sergeyevich 
supported us. The approaches to resolution of the urgent 
problems of the army proposed by the trade union were a surprise 
to him. By all appearances, someone had given him non-objective 
information about us, which boiled down to [saying] that people 
had come together in the military trade union to fill their 
pockets at the army's expense. 
  [Mamontov] How do the rank-and-file members feel about these 
initiatives of the central committee of the military trade union? 
  [Kolchev] They support us completely. We keep them 
constantly 
informed about our work by sending out informational digests to 
the primary organizations. I have to say that the number of 
members of the NPSV is growing constantly. Recently "newcomers" 
have turned up in Kaliningrad, Orel, Voronezh, Liyepaya, St. 
Petersburg, Kursk, Samara, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Khabarovsk. 
  In order to combine efforts in social protection of service 
members, we have put forward an initiative for creation of a 
Federation of Trade Unions of the Power Ministries and 
Departments, and also put forward proposals to the corresponding 
authorities regarding the creation of trade unions of the Border 
Troops, the MB RF [Russian Federation Ministry of Security], the 
tax police, the customs committee, and the Cossack formations. 
Now there are already organizational committees formed to hold 
constituent conferences for these trade unions. 
  [Mamontov] Judging from the available information, the trade 
union is more known for its construction work. 
  [Kolchev] We are indeed greatly involved in supplying 
housing 
to service members. And here we have achieved some results. For 
example, jointly with the International Migration Commission 
(MMK) we have devised a program for construction of housing and 
social adaptation of service members. Its essence lies in the 
integrated resolution of the housing problem and retraining of 
officers and warrant officers, discharged to the reserves, for 
civilian specialties with allowance for the desires and needs of 
the regions for particular professions. The program also 
provides for allocation of resources to service members for 
organization and development of their own affairs. 
Implementation of the program began with the signing last year 
of a contract to finance housing construction with the Agency 
for International Development (AMR), which represents the 
interests of the U.S. State Department, and a contractor, the 
Fund for Financial Support of Small enterprises, which is a 
structural component of the NPSV. After this, an additional 
contract was signed between the AMR, the MMK and the NPSV for 
the retraining of discharged service members. The work done in 
this area by the trade union is unique in its way. You see, for 
the first time investment funds are being sent directly to the 
contractors, bypassing the state distribution channels. 
  But we are building housing not only with help from abroad. 
We are trying to find a construction contractor and a sponsor, 
and are finding parcels of land and signing contracts. For 
instance, we were able to reach an agreement with the Murmansk 
Nickel Combine for payment of construction for housing for 
officers of the Northern Fleet using their products. We found a 
company that would buy the nickel and pay the expenses for 
construction. The result: 20 families of the Northern Fleet 
members will have well-appointed housing. And the NPSV will 
receive nothing for itself from this. 
  Naturally we understand that we cannot stick solely to 
apartment problems. We also have other accomplishments. For 
instance, in seeking to expand participation of the military in 
privatization, we went to the government with a proposal to 
provide state support to the association "Russian Business 
Center of Reserve Service Members" organized by the NPSV. The 
association was to assume full responsibility for social 
adaption of former service members in a number of regions of 
Russia. A draft order of the RF government was prepared 
regarding the creation of a network of production enterprises on 
the basis of the military camps freed up as a result of army 
reform, with the participation of discharged service members and 
their family members. Even now we have several such camps to our 
credit and are beginning work to implement this project. 
  The military trade union has established the "Military 
Investment Company," which is opening up the prospect of 
financing our further programs for social and general living 
arrangements of service members. Besides this, we have now begun 
implementing the international project "Russian Life" to create 
a military insurance company of the West European type, and are 
also working to implement the concept of a non-state pension 
fund for former service members. 
  [Mamontov] The military trade union is two years old. That 
is 
pretty young. It is true that you have a lot of work to do. But 
surely you didn't undertake this work for the sake of building 
apartments for discharged military, and creating different kinds 
of funds? 
  [Kolchev] The problems which we must deal with today 
naturally do not have to be inherent to the military trade 
union. Construction of housing, the retraining of discharged 
service members, these are state tasks. In the future we intend 
to ensure that they remain so. Through the legislative 
initiative which the military trade union possesses, in contrast 
to other public associations, we will defend the professional, 
socioeconomic, and spiritual rights and interests of service 
members. You see, now many different documents are appearing 
which infringe on the rights of the military, do not correspond 
to the provisions of the Constitution, and violate the generally 
accepted norms of human rights and freedoms. So we have no end 
of work ahead of us. And we have already set about doing it. We 
have prepared and sent to the government documents in which we 
ask the state to assume the obligation of providing servicemen 
with housing. 
  But ideally, the work of the trade union must boil down to 
accomplishment of middleman functions between the Defense 
Ministry and the persons signing the contract for performance of 
military service. Here we will have to ensure compliance with 
the terms of the contract, by providing legal, juridical, and 
social assistance to service members, and protecting their 
interests in different conflict situations with their employer. 
Without interfering in the principle of one-man command. As you 
see, it is a subtle and complex problem. And we have to be 
serious about it. For that reason we hope that the service 
members will support us in every way. After all, only by 
combining our efforts can we obtain respect for the army and for 
the military man, and be able to live and do our duty to the 
Motherland worthily. 
  [Mamontov] Thanks for the talk, and good luck in your work.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Petr Belov, candidate of technical </F>
sciences: "Who Needs the SS-25 Missiles?" 
  [Text] A report recently appeared in the press that it has 
been decided to base the nuclear missile power of the future 
Russia on missiles of the "modernized SS-25 type." The optimum 
nature of such an important decision was confirmed by the 
opinion of the editor's office of the newspaper that is most 
read by intellectuals, which considers the SS-25 to be "one of 
the most successful mobile ground missile systems," and also by 
statements from a top scientist, an acting member and a 
corresponding member of several academies. 
  I admit that the decision to enter into polemics with 
respect 
to the correctness of such a choice did not come about 
immediately. Disturbing were the great authority of the 
indicated opponents, the author's lack of the corresponding 
scientific titles, and the difficulty that most readers would 
have in following the unavoidable factual details in the 
arguments. But should one remain silent if the consequences of 
this decision affect all of us in the most direct way? 
Especially since the references to authority are less convincing 
in comparison with the conclusions obtained below with the help 
of certain facts and laws. 
<H5>  Is Rearmament Necessary at All? </H5>
  I remind you that in the event of the ratification of the 
treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation on 
the reduction of strategic offensive arms (START II) we will 
have to reduce the total number of nuclear warheads to 
3,000-3,500, of which 1,700-1,750 nuclear warheads will have to 
be deployed on submarines and the rest on heavy bombers and 
single-warhead ground-based missiles. The traditional 
superiority of the United States in aviation and the navy will 
force Russia to do all it can to preserve the combat capability 
of ground-based missiles even to the point of arming them with 
the maximum allowed 1,300 nuclear warheads. At the present time, 
however, we do not have that many single-warhead missiles and 
will scarcely be able to produce them by 2003. 
  Taking into account the approximately 300 mobile land-based 
single-warhead SS-25 missiles now in existence and 195 
multiple-warhead SS-18's and SS-19's permitted for conversion, 
Russia will be forced to build approximately another 800 new 
missiles. Alternative decisions may be the following: Not to 
build any new land-based missiles but limit ourselves to the 500 
that exist now and the same number of nuclear warheads on old 
bombers; begin to build new single-warhead missiles, not all 800 
but half that many. My opponents favor precisely the latter 
version, proposing that 60-70 percent of the missiles be in the 
form of modernized mobile SS-25's and the rest in silos. 
  The questions arise: Do we need the fortunately still 
unratified START II Treaty and in developing a new nuclear 
missile program should we proceed on the basis of its 
injunctions that are unacceptable for us? Who really needs SS-25 
missiles that the media have praised? Can it really be that we 
cannot do without these "safe to operate" and "very economical" 
mobile complexes, which "do not burn in fire," "do not break 
apart on rocky ground," and "cannot be penetrated by various 
kinds of weapons"? And is not this campaign just the latest 
monstrous disinformation inflicted on the public? 
  In response to these questions, we will point out still 
another alternative--to refuse to ratify START II until there 
has been a thorough investigation of all the peculiarities of 
the rearming that it imposes, a comprehensive evaluation of the 
real performance characteristics of the SS-25, and an 
elucidation of the possibility of its improvement through 
modernization. At the same time, it should be remembered that 
the only reliable means of deterring an aggressor in the next 10 
years is our multiple-warhead missiles in silos rather than the 
aging submarines and strategic bombers. The SS-25's under review 
here are inferior to such missiles in every parameter without 
exception--safety in operation, economy, and survivability; we 
will become convinced of this in a systematic way. 
<H5>  Are the SS-25's Really So Safe for Us? </H5>
  The most significant shortcoming of mobile land-based 
(ground 
and railroad) strategic missiles is the danger from the nuclear 
warheads that they have and from the extremely toxic and 
explosive missile fuel. The threat of the occurrence of 
accidents with catastrophic nuclear contamination of the terrain 
was the reason why every country except Russia renounced such 
missiles. For a fire is possible in a collision with an SS-25 
and this is the most probable cause of the explosion of the 
conventional explosive material in the nuclear warhead and the 
dispersion of radioactive plutonium. A burning nuclear warhead 
of a land-based missile cannot be extinguished by on-board 
water, as at sea, and cannot be dropped, as from an airplane. 
And this will take place on well-traveled roads rather than in 
the "far seas" or "way up in the sky." 
  It can also be asserted that fundamentally missiles of the 
SS-25 type cannot possess a high degree of safety while on the 
move. At least their safety is always less than that of naval 
and air delivery systems of nuclear warheads, not to mention 
stationary missiles in silos. Indeed, for the SS-25, it is 
significantly more difficult to preclude collisions with outside 
means of transport or the intentional or natural destruction of 
the road surface--at least because of the great accessibility of 
these missiles for outside persons in comparison with submarines 
on patrol and bombers. Just as obvious is the threat of other 
preconditions for accidents (driver error and breakdown of the 
vehicle) that do not exist in silo launch facilities where there 
are no people around. 
  In this connection, the arguments for the safety of the 
present SS-25's linked with the mention of eight submarine 
disasters and the absence of such in the Strategic Missile 
Forces seem strange. The significantly larger number of 
submarines on patrol and the duration of these patrols is 
thereby ignored and no mention is made of the fact of serious 
accidents with the overturning of more than 10 missiles of the 
SS-25 type that took them out of action, fortunately without 
nuclear warheads burning or exploding. The quantitative 
assessments of the probability of accidents with SS-25's that 
the opponents have presented are quite erroneous: They have been 
underestimated by a factor of more than 10 in terms of one 
system per year and by a factor of 40 for the entire grouping of 
500 missiles. 
  It is likewise impossible to agree with the assertions about 
the so-called safety of solid-fuel SS-25's and SS-24's. Why, 
then, is it recommended to personnel that they quickly abandon 
them in the event of a fire and move away to a distance of 2.5 
km? Nor have people forgotten the explosion of the solid-fuel 
boosters of the American "Challenger" with the loss of seven 
astronauts and the tragedy in 1988 at the SS-24 assembly plant, 
which had to stop its work for a long time. The most frightening 
thing, however, as specialists at Arzamas-16 have shown, is the 
spontaneous start-up of the engines of the solid-fuel SS-25, for 
it is impossible to stop or knock down this monster flying over 
the earth. And it can fly to Moscow from that same Teykovo 
Kostromskaya Oblast. Basically this could not happen with 
liquid-fuel missiles. 
<H5>  About the Economy of Operation of the SS-25 </H5>
  Another argument in favor of the optimum nature of the 
building of new mobile missiles of the SS-25 type, in the 
opinion of their supporters, is their high degree of economy 
compared with the cost of stationary missiles. Such an assertion 
is fair, but only in part. It is not difficult to be convinced 
of this by examining in turn the expenditures necessary for the 
building and operation of different types of missiles and 
comparing them. 
  Yes, the deployment of SS-25's in the position areas of the 
silo missiles SS-17 and SS-18 to be destroyed will provide for a 
certain saving of funds: There are roads, towns, engineering 
structures, and communications. Instead of expensive silos, it 
will be necessary to build only ground garages with movable 
roofs for the launch of the missiles in the event of an extreme 
emergency. But is such an economy necessary if the volume of the 
previous network of roads is inadequate for the dispersion of 
SS-25's at safe distances and if you cannot move very fast on 
dirt roads? In such a case, all of the SS-25's will be the easy 
prey of naval "Tridents" even with less accurate and powerful 
nuclear warheads. 
  And the assertions of the low operating cost of 
single-warhead ground-mobile missiles do not stand up to any 
sort of criticism. Taking into account the depreciation costs of 
the vehicle chassis, the network of roads, and the engineering 
structures as well as the expenditures for fuel and lubricants 
and the development and guarding of the patrol routes, the loses 
from disruptions in the transport of freight needed in the 
national economy, and the results of possible disasters, the 
operation of the SS-25 will be just as devastating as the use of 
strategic bombers and nuclear submarines. 
  A special category of expenditures has to do with need for a 
large number of operating personnel, which one must not fail to 
consider with the growing shortage of service members. Where can 
Russia obtain additional tens of thousands of people and what 
will they cost? 
  Nor should there be any illusions with respect to the low 
cost of converting SS-25 launch silos. For the reconstruction of 
a huge silo to suit a small missile will be just as costly as 
the construction of a new one. This will require work to uncover 
and revise numerous communication lines, the replacement of 
obsolete equipment, and the use of colossal amounts of concrete 
and the best kinds of cement and metal. And it is all senseless, 
because it will not give the silo the required survivability: 
The smaller the silo is, the more resistant it is to external 
influences. 
<H5>  Are SS-25's Dangerous for the Enemy? </H5>
  Is it possible that the shortcomings noted above are more 
than compensated by the potential merits of the SS-25--its high 
degree of protection against any counteraction by the enemy and 
timely maneuvering? Indeed, in principle the mobile means of 
basing strategic missiles guarantees their invulnerability but 
under these conditions: If they are small in size, protected 
against outside influences, placed in containers camouflaged as 
normal freight, dispersed throughout Russia, and constantly or 
periodically change their location randomly. 
  Precisely this was the original intention of the creators of 
the SS-25 and it is precisely this desirable feature that its 
advocates are striving to present as reality. As a matter of 
fact, they were not successful in keeping it small and the 
camouflaging and continuous patrolling is impossible in 
principle and forbidden by the START I treaty that we have 
already ratified. Also, it is doubtful whether one can speak of 
random changes in the location of these missiles. The 
cross-sectional stability is quite unsatisfactory, the extremely 
high axial loads have rigidly restricted them to a limited 
number of roads for dispersal, and the great weight of the 
missiles along with the small power of the traction engine 
prevented flexible maneuvering through speed. We note that 
everything enumerated above is also fair for the railroad 
SS-24's that again exist only in Russia. 
  Hence it follows that with the knowledge of the permanent 
deployment sites (provided by START I), the unique unmasking 
features of ground-mobile missiles (this same treaty prohibits 
changes in form), and the existing means of space 
reconnaissance, the enemy has no problem in determining the 
present location of our ground-mobile missiles and in 
forecasting their coordinates in the next 15 minutes. Under 
these conditions, the SS-25's and SS-24's are more vulnerable 
than stationary missiles in silos and even bombers and 
submarines in ports. 
  Indeed, the enormous size of the transport-launch container 
with the missile (the area of the external surfaces is more than 
120 square meters) did not permit their being made of metal, 
which would require an additional increase in weight of hundreds 
of tonnes and would definitively deprive these missiles of 
mobility. In turn, the large lateral "sails" estimated at an 
area of 100 square meters or more as well as the inadmissibly 
narrow width of the track greatly facilitated the overturning of 
our ground-mobile missiles through excessive aerodynamic 
pressure. All of this made it much easier for them to be 
disabled through a powerful electromagnetic pulse, all sorts of 
firearms, and even simple overturning. But it is easiest of all 
to achieve the destruction of the patrolling ground-mobile 
missiles with the help of sabotage. For this it is sufficient to 
have several specially trained "switchmen" or explosive devices 
set up in advance near the probable routes that are tuned to the 
emissions of the moving SS-25's and activated from space. 
  And in the most extreme case, for the destruction of the 
mobile missiles that have miraculously survived, it is possible 
to utilize missiles of submarines cruising near enough to 
deliver their nuclear warheads to the position areas of the 
SS-25's within 15 minutes. Calculations show that in this time 
they will be unable to leave the range of their destruction 
through shock wave factors. 
  A comparison of the survivability parameters of mobile and 
stationary land-based strategic missiles indicates the 
preferability of the latter. Indeed, silo missiles are 
guaranteed protection against the electromagnetic pulse, 
firearms, and highly accurate conventional and nuclear weapons: 
Their reliable destruction requires an average of 10-15 cruise 
missiles with conventional explosive charges or 2.4 nuclear 
warheads. Taking into account the impossibility of destroying 
silos simultaneously through several nuclear warheads 
("fratricidal effect"), the preclusion of their delivery through 
high-speed low-angle trajectories (which reduces the possibility 
of hitting and destroying hardened launchers), the high combat 
readiness of stationary missiles, and their great distance from 
the borders of Russia, the multiple-warhead SS-18's that we have 
in silos are capable of fulfilling their intended purpose even 
if it is just 5 percent of those left for the retaliatory 
strike, not to mention preventive and counter 
[otvetno-vstrechnyy] strikes. The ground-mobile SS-25 and SS-24 
missiles now in existence are suitable at most for a first 
strike. So are not they (rather than multiple-warhead silo 
missiles) the "destabilizing" missiles that the United States so 
fears? 
<H5>  Is Modernization of the SS-25 Realistic? </H5>
  Since the new nuclear missile program involves modernized 
missiles of the SS-25 type, it is appropriate to analyze the 
possibilities of a fundamental improvement of existing 
ground-mobile complexes. Otherwise the arguments presented above 
may be rejected as not corresponding to the systems under 
development. The unconditional acknowledgement of the reality of 
their qualitative improvement is fraught with the danger of 
senseless economic outlays that are completely unacceptable in 
our time. 
  I dare to assert that the task of freeing mobile missiles of 
the SS-25 type from their shortcomings is not soluble in the 
next decade. The reasons for this are not only economic but also 
technical, organizational, and political. If we do not 
understand this, then once again the billions required for the 
modernization of the SS-25 will be totally wasted. 
  In the foreseeable future, we will be technically unable to 
build a miniature intercontinental missile and guarantee its 
invulnerability through the means examined above. The reason for 
this is the more and more frightening technological backwardness 
of the military-industrial complex and the prohibitions in START 
I. 
  Organizationally, it is presently impossible to raise the 
discipline of the movement of traffic on the roads of Russia or 
to improve the state of the roads and the safety standards for 
the entire population of the country. It is likewise impossible 
to interfere endlessly with the movement of national economic 
transportation or to establish an alienation zone around the 
patrol routes to reduce the danger of sabotage and the severity 
of possible accidents. It is equally unreasonable to keep mobile 
missile complexes at bases permanently and hope that they will 
be allowed to leave them in a threatening period. 
  Politically, it is hardly admissible to contribute to an 
increase in social tension--to raise the degree to which the 
people living near bases and the patrol routes of SS-25's are 
informed about the serious danger that threatens them. It is 
equally obvious that is unethical to keep citizens permanently 
ignorant of the terrible threat against them and not to prepare 
them in time to take action under the conditions of possible 
extreme situations. 
  The question arises: Why did the advocates of the SS-25 
ignore these rather important aspects? Or is it possible that 
the author of these lines is wrong and there is no problem with 
the SS-25? Then why does no one refute him in a public 
discussion? But to be fair, I will note that that there were 
three published articles denying the danger of these missile 
systems for us. True, their authors presented incorrect 
arguments to justify their positions, but on the other hand, 
they did not forget to stress their own high scientific and 
official rank and in some cases involvement in the creation of 
the SS-25. 
  Still, in the opinion of independent experts, the problem 
with the SS-25 is extremely pressing. Moreover, every effort is 
being made to hush it up, which suits very influential forces: 
Our "partner" in START II, who is prepared to utilize them as 
his own "Colt" that is already aimed at the heart of Russia; the 
generals from industry and the army who still hold their high 
posts; the corporate interests of a well-known group in the 
military-industrial complex that receives orders amounting to 
many billions for a mobile missile technology that is needed by 
it but not by the taxpayer; and the command of the Strategic 
Missile Forces that is striving to maintain the size of its 
staff and the number of generals' billets. 
  No, Russia has no need for START II and the SS-25 that are 
being imposed on it, neither for those in existence nor for 
modernized versions. Their acceptance will plunge the country 
into the next spiral of rearmament. The result is obvious--two 
zeros at the same time: The final destruction of the economy and 
the total loss of the country's defensive capability. So is it 
not better to realize what is happening in time and not to allow 
such a prospect? The time is not yet past.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Yarynich, candidate of military </F>
sciences: "Nuclear Strategies and the Control Factor"] 
  [Text] It is gratifying when from time to time our press 
publishes articles like that of V. Belous on the nuclear 
strategy of Russia (SEGODNYA, 9 February 1994). It is not even a 
matter of the content of the article, with some of the positions 
of which I do not totally agree. It is something else that is 
gratifying--our public is getting a greater opportunity to know 
and consequently, perhaps, to influence the resolution of 
vitally important and costly tasks. The time is receding into 
the past when fundamental decisions on questions of nuclear 
strategy and national security were the responsibility only of a 
closed military-political elite. 
  There is no need to fear that the involvement of independent 
experts and simply interested persons in this process will 
accidentally open up something that is truly forbidden--this can 
always be avoided. Moreover, in this connection the area of 
nuclear arms has a unique nature dictated by the absurdity of 
the unleashing of a nuclear war. In my view, this permits and 
even demands much greater openness than in the area of 
conventional arms. 
  In the mentioned article, V. Belous covered the strategies 
for the use of nuclear forces rather broadly and showed their 
dependence on the structure of the triad and the basic technical 
parameters of the weapons. But such an important factor as 
control plays an extremely important role precisely in the 
question of strategies for use. The possibility of 
implementation in the event of the necessity of a launch on 
warning [otvetno-vstrechnyy udar] or launch under attack 
[otvetnyy udar] (OVU and OU, respectively) depends to a decisive 
degree on the structure and characteristics of the control 
system. The author is correct when he speaks of significant 
inertia in the process of the development of strategic nuclear 
forces. This also applies fully to the control system--grouping 
of command posts of all levels, communications network, and 
complex with the corresponding computer facilities. The 
expenditures for them are commensurate with the outlays for the 
weapons themselves, and hence there must be close coordination 
of questions involving control, the combat capabilities of the 
weapons, and the means of using them as a unified whole. 
  If one analyzes the strategy for the use of the strategic 
nuclear forces from the position of control, then the following 
may be noted: It is obvious that there are no and in the future 
will not be any particular difficulties with the command and 
control of a first nuclear strike if, of course, we are forced 
into it. I share the point of view of V. Belous about the 
theoretical admissibility of such actions on our part under 
extraordinary circumstances, although the determination of the 
conditions under which the use of nuclear weapons may somehow be 
justified is a very complex and delicate problem. In any event, 
in this point the new Russian military doctrine (with all of its 
other shortcomings in a number of other questions) appears more 
logical than the previous declaration that we would not be the 
first to use nuclear weapons. In my view, that declaration did 
not have any practical value for one simple reason: Any 
"right-thinking" potential aggressor cannot in his plans for 
attack bet on such promises by the potential victim; he is 
obliged to count on the worst for himself. My only objection to 
the author in this matter from the position of command and 
control is that submarines and mobile ground complexes are no 
less suitable for a first strike than are missiles in silos. 
  As for the concept of a launch on warning, here everything 
appears substantially more complex. Yes, today and in the 
foreseeable future the United States may rely on it along with 
other versions of the use of its nuclear forces. For Russia, 
such a strategy appears quite doubtful even now and all the more 
so in the future. The reasons are well known: The disintegration 
of the unified network of the missile attack warning system 
(half of the ground radar is now in the near abroad); our 
leadership has less time than does that of the Americans to make 
a decision (actually no more than 2-3 minutes) in the event of a 
strike from submarines in the Norwegian or Mediterranean Seas; 
the obligation of the president of Russia to coordinate his 
actions in an extreme situation with the leadership of Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, and Belorussia, etc. But besides the "perforated" 
missile attack warning system and the rigid time limits, there 
are several other reasons that put into doubt the correctness of 
nuclear strategy relying on the concept of a launch on warning. 
  In the first place, the tendency in the reorganization of 
the 
Russian strategic nuclear forces in accordance with the START II 
Treaty is such that by the beginning of the next millenium the 
predominant role (in terms of the number of warheads) in their 
structure will begin to be played by the most survivable 
components--submarines and mobile land-based missiles. Such a 
structure of forces will be less able than today's structure to 
justify the need for haste in retaliatory actions. In other 
words, the calculated capacities of launch on warning and launch 
under attack will tend to converge. 
  Secondly, as V. Belous justifiably notes, the realization of 
the agreement on the mutual nonaiming of missiles leads in 
practically any version to abandonment of the strategy of launch 
on warning. The deeper is the reciprocal lowering of the 
readiness of the nuclear forces of the sides, the more time will 
be required for its prompt restoration in a crisis situation. It 
is difficult to expect the participants in such a sprint to 
reach the finish line simultaneously. And since the time limit 
for reflection is already used up today, delay by one side of 
even a few minutes will automatically put it in the category of 
a launch under attack. To be specific, as a result of all that 
has been said, today Russia essentially already finds itself in 
this framework and the concept of launch on warning is becoming 
more and more theoretical, although it does maintain its 
previous deterrent influence. 
  Such an objectively existing reorientation of the axes of 
nuclear strategy does not appear to be accidental. It is 
possible that in our time the general change in strategic 
thinking, the agreement with respect to a common scale of human 
values, and the development of ties dictate a renunciation of 
equilibrium on the razor's edge. In principle, the very idea of 
an immediate and impulsive nuclear reaction to the information 
from technical means of warning (even if they are "absolutely" 
reliable) seems absurd. What is needed is a second, insuring 
basis that in a hypothetical crisis situation would give the 
right to make a mistake to those people who are responsible for 
the decision. The strategy of launch under attack is such an 
insuring support. 
  But here is what is interesting. Following simple logic, we 
will immediately come to this question: If the grouping of 
nuclear forces and the system for its control, being oriented 
toward the concept of launch under attack, guarantee reliable 
deterrence, then why does one need enormous expenditures to 
support even the possibility of a launch on warning? Of course 
it is impossible to separate these things completely, and it is 
not necessary. Even under the concept of a launch under attack, 
for example, the role of the missile attack warning system will 
remain important, in particular, for the issue of warning 
information and identification of the aggressor country. Nor 
does the task of making decisions and sanctioning disappear. But 
there is a question, as they say, and one must seek to answer 
it. In any case, the problem of the changeover to a strategy of 
launch under attack as the primary basis for deterrence appears 
pressing today. This change cannot be accomplished immediately. 
Ideological and technical studies will be required on a national 
scale as well as at the international level, because by its very 
essence nuclear deterrence has a bilateral (multilateral) 
nature. Let us briefly examine the main difficulties and tasks 
on this path. 
  The concept of launch under attack was always criticized and 
is being criticized now under two main criteria: The low 
retaliatory power (especially later on with deep cuts in 
strategic offensive weapons) and the large probability of the 
complete failure of retaliation because of the preventive 
decapitation of the command and control sytem. The scope of a 
newspaper article does not allow a full illumination of this 
aspect and therefore we will limit ourselves to a conclusion. 
The whole essence of the question is how in the case at hand to 
deal with the notions of "little" and "much." Formerly, each 
side made such an assessment independently, although from a 
mathematical point of view it is a matter of the risk of the 
partner and it would not be a bad thing to consider what he 
thinks about this. I personally assume that if the American 
"partner" were suddenly to plan a surprise nuclear strike 
against Russia, he would be deterred by the possibility of the 
retaliation, let us say, of 10-15 warheads with a probability of 
0.1-0.2. Of course, these figures are taken as an example, but 
they make one think. Just recently, closed as well as open 
scientific investigations demonstrated the necessity of a launch 
under attack using several hundred warheads with a "guaranteed" 
probability. (One must assume 100 percent!?) 
  Such considerations could appear scholastic if behind all of 
this were not specific structures and levels of nuclear forces, 
groupings of command posts, and automated systems for control 
and communications, that is, a great deal of public money. I 
think that it is practically impossible to achieve a calculated 
probability of retaliation at a level higher than 90 percent: We 
lack the means to create such a system of command and control. 
Fortunately, it is not necessary to do this. Magnitudes of 
0.6-0.7 will be more than adequate for deterrence, which appears 
more realistic even under the possibilities that we have today 
and gives a certain amount of confidence in the reasonableness 
of the switch to the concept of launch under attack. 
  Besides the indicated general assessment, a change to the 
concept of launch under attack will also require an analysis of 
the controllability of each component of the prospective 
structure of the Russian nuclear forces. And here a very 
voluminous and complex task comes on the agenda. By 2003 half of 
all nuclear warheads will be on board submarines. But the naval 
component of the Russian strategic nuclear forces is 
significantly harder to control than the Strategic Missile 
Forces. It turns out that we are undertaking a drastic reduction 
of those forces that have the most survivable and operative 
commmand and control system, and at the same time we are 
increasing our reliance on submarines, although it is well known 
what a complicated technical problem it is today reliably to 
deliver an order to a great depth under combat conditions. Our 
unprotected transmitting radio communications centers in the 
superlong-wave band are essentially the only means that we have 
to resolve this task but they substantially more vulnerable to 
conventional weapons than are analogous systems in the United 
States. All of this means that after the realization of the 
START II Treaty, with apparent external parity of forces, 
actually the power of our strategic nuclear forces will be 
substantially less. 
  There can be only two ways out: Either do not reduce the 
Strategic Missiles Forces or resolve the problem of dependable 
control of the naval component. Since it is impossible to stop 
the process of nuclear disarmament, the second choice remains. 
The fact of the existence of the problem of the control of 
submarines is the result of many years of underestimating this 
component, whereas primary attention was always given to the 
development of the missile forces. For this reason, as of today 
the Strategic Missile Forces have been most successful in 
resolving questions in the guaranteeing of control under the 
conditions of launch under attack. The technical work that the 
missile forces have done in several projects could also be 
utilized to resolve the problem of getting commands to deep 
submarines. This would make it possible to accelerate the 
establishment of a unified command of the Russian strategic 
nuclear forces, which appears expedient to ensure more nearly 
optimum use of nuclear weapons under the conditions of deep cuts 
in them. 
  The changeover to the concept of launch under attack is not 
limited to military-technical and economic aspects. Also 
required will be the continuous joint work of the "potential 
enemies" to support mutual confidence in the preservation of the 
deterrence factor from both sides. The deep cuts in arms will 
dictate such unusual cooperation. And here it is insufficient 
merely to demonstrate the weapons themselves, but it is also 
necessary to show the possibility of their use in the event of 
the need to do so. This applies in particular to the version in 
which both sides consider the strategy of launch under attack to 
be the main support of deterrence. 
  Showing our deterrent capability to the opposing side 
presupposes a certain degree of openness not only in nuclear 
arms themselves (which to a considerable degree has already been 
achieved today) but also in systems for their command and 
control. It is obvious that two extremes are unacceptable in 
this process: On the one hand, one cannot totally reveal the 
structure and characteristics of the control system, for this 
can increase the provoking aspect and threaten national 
security; but, on the other hand, it is also inadmissible to 
close this area completely, because lack of knowledge can 
gradually give other countries the illusion of Russian nuclear 
impotence, which is fraught with unpredictable consequences in a 
crisis. Apparently, the optimum solution is somewhere in the 
middle. 
  It appears that in the interest of supporting strategic 
stability it would be reasonable, along with the exchange of 
information on nuclear missiles between the sides, to begin a 
dialogue in the area of their command and control. The objective 
of such a conversation is to support confidence in the mutual 
capability of providing for nuclear deterrence under the 
conditions of sharp cuts in arms and taking into account the 
other big changes taking place in the world. This will be 
particularly pressing in the transition to the strategy of 
launch under attack. In the final analysis, such an exchange 
must lead to the development of a methodology for a joint 
quantitative assessment of the minimum necessary level of 
reciprocal deterrence. This would make it possible to reach an 
agreement on deeper reductions of nuclear arsenals and to save 
substantial resources. 
  In the light of everything that has been said above, it 
appears logical for both nuclear superpowers to put their main 
emphasis on the concept of launch under attack as the most 
"humane" concept that corresponds to today's way of thinking and 
to simple logic. It is possible that launch on warning and 
launch under attack could even exchange places in the combat 
documentation at the command posts of the strategic nuclear 
forces. That is, launch under attack would become the basic 
concept and launch on warning an insuring concept. 
  In conclusion, I would like to say that the singularity of 
the problem of nuclear strategies lies in the fact that all of 
their variants will continue to coexist, and this connection I 
agree with the arguments of my respected colleague Vladimir 
Belous.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Oleg Vladykin </F>
under the "Arsenal" rubric: "The Ural Dons Armor"] 
  [Text] The wide troop use of motor vehicles as a means of 
transportation and their employment as a mount for various 
weapons systems comprise a compelling reason to become concerned 
about the protective properties and resistance of vehicles to 
the effects of modern weapons. Tests involving exposure to mine 
explosion, gunfire, and shock waves have revealed, 
unfortunately, the vulnerability of series-produced vehicles to 
the aforementioned effects. 
  The above observations were supported by combat action 
experiences acquired in Afghanistan. Drivers of vehicles moving 
in columns would eventually learn of the bitter experiences 
suffered by comrades who fell victim to mines or were struck by 
bullets while behind the steering wheel. They undertook the 
practice of setting up inside the cabs pieces of armor taken 
from disabled armored personnel carriers. They would install the 
plates on the floor, on the sides, the doors, and sometimes on 
the windshields, leaving only a small port for observation. 
  The above served as the impetus for the concept and 
industrial production of local protection packages for 
series-produced vehicles. The first lot of this kind of 
equipment was subjected to testing even before our troops 
returned from Afghanistan. The protection packages won the 
unqualified approval of military leaders. 
  There are several versions of armor protection for motor 
vehicles. For example, a UAZ-3151 equipped in this manner is 
externally virtually indistinguishable from the standard model 
of this vehicle. In this case, the cab is structurally 
reinforced to take shields made of aircraft armor. Fastened to 
the floor are aluminum alloy shields offering protection against 
shell fragments. A special high-strength fabric fastened to the 
obverse side of the plates reduces ricocheting of secondary 
fragments. In addition, the windshield is replaced by a 
bulletproof version. 
  The Ural-4320 truck, however, is fitted with external armor 
plates, with armor louvers on the windshield (see photo). The 
vulnerable areas are protected in the amount of 55 percent. The 
armor plates are made of steel. Mass of the protection package 
is about 184 kg. 
  Mounted on the interior surfaces of the panels and doors of 
the cab of the KamAZ-4310 are armor plates. Attached to the 
windshield are steel plates with ports. The size of the 
observation window is adjustable by virtue of removable armor 
plates. Seventy percent of the vulnerable areas is given 
protection. Mass of the cab protection package is 285 kg, while 
that of the cab rear is 235 kg. 
  The armor protection package for the truck offers protection 
against bullets 7.62 mm in caliber and fragments with a mass of 
up to 2.0 g. It is stored as a kit that is easily installed on 
the vehicles when the need arises.

<F P=106> [Meeting of Commander-in-Chief Baltic Fleet Admiral </F>
Vladimir Yegorov aboard destroyer Nastoychivyy with ship 
officers not long before service holiday; prepared for press by 
Captain 2nd Rank Yu. Golovin, Baltic Fleet Press Center under 
rubric "From the Horse's Mouth": "Admiral Vladimir Yegorov: I 
Wish You Loyalty"] 
  [Text] Not long before today's holiday there was a 
meeting of Commander-in-Chief Baltic Fleet Admiral V. Yegorov 
with ship officers in the wardroom of the destroyer 
Nastoychivyy. It would appear that the not at all holiday-like 
questions raised during this frank conversation trouble more 
than just its participants... 
  [Audience] Prestige of personnel afloat... It has been 
discussed for a very long time. At one time fleet newspapers 
even started a special rubric, but things did not go beyond 
discussions: It continues to be much more "prestigious" to serve 
ashore than on ships. Is there a hope that the situation finally 
will change? 
  [Yegorov] I am sometimes reproached because of the 
personnel afloat, whose interests of course are paramount. You, 
they say, still are forgetting the personnel ashore... But the 
fact is that as of today there are more than a thousand homeless 
among the ship element. With those housing crumbs we have in the 
Baltic it is very difficult to say how to observe parity in 
distributing it. My position is invariable: The priority must 
remain with personnel afloat. Believe me, this position is 
present in all decisions which I have to make, for if there are 
no ships, there also will be no fleet... 
  Recently, I together with an interdepartmental commission 
headed by Vice Premier Yu. F. Yarov prepared a government 
program with all adjusted figures for construction of housing in 
Kaliningrad Oblast both for the Fleet as well as for the 11th 
Guards Army and a border guard group. Supporting this three-year 
program requires R700 billion in current prices. We are not 
figuring on being allocated such money right away, but even 
one-third would be enough to correct the state of affairs, and 
very significantly. This is the main question for officers and 
warrant officers of ships and staffs of formations afloat. If 
there is a roof over the head, I am sure that service also will 
be normal. 
  I must say that much also depends on you yourselves in 
maintaining and elevating your prestige. Recently, for example, 
I met a young ship's officer who had not gone on leave for 1993. 
Was it really difficult to release him from the ship in good 
time as prescribed? The fact is that today a leave probably is 
one of the few things that supports a person on a ship in 
service, in health, and in contact with the family. One must be 
very attentive to each commander in such questions. If an 
officer has gone on leave, let him rest as prescribed; if he has 
gone ashore, give him the assurance that he will not be called 
except in an emergency. Of course, feedback is needed here as 
well: Each ship's officer must give his commander the assurance 
that he too will not let him down. 
  In short, a genuine ship's family should behave in a family 
way... Especially now. 
  [Audience] Ships need to sail. The professionalism of 
each specialist, the cohesiveness of the crew as a whole, and 
that same question of material support and the prestige of our 
service depend on this. Of course, a ship's long deployment, 
especially for one as large as ours, costs the state dearly. 
Nevertheless, how often will we see the sea this year? 
  [Yegorov] A very important question, and it was 
posed for the chief of the Navy Main Staff during his visit to 
our Fleet. Admiral V. Ye. Selivanov personally named the ships 
which must be sent on combat duty and sent to perform missions 
of official visits. Our counterproposals also were briefed to 
him. One was to send a group of ships to the Northern Fleet for 
an exchange of experience and joint performance of missions. 
This version is fully realistic. Participation of our ships -- 
and under the full program -- in joint Exercise Baltops-94 as 
well as official visits to ports of Belgium and Finland also is 
planned. 
  So you can be sure that my position and that of the Fleet 
Military Council unequivocally coincides with yours: Ships must 
be on long deployments as often as possible, no matter how 
serious the economic situation. We will take advantage of all 
opportunities for this. 
  [Audience] Things are very difficult today with the 
manning of ships and units. Are there hopes for their 
improvement? 
  [Yegorov] The Fleet now is at 65 percent strength 
in authorized first-term positions, and this is double that of 
our Army colleagues. It is of course difficult to compare, 
inasmuch as our specifics differ. Nevertheless, it is possible 
to draw some kind of practical conclusions. One is that 
appropriate positions in our shore units must be manned by women 
on a contract basis and the seamen and petty officers freed up 
from this must be sent aboard ships. And the priority here will 
be given to ships specifically of your formation so they can 
properly maintain technical readiness and perform missions at 
sea. 
  The second path of manpower acquisition is to increase 
contract recruitment for ships. Already today contract personnel 
make up 25 percent of first-term personnel. It is no easy task 
to surround these people with proper attention. The main 
question is where and how are they to live? We can offer them 
nothing for now other than a cabin or crew space. This means we 
must give the contract personnel an opportunity for normal rest 
and normal liberty, but many commanders are not even doing this. 
They are afraid, they say, that the seaman will use the freedom 
clumsily and get drunk... That also happens, but you must 
understand that with all the costs, we must force this new 
institution to live. Remember 1975 for comparison, when warrant 
officers began coming to replace extended-term personnel. Then, 
too, there was much skepticism and even egging on. But the time 
came when they got on their feet and subsequently, including 
also today, turned out to be the most stable part of Fleet 
cadres. Now, for example, we are at 75 percent strength in 
warrant officers. 
  All this experience also must be transferred to work with 
contract personnel, giving special attention to seamen being 
discharged to the reserve. With consideration of removal of 
deferments from certain categories of the draft contingent, we 
are confident that we have the opportunity to improve manning 
significantly. 
  [Audience] More and more often one has occasion to read 
and hear questions such as the following: Inasmuch as the 
military-political situation in the world as a whole and in 
Europe in particular has changed, is it advisable today for 
Russia to have large ships at all here in the Baltic?.. 
  [Yegorov] The situation really has changed. For 
Russia these changes also affected the basing of Fleet forces in 
a most serious manner. We are moving to that minimum which, in 
accordance with the new military doctrine, would allow ensuring 
state interests in the Baltic Sea. Do not forget that favorable 
periods such as the present do not always happen... And the 
defense of Russian borders from sea sectors can be provided only 
by a fleet, especially in the Baltic, inasmuch as our borders 
here now have been moved back. And in contrast to the previous 
status of defense, it is specifically the ships that also are 
given the mission of covering our borders from the air... 
  And after that, genuine fleet service specifically begins 
with shipboard service, with service on 2nd and 1st rank ships; 
our ships cannot and must not limit their functions to 
deployments only in the Baltic Sea... 
  So Russia cannot get by here from any standpoint without 
large ships. 
  Take note: In all the talks on arms and armed forces, the 
Americans, for example, simply exclude their naval forces from 
discussion. They say that the Navy for us is the very same as 
railroads for you in Russia. But we will not forget that Russia 
also was and remains a great naval power, and I am deeply 
convinced that this difficult time will pass and the Russian 
Navy will take its fitting place, for the Navy always was the 
quintessence of the nation. 
  [Audience] If one looks at how much money is being 
allocated for laying down and building new ships and equipment, 
there are few grounds for such optimism... 
  [Yegorov] Funds for maintaining and developing the 
military-industrial complex really are insufficient, especially 
if we compare them with previous times. But there also is no 
longer that gap which existed in 1992... Financing is growing. 
Most important, in my view an understanding already has formed 
"on top" that if we let it go today, we never again will make up 
for it. 
  So I remain an optimist, and I am not the only one, judging 
from the fact that submission of requests by officers to be 
discharged to the reserve practically has stopped... I would 
like to thank you, too, that you are preserving loyalty to your 
profession, to your ship and to our flag. Without this loyalty 
we would not have been able to safeguard the backbone of the 
Fleet. I hope that our officers and warrant officers will 
preserve this loyalty tomorrow as well. I wish you this 
specifically.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain 2nd Rank Nikolay Litkovets: "Fleet in </F>
Financial Squeeze"] 
  [Text] After failing to pay off the Pacific Fleet last 
year, the government continues to "experiment" this year as 
well. In January the financial requirements of the Fleet were 
met only to the level of 25.3 percent, in February only by 36.5 
percent, and at the end of March, only by 18 percent. 
  As was noted by the Chief of the Financial and Economic 
Directorate of the Pacific Fleet, Colonel N. Sheremetyev, the 
Fleet cannot even pay for bread for the table of 
compulsory-service seamen, not to mention paying plants for ship 
repairs. In the near future complete disconnection of naval 
forces from energy supplies is expected.

<F P=106> [Article from Vybir Independent Information Agency special </F>
for NARODNA ARMIYA: "A Non-Nuclear Ukraine. Too Cheaply?"] 
  [Text] Should Ukraine be a non-nuclear state? That is 
the general question that includes thousands of other questions 
that have been officially resolved today. One step in that 
direction was the signing of the trilateral agreement in Moscow 
and the ratification of the START-1 treaty by the Ukrainian 
parliament. But it cannot be considered closed, not only because 
Ukraine has still not yet joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, but also because the official stance does not always 
coincide with the views of the leaders of the existing political 
forces. 
<H8>  The Right </H8>
  The head of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, 
Stepan Khmara, feels that the signing of the trilateral 
agreement is a violation of the Constitution and a political 
stunt. The stance of UNSO is based on the postulate that Ukraine 
should be a nuclear power, since it has an age-old enemy right 
next door. By turning over the nuclear weapons of the former 
Soviet Union, Ukraine should without doubt simultaneously think 
about creating "its own nuclear bomb" today. 
  The head of the KUN, Slava Stetsko, had a negative opinion 
of 
the signing of the "trilateral agreement": "...KUN feels that 
this statement could not be signed, since after all it was not 
the only way out of the situation; quite a few influential 
politicians and commentators have stated that they understand 
why Ukraine is not rushing to disarm--it is afraid of Russia. 
The more so considering the recent evidence of aggressiveness... 
Russia is trying to return the former republics to its lap 
somehow, announcing its claims to the right to carry out 
`peacekeeping operations' on that terrain. They are maintaining 
their troops in the Central Asian republics and arranging 
provocations in the Caucasus and the Transcaucasus, as a result 
of which blood is being spilled. So returning to the problem of 
nuclear weapons, I would point out once again that the 
trilateral declaration is a mistake. We are not against 
disarmament in general. We are for a non-nuclear Ukraine. But in 
a non-nuclear world." 
  Unequivocal support for the idea of a strong nation state is 
characteristic of the representatives of the right wing; such a 
state is impossible today without nuclear weapons as a factor in 
restraining instability in its foreign-policy priorities with 
Russia, from their point of view. 
<H8>  National Democrats </H8>
  The convictions of some representatives of the 
national-democratic bloc are close to the positions of the 
right-wing parties. And although they advocate the idea of a 
non-nuclear Ukraine, they also would accept nuclear weapons as 
one of the determining factors in the security of the state and 
property, and which should be sold as dearly as possible. 
  Mykhaylo Horyn, the chairman of the Ukrainian Republican 
Party, feels that the trilateral agreement is an exceptionally 
important document that requires profound analysis, but "to 
accept it as is, as it is now, would signify a serious blow to 
Ukraine." 
  Rukh leadership member Ivan Zayets holds a similar 
viewpoint. 
He asserts that "there is no document today that discusses 
weapons, as well as strategic nuclear weapons, in full. We have 
no document of what the concrete guarantees of the national 
security of Ukraine will be. We have no document today that 
revokes the territorial claims of Russia against Ukraine." Ivan 
Zayets feels that as a consequence of the incarnation of this 
document, Ukraine will be destroying not only the nuclear 
warheads, but will also have to destroy the entire 
infrastructure--the aircraft, the ships, the missiles, the silos. 
  Larysa Skoryk expresses complete support and understanding 
of 
the actions of the president. She considers the transfer of the 
nuclear weapons to Russia the first step toward getting out of 
the economic crisis that Ukraine is experiencing today. "The 
resolution of the nuclear problem, this hopeless nuclear 
`kindling' that lies on our territory and which an outside hand 
could always ignite, from which we have gotten nothing but worry 
and a negative attitude toward ourselves, would open up a new 
way for Ukraine to receive urgent credits, of which, I am 
convinced, the very first portion should go to resolving the 
issues of food and power resources." 
<H8>  The Centrists </H8>
  The political parties on this portion of the spectrum have 
indicated clearly that Ukraine should be a non-nuclear state, 
and should accept nuclear disarmament as a contract from which 
the greatest profit should be obtained. Leonid Kuchma, who today 
holds a position close to that of the PDVU, for example, sees 
this contract as unsuccessful: "They already have us wrapped 
around their finger, whatever may be said now." 
  Volodymyr Filenko, the leader of the Party for the 
Democratic 
Resurrection of Ukraine [PDVU], says that "the trilateral 
agreement pertaining to START-1 signed in Moscow could be 
considered positive as a whole, but the details could be 
disputed: How much of a security guarantee there is, whether the 
nuclear fuel be returned to Ukraine, and guarantees of 
compensation to Ukraine." 
  "One of the basic program principles of the Green Party is 
to 
fight for a non-nuclear Ukraine. We are succeeding in this, but 
there are certain reservations. While entirely supporting 
nuclear disarmament, for example, we have reservations that in 
the case of our use of nuclear fuel, we will once again be 
energy-dependent. Because the nuclear fuel will be processed 
abroad, and we will have to buy it...," says Volodymyr Kononov, 
the head of the Green Party of Ukraine. 
  The social democrats hold a similar, clear-cut position. 
Yuriy Zbitnev, the head of the Social-Democratic Party of 
Ukraine: "Ukraine should, of course, be a non-nuclear state in 
the process that has started today as a whole." But in 
evaluating the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, he 
said pointed out that "in any case the signing of the agreement 
on nuclear disarmament will be an extraordinarily great step for 
Ukraine. The evaluation of that step should come in the next two 
or three years. The compensation will provide us with electric 
power, power resources and the possibility of creating a 
stabilization fund for the hryvnya. If the agreement really does 
provide an impetus for the world disarmament process, then it 
will be a substantial result. But if this process puts us once 
again on our knees before neighboring states and threatens the 
security of Ukraine with regard to the Near East, where the 
processes of nuclear disarmament are still only being planned 
(and it is doubtful that they will be developed in the near 
future), then the evaluation will of course be quite different." 
<H8>  The Left </H8>
  Sympathy with the idea of the nuclear status of Ukraine is 
felt to be lost among the socialist camp. This question is being 
considered within the context of a system of collective 
security, which cannot be created today without tensions in 
mutual relations with Russia. Oleksandr Moroz, the head of the 
Socialist Party of Ukraine: "We have taken on the resolution of 
a great many issues that have not permitted us to be occupied 
with the economy or strengthening the independence of our 
nation. National security is not guaranteed anywhere in the 
world through one's own forces alone. The mechanism of 
collective security operates all the time to this or that 
extent. We, in our jingoistic patriotism and ignorance, have 
rejected that. What has the state gained in that regard? 
Nothing. We have only lost the status of a nuclear power, a high 
technical level of production, and scientific and technical 
potential." 
  It is obvious from all of the aforementioned that the 
leaders 
of the leading political forces, independently of their 
positions with regard to the nuclear status of Ukraine, for the 
most part do not accept the form in which the withdrawal of 
nuclear missiles from the territory of Ukraine has been 
proposed. Most of them approve of the idea that this step was a 
mistake in the foreign policy of Ukraine. It is becoming more 
and more comprehensible that the question of nuclear status has 
no easy solution.

<F P=106> [Press Center of the Naval Forces of Ukraine: "The Command </F>
of the Black Sea Fleet Is Violating Existing Agreements"] 
  [Text] In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Vice 
Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, chief of staff and first deputy 
commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine [Viyskovo-Morski Syly 
Ukrayiny], stated that the command of the Black Sea Fleet, which 
de jure remains subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and 
Russia, has lately committed a series of violations of existing 
agreements with respect to the Fleet. He reported that in fact 
the Black Sea Fleet command does its best to ignore the 
Ukrainian side and is directly subordinated to the command of 
the Navy of the Russian Federation. The recent unannounced 
training exercises conducted by a large group of ships of the 
Black Sea Fleet, which were not approved by the appropriate 
structures, serve as further evidence of this. Temporary 
regulations of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are 
being introduced in the formations [zyednannya] and units of the 
Fleet. An earnest effort is under way to educate Black Sea Fleet 
personnel exclusively in the traditions of the Russian Army and 
Navy, despite the fact that more than 50 percent of the men 
serving in the Fleet are conscripts from Ukraine. 
  This is particularly evident in the case of the naval 
infantry brigade of the Black Sea Fleet. In violation of the 
existing agreement regarding manning the Fleet with equal 
numbers of conscripts from Ukraine and Russia, brigade personnel 
who have been discharged into the reserves are being replaced 
exclusively by conscripts from the Russian Federation. The men 
in this formation are being told that they are serving in a 
naval infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Russia. This is 
eloquently confirmed by the fact that the members of the brigade 
wear Russian insignia on their uniforms, that the St. Andrew's 
flag flies over the staff headquarters, and by certain other 
facts. In addition, there has recently been a marked increase in 
office facilities and equipment [orhtekhnika] provided for the 
subunits of this formation, and the number of personnel in the 
brigade has more than doubled. 
  It is Oleksiy Ryzhenko's view that in order to prevent a 
rise 
in tensions in the Crimean region, the commander of the Black 
Sea Fleet must do everything in his power to ensure that no 
actions are taken in violation of existing agreements and the 
principles of equality and brotherhood established in the 
relations between the people of Ukraine and Russia and the Armed 
Forces of our two states.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleh Makhno: "Why Is Meshkov Violating the Laws </F>
of Ukraine?"] 
  [Text] One of the characteristic features of 
our life is that the more our "power wielders" talk of a civil 
society, the more they are apt to violate the law. Now we have 
the president of the Republic of Crimea engaging in the same 
conduct -- his preelection promises notwithstanding, he is 
disregarding the Ukrainian Constitution. Thus, following a rainy 
Thursday, having set his Komandirskiye wristwatch by the tolling 
of the Kremlin bells, he issued another of his directives to the 
Crimean [military] commissariats regarding the next call-up of 
young Crimeans to military service with the instruction that 
they should serve only on the Crimean peninsula. Not a foot, 
booted or bare, is to step beyond the isthmus! 
  "This directive is illegal. There is no foundation for it 
whatsoever," said Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan, Ukraine's deputy 
minister of defense, at a press conference held upon his return 
from Crimea at the end of last week. "The military leadership (I 
have in mind the military commissar of Crimea, Major-General 
Volkov, and the commander of the army corps, Major-General 
Kuzmuk) also know this and will carry out the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry's orders to act in accordance with acting legislation. 
In other words, the conscription of youths will be conducted 
according to the extraterritorial principle." 
  To be sure, this does not mean that all Crimeans will serve 
exclusively outside the territory of the Crimean Republic, added 
Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan. There are a number of preferences [pilhy] 
under which a certain category of conscripts will be allowed, as 
before, to undergo their military training not far from home. 
These preferences are well-known, and they are taken into 
account by every military commissariat in Ukraine. But the total 
number of such youths will not exceed 20 percent. 
  If only matters were confined to this attempt by Meshkov to 
place the Crimean commissariat system under his jurisdiction. 
But the "campaign" is much broader in scale. Meshkov's cabinet 
has issued several other "military" directives that clearly 
exceed this body's authority. For example, the directive to 
submit full information on the deployment of the units and 
subunits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on their structure, 
military objectives, etc. That is how the authorities in Crimea 
want to let us know that they would like to form their own armed 
forces... 
  It is unlikely that the Crimean president and his military 
advisors expect to receive this information. Nor do they have 
any need of it at present. In I. Bizhan's view, the main 
objective is to raise a political outcry and create tension 
surrounding these issues (and that of conscription, in 
particular). 
  In all likelihood, Meshkov's team has not yet gotten over 
its 
recent presidential election campaign and is confusing it with 
the realities of the present. And this is no longer funny. It is 
one thing to make the Crimeans sit down an hour earlier to their 
dinner tables and quite another to put young conscripts in the 
dock for failing to carry out the Law on Military Duty and 
Military Service (and this outcome is not out of the question 
should the conscripts and their relatives heed the calls to 
unlawful actions). That is why Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan asked the 
members of the mass media to report this event accurately and 
explain to the public the position of the Ministry of Defense of 
Ukraine. Certain advisors to the president of the Crimean 
Republic are very active. We have in mind the specialists on 
military affairs who until recently wore military uniforms and 
still cannot reconcile themselves to their new status of 
reservists. Thus, one of them suddenly decides to "correct the 
actions" of the military subunits and units of the Armed Forces 
of Ukraine, while another decides to conduct "authorized" 
inspections. One cannot help but be reminded of old circus nags 
that start to dance out of habit as soon as they hear any kind 
of music. It should be noted that, as a rule, these reservists' 
nostalgic charges are seen as poor jokes -- the kind that one is 
embarrased to laugh at and ashamed to tolerate. But if the 
supporters of the Crimean president want to question the 
competence of the military leadership of the army corps, they 
have absolutely no grounds for this. 
  "I myself head the certification commission," said Col-Gen 
Ivan Bizhan, "and I have complete confidence in the professional 
qualifications of the officers and generals serving in the units 
stationed on the Crimean peninsula." 
  During his visit to Crimea, Maj-Gen Ivan Bizhan also met 
with 
Admiral Selivanov, the chief of the Main Staff of the Navy of 
the Russian Federation. Their talks centered on a number of 
fundamental issues regarding the Black Sea Fleet. Among them -- 
the fact that the Russian side exceeds its authority in the 
command of the Fleet, the Russians' desire to unilaterally 
dispose of the Fleet's material assets, and their resistance to 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's demand for an immediate 
inventory of the Fleet's property as stipulated by the 
government agreements reached in Massandra and Yalta. 
Unfortunately, the Russian side has once again attempted to pass 
over these questions and has failed to answer why only citizens 
of the Russian Federation are being recruited to the elite unit 
of naval infantry contrary to the "50-50" provision called for 
by the agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Rear Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, chief of staff </F>
and first deputy commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine, under 
the rubric "From the Standpoint of a Professional"; "The Black 
Sea Fleet: Myth and Reality"] 
  [Text] The notion that Ukraine does not need to create its 
own Naval Forces and that the Black Sea Fleet is one and 
indivisible and fully capable of defending the interests of both 
Ukraine and Russia on the southern maritime border is currently 
being promoted with increasing persistence in the mass media and 
in statements by Russian political leaders at various levels and 
by high-ranking officials of the Navy of the Russian Federation 
and the Black Sea Fleet. Without entering upon a discussion of 
the political reasons behind these statements and the reasons 
why the interests of Ukraine have become so dear to the Black 
Sea Fleet, I would like to express my views from a professional 
standpoint regarding the military potential of today's Black Sea 
Fleet and its present condition. 
  An objective analysis shows that today this Fleet is not 
capable of successfully performing its tasks. The claims about 
its high level of combat readiness are pure myth that belie the 
real state of affairs. Numerous facts attest to this. The Black 
Sea Fleet is equipped with obsolete models of missile weaponry 
of the former USSR, some of which are no longer produced by 
industry. For the past seven to ten years, no regular 
maintenance [planovi remonty] has been performed on the 
missile/artillery weaponry [raketno-artyleriyska zbroya], and 
only breakdown repairs [avariyno-vidnovchi remonty] are being 
carried out. Considering that the average age of the ships is 15 
to 20 years and that lately no funds have been spent on their 
maintenance, it is obvious even to a nonspecialist that the 
Fleet will die of its own accord by the year 2000 because it 
will be morally obsolete [moralno zastarilyy], as well as 
because of its technical condition. Given their service life and 
technical condition, it makes no sense to modernize and 
refurbish these ships. The intensity and quality of ensuring 
their combat readiness has dropped for many reasons. One-time 
sorties by a group of 20-25 ships are hardly proof of the 
Fleet's might and combat readiness. Hence, it is a myth to 
describe this Fleet as a guarantor of the CIS. 
  For several years now, no new surface or underwater ships 
and 
no auxiliary vessels have been added to the Black Sea Fleet. The 
majority of the combatant ships need both minor and capital 
repairs. 
  Currently, 20 combatant ships of the Black Sea Fleet, five 
submarines, 20 auxiliary vessels, and five special-purpose 
vessels are undergoing repairs at Ukrainian ship repair 
facilities. Plans calls for sending another 77 ships and vessels 
for repairs. 
  As we know, even the shortest halt in the development of 
military equipment is intolerable, because it becomes both 
morally and physically obsolete very rapidly. Thus, if the ships 
of the Black Sea Fleet are not being equipped with the latest 
equipment today, one can hardly speak with any credibility about 
their high level of combat readiness. 
  Take, for example, one of the mine-sweeping elements 
[divizion tralshchykiv] of the 68th brigade of the Sea Area 
Defense Force [OVR]. Half the mine-sweepers in this element were 
put into service before 1975, or almost 20 years ago. Their 
twenty-year-old sweeping and other equipment is hardly likely to 
be suited to sweeping for today's mines. 
  The situation in other subunits, units, and formations of 
surface ships is similar. Nor is the combat readiness of the 
Black Sea Fleet's submarines up to the necessary level. There 
are plans to write some of them off as unsuited for further 
military service. Some have been unable to sail for a year 
because of damage to some material part, because their storage 
batteries have run down, etc. For example, the storage batteries 
in all the submarines in one formation have been fully depleted 
or are nearing depletion, and the submarines have been off 
combat-ready status since February of this year. The command of 
the Black Sea Fleet is planning to remove them from active 
service in the combat-ready forces and mothball them. 
  One hundred percent of the aircraft fleet of the Black Sea 
Fleet needs to be renewed. Due to a lack of fuel and lubricants 
[PMM] and spare parts, there are almost no training flights for 
aviation personnel. Under such circumstances, the skills and 
expertise of flight personnel grow rusty. 
  The hydrographic department of the Black Sea Fleet is not 
performing its full range of duties from Izmayil to the village 
of Chornomorske and in the vicinity of Yalta because there are 
no funds to pay rent for this territory. The Black Sea Fleet is 
in a difficult financial situation. 
  There are extremely serious problems in the staffing of the 
Fleet's subunits, ships, and units with command cadres. For 
example, only one-third of the ships in the mine-sweeping 
element [divizion morskykh tralshchykiv], of which we spoke 
earlier, have Combat Section-1 [BCh-1] and Combat Section 2-3 
[BCh2-3] staff commanders. Only 60 percent of the slots for 
warrant officers [michmany] and 50 percent of those for petty 
officers [starshyny] are filled. Every second ship lacks such 
leading specialists as sonar operators [akusty] and radiometric 
operators [radiometrysty]. When making sorties for military 
training exercises, ships are forced to "borrow" sailors, petty 
officers, warrant officers, and officers from the ships 
remaining in port. 
  A similar situation exists in many other subunits. At 
present, 20 percent of all junior officer slots are unfilled. 
Graduates of Russian military schools are unwilling to serve in 
the Black Sea Fleet because of the unstable situation. 
  The command of the Black Sea Fleet is forced to reorganize 
the Fleet. This reorganization anticipates retiring a number of 
obsolete and unsailable [nekhodovi] ships and transferring their 
specialists into the crews of operating ships. Certain subunits 
and units of the Black Sea Fleet are being reorganized, and 
ships and vessels are being removed from active service and 
mothballed. 
  For example, in September of last year, a separate 
helicopter 
regiment was disbanded in one of the garrisons. A radiotechnical 
observation platoon [radiotekhnichnyy vzvod sposterezhennya] was 
disbanded at one of the bases, which had a sharply negative 
impact on navigation in this region of the Black Seal. The 
construction of a secure command post [zakhyshchenoho komandnoho 
punktu] of the staff of the Black Sea Fleet has been frozen. The 
expensive equipment that had already been installed there is 
being stolen. 
  The incidence of theft and squandering of equipment and 
other 
property is very high in the Black Sea Fleet. The number of such 
incidents is rising in spite of the fact that criminal charges 
have been lodged in some instances. As, for example, in 
connection with the disapperance in one of the units of 44 
silver-zinc batteries valued at many millions of rubles. 
  The number of ships, vessels, and military equipment that is 
being written off, as it were, is also very large. All this is 
being done unilaterally, without the approval of the Ukrainian 
side, even though, as has already been stressed, the Black Sea 
Fleet in this transitional stage belongs to Russia and Ukraine 
in equal parts. Nevertheless, the fleet takes orders only from 
Moscow. Thus, the Commander in Chief of the Navy of the Russian 
Federation issued an order on 24 August 1993 instructing that 15 
combatant ships and vessels, including the SKR Krasnyy Krym 
[guided missile destroyer Kashin class DDG], several submarines, 
amphibious assault, and other ships be written off during 
1993-94. In the aviation units, aircraft equipment and motor 
vehicles [aviatsiyna i avtomobilna tekhnika] are being written 
off in bulk and by the piece, as they say. 
  The large-scale commercial activity on the Black Sea Fleet 
cannot help but be of great concern as well. This activity is 
also being carried on unilaterally, without the participation of 
the Ukrainian side and without handing over 50 percent of the 
earnings from the sale of this property to Ukraine as required 
by the existing agreements. The PSK Donbass [coastal rescue 
ship], the SRZK Ladoga and Kursk [AGI Mayak class] have already 
been sold to commercial structures at below-market prices, and 
the SRZK Ritsa [AGI Mayak class] has been handed over to the 
hydrographic department to be passed on to businessmen. The 
RS-239 and the PAS Kuban [personnel support ship] have been 
given to Bulgaria purportedly in payment for repairs performed 
for the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The facts cited above are only the visible tip of the 
ruinous 
process of squandering and theft that is taking place in the 
Black Sea Fleet. Much of what is happening here is veiled in 
secrecy. And the commands of the Navy of the Russian Federation 
and of the Black Sea Fleet fiercely defend these secrets. What 
other explanation is there for the categorical rejection of the 
insistent and frequent demands of the Ukrainian side that a 
competent bilateral commission conduct an inventory of the Black 
Sea Fleet's assets and determine what it possessed on 6 December 
1991? 
  It is clear from the facts presented above, as well as many 
other facts known to us, that to speak of the Black Sea Fleet as 
a guarantor of Ukraine's security is, at best, irresponsible. 
The Crimea is an integral part of Ukraine, and the borders of 
Ukraine are protected by her Armed Forces, including those that 
are stationed in the autonomous republic. 
  The security of the people of Ukraine can be guaranteed only 
by her own Naval Forces. According to the document signed by the 
two presidents in Yalta, these Naval Forces, like the Navy of 
the Russian Federation, are to be created on the basis of the 
existing Black Sea Fleet. Only after this has been done will it 
be possible to consider unifying the command of the two fleets, 
which could ultimately guarantee the security of Ukraine and 
Crimea as well as the Russian Federation on the southern 
maritime perimeter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Oleksandr Kuzmuk, commander of </F>
the 32d Army Corps, by Major Vasyl Sadovskyy, under the rubric 
"First Interview in a New Post"; time and place not given: "`For 
Many, Crimea Is Associated with the Southern Seashore...'"] 
  [Text] Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Kuzmuk was appointed 
commander of the 32d Army Corps -- senior military commander in 
the Republic of Crimea -- at the end of last year by order of 
the Ministry of Defense. Our special correspondent in Simferopol 
met with the commander. 
  [Sadovskyy] Oleksandr Ivanovich, what is your kith and kin, 
as the saying goes? What road did you travel to reach your 
present post? 
  [Kuzmuk] I come from a military family. I was born in 1954 
in 
Baku. I am a Ukrainian. My biography is the usual biography of 
soldier. In 1975, I graduated from the Kharkiv Guards Higher 
Tank Command School [Kharkovskoye gvardeyskoye vyssheye 
tankovoye komandnoye uchilishche] and in 1983, from the Academy 
of Armored Troops [Akademiya bronetankovykh voysk]. I commanded 
a tank platoon, a company, a battalion, a separate tank 
regiment, a division. I served in the Group of Soviet Forces in 
Germany and in the Belarus, Moscow, Leningrad, Carpathian, and 
Odessa military districts. I am married and have two children. 
My son attends a medical institute, and my daughter is a 
schoolgirl. My wife is a homemaker. 
  [Sadovskyy] At one time, service on the sunny peninsula was 
considered a choice posting, for young lieutenant and 
gray-haired general alike. Suffice it to say that at the 
beginning of the seventies, your post was held by Dmitriy Yazov, 
the next to last minister of defense of the USSR. Those days 
have sunk into oblivion. Can it be said that only the chosen get 
posted to Crimea today? 
  [Kuzmuk] For many, Crimea is associated only with the 
Southern seashore. After coming here, I got to see the other 
side of Crimea. You see, the formations and units of the corps 
are stationed in difficult climatic and geographic conditions -- 
in alpine and steppe regions. From this standpoint, the sunny 
peninsula looks quite different. As far as the prestige of 
serving anywhere, including here, is concerned, my attitude is 
that a soldier's job is the same in any region -- wherever his 
Fatherland orders him to serve. 
  [Sadovskyy] The alpha and omega of the functioning of any 
army is its combat training. How is this reflected today in the 
life of the units and subunits of the army corps? 
  [Kuzmuk] I have been accustomed since my days as a 
lieutenant 
to resolve all matters connected with military discipline and 
everyday life through combat training. This is the foundation on 
which the military machine stands. If there is combat training, 
there will be enthusiasm among the officers and the opportunity 
to develop their abilities; personal interest in military 
service will also appear among the soldiers. Experience shows 
that when combat training is extensive and effective, all other 
problems such as infringements of regulations [neustavshchina] 
and desertion disappear. Speaking of the difficulties 
encountered today in organizing combat training, I would like to 
note that those commanders who regard combat training of 
paramount importance manage to find the necessary resources and 
time and utilize the optimum forms and methods. They conduct 
lessons and exercises and do so in a comprehensive and 
interesting manner. Such commanders include officers Botov and 
Makavchuk. This year the training process has been organized and 
is being conducted very intensively. We are devoting particular 
attention to coordination between subunits. 
  [Sadovskyy] There is currently a great deal of talk at 
various levels concerning the presence of units of the Armed 
Forces of Ukraine on the peninsula. Some are not averse to 
making political capital on this. What can you tell us on this 
score? 
  [Kuzmuk] Yes, there has been an onslaught from some parts of 
the mass media on our presence here, an onslaught that is purely 
opportunistic. Moreover, they make use of an expression that is 
new to us -- "demilitarization." Who has been militarizing the 
Crimea and when? Or the phrase "Ukrainian military formations." 
Matters concerning the performance of their duties by the 
formations and units of the Armed Forces in the Crimea lie 
within the jurisdiction of the commander-in-chief, the president 
of the country, and the minister of defense. And there are 
exactly as many troops here as are needed to defend Ukraine. 
  [Sadovskyy] All the same, by its very nature, this talk of 
"reductions" offends the military... 
  [Kuzmuk] The allegations of some politicians that the army 
is 
not combat ready, that the antiaircraft defense system is not in 
place, upset the officers who are laboring selflessly in this 
difficult field. I believe that this is simply a tactical move 
on the part of activists and politicians, who are trying to 
distract the Crimeans from solving urgent problems. And nothing 
more. You see, reasonable people are perfectly aware that the 
cause of Crimea's economic difficulties is by no means due to 
the presence of the troops. 
  [Sadovskyy] As we know, today anyone who feels like it dons 
the mantle of champion of the rights and interests of the people 
who wear shoulder boards. I would like to hear your opinion... 
  [Kuzmuk] Naturally, I am following the situation that is 
developing around us. It is characteristic that most candidates 
for the office of people's deputy broached military issues in 
their programs. These issues included the same notion of 
demilitarization I mentioned above (to be sure, now it has an 
ecological slant) and military service by Crimean youths to be 
performed only on the territory of the peninsula. Yet it is 
quite obvious that these points are purely populist in nature. 
The fact is that there are documents regarding how many people 
to recruit and which units -- of the Black Sea Fleet and of the 
land forces. Protocols have been signed on percentages. The 
majority of politicians are dilettantes in military matters. For 
example, what does it mean to insist that youths must serve in 
Crimea? Crimea has no training subunits and units. Consequently, 
the youths will learn neither a military nor a civilian 
specialization. They will not become signal men, nor radar 
specialists, nor operators. In short, they will work only at 
unskilled jobs in the army or be doomed to serving in minor 
posts. Neither their mothers, nor those who stand behind their 
backs, know this. And so, naturally, serving near your parents 
appears very appealing at first glance. Although, incidentally, 
statistics show that this kind of service -- and we have bitter 
experience -- has, as a rule, a negative effect. It means 
unauthorized leaving of units, absences without leave, and other 
violations. 
  [Sadovskyy] Do the Crimeans lead in this? 
  [Kuzmuk] Yes. 
  [Sadovskyy] Traditionally, the military maintained close 
contacts with local authorities, enterprises, and institutions. 
Naturally, it is no easy thing to become settled in one's new 
position in a few months' time. Nevertheless, Oleksandr 
Ivanovich, have you found there to be mutual understanding? 
  [Kuzmuk] It seems to me that the local authorities are more 
concerned with politics than with the practical things that need 
to be done. Many problems affecting everyday life have been set 
aside for the time being. As to establishing contacts, I have 
done so. For example, I have met privately with President Yuriy 
Meshkov of Crimea. I asked Yuriy Aleksandrovich to take a look 
with his own eyes at the situation and conditions of the Armed 
Forces of Ukraine that are billeted in Crimea, with the eyes of 
a president. I also offered that we solve social problems 
jointly. 
  [Sadovskyy] What was Yuriy Meshkov's reaction? 
  [Kuzmuk] I believe that Yuriy Aleksandrovich met what I said 
with understanding. 
  [Sadovskyy] And the last question: What worries you most as 
the senior military commander in the Republic of Crimea? 
  [Kuzmuk] The situation that has arisen on the peninsula. 
Nonetheless, this situation cannot affect the combat readiness 
and normal activity of the troops to any degree. It is soldier's 
duty to perform his main task -- to study and perfect his 
professional skills so that he can defend his people in the 
event of danger. No one has the right to interfere in our 
performance of this task. It is also essential to give the 
officers and warrant officers the opportunity to devote 
themselves fully to their duties without having to glance over 
their shoulders. We also need normal living conditions, normal 
conditions for our families, a comfortable life. Everything else 
will fall into place. We are fully aware of the hardships that 
the people are suffering. But we are not asking anything extra 
for ourselves. I would also want the Crimeans to view us not as 
some sort of monster but as people who are honestly trying to do 
their duty to their Fatherland. 
  [Sadovskyy] Thank you for this conversation.

<F P=106> [Article by Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, Commander </F>
of the Naval Forces of Ukraine: "The Way To Eliminate Tensions 
Is To Implement the Yalta Agreements"] 
  [Text] Lately, especially after the meeting of the 
presidents of Ukraine and Russia in Massandra, a concerted 
effort has been under way in the Russian mass media and in the 
Black Sea Fleet to inculcate the notion that this Fleet should 
now be regarded as belonging to Russia and that this issue has 
already been decided. There is also evidence of concrete steps 
being taken to make this so. Thus, Russian Army insignia have 
been issued to the members of some units of the Black Sea Fleet, 
such as, for example, the naval infantry brigade. This process 
is continuing: Military personnel serving in the Black Sea Fleet 
are being made to change into Russian uniforms. Not too long 
ago, Russia's St. Andrew's flag was raised on auxiliary vessels 
and some warships in Sevastopol. As a matter of fact, these 
flags have still not been lowered. This is a violation of 
Article 7 of the Yalta agreements, which stipulates that the 
naval insignia of the Black Sea Fleet is defined and approved 
jointly by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. 
  These and many other facts attest that the various conflicts 
and misunderstandings that emerge result primarily from 
violations of the Yalta agreements and an unwillingness to abide 
by these agreements. 
  Many officials of the Russian Federation and Crimea, as well 
as the Ministry of Defense and the Naval Forces, tend to view 
the protocol of intent, signed by President Leonid Kravchuk of 
Ukraine and President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation in 
Massandra, as an agreement that is now void, and they insist 
that all problems be settled solely on the basis of the 
Massandra documents. 
  As we know, these documents stated that the Ukrainian side 
was prepared to consider the Russian Federation's proposals that 
Ukraine hand over her portion of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia 
as payment of Ukraine's debt for energy supplies. To consider 
the possibility, but not to hand over her portion of the Fleet. 
As to the handing over of the infrastructure, this was out of 
the question from the beginning -- this territory belongs to 
Ukraine and it will not be handed over. The specific mechanisms 
of compensation for that part of the Fleet that was to be handed 
over and the question of Russia's use of naval bases on the 
territory of Ukraine were to be decided in the course of future 
negotiations on the basis of recommendations submitted by 
commissions of experts from both sides. But this question 
remained unresolved because no mutually acceptable solution was 
found. We, therefore, return to our earlier positions. 
  Referring to this problem, Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko in a recent interview with 
Interfax-Ukraine stated that future talks on the 
Black Sea Fleet should be based primarily on the Yalta 
agreements of 3 August 1992. 
  According to these agreements, the Black Sea Fleet is to 
serve as a basis for the creation of the Russian Navy and the 
Naval Forces of Ukraine. While these are being created, the 
Fleet remains under the joint command of the presidents of both 
countries. Thus, during this transitional period, that is until 
its status is finally decided at the highest state level, this 
Fleet belongs to both states. Ukraine and Russia have equal 
rights to the Fleet. The Fleet is bound to defend the interests 
of both states to an equal degree. One might have thought that 
the Black Sea Fleet would serve as the basis on which the two 
sides would achieve mutual understanding and draw closer 
together. 
  It is the duty of the command of the Black Sea Fleet and all 
its command structures to educate its military personnel and its 
blue- and white-collar workers in a spirit of love and respect 
for Russia and Ukraine in equal measure and to foster the same 
attitude towards both. It needs to do everything in its power to 
ensure that every sailor, sergeant, petty officer [starshyna] 
warrant officer [michman i praporshchyk], officer, and admiral, 
every blue- and white-collar worker, is deeply aware that he may 
not and has neither the legal nor the moral right to disregard 
the interests of either side by his actions and his conduct, 
because for the time being he serves both sides. That is why it 
is sad, to say the least, to hear a high-ranking commander, who 
should set an example of this attitude, making statements that 
"the fleet of Ukraine is the fleet of a foreign state." It 
should have long since been clear that, whatever the ultimate 
future of the Black Sea Fleet might be, under no circumstances 
should attitudes that are negative towards Ukraine in even the 
slightest degree be encouraged in this Fleet. This is the 
country where this Fleet is based, and the Fleet should comply 
unconditionally with this country's laws, both during this 
transitional period and in the future. 
  That is how it should be. This is in the spirit of the Yalta 
agreements. And if everyone in the Black Sea Fleet understood 
this problem thus, there would be no situations that lead to 
conflicts. 
  In practice, things are quite different. We know that all 
agreements reached with respect to the Black Sea Fleet, 
beginning with the agreement in Dagomys on 23 June 1992, do not 
nullify but rather supplement one another in defining the legal 
mechanism for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet. From the 
beginning, taking into account Russia's interests on the Black 
Sea, Ukraine has been meticulously fulfilling the obligations 
she assumed. 
  However, immediately following the meeting of the two 
presidents in Dagomys, there began an attempt to artifically 
exacerbate the problems of the Fleet. First, they declared the 
Black Sea Fleet to be the fleet of all the CIS members, charged 
with the "defense of the southern borders of the Slavic states." 
Then, rejecting all military theoretical concepts, they declared 
it to be a strategic fleet, yet forgetting to identify what and 
whose strategy they had in mind. When it proved impossible to 
sustain this myth, they began to plant the notion in people's 
minds through the mass media that the Fleet belonged exclusively 
to Russia. Moreover, this unwholesome propaganda uproar is 
supported by raising the Russian flag, adopting Russian 
insignia, etc. 
  As a member of the military, it is difficult for me to 
believe that the Black Sea Fleet command cannot put an end to 
these excesses. This looks more like an unwillingness to bring 
order to the situation or a deliberately planned action. The 
position of the Black Sea Fleet command is further attested by 
the fact that it does not regard the laws of Ukraine and the 
orders and directives of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine as 
documents that must be obeyed, while the orders of the Ministry 
of Defense of the Russian Federation and of the 
Commander-in-Chief of the Navy of the Russian Federation are 
carried out unconditionally and fully. The fact that it is 
subordinated solely to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia and 
not to the ministries of defense of the two countries is cited 
by the command of the Black Sea Fleet only when it is refusing 
to carry out some request made by the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Defense. 
  Recently, the level of combat readiness of the units and 
formations of the Black Sea Fleet has been unilaterally raised 
without informing the Ukrainian side. The Fleet is perfecting 
amphibious assault operations [vidpratsyovuyutsya desantni 
operatsiyi], dozens of ships are being put out to sea, and some 
are even being sent to the shores of other states. These 
large-scale operations are being conducted on Ukrainian 
territory and on Ukrainian bases without any kind of 
coordination with Ukraine. 
  The level of these activities increased markedly during the 
presidential election in Crimea. This was anything but "innocent 
military training," as the Black Sea Fleet tried to represent; 
this was a purposeful and planned action. Especially, inasmuch 
as it was accompanied by a build-up of social tensions with the 
help of the mass media. 
  Strange as it may seem, the Black Sea Fleet conducted itself 
in this situation as if these events were not developing and 
taking place on the erritory, bases, and in the waters of 
sovereign Ukraine. It is difficult to imagine the naval forces 
of any country, based on the territory of another state, 
behaving in such fashion with complete disregard for the laws 
and interests of the host country. There is no precedent for 
such conduct anywhere else in the world. If the Black Sea Fleet 
acknowledges that it is an operational formation [operatyvne 
formuvannya] of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, it is 
completely incomprehensible why such measures are conducted 
without the knowledge and approval of the Ukrainian side. And it 
is even more incomprehensible why the Black Sea Fleet's 
operations plan is approved in Moscow rather than in both 
capitals. 
  Nor can I ignore the following problem. Various mass media 
are spreading false information that Ukraine is violating the 
agreements on financing the Black Sea Fleet. Publishing data 
from the last few months, when Russia's share has indeed been 
larger than Ukraine's, the authors of these reports and 
broadcasts deliberately keep silent about the fact that Ukraine 
financed the Black Sea Fleet one hundred percent through all of 
1992 and up to May 1993, and that Russia has not settled its 
accounts with Ukraine to this day. Ukraine also pays the 
pensions and provides various social benefits to the military 
personnel of the Black Sea Fleet. Another fact that has received 
no publicity is that the Russian side is violating the 
agreements by financing the Black Sea Fleet through its own 
commercial structures rather than through the National Bank of 
Ukraine. That is the reason for the irregularities and delays in 
issuing payments. This attitude towards people is totally 
unjustified. As before, the legitimate desire of many servicemen 
in the Black Sea Fleet to take the loyalty oath to the people of 
Ukraine, in other words, one of the states to whom the Black Sea 
Fleet belongs and on whose territory it is based, the home of 
its sailors and their families, is perceived as a hostile act. 
There ave been instances, by no means isolated, in which such 
officers and warrant officers [michmany i praporshchyky] were 
dismissed from their posts by order, kicked out by the naval 
infantry [vykydaly za porih sylamy morskoyi pikhoty], and even 
discharged into the reserves, declared oath breakers, and so on. 
Such actions are confirmed by the most recent instance, in which 
the military personnel at the hospital base in Mykolayiv, who 
had taken a loyalty oath to the people of Ukraine, were 
dismissed on the spot from their jobs. Justice was done, 
however, and these servicemen received protection and were 
declared to be part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Yet Article 
7 of the signed protocol, which regulates the procedure for 
transferring (assigning) military personnel from one country's 
armed forces to the forces of another state, stipulates that the 
parties to the agreement will not hinder the transfer of 
officers and warrant officers. The Yalta and other agreements 
provide for mutual obligations on the part of Russia and Ukraine 
to protect all the rights of servicemen in this respect and 
allow them complete freedom of choice. 
  We witnessed a series of other serious situations that 
disturbed not only members of the military but also the 
residents of the city. These occurred when housing was being 
divided between the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of 
Ukraine, when the question of supplying heat to the village of 
Holandiya was being decided, when there were unsanctioned 
flights by airplanes of the Black Sea Fleet in violation of 
existing regulations, and when our fuel was seized from the fuel 
storage base in Sevastopol. It is no secret that the personnel 
of the Black Sea Fleet take part in various political actions, 
thereby violating the laws of both Ukraine and Russia. 
Currently, this type of activity is very much on the rise. 
  Lately, the Black Sea Fleet command has taken discriminatory 
steps in providing medical care for the personnel of the Armed 
Forces of Ukraine, including Ukraine's Naval Forces. 
  How do we propose to solve this situation, first and 
foremost 
with respect to Sevastopol? 
  We believe that the structure of the military command in 
Sevastopol should be changed immediately so that the garrison 
chief is appointed directly by the president of Ukraine. This 
should be an admiral or a general, who would take his orders 
solely from the president of Ukraine and who would be a member 
of the city's military commission and collegium. The 
commandants' offices [komendatury], hospital, polyclinics, all 
building and maintenance services, the military trade facility 
[voyentorh], and the sports and cultural institutions of the 
Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine should be placed 
under his command. 
  The services under his command should serve all the military 
units in Sevastopol but be independent of both the Black Sea 
Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine. The garrison chief should 
be in charge of the subunit, the regime service [sluzhba 
rezhymu], and other garrison facilities. Working closely with 
the administration of internal affairs and the Security Service 
of Ukraine, he and the structures placed under his command would 
then be able to safeguard genuine order in the city and prevent 
any conflicts. 
  The problems associated with basing ships in Sevastopol are 
also extremely important. In order to solve all the problems 
presented by relations between the two military entities, a 
structure needs to be created that would be independent of both 
the Black Sea Fleet and the Naval Forces of Ukraine -- the 
Sevastopol Naval Base [SVMB]. On the basis of an agreement, the 
SVMB could provide basing in Sevastopol for both the Russian and 
Ukrainian fleets, and, if necessary, also the fleets of other 
CIS members. It would be the task of the SVMB to provide all the 
necessary facilities for basing. In our view, this solution 
would remove the tension between Russia and Ukraine regarding 
Sevastopol and the basing of their fleets. 
  The Black Sea Fleet is a structure of the former USSR. 
Article 1 of the Yalta agreement states that it is to be divided 
between Russia and Ukraine so that it can serve as a basis on 
which the Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Navy of the Russian 
Federation will be created on the Black Sea. 
  In order to establish the Naval Forces of Ukraine, we need 
bases and funds for both general and specific -- i.e. fleet -- 
purposes. This is why it is very important to abide 
unconditionally by the joint agreement between the Russian 
Federation and Ukraine on acknowledging and regulating property 
relations by both sides. The agreement stipulates that all 
property of the Black Sea Fleet and its bases, both real and 
movable, is to be used in equal parts (50-50) by both states, 
Ukraine and Russia. 
  There is currently a process under way to downsize the Black 
Sea Fleet, and as part of this process, various materal assets 
are being leased to commercial structures and private 
individuals. The sale of the transport ship Donbass serves as an 
excellent example of what is happening. The vessel was sold at 
one-tenth of its real value. The agreement does not permit such 
actions without the approval of Ukraine's state structures and 
her Naval Forces. But this approval is not sought, which results 
in serious losses to Ukraine and her Naval Forces. 
  This unsupervised process of squandering the material assets 
of the Black Sea Fleet has been going on for more than two 
years. This is confirmed by the large number of criminal cases 
that have been brought. That is why today the question of 
dividing up the Black Sea Fleet cannot be dealt with without a 
special preliminary investigation and the necessary 
preparations. A commission must be formed to determine what 
assets the Black Sea Fleet had on 6 December 1991, that is, up 
to the date of the proclamation of sovereignty by Ukraine, and 
what has happened to these assets since then. The Russian and 
Ukrainian people should be told the whole truth about the losses 
they have suffered. 
  The second stage in the implementation of the Yalta 
agreements on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet should consist of 
removing those ships and armaments from combatant service that 
have completed their service life and putting them up for sale. 
Only those armaments should be retained that are needed in the 
new circumstances and that are capable of ensuring that the two 
fleets are able to carry out their assigned missions. 
  As part of the third and final stage, it is necessary to 
divide up what remains, but taking into account the portion that 
was sold or removed from Ukraine. 
  Throughout the entire transitional period, that is, until 
the 
end of 1995, Sevastopol must remain the main base of both the 
Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian 
Federation until Russia solves the problem of creating a base on 
its own territory. 
  In conclusion, I would like to encourage those who persist 
in 
driving a wedge between Ukraine and the Russian Federation to 
reread again and again the Yalta and other agreements on the 
Black Sea Fleet that were reached at the highest interstate 
level. All these agreements are imbued with a spirit of 
friendship and mutual respect between the two states and a 
desire to maintain equal relations between them, founded on the 
norms and principles of international law. 
  This example is worthy of emulation. Common sense tells us 
that this is the only viable approach. This approach also 
reflects the fraternal spirit and good-neighbor relations which 
the two people have always maintained. Unquestionably, the 
implementation of the Yalta agreements will continue to promote 
this relationship. 
  The future lies in just such relations, no matter what kind 
of misunderstandings we are currently experiencing. Those who 
stand in the way of the development and firm establishment of 
such relations are doing serious harm to both Russia and 
Ukraine. And it is difficult to say whom they are harming more. 
Those who sow the seeds of enmity and distrust between people 
will never grow and reap a good harvest. For there to be 
understanding between people, there must be a desire for such 
understanding.

<F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Zhurets, under the rubric "A Sociological </F>
View": "Chaplains on Active Military Service?.."] 
  [Text] Young people's attitudes to religion have 
recently become a topical issue not only in society in general, 
but also in the Armed Forces. Consequently, the question has 
arisen of creating the institution of military chaplains in the 
army. But is there a real need and foundation for this? 
  The results of a sociological survey conducted by the 
Institute of Sociology of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine 
show that the high potential of religion in the army is cited 
primarily by the clergy themselves. Ninety percent of the 
clergymen surveyed are in favor of creating the institution of 
chaplain in the Armed Forces, and 99 percent of representatives 
of all faiths are ready to begin this work now. 
  The military, however, takes a more cautious view of this 
prospect: 25 percent of the officers polled think that the 
prospects for the institution of chaplains in the army are not 
significant, 18 percent of the respondents believe that the role 
of religion in the education of youth should be increased in 
schools rather than in the army. Nevertheless, nearly one-third 
of the officers taking part in the survey stressed the need for 
a greater role for religion in the military environment. 
  As to personal attitudes to religion among the military, the 
results of the study conducted in the Armed Forces by the 
Institute of Sociology show that 50 percent, or half, of the 
officers regard themselves as nonbelievers, 15 percent of the 
military respondents describe themselves as not religious, and 
35 percent are unable to give a firm answer. 
  In the case of soldiers and sergeants, it appears that among 
term servicemen, the level of religiosity decreases with time. 
Thus, 36 percent consider themselves to be religious at the 
beginning of their term of service, and only 30 percent still 
describe themselves as such at the time of discharge. The 
percentage of those surveyed who count themselves among 
nonbelievers increases accordingly: 19 percent at the beginning 
of their service and 27 percent of the soldiers and sergeants 
completing their terms. This drop is explained as due primarily 
to the absence of the institution of chaplain in the army. As a 
matter of fact, according to reports in the mass media, the 
Russian Army is planning to appoint one of the hierarchs of the 
Russian Orthodox Church as the chief chaplain of the army 
already this year. They are also going to establish a system of 
educational institutions to train military chaplains. 
  In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, despite the discussions that 
have been going on about this subject for the past two years, no 
steps have been taken to introduce the post of military chaplain 
in the army. It is difficult to say what is causing this delay. 
Perhaps the fact that the Ukrainian military has more urgent 
problems to solve at this time -- how to feed the troops or 
where to find the necessary funds. In this situation, God helps 
those who help themselves, as they say.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar, chief of the </F>
Main Directorate for Educational and Sociopsychological Work of 
the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine: "The Scientific Approaches 
in the Work of the Organs of Educational and Sociopsychological 
Work Aim at Increasing the State of Discipline of Military 
Personnel"] 
  [Text] The so-called "human factor" plays an important role 
in any form of activity. It is the positive development of this 
factor in conditions of military service that is the goal of the 
organs of Educational and Sociopsychological Work [VSPR]. The 
ultimate goal of these efforts is to improve the performance by 
the Armed Forces of their set tasks. The part played by the VSPR 
organs in attaining this end consists of applying measures of 
educational and sociopsychological influence to affect such a 
specific indicator as the moral-psychological state of personnel. 
  This indicator is characterized primarily by the fact that 
it 
is very sensitive to a large number of factors to which a member 
of the military is subject. Thus, it is an integrating factor in 
which numerous components are concentrated. These components 
involve satisfying various human needs, ranging from the 
biologically programmed need for security and the need to 
satisfy physiological needs to the highest spiritual needs. 
  Ultimately, it is this highest level that is decisive in 
evaluating an individual's moral-psychological state, but this 
can only be built if there exists a more earthly foundation for 
it. 
  Thus, considering the complexity of an individual's needs 
and 
that the degree to which each is satisfied in turn affects an 
individual's moral-psychological state, we need to speak of a 
very broad spectrum of directions in our work, all of them aimed 
in one way or another at ensuring a satisfactory 
moral-psychological state of our troops. We need to recognize 
that some of these directions lie beyond the scope of the 
jurisdiction of the VSPR organs. 
  But there exists a law that is of fundamental importance to 
us: Just as certain factors affect the moral-psychological state 
of the troops, this state itself affects the attitude of 
personnel to all sorts of factors -- living conditions, the 
level of danger to life, restrictions in the sphere of social 
intercourse, etc. The degree to which spiritual needs are 
developed and an adequate system for satisfying these needs can 
compensate even for very significant deprivations that are part 
and parcel of military-professional activity as a whole and 
engaging in combat [vedennya boyovykh diy] in particular. 
  In other words, a military collective, whose 
moral-psychological state is at a sufficiently high level, is 
capable of maintaining it at the proper level on its own. We 
need only professionally ensure this basic level of development. 
Once it is reached, universal laws of self-regulation of complex 
systems begin to operate. 
  Obviously, everything has its limits, and we should know 
what 
these limits are and take them into account in our work. 
  The above reflections may seem theoretical, but only at 
first 
glance. We are discussing a very concrete issue -- defining the 
sphere of our practical work and the fundamental methods we must 
use to accomplish this job. 
  In the most general sense, let us begin with the premise 
that 
the sphere of our work is to influence the moral-psychological 
state, and that the method by which we exert this influence is 
by directing sociopsychological processes. 
  The moral-psychological state is measured by many individual 
factors, which in their aggregate create a complex system. One 
such sociopsychological indicator is the state of discipline of 
personnel [dystsyplinovanist osobovoho skladu], by which we mean 
the readiness of each individual soldier and the military 
community as a whole to abide by the accepted standards of 
military service: Military regulations, orders of commanders and 
superiors, directions, instructions, etc. Such readiness needs 
to be formed on both the conscious and unconscious levels of 
each individual. This is achieved by combining educational, 
including ideological, work with sociopsychological influence 
into an interactive system. 
  Why do we need to speak of such a system? Because the state 
of discipline is founded on a very wide range of 
psychophysiological, psychological, and sociopsychological 
factors. Directly included in the sociopsychological factors are 
the specific qualities and characteristics of each individual -- 
his patriotism, convictions, devotion to his Fatherland, etc. 
The system of educational work is specifically designed to form 
these traits; this is the goal of professional sociologists 
[narodoznavtsi], the system of the humanitarian training of 
personnel, and the like. In other words, those who regard the 
sphere of sociopsychological factors to be the exclusive sphere 
of psychologists are very much mistaken. 
  Unfortunately, at this stage, our educational work is mostly 
confined to simple imparting of information, whereas it should 
carry some emotional content, draw the soldier into the deepest 
strata of his nation's historical memory and the worldview of 
his ancestors, base itself on subconscious national archetypes. 
Educational work will then produce significantly better results 
in increasing the state of discipline of military personnel. 
  When working to increase the state of discipline of military 
personnel, it is necessary to keep in mind that this feature is 
dynamic -- depending on various conditions, the level of 
discipline of each individual soldier can change significantly 
over a short period of time. In particular, the level of 
discipline can be easily affected by excessive organizational 
measures conducted by superiors, as well as many other things 
that can produce a sense of inner dissatisfaction with the 
situation in which a person finds himself in military service. 
This dissatisfaction can activate the corresponding 
psychological mechanisms, but it will require purely 
organizational rather than sociopsychological measures. 
  There is a direct link between the state of discipline of 
personnel as a sociopsychological indicator and the general 
level of military discipline. Increasing military discipline is 
the common goal of virtually all structures of military 
leadership; every official bears his own measure of 
responsibility for this discipline. But the foundation of 
military discipline in the Armed Forces is the state of 
discipline of personnel. 
  Can military discipline be maintained at a more or less 
satisfactory level if the state of discipline of personnel 
remains low? 
  I should note that that was exactly what we always tried to 
do by directing all our efforts at increasing military 
discipline not by forming a sociopsychological characteristic 
like a state of discipline in personnel, but by creating 
conditions in which an undisciplined soldier -- that is, one 
psychologically prepared to violate discipline -- would be 
compelled to abide by accepted standards because of increased 
supervision, increased exactingness, etc. 
  Let us be frank -- we are not satisfied with the quality of 
our contingent of conscripts. Every professional activity is 
based on the possession of certain individual psychological 
characteristics by the person performing the activity, and 
military service is no exception. There exists a so-called 
professional profile [profesiohrama] of a soldier, which defines 
the necessary individual psychological characteristics required 
for normal service. Those individual psychological 
characteristics that are associated with the state of discipline 
of a soldier are an essential component of the professional 
profile and must be studied by experts in the military 
commissariats in the process of conscription. 
  Thus, the sociopsychological study of a conscript's 
personality plays an important role in preventing violations of 
military discipline. This study anticipates an assessment of the 
candidate's moral qualities, the motives underlying his conduct 
and activity, his military professional orientation, the way he 
interacts and behaves in a group, and other individual 
psychological qualities. 
  The sociopsychological study of individual traits cannot 
rely 
solely on information obtained from tests; it must be based on 
an analysis of the formation and development of an individual. 
  By analyzing an individual's biography, the conditions in 
which he was reared and his personality developed, it is 
possible to obtain information about his professional interests, 
moral principles, character traits, distinguishing features of 
his emotional makeup, organizational skills, etc. 
  We take into account that the development of personality is 
affected by the composition of the family, the way in which 
family members interact, the family's social and living 
conditions, and the interests and paramount requirements of the 
family as a whole. 
  Viewing moral qualities as stable features of an 
individual's 
conscious mind, which are reflected to a certain degree in his 
character, during the process of professional selection, the 
social psychologist makes use of the entire arsenal of 
psychological methods and methodologies. Based on the results of 
this analysis, a conclusion is reached regarding the probability 
of the subject's success or failure to perform under the 
conditions involved in military service and steps to prevent 
possible deviations in conduct are recommended. 
  But what can we do in today's circumstances in the event 
that 
this prognosis is negative? After all, this individual will 
still end up in the Armed Forces. The present situation does not 
allow us to create a professional army, in which recruitment 
into the military would be conducted on a competitive basis. At 
present, we take everyone. As a result, we frequently encounter 
a situation in which we are forced -- metaphorically speaking -- 
to make a musician out of a deaf man. To continue the same 
metaphor, all that we can do under the circumstances is not 
entrust the "deaf man" with a "violin" but with something closer 
to a "drum." 
  If we attain our goal of increasing the state of discipline 
of personnel, will this mean an automatic increase in the level 
of military discipline in general? It should be clearly 
understood that although there is a direct link between the 
state of discipline of personnel and overall military 
discipline, the state of discipline of subordinates is not 
always enough to compensate for miscalculations in general 
organizational matters, problems in creating the necessary 
conditions, etc. 
  Another thing that educators must recognize is that although 
the state of discipline of personnel is a sociopsychological 
indicator, this indicator, like the level of military discipline 
in general, is also affected by factors other than 
sociopsychological ones. Therefore, the deputy commander in 
charge of educational and sociopsychological work cannot ignore 
the wide range of issues that in one way or another involve the 
interests and needs of the individual. This approach is also 
reflected in the Temporary Regulations of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine. 
  The practical methods used by the VSPR organs in the sphere 
that involves the needs and underlying motives of conduct of 
personnel can vary widely, depending on specific conditions and 
practical possibilities. The temporary failure to satisfy one 
need can be compensated by satisfying another need, which a 
military psychologist and educator can ensure in a timely 
fashion. The fact that there are certain restrictions in 
military life can be accepted more readily by personnel if the 
system of motives is influenced in a proper professional manner. 
In certain conditions, the professional responsibility of a VSPR 
official may require candidly telling a superior about the range 
of possibilities in educational work and sociopsychological 
measures. It is, after all, possible to create a situation in 
which a person will basically refuse to execute every single 
order unless hypnotized to do so. 
  The VSPR organs must anticipate the dynamics of the 
moral-psychological state of personnel under the influence of 
the system of dominant factors and respond in timely manner to 
potential problems. 
  Work that is oriented on a conceptual approach to increasing 
military discipline by VSPR organs through influencing the state 
of discipline of personnel must be based on a scientifically 
founded sociopsychological system as an adjunct of military 
service. Allow me to list the main requirements of such a system. 
  It should provide for unified algorithms of activity on the 
part of VSPR professionals, taking into account the specific 
features of the sociopsychological characteristics of soldiers 
at various stages in their service, the psychological laws of 
group dynamics in military subunits, the laws underlying the 
impact of factors characteristic of military service on the 
individual at various stages of military service, and the like. 
  The system of the sociopsychological adjunct of military 
service must resemble a production flow chart [tekhnichna karta] 
of the work of VSPR professionals, which takes into account the 
actual level of training of military specialists by providing 
several alternative methods of work. There should be a base 
variant, which could be introduced immediately at the level that 
we have today, as well as alternatives involving a higher level, 
which, in addition to the basic measures that use the popular 
methodologies "Prohnoz," KOS-KOR, sociometrics, and some others, 
would also provide for the use of a higher degree of 
psychological manipulation. 
  An understanding of all these elements focuses our attention 
on our scientific base. What kind of base do we have today? We 
do not have a single up-to-date textbook on psychology for the 
military that would meet world standards in this field. In fact, 
we have no Ukrainian handbooks at all. Almost nothing is being 
done to train our own scientific cadres for the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine in the fields of educational work and meeting the 
sociopsychological needs of personnel in the districts and 
branches of the Armed Forces. 
  Another problem that we encounter in introducing modern 
scientific approaches in the work of the VSPR organs is the need 
that they be based on what I would call an adequate level of 
civilization in both society at large and the military 
environment. Our sociopsychological measures must be based on a 
certain level of understanding on the part of all officials of 
the specific features of our professional activity and on a 
proper attitude towards this work, on a readiness to introduce 
modern social techniques and "sophisticated" methods of 
influencing the moral-psychological state of our troops. This 
requires that we provide proper training not only for our 
specialists, but also for our entire officer corps, starting 
from the time they are attending military educational 
institutions. 
  All this lies in the future. But it requires that we take 
certain practical steps immediately. We need to encourage the 
directors of the Scientific-Research and Methodological Center 
of the Main Directorate of Educational and Sociopsychological 
Work of the Ministry of Defense to devote very serious attention 
to this matter. I expect them to provide teaching manuals for 
the forces that have been prepared on a modern scientific level 
and a detailed sociopsychological system of support in military 
service, which we need to begin introducing in stages in the 
Armed Forces starting now. In addition, we are waiting for a 
prospective program [perspektyvna prohrama] developed jointly 
with the Defense Ministry's Main Directorate for Military 
Education for providing officers in command cadres with basic 
sociopsychological training. 
  Any assessment of the contribution of the VSPR organs to 
increasing military discipline must be based on an assessment of 
their actual contribution to raising the level of the state of 
personnel discipline -- i.e., what concrete steps were taken 
towards this end. But this general assessment needs to be made 
more specific. It is not enough to simply add up the number of 
measures that were applied in evaluating the activity of VSPR 
organs. We have something different in mind. 
  First, all measures used in educational work and 
sociopsychological support must be combined into an integrated 
system, in which everything is interconnected. In other words, 
in order to assess the work of the VSPR organs, it is necessary 
to establish the degree of conceptual uniformity in the measures 
applied. 
  Second, it is necessary to assess the justification for 
every 
measure and its specific objective. The specialist must 
understand clearly why at any given moment he applies a specific 
measure and to a specific extent. 
  Third, each measure applied by the VSPR organs must be 
assessed in terms of how well it meets professional standards, 
as well as how effective it is in accomplishing its designated 
purpose. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to take into consideration to what 
degree the measures applied by the VSPR organs reflect all the 
directions of our work, beginning with the methodological and 
experimental spheres and ending with that of individual 
education. 
  Fifth, VSPR professionals must posssess thorough and 
comprehensive information about the real state of affairs in 
their sphere. 
  This set of indicators of the activity of the organs of the 
VSPR makes it possible to give an objective and integral 
assessment of the quality of this work. 
  Simplifying the system of assessment, reducing it to merely 
quantitative indicators, cannot be allowed, because this will 
inevitably lead to a surrogate level in practice. 
  Another vitally important question concerns the ways in 
which 
the VSPR organs make a practical contribution to the overall 
assessment of the state of military discipline as a basis for 
planning further work in this field. 
  Only those categories that belong to the sociopsychological 
field can be subject to sociopsychological analysis. With 
respect to military discipline, this category is the state of 
discipline of personnel. Thus the role of the VSPR organs in the 
overall assessment of the state of military discipline is to 
conduct a thoroughgoing professional assessment of the state of 
discipline of personnel, which must be based on: 
  -- a general statistical record of violations of military 
discipline, which are kept by the military staffs; 
  -- a legal analysis of the situation, which is conducted by 
the legal specialists in the VSPR organs; 
  -- an understanding of the social processes in the Armed 
Forces arrived at with the help of sociological studies; 
  -- a deep understanding of the psychological and 
psychophysiological factors that operate in military subunits 
and affect the level of discipline; 
  -- the results of a study specifically designed to analyze 
the level of the state of discipline of personnel in units and 
subunits using the methods of sociopsychological research. We 
have already discussed how this can be done. 
  Thus, only a scientific approach, based on an analysis of 
the 
daily activity of the VSPR organs, can bring positive results in 
the activity of professional educators and promote a high level 
of discipline among personnel.

"Minister of Defense at Air Force Training"] 
  [Text] As we reported earlier, Air Force command staff 
training is continuing in accordance with the plan for combat 
training of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
  Defense Minister General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy 
visited the headquarters of the Air Force of Ukraine in 
Vinnytsya. As the person ultimately in charge of training, the 
minister heard reports from Lt. Gen. Volodymyr Antonets, the 
commander of the Air Force, Maj. Gen. Yuriy Petrov, chief of 
staff of the Air Force, and the chiefs of directorates and 
services and set them the task of working out how the country's 
Air Force will be used in strategic defense operations by the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy stressed the need for more thoroughly 
working out the combat missions in such training exercises, 
because they offer an opportunity for commanders at all levels 
to attain theoretical and practical skills in leading troops. 
  The chief of Ukraine's War Office visited the helicopter 
regiment stationed in Vinnytsya. Here, Vitaliy Radetskyy 
acquainted himself with the everyday life of personnel and the 
conditions in which the helicopter troops carry out their 
military duty. It was evident that the members of this unit and 
their families are experiencing considerable social and everyday 
hardships. Despite these difficulties, the aviators are 
executing the tasks they have been assigned. This was confirmed 
by the efficient performance of the pair on duty: On the defense 
minister's command, the helicopters rose into the air, 
significantly exceeding the accepted standard. 
  The main subject discussed during the meeting of the defense 
minister with the regiment personnel was the need to focus 
attention on the problems of the army and to begin solving them 
as quickly as possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya, </F>
correspondent of NARODNA ARMIYA: "The Exercises Have Been 
Completed. Training Is Continuing"] 
  [Text] As reported 
earlier, Ukrainian Air Force command staff exercises were 
conducted from 29 to 31 March. After these were completed, Col. 
Gen. Ivan Bizhan conducted a detailed analysis of the exercises 
and summed up their results at the Main Headquarters of the Air 
Force, which is located in Vinnytsya. 
  In his speech to the Air Force leadership, he noted, first 
and foremost, that although the global threat of war breaking 
out in the world no longer exists, there is an increased threat 
of local regional conflicts flaring up. To prevent this, it is 
necessary not only to have Armed Forces, but also to maintain 
them in a combat ready state. This is why it is essential to 
conduct a wide variety of exercises and training. 
  The main goal of the unilateral two-stage command staff 
exercises that were conducted on the base of the Directorate of 
the Air Force of Ukraine, the air army, and the groups of 
long-distance and transport aviation was to hone the 
professional skills of commanders at all levels, as well as to 
improve coordination of action among the organs of the 
directorate and with the Anti-Aircraft Defense Forces [PPO] and 
the aviation [component] of the Naval Forces. 
  Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan made a point of stressing that no 
neighboring state was imagined in the role of the enemy during 
the exercises. The enemy forces were called "Western" and 
"Southwestern." These were imaginary states and their armed 
forces. Standing against them were the "Eastern" forces -- i.e., 
Ukraine and her Armed Forces. 
  The "legend" or condition underlying the command staff 
exercise was one possible variant of the eruption of an armed 
conflict and the launching of military actions against our 
state. The exercise anticipated military action on a rather wide 
front, up to five massive air strikes, amphibious landings, etc. 
  The "Eastern" forces developed plans for committing the Air 
Force to action and conducting a defensive air operation in 
three phases. 
  How well did they succeed? In his speech, the deputy 
minister 
of defense noted that, on the whole, the exercise had been 
performed according to the established guidelines. The plan for 
the conduct of the military actions, which had been presented to 
the chief of training, General of the Army Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy, by the commander of the Air Force, Lt. Gen. 
Volodymyr Antonets, generally met the standards of the task that 
had been set. The solutions implemented by the commanders of the 
air armies and aviation groups were also well-considered and 
appropriate to the simulated war conditions. However, a number 
of shortcomings were noted in the performance of the command 
structures. 
  The higher the command or staff, the more clearly defined 
and 
coordinated must be their activities. This was not always the 
case, noted Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan. He pointed out the 
shortcomings in the performance of specific officers. At the 
same time, he named the officers who perform their military 
duties conscientiously. Col. Leonid Podnosov, chief of 
intelligence of the 14th Air Army, exhibited a particularly high 
standard of professionalism and the ability to organize activity 
during the exercise in a timely and productive manner. 
  These exercises demonstrated that problems can crop up where 
there should be no problems whatsoever -- in the system of 
relaying commands, battle plan instructions, and orders. These 
were sometimes late in reaching those who had to execute them. 
  It was also noted that in planning such exercises, it is 
necessary to take into account the real state of affairs in the 
forces and the possible options for action in the event of a 
military threat. This will force commanders to prepare their 
subordinates with greater clarity of purpose in their everyday 
military training. And to create military structures in 
peacetime that in the face of a military threat will require the 
least number of structural changes, basing redeployment, and 
changes in stationing locations. It is necessary to create 
universal air bases at military airfields to service all types 
of aircraft, both in peacetime and in wartime. 
  Other conclusions were also drawn on the basis of these 
exercises. The most important of these for future work, as the 
deputy defense minister noted, is that the training of staff 
officers must be significantly improved. This requires 
implementing the principle whereby a superior trains his 
subordinates. 
  In conclusion, Col. Gen. Bizhan stated that he was confident 
that the military aviators would succeed in overcoming all the 
difficulties of this transitional period now that Lt. Gen. 
Volodymyr Antonets had assumed command over them, because their 
new commander has a great deal of experience, energy, ability, 
and all the other qualities necessary for working selflessly and 
productively.

<F P=106> [Press Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine: "The </F>
Problems of Aviators Will Be Solved Expeditiously"] 
  [Text] On 2 April of this year, General of the Army Defense 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy paid a planned working visit to 
Myrhorod, the headquarters of a Ukrainian Air Force division. 
  In order to gain a real understanding of the situation among 
the military and the problems facing the people wearing shoulder 
boards, the chief of the War Office [kerivnyk viyskovoho 
vidomstva] invited Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Valeriy 
Shmarov to accompany him on this visit. 
  Together they inspected the airfield and the aviators' 
military town, visited the barracks, the soldiers' mess, and the 
military trade store. Virtually everything was of interest to 
the minister and the deputy prime minister -- the conditions in 
which personnel live, whether the store carries fresh bread, 
what the soldiers and officers are fed, and whether they have 
all the necessities. 
  The representatives of the government also visited the homes 
of some aviators and met with the residents of the military 
town. There is no shortage of problems here. The deputy prime 
minister and the defense minister promised to solve some of 
these problems expeditiously. Thus the officers and soldiers 
[o/s] would receive their pay in the next few days, and 
according to the defense minister's instruction, the pharmacy in 
the town will be opened in a week's time. 
  In order to check the combat readiness and training of the 
aviators, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy issued an order 
commanding the air units on duty to fly. The section commander, 
Maj. Mykhaylo Moroz, and Senior Airman Volodymyr Kovpakov 
performed their task efficiently. The handsome SU-27s they flew 
rose into the air exceeding the accepted standard, and the 
fighter pilots performed their training exercise successfully. 
The defense minister thanked them for doing a good job. 
  Such visits to the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 
enable us to gain first-hand knowledge of the situation in the 
military and persuade us of the need to focus our attention on 
army problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Lt. Col. Nykyfor Lysytsya, special correspondent </F>
of NARODNA ARMIYA: "Apropos the Results of the Academic Year. 
The Word `Flier' Comes From the Term `To Fly'"] 
  [Text] There are lately more and more officers who have 
only rarely lifted their airplanes into the skies during the 
past academic year. The 14th Air Army alone numbers 62 such 
pilots. An additional 74 young pilots have each spent only five 
to six hours in the air. The average flight time among the air 
fighters amounts to a little over 20 hours each. 
  Much has already been said about this state of affairs. Let 
me, therefore, confine myself to noting that the main reason for 
this is a lack of fuel. The so-called rotation of flight 
personnel -- in other words, transferring officers from one unit 
to another -- has also played a negative role in this. The 
situation is difficult. 
  What is the solution? After all, we do not anticipate a 
significant improvement in the provision of material-technical 
supplies for flights in the coming academic year. 
  These issues have been raised on many occasions at various 
conferences, seminars, and meetings in the air army, which is 
under the command of Lt. Gen. Viktor Lyashenko. Working 
together, they arrived at certain conclusions and drew up some 
specific recommendations. 
  To begin with, they decided to ensure that the best trained 
specialists --the airmen first class and the airmen-snipers -- 
maintain their proficiency level. This solution is quite 
justified. The combat capability and combat readiness of the air 
units and subunits depend on these people. As a rule, they can 
also serve as instructors, as so-called auxiliary instructors, 
for those who care about their professional training. In 
addition, an airman first class needs significantly fewer hours 
in the air to maintain his skills than an airman second class, 
and fewer still than an airman third class. This also means that 
they use much less airplane fuel, which is in short supply. 
  Hence, the main combat crews on airplanes and helicopters 
are 
composed, as a rule, of airmen with the highest qualification. 
They fly more flights. And they are first to be issued fuel. 
  That is how things were done this year. But it will be 
necessary to abandon this principle next year. First, the number 
of airmen first class is growing smaller -- many are being 
discharged into the reserves. Some are losing their ranking 
because of other objective reasons. Second, a large gap is 
developing between the different strata of flight personnel. 
Those who were ranked second and third class are now lagging 
behind and losing their qualification. Metaphorically speaking, 
the forest is being left without new growth, and this will 
inevitably produce negative results. 
  That is why they decided to include airmen second class and 
even airmen third class in the main fighter crews -- to enable 
them to fly and improve their skills. But they will select only 
promising officers for this, born aviators, as they say, whom a 
minimum number of flight hours will suffice not only to maintain 
their qualification, but also to raise it. 
  And what will happen to those who are not included in the 
main combat crews? 
  This year they were assigned to the training regiments, 
where 
flights are conducted on L-39's. This, at least, allowed them to 
retain the level of airman second or third class. 
  They plan to continue this practice during the next academic 
year as well. However, the leadership of the Air Force needs to 
take the necessary steps to organize this form of additional 
training at the proper level. There were times when airmen who 
had been assigned to fly were ignored by practically everybody. 
As a result, the issue of raising qualifications did not arise, 
even though considerable sums of money were spent. 
  Today, we cannot afford not to think and not to be concerned 
about the future of military aviation. And this future lies with 
the lieutenants raduating this year from military schools. They 
do not yet have a class qualification. They also have much less 
flight experience. Suffice it to say that their graduation from 
school was postponed for a month because of a shortage of fuel 
for scheduled training. 
  The regiments to which they have been assigned are also hard 
up for airplane fuel. The lieutenants cannot expect to make solo 
flights in the cabins of fighter planes in the near future. 
Consequently, the leadership of the air army proposed to gather 
all the young pilots into one training regiment, assign 
experienced instructors to this unit, and organize further 
training for these airmen. This will enable them to raise their 
qualification to airman third class. Then, if they are not 
assigned to the main combat crews, it will be possible to 
maintain them as a reserve of class specialists [klasni 
spetsialisty]. 
  It is essential that the proposals put foward above find 
official support from the Ministry of Defense. The creation of a 
training regiment composed of lieutenants and other 
organizational measures deserve serious attention, as well as 
the allocation of funds. In the end, these costs will inevitably 
prove to have been justified. After all, this is a matter of 
investing funds in a cause that is vital to the state.

<F P=106> [Article by Senior Lt. Yuriy Povkh, under the rubric "The </F>
National Army": "Clipped Wings, or Why Have Innocent Young 
Pilots Proved Guilty?"] 
  [Text] Breaking the silence of the frosty winter morning, 
the silver-winged fighter planes thundered over the town. Its 
residents, who have lately grown unaccustomed to regular 
flights, watched in amazement as the ferociously elegant MIGs 
performed steep 360-degree turns. A flight day was beginning. 
  This was a day out of the ordinary for the pilots of the 
fighter regiment. For some, this meant the opportunity to rise 
once again into the skies, feel themselves masters in the air, 
see for themselves how obediently their fearsome military 
machines were behaving -- these marvels of late 
twentieth-century engineering. Yet, the usual bravura intonation 
was lacking in the words "out of the ordinary": One could hear 
undisguised bitterness and sadness in the voices of the pilots 
when the talk turned to flying. Why? Because they compared the 
flights they had just completed to offering a drop of water to 
someone dying of thirst in the desert. 
  That is why the pilots took extreme care as they lifted 
their 
winged machines into the sky. Moreover, the weather that day did 
not give them much joy: Dense snow that hid the horizon 
alternated with brilliant sunshine. At times, this produced a 
kind of "cocktail" -- a term used by the aviators to describe 
difficult weather conditions -- over the airfield and the 
designated flying zone. 
  Nonetheless, none of this prevented Col. V. Yavorskyy, the 
commander of the regiment, and his subordinates from 
demonstrating their excellent flying skills. Thus, Maj. Valeriy 
Nedbay, the senior navigator, performed his assignment with 
distinction by executing a difficult flight, hitting his target, 
and landing with the help of stand-by controls. An equal degree 
of proficiency was exhibited by Maj. Vyacheslav Kamchatnyy and 
Maj. Mykola Onyshchenko, captains Andriy Lyashenko, Vyacheslav 
Kovalenko, Vitaliy Bryzhadov, and others. In other words, they 
showed that "there was still powder in the old powder horns." 
  Unfortunately, however, many pilots, who are regarded as 
young, were not given the opportunity to rise into the skies. 
All they could do was watch their colleagues from the ground. 
  Captain Viktor Ostapenko was one of those who remained on 
the 
ground. As it turned out, this had nothing to do with his age. 
He has been an officer for five years. Under the earlier 
standards, he would have been wearing the insignia of airman 
second class for the last two years. But this has not happened. 
This is not because of any failing on Viktor's part. Nor can we 
talk of failings on the part of any of the other pilots; we need 
only recall that they are often called peculiar because of their 
fanatical devotion to the skies. It is the chronic scarcity of 
fuel that has clipped the wings of Ostapenko and his colleagues, 
(he is hardly alone). 
  As a result, the airman has meager flight experience. During 
all of last year, he spent only four hours in the air. An absurd 
figure, to say the least. But even this figure is misleading, 
because Capt. Ostapenko spent the lion's share of this time on 
routine testing of the level of his proficiency. Every fighter 
pilot has to undergo such testing during the year. This is 
hardly a matter of improving flying skills; it is a matter of 
not losing the level of qualification already attained. 
  For the sake of comparison, let me say that a pilot in the 
U.S. Air Force, who has flown fewer than 50 hours in any year, 
is regarded as potentially accident-prone and is kept under 
watchful observation by his command. 
  Obviously, it would be wrong to say that everything has been 
allowed to drift in the regiment and that good bread is being 
wasted on the pilots. Clearly, the command of the regiment does 
not currently have the forces and means that are at the disposal 
of the armies of developed countries. Consequently, the unit is 
conducting systematic instruction closely linked with combat 
training. The pilots are improving their theoretical knowledge 
and tempering their bodies physically. (Most often, this 
consists of cross-country races [kros], which, through the irony 
of fate, are conducted on the landing strip). Instruction on the 
shooting range is not at all rare these days. In a word, Col. 
Yavorskyy is doing everything in his power to ensure that the 
regiment assigned to him should remain a fighting unit. 
  But you must admit that the pilot's job is to fight in the 
air and not on the ground. What will be the consequences of this 
kind of "freeze" in the training of air personnel? I heard the 
answer to this question from Lt. Col. Mykola Horyachov, senior 
airman and inspector of the rayon directorate of the 
anti-aircraft defense force [PPO]. Commenting on the existing 
situation, he said: 
  "At present, there has been a virtual halt in the training 
of 
young pilots in the regiment for reasons that we all know. Small 
wonder, therefore, that potentially promising officers, who have 
served for five to seven years, are openly admitting that they 
are afraid to fly. `If things go on this way, there will be more 
takeoffs than landings,' say the pilots. And they are right. 
Because the making of a professional pilot has always been 
closely linked with the mentorship or more experienced pilots. 
Unfortunately, we do not have this today. It is always easier to 
destroy something than to build it. The `old men' will retire in 
a few years, and the young lads will not even have an 
opportunity to feel the safety of wings. Because the experience 
amassed in bits and pieces by more than one generation of 
fighter pilots will remain unutilized. There is absolutely no 
doubt that all of this will have a negative impact on the future 
fate of the aviation of Ukraine's anti-aircraft defense 
component [PPO]." 
  A pessimistic prognosis, as you can see. One would very much 
like to believe that Lt. Col. M. Horyachyy's words are not 
prophetic. But reality dictates its own logic. A closer 
examination reveals that the problem is not solely confined to 
the fuel shortage. The technical condition of the airplanes 
themselves is also of concern to everybody. First and foremost, 
the condition of the so- 
called "sparok", which are used to train pilots and to refresh 
their skills. There are only two such planes left in the 
regiment. A third has been sent for repairs to Russia, and, it 
appears, that is the end of that trainer airplane. The regiment 
cannot perform these intricate repairs on its own. Our eastern 
neighbor also makes new spare parts and motors. How are these 
training fighter planes, which require continual maintenance 
because they are the most frequently used, to be kept in the 
proper technical condition? In other words, even if fuel were to 
become available, regular flights might not be possible. 
  It might be possible to partly maintain pilot training at 
the 
necessary level by using flight simulators. But this, too, is 
not as simple as it sounds. These expensive machines were left 
at the previous location where the regiment was stationed, and 
now the lack of funds makes it difficult to transport them to 
the regiment's new headquarters. They cannot be transported like 
bricks, because they are delicate machines, filled with 
electronics. Moreover, the need for repeated assembly will 
inevitably have an adverse effect on the future use of these 
flight simulators. 
  And so, like Mohammed who was forced to go to the mountain 
when it failed to come to him, the pilots now travel hundreds of 
kilometers to "fly" the flight simulators; moreover, spending 
large sums of both the state's and their own money to do so. 
  But the flight simulators are not the most serious problem 
to 
have resulted from the redeployment of the regiment. The move 
itself shook the whole system of the aviators' lives to its very 
foundations, as they say. Specifically because of the 
relocation, some dozen and a half pilots, most of whom held 
command posts, have left the regiment. And those who remained 
were adversely affected by this "experiment." It "ran over them" 
like a steam roller. The equipment was transported, but 
apparently no one gave much thought to the people. The following 
statistics tell the whole sad story: 40 percent of the officers 
and warrant officers have apartments at their former place of 
service. And those who had no apartments to begin with have sent 
their families to live with their parents. They themselves live 
in barracks. 
  Recently, still another problem was added to all the 
problems 
that the regiment already has: Complete disarray in providing 
the regiment with financial security. Not once have the aviators 
received their pay on time at their new location. The delays 
have lasted up to a month. On the day that I visited the 
regiment, the delay had substantially exceeded even this period 
of time. And there is no one to complain to that you have a 
family and children, who need to eat every day. As to the 
transfer pay that is to be paid when a serviceman is stationed 
to a new location, close to 40 percent of the officers and 
warrant officers simply never got it. By now, the galloping 
inflation has "eaten up" this money. 
  Small wonder that in this difficult situation requests for 
discharge from the Armed Forces have come down like autumn 
leaves. Close to two dozen pilots (!) and thirty engineers and 
technicians have expressed their desire to leave the army. The 
pilots are not deterred even by the fact that they are unlikely 
to find a job in their specialty in civilian life. Currently, 
civil aviation's own pilots do not know what to do with 
themselves. Moreover, it is no easy matter to retrain a fighter 
ace into a civilian slow-speed cruiser [tykhokhid]. The 
difference between these two kinds of flying equipment is 
approximately as great as between a Formula-one racing car and 
the Zaporozhets. 
  Nevertheless, those who have decided to leave the army are 
resolved to do so at any price. Some are even prepared to give 
up their pensions -- their rightful reward for service -- just 
as long as they are allowed to leave. But the highest staff does 
not act on the requests of these officers, and, in my view, the 
given situation was very aptly described by one of those who 
wants to leave: 
  "It is as if we had been sold into slavery -- they neither 
allow us to serve nor to leave." 
  Incidentally, the overwhelming majority of officers who have 
expressed a desire to be discharged into the reserves are airmen 
first class -- the army's golden fund, as it were, the mentors 
of the young. How can one help but recall the words of Lt. Col. 
Horyachyy? 
  They say that the pilots who do not have the opportunity to 
fly in their units will soon be sent to flight schools. There 
they will once again pilot training airplanes. Undoubtedly, even 
this desperate step could keep the situation under control for a 
while. But for how long? Will this provide a fundamental 
solution to the problem, considering that these schools are 
themselves maintained on "starvation rations"? 
  It seems to me that the processes that are currently under 
way in the aviation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are becoming 
more and more reminiscent of a well-planned diversion, aimed at 
depriving the country of its fighter aviation in the shortest 
possible time. Judging by the statements of some people's 
deputies, they still fail to understand (three years later) the 
need for an army, regarding it as no more than an obedient 
supplier of military equipment that can be sold to fill some of 
the holes in the state budget. 
  To be sure, equipment can be replaced in time (although 
this, 
too, is very problematical), but what to do about the people who 
when asked on the questionnaire "Will you serve in the Armed 
Forces if the present situation remains unchanged?" unanimously 
anwered "No!" 
  A pilot must fly. Always, the harshest punishment for a 
pilot 
was to be kept from flying. Today, through no fault of their 
own, most flight personnel have been punished in just such a 
way. And now the once most combat capable regiment, which has 
glorious military traditions and a huge collective store of 
experience, is being forced to give up one by one the high 
positions it had won. Just a short time ago, its pilots were the 
visiting card, as it were, of all our Armed Forces. There is 
hardly a high-ranking guest to whom they did not demonstrate 
their skills -- in the skies of Ukraine, as well as abroad! 
  Here is but one situation that I witnessed. I recall the 
outburst of astonishment from those present in the fall of last 
year at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 
liberation of Kiev, when the fighter pilots emerged out of a 
thick fog and streaked like lightning above the steep banks of 
the Dnieper. On that occasion, they did what few aviators are 
able to do... 
  I firmly believe that pilots are born. Naturally, you can 
teach a person to operate a complicated fighting machine and to 
transport large shipments, but you cannot instill a love of the 
sky in an individual. This requires an inner passion of the 
soul, a vocation -- a strong amalgam of strength, courage, and 
will. The celebrated French writer and professional pilot, 
Antoine de St. Exupery, was a thousand times right when he wrote 
that he would give all the gold in the world to experience just 
one flight. 
  Apart from this purely spiritual aspect, there is also an 
economic one. This, too, cannot be overlooked. 
  * * * 
  Have you ever considered how much the state spends to train 
a 
single pilot? It turns out that it spends the same amount as to 
train twenty physicians! And all these funds come from the 
pockets of taxpayers. That being the case, should we treat our 
pilots in such a thoughtless manner and clip their wings?

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya, special </F>
correspondent of NARODNA ARMIYA: "Flight Safety: The Desirable 
and the Possible"] 
  [Text] In most cases, man's first attempts to leave the 
earth and fly above it like a bird for even a short while ended 
in tragedy. Thus, from the very birth of aviation, the problem 
of flight safety assumed paramount importance for those who 
tried to conquer the skies. It was, after all, not enough to 
rise into the air; just as important was the ability to land 
safely without injury either to self or flying machine. This was 
the goal towards which inventors, designers, and pilots worked 
-- all those who were fascinated by the idea of "wings." And as 
history confirms, as aviation engineering and science developed 
and piloting skills were mastered, the probability of accidents 
during flights fell hundreds of times, and it became much safer 
to rise into the air. 
  Still, even with our modern aviation equipment, highly 
perfected means for ensuring the safety of flights, and 
thoroughly equipped airfields, tragic accidents, or flight 
incidents as aviators call them, or even catastrophes, do 
happen, unfortunately. Consequently, flight safety remains and 
will probably continue to remain perhaps the most important 
concern of aviators, and especially of military aviators. 
  To some extent, objective circumstances have made this 
problem even more acute for the Air Force of Ukraine. Some of 
these reasons were discussed at the conference on flight safety 
recently held by the 14th Air Army. 
  To begin with, it was noted that the shortage of fuel and 
lubricants, spare parts, and funds has caused the intensity of 
flight training to decrease substantially, and the expertise of 
pilots in the principal categories of training, especially in 
difficult weather conditions [SUM] and at night, to drop. The 
expertise of the flight operations groups (HKP) has decreased 
for the same reason. A significant number of specialists have 
been discharged into the reserves. They have been replaced by 
new people who lack sufficient experience in flight operations 
and control. 
  Objective difficulties in obtaining spare parts and 
machinery 
for communications equipment and for the electronic support of 
flights and for airfield equipment are reducing the reliability 
with which these function; and this, too, has a negative impact 
on flight safety. Aviators are also plagued by other problems 
with respect to material-technical supply. However, despite 
everything, last year the 14th Air Army had no serious flight 
incidents -- at least, there were no catastrophes. There is no 
point in discussing at length how they managed this. The most 
important thing, after all, is to hope that disasters continue 
to pass by the aviators this year as well. Relying on God alone 
is hardly enough; concrete steps need to be taken to ensure 
flight safety. One such measure was the conference we have 
already mentioned. The goal of the conference was to prevent the 
level of flight safety from dropping in our difficult times by 
having experienced pilots and other specialists prepare specific 
recommendations on the basis of a detailed analysis of flight 
incidents and their causes. 
  Sad though it may be, in matters pertaining to preventing 
accidents, aviators learn from their mistakes and the mistakes 
of others. And, as we know, it is better to learn from the 
mistakes of others. Hence, in their collectives, they analyze 
each accident, catastrophe, and the causes of each in 
considerable detail. This was also done at the conference. 
  A detailed analysis of the flight safety record of the 
formation's units during the last five years was conducted. 
There were four flight incidents in the air army during this 
period -- one catastrophe, one accident, and two incidents in 
which planes were damaged. Four men died, an MI-24 helicopter 
and a MIG-29 were lost, and two other planes were damaged: an 
AN-12 and a MIG-29. A few other tragic air accidents occurred in 
the units that were recently added to the 14th Air Army. As we 
can see, there is plenty of negative experience here from which 
to learn. 
  What are the main causes of accidents and catastrophes? The 
results of the investigations conducted in the case of each 
accident confirm that the leading causes are pilot errors 
resulting from an inadequate level of professional training on 
the part of fliers. Moreover, the majority of accidents involved 
young specialists who held the post of airman or senior airman. 
  In addition to the leading causes of flight incidents, the 
other subjects considered included shortcomings in the 
organization and ensuring [zabezpechennya] of flights and in the 
performance of personnel in the flight operations groups, who 
were responsible to some degree for the negative outcome in each 
specific case. 
  Here is what happened in each specific instance. Senior Lt. 
Airman V. Burskyy, flying at a low altitude in an assigned area, 
after performing a 360-degree banked turn, decided to change the 
sweep angle of the wing. As a result, he turned his attention 
away from his altitude and the wing of his plane caught the tops 
of the trees. The result was a crash. 
  On 16 May 1991, Senior Airman Lt. I. Halchenkov was flying a 
MIG-29. His mission was to carry out an air "battle" with a 
low-altitude slow-flying air target. The pilot found himself in 
an emergency after completing his fourth attack. At a height of 
a little over a kilometer, he failed to pay careful attention to 
the indicators on his instrument panel and lost lateral control. 
The pilot became confused and, persuaded that the airplane was 
not responding to the control stick, he ejected. The plane 
crashed into the ground... 
  The most typical accident caused by shortcomings in the 
organization and flight operations control occurred on 24 
January 1989. The crew of a MI-24 helicopter led by Capt. S. 
Roztorhuyev was performing an uncomplicated flight exercise. One 
minute and 40 seconds after takeoff, at an altitude of 220 
meters, the helicopter, banking to the right and increasing its 
angle of descent, hit the ground and burned. 
  The direct cause of the catastrophe was the loss by the 
commander of the crew of his sense of direction as he suddenly 
found himself in the clouds, because he had insufficient 
training to fly in such conditions. In addition, he had turned 
away his attention to visually search for a second helicopter 
flying alongside. But the principal cause was a series of 
serious violations and shortcomings in the organization and 
control of flights, which, unfortunately, became evident only 
during the investigation following the crash. Capt. S. 
Roztorhuyev came to the regiment from Afghanistan and did not 
begin to fly until three months later. Such a long gap is 
inadmissible. The number of actual flights required to restore 
lost piloting skills before being put into active service had 
been cut in half. Before the day of the catastrophe, the pilot 
had not refreshed his training to operate a helicopter at night 
or in difficult weather conditions. As a specialist third class, 
he had virtually no experience in this kind of flying. Moreover, 
the commander of the regiment had scheduled flights in normal 
weather conditions, whereas by then the conditions were in fact 
difficult and growing worse. 
  The flight operations officer on the landing ground, Maj. P. 
Zhreleyev, lacking adequate professional training, did not apply 
safety measures in the zone for which he was responsible in 
time. When the situation in the air became an emergency, he lost 
his head and gave no command. 
  The sad conclusion drawn from the above -- a chain of 
violations of flight regulations and negligence in the 
performance of their jobs by a number of people in responsible 
posts. 
  What conclusions can be drawn from the examples cited above? 
First and foremost, there must be a scrupulous and very concrete 
approach in full compliance with all regulations to allowing a 
pilot to fly, depending on weather conditions, the difficulty of 
the flight mission, and the level of the pilot's training and 
experience. This must be implemented on the basis of accepted 
standards outlined in existing regulations. 
  In connection with a rather marked tendency towards a 
decline 
in the professional level of flight personnel for reasons cited 
above and the lack of opportunities for conducting the necessary 
number of flights, much more attention must be devoted to the 
ground training of the air soldiers. This training should 
include theoretical studies, as well as training in the cabins 
of airplanes and helicopters, and such. The flight simulators, 
which often stood idle in the past, should also be used to full 
capacity. 
  The specialists in the aviation-engineering service must 
triple their level of care to prevent the possibility of flights 
being undertaken in winged machines that are in a state of 
disrepair. Particular attention should be paid to those 
airplanes and helicopters that are reaching the end of their 
service life or require repairs. You cannot, after all, fix a 
breakdown in the air. Just as much diligence, a responsible 
attitude to their jobs, and reliable care for equipment and how 
it performs are required of all specialists in airfield, 
weather, and medical services, flight operations groups, and 
others. 
  Obviously, the best way to improve flight safety is to 
supply 
all the necessary fuel and lubricants and spare parts needed for 
conducting the full schedule of flights on regular aviation 
equipment. This, however, is something that we can only wish 
for. Our present reality is somewhat different. And it requires 
that we do everything possible, and even the impossible, to 
ensure that the number of landings equals the number of takeoffs 
by the airplanes and helicopters of the Air Force of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Vitaliy Denisov </F>
under the "Events and Comments" rubric: "Peace Arrives; 
Continuation of War Deemed Impossible"] 
  [Text] The end of March was marked by further escalation of 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. According to Abkhazian sources, 
the Abkhazians' offensive was crowned by their taking certain 
populated localities and establishing complete control of the 
Kodorskiy Pass. At the same time, the Ministry of Defense Press 
Center of the Georgian Republic is not entirely clear in its 
statement regarding the skirmishes occurring there. 
  Georgian state head Eduard Shevardnadze, refuting to some 
extent the reports of his own Ministry of Defense, stated in a 
parliamentary session that in the last several days there has 
been a definite stabilization of the situation in Abkhazian 
Svanetia. He stressed that "Georgian authorities have not 
exhibited any military initiative." The republic intends to 
maintain a peaceful course until it exhausts all possibilities 
of a peaceful settlement. 
  In this connection, it pays to keep in mind that Tbilisi at 
first awaited an "historic resolution by the U.N." However, 
hopes for active intercession by this organization in the 
settlement process have not been realized. The U.N. 
secretary-general closed his report to the Security Council with 
the conclusion that conditions do not presently exist for the 
deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia. 
  Tbilisi's attempt to resolve the Abkhazian problem with as 
little bloodshed as possible and, essentially, by the use of 
outside forces, is understandable, since Georgia is simply 
incapable of waging a war due to political, economic, and a 
number of other factors. 
  It is presently difficult to say what further actions the 
Georgian authorities will take. However, it is obvious that they 
have no appetite for reinstituting large-scale combat 
activities. Hence the insistent petitioning of the Russian 
leadership, which will react, as Tbilisi expects, in a more 
positive manner compared to that of the world community. Hence 
the quite open discussion of the possible outcome: Abkhazia's 
becoming a Russian protectorate, one in which a military 
presence will be virtually legitimized. 
  It is true that experts do not exclude another possibility. 
The insertion of Russian peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia will 
not be detrimental to the Georgian Republic's sovereignty and 
its territorial integrity. This may also cool the ardor of the 
Gudauta leaders and force them to seek compromises at the 
conference table, since the last rounds of talks produced 
virtually nothing positive. In any event, the essential 
consideration is that Georgia is willing to sacrifice quite a 
bit to avoid waging a new large-scale and bloody war.

  Statute on the Procedure for Controlling Exports From 
the Russian Federation of Certain Types of Raw and Other 
Materials, Equipment, Technologies, and Scientific-Technical 
Information That Can Have Applications in the Development of 
Weapons and Military Hardware. 
  1. This Statute sets forth a series of measures to control 
exports of certain types of raw and other materials, equipment, 
technologies, and scientific-technical information that can have 
applications in the development of weapons and military hardware 
(referred to hereafter as dual-use goods and services). 
  2. The procedure for controlling exports from the Russian 
Federation of dual-use goods and services shall entail: 
  --the preparation and issuance of authorization findings on 
the export of dual-use goods and services included in the List, 
confirmed by Russian Federation Presidential Directive No. 74-rp 
of February 11, 1994, of certain types of raw and other 
materials, equipment, technologies, and scientific-technical 
information that can have applications in the development of 
weapons and military hardware and whose export is controlled and 
carried out under licenses (referred to hereafter as the List); 
  --the licensing and customs clearance of exports of dual-use 
goods and services. 
  3. All economic entities under the jurisdiction of the 
Russian Federation, regardless of type of ownership, when 
concluding contracts for the export (transfer, exchange) of 
dual-use goods and services included in the List, shall be 
required to specify in the contract text the end users of the 
goods and services being exported, the purpose for which they 
will be used, and undertakings by the importer that the goods 
and services will be used solely for the stated purposes, which 
shall not be related directly or indirectly to the production of 
weapons and military hardware, and will not be re-exported or 
transferred to any party without the exporter's written consent. 
  The undertakings must be specially filed by the importer 
with 
a duly authorized state agency of the importer-country for each 
specific transaction involving the delivery of each exported 
object included in the List, in the form of an international 
(national) import certificate or equivalent document, or, in the 
absence of a procedure for filing an import certificate, in the 
form of a document containing the undertakings specified in 
paragraph one of this point, with a notarized Russian language 
translation. 
  4. In the event of the absence in the importer-country's 
legislation of regulations relating to export controls for 
certain dual-use goods and services or the absence of the 
dual-use goods or services being imported from the Russian 
Federation in the national control list of the importer-country, 
it shall be necessary to present an official document 
(certification) to this effect issued by a duly authorized state 
agency of the importer-country. 
  In this event, the importer's undertakings in the contract 
text shall constitute sufficient grounds for export. An extract 
from the trade register of the importer-country or other 
document confirming the legal status of the foreign importer in 
accordance with the legislation of the country in which it is 
located, with a notarized Russian language translation, shall be 
appended to the aforementioned documents. 
  The contract text must include a mandatory provision 
specifying the exporter's right to verify that the exported 
goods or services are being used for the stated purposes. 
  Verification of compliance with the undertakings of foreign 
importers with respect to the use of dual-use goods and services 
imported from the Russian Federation shall be organized in the 
procedure specified in Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government Decree No. 1030 of October 11, 1993. 
  In the event that efforts to verify compliance with the 
importer's undertakings reveal a breach of those undertakings or 
noncompliance with them, the contract shall be subject to 
dissolution. 
  5. The obtaining of licenses for the export (transfer, 
exchange) of dual-use goods and services included in the List 
shall be mandatory for all economic entities on the territory of 
the Russian Federation, regardless of type of ownership; this 
shall apply to all types of foreign economic activity, including 
direct production and scientific-technical ties, coastal and 
border trade, and barter operations, in accordance with this 
Statute. 
  The export (transfer, exchange) of dual-use goods and 
services included in the List shall be carried out only on the 
basis of one-time licenses issued by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. 
  An export authorization finding for dual-use goods and 
services issued by the Russian Federation government's Russian 
Federation Commission on Export Controls shall constitute 
grounds for the issuance of a license. 
  To obtain such a finding, the following items must be 
submitted to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the 
export control department): A license application completed in 
accordance with the requirements established by the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations; a copy of the 
contract; a copy of the agreement between the Russian producer 
and the exporter (if the export of goods or services is being 
carried out via an intermediary); originals of the documents 
containing the importer's undertakings (if they are absent from 
the contract text) and of the importer-country state agency 
specified in points three and four of this Statute. 
  The export authorization finding shall be issued no later 
than 20 days after the receipt of the aforementioned documents. 
The finding shall be forwarded by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Economics (the export control department) to the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and to 
the applicant. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations 
shall send information on licenses issued on the basis of 
findings issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export 
Controls (in an agreed-upon form) to the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Economics (the export control department). 
  Authorization to re-export shall be issued to Russian 
exporters on the basis of a re-export authorization finding 
issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export Controls. 
To obtain a re-export authorization finding, the Russian 
exporter shall submit to the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Economics (the export control department): notarized copies of 
the foreign importer's contract with the third party containing 
the terms stipulated in point three of this Statute, and a 
document that contains the undertakings that follow from the 
contract and that has been filed with a duly authorized state 
agency of the third party's country in the form of an import 
certificate or other document specified by that country's 
national legislation. 
  6. The temporary export from the Russian Federation of 
equipment (goods), materials, technologies, and 
scientific-technical information included in the List for 
demonstration at exhibits and trade shows and for advertising 
purposes may be carried out without licenses on the basis of a 
finding issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export 
Controls.

foreign contracting parties; and the name of the customs agency 
that will clear the object at customs, along with an undertaking 
by the Russian organization exporting the object to the effect 
that the object will be returned. 
  A temporary export authorization finding shall be issued no 
later than 20 days after receipt of the aforementioned 
documents. The Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the 
export control department) shall send the finding to the 
applicant for submission to the customs agency indicated in the 
finding. A copy of the finding shall be sent to the Russian 
Federation State Customs Committee.

clearing the object for export from the Russian Federation. 
  When equipment (goods), materials, technologies, and 
scientific-technical information included in the List are 
temporarily exported for demonstration at exhibits and trade 
shows and for advertising purposes, the temporary export

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Golotyuk: "Russian Border Troops Dig In In </F>
Expectation of Assault: New Type of Outpost Set Up on 
Tajik-Afghan Border"] 
  [Text] Moscow Border Detachment, 
Tajikistan--Colonel-General Andrei Nikolayev, commander in chief 
of the Russian Border Troops, left Moscow yesterday on a flight 
to Dushanbe. The Russian Border Troops leadership had decided to 
hold a session of the Main Military Council in Tajikistan. This 
unprecedented event--such military council sessions have not 
been held in the field for a very long time--illustrates yet 
again the enormous importance that Moscow attaches to the 
situation on the Afghan border. 
  Even so, there has already been more than enough evidence in 
the past couple of weeks that the Tajik-Afghan border is today 
one of Russian's most important borders, even though it is 
separated from Russia itself by thousands of kilometers. On a 
trip to Dushanbe, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev visited the 
Moscow Border detachment. It was also visited by Russian Defense 
Minister Grachev, who had come to Tajikistan to see maneuvers by 
CIS collective peace-keeping forces. The exercises are being 
held with a view to the possible need to repulse a massive 
invasion of Tajikistan from the south, from Afghanistan. The 
situation on the border even worries Patriarch Aleksiy II of 
Moscow and All Rus, who has told Russian soldiers serving in 
Tajikistan that the "inviolability of the border of Tajikistan 
protects the inviolability of the borders of Russia, as well as 
of Ukraine, Belorussia and other countries." "We have to hold 
these lines, we will not retreat," Lieutenant-General Tymko, 
chief of the Russian Border Troops General Staff, told the 
assembled personnel of the Moscow Border Detachment's 
much-suffering Outpost No. 12. One gets the impression that if, 
God forbid, the Tajik-Afghan border were to be breached, it 
would spell the end of Russia. 
  It is a strange border, to say the least. For a long time, 
the very men serving here could in no way figure it just what 
sort of border were they defending. The border of the Soviet 
Union? But it hasn't existed for a long time. Russia's border? 
Russia is far away. The border of the CIS? That's an abstract 
notion altogether. This vague situation persists in part to this 
day. Border markers with the inscription "inviolable" continue 
to stand along the Pyandzh River to this day, they were built to 
last. Posters and signs at the outposts say: "CIS Borders Are 
Inviolable!" On the faded signs, "CIS" stands out with a fresh 
coat of paint; under it one can clearly make out the initials 
"USSR." But no one here pays attention to such trifles here any 
more. A quite different peculiarity of this border is more 
prominent now--the fact this it is becoming increasingly less 
like a state border and more and more like a forward defense 
line. 
  Outpost No. 12 has been rebuilt--the very one that was 
seized 
and destroyed last July by fighters who slipped in from 
Afghanistan. Well, it's not exactly the same. The old outpost is 
about four kilometers away. Its half-destroyed structures can be 
discerned with a powerful stereo-telescope. You can't go up 
close, the area is heavily mined. In actual fact, there really 
isn't an outpost here. Thin barbed wire along a line of trenches 
covers the top of a 1.5-kilometer hillock. There are a pair of 
dug-in tanks, an armored personnel carrier, dug-in mortars and a 
few dugouts that afford a person at least some protection from 
the penetrating mountain wind and sporadic shelling. And a 
Russian flag on a bent flagpole proudly flies above all this. It 
is a completely new type of border outpost, a creation of the 
post-Soviet era. It is a forward post on the border of a Russian 
sphere of influence. 
  The new Outpost No. 12 has been moved about six kilometers 
back from the actual border. That area is a no man's land 
partially controlled by the border troops and partially 
controlled by their counterparts on the other bank of the 
Pyandzh--mujahedeen groups, and the armed Tajik opposition. In 
effect, several enemy staging grounds are scattered around new 
Outpost No. 12; despite constant skirmishes, efforts to dislodge 
the fighters have been unsuccessful. In April the border troops 
plan to finish mining the main trails leading from the Pyandzh 
to the outpost. In the meantime, they are nearly surrounded. At 
night, fighters approach to within range. And they fire on the 
outpost and launch rockets at it. They can also do this in the 
daytime. Last week two tank crewmen from the outpost who had 
gone for water (the only source is a depression half a kilometer 
below the outpost) encountered some fighters. Fortunately, they 
were able to safely escape. With sentries posted about, the men 
sit at their posts for three or four weeks at a time, becoming 
filthy and half-wild. Then they get a brief R&amp;R, and it's 
back 
into the mountains. 
  Officers and soldiers are in chronic short supply. "Where 
and 
what is in supply in our country?" said Lieutenant Colonel 
Masyuk, shrugging philosophically. Masyuk has seen everything 
in his two years as commander of the Moscow Border Detachment. 
(Incidentally, it's curious how a person undergoes a 
metamorphosis on the Tajik-Afghan border. At our last meeting 18 
months ago, Masyuk was a typical career border officer, albeit 
one serving in a hotspot, it's true. Now he is more like a 
combat officer fighting in a border zone than a border soldier. 
Routine border service is now painfully distant from the Moscow 
commander's responsibilities: Mining strategic areas, conducting 
reconnaissance, setting up a zoned defense, drawing up 
operational plans). As for his subordinates... 
  Yes, the undermanned force has clearly gotten a few 
reinforcements. The border detachment's half-extinct compounds 
have been invigorated somewhat. A few families sent to Russia 
during at the height of the tension in Tajikistan have returned. 
The Moscow Border Detachment has even opened a mini-school for 
officers' young children. But the number of those who serve here 
on a permanent basis is becoming fewer and fewer. The border 
detachments are switching to a system of getting officers based 
on a so-called "tour" method. They are sent here from other 
Russian border districts for six to 18 months. "At least a 
person knows for sure that this hell is going to end sometime," 
some of them told me. However, a temporary worker is temporary. 
The detachments have given these officers an unflattering 
(excuse me) nickname--"tampexes." I don't think one need explain 
the meaning. 
  "The timing of the Main Military Council field meeting is no 
accident," explained Lt-Gen Tymko. "The hardest time to guard 
the state border--summer--is beginning, and the situation here 
is especially unstable at that time. And judging from how much 
combat equipment and manpower are concentrated on the opposite 
bank of the Pyandzh, this spring can't help but give rise to 
special apprehensions. Intelligence has reported unprecedented 
preparations by the mujahedeen and opposition fighters to storm 
the border. We have to be ready to not only guard it but also 
defend it." 
  Incidentally, guarding and defending are fundamentally 
different notions. The concept of border service has always 
proceeded exclusively from the mission of guarding a border. A 
border soldier with a dog on patrol, a neatly plowed observation 
zone, an insidious intruder hobbling across the border on cow 
hooves--all that is from the realm of guard duty. But the border 
realities here constitute pure defense, for which the border 
troops have never been trained, for which they were never 
intended. The most the border guards are supposed to do is to 
engage an enemy advancing from the adjacent side and hold him 
until regular army units arrive. The "green caps" on the 
Tajik-Afghan border began fighting such battles several years 
ago. And they continue to hold their position, waiting for the 
army to move up. But what army? From where?

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant-General Boris Agapov, vice </F>
president of Ingushetia, by Rodion Morozov, occasion, date and 
place not specified, under rubric "Opinion": "Boris Agapov: `The 
State Border Has Collapsed'; Previous Spirit of Border Troops 
Has Been Lost Irretrievably"; photograph of Agapov included] 
  [Text] Even today, Lieutenant General Boris Agapov is 
a very authoritative person in the Border Troops, despite the 
fact that it has been almost a year since he parted with them. 
In late 1991 and early 1992 Agapov, at that time deputy chairman 
for operations work (intelligence and counterintelligence) of 
the Committee for Security of the USSR State Border, was one of 
those who insisted: "The Border Troops must be common [for all]. 
This is not a structure to be pulled down first of all by 
dragging it apart to national quarters." But a different 
approach predominated. In the interview presented, Agapov, now 
vice president of Ingushetia, discusses the consequences of this 
and the present situation of the Border Troops. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] The Border Troops have lived a 
very troubled life for the last two and one-half years. First 
they are removed from the USSR KGB, then handed over to the 
Committee's successor, the Russian Ministry of Security, then 
again are made into a separate structure. From your point of 
view as a person who served in the Troops for almost 30 years, 
to what extent was their independent existence, or to the 
contrary, their existence within the framework of a particular 
department, justified? 
  [Agapov] The Border Troops should be 
independent--this is my profound conviction. It stands to reason 
that they must be in constant contact with services providing 
state security, with customs officials, and also with various 
ministries and departments such as the ministries of Defense, 
Internal Affairs, Finance, and Economy, and with the Foreign 
Intelligence Service. But only on an independent basis, 
otherwise the Troops lose their appearance and their 
professionalism, taking on in their place the coloration and 
ideology of the department to which they are assigned. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And from the very beginning, from 
the moment they were established, did the Border Troops exist 
independently or were they on someone's "leash"? 
  [Agapov] When the Russian Federation Border Guard 
was established after the Revolution (the Decree establishing it 
was signed by Lenin on 28 May 1918), where didn't they try to 
drag this Guard! Into the Ministry of Finance and into some kind 
of other departments, but nothing worthwhile came of this. And 
because the primary mission of the Border Troops is to provide 
state security on the border, in the final account they ended up 
in that department which also engaged in providing security--on 
the scale of the entire country. And they fully took root in 
this system of OGPU-NKVD-MGB-KGB. They took root, I do not wish 
to hide this. 
  But as I said, in performing certain common functions 
together with security organs, the Troops unfortunately also 
assumed other functions alien to them, such as pure 
counterintelligence connected with internal problems. And some 
subunits even engaged in the "fifth line," the fight against 
ideological subversion--true, only in the border zone. Of 
course, Border Troops personnel did not carry on developments 
independently, but they collected information that was out of 
the ordinary and passed it on to where it was supposed to go. 
  By the way, here is one more argument of no small importance 
in favor of independence. Information which Border Troops 
personnel have is unique in its way: They observe the 
development of a situation on border territory--their own and 
the enemy's. But when Border Troops were part of state security 
organs, their information did not go to the country's leadership 
directly. It first went "topside," to the KGB, where it was 
processed, fitted, and sorted in a suitable manner, and the real 
picture thus was distorted substantially. 
  Generally there were many different slants. One time, for 
example, an idea was hanging around (although not carried out, 
it still hangs around) about subordinating the Border Troops to 
the Ministry of Defense, or about their organizational 
development according to the type of one of the branches of the 
Armed Forces. 
  What also contributed to this was the fact that, to their 
misfortune, Border Troops personnel were deprived of their own 
institute where professionals--staffers, organizers of border 
security, operations personnel--were trained. That is why at one 
time Border Troops personnel were trained at the Frunze Academy. 
This ended with us losing specialists in 30 years of such 
practice. It would turn out that on completing the Border Troops 
school and serving on the border 5-6 years, an officer would get 
to the Academy, pick up a "militaristic" intoxication, and then 
think only in categories of division, corps, army, front. And 
our troops were slanted toward the Army... True, this later was 
corrected, a Border Troops faculty was established right there 
in the Academy, and they provided Border Troops instructors. But 
still the spirit, way of life, and curriculum were close to that 
of the Army. At that time the thesis spread that the Border 
Troops not only should guard the border, but also defend it. 
Therefore, it was said, in case something happened Border Troops 
officers are obligated to be ready to command armies, corps and 
even fronts, although as a matter of fact this is absolutely 
unrealistic! The Border Troops are incapable of genuinely 
defending the border. There are border covering forces of ground 
troops for this. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Then just what should the Troops' 
activity boil down to? 
  [Agapov] It isn't necessary to reinvent the wheel. 
The functions of Border Troops are functions of exceptional 
importance: Controlling entry and exit and stopping the 
smuggling of drugs, weapons, ammunition and explosives. When I 
speak of illegal crossings, I naturally have in mind not some 
kind of idle persons, but the work of enemy special 
services--insertion of illegals/spies, saboteurs, and 
terrorists--although of course there have been other instances 
as well. For example, criminals avoiding justice often tried to 
flee from us. Some people fled in search of political asylum, 
and the very same also happened in the other direction. But 
purely agent insertions remained the important thing. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And to what extent did they bear 
a mass nature? 
  [Agapov] This path was used most actively after 
the Patriotic War. Subsequently other opportunities--technical 
reconnaissance, space reconnaissance--appeared, and 
well-adjusted technical information services began to arise. 
Later came the warming in relations between the Soviet Union and 
the West. Legal opportunities for obtaining information 
appeared. Superb conditions for collecting information were 
created on the territory of former Union states: they did not 
keep our secrets very well there. They acted according to the 
principle that someone else's secret is not my secret. In 
particular, Poland became such a fount of information about the 
Soviet Union's secrets; they were sold there right and left, 
wholesale and retail. So the need for a form of work such as 
agent insertion gradually began to disappear. But those states 
whose legal and technical capabilities were limited, China for 
example, continued to use the traditional method of inserting 
illegals. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] The border previously was built 
along the perimeter of all Soviet Union territory. How is it 
built today? 
  [Agapov] It is terrible to say this, but 
practically not at all. The old state border security system has 
collapsed and a new one has not been created. And as a result 
such breaches gape along the entire perimeter of Russia's 
borders today that it will take a minimum of 15-20 years to 
close them somehow. The shortsightedness of politicians and the 
striving to place their interests over state interests is at 
fault for everything. 
  When all this was being decided--the Union had disintegrated 
and the CIS had arisen--there was a group of people in the 
Border Troops leadership (including me) who said: "Stop and 
think better of it!" We insisted that we need to preserve a 
unified border space and ensure a smooth flow of Union Border 
Troops into CIS Border Troops, and this opinion found support up 
to a certain point. Appropriate agreements were signed and a 
CinC CIS Border Troops was appointed--Colonel General Ilya 
Yakovlevich Kalinichenko. 
  Then everything fell apart. There were too many who wanted 
to 
become commanders of their own Border Troops--Ukrainian, Uzbek, 
Kazakh, Russian and God knows what others. The presence of 
statehood presumes the presence of borders, they said. The fact 
is, already then it was understandable that not one former Union 
republic was capable of ensuring the independent security of its 
borders on a purely economic and financial basis. The result is 
gigantic breaches on all axes: On the Central 
Asiatic--Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and 
Turkmenia; in the Transcaucasus--Azerbaijan, Armenia and 
Georgia; and although the border is guarded in Ukraine and 
Belarus, it is far from as it was before. 
  Only a few sectors of the "old" border--built up and with 
adjusted duty--were preserved: The borders with Norway, Finland, 
China and Mongolia. These sectors are more or less closed, but 
the rest... The system was established for over 70 years, bit by 
bit. Necessary engineer works, obstacles, observation posts, 
border zastavas, posts and detachments were built. All this was 
smoothed out and settled. They knew where to send details and 
where, how, and what to secure in each kilometer. But everything 
was pulled down in an instant. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And how effectively did the 
previous system operate? 
  [Agapov] Five or six unpunished border violations 
during the year were considered a major, inadmissible failure in 
the work of the Border Troops. There were serious "sortings 
out," stern measures were taken, and people were removed from 
the job. The chief of a border zastava could be discharged to 
the reserve unceremoniously for a penetration. And if the chief 
of a border detachment had a minimum of two penetrations on his 
record, that was it; his service ended on that. So only 
irreproachable, hard-working organizers of border service who 
did not reserve for themselves the right of failure advanced in 
service. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And now? 
  [Agapov] Now the penetration count has gone over 
the thousands. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] What sectors of the border 
traditionally were considered the most troublesome? 
  [Agapov] The Transcaucasus was considered the most 
difficult and crucial sector of operation, difficult even for 
purely geographical reasons: The Soviet population and the 
population across the border were in maximum proximity to each 
other, a matter of meters. You understand that it is one thing 
when there is a 30-40 km border strip from the main line of 
engineer works to the state border and it is quite another 
matter when it is 5-6 meters. There are more urges for contacts, 
illegal crossings, relations, illegal transactions and so on. It 
is there in the Transcaucasus, on the border with Turkey and 
Iran, that Border Troops personnel forged their expertise. 
  True, with respect to looking after the border, another 
troublesome sector was considered to be the Norwegian and the 
Baltic. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] You say that the old border 
security system has collapsed today. What does this threaten for 
the country's security? 
  [Agapov] There is a constant movement of weapons, 
ammunition and drugs across the border. Into whose hands will 
all this fall? That's the whole point! The criminal situation in 
Russia today is fraught with the most unpredictable 
consequences. Terrorism of all stripes and all directions is 
flourishing. Add to this the overall political instability. 
  Some kind of feverish, helpless attempts are being made to 
change the situation, but in vain. The conditions in which the 
Troops find themselves are such that they cannot cope with this 
task. They are incapable of providing reliable security for 
Russia's state borders. In addition, Russian Border Troops 
personnel today have to perform duty on the border of third 
countries. Russian Border Troops are securing the border of 
Tajikistan with Afghanistan, Georgia with Turkey, and Armenia 
with Turkey. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But is this justified? 
  [Agapov] It is justified only because otherwise 
these borders will not be secured at all. Where is the 
absurdity? We do not have our own borders with these 
states--they are "transparent"--and so we have to secure their 
borders to prevent illegal movements across their territories 
onto Russian territory. Some generally believe that we must get 
out of there, post troops along Russia's present perimeter, and 
that's it. But this is precluded; ready-made positions and the 
old structure have remained on the former Union border. It is 
cracking and falling apart, but it still can be used. But to 
begin from scratch... This will take 15-20 years, not to mention 
the material and financial costs, which are completely beyond 
our capability now. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And what is the solution? 
  [Agapov] Only a common border. Heads of CIS member 
states must sit down at the negotiating table... 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But if we take into account that 
rivers of weapons and drugs are constantly flowing across 
uncovered borders, as you yourself say, and all this is being 
turned into enormous amounts of money... The fact is, this is 
very, very profitable for someone. Consequently, big problems 
may arise with the establishment of combined Border 
Troops... 
  [Agapov] Naturally, and this is why we must set 
the most rigid conditions today for those states from which this 
flow is coming. Steps must be taken to bring them to their 
senses. Say to them: "Brothers, either you properly close your 
border or we will have a stern talk with you." 
  Or just what do we have? I recently met with the commander 
of 
the North Caucasus Border District. So? He recently conducted a 
troop operation on the border between Dagestan and Azerbaijan. 
They confiscated around five billion rubles and detained 60 
persons from who knows what countries and of who knows what 
nationalities, who penetrated into Azerbaijan, then tried to 
travel into Russia, and the other way around. But for this it 
was necessary to mobilize practically all district forces, and 
this for a one-time action, in order to close--for a 
time(!)--only a small sector of the border. 
  But this probably is not even the most terrible thing--not 
perforated borders or material disorder. The impression of what 
a Border Troops person is has been eroded and the previous 
spirit of these Troops has been lost. Previously in securing the 
border a Border Troops person secured the entire Soviet people, 
the whole country, and he was proud of this. But today the 
Border Troops person is a mercenary. He was ordered: "Go God 
knows where and secure God knows what." Secure what? On what 
grounds? Therefore, as with any person forced to do something, 
he does not guard, but simulates guarding. I am speaking about 
the officer. And what can be said about the soldier? Does he 
have a great need for the Georgian or Azerbaijani border so as 
to put his life on the line for who knows what? 
  Honestly speaking, when the USSR Border Troops were 
eliminated, many of us found ourselves in a very difficult 
situation. The question arose: Into which troops should we go 
serve--Ukrainian, Georgian, Russian, Kazakh, Moldovan or perhaps 
Belarusian? It was necessary to choose. But I--and not just I 
alone--served in the Border Troops for 30 years and guarded the 
safety of the Moldovan and Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian, 
Bashkir and Jew to an equal extent. It was all one for me. And 
so to go guard the border of some one republic... And I made my 
choice--I left the Troops. And I know many did the very same. 
But... Some received an apartment, some did not serve to 
retirement. And those who already had all this, or the young 
ones who had to serve 15-20 years until retirement, left. Now 
the "old-timers" will serve to retirement and also will leave. 
And again there will be a collapse. A collapse on a collapse.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina under the heading "Contacts": </F>
"The Border as a Region of Cooperation: That Is What the Border 
Guards of Russia and China Want"] 
  [Text] Local Russian contacts between border guard 
districts and military and border guard structures in the 
People's Republic of China regarding protection of the state 
border, underway for several years already, now require the 
involvement of central ministries. Resolution of the political 
and professional matters that have arisen in the process of 
establishing a system for protection of the state border was the 
subject of an initial visit by a delegation of senior members of 
the General Staff (the agency which, together with the PRC 
Ministry of Public Security, deals with border protection 
matters) to Moscow, where talks are underway with the Russian 
Federal Border Guard Service. 
  At a joint press conference held at the conclusion of the 
first stage of the Russo-Chinese talks, Col. Gen. Andrey 
Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of border guards and head of the 
Russian Federation Federal Border Guard Service, and Maj. Gen. 
Kui Fulin, assistant chief of the General Staff, Chinese 
People's Liberation Army, were unanimous in the opinion that 
"the borders between the great countries of Russia and China 
must become a region of peace and cooperation." In order to make 
that wish a reality it will be necessary to sign bilateral 
agreements at the level of border guard agencies and 
governmental structures in both states (primarily at issue is 
protection of the eastern sector of the Russian border and the 
Kirghiz and Tajik sectors of the CIS border). The Russian side, 
according to Col. Gen. Nikolayev, is prepared to present its 
packet of proposals during a visit to China by Russian head of 
government Chernomyrdin. The Chinese delegation, elaborately 
noting the "great amount of time required for documents to move 
through official agencies in China" is not at all inclined to 
link its efforts with that high-level guest's visit to China. 
  The main focus of concern for border guard administrations 
in 
both states should be the establishment of a "civilized" border 
guard regime along the so-called first and second lines, i.e. at 
the border crossing level, with the number of crossing points 
commensurate to the region's economic needs. Consideration 
should also be given to professional contacts between Russian 
and Chinese border guard structures in the Russian Federation's 
Pacific, Far Eastern and Transbaikal border guard districts and 
China's corresponding border guard provinces with regard to 
interdiction of violations of the state border, for the purpose 
of combatting organized crime in both countries. 
  In the opinion of Andrey Nikolayev the negotiations on 
reduction of arms and armed forces and on confidence-building 
measures and demarcation work along the Chinese-Russian border 
that are being conducted between diplomatic ministries in the 
Russian Federation and the PRC attest to the normal relations 
between our countries, and Russia's border guards are prepared 
to reinforce and expand those diplomatic successes. It did not 
seem that their Chinese colleagues had any objection to doing 
so, either.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leche Tepsurkayev, chief of Counternarcotics </F>
Division of Sakhalin Oblast Internal Affairs Administration, by 
Oleg Demakov; date and place not given: "The Sakhalin Drug 
Trade: Dealers and Victims"] 
  [Text] In 1993 there were 158 cases in the oblast in 
which people were charged with drug trafficking and drug 
possession, and more than 200 kilograms of drugs were 
confiscated. In 1992 there were only 70 such trials and only 68 
kilograms of confiscated drugs. 
  We were motivated to begin looking into the problem of drug 
abuse not only by the sinister statistics, but also by our 
personal observations. Young men and women who are clearly under 
the influence of drugs are a common sight on our streets. 
Conversations in which drug terms, such as "joint," 
"freebasing," "mainlining," and "lid," are commonly used are not 
extraordinary either. 
  Finally, the sight of teenagers openly rolling a "joint" on 
the steps of the Oktyabr movie theater provided the conclusive 
evidence that the weakness for drugs has become the genuine 
scourge of a whole generation. 
  A SVOBODNYY SAKHALIN correspondent interviewed the main 
enemy 
of the Sakhalin drug mafia, Leche Tepsurkayev, the chief of the 
Counternarcotics Division of the oblast Internal Affairs 
Administration. 
  [Tepsurkayev] One of the problems of drug abuse in Russia is 
the absence of legislation allowing us to take any action 
against, for example, those teenagers at the theater. The law 
stating that criminal proceedings would be instituted against 
any person caught using drugs twice in one year has been 
repealed. For this reason, the drug user no longer has anything 
to fear. 
  [Demakov] Would you say that most of the drugs on Sakhalin 
are not produced locally? 
  [Tepsurkayev] They definitely are not. They enter the oblast 
through a multitude of channels. They usually come through 
Central Asia (opium from Afghanistan comes through Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan), and poppy straw comes 
here from Ukraine. The principal and most dangerous supplier, 
however, is Maritime Kray, the source of the marijuana. There 
are drugs from Vietnam, China, and North Korea. There are 
channels through which drugs and guns are shipped from Sakhalin 
to Japan.... 
  [Demakov] This is especially true now that the drug trade 
generates profits of up to 1,000 percent for the criminals. Is 
your division capable of keeping an eye on all of the known 
channels? 
  [Tepsurkayev] We can monitor them, but the legislative base 
is constantly letting us down. The only grounds for the 
institution of criminal proceedings are complaints from citizens 
or organizations, and we are not getting any. 
  The only way we can put a dealer on trial is to catch him in 
the act. Even when we do this, however, any defense attorney can 
use a number of tricks to prove that our actions were illegal. 
  [Demakov] Although literally everyone, including that 
defense 
attorney, knows that this is a real criminal.... 
  [Tepsurkayev] Of course. That is why we receive offers of 
help from representatives of the former Russian Federation 
Ministry of Security, the heads of the Internal Affairs 
Administration, and the oblast administration. 
  Back in 1987 the Supreme Soviet published an edict 
authorizing each administration to institute drug control. Our 
administration exercised this right, which allowed us to 
question suspects without any delays. Today this might be the 
only way of taking any kind of firm action while staying within 
the law. 
  [Demakov] Who is your typical "client"? 
  [Tepsurkayev] The drug trade is an international business, 
and that is why anyone at all might be involved in it. In most 
cases, however, they are adults who can afford to come up with 
the large initial investment. This kind of "client," even if he 
is put on trial, rarely pays for his own crimes. He always has 
the prospect of buying his way out of the problem by hiring a 
good defense attorney.... Furthermore, this kind of criminal is 
quite difficult to convict, because all of the work is done by 
those young people we were talking about, and they are the ones 
who do the time in prison. 
  Another problem is the tendency of illegal drugs to become a 
consolidating factor for young users, uniting the addicts in an 
extended organization. They know each other and are in contact 
with each other.... 
  Unfortunately, the percentage of crimes committed by addicts 
is constantly rising: Strong drugs cost so much that it is 
simply impossible to earn this much money legally. A single gram 
of opium, for example, or a cup of poppy straw can cost from 
25,000 to 30,000 rubles. Marijuana costs the same. 
  [Demakov] And in this community, in addition to the "common 
needles" the drug abusers share, they also have "common causes": 
They join forces in "bombing" homes and stripping passersby of 
their clothes and shoes.... 
  [Tepsurkayev] That is true, and it is frightening. That is 
why we urge them and their parents to come to us before it is 
too late. Your children will not necessarily be put on trial, 
and your statements can give us the grounds to prosecute those 
who are poisoning your family members. The telephone number of 
our division is 2-39-71.

<F P=106> [Interview with B. Mizrakhi, deputy head of administration </F>
of Chelyabinsk Oblast, by Ye. Frantseva; place and date not 
given: "B. Mizrakhi: `Everything Must Be Done To Bring Creative 
People to the Duma...'"] 
  [Text] Work on the statutes concerning the oblast 
Duma and procedure for election to it has been completed. 
Confirmed by the oblast head of administration, the statutes 
have acquired the force of local law according to which we will 
henceforth be guided. The heated discussion and debate is behind 
us... 
  Working in the oblast administration on the election 
documents during their final stage of preparation was deputy 
oblast administration head B. Mizrakhi. 
  [Frantseva] Boris Aleksandrovich, how did the work go with 
regard to the statute on the oblast Duma and statute on the 
election of its deputies? Were these efforts equally complex? 
  [Mizrakhi] It took longer to draw up the Statute on the 
oblast Duma--we started working on it sooner and it was 
confirmed later. It elicited a great many more disputes. The 
statute on elections went smoother. The fact is--here we had 
very detailed instructions from the Central Electoral Committee. 
Essentially, 90 percent of the statute was finished. But 
fundamental parameters were not indicated in the documents we 
had to use for guidance in developing the statute on the oblast 
organ of legislative authority. The numerical strength of the 
body, for example. Just principles were presented, and arguing 
over principles is more complicated. Perhaps it was easier, 
therefore, to reach accord between entirely diverse parties and 
movements developing their own draft parallel to the 
administration effort. 
  It must be said that the edicts of the Russian president 
that 
were issued one after another concerning structures of power in 
krays and oblasts--coming out in November, December, and 
January--also left their mark on the process of preparing the 
document on the Duma itself. They complicated our work. Edict 
No. 2266, for example, significantly narrowed the provisions of 
the Russian Federation Law "On the Kray and Oblast Soviet, Kray 
and Oblast Administration." Specifically, the provision 
disappeared according to which it was possible for the oblast 
organ of representational authority to express a lack of 
confidence in the head of administration. Like other aspects, 
this factor had to be taken into account in drawing up the 
statute on the Duma. 
  [Frantseva] Well, what articles in the statutes on elections 
and on the Duma itself caused the most difficulties? What 
elicited the greatest argument in drawing up the documents? 
  [Mizrakhi] The most problematic was probably the question of 
principles for nominating candidates. What system should be used 
in the election--majority-based or mixed? Or a proportional 
system only, i.e., by party slates? The latter prospect was 
rejected immediately. But the mixed system, the system used for 
elections to the State Duma, had quite a number of supporters. 
  Guiding documents from the center recommended a 
majority-based system--by single-seat districts. A mixed system 
was also permitted, but on an experimental basis. We decided on 
an election by single-seat districts. I am personally convinced 
that under today's conditions a mixed system is not suitable for 
the oblast. The parties that are represented in our oblast have 
from 50 to 200 members. Can they represent the interests of 
large enough groups of voters? Of course not! The 
representatives of parties and movements agreed during the final 
stage of work on the draft that ordinary elections--by 
single-seat districts, would be appropriate today all the same 
for the oblast. 
  There was disagreement as to how many signatures a candidate 
for the oblast Duma should have to collect in his own support in 
order to be registered. There were a great many proposals. 
Agreement was reached that for the initial stage, no less than 4 
percent of the total number of voters in the district had to 
support a candidate. 
  [Frantseva] After the full oblast soviet, a Duma of 15 
deputies is unusual. Why was it decided to have precisely this 
number of deputies in the oblast's representative organ of power? 
  [Mizrakhi] Well, this too was one of the issues discussed to 
a fairly great extent. There has been a strong trend in recent 
times towards reducing the number of deputies in 
representational organs of authority at all levels. But the 
presidential edict provided us the opportunity to decide on the 
Duma and on 50 deputies. We were interested in seeing what 
decision was reached in other regions where elections had 
already taken place. There was a great spread. In Moscow a Duma 
of 35 deputies was elected, in Leningrad Oblast--of 20 deputies, 
in Kurgan Oblast--25. While in Vologda, Kostroma, and Tambov 
Oblasts, there were 15 deputies, and in Kamchatka--16. 
  We had proposals to elect 17 and 19 deputies to the Duma. 
This question was examined very closely with the need to divide 
the oblast into an appropriate number of electoral districts of 
approximately equal value. We decided upon the figure 15 as a 
result. All the same, I do not think the number is the most 
important thing--this is not what will determine the 
effectiveness of the representational authority. Everything will 
be decided by which deputies we elect, on how prepared they turn 
out to be for work in the Duma and how responsible they are. We 
must do everything we can to see to it that the Duma assembles 
true creators, people who favor specific deeds over words, who 
enjoy the confidence of the people and have a rich experience of 
organizational and administrative work. There are such people in 
the oblast. 
  [Frantseva] What public proposals, including those of 
parties 
and movements, were taken into account in the final version of 
the statute on the Duma? 
  [Mizrakhi] Articles were included providing for the Duma to 
adopt oblast regulations and amend them. The Duma's right to 
legislative initiative was not originally secured in the draft. 
This was corrected. Also taken into account was the general 
opinion concerning incompatibility of the status of deputy with 
an official position or activity in state or other organs. A 
provision was proposed and inserted into the final version of 
the document to the effect that a candidate for deputy of the 
oblast Duma need not reside in the territory of the electoral 
district for which seat he is campaigning. 
  [Frantseva] It is not infrequently today that we hear it 
said 
that the executive authority is creating "under itself" a 
representational authority in the oblast. And has even invented 
a name for it... 
  [Mizrakhi] Well, the Duma can change its name. It is its 
prerogative, as I have already stated, to adopt the oblast 
regulations and amend them. Should the deputies consider it 
advisable to introduce amendments to the statute on elections to 
the Duma, they have the right to do so. By edict of the 
president, the administration was charged with the 
responsibility of setting elections to a new organ of 
representational authority and this is what it did, just as 
executive organs of authority have done in other krays and 
oblasts. I have stated many times and wish to repeat here that 
when you have a situation where one branch of power exists 
without another, that is an abnormal situation. We need a 
balance of power. 
  [Frantseva] But why has the election been put off for such a 
long time--not set for March, as stipulated by presidential 
edict, and not even for April, but for mid-May? And now it has 
been proposed, as we recall, for June? 
  [Mizrakhi] The right to make a definitive decision here 
belongs to the head of the administration. I do not conceal the 
fact that opinions diverged on this account even within the 
administration itself. I am one who worked in favor of the 
election being held at an earlier time frame. But today, now 
that the decision has been made, there is no place for argument 
in my view. We must focus attention on preparations for the 
election. Especially since the Central Electoral Commission has 
postponed the election of deputies to the Council of the 
Federation for our oblast to 15 May. 
  [Frantseva] Boris Aleksandrovich, the overwhelming majority 
of participants in meetings with presidential representative V. 
Seleznev, as well as members of the working group preparing 
draft documents on the oblast Duma and elections to it, were 
from the communist and national-patriotic parties and movements. 
It is difficult to believe that the leaders of democratic 
organizations were not invited to take part in these 
discussions... 
  [Mizrakhi] Unfortunately, their activity level was truly 
low. 
The administration received proposals from only a few 
democratically oriented parties and movements. Their absence 
from meetings held by V. Seleznev, meetings I participated in, 
even provided a pretext for accusing me of abandoning democratic 
principles. Not true! It is simply that those whose views I 
share failed to show the level of interest in drawing up 
documents on the election which was exhibited by their 
opponents. I did everything I could under my control. I engaged 
in consultations, met with V. Kislitsin representing the Russian 
Movement for Democratic Reforms, with N. Shchapin of the 
Republican Party, and others. As a member of the executive 
committee of Russia's Choice, I have fought and continue to 
fight without reservation for democratic principles. 
  Without a doubt, democratic forces in the oblast must work 
today to quickly surmount disunity. They must join forces. I 
have great expectations of the recently established bloc Accord, 
which unites adherents of reforms, including Russia's Choice. I 
would like to believe that the efforts of this electoral bloc 
during the election campaign will prove highly productive. [end 
Mizrakhi] 
  This interview was conducted the end of last week, prior to 
B. Mizrakhi's trip to Moscow where he participated in a 
conference of the Social Chamber of the Russian Federation 
president. Upon his return, B. Mizrakhi stated that the 
conference was dedicated to elections of representational organs 
of authority of Federation entities and elections of organs of 
local self-government. Results of the elections were analyzed at 
the locations where the elections were held. In some cases these 
results are disturbing, it was noted at the conference. Serious 
violations were uncovered with respect to the conduct of the 
election in a number of regions. In certain oblasts, the 
majority of deputy seats went to opponents of the president. 
Great differences were noted in the election provisions of 
organs of local self-government. A desire was expressed in this 
regard reflecting the advisability of forming organs of local 
self-government following the adoption of the appropriate 
federal law. Conference participants also expressed support for 
postponing the elections of representational authority in 
Federation entities until June. Thus, the election in our oblast 
is not an exception, but rather falls under the general trend. 
Incidentally, the Central Electoral Committee today noted the 
carefulness of preparations for the election in our oblast, 
considering it greater than that exercised in many other oblasts.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Alyabyeva, under rubric "Politics": "LDPR: </F>
Local Version"] 
  [Text] Many Chelyabinsk residents recalled the visit made 
to our city in July 1991 by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who at that 
time was pretender to the country's highest job -- the job of 
president. The city dwellers, who for the most part leaned 
"toward Yeltsin," met the candidate cautiously. At the ChTZ 
[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant], where the meeting was held at an 
open area near the main entrance, people were openly unfriendly. 
In front of the rostrum from which the guest was speaking there 
was active counteragitation. People went up and down the rows, 
passing out a newspaper in which a well-known deputy of the 
Russian parliament of the time had asserted that "Zhirinovskiy's 
party is a bluff"... 
  But then one observed the complete manifestation of Vladimir 
Volfovich's mastery at recruiting supporters for himself. He 
unerringly guessed what it was specifically that the audience 
was expecting from the visiting politician, and he formulated 
its hopes as clear and specific goals that he and his party were 
undertaking to achieve. The result? After the meeting, 
Zhirinovskiy was surrounded by a dense crowd. People stretched 
their hands out to him. People asked him for his autograph. And 
they asked: how do we get into your party? Many were ready to 
write an application on the spot... I myself was a witness to 
all of this. 
  But no party cell was born in Chelyabinsk at that time. Nor 
did it exist a year later. For all the variety of the political 
palette of the oblast center, for a long time we did not have 
any organized liberal democrats. Following the first party 
congress, there were three more. Its managerial link, with its 
permanent leader, underwent ideological demarcations. Party 
rules were banned and were newly registered. And all of this was 
without people from Chelyabinsk. 
  The "seeds sprouted" in the summer of 1993. And I think that 
that was not accidental. The fourth LDPR congress was held in 
the spring. Zhirinovskiy formulated his party's goal as follows: 
"In a year and a half we will be in power." Without regional 
support that goal obviously is unfeasible. That is why, it would 
seem, in addition to the fixed attention that the LDPR is paying 
to each specific category of Russians, an increased amount of 
interest is being shown to the territories. If not material 
support, the maximum amount of moral support is being given to 
party members here. 
  Well, then, what about the Chelyabinsk organization? Who 
among us has gone farther in following Zhirinovskiy's slogans 
and has become part of his "hawkish" organization? 
  The best-known person is the leader of the local 
"Zhirinovskiyites," Aleksey Yalovenko, a 43-year-old 
entrepreneur with two higher educations, who has "knocked about 
a bit" in production (Polet [Flight], the ChTZ), and who has 
worked as an economist. In the autumn he fought for the mandate 
of deputy to the State Duma in the Kalinin Electoral District. 
In the list of candidates to that Duma from the LDPR, he was No. 
136. He was insulted when, in a newspaper report, I equated that 
place with the real rating of the Chelyabinsk organization in 
the party. 
  When we were "ascertaining the relations" in the okrug 
electoral commission, I asked Aleksey Yalovenko a question: was 
he really counting of victory in that election? And the answer I 
heard was: no, but their organization intended to make active 
use of the campaign that had developed. They intended to use it 
for propaganda and agitation work to benefit the LDPR and its 
leader, Zhirinovskiy, as well as the local party organization. 
  Properly speaking, it was for that reason that his personal 
agitational campaign was extremely modest against the background 
of all the others. 
  (Incidentally, not many people know that something that was 
supposed at that time to become a powerful reinforcement of the 
young Chelyabinsk organization and its leader was a new 
pre-election visit to the city by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The day 
had already been set, and the auditorium for the meeting had 
already been leased, but the party leader's plans changed...) 
  However, having given in the newspaper an announcement about 
his party and his telephone numbers, Aleksey Fedorovich admits 
that it a rare day or evening (he took the risk of giving his 
home telephone number) that passes without having someone call 
him. And they really say vile, insulting things to him. But, 
according to him, the people who call most frequently are those 
who share the LDPR slogans and who like Vladimir Volfovich's 
appeals. 
  Well, then, what are we told by the results of the 
elections, 
of which we have actually had quite a few. Of those who chose 
slogans which, as early as the period of the pre-election 
campaign, were unambiguously branded as fascist ones. True, 
after the leader of Russia's Choice was summoned to the Court of 
Arbitration, comparisons of Zhirinovskiy with Hitler began to be 
published more cautiously, and historical parallels with the 
Weimar Republic proved to be more productive. But the ferocity 
of the time frames proved in this situation to be more 
beneficial for "Zhirinovskiy's party"... 
  The election ended, the Duma began working, and on the basis 
of the mail and telephone calls to the editorial office one can 
judge that interest toward the LDPR, including the interest on 
the part of our fellow citizens, has not abated. So we decided 
to took a good look at the local version of the liberal 
democrats. With A. Yalovenko's permission I visited one of the 
meetings of the Chelyabinsk LDPR organization. 
  What was immediately apparent, and even strikingly so, was 
the discipline. Discipline like that could definitely not have 
been encountered at every meeting of the CPSU with its 
democratic centralism. Who was absent, for what reason, who had 
failed to give notification, a rechecking of the list... There 
were twice as many cell members as had gathered that day in the 
recreation room of the ZhEK [housing operation office]. It 
turned out that, because of the crowding, it was impossible for 
everyone to fit into the one area at the same hour -- it was 
necessary to hold the meeting in two sessions. 
  A. Yalovenko began to discuss his trip to Moscow, to the 
party's Central Committee, and I looked around at those who had 
gathered, among whom, incidentally, the roll call had revealed 
two newcomers, who had come here for the first time with the 
intention of becoming LDPR members. The overwhelming majority of 
the audience consisted of men, mostly between the age of 30 and 
40. It turned out later that the people were entrepreneurs, 
employees, and laborers. The people who were absent were those 
emotionally unbalanced individuals who had already become the 
usual participants in many meetings of other public 
organizations and parties. Evidently it was partially for that 
reason that the meeting proceeded in a businesslike, successful 
manner. 
  It was not until later, when I was standing at the bus stop, 
that I put all my impressions together. Yes, they had been 
people who had deliberately made their choice, who had come to 
the party in order to work and who were ready to work. They are 
the active opposition. Although I think that many of them, as 
members of the opposition, began with the usual grumbling about 
the messed-up production life, the production managers who had 
gotten out of control, the "stall businessmen" who were charging 
exorbitant prices... And the organization members themselves 
said at their meeting that people in the oblast had voted more 
eagerly for the LDPR in the areas of our industrial giants that 
periodically send their work on unpaid furloughs or with miserly 
payment for their forced days off. And I agree that these forced 
days off, to a large extent, are recruiting new LDPR members. 
And the headquarters of the local organization of that party in 
Chelyabinsk is not just anywhere, but in Traktorzavodskiy 
[Tractor Plant] Rayon: incidentally, Uraltrak has once again 
sent its tractor workers out on a two-week "furlough"... 
  To tell the truth, when I looked at those people and 
listened 
to their statements, I thought: somehow Zhirinovskiy's cocky 
statements -- those that assured the party the unflattering 
comparison with fascism -- do not "stick" specifically to them. 
For that reason I wanted to speak a bit with several party 
members, and after the meeting I had the opportunity to do so. 
  It was difficult to argue. But, for example, it seems to me 
that this is obvious: it is impossible to fit into a single 
program a promise to mothers that their sons will not serve 
outside the confines of Russia, that they will be returned from 
hot spots, and the obviously imperial vision of the future 
Russia -- as a minimum, the restoration of its borders as they 
were in 1917. But what about the "leap to the south," which even 
officially has been evaluated as an open appeal to war, for 
which a criminal case has been initiated against Zhirinovskiy? 
"Is it possible today to establish new boundaries without having 
Russian soldiers finding themselves in the role of conquerors?" 
I asked a woman who, it turned out, is a teacher who recently 
retired. The answer I heard was, "The point is not that the 
previous Russian territories will be won back, but that the 
economic conditions will force them to seek an alliance with 
Russia." "Well, then, what about the Russian soldier on the 
shore of the Indian Ocean, which has never washed Russia?" I 
asked her, giving an argument that, it would seem, is simply 
impossible to challenge. "What are you talking about!" the 
teacher said, giving me a surprised look. "That's simply an 
allegory!" 
  I assume that, when she is all alone, that elderly woman and 
teacher still experiences certain doubts about the 
convincingness of her logic. But I deliberately quote this 
dialogue, which convinced me that it is not very productive to 
put the label of "fascists" on people so scathingly and 
disdainfully. Incidentally, it is rather easy to be convinced 
that the association of local liberal democrats has been born 
and is definitely not sticking to the "geopolitical" strivings 
of their scandalously well-known leader. The thing that has 
united people and that is bringing new members to them is 
primarily people's deep concerns about the real-life situation, 
when enterprises are in a fever, when prices keep going higher 
and higher, when crime is rampant, and the ruling politicians 
try to convince people that this is the only possible course for 
the country. 
  There is nothing surprising about the fact that people who 
have lost their patience finally lose their hope of better times 
and are inclined easily to believe those who are decisive and 
energetic, who give simple recipes, infecting others with 
confidence about implementing them: "Just give me the power!" 
And when those decisive leaders mobilize that segment of our 
passive voters who, so far, have failed to trust either the 
creators of the present course or the opponents of that course, 
the power actually will easily prove to be in their hands. 
  The wing of Zhirinovskiy's popularity, of course, has 
overshadowed the LDPR organizations in the outlying areas. But 
here -- and, once again, I am making my conclusion from what I 
heard and saw at the meeting -- people are not planning to live 
for this world alone. And even A. Yalovenko's statement to his 
fellow party members sounds noticeably discordant: "Do not think 
that the party is meetings and high-sounding statements. Our 
party is serious. But do not expect any rapid success. It is a 
year or two until that success, and no less than that. But today 
we need planned, methodical work..." 
  It was precisely at that meeting that the first-priority 
tasks were discussed. One of them is the creation of a 
well-branched oblast organization. As of that moment, LDPR 
organizations were in operation in Zlatoust, Bakal, Troitsk, 
Miass, Sim, Magnitogorsk, and Kopeysk. In addition to 
Chelyabinsk. But there are also LDPR members in other cities, 
who entered the organization after addressing a statement 
directly to the Central Committee. The meeting planned to 
organize them also. And the task was posed not in general, but 
was assigned to a specific individual. 
  Another task that was broadly discussed is the creation of a 
youth organization. I really heard a lot about adolescents who 
had been kicked out of clubhouses where the areas had been 
handed over to other occupants! It would seem that the LDPR is 
the organization that has hands long enough to reach them! In 
any case there are people here who are ready to take that 
specific job on their shoulders... Just as, incidentally, they 
are ready to organize a volunteer people's druzhina 
("You can't fight crime with words; you have to help the 
militia!"). 
  Of course, the liberal democrats in Chelyabinsk intend to 
fight at the election to the local agencies of power. And they 
are seriously troubled by the equating of their party to a 
fascist organization. They have even decided to devote the next 
meeting to ideological questions, to analyze exactly what 
fascism is, and why people are accusing the LDPR of being 
fascist. They want to develop their own system of 
counterarguments. 
  Who knows, but maybe these reflections, if they prove to be 
as serious as the intention to improve Russian life, will yield 
an expected result... Will the Chelyabinsk LDPR organization 
then be able to further strengthen Zhirinovskiy's success? 
  Meanwhile, as has become known, Vladimir Volfovich himself 
intends to make a visit to Chelyabinsk.

<F P=106> [Edict: "Edict of the President of the Kabardino-Balkaria </F>
Republic [KBR] Concerning the Financing of State Expenses From 
the Republic Budget of the KBR in the First Quarter of 1994"] 
  [Text] For purposes of guaranteeing the uninterrupted 
financing of state expenses from the republic (KBR) budget, 
pending the adoption of the KBR Law entitled "The Budgetary 
System of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic For 1994," I decree: 
  1. The KBR Cabinet of Ministers is to carry out, in the 
first 
quarter of 1994, the financing of state expenses, proceeding 
from the expenditures that were established in the fourth 
quarter of 1993, with a consideration of increasing, effective 1 
December 1993, the minimum amount of payment of labor by a 
factor of 1.9 in conformity with Edict of the President of the 
Russian Federation [RF], dated 5 December 1993, No. 2115. 
  2. The following edicts are to be put into effect on the 
territory of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic: edicts of the 
President of the Russian Federation, dated 22 December 1993, No. 
2270, entitled "Certain Changes in Taxation and in the 
Interrelationships Among the Budgets at Various Levels," and 
dated 24 December 1993, No. 2292, entitled "The Making of 
Amendments and Additions to Edict of the President of the 
Russian Federation, dated 22 December 1993, No. 2270, entitled 
`Certain Changes in Taxation and in the Interrelationships Among 
the Budgets at Various Levels.'" 
  3. The following rates are to be established in the first 
quarter of 1994: 
  -- tax on property owned by enterprises: in the amount of 2 
percent of the taxable base; 
  -- profit tax to be entered in the budget of the 
Kabardino-Balkaria Republic: for banks and insurers, 30 percent; 
for enterprises and organizations, 22 percent. 
  KBR Ministry of Finance, jointly with the RF State Tax 
Inspectorate for Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, within the period 
of one month is to submit for review by the republic's Cabinet 
of Ministers and Parliament their recommendations for 
differentiating the rates for the profit tax. 
  4. The funds entered in the budgets of the republic's cities 
and rayons for regulated taxes and income are to be based on the 
standard amounts that were in effect in 1993. 
  5. KBR Ministry of Finance, in order to equalize the degree 
of social security for the population, is also to stipulate in 
the republic (KBR) budget of the cities and rayons, in the 
volumes planned for those purposes in the fourth quarter of 
1993, adjusted for the increase as of 1 December 1993 of the 
minimum size of the payment of labor by a factor of 1.9, the 
indebtedness of the republic (KBR) budget with regard to those 
expenses, which indebtedness had formed during 1993. 
  6. KBR Cabinet of Ministers and the heads of city and rayon 
administrations, by 1 March 1994, are to reduce the size of the 
apparatus in the agencies of state authority and administration 
and the expenses for maintaining them by no less than 20 percent.

with Edict of the President of the Russian Federation, dated 22 
December 1993, No. 2268, starting in the second quarters, in the

income of which is formed from mandatory payments by 
enterprises, institutions, and organizations, with the exception 
of the RF Pension Fund for KBR and the Kabardino-Balkaria 
Territorial Fund for Mandatory Medical Insurance, with the 
preservation of the specific directedness of the funds to be 
consolidated. 
  8. KBR Cabinet of Ministers, within the period of one month,

<F P=106> [Article by R. Kronik, under rubric "Extreme Situation": </F>
"But Our Television Center Is Operating"] 
  [Text] This is the first time that something like this has 
happened since the blue screens lighted up in our apartments. 
The Ostankino channel "went on strike," and one can understand 
the disappointment on the part of the television viewers who 
were unable on Thursday evening to see either the next segment 
of the movie "Simply Maria" or "Santa Barbara." 
  The RF [Russian Federation] Trade Union of Communications 
Workers carried out its threat against the government and the 
television companies that owed the communications enterprises 80 
billion rubles. 
  However, we were all pleasantly surprised when, after 
switching our television sets to Channel 11, we saw the local 
programs being transmitted. "How did you manage to do that?" we 
asked A. A. Bichoyev, chairman of the KBR State Television and 
Radio Company. 
  "Our State Television and Radio Company," he said, "is 
carried on the budget and is financed from Moscow by the Russian 
Television and Radio Administration. As a rule, we have a large 
amount of difficulty getting the money from there. Frequently 
there are delays in getting it. Back in December we were told 
not to hurry to settle accounts with the communications workers. 
We were told that, wherever they went, they would still be 
working. But we did not take that course of action. Instead, we 
attempted to settle accounts with the radio and television 
broadcasting center. Just a few days ago we paid off the last 
debt, and from now until the end of the month our program will 
operate in the usual mode." 
  "On Thursday you even surpassed it." 
  "Yes, we were sorry for the television viewers in our 
republic who were left without spiritual nourishment, and we 
found the opportunity to continue the program for one and a half 
hours. True, the movie that proved to be available was not one 
of the best, but we hope that it kept some of our young people 
in front of the screen, rather than wandering around aimlessly 
in the street." 
  "You mentioned centralized financing. But what does 
advertising provide?" 
  "We earn a miserly amount from it, unlike our associates in 
Rostov, Volgograd, Chelyabinsk, and a number of other cities. In 
our part of the country, unfortunately, many enterprises are 
standing idle, and there are not too many that want to advertise 
their products or services. We are taking the course of action 
of, so to speak, tightening our belts, rather than becoming 
debtors, since we realize that life is difficult for the RTPTs 
[Radio and Television Broadcasting Center] also. We have normal 
business relations with A. Khatsukov, who heads that center. We 
try to help each other to the best of our ability, so that our 
problems do not cause the television viewers and radio audience 
to suffer, as happened on 10 February in most regions of Russia."

<F P=106> [Article, under rubric "In the KBR Government": "Need for </F>
Preventive Work"] 
  [Text] In late January of this year the KBR 
[Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] Cabinet of Ministers considered 
the questions of measures to prevent infectious diseases on the 
territory of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic in 1994. 
  What did the Cabinet of Minister direct its attention to? 
Recently the work of preventing infectious and invasive diseases 
among human beings and animals has been conducted 
unsatisfactorily in the republic. In a number of populated 
places, as a result of the lack of a reliable accounting of the 
number of head of livestock that are being personally used by 
citizens, a large number of head of livestock remain 
unvaccinated against malignant anthrax and other infectious 
diseases, and animals are being slaughtered and their meat is 
being sold without veterinary inspection. Trade in meat and meat 
products is being carried out in unauthorized places. Frequently 
there is a lack of closed pavilions, and in the markets the 
sanitary condition is extremely unsatisfactory. This kind of 
situation creates a real threat to the arising of various 
infectious and invasive diseases of human beings and animals, 
which occurred in the village of Verkhniy Kurkuzhin, Baksanskiy 
Rayon. 
  What steps, then, have been taken? 
  For purposes of preserving the stable epidemiologic and 
epizootic situation, which precludes the arising of infectious 
and invasive diseases on the territory of the republic, the KBR 
Cabinet of Ministers, by its decree of 25 January 1994, No. 10, 
approved the Comprehensive Plan For Measures to Prevent 
Infectious and Invasive Diseases on the Territory of the KBR, 
and instructed the KBR Ministry of Finance to carry out the 
financing of the fulfillment of the program on the basis of the 
actual production expenditures being submitted by agencies of 
the Republic Center of the State Sanitation and Epidemiological 
Inspectorate and the republic's veterinary service. 
  The government directed the attention of the heads of the 
interested ministries and departments and the city and rayon 
administrations to the need to increase the efforts in the work 
of preventing infectious diseases on the territory of the 
republic. 
  To what specifically? 
  In particular, the heads of city and rayon administrations 
were instructed: 
  -- to establish in all populated places a strict accounting 
of the number of head of livestock in the individual use of 
citizens; 
  -- to organize the building of livestock burial grounds, 
corrals for the veterinary processing of animals, slaughter 
areas, and closed pavilions for the trading of meat and meat 
products in populated places; and to render assistance to the 
republic's veterinary service in organizing the carrying out of 
veterinary measures. 
  KBR Ministry of Agriculture and Food Products (A. T. 
Kushkhov) has been required: to tighten up the monitoring of the 
work of the veterinary service and to require the strict 
execution of antiepizootic measures by the established 
deadlines; and to have a reserve supply of the necessary amount 
of biological preparations, disinfectants, and diagnostic means 
to take steps in the event that emergency situations arise. 
  KBR Ministry of Public Health (M. L. Berov) and KB 
[Kabardino-Balkaria] Center of the State Sanitation and 
Epidemiological Inspectorate (A. A. Kyagov) are to assure the 
carrying out, on the entire territory of the republic, of a 
series of treatment-and-prevention and antiepidemic measures to 
prevent infectious diseases. 
  The government has demanded of the KBR Ministry of Internal 
Affairs (Kh. A. Shogenov), the KB Center of the State Sanitation 
and Epidemiological Inspectorate (A. A. Kyagov), the KBR 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Products (A. T. Kushkhov), and 
the administration heads in the republic's cities and rayons 
that they tighten up the inspection of the sanitary state of the 
populated places and the places where agricultural products are 
being sold, and that they hold strictly accountable the 
violators of the trade procedures and sanitation requirements. 
Moreover, KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs is required to 
tighten up the monitoring of the shipments of animals on the 
republic's motor roads. 
  Similar instructions have been issued to the 
Kabardino-Balkaria Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, 
which must guarantee the allocation of air time to the 
veterinary and sanitation-antiepidemic services so that 
specialists can speak on measures to prevent diseases among 
humans and animals. 
  An undisputed amount of interest is also being shown in the 
Comprehensive Program. It stipulates the execution of a number 
of important measures. They include organizational measures, 
veterinary-sanitation measures, treatment and prevention 
measures, sanitation and antiepidemic measures... Their 
implementation, to a large degree, will help to resolve this 
very complicated problem, which is taking hundreds and thousands 
of people away from creative labor.

<F P=106> [Report of Maritime Kray Statistics Administration: "The </F>
Kray Is Actually Making the Move to Market Relations; the 
Socioeconomic Status of Maritime Kray in 1993"] 
  [Text] The results of 1993 indicate that the economy was 
not stabilized in Maritime Kray and that the economic reforms 
are running into difficulty. One thing is absolutely certain, 
however: The kray is actually making the move to market 
relations. 
  The number of enterprises is rising. By the end of the year 
there were already more than 31,000. More than 10,000 are 
private or individual enterprises, and 17,000 are joint-stock 
companies, partnerships, and public organizations. 
  The private and mixed forms of ownership extended to almost 
one-fourth of all large and medium-sized industrial enterprises. 
They produced 16 percent of the whole industrial product, 86 
percent of the product of light industry, and 21 percent of the 
product of the food industry. During the year the commodity 
turnover of private enterprises rose from 5 percent of the total 
to 16 percent, and their share of paid services for the 
population rose from 6 to 10 percent. These entities performed 
38 percent of all of the construction and installation work of 
contracted construction organizations. 
  Price controls are virtually nonexistent. Prices are now 
influenced mainly by supply and demand. 
  The consumer market, which had been in ruins by the end of 
1991, was revived and is operating dynamically. The supply of 
goods in the market has increased substantially, although some 
prices are extremely high. The prerequisites have been 
established for a stock exchange and a securities market. 
  These positive processes, however, occurred at a time of 
severe crisis in the production sphere. The decrease in 
production volume was characteristic of all branches of the 
economy. 
  The following are indicators of the kray's socioeconomic 
status:

<H5>  Finances </H5>
  Profits in the kray in 1993 were estimated at 600 billion 
rubles, with an average monthly rate of increase of 178 percent, 
exceeding the rate of increase in prices. Industry accounted for 
more than 40 percent of all profits. 
  The value of enterprise income, however, was reduced 
perceptibly by rising prices. Around 24 percent of all the 
enterprises in the kray were operating at a loss in 1993. Most 
of them were in branches of the non-production sphere: around 60 
percent of the enterprises in housing and public utilities and 
consumer services, 25 percent in editing and publishing, and 
over 50 percent in culture and art. 
  The financial status of enterprises compounded the 
nonpayment 
crisis. The new wave of reciprocal indebtedness slowed down the 
flow of commodities and created difficulties in the acquisition 
of the necessary crude resources and materials and in the sale 
of finished products. 
  The overdue payments of industrial and agricultural 
enterprises and construction and transport organizations on 
debts to suppliers had reached 92 billion rubles by 1 December 
1993. 
  The amount had quadrupled since the beginning of the year 
just in industry and construction. Meanwhile, overdue payments 
by customers and clients amounted to 106 billion rubles by 1 
December 1993, representing 43 percent of the total purchaser 
debt. 
  Enterprises covered much of the shortage of financial 
resources with bank credit. The total amount of indebtedness for 
bank credit was 128 billion rubles on 1 December 1993, including 
60 billion rubles, or 47 percent, owed by state enterprises. 
  The absence of strict control in mutual settlements between 
enterprises and the budget is affecting their financial 
stability. The rate of solvency is low in nonferrous metallurgy, 
machine building, metalworking, and agriculture. 
  The indebtedness of enterprises to their own workers also 
continued to grow. The total on 1 January 1994 was 15 billion 
rubles (excluding transfers to workers' bank accounts), 
displaying a 19-fold increase since the beginning of the year. 
This increasing indebtedness is connected mainly with the 
shortage of funds in current accounts. 
  By the end of 1994 the amount of back pay owed to the 
workers 
of industrial enterprises was equivalent to 94 percent of the 
whole amount designated for the payment of wages to these 
workers during the month. The figure was 82 percent in 
construction and 87 percent in agriculture. 
  According to Finance Administration data, the kray budget 
deficit at the end of the first 11 months of 1993 was 16.5 
billion rubles. The main elements making up the deficit were 
uncollected profit tax--45 percent, value-added tax--20 percent, 
and income tax from physical persons--20 percent. A much small 
portion of the budget consists of revenue from privatization--3 
percent, excise tax--2 percent, property tax--1 percent, and 
state duties--0.5 percent. 
  Budget expenditures in January-November totaled 390.9 
billion 
rubles, with no significant changes in expenditure patterns. 
This included 170.6 billion rubles for the kray economy, 
representing 44 percent of all expenditures, 157.2 billion 
rubles for sociocultural measures (40 percent), and 10.8 billion 
rubles for the maintenance of state governing and administrative 
bodies and law enforcement agencies (3 percent). 
  According to Central Bank data, credited investments in the 
kray economy (excluding Savings Bank credits) totaled 517.9 
billion rubles on 1 January 1994--a figure 5.9 times as high as 
the figure for 1 January 1993. 
  Most of the credit extended was used for current economic 
needs rather than investment. The proportional amount of 
long-term credit decreased from 2.8 percent of the total at the 
beginning of the year to 1.5 percent at the end. Commercial 
banks extended virtually no long-term credit to enterprises 
because of the insufficient funds in enterprise current accounts. 
  According to Tax Inspectorate data, taxes and other 
obligatory payments amounted to 701.9 billion rubles on 1 
January 1994, including 245.3 billion rubles in payments to the 
federal budget and 456.6 billion to the local budget. 
  In addition to this, there were deposits of 68.9 billion 
rubles in extra-budgetary funds, including 35.1 billion rubles 
in highway funds, 500 million in environmental funds, 10 billion 
in the employment fund, and 23.3 billion in the medical 
insurance fund. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  By 1 January 1994, 921 enterprises in the kray had been 
privatized--641 of them in 1993. 
  Around 86 percent of the latter were sold to private owners 
and 14 percent underwent joint-stock conversion (complete or 
partial). 
  There were no significant changes in the sectorial structure 
of enterprises slated for privatization in the past year, but 
there were perceptible changes in their structure in terms of 
forms of ownership. The enterprises privatized in 1993 included 
federal property (7 percent) and territorial property (6 
percent), while the proportional amount of municipally owned 
plants and factories decreased slightly and amounted to 87 
percent. 
  "Small-scale" privatization generally took the form of sales 
with no governmental restrictions. Leased property with a 
buy-out option represented 16 percent of all privatized 
enterprises, 54 percent were privatized by means of commercial 
competitive bidding, and 15 percent were sold at auction. 
  The average transfer value of sold enterprises (the 
relationship between the sale price and the original price) in 
1993 was 46.6 percent: 61.6 percent for municipally owned 
enterprises, 3 percent for territorial property, and 2 percent 
for federal property. 
  The higher sale rate of municipally owned enterprises in the 
kray was due to their lower cost and consequent heightened 
accessibility to investors. These facilities usually do not 
require large investments after acquisition. 
  The privatization of large and medium-sized enterprises 
generally takes the form of stock issues. The second advantage 
option, allowing the labor collective to keep the controlling 
package of stock, is the preferred method. This option was 
chosen by 91 percent of the enterprises that became joint-stock 
companies. 
  Revenue from the privatization of enterprises (including 
funds received from enterprises privatized in 1992) amounted to 
over 21 billion rubles in currency and more than 202,000 
privatization checks. 
  The territorial budget received 68 percent of the currency, 
the federal budget received 21 percent, and other agencies 
received 11 percent. 
  During the year 129,700 apartments with a total area of 
6,135,200 square meters--47.3 square meters was the average 
apartment size (costing 86,000 rubles)--were privatized and 
became the personal property of citizens. 
  Since the beginning of the housing privatization process 
(1989), 173,000 apartments, or almost a third of all the 
apartments slated for privatization, have been sold to citizens 
or transferred to them without charge. 
<H5>  Liberalization of Prices </H5>
  The situation in the kray consumer market in 1993 
contributed 
to the escalation of inflationary processes. 
  The consumer price index, measuring inflation dynamics 
(excluding non-essentials), for all of 1993 was 1,161 percent of 
the December 1992 figure. 
  The rate of increase in the prices of goods and services 
declined during the year. The average monthly increase in 
consumer prices decreased from 28 percent in the first quarter 
to 19 percent in the fourth and reached its lowest level in 
December--14 percent. 
  Food prices were 10 times as high at the end of the year as 
at the beginning. The prices of meat, poultry, sausage, and fish 
products were more than 15 times as high, and the prices of 
eggs, flour, bread, and baked goods were 11-13 times as high. 
Food prices in urban markets were more than 10 times as high as 
in December 1992. The highest recorded increases were for dairy 
products--17 times--and farming products--9-13 times. 
  Vladivostok remained on the list of Russia's "expensive" 
cities all year. Most of the food prices here were 1.5-2 times 
as high as the Russian average. The prices of manufactured goods 
were 10 times as high at the end of the year as at the 
beginning, and the prices of cotton fabric, hosiery, leather 
footwear, and underwear were 12-16 times as high. There was an 
even more perceptible rise in the prices of office and school 
supplies, detergents, and building materials (16-25 times). 
  Medicine prices rose at a particularly dramatic rate--71 
times on the average and 150 or more times for some medications. 
  The rise in the cost of paid services was much higher than 
the rise in the cost of goods. Services cost almost 28 times as 
much at the end of the year as at the beginning--triple the rate 
of increase in the consumer prices for goods. Fees for notary 
services were more than 900 times as high as they were in 
December 1992, maritime transport rates were 95 times as high, 
motor transport fares were 31 times as high, and the services of 
public health and cultural establishments were 28-30 times as 
high. 
  The passage of Decree No 1001 of the Russian Federation 
Government of 2 October 1993 "On Immediate Measures for the 
State Support of the Maritime Kray Economy in 1993-1995" set 
electricity rates for industrial consumers at 40 rubles per 
kilowatt-hour, and the wholesale price for coal at the level for 
June the previous year--1,141 rubles a tonne. As a result, 
prices in power engineering were only 7.1 times as high at the 
end of the year as at the beginning, and the price of coal did 
not rise after October of last year, although the overall rise 
in wholesale prices in the basic industries was 10-12 times. 
This has had an adverse effect on the financial status of coal 
and power engineering facilities. 
  Freight transport rates were 20 times as high in 1993 as in 
1992, including 21 times for maritime transport and 11 times for 
motor transport. 
<H5>  Social Sphere </H5>
  The population of the kray was around 2,287,000 on 1 January 
1994 (77 percent urban). In the past year it decreased by almost 
15,000 (two-thirds of the decrease was the result of natural 
attrition). The birth rate decreased by 15 percent, but the 
death rate, on the contrary, rose 25 percent. 
  In 1993 more than 17,000 people in Maritime Kray got married 
and almost 13,000 marriages broke up. Young adults represented 
the highest percentage of those getting married and those 
getting divorced--women from 20 to 24 and men from 25 to 34 
after 5-9 years of living together. 
  The kray is still accepting refugees and people who have had 
to move out of regions racked by ethnic conflicts. The recorded 
number on 1 January this year was 1,725 (711 families), which is 
almost triple the figure for the beginning of last year. 
  Around a million workers and employees work in all branches 
of the economy. The proportional number of people employed in 
nonproduction branches was higher than it had been the previous 
year (almost 27 percent). 
  Although the rate of officially registered unemployment was 
relatively low--0.5 percent (6,966 people), in comparison with 
the Russian average of 0.85 percent, there was more hidden 
unemployment, taking the form of part-time employment, 
obligatory unpaid leaves, etc. 
  The monetary income of the population was 
estimated at 1.3033 trillion rubles for the year and was 14 
times as high as the figure for the previous year. 
  Monetary income in December was 41 percent higher than it 
had 
been the previous month and 19.4 times as high as it had been 
the previous December, but the respective increases after 
adjustments for rising prices were only 22 percent and 71 
percent. 
  The population spent 62 percent of its total income (68 
percent the previous year) on goods and services and 13 percent 
(10 percent the previous year) on taxes and various fees, 
deposited 5.7 percent (3.8 percent in 1992) in bank accounts, 
and acquired state bonds worth 118.1 million rubles and Russian 
Federation certificates worth 38.2 million rubles. The increase 
in personal deposits in branches of the Savings Bank was 42.4 
billion rubles, and the figure for commercial banks was 22.3 
billion rubles. The respective account balances on 1 January 
1994 were 52 billion rubles and 23.3 billion rubles, or 5.4 
times and 22.7 times the figures for 1 January 1993. 
  The population had over 255 billion rubles (20 percent of 
all 
income) in cash on hand at the end of the year. The reduction of 
available cash was covered constantly by the issuance of new 
currency, amounting to 263.2 billion rubles during the year 
(13.8 times as much as in 1992). The average monthly income of 
one worker in December was 244,400 rubles. It was 10.9 times as 
high as in December 1992 and 43 percent higher than in November 
1993. 
  The personnel of cultural establishments were on an unequal 
level. Their average monthly income in December was 132,000 
rubles, or 54 percent of the kray average. The respective 
figures for other spheres were 150,400 rubles and 62 percent for 
science, 141,900 rubles and 58 percent for public education, and 
175,400 rubles and 72 percent for public health. 
  The personnel of finance and credit establishments had an 
average monthly income of 865,700 rubles in December, or 3.5 
times the kray average. The significant difference was due to 
the income of commercial bank personnel. 
  Consumer market for goods and services: Consumer 
goods worth 705.3 billion rubles were produced in the kray 
during the year. This was 11.2 percent below the 1992 figure (in 
comparable prices). 
  The output of food and non-food items decreased in physical 
terms. The output of alcoholic beverages was 6.2 percent above 
the 1992 figure. 
  More than three-fourths of all consumer goods are food 
products (79 percent). The output of all of the products 
included in the minimum consumer budget was smaller than in 
1992. There were particularly perceptible decreases in the 
output of canned fish--48 percent, and of noodles, cereals, 
canned fruits and vegetables, margarine and whole-milk dairy 
products, bread and baked goods--24-28 percent. 
  There was a significant reduction (19 percent) in the output 
of non-food items, particularly the products of light industry 
(35 percent). The main reason for the unstable work of these 
enterprises was the shortage of working capital and difficulties 
in selling products as a result of the stronger emphasis in 
public demand on food products and of the larger supply of 
imported goods. 
  After household appliances and radios were unable to compete 
with imported equipment in the market, the output of radios was 
reduced by half and the output of washing machines was reduced 
by almost one-fourth. 
  The output of furniture in the kray was 13 percent below 
last 
year's figure, the output of china and pottery was 14 percent 
below, the output of facial soap was 32 percent below, and the 
output of household soap was 29 percent below. 
  The following data are indicators of the output of some 
non-food items: 


Products                       1993                     1993 in % of 1992

  Retail commodity turnover at officially registered trade 
enterprises was 636.6 billion rubles in 1993, or 10.2 times the 
1992 figure in actual prices. The sales volume decreased by 17.8 
percent in physical terms. 
  The population bought 365.9 billion rubles' worth of food 
(57.5 percent of all commodity turnover). 
  The reduction of sales volume in physical terms was recorded 
everywhere in the kray but the cities of Dalnegorsk and 
Ussuriysk. Sales of butter, tea, and liquor through the official 
network decreased by 20 percent and sales of meat and poultry, 
sausage, fish, eggs, sugar, potatoes, and vegetables through 
this network decreased by 40 percent because of high prices, 
inadequate supplies, and other reasons. 
  The official trade network had to compete with sales in the 
"free trade" sphere, with an estimated sales volume of 140 
billion rubles. This sphere was distinguished by brisk trade in 
alcoholic beverages, ice cream, fruit, and confectionery 
(especially imported candy). The number of markets selling 
clothing increased. The private market (including the consumer 
cooperative network and "free trade") took over much of the 
business of the state network. Its share decreased from 66 
percent in 1992 to 54 percent. In spite of all difficulties 
(common to the state network and the private market), the 
financial results of the private market were much more 
impressive. 
  At the beginning of the year and in the last two months of 
the year, meat was in short supply in one out of every four 
rayons or cities, there was an egg shortage in one out of every 
three, and sales of potatoes and vegetables were sporadic in 
Vladivostok and in Kirovskiy, Olginskiy, Oktyabrskiy, and 
Chuguyevskiy rayons. Sales of potatoes and vegetables decreased 
by 31 percent and 22 percent respectively in comparison with 
1992 figures. Average per capita sales for the year amounted to 
14 kilograms of potatoes, 13 kilograms of vegetables, and around 
5 kilograms of fruit. This is far below recommended dietary 
standards. 
  The population of rayons equivalent to the Far North in 
terms 
of delivery conditions had difficulty acquiring consumer goods 
last year. 
  There were shortages of seasonal items for adults and 
children, sporting goods, and toys for preschoolers and 
school-age children in the consumer market for nonfood items 
during the year. Sales of radios and electrical appliances were 
sporadic. 
  Reserve commodity stocks on 1 December were estimated at 
131.6 billion rubles, sufficient for 36 days of trade, or 9 days 
less than the previous December. Most of the stocks were 
concentrated at enterprises of the state trade network--78.4 
billion rubles (59.6 percent), the consumer cooperative 
network--26.6 billion rubles (20.2 percent), and private trade 
enterprises--24.5 billion rubles (18.6 percent). Reserve 
commodity stocks in Khorolskiy and Kirovskiy rayons and in 
Lesozavodsk and Partizansk were far below the kray average. 
  The commodity turnover of officially registered enterprises 
in the food service industry was 33 billion rubles, or 7.2 
percent below the 1992 figure (in comparable prices). Sales of 
their own products amounted to 21.3 billion rubles, or 4.3 
percent below the 1992 figure. 
  Paid services were performed for 102.6 billion 
rubles, which was 12 times as high as the figure for the 
previous year. The sales volume for paid services in physical 
terms was 55.3 percent below the previous year's figure. 
Enterprises in the state and municipal sector accounted for more 
than 83 percent of the total sales volume. The share of private 
enterprises is still negligible. 
  Housing and cultural-consumer construction: New 
residential buildings with a total area of 449,900 square 
meters, or 7,384 apartments, were completed last year, including 
52,500 square meters, or 723 apartments, in rural communities. 
The total amount of new housing was only slightly below last 
year's figure, by 300 square meters. 
  State enterprises and organizations were responsible for the 
construction of 54.4 percent of all new housing, joint-stock 
companies were responsible for 28.2 percent, economic 
partnerships were responsible for 9.7 percent, the population 
built 5.6 percent at its own expense or with state credit, and 
cooperatives built 0.8 percent. Annual housing start projections 
were fulfilled by 54.5 percent. Private residential construction 
rose slightly, accounting for 5.6 percent of the total. The 
amount of new housing in the following locations was below last 
year's figures: the cities of Artem, Vladivostok, Lesozavodsk, 
Dalnegorsk, and Bolshoy Kamen, and Anuchinskiy, Kavalerovskiy, 
Kirovskiy, Lazovskiy, Lesozavodskiy, Partizanskiy, 
Mikhaylovskiy, Pogranichnyy, Terneyskiy, Ussuriyskiy, 
Khankayskiy, Khasanskiy, and Khorolskiy rayons. The amount of 
new housing was more than double the figures for last year, 
however, in the following locations: the cities of Arsenyev and 
Dalnerechensk and Spasskiy, Chuguyevskiy, and Oktyabrskiy rayons. 
  New schools were opened for 2,546 students (79.8 percent of 
the previous year's figure), as well as new kindergartens for 
330 children (15.6 percent), polyclinics for 325 patients a day 
(78.3 percent), and clubs to accommodate 950 people. There were 
no new hospitals or vocational and technical institutes. Capital 
investments amounting to 12.1 billion rubles, or 87.5 percent of 
the previous year's figure, were used for the construction of 
basic facilities in the public utilities sector. These included 
10.69 kilometers of water lines, pumping stations for 3,000 
cubic meters of water a day, 0.4 kilometers of sewer lines, 
heating supply systems for 22.45 Gcal, and 17.42 kilometers of 
heat supply lines. 
  The main reason for the reduction of social construction 
projects in comparison with the previous year was the shortage 
of funds in local budgets and of clients. Federal budget 
allocations were extremely late in arriving and were 60-70 
percent of the promised amounts. 
  Public health: Outbreaks of several infectious 
diseases were recorded in the kray in 1993. There were 978 cases 
of diphtheria (16 times as many as in 1992), 1,701 cases of 
measles (20 times as many), 574 cases of whooping cough (2.8 
times as many), and 5,031 cases of viral hepatitis (1.4 times as 
many). 
  The rates of pediculosis (lice)--9,124 cases, as compared to 
8,429 in 1992, scabies (3.2 times the previous rate), 
syphilis--2.7 times the previous rate, and gonorrhea--1.2 times 
the previous rate--are still disturbing. 
  The number of reported cases of severe upper respiratory 
infections was the same as in 1992, and the number of cases of 
influenza was only one-third as high. 
  Education: There were 714 general education day 
schools, two schools attached to higher academic institutions 
(the academy of the Far Eastern Technology Institute and the 
business college of the Far Eastern State University), and 12 
private schools at the beginning of the 1993/94 academic year. 
  The curriculum of 147 of the schools offers intensive 
courses 
in various subjects, including five preparatory schools and 
three academies. 
  There were 39,500 new admissions to the first grade in state 
schools in the new academic year, and 2,500 of the children are 
attending preschool institutions. In addition, 256 others are 
doing course work in first-grade classes. 
  Just as in the last academic year, one out of every three 
schoolchildren attends a second or third shift, and the number 
of students in the third shift decreased by 8.7 percent. 
  In 1993, 17,200 students graduated from kray schools with a 
secondary school diploma, and 2,400 of them were simultaneously 
employed in the production sphere. 
  Vocational training was offered by 65 vocational and 
technical institutes, two of which (the Nakhodka Polytechnical 
College and the Vladivostok Liberal Arts and Engineering 
College) train specialists with a secondary specialized 
education. At the end of the year there were 23,800 students 
enrolled in vocational and technical institutes. During the year 
they trained 12,300 skilled workers. 
  Specialists with a higher and secondary specialized 
education 
are trained at 10 higher academic institutions and 36 secondary 
specialized academic institutions (including two colleges 
attached to vocational and technical institutes). Their 
respective enrollment figures at the beginning of the academic 
year were 41,100 and 27,900. 
  The number of specialists with a higher and secondary 
specialized education trained for the national economy in the 
1992/93 year was 7,200. The respective numbers of full-time 
students were 5,200 and 4,800. 
  The problem of placing graduates in jobs became much more 
acute. According to the data of academic institutions, 65.4 
percent of the graduates of higher academic institutions and 
55.6 percent of the graduates of secondary specialized 
institutions were placed in jobs, and the rest found jobs on 
their own. 
  Environmental protection: Capital investments in 
environmental protection and resource conservation projects 
amounted to more than 3.137 billion rubles, or 0.9 percent of 
all capital investments. This was 57.8 percent below the 1992 
figure. 
  Ecological conditions were as unsatisfactory last year as in 
previous years. The highest levels of air pollution were 
recorded in Vladivostok, Artem, and Spassk-Dalniy and in 
Pozharskiy Rayon. 
  There were 144 sudden accidental discharges and emissions 
during the year, including 74 accidental discharges into water 
resources. The resulting environmental damages amounted to 248.5 
million rubles. 
  Administrative actions were taken against 492 officials and 
citizens for violations of environmental laws, with the 
imposition of 16.1 million rubles in fines. Enterprises were 
sued for 708.5 million rubles for violations of this kind. 
  Administrative actions were taken against 734 officials and 
citizens for violations of laws protecting flora and fauna and 
of fishing regulations, including 14.4 million rubles in fines. 
  There were 284 forest fires on 11,300 hectares during the 
year. They consumed or damaged 52,200 cubic meters of timber 
stands. Timber losses were estimated at 77.4 million rubles. 
  Crime: There were 77,200 reported crimes in 1993, 
or 6.8 percent more than in 1992. The crime rate rose in almost 
all rayons of the kray. The number of crimes increased more than 
1.3-fold in Lazovskiy, Krasnoarmeyskiy, Kavalerovskiy, and 
Chuguyevskiy rayons. 
  Just as before, the majority of crimes (53.2 percent) were 
committed against the personal property of citizens. There were 
32,600 reported thefts of the personal property of citizens 
during the year, and around half were home burglaries. The 
number of robberies and muggings increased by 7 percent and 29 
percent respectively. 
  The number of felonies rose by 23.2 percent. One out of 
every 
five crimes was a felony. There were 754 homicides and attempted 
homicides, 1,704 cases of intentional infliction of serious 
bodily injury, and 266 rapes during the year. 
  The investigated crimes included 8,066 group crimes (an 
increase of 14.9 percent), 6,000 crimes committed by juveniles 
or with their participation, and 13,200 crimes committed in a 
state of intoxication. 
  Law enforcement agencies instituted criminal proceedings 
against 20,100 people during the year. The proportional number 
of solved crimes rose to 43 percent. 
<H5>  Material Resources </H5>
  The kray economy had difficulty acquiring supplies of all 
types of material and technical resources last year, 
particularly petroleum products, fuel, and thermal and 
electrical power. 
  The main reasons were the recession, the disruption of 
economic ties within Russia and with nearby foreign states, the 
higher shipping costs, the institution of advance payments for 
goods, and the insolvency of enterprises. The lack of financial 
resources precluded the accumulation of sufficient reserves of 
fuel for the heating season, which led to an energy crisis at 
the end of the year. 
  Fuel conservation reduced the output of electrical and 
thermal power. The shortages of these affected industrial 
enterprises and the population of the kray. 
  There were six commercial exchanges operating in the kray in 
1993. They conducted 545 trading sessions and concluded 2,250 
transactions. Total turnover in the exchanges was 468.8 billion 
rubles. The proportional amount of transactions in the sale of 
goods for production and technical use, however, did not amount 
to even 1 percent of the total. Consequently, the exchanges had 
virtually no effect on the supply of material resources in the 
kray economy. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  Enterprises, joint-stock companies, and partnerships of all 
forms of ownership produced goods worth 1.165 trillion rubles in 
existing prices in 1993, which was 6.8 times the indicator for 
1992. The physical volume of industrial production was 16.5 
percent smaller than the previous year's, including a reduction 
of 22.2 percent in December. 
  No branch of industry reached the 1992 production level. The 
payment crisis had its most severe effects on enterprises in the 
chemical industry, light industry, and the construction 
industry, where the reduction of output since 1992 was 48 
percent, 32 percent, and 27 percent respectively. The reduction 
of output was less sizable (up to 10 percent) in electrical 
power engineering, the fuel industry, the timber and woodworking 
industry, and the food industry, including the fish industry. 
  There were work stoppages in some production units at an 
average of 10-12 enterprises a month during the year because of 
shortages of crude resources, materials, fuel, electricity, and 
components and the insolvency of consumers. These losses 
amounted to 327,500 man-days during the year and cost the kray 
37 billion rubles. 
  More than half of all the year's losses were caused by 
difficulties in selling products (52.6 percent). 
  The fuel and energy complex produced 11.987 million tonnes 
of 
coal, 10.22 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 6.357 
million gigacalories of thermal power during the year, which was 
5-8 percent below the previous year's production levels. 
  In machine building and metalworking the decrease in 
production output stayed within the limits common to this branch 
throughout the year--16 percent. Machine building's contribution 
to kray production output was reduced by the effects of the 
conversion of enterprises of the defense complex, where the 
output was almost 20 percent smaller than in 1992. The 
production of civilian goods did not compensate for the reduced 
output of military products because the civilian output was also 
reduced. While the reduction of military output was equivalent 
to 16 percent, civilian output decreased by 22 percent. 
  The increase in social construction projects and private 
residential construction during the year increased the demand 
for the products of the construction materials industry, 
including cement. The slump in cement production was equivalent 
to only 47.5 percent by the end of the year, as compared to 82 
percent at the beginning of the year. 
  The slump in the production of building brick became less 
pronounced, decreasing from 36 percent in the first half of the 
year to 24 percent by the end of the year. The respective 
figures for prefabricated reinforced concrete structures were 32 
percent and 26 percent. 
  The timber and woodworking industry continued to suffer from 
a slump in the production of commercial timber, plywood, lumber, 
particle board, and fiberboard. 
  The catch of fish and other sea food in the fish industry 
was 
13 percent below the previous year's figure, which reduced the 
output of canned goods by almost half and the output of 
commercial fish products by 2 percent. 
  The denationalization of enterprises continued in industry 
last year. On 1 January 1994 almost one out of every four large 
and medium-sized industrial enterprises had been transferred to 
private and mixed forms of ownership. They accounted for 16 
percent of the industrial product. Non-governmental forms of 
ownership are most common in light industry, the food industry, 
metalworking, and the construction materials industry. 
  The largest reduction in output for the year (18 percent) 
was 
recorded at federally owned enterprises, and the reduction at 
kray-owned enterprises was 17 percent. Municipal enterprises and 
enterprises in the non-governmental ownership categories 
(private and mixed) experienced a minimal reduction in output--4 
percent in relation to the 1992 figure. 
<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  Investment dynamics were increasingly sluggish. Capital 
investments in 1990 were 4.7 times as high as in 1993 
(investments in 1991 were 3.8 times as high and investments in 
1992 were 1.3 times as high). Investments last year totaled 
354.8 billion rubles. The amount contributed by state 
enterprises and organizations to total capital investments was 
176.9 billion rubles (49.9 percent), joint-stock companies 
contributed 143.5 billion rubles (40.4 percent), and economic 
partnerships contributed 14.9 billion rubles (4.2 percent). 
  Enterprises and organizations of all forms of ownership used 
89.8 billion rubles in centralized investments during the year, 
including 53.7 billion rubles from the federal budget (54 
percent of the previous year's figure) and 36 billion rubles 
from the local budget (87.6 percent). 
  In spite of the severe fuel and energy crisis in Maritime 
Kray, investments in electrical power engineering were 36.6 
percent below the previous year's figure and amounted to 21.7 
billion rubles. The respective figures for the coal industry 
were 51.4 percent and 23.7 billion rubles. Investments also 
displayed a sizable decline in a branch of such vital importance 
as the medical industry (17 percent in relation to the previous 
year's figure) and in the construction industry (27.6 percent). 
  Capital investments in the agroindustrial complex were 46 
percent below the previous year's figure and amounted to 86.8 
billion rubles, including a decrease of 53 percent in 
centralized capital investments. The establishment of peasant 
and family farms cost 703 million rubles, or 0.8 percent of all 
capital investments in the agroindustrial complex. 
  The only branch of the kray economy experiencing a 
significant increase in investment (more than sevenfold) in 
comparison with the previous year's figure was maritime 
transport. 
  New fixed capital acquired in 1993 by enterprises and 
organizations of all forms of ownership cost 158.3 billion 
rubles, including 124.3 billion rubles for production 
facilities. Capacities were incorporated for the production of a 
million tonnes of coal at the Pavlovsk Coal Mine and for the 
production of datolite ore at the Bor Production Association; 
295.5 kilometers of 500-watt power transmission lines 
(Chuguyevka-PrimGRES [Maritime Kray Regional State Electrical 
Power Plant]) were installed, telephone service was automated 
for 10,200 telephones in Vladivostok and 1,500 in Novopokrovka, 
a shop was opened for the production of 3 million standard cans 
of fruit and vegetables at the Dalnerechensk Meat Combine, and 
several other facilities were established. Only two, however, of 
the 11 top-priority, budget-financed projects were completed. 
  Because of the substantial difference between the amount of 
capital investments used and the incorporation of fixed capital 
in the kray, the volume of unfinished construction increased 
dramatically and amounted to around 600 billion rubles, or 169 
percent of all capital investments used (as compared to the 
standard 70 percent). 
  The market for unfinished construction projects is still in 
the formative stage, and the demand for these facilities is 
negligible. Most of the demand was for unfinished social 
projects in the housing, trade, and food service sectors--9 of 
the 14 sold facilities. Only two production facilities were 
sold: a roofing materials shop and a bank of assembly shops at 
the Askold Plant. 
  Construction organizations of all forms of ownership and 
small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people performed work 
worth 246.3 billion rubles, representing 63.3 percent of last 
year's figure. The proportional amount of work performed by 
state enterprises decreased from 51 percent last year to 16.3 
percent this year. Productivity per worker was 40 percent higher 
in private firms than at state enterprises, average monthly 
wages were 13 percent higher, and average annual profits were 35 
percent higher. 
  The average recorded number of workers was 52,858 during the 
year, or 5,127 below the 1992 figure. Average monthly wages per 
worker during the year were 106,600 rubles, and average wages in 
December were 290,800 rubles. The state of settlements in the 
construction complex grew worse. Indebtedness for work and 
services performed by construction organizations amounted to 
59.752 billion rubles at the beginning of this year. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  The privatization process also extended to transport 
enterprises. Stock was issued first in enterprises of motor 
transport (17 units) and maritime transport (11 units). 
  Privatized enterprises represent 18 percent of the total. 
  The crisis in the kray economy had an adverse effect on 
public transport enterprises--state and privatized. 
  Freight shipments decreased by more than one-fourth.

  Maritime transport delivered 4.5 million tonnes of cargo to 
regions of the Far North (21 percent less than in 1992). The 
amount of freight shipped by coastal transport decreased 
considerably, and international freight shipments increased 
slightly. 
  Maritime trade ports handled 18.3 million tonnes of cargo, 
including 13.9 million tonnes of exports. Export volume 
increased by a third during the year. The proportional amount of 
export cargo rose from 60 percent of the total to 76 percent, 
and proportional imports decreased from 20 percent to 12 percent. 
  The volume of the main types of freight shipped by rail 
decreased: lumber, cement, petroleum products, chemical and 
mineral fertilizers, and mixed feeds. Cars stood idle for long 
periods on enterprise access roads because of delays in 
unloading. Fines for excessive layover time totaled 557.2 
million rubles during the year. 
  Joint-stock companies carried 98 percent of the freight 
shipped by motor transport. The development of foreign contacts 
contributed to an increase in international shipments by this 
form of transport. During the year motor transport handled 
595,000 tonnes of export and import freight (6 percent of the 
total), which was 63 percent above the figure for 1992. 
  The amount of freight shipped by air decreased on local 
airlines (by 20 percent) and international airlines (25 
percent). The amount of mail carried by air decreased by more 
than a third and the area of serviced agricultural lands and 
forests decreased by 22 percent. All of this was a result of 
high service rates. 
  Public transport carried more than 440 million passengers 
during the year, with municipal enterprises carrying 63 percent 
of the total. In all, passenger traffic increased by 6 percent 
in comparison with the 1992 figure, and passenger transport by 
air decreased by more than a third. Less expensive rail 
transport was preferred by more passengers. 
  Public communications enterprises performed 
services for 30.9 billion rubles during the year (a 13.6-fold 
increase in existing prices). Service rates rose several times 
during the year and were 23 times as high in December as they 
had been in December 1992. 
  The number of telephones increased by 8,165 and reached 
218,600, including the 158,200 phones of the population. 
  The installation of the 154 kilometers of the 60-channel 
Dalnegorsk-Terney cable line was completed, enhancing the 
quality and reliability of interurban telephone service in the 
northern regions. In addition, this will connect all cities and 
rayon centers in the kray to a single automated network. 
  New forms of communication were developed. Three business 
centers offering communication and data processing services, 39 
electronic mail subscription networks, and 775 subscription 
telefax and 13 public telefax services were established. The new 
forms of services produced almost 100 million rubles in income. 
  The subscription campaign for the first half of 1994 
indicated greater interest in subscription publications. 
Subscribers signed up for 1,281,400 copies of newspapers and 
magazines (112 percent of the subscription figures for the 
second half of 1993). This occurred in spite of the fact that 
the average subscription price tripled during this period. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Last year was marked by substantial structural changes in 
the 
branch. 
  The reregistration of sovkhozes and kolkhozes in accordance 
with the 1992 government decree was completed in the kray. This 
resulted in the establishment of 160 new partnerships of various 
types, 12 new agricultural cooperatives, one new auxiliary farm, 
and 11 new farms of other types. Nine kolkhozes and 40 sovkhozes 
retained their legal status. 
  Around 22,000 hectares of land were allocated for collective 
orchards and 14,000 hectares were allocated for collective 
vegetable gardens. They will be shared by 223,000 and 142,000 
families respectively. 
  The new producer network did not have time to develop during 
the reorganization of farms in the public sector. There was a 
decrease in the output of all of the main agricultural products. 
  The gross product (in 1983 prices) decreased by 7 percent 
and 
amounted to 659.3 million rubles. 
  The product per average annual worker in agriculture was 
6,679 rubles (8 percent below the 1992 figure). According to 
preliminary data, 206 farms will have ended the year with a 
profit, and 37 will have ended the year with losses. Net profits 
will amount to 14.5 billion rubles. 
  On 1 January 1994 there were 4,998 peasant farms with 77,800 
hectares of land (an average of 15.6 hectares per farm). 
  Many family farms (64 percent) received up to 10 hectares of 
land, and 0.9 percent received from 100 to 200 hectares. 
Meanwhile, 598 farms broke up. The highest numbers were in 
Mikhaylovskiy Rayon--20 percent, Chuguyevskiy Rayon--6.5 
percent, Spasskiy Rayon--6 percent, and the city of Artem--8 
percent. 
  The results of the harvest in the kray were disappointing. 
  Ongoing processes in the redistribution of land raised the 
proportion accounted for by private farms in the output of 
potatoes (from 66 percent in 1990 to 83 percent in 1993) and 
vegetables (from 36 to 67 percent). The reasons were the use of 
less mineral and organic fertilizers and pesticides than in 
1992, the shortage of fuel and lubricants, and the inoperability 
of some equipment. 
  The grain output after processing was 359,000 tonnes, 
including 11,000 tonnes of buckwheat and 30,000 tonnes of rice, 
and other output figures were 61,000 tonnes of soybeans, 384,000 
tonnes of potatoes, and 115,000 tonnes of vegetables. The gross 
yield of most agricultural crops in the kray displayed decreases 
ranging from 8 to 41 percent. The yield of potatoes increased by 
4 percent and the yield of vegetables increased by 40 percent. 
  Around 51,100 tonnes of grain were purchased for the state 
supply (28 percent less than in 1992). The lower level of 
compulsory deliveries, however, led to their fulfillment by 
121.6 percent. Sales of cereal crops (buckwheat and rice) 
amounted to around 23,000 tonnes (43 percent less than in 1992), 
sales of potatoes totaled 24,400 tonnes (36 percent less), and 
vegetable sales amounted to 22,900 tonnes (21 percent less). 
  Market relations affected sales channels, reducing the 
portion of the product acquired by the state and increasing the 
portion sold through other channels (the market, produce stands, 
the food service industry, and others). 
  Soybean sales amounted to 15,500 tonnes (48 percent less 
than 
in 1992). Obligatory deliveries of potatoes, vegetables, and 
soybeans were fulfilled by 53-62 percent. 
  In the animal husbandry sector, fewer products came from the 
dairy farms of agricultural enterprises, and the output of the 
private farmyards of citizens simultaneously increased. 
  Sales of livestock and poultry for slaughter in the kray 
decreased by 7,600 tonnes in comparison with the 1992 figure, 
milk sales decreased by 1,400 tonnes, egg sales decreased by 
70.1 million eggs, and the total sales of these products 
amounted to 71,700 tonnes, 276,400 tonnes, and 400.5 million 
units respectively. 
  There were 305,400 head of cattle in the kray on 1 January 
1994 (10 percent less than in 1992), including 126,300 cows (5 
percent less). There were 261,000 pigs (13 percent less). There 
were 21,500 sheep and goats, which was 8 percent higher than the 
1992 figure. 
  Kolkhozes, peasant farms, and workers and employees owned 20 
percent of all the cattle in the kray, 37 percent of the cows, 
41 percent of the pigs, and 94 percent of the sheep and goats. 
Reproduction indicators declined. 
  The rate of epizootic disease in cattle rose on 83 farms, 
the 
rate of disease in pigs increased on 58 farms, the number of new 
calves decreased on 113 farms, and the number of new piglets 
decreased on 80 farms. Milk yield per cow was 65 kilograms more 
than in 1992 and amounted to 1,775 kilograms. The average laying 
hen produced 206 eggs, which was the same as the previous year's 
figure. 
  Many farms did not have an adequate supply of feeds. They 
had 
10.4 quintals of feed units per standard head of livestock, as 
compared to 11.1 units in 1992. Feed supplies were least 
adequate in the city of Artem and in Kavalerovskiy, 
Nadezhdinskiy, and Partizanskiy rayons. The problem is 
compounded by the use of the feeds without preliminary 
processing on most farms because of the inoperability of 
equipment in more than half of the feed shops and feed kitchens 
in several rayons. 
  Purchases of kray products amounted to 29,100 tonnes of 
livestock and poultry (in live weight), 133,000 tonnes of milk, 
and 271 million eggs, which were below the 1992 figures by 9-20 
percent. 
  Substandard livestock and livestock sold through direct 
channels amounted to 11,400 tonnes, representing more than 39 
percent of the total. 
  Private farms sold 2,700 tonnes of livestock (9 percent of 
the total), more than 3,000 tonnes of milk (2.3 percent), and 
600,000 eggs (0.2 percent). 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  The kray's foreign trade through direct channels in 1993 
amounted to 695.3 million U.S. dollars, with exports accounting 
for 64 percent of the total. The kray's main foreign trade 
partners are China (43.5 percent of all exports and imports), 
Japan (27 percent), and France (9 percent). 
  Raw materials are still predominant in the structure of 
exports. Exports through direct channels included 115,400 tonnes 
of fish and fish products, 168,500 cubic meters of lumber, 
42,300 tonnes of fertilizer, and 398,000 tonnes of ferrous 
metals. Besides this, 4,700 tonnes of copper ore, 19,000 tonnes 
of boric acid, 630,000 cubic meters of lumber, and 51,700 tonnes 
of fish products were exported through foreign trade 
associations. 
  The main elements of the import structure are consumer 
goods, 
motor vehicles, spare parts, and services performed for our 
enterprises abroad (ship repairs and commercial and transport 
services). 
  Enterprises and organizations in the kray deposited 741.7 
million U.S. dollars in foreign currency accounts, including 
696.5 million dollars for exported goods and services. The 
enterprises spent 735.4 million dollars. The remainder, 
including the balance at the beginning of the year, was 90.5 
million U.S. dollars. 
  The kray received 5,000 tonnes of food and 114 tonnes of 
various types of freight from Japan, the United States, India, 
and South Korea in humanitarian aid.

<F P=106> [Article by Denis Demkin and Viktor Ivanov: "Far East Ready </F>
To Declare Its Own Special Economic Interests"] 
  [Text] Today the Maritime Kray administration is conducting 
a discussion of the report "Prospects of Maritime Kray Under 
Conditions of the Transition to the Market in Light of the 
Geostrategic and Economic Interests of Russia," developed by the 
Institute of National Economic Forecasting of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, on the order of the Russian Federation 
State Committee for Industrial Policy and the Maritime Kray 
administration. In the opinion of the kray leadership, this work 
will enable the formulation of basic principles of mutual 
relations with the federal government. Following the discussion, 
the report will be sent to the Russian Government and, 
apparently, will be a significant step in recognition of the 
special economic interests of the Far East. 
<H5>  The Far East: Russia or the APR? </H5>
  The report that has been prepared for discussion is in 
essence one of the first really hard attempts by regional 
authorities to declare not simply the special significance of 
the Far East for Russia's economic and political interests, but 
the Far East's own economic interests in the Asia-Pacific Region 
(APR) as well. The significance of the Far East to Russia, in 
the view of the report's authors, is related to the obvious 
change in the geographic reference points of Russia's economic 
interests and to the necessity of strategically reorienting 
foreign trade on the voluminous and diversified APR market 
(insofar as increasing non-raw material exports to West European 
and United States markets is today practically ruled out) under 
conditions of Russia's loss of ports in the West. A special role 
is played by the concentration of basic raw material resources 
in Russia's east and their exhaustion in the western regions. 
  In this regard, the report emphasizes, the Maritime Kray 
authorities may well demand that the federal government effect 
priority resolution of their economic problems. Specific 
measures on the federal level which must be undertaken include: 
the immediate return of debts incurred by the federal 
government; regulation of mutual relations between the federal 
government and the regional budget; granting to the local 
administration of the right to set independent quotas and 
license exports, as well as to regulate the amounts of customs 
duties for exported production output and imported goods 
purchased by the kray to produce competitive export and 
import-substituting output. 
  The authors of the report stress that in the event these 
demands are not met, the region's economic problems may lead to 
an intensification of the already existing trend of "gradual 
economic alienation of Russia and the Far East, with gradual 
integration of the entire economy of the region into the APR 
economy and separation from the national economic complex of 
Russia." Although such declarations are at present clearly 
intended just to exert a certain pressure on the federal 
authorities, one cannot help but admit that the prospects of 
reorientation of the Far East away from "European Russia" and 
toward the APR are indeed entirely realistic. 
<H5>  The Far East-APR: Already Special Relations Exist </H5>
  In the view of experts, "openness" of the economy as well as 
a "special relationship"--at least between certain parts of the 
Far East and the APR--have essentially already developed. Nine 
nonfreezing ports, five border crossing points to the People's 
Republic of China, and six customs offices, for example, are 
presently situated in Maritime Kray. The volume of export and 
import shipments by road and transshipments through port and 
railroad border stations and ports of Maritime Kray exceeded 
27.5 million tonnes in 1993. Over the first nine months of 1993, 
the region's exports amounted to $315,405,000; 
imports--$167,910,000. Some 33.3 percent of the total trade 
volume is attributable to trade with China, 33.8 percent--with 
Japan, 7.9 percent--with Singapore. 
  The export trade structure (direct trade ties) of Maritime 
Kray is as follows: fish--42.8 percent, canned fish--11 percent, 
ferrous metals--20 percent, then lumber and fertilizers. Imports 
consist mainly of food products and consumer items. 
  As of today, 51 representations of foreign firms have opened 
in Maritime Kray, including 29 Japanese, six of the Republic of 
Korea, and others from China, Australia, and Vietnam. As of 1 
November 1993, 692 enterprises having foreign investments were 
registered in Maritime Kray, 272 of these being in the territory 
of the Nakhodka Free Economic Zone. Foreign investors 
participating in the organization of joint enterprises are 
represented by 37 countries, APR countries once again taking the 
lead here: People's Republic of China--198 enterprises, 
Japan--45, United States--44, Republic of Korea--22, Hong 
Kong--14, and Australia--11. 
  In the opinion of regional experts, the following represent 
extremely good prospects for the future: cooperation with Japan 
in the sphere of specialized coastal fishing utilizing Japan's 
experience; organization in Maritime Kray of the cultivation and 
processing of soybeans for export to Japan and third countries 
(there are already offers to the Japanese firm Mitsubishi Corp. 
for joint production of soybeans and the export of 3,000 tonnes 
per year of finished production to Japan). Naturally, special 
hopes are being placed in the development of raw material 
exports--specifically, plans exist for the joint exploitation of 
polymetallic ore deposits in Maritime Kray. 
<H5>  International Trade: Which Bloc To Join? </H5>
  Taking into account the traditional key role played by 
foreign trade in the economic development both of Russia in 
general and of its particular regions, modern trends in 
international trade may exert quite a significant influence on 
the destiny of the Far East economy. In recent times, experts 
have increasingly been leaning towards the view that world trade 
will break up more and more into regional trade blocs in the 
foreseeable future. In addition to the already functioning 
European bloc, the formation of an American trade bloc is 
expected (which will include countries of Central and South 
America as well as the United States and Canada). Finally, it is 
entirely likely that in the final analysis an Asian trade bloc 
will be formed in the APR. Such a regional division of trade is 
essentially already taking place--the share of intra-regional 
trade in the European trade bloc is 70 percent; in the American 
trade bloc it is 50 percent; and in the Asian bloc--40 percent. 
  Prospects for economic integration in the APR have been 
attracting the greatest attention in recent times. Despite the 
traditional political contradictions among APR countries, such 
prospects are entirely realistic when we take into account the 
fact that Japan has recently clearly reoriented its foreign 
trade away from the United States and towards the Asian 
countries (especially Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and 
Singapore). As a result, according to prognoses, the proportion 
of intra-regional trade within the APR will exceed 50 percent by 
the year 2000. Moreover, United States and West European firms 
have recently ceased to comprise the main foreign investors in 
the region, being replaced by the "Asian Four" 
countries--Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong. 
  Division of the world market into regional trade blocs 
enables us to draw a somewhat unexpected conclusion. One Russian 
region or another will be able to dynamically develop its 
foreign trade only if it attaches itself to one bloc or another. 
Taking into account purely the geographic position of different 
regions, however, a clear divergence of interests emerges 
here--it is clearly more convenient for the European regions of 
Russia to join with the European bloc, and for the Far East--the 
Asian bloc. Paradoxical as this may seem, in the event it joins 
the Asian trade bloc, the Far East will become especially 
attractive for direct investments by American and European 
firms, which believe that under conditions of regional division 
of world trade, access to the markets of the Asian bloc can be 
obtained only through direct investments in the countries that 
comprise this bloc. It is clear in any case that entry--formal 
or even informal--into the regional trade and economic group as 
an independent economic entity will open up fairly significant 
economic prospects for the Far East. It is equally evident, 
however, that in the final analysis this may require not just 
appropriate economic changes, but political ones as well.

Raw Materials, approved by RF First Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Economic Relations M.Ye. Fradkov on 2 December 1993, No. 
112/5560; approved by First Deputy Chairman Yu.N. Khachaturov of 
Russian State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and the Support 
of New Economic Structures on 10-11 November 1993, No. 
YuKh/5091; recorded by Russian Ministry of Justice on 29 
December 1993, No. 448; PRAVO I EKONOMIKA is a weekly supplement 
to DELOVOY MIR] 
  [Text] Pursuant to Edict No. 628 of the President of the 
Russian Federation of 14 June 1992 "On the Procedure for 
Exporting Strategic Raw Materials," the following procedure has 
been established for the registration of enterprises and 
organizations authorized to export these commodities. 
  1. The decision to grant, renew, suspend, or revoke all or 
part of the rights of enterprises and organizations to export 
strategic raw materials will be approved by the Collegium of the 
Russian MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] on the 
basis of the conclusions of the Registration Commission of the 
Russian MVES. The appropriate announcement will be sent to the 
Russian Federation State Customs Committee, the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and the 
Support of New Economic Structures, and regional representatives 
of the Russian MVES, will be reported to the applicant, and will 
be published in the press. 
  The members of the Registration Commission of the Russian 
MVES will be representatives of the Russian MVES, the Russian 
GTK [State Customs Committee], the Russian Ministry of 
Economics, the Russian GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly 
Policy and the Support of New Economic Structures], the Russian 
Ministry of Finance, the Russian Committee on Industrial Policy, 
the Russian Central Bank, the Russian Ministry of Security, the 
Russian Federal Currency and Export Control Service, the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Moscow State Internal Affairs 
Administration, and the ministries producing strategic raw 
materials. 
  The membership of the Registration Commission of the Russian 
MVES and changes in it will be approved by an order of the 
Russian MVES, based on official recommendations from the 
appropriate ministries and departments. 
  2. Enterprises and organizations (hereafter referred to as 
enterprises) wishing to apply for authorization to export these 
commodities will submit the following documents to the 
administration of the Russian MVES representative in their 
region for consideration: 
  --a written request for registration, addressed to the 
Russian Federation deputy minister of foreign economic 
relations. The request will include a brief description of the 
goods handled by the enterprise and their code numbers in the 
Commodity Index of the Foreign Economic Directory; 
  --a registration form in quadruplicate; 
  --notification from an agency of the Russian Goskomstat 
[State Committee for Statistics] on the assignment of a CPDR 
[control and planning department report] code (8 letters); 
  --notarized copies of articles of incorporation (with all 
supplements and revisions) and certification of the registration 
of the enterprise as a party to business activity within the 
territory of the Russian Federation; 
  --a statement from a bank of the Russian Federation 
verifying 
the existence of ruble and foreign currency accounts, with a 
letter of recommendation confirming the solvency of the 
enterprise, and the applicant's own statement that he, or the 
firm in which he has an economic interest, has accounts in 
foreign banks; 
  --the financial report of the enterprise for the preceding 
year; 
  --a list of executed contracts on the stated group of 
commodities, indicating the basic terms of the contracts, 
contract prices, and export volume, signed by the administrators 
of the enterprise--the applicant and his financial service, and 
stamped by a notary. 
  On the basis of these documents and with the consent of tax, 
customs, and other regulatory agencies and agencies of the 
executive branch of government of members of the Russian 
Federation, the authorized representative of the Russian MVES 
will prepare his conclusion, recommending the registration of 
the enterprise as an exporter of strategic raw materials (or the 
denial of the request), and will forward the whole set of 
documents to the Russian MVES. 
  Documents for consideration must be submitted in full and 
must be compiled and collated in the proper manner. In the event 
of doubts about the financial reliability of the 
applicant-enterprise, the Registration Commission of the Russian 
MVES may request the enterprise to submit a report on its latest 
audit. 
  3. The Russian MVES will be responsible for entering all 
data 
in the Register of Enterprises Exporting Strategic Raw Materials. 
  The registered enterprise will receive a registration 
certificate. 
  When the enterprise which has been authorized to export 
strategic raw materials receives the certificate of 
registration, it will sign the "Pledge of Exporters of Strategic 
Raw Materials" (Addendum 1). 
  4. The certificate will be valid for one year from the date 
of the decision of the Collegium of the Russian MVES and will be 
renewed each subsequent year if the exporter complies with the 
requirements of this statute. 
  5. Enterprises authorized to export strategic raw materials 
will submit the following documents for the renewal of their 
certificates: 
  a) to the Registration Commission of the Russian MVES: 
  --an application with an attached report on foreign economic 
activity (Addendum 2), indicating the existence and terms of 
contracts for the export of the strategic raw materials the 
enterprise has been authorized to export; 
  --documented information on deposits of foreign currency 
proceeds from export operations in registered foreign currency 
accounts, declared at the time of registration as an exporter of 
strategic raw materials, in authorized banks of the Russian 
Federation; 
  --the conclusion of the regional representative of the 
Russian MVES, recommending the renewal of (or refusal to renew) 
the certificate; 
  b) to the Main Economic Administration of the Russian 
Federation MVES: 
  --statistical reports for the year of operations as an 
exporter of strategic raw materials on forms No. 12-VES (Russian 
Goskomstat Decree No. 21 of 14 April 1992), No. 8-VES (Russian 
Goskomstat Decree No. 123 of 7 August 1992), and No. 10-VES 
(Russian Goskomstat Decree No. 47 of 8 June 1992). 
  6. The decision to register or renew the registration 
certificate of the enterprise seeking authorization to export 
strategic raw materials, or the decision to deny the application 
for good cause, will be made within 60 days from the date of the 
receipt of the application with all attached documents listed in 
subsections 2 and 5 of this statute, and will be reported to the 
applicant. 
  7. The refusal to register or renew the registration 
certificate of (or refusal to reregister) the enterprise seeking 
authorization to export strategic raw materials and the decision 
to revoke the right to export strategic raw materials may be 
based on any of the following grounds: 
  --the violation of existing laws of the Russian Federation 
and legislative instruments of the Russian MVES, Russian 
Ministry of Finance, Russian Central Bank, Russian GKAP, and 
Russian GTK on matters of currency, financial, customs, and 
antimonopoly regulation and the regulation of foreign economic 
activity, including timely and complete settlements with the 
budget, the customs service, and so forth, and the materials of 
the Russian Federal Currency and Export Control Service, 
agencies of the executive branch of government of members of the 
Russian Federation, regional representatives of the Russian 
MVES, customs and tax services, and law enforcement agencies 
pertaining to foreign economic activity; 
  --violations of foreign laws with economically or 
politically 
injurious effects on Russia; 
  --the nonfulfillment of delivery commitments for exports of 
strategic raw materials; 
  --the unsubstantiated refusal to perform mediating services 
for enterprises and organizations in the export of strategic raw 
materials or the advancement of unsubstantiated demands in the 
conclusion of commission contracts; 
  --the export of commodities from the Russian Federation at 
understated (dumping) prices; 
  --restrictive business practices (pricing agreements, 
division of the market, etc.) and unscrupulous competition; 
  --the nonfulfillment of commitments for deliveries for state 
needs (in the presence of the appropriate agreements); 
  --the late submission of reports on forms No. 12-VES, No. 
8-VES, and No. 10-VES; 
  --late or incomplete deposits of foreign currency proceeds 
in 
the accounts of authorized banks of the Russian Federation that 
were declared at the time of the enterprise's registration as an 
exporter of strategic raw materials; 
  --the late submission of a notarized bank statement to the 
Registration Commission of the Russian MVES from an authorized 
bank of the Russian Federation on foreign currency transactions 
in the accounts declared at the time of the enterprise's 
registration as an exporter of strategic raw materials. 
  The commission of the violations listed in this subsection 
of 
the statute will be confirmed by an agency with the legal 
authority to investigate these matters. 
  8. Registered enterprises will conclude agreements to 
perform 
mediating services for other enterprises and organizations, 
irrespective of their property status, in exports of strategic 
raw materials. 
  9. The Russian MVES will send information about enterprises 
exporting strategic raw materials to the Russian GTK, the 
Russian Ministry of Economics, the Russian GKAP, the Russian 
Ministry of Finance, the Russian Central Bank, regional 
representatives of the Russian MVES, and the Russian 
Federation's trade representatives abroad. 
  10. The refusal to reregister an enterprise and the decision 
to revoke its right to export strategic raw materials will 
remain in force for up to one year and will be accompanied by 
the exclusion of the enterprise from the register. 
  The decision to exclude the enterprise from the register 
will 
be made according to the procedure stipulated in Subsection 1 of 
this statute. In order to secure the fulfillment of contract 
obligations, primarily for deliveries of strategic raw materials 
for state needs, in the case of contracts signed prior to the 
date of the decision of the Collegium of the Russian MVES to 
revoke the enterprise's right to export strategic raw materials 
or the decision to deny its application for reregistration, the 
enterprise's certificate of registration will remain valid until 
all of these contract obligations have been fulfilled in their 
entirety, but for no more than three months from the date of the 
decision of the Collegium of the Russian MVES. 
  The decisions of the Registration Commission of the Russian 
MVES to exclude enterprises from the register may be reviewed by 
the Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy 
and the Support of New Economic Structures and challenged in the 
manner established by law. 
  If the Russian GKAP discovers violations of the established 
rules and procedures of decisionmaking, it will be entitled to 
request the Russian MVES for the reconsideration of the 
enterprise's application for registration (or reregistration) by 
the Registration Commission of the Russian MVES. 
  11. The Statute on the Procedure for Registering Enterprises 
and Organizations Authorized To Export Strategic Raw Materials, 
approved by the Russian MVES, No. 10-42/2686 of 6 July 1992, No. 
GKAP VCh/2940 of 8 July 1992, and recorded by the Russian 
Ministry of Justice on 14 July 1993, No. 8, will be invalid.

<F P=106> [Interview with UPTs-KP Church Metropolitan Antoniy </F>
(Masendich) by Vasiliy Anisimov, manager of the department of 
political research, under the rubric "Expos&eacute;": "The 
Repentance of Metropolitan Antoniy"] 
  [Text] You will not envy Metropolitan Pereyaslav and 
Sicheslav Antoniy (Masendich) of the UPTs-KP. A year and a half 
ago, as the right-hand man of UAPTs [Ukrainian Autocephalous 
Orthodox Church] Patriarch Mstislav, he took part without the 
knowledge of the leader of his church in dealings sanctioned by 
the ruling nomenklatura--the infamous unification of 
the Orthodox churches of Ukraine--and for all that time 
steadfastly repelled attacks on its blood offspring, the 
UPTs-Kievan Patriarchate [UPTs-KP] and the defrocked monk 
Filaret, rescued from political oblivion. The results of the 
unification, as should have been expected, were lamentable. 
Instead of two Orthodox churches in Ukraine, there have come to 
be three. The people did not go to the "unified" church (the 
UPTs-KP). UAPTs Patriarch Mstislav, demeaned by state 
bureaucrats and betrayed by his former comrades-in-arms, has 
died. The autocephalous church itself, which they abolished 
without its own knowledge, has come under the repression of the 
authorities. The historical Orthodox Church of Ukraine--the UPTs 
of Vladimir (Sabodan)--has begun to be blackened in the 
presidential/Filaret mass media and on Ukrainian television, and 
the search for "traitors," non-patriots and "agents of Moscow" 
has started. The heretofore unprecedented stormings of Orthodox 
cathedrals by Cossacks and UNSO people have shaken the already 
brittle civil peace in Ukraine. The policies of L. Kravchuk and 
his team in the field of religion, in short, have led to a 
crisis in Ukrainian Orthodoxy and a schism in it. The bishops, 
tired of the lies and unreconciled to the role of puppets to 
which they have been relegated, have begun to quit the UPTs-KP 
(there have already been more than ten). One of the founders of 
the Kievan Patriarchate and the business manager of that church, 
Metropolitan Antoniy (Masendich), has also finally left. 
  [V. Anisimov] Archbishop, you are one of the founding 
fathers 
of the UPTs-KP. Many unpleasant rumors are currently circulating 
around the unification of the church, which many, including the 
General Procurator of Ukraine, still consider to be illegal... 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] I will not conceal the fact that my 
departure from the Russian Orthodox Church was dictated by 
patriotic aspirations. The programs of the Liberty and Voice of 
America radio stations prompted me to that, so that I could 
leave for Ukraine. You know my activity of that period. I came 
to Bondarchuk, at the time the Metropolitan Ioann (UAPTs). I of 
course had the desire to see that the Orthodox Church in Ukraine 
became independent. At Bondarchuk's they convinced me that the 
episcopal ordinations of his organization were canonical (I 
appealed to Metropolitan Andrey and Filaret's now-bishop Daniil 
on that score). In coming to the UAPTs, I understood that our 
church would have to be in isolation, but I had no doubt that 
the Moscow Patriarchate would in time grant autocephaly to the 
UPTs, and there would be a unified Orthodox Church in Ukraine in 
union with the Russian and other local churches of world 
Orthodoxy. Who could suppose that I would become an enemy of the 
canonical priesthood in which I served for ten years, and they 
my enemies? That has subsequently been a constant source of pain 
for me. 
  I have been able to rise high up the ecclesiastical ladder 
of 
the UAPTs thanks to Patriarch Mstislav. I did not intend to go 
to Kiev, by the way, but the patriarch himself sent me there. 
  [V. Anisimov] You became the number two person in the UAPTs 
and, essentially, have been leading this church in Ukraine? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] Yes. I assumed that I would be able 
to 
make use of my high position. So as to move closer to the 
legitimate Orthodox Church, and seek out ways by which the UAPTs 
would gain canonical status. And everything was moving toward 
that. But the Metropolitan Filaret was standing in the way. He 
was the designated successor of the UPTs at the time, and you 
know his sharp statements against autocephaly. 
  I was on a visited to Kharkov when a report came in that 
Filaret had gone into retirement. That was a joyous event, of 
course; I called the Council for Religious Affairs and asked 
whether it was not time to congratulate the Metropolitan 
Vladimir (Sabodan). I assumed that it would be namely he, 
enjoying a great reputation within Orthodoxy, who would head the 
Ukrainian church. They told me, however, to hold off for the 
time being. 
  Meanwhile Filaret, having promised to retire, changed course 
sharply upon his return to Kiev. Rumors moreover began reaching 
me that Bishop of our church Vladimir (Romanyuk) had begun 
appearing with Filaret. Romanyuk told me that he had discussed 
with Filaret questions of bringing the positions of our churches 
closer together. But there was no talk of a unification with 
Filaret, since I have known him since I had been a cleric of the 
RPTs [Russian Orthodox Church] and member of the local synod 
that had elected Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church 
Aleksey II, and I had no illusions with regard to Filaret. 
  Events, however, had begun to develop rapidly. The UAPTs was 
just preparing to celebrate the second anniversary of the synod 
that elected Patriarch Mstislav. The patriarch, having blessed 
its holding, was not able to attend. I was given authority at 
the synod (owing to the absence of the patriarch) to make 
decisions at my own discretion, after telephone consultations 
with Mstislav. Then I was unexpectedly called by Filaret's 
personal assistant, who passed along a request for a meeting. I 
went. Filaret was in a terrible fright, since the clergy of the 
UPTs had now come to accept the residency of the designated 
successor of the UPTs at Pushkinskaya (this was impeded at the 
time by the UNSO and the police.--V.A.). I told 
Filaret, "If you do not go, they will punish you, take away your 
holy office." He brushed it aside: they wouldn't dare to do 
that, since the church and many of the higher clergy supposedly 
stood behind him. Then Kiev ceremoniously welcomed the new 
designated successor of the UPTs Vladimir (Sabodan). His first 
service was at the Kiev-Pecherskaya monastery, and I of course 
went to the night services. But some monk recognized me and fell 
upon me: "You are a schismatic, and there is nothing for you to 
do here." That stung me very much. After the service I went by 
Vladimir Cathedral. It was closed (the Filaret people were 
afraid that the faithful would hand it over to the legitimate 
church--the UPTs.--V.A.), but a service was underway. 
They met me joyously, to my surprise. Bishop Spiridon announced 
straight away that here, as he said, the Muscovites have seized 
everything, and therefore we will have an association with the 
autocephalous church, which came to us for help. I did not 
understand anything. I knew that UNSO had risen in defense of 
Filaret, but I did not understand what the UAPTs was doing here. 
Spiridon reported that a unification synod had already been 
planned, and we would be together. I said "Archbishop, whatever 
are you talking about, what unification? I am the metropolitan, 
the business manager for the UAPTs, and I don't know anything." 
Spiridon answered that Vladimir (Romanyuk) had already agreed on 
everything with Filaret. But who is this Romanyuk? He is just a 
vicar bishop, and has no right to agree on anything with anyone. 
Spiridon came to see me again in the evening at 
Trekhsvyatitelskaya, and tried to convince me to meet with 
Filaret. I acceded to his request... 
  Filaret was agitated. I sympathized somewhat: it is hard, I 
said, to part with the money, with the exarchate building, the 
Vladimir Cathedral. He got right to the point: "If I transfer to 
your accounts the money of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, where 
is the guarantee that you will not take it?" (four billion 
karbovantsi, according to some reports.--V.A.). 
  I naturally couldn't sleep all night, trying to get in touch 
with the Patriarch Mstislav in order to find out how to behave 
and what to do. But I couldn't reach him, either at the office 
or at home. In the morning, realizing what the consequences of 
this action could be, I left the city, having resolved not to 
undertake anything without the patriarch. But I was now not able 
to avoid it. A delegation appeared in my office at 
Trekhsvyatitelskaya: Pavlychko, Chervoniy, Porovskiy, Skorik, 
Ternopolskiy etc. They announced immediately that they had been 
given the assignment of convening a unification synod of the 
UAPTs. You know what events are occurring, we must act 
immediately. I was stubborn: I do not have the right to do that, 
I said. You must, this is a directive of the President of 
Ukraine, was the answer. 
  [V. Anisimov] You mean to say that the initiator of the 
wheeling and dealing for the rescue of Filaret and the donations 
of Ukrainian Orthodoxy appropriated by him was Leonid Kravchuk? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] I had a great many doubts on just 
that 
score myself. They were evidently simply using his name. They 
knew, after all, that I wouldn't pick up the phone and call--is 
it true, Leonid Makarovich? The deputies, of course, asserted 
that all of the higher officials coming out against Filaret 
would be removed from their positions. Kolesnik (the Filaret 
supporter Zinchenko took his place) and Pilipenko (Procurator 
General Shishkin, who had protested the unification synod, 
suffered the same fate a year later--V.A.) really did 
soon "fall." The deputies moreover promised that the President 
would hand over Sofiya Kiev and all the rest to us if we would 
accept Filaret. Kravchuk and Filaret are of course linked by 30 
years of joint work in the ideological field, and they say that 
they are even dacha neighbors (I, by the way, have never had the 
honor of being in their company and participating in their 
confidential discussions). I nonetheless do not think that the 
President has an unequivocal attitude toward the UPTs-KP. I also 
consented to unification because the deputies assured me that 
Filaret would be in the leadership for only three or four 
months, and then they would "carry him off to his rest." It is, 
after all, a disgrace even for one's own children to associate 
with someone deprived of his holy office and exposed in the 
press. Filaret himself said that he would have no claim to 
authority in the church, but that means that the opportunity has 
appeared before us for negotiations and unification with the 
canonical Orthodox Church of Ukraine. 
  [V. Anisimov] You were not surprised that half of the 
deputy-tempters were Greco-Catholics? What relation do they have 
to Orthodoxy? Why were they not, say, seeking the unification of 
their own church with the Catholic Church in Rome and 
independence from the Rome patriarchate? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] That, of course, put me on guard. I 
declared that I should consult with the Patriarch Mstislav 
(after all, he cannot stand Filaret). Pavlychko snapped that 
this was not my concern at all: it would be easier to call the 
patriarch from the President's residence and smooth everything 
over. What was left for me to do? I promised the deputies I 
would report to all the bishops and consult. No, they insisted. 
We are going to Filaret right now to coordinate the terms of the 
unification and so forth. They had to go. The conversation with 
Filaret was reduced to one thing--everyone was in danger. The 
Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan) is gathering a synod at the 
monastery, after which all of the property would pass to the 
UPTs. We were thus obliged to outrace them. I was surprised: 
"But there are three days left. Who would have time to organize 
a synod in that time?" "Convene immediately for Thursday, and 
there will be a joint service in Kiev as early as Friday," was 
the reply. 
  That night I tried again to get hold of the patriarch and 
even sent him a fax, but there was no answer. Then I called 
Archbishop Andrey of Ivano-Frankivsk (headed of the largest 
diocese of the UAPTs). I told him that we were being promised 
Sofiya and all the rest, and asked for advice. If Andrey had not 
supported me, then I would not have risked convening the higher 
orders of the clergy. But he said that the patriarch was abroad, 
and we evidently had to heed what the deputies were saying. I 
called around to the bishops, and called them to Kiev 
immediately. But I did not tell them the purpose. 
  They assembled on Thursday morning (with the exception of 
Peter Lviv (who was ill) and Vasiliy Ternopol). The deputies 
came as well--aside from the company already mentioned, 
Zinchenko came, as well as Viktor Burlakov from Rukh, who today 
heads something in the SBU. I was informing the bishops when 
Andrey Ivano-Frankivsk suddenly rose and declared 
unceremoniously that he would not enter into any unification 
whatsoever. Larisa Skorik and Romanyuk pounced on the "striker" 
at once: you, they said, are a traitor, an agent of Moscow etc. 
But the threats did not have any effect: three bishops--Andrey, 
Anatoliy (Fialko) and Nikolay (Grokh)--left the synod right 
then. The ill Peter Lviv was represented by Vladimir Yarema. He 
went to the synod, which caused a great scandal with Chervoniy. 
Had there been no pressure from the deputies, and they were 
still there in force, neither I nor the bishops would have gone 
for unification for anything. Filaret has moreover asserted that 
the UPTs bishops support him. But none of the twelve members of 
the higher clergy went for Filaret. 
  We were to serve in Sofiya on the second day of the synod. 
And Filaret suddenly announced that I could not serve with the 
bishops of the UAPTs. That is, those that had received and saved 
him! Then I had to threaten that I would not only come, but that 
I would also report who he in fact was--an ordinary monk. 
Filaret, as you know, by the way, had not yet left the 
jurisdiction of the Moscow patriarchate. This, I think, is some 
latest bit of cunning of his, and there is something behind it. 
  The deputies now began to pressure Filaret. He boasted, go 
ahead, let him call the President, but all the same consented 
first to serving at the prayer service, and then the liturgy as 
well. That is how the infamous unification occurred. It was, of 
course, not legitimate. Our synod, if you go by the charter and 
the canons, was not legitimate. It did not lead to a 
unification, but rather to an even greater schism. And Filaret 
and his deputies are to blame for it. Without them we would have 
long ago found common tongue with both Metropolitan Vladimir 
(Sabodan) and with world Orthodoxy. I have always had great 
respect for both the UAPTs and for Vladimir Yarena (today UAPTs 
Patriarch Dimitriy I.--V.A.). The Orthodox would have 
lost all their cathedrals in Western Ukraine if there had been 
no UAPTs, thanks to which Orthodoxy was preserved in those lands. 
  [V. Anisimov] But the synod "decided to consider" Mstislav 
as 
patriarch of the UPTs-KP, and Filaret as his deputy. What were 
the relations between them? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] None whatsoever. You understand for 
whose sake that was done. The Patriarch could not stand Filaret. 
I feel great guilt before Mstislav, who did a great deal of good 
for me even though I acted against his will... There was nothing 
for me to fear then, of course--go on a boycott. But how could I 
act against, as the deputies asserted, the will of the 
President? Having come with Filaret from Constantinople, we 
should have gone to Mstislav. The deputies, after all, presented 
the patriarch with an ultimatum: either you accept Filaret, or 
you stay in complete isolation. Mstislav was staying at the 
Zhovtneva Hotel at the time, and immediately asked, where is 
Antoniy? I was of course afraid to go to him, but I went. I 
explained everything, I told him of the President's request, and 
he answered, this clears up the picture somewhat, but you 
deserve to be punished all the same. I prevailed upon him to 
accept Filaret, and he refused point-blank. Chervoniy, 
Porovskiy, Skorik came by to see him--for naught. Mstislav 
finally softened: he is not against unification, he said, but 
what does he need this "deputy" for, that people are laughing at 
around the world? Only before his departure was Mstislav 
compelled to accept Filaret--they spoke one on one for about 
fifteen minutes. When leaving, the patriarch asked that he be 
escorted without Filaret. But Filaret went to Borispol all the 
same. Their meetings were thus always forced. There was simply 
nowhere for Mstislav to go, even though he could not abide 
either Filaret or Romanyuk. 
  [V. Anisimov] But why Romanyuk? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] I do not know, perhaps because of the 
undignified behavior of Romanyuk in confinement, there were 
stories about him, or perhaps hostility that had arisen back in 
America had an effect. The patriarch clapped me on the shoulder 
one day and said, "If you want to be my friend, do not mention 
Romanyuk to me any more." Romanyuk was in general under some 
kind of hypnosis from Filaret; even now, as the patriarch, he 
blindly does everything he is ordered. 
  [V. Anisimov] But why first a locum tenens, and 
then namely he elected patriarch? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] When Mstislav died, it suddenly 
became 
clear that Filaret wouldn't mind taking his place. Zinchenko, it 
seemed to me, did not object to that either. I thus had to state 
bluntly to the "sullied" claimant: you cannot be a locum 
tenens, since Western Ukraine would break away from us 
immediately. The faithful and the higher clergy, after all, 
could tolerate him as a bishop but in no way consider him a 
leader. Filaret never goes to Lvov or Ternopol. The election of 
Romanyuk was the sole way out of the situation to preserve the 
unity of the UPTs-KP. The deputies nonetheless undertook a 
mighty attempt, at the synod, to drag Filaret in as a candidate 
for patriarch. Chervoniy, Porovskiy, Skorik et al. 
were solidly behind him. I do not want to whitewash the 
communist regime, the plenipotentiaries and so on, but I will 
say frankly that even the communists did not interfere in the 
internal affairs of the church, they did not exert any pressure 
on it. Chervoniy stood at one microphone and Porovskiy at the 
other at the synod, as if at a session of parliament, and 
started a cross fire. Only the d&eacute;marche of the former 
UAPTs 
bishops (we left the hall) kept them from shoving Filaret into 
the patriarchy. They then decided to deal with me at the synod. 
Only the protection of Romanyuk, just elected patriarch (he 
threatened to pass his patriarch's cowl to the people's 
deputies) curbed their zeal. The call of Zhulinskiy, who said 
that all--both Romanyuk and I--should remain in their places, 
perhaps also played a role. 
  [V. Anisimov] And can a state of affairs be deemed normal 
when the deputies run the church, and calls come from the 
President indicating who should stay in what places? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] That is normal here in Ukraine. The 
intervention of forces outside the church into church affairs 
has crossed all boundaries. The deputies, Zinchenko--they are 
constant guests of Filaret, they sit in on holy synods and 
essentially run the church, giving commands to the higher 
clergy. Zinchenko could even order, say, archbishop Spiridon 
removed from Vinnitsa. Filaret is also supported by the "power 
structures"--he is a friend of Nedrigaylo, and an even greater 
one of Boris Tabachek, a superior of the Vladimir synod. The 
police, together with the Filaret people, undertake 
storm-trooper type acts against the Kiev-Pechorskaya monastery. 
  The misfortune of Christianity in Ukraine in general is the 
fact that various political forces have seeped into the church, 
and each is trying to use its influence on people for its own 
ends. The church was not able to dissociate itself from them in 
time. As a result the UAPTs has its own politicians, and the 
UPTs-KP has its own. This is a tragedy. If all denominations 
were to assemble and say, that's enough, let the politicians 
engage in politics, the church has its own purpose--to go to the 
hospitals, schools, prisons, almshouses, children's homes--then 
the church would not be split into pieces, and the stances of 
the conflicting sides today would move closer together. That is 
just why I left the UPTs-KP: I do not want to be the screen 
behind which someone's political capital is accumulated. I 
signed some piece of paper at one time for Levka Lukyanenko. 
Today Chervoniy, Skorik, Porovskiy, Zinchenko etc. need the 
UPTs-KP first and foremost. 
  [V. Anisimov] You are saying very harsh things. You would 
agree that faith is an intimate matter. To get into the souls of 
people, to provoke a schism of the Orthodox for the sake of some 
"political capital," is just too cynical. 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] You see, they will again be put 
forward for parliament according to the districts where they 
have seized the cathedrals, where the UPTs-KP has support among 
the population. Take Ternopolskiy, as far as I know he is being 
put forward from Ternopol Oblast... Why, say, are Chervoniy or 
Porovskiy not going to Eastern Ukraine? This same Porovskiy, 
after all, worked a great deal in Crimea on its Ukrainization. 
Why doesn't he stand there? They even lie to their own voters. 
Chervoniy, for example, knows that the Rivne area does not 
support Filaret. And after the synod, coming to Rivne, he says 
to the faithful face to face, you know I voted for Romanyuk at 
the synod, but archbishop of Rivne Roman supported Filaret. That 
was to discredit the higher clergy in the eyes of the people. 
That is even though I will testify that everything was the other 
way around--it was precisely Chervoniy himself who insisted on 
the candidacy of Filaret. Our tragedy is the fact that 
non-church people have attached themselves to the church. They 
have nowhere else to go. Both Porovskiy and Chervoniy are former 
Komsomol workers, and Zinchenko, as far as I know, got through 
the elections in Vinnitsa Oblast on the democratic platform of 
the CPSU. The situation changes, what can they do? They wisely 
decide to head for the church. And if they had come to the 
church with pure feelings, with repentance, that would have been 
noteworthy. But they came in order to rule once more, and to 
foist their own foolish policies onto the church. I am not sure 
that any of them has even read the Bible at all. And the 
people's deputies have given the churchmen a thankless role: 
exploiting the patriotic feelings of the faithful, creating a 
base for the elections by deft parliamentary maneuverings. I am 
thus convinced that to remain in this church and lie to the 
faithful is a great sin. Filaret receives humanitarian 
assistance from the former army of the GDR, he clothes and shods 
the Cossacks of Chervoniy, and they storm the cathedrals for 
Filaret--there's a good example of mutual support for you. It is 
not for nothing that Porovskiy has somehow flattered the 
all-powerful Filaret--how I used to hate you, he says! But now I 
am ready to get on my knees before you. 
  [V. Anisimov] And what about UPTs-KP Patriarch Vladimir 
(Romanyuk)? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] He has no support among the bishops 
with our departure. And Filaret rules the ball. According to 
information that is still unverified, he is doing everything to 
drive Romanyuk to drink. 
  [V. Anisimov] But it is no secret, after all, that Romanyuk 
loved to drink even when a bishop, is it? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] Unfortunately. But he had a heart 
problem after the events in Lutsk, and he limited his use of 
spirits. I am for some reason convinced that Romanyuk is 
leaving. I respect him as a person who has been persecuted, and 
I think that he does not want to dance to Filaret's tune for 
very long. 
  [V. Anisimov] So then why does the UNSO support Romanyuk? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] I must honestly admit that I do not 
know, although Romanyuk really does have a great deal of 
influence on it. 
  [V. Anisimov] But after all, you also took part in seizing 
cathedrals, for example in Ternopol? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] I am not guilty of the events in 
Ternopol, I give you my word. I was talking with the bishops and 
clergy at the church when Chervoniy gave the command to the 
Cossacks to seize the home of UPTs bishop Sergey. First he 
appeared before the clergy with a proposal to organize a 
Ternopol Cossack host and announce a collection of funds for 
those purposes. Then he went to Sergey, where there were a 
bookkeeper, guard and domestics. Then the Cossacks stood up for 
the ataman himself. The forces were unequal, and after a small 
skirmish the Cossacks drove everyone from the gates. Chervoniy 
sent a courier to the autocephalous clergy: come and lend a 
hand, he said, we are taking the house for you. I wanted to go 
there at once, but my car was blocked. I think that was a 
planned provocation against me by Chervoniy, so as to portray me 
as a terrorist: wherever Antoniy appears, there is a battle 
immediately. The next day the building was returned to the UPTs. 
  [V. Anisimov] How many parishes are there in the UPTs-KP in 
Ukraine today? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] One and a half thousand. This is an 
influential organization only in Western Ukraine. If the Kiev 
diocese, which numbers some hundred active parishes (another 
hundred on paper), leaves the UPTs-KP, then Filaret's church 
will simply cease to exist. I feel that a house built on sand 
will not last long. Falsehoods and lies will out all the same. 
This church will inevitably disintegrate. 
  [V. Anisimov] So why have you not returned to the UAPTs or 
not gone to the UPTs, like the other bishops? 
  [Metropolitan Antoniy] I studied at a seminary of the 
Russian 
Orthodox Church, and served as a clergyman in it for ten 
years... I returned to the canonical church, far from Filaret 
and his intrigues and provocations. I feel that Ukraine will 
have its own autocephalous, canonical Orthodox church, and that 
will be the UPTs of Metropolitan Sabodan. The church should be 
with the people, and if the people have come out for 
independence, then their church should also move toward 
independence.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Prytula, Simferopol: "Emigration of </F>
the Crimean Government"] 
  [Text] The winds of election campaigns have been 
blowing throughout Crimea. There has been no abatement of the 
hurly-burly caused by the election of a Crimean president to 
take charge of this peninsula. Jostling one another are long 
lists of candidates for the Ukrainian parliament and the Crimean 
Supreme Council; these elections are scheduled to take place all 
on one day--27 March 1994. "Our own elections are closer to our 
hearts." That is the opinion expressed by most of this 
peninsula's inhabitants, who react only faintly to the 
respectable portraits of those Crimean candidates who have 
ventured to run for the Ukrainian Supreme Council. 
  Nevertheless, 118 candidates have been registered in the 19 
Crimean election districts. Another 30 candidates are on the 
lists of the election districts in Sevastopol, which has 
traditionally stood aloof from Simferopol, even when it is a 
matter concerning elections. A particular feature of the present 
election process is its semi-boycott by the organized 
pro-Russian forces, which have put up their own candidates in 
only a few districts. However, the Crimean Communist Party did 
send its stalwarts into all the Crimean election districts. To 
be sure, there is not a single one of them whose name is known 
even in the neighboring rayon. The first secretary of the KPK 
[Crimean Communist Party], Leonid Hrach, and the remaining party 
leaders consider it better to be on the ballot for the Supreme 
Council of this autonomous republic. Aside for some faithful 
Leninists from the KPK-KPU [Ukrainian Communist Party], Crimeans 
will see on their election ballots quite a few names of 
candidates put up by the Crimean Federation of Independent Trade 
Unions; their views and make-up are very similar to those of the 
communist comrades. 
  The Crimean organizations of three other political parties 
have put up their own candidates: the Ukrainian Republican 
Party, the Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine, and the 
Party for the Economic Rebirth of Crimea. This last party has 
All-Ukrainian status. The Republicans have formed a bloc in 
these elections with the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea, 
which has regional structures in all the cities and rayons of 
this peninsula. The leader of the Congress, Serhiy Lytvyn, is on 
the ballot in Simferopol Rayon; the head of the Crimean URP 
[Ukrainian Republican Party], Professor Oleksandr Fedorenko, is 
running in the Kiev Rayon of Simferopol; and the deputy chief of 
the UGKK [Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea], Professor Petro 
Volvach, is on the ballot in the city of Saki. Realistically 
speaking, the URP-UGKK bloc can count on victory for two or 
three of its candidates--something which--in the opinion of the 
URP and Congress leaders--could be considered a success. 
  Among other more or less well-known local political figures 
in this peninsula who have a chance of winning is Vladyslav 
Khmylovskyy--head of the Crimean Civic Forum. He is on the 
ballot in Simferopol's Zaliznychyy District. He is opposed there 
by the RDK [Crimean Republican Movement] activist and Crimean 
people's deputy, Hennadiy Chernysh. The co-chairman of the Party 
for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine's Crimean Section, 
Volodymyr Polyakov, is registered in the Central Election 
District. Among his rivals is the present Ukrainian people's 
deputy, writer, and RDK member, Volodymyr Terekhov. It is 
interesting that of the present-day deputies to the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council, except for Terekhov, only two have risked being 
on the ballot: Hennadiy Vaneyev in Sevastopol and Volodymyr 
Sevastyanov in Simferopol. Yuriy Koltsov has registered in 
Feodosiya; he is a former USSR deputy and now is an activist of 
the Association for Support of the Crimean Republic. 
  In the opinion of local observers, all the above-mentioned 
persons have only fair-to-middling chances of making it to the 
Ukrainian parliament. Each of them could be circumvented and 
beaten out by some director of a state enterprise. And there are 
several such candidates in each and every election district. 
  Among the favorites are those ministers of the Crimean 
government for whom the victory of Yuriy Meshkov in the 
presidential election drastically cut down the possibilities of 
scampering off to Kiev. The chairman of the autonomous 
republic's Council of Ministers, Borys Samsonov, was gratefully 
nominated by his fellow-townsmen in Dzhanka. The people of 
Krasnoperekopsk will see on their ballots the name of Heorhiy 
Kapchuk--the administrator of affairs for the Crimean 
government. He is a person already well-known for losing his 
position in 1991 as deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme 
Council because of his too-active sympathy for the GKChP [State 
Committee for Emergency Measures]. In other districts several 
Crimean ministers are also on the ballot--ministers who have 
already fallen between two stools. 
  There are only 6 Crimean Tatars among the 150 or so 
contenders for deputies' seats. They are all on the ballots as 
independents of parties or movements. But--as I was informed by 
the deputy head of the mejlis, Refat Chubarov--they are 
supported by the representative organ of the Crimean Tatar 
people. It is hardly likely, however, that any of the Crimean 
Tatars will make it to the Ukrainian parliament. And 
this--according to Chubarov--will provide grounds for talking 
about a representation of the Crimean Tatar people in the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council.

<F P=106> [Report by Svitlana Synyakova under the "Election Marathon" </F>
rubric: "Failure is the Mother of Success"] 
  [Text] 
  In its desire to unite representatives of various 
political forces, even if during a round table discussion, the 
VECHERNIY KYYIV editorial board, unfortunately, has not achieved 
full gratification. Certain leaders did not come, having used 
the struggle for deputy seats as an excuse. However, they have 
promised to send their representatives. Aides of certain 
leaders have also promised to come. But, as is usual with us, 
we have to wait for the blue moon to see them coming. 
  Did election battles really drain all strength from 
political organizations up to the last man in the ranks? Or, 
perhaps, is the very idea of unity of Ukrainian brothers 
becoming unrealistic during the harsh competition in the 
electoral districts? Or, perhaps, do atamans' ambitions prevent 
them from meeting at peace talks? 
  Whatever the reason, one should not lose sight of that 
undeniable fact that Ukraine approaches the loss of its 
independence. 
  Wise people learn from others' mistakes. Smart people 
-- from their own. Who are we: the wise? the smart? Or, have 
we learnt nothing at all? 
  Maybe, a multiparty system is to blame? 
  This supposition was expressed by Vitaliy Karpenko 
[VECHERNIY 
KYYIV editor in chief] for starters. In his opinion, Ukraine 
has always been ruined by animosity and treachery. It was 
animosity that did not allow the Supreme Council to 
legislatively consolidate independence by outlawing all those 
encroaching upon it. 
  Maybe, were there only Rukh, the question would have been 
settled? However, according to Levko Lukyanenko [leader of the 
"Ukrayina" election bloc], the emergence of numerous political 
organizations is a normal phenomenon. It is enough to remember 
the compulsory unanimity that holds our entire society in a 
tight grip. Even in 1988, when the Communist Party officially 
announced democratization, very few attended the Ukrainian 
Culture Club [Ukrayinskyy Kulturolohichnyy Klyub]. Later on, as 
the number of clubs increased, there were still very few who 
dared to join the Helsinki Committee, because the participants 
in it were persecuted by the authorities. At the same time, 
joining the Association of Ukrainian Language did not pose any 
difficulties. 
  However, there existed a unity at that time. Rukh was born 
of that unity. The unity was declared by the delegates of 
Rukh's Constituent Congress. If it has been lost, then what is 
the reason for that? Are ambitions to blame? 
  However, according to Levko Lukyanenko, the 1991 
presidential 
elections were affected not by ambitions, but by serious program 
differences. The Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] was for a 
unitary Ukraine, while Vyacheslav Chornovil -- for a federative 
one; the URP supported one official language, while Vyacheslav 
Chornovil was not opposed to two. 
  As a result, both Lukyanenko and Chornovil have lost. The 
majority of electors voted for Kravchuk who, by the way, was not 
backed by any party at that time. He was backed only by his 
real power. 
  Is it a surprise then that splits and discords have become 
our common characteristics? As the ancients would say: divide 
et impera. 
  In the meantime, on the turn of 1991-92, democrats were able 
to pressure the party in power and force quick reforms. 
However, they did not press. 
  What was the mistake? 
  Yuriy Hnatkevich believes that one mistake is to be afraid 
of 
not the large number of parties, but of their fighting one 
another. "We are united by three ideas -- independence, 
democracy, and market reforms, whereas the splits have been 
caused by accents." 
  "Accents," in his opinions, have been laid in the fact that 
Larysa Skoryk [of National Rukh of Ukraine] staked on "them," 
believing the nomenklatura to be the most organized force 
capable of building the state. At the same time, Vyacheslav 
Chornovil believed it necessary to form an opposition to "them." 
Life has tested Chornovil's correctness. 
  Today, it seems, there are no disagreements on this issue. 
Mr. Losiv from the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine is 
even prone to think that there should be no dealings with 
Communists at all, because it is they who allow party activities 
on Ukrainian territory, which openly admit that their purpose is 
to destroy independence. 
  However, this does not relieve democrats of their guilt, 
either. 
  "Democrats have made many concessions," pointed out Levko 
Lukyanenko, "and have gotten a peace of stagnation, which 
threatens Ukraine's independence." 
  The price for this peace was evaluated by Kostyantyn Morozov 
[former defense minister]. He specified the concessions which 
should be withdrawn by the most patriotic authorities provided 
that they win the elections: nonnuclear status, transfer of 
Black Sea Fleet structures to the Defense Ministry of the 
Russian Federation, Crimean autonomy, the dragging of Ukraine 
into the so-called economic union and the single ruble zone, 
transparent borders, two official languages, the loss of 
Ukraine's own political face on the international arena, 
censorship and control over the freedom of speech, the lack of 
unity... 
  A high price. And it was paid not by political divergencies 
among national democratic forces [as published], but by the 
situation, in which, after the declaration of Ukraine's 
independence, the building of statehood was entrusted to the 
Supreme Council completed in the elections that were organized 
by the Communist Party of Ukraine. The Communist Party -- in a 
manner becoming the ruling party -- took care of its worthy 
representation in the highest legislative body. The party 
carefully selected its Supreme Council cadres which were apt to 
defend the state ownership and a single Union as well. After 
August 1991, these people were given the right to work on the 
creation of a market economy and to form the Armed Forces of the 
independent state as well as its military policy. "We know how 
they have done it," Kostyantyn Morozov stated. "All the 
governments were working in this channel." 
  Will the elections be a cold shower? 
  The idea of unity seems so simple and evident that ordinary 
readers, not very familiar with party developments, ask us: Are 
they going to unite themselves, or not? 
  Therefore, one can agree with Mr. Pawlyuk who stated: "The 
idea of unity is not dead yet." 
  Ihor Nayda from the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, 
who sees the situation from the inside due to being an 
authorized representative of a candidate in one of the Kiev 
constituencies, does not share the opinion that such a unity is 
possible just now. But "in principle" -- why not? 
  All the democrats have much in common in their programs and 
election platforms. These common matters can become a basis for 
convening a unity congress which would put forward only one 
presidential candidate representing all national democratic 
forces. 
  Thus far, such a proposal has not raised anyone's 
objections. 
  Indeed, the legislative elections may become a cold shower, 
in which certain party atamans are lacking so badly. Then they 
could be prompted to a realistic evaluation of themselves and 
their political abilities. 
  However, for the time being, events are following their own 
course. The head of the Kiev Regional Organization of the 
Ukrainian Republican Party, Volodymyr Kuziv, who participated in 
listing the approved candidates for Kiev city and oblast, 
acknowledges: "We have already lost a fifth of the votes 
without even entering the election campaign. Unity is 
necessary. However, how can one unite something that cannot be 
united?" It is, perhaps, not incidental that Levko Lukyanenko 
also emphasized that the democratic bloc "Ukrayina" will not 
firmly cling to certain candidacies that proved to be very 
low-level, and to make corrections to avoid failures. 
  Personal ambitions are being abandoned by those who 
understand the following: If the elections in the majority of 
Ukraine's constituencies do not choose people's deputies, the 
party in power will easily introduce a dictatorship. This will 
be the time to validate the saying by one Ukrainian politician: 
"Our democrats will be united -- five minutes before the 
execution."

<F P=106> [Interview with Pavlo Lazarenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk </F>
Oblast State Administration, by Mykola Makarenko in 
Dnipropetrovsk; date not given: "Pavlo Lazarenko: `The Regional 
Experiment -- Ukraine's Chance for Survival'" -- first four 
paragraphs are HOLOS UKRAYINA introduction] 
  [Text] The idea of regional self-government, which has long 
hovered over the Dnieper region, is now taking on a concrete 
form. A presidential edict issued on 26 November 1993 granted 
the state administrations of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, 
Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk oblasts authority to manage 
state-owned property. An experiment was initiated to create a 
kind of economic and legal zone capable of functioning quite 
independently. 
  One would have thought that this arrangement would benefit 
everybody. The government would no longer be saddled with 
concern and responsibility for the situation in the country's 
most troublesome and tense region, and the local leadership 
would finally be given the opportunity to operate freely in 
market conditions. 
  But the attempts of the regional administrations to bring 
the 
policies of ministries and departments into conformity with the 
president's edict do not always enjoy support from the center. 
  What does this first experiment in economic self-government 
in Ukraine actually entail? We asked P.I. Lazarenko, the head of 
the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration, to tell us about 
this undertaking. 
  [Lazarenko] The only thing that the leaders of the four 
oblasts wanted was to join efforts in assuring rational and 
mutually advantageous management. Especially as in some fields, 
even heretofore, our oblasts were very dependent on one another. 
  The Donetsk-Dnieper region relies on a common energy 
potential. In addition to the metallurgical branch, the Donbas 
supplies the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhya thermal electric 
power stations with coal, while the power these stations produce 
is sufficient to meet the needs of other oblasts as well. 
Integration in machine-building will also be very productive: 
the region's enterprises complement one another wonderfully. We 
are already cooperating in the production of a feed-harvesting 
combine. We have the "Ukrainian Automobile" program and many 
other, very promising ideas. In a situation in which the economy 
is collapsing, if we ourselves do not see to it that these ideas 
are implemented, no one else will. 
  As you can see, the creation of a common economic space is 
not something that began today; life itself has forced us to 
seek out new ways to cooperate. All we need to do is bring to a 
logical conclusion a process that began a long time ago. It is 
particularly important to do so now that the integration of 
oblasts has been secured by the president's edict. 
  [Makarenko] Did not a similar territorial-economic division 
during the period of the national economic councils prove 
ineffective? 
  [Lazarenko] I would not take such a categorical stand on the 
councils of national economy. They had their shortcomings, but 
they also had their advantages. It was not mere chance that in 
the seven and a half years that they existed, the rates of 
growth attained in industry, agriculture, and the social sphere 
were higher than those achieved in the 25 years since the 
introduction of the branch system of management. 
  Today's experiment also promises a lot. That we wasted time 
in starting this experiment and did not manage to settle the 
issue of regional ownership by the beginning of this year is 
another matter. But the blame for this lies with individual 
ministries, which failed to understand the point of the 
experiment, as well as the president's edict. Suffice it to say 
that although the edict came into force on 26 November 1993, the 
drafts of the normative acts needed to regulate its 
implementation were not submitted for review to the Ministry of 
the Economy until 30 December. Small wonder that the new 
economic conditions in which we are beginning to live are now at 
variance with acting legislation. 
  To be sure, it is not all that difficult to bring all the 
legal acts into conformity -- this is only a matter of time. The 
worst of it is that the fundamental principles on which the 
entire, well thought-out concept of egional self-government is 
structured are being eviscerated as this concept makes its way 
through the various ministerial offices. 
  [Makarenko] Pavlo Ivanovych, you must agree that one can 
understand the ministries in this situation. The Donetsk-Dnieper 
region accounts for the lion's share of the revenues that flow 
into departmental pockets, especially from such branches as 
metallurgy, mining, and the power industry. If the basic 
enterprises are handed over to the region, and they ultimately 
demonstrate that they can manage perfectly well without the 
center, will this not give rise to the question whether there is 
any need as such for the ministries as we know them today? This 
is a real delayed-action mine for them. 
  [Lazarenko] It is very likely that many at the departmental 
level perceive our initiative in just such terms. But I believe 
that the interests of the people and of the state must take 
precedence over all else. 
  Can anything other than personal ambition explain the 
following? The list of 857 enterprises proposed by us for 
transferring into regional ownership was "cut" by the ministries 
by more than half -- to 365. Moreover, the principle according 
to which the selection was made defies all logic. 
  For example, the Ministry of Industry left a number of 
ferrous and nonferrous metallurgical enterprises, 
scientific-research, and planning and design organizations on 
the list, while removing enterprises in the metal products, ore 
mining, and coke and chemical subbranch. This, despite the fact 
that even a nonspecialist understands that these are components 
of a single metallurgical complex. 
  Enterprises specializing in gas and oil and coal extraction 
were left off the list completely, as were all transportation 
and communications enterprises. Of 31 enterprises within the 
Ministry of Power system, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast got all of... 
six, although we asked that the three latter branches be 
included in the experiment with a double subordination. 
  The managers of the republic's building industry also ruined 
our plans. At the request of the Ukrmontazhspetsbud, Ukrtsement, 
Ukrprombud, and Ukravtodor corporations, not a single enterprise 
in the oblast subordinated to them will be handed over. The 
building complex "generously" gave us 33 of the 139 enterprises 
we asked for. 
  [Makarenko] This situation reminds me of the well-known 
saying: "Here, God, you take what I have no use for..." 
  [Lazarenko] Yes, but only at first glance. After all, it is 
not as if we wanted to take over only the large and strong 
enterprises and not want to bother with the unprofitable ones. 
The whole point of the experiment is to make both strong and 
weak enterprises part of a single economic space and subordinate 
them not to a department, but to a common objective --either 
cooperation through joint production, or a long-term building 
program. 
  Is it so important to us who runs an enterprise as long as 
it 
operates and provides people with jobs and the state with 
revenues? They just introduced a clause into the decree of the 
Cabinet of Ministers which forbids changing the product 
specialization of enterprises. Does this mean that a plant that 
manufactures products for which there is no demand should die?! 
Shut down?! Where is the common sense in this? 
  [Makarenko] How many such contradictions are there in the 
Cabinet of Ministers documents that regulate the implementation 
of the edict? 
  [Lazarenko] Many, unfortunately. In addition to cutting up 
the list of enterprises to suit itself, the Cabinet of Ministers 
has also drafted a decree on the procedure for managing 
enterprises, institutions, and organizations by the state 
administrations, which contravenes effective legislation. After 
all, all these questions were regulated back in 1992 by the 
Cabinet of Ministers decree "On Managing State-Owned Property," 
and no one has revoked this decree. And the Ministry of the 
Economy has still not gottten around to reviewing our proposals 
regarding other normative acts, without which it is impossible 
to pursue an effective economic policy in the region. 
  [Makarenko] What is the gist of the proposals of the 
Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration? 
  [Lazarenko] We requested that the draft of the decree 
include 
a clause establishing a regional order for production as part of 
the state order, as well as allowing the oblast administrations 
to issue export quotas and licenses as part of the same regional 
order in order to enable us to effectively resolve socioeconomic 
problems. Unless this is done, it is virtually impossible to 
regulate price formation and satisfy the region's need for 
imported goods. 
  Second, the acts that have been drafted so far are clearly 
inadequate to ensure that the regional economy functions in a 
normal and full-fledged anner. In these new economic conditions, 
it is imperative to regulate the credit and financial policies 
of banks, develop mechanisms for settlement clearing with CIS 
members for deliveries of raw materials, fuel and energy 
resources, and equipment, and stipulate in greater detail the 
procedure for managing state-owned property. 
  Until all these documents are completed and approved, any 
positive changes in the region's economy are out of the question. 
  In light of this situation, the president of Ukraine was 
forced to issue another edict on 21 February 1994 "On Additional 
Measures With Respect to Delegating Powers to the 
Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk Oblast State 
Administrations To Manage State-Owned Property." The edict is 
well thought-out and tough. It takes into account the needs of 
the region. After all, Ukraine does not live and work in the 
capital, but in the regions. The edict provides for export 
quotas, for the right to act as guarantor for foreign 
investment, and many other necessary things. Essentially, this 
second edict says to the officials in Kiev quite unequivocally 
that Ukraine does not exist to serve them, but that they exist 
to serve Ukraine, and that it is not up to them to accumulate 
everything into their own hands and then disburse it. I hope 
that the officials will get the right message and not attempt to 
continue trying the president's patience... 
  [Makarenko] In other words, as in any other field, the 
purity 
of an experiment in economics must also be assured? 
  [Lazarenko] Absolutely. This experiment will make sense only 
if the Cabinet of Ministers executes all the nuances of this 
large-scale and unquestionably promising undertaking. On the 
other hand, I feel that our government simply does not have the 
choice whether to conduct this experiment or not. There are two 
presidential edicts, and, most important, we are now in a 
situation that threatens us with the collapse of the economy and 
a social explosion. All well thought-out proposals for 
tabilizing the economy -- be it in the republic or in a region 
-- must find support today. We are counting on the government to 
take this sober view of the situation. 
  There is also a need to review our taxation policy. I will 
give you an example. Last year, our oblast transferred 220 
billion karbovantsi into the Chernobyl fund and got back a mere 
two billion. Meanwhile, 26,600 participants in the liquidation 
of the accident at the Chernobyl AES reside in Dnipropetrovsk 
Oblast, and the oblast still has no rehabilitation center for 
them. Next. The State Property Fund "made" 58 billion 
karbovantsi on privatizing enterprises in our oblast last year. 
I feel that 50 percent of the income from privatization of state 
enterprises should be left at the disposal of the region. 
  In working out the taxation policy, at least one rule should 
be adhered to: do not kill the chicken that lays the golden 
eggs. Otherwise there will be nothing left to transfer into the 
budget.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Korchynskyy, leader of the Ukrainian </F>
National Self Defense, by Vitaliy Markovskyy in Kiev; date not 
given: "Hemingway Would Definitely Be Sentenced According to 
Ukrainian Law" -- first paragraph is UKRAYINA MOLODA 
introduction published in boldface; questions published in 
boldface] 
  [Text] Downtown Kiev, the favorite place for many offices 
and headquarters... I head straight for an unremarkable -- 
especially against the backdrop of a white-stone bank office -- 
small building. The door opens. They gaze at me suspiciously 
and, passing through another metal-bar door, I am escorted to 
the basement -- the headquarters of the Ukrainian National 
Assemble [UNA] and the Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNSO]. 
A tiny room. An ashtray with cigarette stubs stands on a 
table. A portrait of Stepan Bandera [leader of the 
Organizations of Ukrainian Nationalists during World War II], 
maps of Kiev and Abkhasia, and a picture of Hemingway toting a 
machine gun hang on the wall (the motto reads: "Hemingway would 
definitely be sentenced to 12 years in prison if he was a 
Ukrainian citizen, for participating in the Spanish Civil War") 
Somebody looks at me suspiciously, somebody is intimidated, the 
majority do not care at all. UNSO leader Dmytro Korchynskyy 
gives me a sign, and I turn on my tape recorder: 
  [Markovskyy] The unforgettable Oscar Wilde used to say that 
although people do not like it when somebody speaks about them 
too much, they like it even less when somebody does not speak 
about them at all. Mr. Dmytro, although I am not sure about 
your influence, you are a well-known force in Ukraine's 
political arena. Nevertheless, I would like to hear directly 
from you: Who are you? 
  [Korchynskyy] The UNSO was established on 19 August 1991 to 
sabotage a coup attempt in our country. At that time, the UNA 
initiated the first UNSO units that were already conducting 
appropriate work and training. Since then, the organization has 
been reinforced and has gained some combat experience. This is 
the only organization in Ukraine that has administrative, 
political, and military experience obtained under the conditions 
of destabilization and serious social conflicts. Participation 
in two wars, dozens of strikes, work in the Army, establishment 
of a servicemen's union, and social protection of workers are 
the results of our activities.... All the other so-called 
political parties deal with some shady business. 
  [Markovskyy] Your are often deemed ultra-radicals, or just 
plain ultras. Moreover, your activities are basically illegal. 
What is your opinion on such attitudes expressed toward your 
organization, and what is UNSO's place in Ukraine's political 
arena? 
  [Korchynskyy] Voltaire once noted that an adequate reaction 
to reality and telling the truth is always considered by society 
as extremism. The most extremist aspect of our activities is 
that we call things by their names and react adequately. A 
healthy reaction in unhealthy society is considered extremism. 
The UNSO reacts to current events. At the beginning we defend, 
and later we try to figure out what we have defended. There is 
solidarity among us. Our organization unites people who are 
convinced that the outmost houses burn first, and people who are 
nonconformists, tired of waiting for someone to spit in their 
face in their own country. They strike in response. I believe 
that this is quite normal. 
  [Markovskyy] How many members does the UNSO have? 
  [Korchynskyy] Not many. There are only several thousand 
people. However, we have the best capabilities to mobilize our 
members among all parties. All Ukrainian parties have 
relatively few members, but when there is a need, when a certain 
number of people is needed at a certain place, the UNSO is the 
best. 
  [Markovskyy] We have seen everything in Ukraine, except 
for... war, and God forbid this happens. Many people link your 
organization with the avenging sword, military uniforms, and 
combat.... Are you a ceaselessly fighting force? War is not 
enough for you? 
  [Korchynskyy] The point is that all of East Europe has 
ended up in a situation of instability and regional conflicts, 
whether we like it or not. These conflicts surround Ukraine, 
and unfortunately, government activities may lead to a situation 
when such conflicts erupt here as well. To prevent this from 
occurring, an extremely active policy is needed. For example, 
in case conflict erupts in the Crimea, the same military units 
that were sent to Abkhazia will be deployed there -- units of 
Russia's North Caucasian Military District and Black Sea Fleet 
(the latter was pretty active in Abkhazia, where its shells 
destroyed half of Sukhumi). These are the same mercenaries who 
will be deployed against the Crimea from bases which Moscow 
fought for in Georgia. If we want to have a smaller front in 
the Crimea in the future, we have to create a bigger front in 
Caucasus to entangle certain forces in combat. This should 
become the responsibility of the Ukrainian state, since Georgia 
and Azerbaijan are in the sphere of Ukraine's geopolitical 
interests -- our national interests. The government, however, 
does not understand this, and it even brought disgrace upon 
itself allowing marines, who pledged allegiance to Ukraine, to 
fight on the side of our potential enemies, despite Kiev's 
official line. Do you understand this? It was done at 
Ukraine's expense, with Ukrainian fuel and ships. Let us look 
at another axis -- Romania -- Moldova -- Cisdnestr -- Ukraine -- 
Transcarpathia -- Hungary. Apparently, Hungary should be our 
ally, since it has serious problems with Romanians. We also 
have serious and urgent problems with Romanians in Bukovyna and 
Bessarabia. Hungary, however, seeing the sluggishness and 
passiveness of Ukraine, began very active work aimed at 
Transcarpathia's secession a few years ago. The so-called 
Ruthenian movement is financed by Hungary, and the Ruthenian 
leaders are of Hungarian origin. In the current situation, 
Ukraine must conduct an active policy, it must. 
  [Markovskyy] What is your combat experience? Where have you 
fought, and what were the results of this? Why did you do that? 
  [Korchynskyy] Officially, we have participated in two 
military conflicts: in Cisdnestr and Abkhazia. The decision to 
take part in the first conflict was obvious to us, since 
Cisdnestr is an ethnically Ukrainian land inhabited primarily by 
Ukrainians. Additionally, we know that rapprochement between 
Moldova and Romania is under way. It is also known that the 
Ukrainian ethnic minority has always been discriminated against 
in Romania. If Moldova unites with Romania, we can expect a 
similar attitude toward the Ukrainians living in Cisdnestr. We 
should be aware that Ukraine cannot be indifferent toward 
Cisdnestr. The more so, since as long as Moldova has problems 
with Cisdnestr, we will not have problems with Bukovyna and 
Bessarabia. We believe that the concept of "a war in our own 
backyard," which Ukrainians have been endorsing for more than 
300 years, is erroneous. It is too late to fight when the enemy 
is already in your backyard. One must wage a war on foreign 
soil. However, the point was not a war. Ukraine had to show a 
human attitude toward the Ukrainians from Cisdnestr. It was 
much harder for us to make the decision on participating in the 
Abkhazian conflict. The point was that Russians fought on the 
other side in Abkhazia -- both regular units and volunteers. We 
endorse the idea of Slavic unity, and we do not like to shoot at 
Slavs. But when the situation in the Crimea had sharply 
deteriorated -- as a result of the Russian Supreme Soviet 
resolution on the status of Sevastopol -- we decided to set up a 
front in Caucasus. Unfortunately, we did not manage to 
establish an efficiently strong military force there. Our 
troops, however, were the best among the Georgian Army units, 
and they distinguished themselves in many operations. For the 
heroism demonstrated in combat, 30 UNSO troopers were awarded 
the highest military order of Georgia. 
  [Markovskyy] How many casualties did you suffer in those 
conflicts? 
  [Korchynskyy] Despite the fact that it was a very intensive 
conflict, there were no casualties in Cisdnestr on our side. We 
only had a few wounded. In Abkhazia, unfortunately, seven of 
our comrades were killed, and more than 20 wounded. I am deeply 
convinced that if there had not been these victims, we would 
have had even more casualties here, in Ukraine. Pacifism have 
elicited much more misery in our history than militarism. 
  [Markovskyy] How does the UNSO obtain their weapons? 
  [Korchynskyy] We are given weapons in conflict zones by 
governments of countries in which we fight. 
  [Markovskyy] What about Ukraine? 
  [Korchynskyy] We do not need weapons here. 
  [Markovskyy] Then, what, in your opinion, has provoked the 
authorities' recent actions against you? 
  [Korchynskyy] There has been a trend of merging the 
UNA-UNSO with strike committees, free trade unions, and social 
protection organizations. The authorities are afraid that an 
organized, solidified force is emerging in Ukraine, which can 
act as an alternative to them, restore order, and assume 
responsibility for the state and reforms. The recent change in 
the 187th article of the Criminal Code was aimed against us. It 
is interesting that this article had previously provided for 
accountability for anti-Soviet activities. Currently, it 
provides for accountability for establishing paramilitary units. 
The right to join any organization is a man's birthright. 
According to this law, it is a crime to simply establish an 
organization. Later, sport clubs and scouting camps can be 
considered "paramilitary," since they also involve discipline, 
training, uniforms -- all that relates to paramilitary units, 
according to the law. Weapons? The law does not mention 
weapons, and one does not have to possess them to be sentenced. 
Although not a single gun was found during the latest arrests, 
seven our people are serving time in Kiev. 
  [Markovskyy] What exactly happened on Bold Hill in Kiev? 
  [Korchynskyy] A documentary movie about the UNSO is 
currently being filmed. At the director's request, our people 
demonstrated their military drills. They were arrested while 
these scenes were being filmed. The director was also arrested, 
and the film was presented as "material evidence." 
  [Markovskyy] The UNSO was established in 1991. Over these 
past few years, you have been doing what you have wanted. Why 
have they cracked down on you right now? 
  [Korchynskyy] Primarily, because our organization is getting 
stronger. Whereas we have not been taken seriously before, now, 
the regime considers us its main enemy. Second, the regime has 
had certain illusions about using us in its battle against trade 
unions and strikers. Do not forget that this regime is young -- 
before 1991, they were nothing more than snitches. The regime 
has grown stronger and richer. Every day brings them tens of 
millions of dollars -- they have enough money to both waste and 
fight for. 
  [Markovskyy] I have heard that the UNSO was established by 
the authorities as sort of scarecrow: Look, this is the monster 
of Ukrainian nationalism. Take a look and be scared. The fact 
that this monster exists allows the Security Service to tightly 
control national-democratic forces in Ukraine. 
  [Korchynskyy] One must follow current events. Those who 
have recently been doing that should notice that our activities 
are dangerous and uncomfortable for the authorities, including 
the Ukrainian Security Service. As of today, more than 20 of 
our comrades are imprisoned as a result of numerous 
fabrications. Many of them have experienced prisons and mortar 
fire.... People do not do such things for money. As for the 
threat to national-democratic forces... Honestly, I am 
surprised. The country is in a situation that is worse than 
occupation, the idea of statehood has been compromised, 
everything that could be robbed and sold has been robbed and 
sold, and Ukrainian patriots, state leaders, and democrats do 
not feel right. They drive fancy cars, work in luxury offices, 
and wear expensive suits.... This resembles a deadly fight with 
a lunch break, or, as if they fight against communism only twice 
a week. Apparently, this fight is very comfortable for them.... 
Our activities pose a threat only to the regime and ourselves. 
Those who are in between, are only a bluff, facade. Their 
existence is more convenient for the authorities, and I will 
explain to you why that is the case. There are basically 
several hundreds officials who form the regime, and who owe the 
main part of the capital that is being taken away from Ukraine. 
The rest is composed of small politicians and businessmen who 
get the leftovers. The average television viewer, however, 
blames not the regime but those people he sees on television. 
He watches Supreme Council debates, certain political 
parties.... All parties and political leaders try to create an 
impression that they can influence certain processes. It is 
very convenient for the authorities that, between them and 
viewers, there are certain "crawling" political parties which 
pretend that they mean something. They are the first ones to 
scream: "The democrats have ruined the country." 
  [Markovskyy] Do you intend to interfere in the developments 
in the Crimea? 
  [Korchynskyy] Of course. We have enough power to destroy 
all separatists. We, however, cannot act now, because the first 
steps are to be taken on the streets of Bankivska and 
Hrushevskoho. They will stab us in the back in Kiev, to prevent 
us from acting in the Crimea.

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Republic President Yuriy Meshkov by </F>
LITERATURNAYA GAZETA columnist Oleg Moroz; place and date not 
given: "Catastrophe in Yellow and Blue"] 
  [Text] 
  [Moroz] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, before coming to see you I 
chatted with people here in the veche square. I am happy to say 
that you still enjoy the confidence of the people. 
  [Meshkov] Does that surprise you? 
  [Moroz] I am simply asserting a fact. After all, we all know 
that following an election, as soon as a person begins work and 
gets down to real business, disillusionment sets in. Some people 
do not like one aspect, others another... 
  [Meshkov] This is natural. You have to be ready for this, 
but 
all the same you do not want to lose too much too quickly. 
Still, the situation is a great deal worse than is apparent from 
a distance. I am referring to the state of the economy, the 
state of law enforcement organs... Everything is so neglected... 
  [Moroz] It has already been reported repeatedly in the press 
that you have abandoned a number of promises you made in the 
preelection period, the most important of these being 
reunification of Crimea with Russia. Do you agree with these 
reports and the accompanying reproach? 
  [Meshkov] No, I do not. My preelection program did not refer 
to the reunification of Crimea with Russia. It referred to the 
restoration of a single economic space, cultural space, 
information space. All the rest will follow automatically. 
  [Moroz] Will a survey take place on the state status of 
Crimea? 
  [Meshkov] Yes, on 27 March. 
  [Moroz] But Kravchuk rescinded your decision to conduct it. 
  [Meshkov] Nonetheless, there will be a survey. 
  [Moroz] What will the consequences be? 
  [Meshkov] Crimea will take it into consideration. But what 
the consequences will be for Ukraine--is difficult to predict. 
Although according to sociological survey data, quite a definite 
situation is taking shape there with respect to candidates for 
the office of president of Ukraine. 
  [Moroz] But what question will be asked on the survey? The 
question--"Are you in favor of an independent Republic of Crimea 
in a union with other CIS states?" that was proposed? (this 
sounds somewhat tautological) 
  [Meshkov] Several other questions will be presented, more 
specific and more definite questions. They concern the 
preservation of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea 
and Ukraine, citizenship of the Republic of Crimea, and the 
right to dual citizenship--those provisions that were determined 
by the Constitution adopted 6 May 1992. These same provisions 
were amended 25 September of the same year in the grossest 
violations of legislation. 
  [Moroz] Do you expect any measures of confrontation on the 
part of Kiev other than the threatening warnings which 
constantly resound? How do you view the recent warning of 
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhalchenko, who stated that it 
would be better to repulse "Crimean separatism" now than find 
themselves up against the need to resort to military force later? 
  [Meshkov] As we know, the toughest traffic policemen are the 
sergeants. The higher the rank, the more lenient they are. It is 
just about the same way in the state apparatus. What 
confrontation measures do we expect? In my opinion they have 
already been taken... 
  [Moroz] Well, what will you do if, for example, Kiev decides 
to introduce a state of emergency? 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) In politics it is difficult to predict 
all the alternatives when you use the conditional mood--"if..." 
That is the first thing. Secondly, there are no premises for 
introduction of a state of emergency. Everything is proceeding 
normally, everything is being done within the framework of the 
law, including within the framework of Ukrainian law. I can only 
express my sympathy to the esteemed president of Ukraine for the 
fact that his legal advisers did not very thoroughly work 
through the legal documents concerning the survey. 
  [Moroz] Did you speak to him about this after he prohibited 
the survey? 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) As you know, it is the senior who has 
the right to address the junior, and not vice versa. 
  [Moroz] Are you not afraid that Crimea will find itself in 
the situation of Karabakh, the Dniester, Abkhazia, or even 
Yugoslavia? Some people believe that such a development of 
events is entirely likely. 
  [Meshkov] I can only express astonishment at such an 
opinion. 
  [Moroz] Why? Prior to the outbreak of the war in Yugoslavia, 
practically no one believed it would happen. 
  [Meshkov] You cannot equate two entirely different 
situations. What is applicable in Yugoslavia has nothing 
whatever to do with Crimea. We have no interreligious or 
interethnic tension here... Here no nationalists at all are 
taking root or acquiring influence. People who live here are 
individualists to a greater extent than anywhere else in the 
territory of the former Soviet Union. 
  [Moroz] Perhaps you do not see the analogy with Yugoslavia, 
but the analogy with Abkhazia is more directly apparent. The 
"Georgia-Abkhazia"--"Ukraine-Crimea" similarity is fairly great. 
And Russia is involved in both... 
  [Meshkov] No, I see no analogy here either. Both before 1954 
and after, we were a part of the people of Russia. And we remain 
so today. 
  [Moroz] What political forces in Ukraine do you consider to 
be your main enemies? And which ones--your allies? 
  [Meshkov] My enemies are nationalists of every shade. My 
allies--those who stand up for normal mutual relations, for a 
normal economy. 
  [Moroz] And what are the forces in Russia with whom you 
support good relations? 
  [Meshkov] With everyone. 
  [Moroz] You do not see any differences between them? 
  [Meshkov] The differences are quite significant. But even in 
view of all the differences, all factions of the State Duma, for 
example, are interested in the processes that are underway in 
the Republic of Crimea and around it. We are trying to use this 
interest. 
  [Moroz] Some people believe you have a very good 
relationship 
with Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) I do not know what facts such 
conclusions are based on. I have stated before and will state 
again that my relationship with Vladimir Volfovich is primarily 
that of a schoolmate--we both completed studies at the law 
faculty of Moscow University. Above that, he is without a doubt 
a talented individual. As for the rest... In my opinion, 
journalists do not penetrate deeply enough into the reality that 
Vladimir Volfovich represents. It seems to me they are guilty of 
onesidedness and evaluate him exclusively according to his 
manner of communicating. In actuality, Zhirinovskiy is far more 
serious than the way he is presented in the mass media. 
  [Moroz] What is your attitude towards Zhirinovskiy's 
political views? 
  [Meshkov] I do not really fell like talking about this, but 
since you ask... He is without a doubt, I say again, a talented 
individual. Beyond this, every politician, as we know, contains 
within himself the qualities of the snake, the tiger, and the 
monkey, but people often perceive only the qualities of the 
latter of the living creatures I have enumerated, not noticing 
the qualities of the other two. The outward behavior, 
statements, and gestures of Mr. Zhirinovskiy conceal his human 
essence, I believe. In actuality, this is a powerful intellect 
who is presented on the level of a side-show barker. He is the 
only individual of all those now in the State Duma who correctly 
determined the feelings, aspirations, and hopes of a mighty 
people. Not everyone can see this. 
  [Moroz] You state that Zhirinovskiy divined the aspirations 
of the people. But just imagine that two years of your 
presidency have gone by, you have encountered heavy interference 
over this entire period in your attempts to improve the economic 
situation, the people continue to suffer as before, and now this 
"powerful intellect" springs up who "divines" the feelings of 
the people. He points to you and says: "He is guilty of 
everything! Down with him!" In actuality, of course, no such 
great intellect is needed for your local Crimean Zhirinovskiy to 
emerge and, on a wave of discontent with Meshkov who "failed to 
vindicate himself," get 25 percent of the votes... 
  [Meshkov] If I encounter heavy interference, I will attempt 
to put up heavy resistance. That is the first thing. Secondly, 
we are not talking about finding the most scathing slogans. This 
is well within the power of the provincial journalist who 
devises a garish headline. We are talking about far more serious 
things, with respect to which entire scientific research centers 
have been engaged in analysis. And then we see the result that 
was obtained by these centers upon their analysis of the 
situation in Russia on the eve of the 12 December elections as 
not coinciding with reality--in catastrophic fashion. 
  [Moroz] It seems to me you are gravely mistaken in your 
evaluation of Zhirinovskiy. Which I greatly regret. 
  [Meshkov] Is he more dangerous, or less intelligent? 
  [Moroz] In my opinion--both. 
  [Meshkov] As far as the former is concerned, perhaps I could 
agree with you. With respect to the latter--no. 
  [Moroz] But think about this. There is no "powerful 
intellect" there. There just cannot be. Zhirinovskiy does not 
even have an ordinary sound intellect. As far as my regret of 
your evaluation of this figure is concerned... I hope you are 
not indifferent to the sympathies of sound-thinking Russian 
society--the Russian intelligentsia, in particular. (My 
utterance of these last words for some reason caused my partner 
in conversation to become extremely agitated. He rose from his 
chair and began to speak heatedly and emotionally--O.M.). 
  [Meshkov] There is no use in talking about this! There is no 
sense in it! Of course I value the favor of the intelligentsia. 
But an inaccurate evaluation leads to inaccurate conclusions. 
Instead of analyzing the causes, you analyze the consequences. 
This is the dangerous part! You will recall how people once 
related to the corporal. How they laughed, how they caricatured 
him. Superficial treatment overall. This is what I am talking 
about. 
  [Moroz] Well, there are still other compliments you have 
made 
regarding this figure. 
  [Meshkov] I do not agree that this is a compliment. It is an 
orientation on reality. And it is precisely what should compel 
us to treat Zhirinovskiy quite seriously. We must not depict him 
through caricatures. That is too superficial. But my attitude 
towards Zhirinovskiy is not complimentary. God forbid! 
  [Moroz] What do you expect from the elections in Ukraine? 
Will the situation there become more favorable for you? Will 
there not be increased pressure from Kiev on the Republic of 
Crimea? 
  [Meshkov] Realistic preconditions are presently in place for 
a change in the situation in Ukraine--the former nomenklatura 
personalities, who managed to become nationalists, will depart 
the political arena. They will be replaced by practical people, 
pragmatists who will decide all matters first and foremost in 
the interests of the economy, not nationalism. 
  [Moroz] Are you satisfied with your "team"? How do you 
select 
your people? 
  [Meshkov] According to the principle of professionalism and 
ability to function in an extreme environment. 
  [Moroz] But does not your enlistment of Saburov, an 
individual "from outside," someone from another country no 
less--does this not imply that you are experiencing a severe 
personnel shortage? 
  [Meshkov] No, it does not. Saburov is not "from outside." He 
is 100 percent Crimean, born in Yalta. But I am not even 
referring to that. I am not talking about the space defined by 
the borders of Crimea, but rather the space defined by the 
borders of Russia. We do not perceive borders as a norm or as a 
natural condition. Everything not in conformance with objective 
economic laws, everything that contradicts common sense--is 
nonviable. On the contrary, we could follow Hegel: Everything 
rational is real. Everything is standardized and fit into a 
norm. As far as a shortage of personnel is concerned, the 
Ukrainian Government might well wish it could boast of 
specialists in the class, on the level and with the 
qualifications of Mr. Saburov. 
  [Moroz] Some people see a certain external resemblance 
between the two of you... 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) In any case, it was not based on any 
resemblance to me that I invited him to assume the post of 
deputy prime minister. That is a fact. 
  [Moroz] What are the main tasks you have set for him? 
  [Meshkov] To do everything that can be done at this time and 
in this place to improve the economic situation. 
  [Moroz] How do you assess this situation? 
  [Meshkov] It is a catastrophe. A catastrophe colored yellow 
and blue. 
  [Moroz] (A small illustration of the president's words with 
respect to the catastrophic situation in the economy. A cleaning 
lady in a Simferopol hotel, at which a "CIS-er" [Commonwealth of 
Independent States] is fleeced to the tune of R40,000 per day 
for an average room, receives less than R9,000 a month. A civil 
aviation pilot who retires gets R18,000 in pension. The Crimean 
president himself, I was told by one of his aides, receives a 
salary of 1,900,000 karbovantsy. Despite the large number of 
zeros, this comes to just R82,610 as of the moment of my 
departure from Crimea last Saturday. Today it is reduced still 
more, since the coupon/ruble rate keeps falling and 
falling...--O.M.) You have stated that you intend to return 
Crimea to the ruble zone. 
  [Meshkov] I intend to. For us the ruble is a more acceptable 
means of payment, since our main flow of tourists--people who 
spend money in Crimea--are citizens of Russia. To provide them 
normal services, if you will, is one of the most important tasks 
of our oblast economy. And we will accomplish this task. 
  [Moroz] But there is no border between Crimea and Ukraine. 
It 
would be practically impossible to introduce a currency here 
different from that used in Ukraine... 
  [Meshkov] What is going on right now is impossible. Our 
reality of today is impossible. We are striving to return to a 
normal condition. 
  [Moroz] The way I understand it, to do this you would have 
to 
violate the laws of Ukraine? 
  [Meshkov] The laws of Ukraine constitute one of the factors 
leading to the current economic situation. The results are 
before you, as they say. 
  [Moroz] What do you see as the primary cause of the 
catastrophic situation that has arisen in Ukraine and rushed 
towards you in a wave? 
  [Meshkov] The situation is even more desperate than you 
think. But the primary cause is encroachment, the way they 
perceive it, upon the sense of national dignity of some 
nationalists of Western Ukraine, which has led to a general 
economic collapse of the gigantic European state Ukraine 
comprises. This is the price that was paid for the realization 
of nationalist slogans. And it was effected with the full 
composure, indifference, and silent encouragement of Europe and 
the United States. The United States became alarmed only when 
the nationalists put their finger on the nuclear button. While 
it was clear from the very beginning that this would happen. But 
now they are saying a Russian nationalist has come to power in 
Crimea. Where does such delusion come from? The dignified 
magazine ECONOMIST (Paris) publishes an article entitled "The 
Second Crimean War." 
  [Moroz] A month and a half has elapsed now since you were 
elected president. What has this time brought you as leader of 
the Republic of Crimea? Have there been any unexpected 
revelations? 
  [Meshkov] Yes. First of all--the attitude of previous state 
officials. This is open sabotage. It is nothing obscure or 
secretive, but rather open and defiant. 
  [Moroz] You were hoping for something different? 
  [Meshkov] No, I was not hoping for their assistance, but 
neither did I expect defiance. I did not expect that it would be 
so aggressive, clearly anti-people, irrational... And criminal, 
in the final analysis. That is one thing I did not expect. A 
second thing was the revelation as to what extent our law 
enforcement organs are infected with the disease called 
corruption. 
  [Moroz] Incidentally, you were forced to leave your position 
as procuracy investigator for attempting to bring charges 
against members of the party and administration nomenklatura 
caught in embezzlement. Do you still have this motivating drive 
to fight for justice? 
  [Meshkov] I still have the drive, and my capacities have 
grown immeasurably. 
  [Moroz] How do you intend to fight crime? Do you have a 
specific, precisely defined program? 
  [Meshkov] Implementation of the program to fight crime runs 
headlong into a personnel problem, unfortunately. There are 
insufficient personnel capable of carrying on this fight. 
  [Moroz] During your time in office have you managed to 
establish any personal contacts with the leaders of Ukraine and 
Russia? 
  [Meshkov] With the leaders of Ukraine--no. Only on the 
official level. The situation with respect to Russia is directly 
the reverse. 
  [Moroz] What do you consider yourself--a Russian or a 
Ukrainian (your father being Russian and your mother Ukrainian)? 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) I consider myself a Don Cossack. 
  [Moroz] Do you know Ukrainian? 
  [Meshkov] Yes, I understand it. 
  [Moroz] Do you read with a dictionary? 
  [Meshkov] No, I do not need a dictionary. My reading is 
fluent. But my speaking... I am not about to assert that I speak 
correct literary language. I speak on the everyday, colloquial 
level. 
  [Moroz] What place in your plans of presidential activity is 
occupied by facilitating resolution of the Black Sea Fleet 
problem? We know that Russia and Ukraine are resolving it. They 
are trying to resolve it. However, except for the seamen 
themselves, it is Crimeans who suffer more than anyone else from 
a failure to resolve this issue. 
  [Meshkov] This problem is essentially resolved. The only 
question is to what extent conditions of the agreement will be 
conscientiously observed. A readiness to do so is manifest on 
Russia's part, as far as I am aware. This is not true with 
respect to Ukraine. The Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet. This 
is natural. It is economically feasible. All the rest will 
depend on the rational or irrational actions of the other side. 
For us the presence of the Black Sea Fleet is a benefit that 
would be a sin not to take advantage of. 
  [Moroz] How is your intention to take Ukrainian armed 
formations out of Crimea being executed? 
  [Meshkov] I requested the Ukrainian leadership to remove 
first of all those troops that were introduced in violation of 
agreement and the existing order (troops may be introduced only 
with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea). The presence 
of these forces does not contribute toward normalization of 
relations between Crimea and Ukraine. In addition, they are 
occupying a fairly large amount of territory which could be used 
for economic purposes. Finally, they represent a certain threat 
to the ecology. 
  [Moroz] What is the numerical strength of these troops? 
  [Meshkov] They are fairly large units, unfortunately. 
  [Moroz] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported about 60,000. 
  [Meshkov] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA rarely errs in these matters. They 
have reliable sources. 
  [Moroz] It is apparent that Crimean Tatars followed the 
appeals of their leaders and voted against you. Many of them do 
not recognize you as president. Do you hope to be able to 
shatter their negative attitude towards you? 
  [Meshkov] It is incorrect to assert that the Crimean Tatars 
do not recognize the president. It would be more accurate to 
state that the leadership of one wing of the national movement 
of Crimean Tatars entered into alliance with my political 
opponent and supported him. And when he lost, they declared they 
did not agree with the one who won. This is not politics. This 
is not on the political level. It is on the mundane level. It is 
simply undignified to resolve political problems on the mundane 
level. As far as support from ordinary citizens of the Republic 
of Crimea is concerned, a million or more of their votes is more 
than sufficient to be able to calmly sit down in this chair. And 
among that million are a great many citizens of Crimean Tatar 
nationality. 
  [Moroz] Do you intend to repeal the quota of 14 seats for 
Crimean Tatars in the parliament, as you promised? 
  [Meshkov] I did not say I intended to repeal the quota. I 
said that I do not accept the principle of endowment of 
political rights according to nationality. I opposed this as a 
deputy and as candidate for president. And I now oppose it as 
president. It is a flagrant violation of international law and 
universal standards. But I have no intention of repealing what 
has already come about. 
  [Moroz] Do you sense any action on the part of the special 
services? Are they watching you? 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) Well, beginning from a certain time and 
at a certain level of political and state activity, this is 
inevitable. 
  [Moroz] How do you evaluate Khrushchev's unforgettable 
decision to transfer Crimea to Ukraine? 
  [Meshkov] One in a series of delirious inventions and 
decisions. It has nothing to do with common sense or with man's 
treatment of his fellow man. But from the legal and judicial 
point of view, the issue is decided. The acts of 1954 were 
declared invalid as of the moment of their adoption. Thus, 
everything is normal in this aspect. The only thing that remains 
is to return to common sense and universal concepts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roman Shpek, minister of economy, by </F>
Volodymyr Krasnodemskyy; place and date not given: "Our Bridge 
to Europe -- How Soon Will We Be Able To Use It?"] 
  [Text] 
  [Krasnodemskyy] Well, Verkhovinskyy, Rakhivskyy, Putylskyy 
and other rayons will soon receive the status of mountainous 
rayons. How will this improve the socioeconomic situation in 
the mountains? 
  [Shpek] In my opinion, the Carpathian rayons should receive 
the status of mountainous rayons. But the situation will not 
improve without an effective state policy directed at the 
development of this particular region. 
  What do we have there currently? To my regret, nothing 
serious. We should openly admit that due to the irrational 
economic policy and wrong activities, the economy of the region 
is generally socially unattractive, ecologically harmful, and 
economically ineffective. Economic contacts are disrupted; 
unemployment is climbing upward; the gap between the living 
standards of people who are living in valleys and mountains is 
increasing; the demographic situation is approaching a critical 
point; the unique nature of the region is in danger; the 
historic and cultural monuments have been neglected. Some of 
these negative tendencies are being intensified at the time of 
transition to market relations, when new economic mechanisms 
are being set up. A state program is only a way to halt these 
tendencies, to provide progressive economic changes, social 
development of the territory, and ecological protection. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] As far as I remember, in late May of last 
year, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a decree to draft such a 
program. What has been done? 
  [Shpek] We are just at the beginning but some quite useful 
work has been done. A group of researchers headed by Professor 
M. Dolishnyy from the Institute of Economy within the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences in Lvov studied proposals of local 
administrations, ministries, departments, research institutes, 
and high establishments, and drafted a concept for socioeconomic 
development of the Carpathians. The key principles of this 
concept were discussed at the international conference "The 
Carpathians Are a Ukrainian Bridge to Europe: Problems and 
Prospects" in September of last year, and in general they were 
praised by its participants. 
  The state program for socioeconomic development of the 
Carpathians is being drafted on the basis of this concept. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] Participants in an international conference 
called the "Carpathians a Ukrainian bridge to Europe." 
Obviously, this was not accidental. 
  [Shpek] Really, this is an apt and a broad symbol. However, 
in the context of the Ukrainian foreign policy, the geopolitical 
location of the Carpathians always eased the entrance of Ukraine 
to various European economic, public, and political structures. 
By the way, we currently observe this in international 
developments, for example, in the process of setting up an 
association "Karpatskyy Euroregion" for international 
cooperation which officially began working in February 1993, 
after signing a Joint Declaration of Foreign Ministers of 
Poland, Hungary, and Ukraine, as well as constitutive documents 
of this association. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] The negative cases and tendencies which are 
ever more pressing in the Carpathians are, no doubt, the 
heritage of the previous economic policy. However, many 
mistakes were made in the post-communist period, particularly, 
in the way the economic and structural reforms were implemented. 
In the opinion of scientists and politicians, lack of a rigid 
regional policy in Ukraine led to the current state of the 
Carpathian economy. 
  [Shpek] The program of the regional socioeconomic 
development 
should unite the state and regional interests on these 
territories, and should provide for sensible compromises between 
them. Admittedly, regional interests demand that job 
opportunities and the employment for the local population be 
raised. At the same time, the state cannot do away with sulfur, 
timber, coal, and other mineral raw materials that the mountains 
are rich in. Can a compromise be found? Of course. But the 
two parties should gain profits. Therefore, a compromise 
between local and state interests should be based on fair and 
equal relations between the state and the region. The state 
regional policy should guarantee a competent regional policy in 
provinces. Only then a policy could be a success, if the rules 
of the game are not violated. 
  A strategic goal of the prospective territorial development 
is based on the optimal use of all local resources to set up an 
efficient market economy that will grant material welfare to the 
population, and ecological security to the region. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] What directions in the regional 
socioeconomic 
policy, in your opinion, are of primary importance? 
  [Shpek] First of all, it is necessary to implement a 
socially 
oriented structural reconstruction of the economy by shifting 
the impact to the mountainous territory. Almost three quarters 
of the labor force there work in the production sphere which 
certifies the socially unfavorable character of the local 
economy. 
  In the Carpathians, we have some 800 springs of medicinal 
mineral waters of virtually all balneology types, among them 
such rare waters like Truskavetska and Skidnitska "Naftusya," 
Morshyn brines, Transcarpathian carbonates, and others. We have 
considerable reserves of mud and ozokerite; around 34,000 
hectares are occupied by health resorts where people improve 
their health. Eventually, in every season, the Carpathians 
could be a paradise for tourists. Thus, the entire region should 
become a big recreation and tourist center for our state with a 
corresponding infrastructure. In addition, it should become a 
basis for training Ukrainian sportsmen in various winter sports. 
By the way, only 10 percent of the present recreational 
potential of the region is being used. 
  It is necessary to set up a highly developed market 
infrastructure and transform this region into a specific 
training ground for attracting foreign investments in the 
Ukrainian economy, for the development of mutually beneficial 
cooperation with European states. By the way, potential foreign 
investors will first of all be interested in setting up joint 
medical and tourist businesses. The cost of land plots for 
building and natural resources -- to be used during the process 
of exploitation of these sites -- could become the Ukrainian 
share, aside from its direct financing. 
  The next important issue is that market reforms will start 
working efficiently only when a region becomes more independent 
in introducing the state economic levers in its economy. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] Already two years ago, one third of all the 
unemployed registered in Ukraine lived in the Carpathians. The 
situation in the mountainous regions is very tense. How can the 
state assist us this time? 
  [Shpek] It is necessary to change the investment policy: 
Capital investments should be planned beforehand. To be more 
exact, the network of small businesses that are flexible and 
able to invest in recreation sites in the time of transition to 
the market should be set up in agricultural regions and townlets 
  Municipal services are an Achilles's heel of the region. In 
this area, we are lagging behind the industrially developed 
countries. For example, setting up a network of private shops, 
bars, hairdresser's, small hotels, and car repair shops will 
ensure jobs for thousands of the mountaineers. I mean the 
setting up of a network of traditional handicraft industries 
such as embroidery, weaving, carving, etc. It is necessary to 
develop and upgrade various forms of employment (the state, 
stock holding, cooperative, or custom production); and various 
organizational forms (part time jobs, work at home, etc.). 
  [Krasnodemskyy] The Carpathians have always attracted 
tourists by Gutsul handicraft industries and fresh air. People, 
including schoolchildren and students, came to Kosov, Vorokhta, 
Yaremcha, Kryvorivnya to breathe fresh air. They are still 
coming today. However, my colleague-journalist returned from 
Yasinya and said regretfully: Mountain skiing bases are almost 
empty. 
  [Shpek] It could be explained by climbing prices for rest 
there. In addition, the ecological situation in the Carpathian 
region leaves much to be desired. By all means, it is not as 
dangerous as in the Transdniester region or Donbass, but we have 
problems. According to the degree of the air pollution, our 
region ranks fourth in the state, but our soil is likely to be 
the most contaminated with pesticides and mineral fertilizers. 
  Felling trees is harmful to our nature in general and 
recreation zones in particular. Mountains become bald and this 
leads to an increase in landslides, and floods in the 
mountainous rivers.... All this triggers changes in the 
microclimate. As a result, the health-giving properties of our 
recreation zone decrease. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] Therefore, it is necessary to urgently 
formulate an ecological policy on a principally new basis. 
  [Shpek] You are right, but we should be realistic. Our 
activities should be based on the objective estimation of our 
real chances. For example, the cardinal resolution of 
ecological problems could be achieved only on the basis of new 
technological and structural changes in the economy. This 
demands enormous assets and much time. We have neither the 
first, nor the second. 
  Nonetheless, we should pay attention to some other factors. 
Only the resolution of specific problems could regulate the 
mechanisms and methods ensuring an efficient nature protecting 
policy. If done otherwise, the processes can go out of control, 
and we cannot allow this to happen. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] What should be done in the nearest future to 
protect the natural resources of the Carpathians? 
  [Shpek] We will shift from a policy of eliminating results 
of 
pollution to the preventive activities, and we will fight with 
reasons and not with consequences. We should check out the 
ecological safety of production sites, means of communication, 
etc. to minimize the chances of ecological accidents. We should 
eliminate conflicts between businesses and ecology and ensure 
their close cooperation. We should always remember that 
economic reforms should improve the ecological situation, not 
worsen it. 
  [Krasnodemskyy] The region which we are speaking about has 
the densest network of historic and cultural monuments in 
Ukraine. It is just enough to recollect that around 7,000 
places of interest -- that is 14 percent of all Ukrainian 
historic and cultural heritage -- are protected by the state. 
Here, in the Carpathians, the rich spiritual culture -- 
original customs and rites, local household chores, wooden 
churches and houses of Gutsuls, Boysks, Lemsks -- has been 
preserved. Is it not for these very reasons that Gnat 
Khodkevich, the founder of the Gutsul theater and the author of 
one of the most wonderful plays about the Gutsuls reminisced: 
"I opened my mouth in admiration when I came to the Gutsul 
region and continued living there with my mouth open for the 
next six years." 
  [Shpek] People who come to the Carpathians are fascinated by 
its nature, colorful landscapes, and its spirit of freedom. 
Mountainous vicinities of Krinorivni where Ukrainian cultural 
leaders used to walk, the art of Kosov craftsmen, Kosmach poems 
and embroidery, where, according to epics, legendary Dovbush 
died -- all this should be properly kept, alive in our memory 
and soul, and be actively used for the development of our state. 
  Until now, the Carpathians have been compared with our 
neighbors -- Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia -- as having an 
insufficient amount of museums. Therefore, at first, we should 
open a museum of specific trades which are characteristic to our 
region; a museum of local lore, history and economy; an 
ethnographic, art, and memorial museum. Castles, palaces, 
ancient buildings of an exquisite European style which are being 
irrationally used now, could house these museums. 
  It is necessary to set up well-equipped restoration shops in 
oblast centers and their branches in other regional towns and 
rayons to restore historic and cultural heritage -- ancient 
palaces, cultural buildings, and old quarters of our cities. 
If, for example, this is done in Kosov and Kolomyya, it will 
increase the opportunities for restoration work several times 
over.

<F P=106> [Article by Mykola Tymchuk, professor, economic commentator </F>
for UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, president of the Nauka--Rehionu 
Association: "Separatism Stirring Where Anti-Ukrainian 
Sentiments Exist. The Causes of Economic Collapse and Ways To 
Overcome It"--Conclusion. -- see FBIS-USR-94-030 28 Mar 94 pp 
20-22 for first installment] 
  [Text] First part in No. 4 
  It is imperative for a large state like Ukraine to pursue an 
economic policy with respect to her regions that takes into 
account the ethnic, demographic, natural and climatic, and 
resource characteristics of a region's development. For nearly a 
year, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the presidential 
structures have been developing and discussing a draft of the 
basic directions that Ukraine's regional economic policy should 
take, but so far, as in the case of most key normative and 
legislative decisions, this document has not been approved by 
the Supreme Council, even though the president has cited this 
draft on many occasions in his speeches. 
  As one who took part in drafting individual provisions of 
the 
above document at a certain stage of its preparation, the author 
of this article believes that the implementation of economic 
independence requires that the state regional policy guarantee 
local governing organs the following essential powers: 
  a) to make policy regarding the development of education, 
health care, culture, and other aspects of the social 
infrastructure, taking into account the historical, national, 
and demographic characteristics of the given region. 
Unfortunately, because of the economic crisis, practically 
nothing is being done at this time to solve these problems; 
  b) to implement measures directed at the socioeconomic 
revival of the country's rural regions. Towards this end, it is 
necessary to develop regional programs, based on the national 
program for social rural renewal, specifying the necessary 
sources and funds to finance these objectives; 
  c) to create finance and budget as well as credit and 
banking 
systems, which would interact with the state system. The regions 
should have the funds they need to pay for their socioeconomic 
programs, drawing on various sources of revenues into the budget 
and into extrabudgetary funds; 
  d) to create a regional taxation system, which would make it 
possible to create local budgets. As a matter of expediency, a 
single-channel mechanism for setting up local budgets and 
allocating their funds should be introduced, based on the 
premise that they be formed from the bottom up. At present, the 
Ministry of Finance of Ukraine is inclined to allow only a 
two-channel system of creating budgets -- through parallel 
deductions into the local and state budgets; 
  e) to form and regulate the prices of goods and services 
that 
are produced by enterprises in the local economy, as well as the 
prices of other producers' goods, by applying economic levers 
(taxes, benefits, subsidies, credits). As a matter of fact, 
pursuant to a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, 
beginning with this year, the prices of consumer goods and 
services are to be regulated at the expense of local funds. 
<H8>  5 </H8>
  What should be the directions and mechanism of economic 
change in the regions? Economic changes will be successful only 
if the state and the regions comprehensively coordinate their 
actions. The rules for making the transition to the market 
should be defined at the state level, while the mechanisms for 
implementing these rules should operate at the local level. 
  For example, take an important measure on the road to a 
market economy like privatization. The Supreme Council having 
passed laws on "large" and "small" privatization, it is up to 
the regional organs in charge of privatizing state and communal 
property to implement these laws with the help of an appropriate 
mechanism -- the creation of investment funds, surety companies, 
opening of privatization deposit accounts, conducting 
competitions, auctions, etc. 
  At present, however, the most important thing is to 
determine 
what is state-owned and what is communally owned. A battle is 
being waged over this, making it possible for sharp operators 
from the local nomenklaturas to conduct so-called property 
"privatization." That is why the president's edict, which 
elevates the role of regional subdivisions in charge of 
privatizing state property, is appropriate. This will make it 
possible to establish a clearer division between state and 
communal property and create regional and local communal 
property funds. It is desirable that local government organs, 
taking into account territorial features and regional 
privatization plans, be able to complete most of the "small" 
privatization of objects this year. 
  Due to bureaucratic red tape and the absence of a 
well-defined organizational and normative mechanism, the 
privatization of housing is almost frozen. So far, only some 20 
percent of the housing fund has been privatized in Ukraine's 
cities. The principal cause of this slowdown is that people have 
been given no guarantees that they will be provided with housing 
and municipal services. I believe that it is necessary to speed 
up not only the privatization of housing, but, first and 
foremost, the privatization of enterprises that provide housing 
and municipal services. 
  The regional mechanism of economic change requires the 
necessary levers to foster the development and growth of 
business enterprise, and, above all, small and medium-sized 
businesses. In most developed countries, these businesses 
account for 60 to 90 percent of the total number of enterprises, 
and their share of output volume constitutes from 40 to 60 
percent. Therefore, most questions with respect to the operation 
of small and medium-sized businesses should be decided locally 
--beginning with the registration of the relevant business 
entities and ending with the creation of regional markets for 
the sale of production. In addition, local government organs 
should create economic conditions designed to best promote 
business enterprise: tax benefits, financing, subsidies, etc. At 
the same time, they should use the same economic levers to 
restrict business activity that is undesirable in a given 
region. Although we already have a state law on business 
enterprise, we have still not worked out a mechanism for 
regulating the development of business enterprise on a given 
territory. This mechanism should include the preparation of a 
regional program (business plan) for the development of business 
enterprise, the creation of the necessary infrastructure 
(information and consulting firms, educational centers, 
investment funds, etc.), the passage by the representative 
organs of government of certain normative acts on the economic 
regulation of business development, etc. 
  An essential direction of market-oriented change at the 
regional level is the creation and development of a market 
infrastructure, which includes commercial banks, exchanges, 
advertising, auditing, insurance, and other companies. At 
present, Ukraine has close to 250 commercial banks. This number 
is much too small to serve the country's business community. For 
example, in the United States, there is a banking institution 
for every five to ten thousand people. 
  But perhaps the interests of a territory are affected most 
tangibly when we talk of creating the so-called free economic 
zones (VEZ). According to some sources, there are currently 
nearly 2,000 VEZ of more than 20 different types in existence in 
the world. It is possible to find small territories (up to 10 
square kilometers in area) in every region of Ukraine that could 
be turned into free economic zones and serve as centers for 
attracting foreign investment and technology and for 
special-purpose means of organizing production that could then 
be gradually expanded throughout the rest of the territory. But 
the most suitable territories for free enterprise zones are in 
the Ukrainian Black Sea region and the border regions in the 
western part of Ukraine. These territories are conveniently 
located in transportation and economic terms and ecologically 
less polluted. The necessary documentation has already been 
prepared or is in the process of being prepared for free 
enterprise zones in Zakarpattya, Mykolayiv, Odessa, and 
Chernivtsi oblasts. Final decisions on the creation of the VEZ 
are being held up in the center's bureaucratic offices. It would 
therefore be more expedient to hand over most questions 
regarding the creation of free enterprise zones and the terms on 
which they function to be decided by the regional authorities, 
which would take into consideration interest in creating the 
appropriate type of VEZ. 
  It is legitimate to ask: is it not possible that the free 
enterprise zones might result in the realization of separatist 
aims? As a matter of fact, this fear arose when the government 
organs of Zakarpattya put forward a proposal for a free 
enterprise zone in Zakarpattya Oblast. It is true that nowhere 
else in the world does there exist a free enterprise zone of the 
kind they have proposed. And if we take into consideration that 
this proposal calls for the administration of the Zakarpattya 
VEZ to be autonomous of the state, this is only a step away from 
political independence. What has been put forward in the 
Zakarpattya VEZ proposal generally applies to all regions of 
Ukraine. It is a demand, first and foremost, for economic 
independence. But then why separate the entire oblast in 
administrative terms from the state system of government? This 
being the case, I believe that questions associated with the 
determination of the status of a free economic zone should be 
subject to approval by the center. 
  The regional mechanism of market-oriented change can 
function 
efficiently only if it includes measures for the social 
protection of the population of the given territory. 
  The implementation of the directions and mechanisms of 
economic change in the regions requires rather serious 
organizational measures and, primarily, certain decisions by the 
central governing organs, as well as the will and desire of 
local leaders, broad popular support, and, above all, a sense of 
overall responsibility for the future of our integral 
independent Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Col. Gen. Kostyantyn Morozov, military </F>
commentator of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA: "Taking a Look at the 
`Partnership for Peace.' Appeasement By the Betrayal of 
Partnership. Questions of Security, Nuclear Disarmament, and 
Relations Between NATO, the U.S., and Ukraine"] 
  [Text] It seems that, having won the cold war against 
communism, the West and its military organization NATO, found 
themselves not knowing which way to turn. The question arose: 
what next? No matter how hard the provincial diplomacy of the 
countries that emerged out of the ruins of the USSR tried to 
persuade Western politicians of their peaceloving intentions and 
their desire for democratic change and integration, there was no 
sign of any significant response from the West. Western 
politicians listened to them, reassured them, but did not act 
accordingly. The West was perfectly aware that these countries 
posed absolutely no threat, that the democratic changes are 
being implemented by trained politicians (there is a real 
shortage of them in the provinces) [as published], and that 
there is no particular advantage to developed from integration 
with the hungry. 
  The West did not envisage (nor did it seek) new formulas for 
effective cooperation with a whole host of new states. Things 
were more or less clear as far as the countries of the former 
Warsaw Pact were concerned. As soon as they emerged from under 
the influence of communist ideology, they immediately turned 
towards cooperation with the West, including its military 
structures. 
  The countries that formed on the territory of the former 
USSR 
merited special attention from the West. The presence of nuclear 
weapons in Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, Ukraine's singular 
position with respect to her attitude towards nuclear 
disarmament, Russia's harsh policy of pressure on her former 
sister states in the Union directed at creating obstacles on 
their road to independence -- all these things prevented the 
est, and especially the United States, from formulating a clear 
plan for building relations with the new states. It is 
preferable to deal with a single partner -- we often heard this 
undisguised nostalgia for the past. This makes it easier to 
direct one's own policy and to predict that of the other side. 
Thus a new center was needed to replace the USSR. Immediately! 
It goes without saying that Russia aspired to assume this role. 
  The West wanted Russia to be its only partner in solving all 
the problems that arose with the collapse of the Union. 
Consequently, the West did not condemn Russia's policies towards 
some of the CIS members. The West needed this CIS that the rest 
of us find incomprehensible. It represented for the West that 
future center in which Russia would be the leader. And this 
leadership was already discernible in the growing ambitions on 
the one hand, and the shaping of a policy of relations with the 
"older brother" on the other. 
  All that this center lacked was the necessary level to 
control the emergence of problems of an unnecessary partnership 
with the countries of Eastern Europe. 
  In order to involve everyone in a joint effort to achieve 
this end, at the end of 1991, the West came up with the idea of 
cooperation with NATO. Almost all the countries seized on this 
idea. Russia was to be the leader of all those who joined. 
  A situation was needed that would unite the CIS members more 
closely around Russia and force the West to reject the 
inopportune demands of Eastern Europe for close cooperation. 
There was not enough pressure on the West by the new "center"... 
And so they began to organize it. 
  The first voice to be heard was that of Andrey Kozyrev. The 
Russian foreign minister delivered a speech in Stockholm that 
shocked all those present. He virtually announced to the world 
that Russia wanted to return to the cold war. "Too many 
liberties should not be taken with `Great Russia'," stated the 
diplomat. "The territory of the former Soviet Union... is a 
space on which Russia has to defend its interests will all 
available means, including military means!" 
  The Western delegates were stunned by this sensational 
speech. And even though Kozyrev explained later that same day 
that he had been joking, they have been repeating this same 
"joke" for more than a year now. The old Russian parliament, 
which passed a resolution on the status of the Ukrainian city of 
Sevastopol, and the new Duma, which has rehabilitated the State 
Committee for the State of Emergency and reverted to thoughts of 
restoring the empire, are "joking" in this very same vein. 
President Yeltsin, who even earlier had recognized the right of 
nations to self-determination but not their right to separate 
from Russia, condemned the parliament in words, but in reality 
he was "joking" as well. And now, having announced that his 
foreign policy is based on defending Russians in all the 
countries of the world, he is "joking" in the Duma. Just a month 
after the Stockholm "joke," in January 1994, Kozyrev himself 
announced that Russia would leave its troops on the territory of 
neighboring countries: "We should not give up our presence in 
these regions, which have belonged to Russia's sphere of 
interest for centuries." Kozyrev was "joking" once again, only 
more concretely this time, when he advised Western diplomats not 
to rush to open their embassies in Kiev because they would soon 
have to downgrade them to consular representations. 
  Jokes are fine, and therefore after some of the explanations 
that follow, everything seems to fall into place, but policy is 
being shaped. In shaping it, Russia increasingly treats other 
countries in a joking manner. That is what Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin did when he gave his "O.K" for the entry of Poland 
and her Visegrad colleagues (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and 
Hungary) into NATO. This time, it was the generals from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense who 
unanimously made excuses in Moscow for the president's joke in 
Warsaw. "Expanding NATO membership threatens the security of 
Russia" -- such is Russia's current policy on this issue. 
Unsurprisingly, it did not incur any resistance from the West, 
because the West was waiting for it, and Eastern Europe 
understood this. 
  The West now has to formulate a new policy. It should be 
perceived not as a new policy, but as a continuation of earlier 
policy which has already been accepted -- that is, within the 
framework of military and political cooperation. 
  The North Atlantic Council on Cooperation [NACC] lasted a 
little over two years. It was created on an American initiative 
by a decision by the NATO Council on 8 November 1991 and 
announced as the Rome Declaration on Peace and Cooperation. The 
declaration established new relations with the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe. Instead of opposition 
--consultations and cooperation aimed at strengthening the 
initiatives of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. 
  This initiative for cooperation was immediately accepted by 
all the states of the former Warsaw Pact, including the states 
of the former USSR. Two conferences of defense ministers of NATO 
countries with their partners in cooperation within the 
framework of the NACC were held in Brussels (1 April 1992 and 31 
March 1993). The first meeting of the session of the military 
commission on cooperation was held on 10 April 1992. At this 
meeting, the chiefs of the general staffs, representing the same 
parties as those taking part in the conference of defense 
ministers, planned cooperation among the partners for the coming 
year. 
  I visited Brussels at the end of February. This time, 
meeting 
with political and military representatives, including NATO 
representatives, as well as during my visit to NATO 
headquarters, I received no answer to my question regarding what 
new mechanisms of cooperation have been established by the 
"Partnership for Peace" program that had not been offered by the 
NACC initiative. Why was there a need for a new initiative, and 
what is the purpose of persuading us that the new program opens 
up wide opportunities for cooperation? 
  There are no answers. There are only strenuous appeals to 
embrace the program as a new wise step by President Clinton, his 
Administration, and NATO towards peace in Europe. 
  What is this program in reality? Countries have been given 
the opportunity to decide for themselves how close they wish 
their relations with NATO to be in the future. This is to be 
done by submitting formal requests which will serve as the basis 
on which draft agreements between NATO and the partner countries 
will be jointly prepared. The framework document grants all who 
sign it the same rights as those already established for them by 
other documents, which Ukraine and all the other future partners 
have already joined. In particular, the new document sets forth 
the general commitment "to voluntarily abide by the provisions 
of the UN Charter and the principles of the Declaration on Human 
Rights." It also contains valuable clauses that hint at security 
guarantees for our state: "especially to refrain 
[emphasis mine -- K.M.] from the use of force or the threat of 
force against the territorial integrity and political 
sovereignty of any state, to respect existing borders..." And 
more specifically: "...fulfilling the obligations that they 
assumed in the field of disarmament..." 
  This is followed by a statement of the goal of the 
partnership, which, in my opinion, had already been made in the 
earlier principles of cooperation contained within the framework 
of the NACC, and which do not commit anyone to anything. 
  As to new provisions, it unlikely that Ukraine will take 
advantage of them in the near future. Because our country has no 
money to maintain a "liason office" at the Brussels headquarters 
or to maintain there "personnel, property, and equipment," and 
no aid for this is anticipated. 
  The key principle is set forth as follows: "NATO will 
consult [emphasis mine--M.K.] with any active member 
of the partnership, if this partner perceives a direct threat to 
its territorial integrity, political independence, or security." 
That is all. Nothing more. 
  What is the strategic premise of the new program? 
  One can arrive at the answer on one's own by simply 
reflecting on one thesis that failed to attract sufficient 
attention from analysts and the press. Responding to a question 
from journalists regarding the objective of the "Partnership for 
Peace" program at a press conference in Brussels on 9 January of 
this year, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the partnership 
"...will give us the best means by which to respond should the 
future be threatened." In other words, the goal is not to 
strengthen trust between the countries of Europe by expanding 
NATO membership through greater cooperation with the partners 
within the framework of the NACC, but to respond to crises with 
existing forces and political means. As regards the partnership, 
it applies to the more powerful, as does peace among them. 
  It is not difficult to see that what we have here is the 
same 
division of "spheres of influence," in which there is no room 
for cooperation on an equal footing for the partners. There is a 
strategic objective, and strategy requires strategic partners. 
The partnership for peace is meant for the powerful, and the 
powerful know well enough whom and how they should allow or 
invite to cooperate with them as their "partners." 
  The partners have been divided in the same way as 
territories. Nonnuclear Ukraine with her hopeless economy and 
undefined policy is clearly to be left to her old "master," who, 
by restoring ties (the disruption of which, incidentally, is 
being lamented in Ukraine for three years now), will provide us 
with work and sausage and will defend us from those he deems 
necessary. 
  It is difficult to cooperate with those who have not taken a 
clear stand, because it is difficult to predict their policies, 
and for that reason (at least for now) there is no reason to 
trust them. Because trust means concrete assistance in exchange 
for something in the future. And this future (be it socialist or 
social-market oriented) cannot be discerned, at any rate in 
Ukraine. That is why self-reliance is another goal of this 
compromise program. On 10 February 1994, The Washington 
Times published an article entitled "Talbott foresees no 
change in focus," in which it quotes the deputy secretary of 
state: "If... reform in the East falters, if a new threat 
arises, NATO will be able to work through the partnership to 
protect regional stability through closer ties with the active 
participants." 
  But since it is clear even now that reforms are faltering 
(in 
Russia, of course, because this has nothing to do with Ukraine 
whatsoever), a partnership is possible only between the centers. 
The second center (other than the U.S.) was traditionally the 
USSR. Now Russia is ambitiously pushing to take its place, and, 
appeasing it, the West supports this. 
  Nothing reflects a country's political intentions better 
than 
its budget. On 7 February 1994, the Clinton Administration 
published details about appropriations for its new policy on 
foreign aid... 
  The Administration will refrain from allocating budget funds 
to specific countries. But the review materials of the U.S. 
Congress note that an exception is made in the case of Israel, 
Egypt, and... Russia. 
  The apartments of Ukraine's citizens have not grown any 
warmer as a result of our nuclear weapons having been pawned for 
energy supplies from Russia, but where is that promised 
multimillion (to start with, then to be followed by 
multibillion) aid that we were to receive from the West? 
  There are plans to allot 2.8 billion dollars from the U.S. 
budget for "building democracy." Of this sum, the former Soviet 
republics (which, insultingly, also include Ukraine) are to 
receive 900 million dollars, which is approximately half the sum 
allocated last year. This reduction is especially interesting in 
light of the recent announcements made by the American 
administration to the press that it is "doubling" assistance to 
Ukraine to 300 million dollars, which amounts to nearly 12 
percent of the current 2.8 million [as published]. If this 
percentage does not change substantially, Ukrainian democracy in 
1995 will receive "all of 100 million dollars in aid." (Footnote 
*) (Based on data provided by the Pylyp Orlyk Institute of 
Democracy [11 February 1994].) Aid to Central and Eastern Europe 
is also being reduced. 
  The American negotiators who recently succeeded in 
persuading 
the president of Ukraine of the necessity to deprive Ukraine of 
her nuclear weapons were inspired by a secret assessment by U.S. 
intelligence that Ukraine will most probably not survive the 
next two years as a fully sovereign state. The Ukrainian people 
hoped in vain that they could hold on to their nuclear weapons 
until they received substantial economic aid and adequate 
security guarantees. 
  The declaration promising the surrender of weapons without 
assistance and guarantees was signed by the president of Ukraine 
on 14 January of this year, and by 8 February, our foreign 
minister signed in Brussels and thereby espoused the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, which rids Ukrainians of other 
illusions as well. 
  Thus, Ukraine will be provided with economic assistance and 
security guarantees by Russia at Russia's own discretion. We 
have thus come full circle. It would be interesting to know what 
prognoses and conclusions Ukraine's own intelligence service is 
arriving at. 
  The partners have be betrayed, appeasement continues, but 
will there be peace? 
  The position of the West is understandable, but who will 
understand us? 
  I am astonished by the position of our president, who was 
unable to achieve the objective in the negotiations which we had 
posed from the very beginning. Now they "report" to us that our 
missiles are allegedly in a dangerous condition and that we have 
no more time. But just two weeks before the Moscow summit, 
Defense Minister Radetskyy assured the citizens of Ukraine in a 
television appearance that the opposite was true. In other 
words, there was time then. 
  Ukraine's journey to specifically trilateral talks was a 
difficult one --more than a year was spent persuading us that 
only with the participation of a third party, and specifically 
the U.S., could we be confident that the fulfillment of 
obligations assumed by the parties would be monitored. In my 
opinion, all three parties to the agreement should have assumed 
obligations. Ukraine -- reduces her nuclear weapons and, if it 
proves impossible to organize their conversion on her own 
territory (the Supreme Council adopts a decision following a 
review of government programs), she hands the weapons over to 
plants in Russia. Russia --compensates Ukraine for the value of 
the materials in the nuclear weapons, including tactical 
weapons, and guarantees Ukraine's security for her part (commits 
herself to eliminate pressure, blackmail, threats of force, and 
territorial claims from her policy towards Ukraine). The U.S. 
--promises to monitor the fulfillment by the parties of their 
obligations and, by its own policy of relations with Ukraine and 
relations with Russia, to promote political relations between 
Ukraine and Russia founded on principles of justice and security. 
  The obligations assumed by the parties should be ratified by 
their respective legislative bodies and be subject to 
verification by an international commission created by all three 
parties. Were this the approach, we in Ukraine would not feel 
that we are again being stripped naked and that an attempt is 
being made to cheat us. These would be those external political 
guarantees, which together with internal political, economic, 
and social guarantees, would guarantee our security. This was 
something that we (at least I) stated many times at various 
talks: "That is how we in Ukraine envisage the guarantees that 
we are talking about." I do not know whether the president and 
Foreign Minister Zlenko envisage these guarantees in the same 
way. It was Zlenko's job to reach the same conclusions, prepare 
the data on which the president could form his position, and 
plan the negotiations. I know many more intelligent people who 
work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but apparently the 
minister himself abides strictly by the principle "it is easier 
this way." 
  Or, perhaps, we have no one at all whom we can entrust with 
affairs of state, no one on whom the president can rely? 
  One is seized with sadness upon reaching this conclusion. Is 
our own policy being conducted outside the context of world 
politics? How many concessions have already been made, and how 
many more are being planned... These are the very things that 
are reducing Ukraine to a second-rate position in world 
politics. These include, first and foremost, hindering the 
building of our Armed Forces and the system that will assure 
their security, which, coupled with "invisible borders," makes 
it impossible to lay the foundation for our own security and our 
own military policy -- a situation that puts in question the 
independence of our state policy and, therefore, Ukraine's very 
statehood. In another sphere -- putting off the implementation 
of the principles of a social-market economy helps to maintain 
the catastrophic situation in production, and, along with 
growing crime, heightens social tensions among the people, who 
are being incited in an increasingly organized manner to demand 
brotherly ties with our neighbor. Finally, the lack of state 
programs for supporting and reviving national culture, science, 
health, and sport are destroying all hope of things improving in 
the future. But hope dies last. 
  The people of Ukraine are holding elections specifically for 
the purpose of getting a new parliament, which will work in the 
interests of the state, of getting a new government, capable of 
finally beginning economic reforms, rather than confining itself 
to market phraseology, while continuing to work in a 
command-administrative system. The people are hoping that at 
least their children and grandchildren will have a normal life. 
  We are for partnership and, unquestionably, also for peace. 
But not for a partnership, in which there will be peace only 
between the centers, peace attained through the division of 
spheres of influence. We do not want to become part of an empire 
for the sake of peace only between the West and the empire. We 
want peace in our own land as well, peace in our own home. We 
want our own partnership with others and not through 
intermediaries. And we will have it. If we become a state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Lebed, commanding general of the </F>
14th Russian Army, by D. Mosiyenko and R. Khotin, IMA Press, 
special for LITERATURNAYA GAZETA; place and date not given: "The 
Dniester Region Could Become a Second Yugoslavia, Thinks 
Aleksandr Lebed, Commanding General of the 14th Russian Army"] 
  [Text] 
  [Question] On the eve of the parliamentary elections in 
Moldova, President Mircea Snegur announced that he will insist 
on the complete withdrawal of your army from the Dniester region 
in 1994. What do you think about this? 
  [Lebed] As the saying goes, there is desire, and there are 
possibilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the 
troops of one state are on the territory of another one, I 
answer: It is bad. Must they be withdrawn? Yes, they must. When, 
is a separate question. When will the economic and political 
conditions be created under which it will be possible to 
dispatch trains here for the redeployment of subunits, and so 
that local women do not assault our units, as happened 
previously... These conditions do not exist now: One and a half 
years of peace did not produce anything, negotiations between 
the sides in the conflict are not being conducted, and, 
unfortunately, no political settlement is being looked into yet. 
As for the economic conditions--well, troops have already been 
withdrawn from Georgia and other republics, as a result of which 
a hundred thousand officers and warrant officers are dangling 
between heaven and earth without work, without apartments, and 
without prospects. This is no longer acceptable, and no one will 
support this in the future. Diplomatic problems also exist. How, 
for example, will Ukraine see it if I start to transport weapons 
and ammunition through it? After all, its railroads will be 
overloaded, and, indeed, the freight, to put it mildly, is not 
safe. There is also a technical side to the matter. Taking into 
account the existing rail lines, loading platforms, and the 
number of weapons, the redeployment will take two years. This is 
if there is an uninterrupted pullout--night and day, summer and 
winter, on workdays and holidays... How can there be any talk of 
1994? 
  To utilize ammunition here is also unrealistic. But now the 
game is one-sided--leave, and that is all. 
  [Question] Some politicians, in particular Bundestag Deputy 
Brigitte Schulte, the leader of the NATO group of observers at 
the elections in Moldova, believe that the presence of the 14th 
Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's 
participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
  [Lebed] For me, this German woman is not an authority and, 
indeed, women have nothing to do here in general. Let her come 
and try to withdraw this army from here. The former Soviet 
troops have withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave and, 
afterwards, following the division of the Union, the second 
started. The Western Group of Forces left Germany and the 
Northwestern left the Baltics. This entire mass of officers, 
warrant officers, military equipment, and preposterous 
apartmentless servicemen... The economic situation in Russia and 
Ukraine is now such that it is impossible to solve the present 
problem quickly. But since this is the case, it has to be 
resolved in a humane way. When the question of the withdrawal of 
the British Army of the Rhine from the FRG arose two years ago, 
the English calculated that it would take nine years. The 
Germans checked it out--yes, precisely so. This is the civilized 
approach. 
  [Question] Who in the future could take the place of the 
14th 
Army? Perhaps the UN "blue helmets?" 
  [Lebed] Let us agree that not long ago we were citizens of 
one country and that we will come to an understanding between 
ourselves quicker and easier than the Americans, Germans, and 
English. There are, for example, trilateral peacekeeping posts 
of Russians, Dniester region people, and Moldovans. There are no 
interethnic problems among them. And the military commanders 
know each other, inasmuch as they served in the same army at one 
time. A certain military-political balance of forces has 
developed in this region. If it is now crudely violated in a 
unilateral way... Let us imagine that our army is not here 
tomorrow--immediately the temptation arises to resolve in one 
leap and in two hours a problem that set teeth on edge a long 
time ago. Someone will fill this vacuum. Imagine there is a 
leap, but victory is not achieved, and a long conflict ensues; 
but this place is smart, and everyone owes something to everyone 
else. The map of Europe was redrawn more than once according to 
the results achieved by the victorious soldiers of one side or 
the other. In the Dniester-Moldovan conflict it can be proven 
that white is white and black at the same time, only in one case 
it is necessary to get documents from the 18th century, and in 
the other, the 19th century. Therefore, this may be a second 
Yugoslavia. A lot of sound thought has to be put in before 
disrupting this balance. I personally cannot yet conceive of how 
to withdraw the subunits entrusted to me from here. Even if 
tomorrow someone else is its commander, he also will be unable 
to do this. The people are not chasing the army from the 
Dniester region--on the contrary, they are holding on to it. 
  Because troops were pulled out of the far abroad in a 
disgraceful record-breaking timeframe, complicated tasks came up 
frequently: For example, disband a division in two months. And 
then the question arose: Where is your place of birth? If you 
are from Tiraspol, let us send you, lad, to the commanding 
general of the 14th Army, and he will find you a place. As a 
result, 51 percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant 
officers I now have were born in this region. Everything got 
mixed up in the home of the Oblonskiy: The Army is Russian, the 
last name of the commander is Lebed, his combat deputy is 
Melnichuk, armaments deputy--Dymar, rear services-- Perepadya, 
and the relatives of all of them are more often than not in 
Ukraine. But on the whole all this is gibberish that must be 
stopped as quickly as possible. Ukrainians, Russians, 
Belarusians-- all are Slavs, people of one destiny and blood, 
and one faith. We have to think about not what disunites us but 
about what unites us. But we are divided like Siamese twins that 
have two heads and one body. If they are separated, you get a 
hybrid from either one of them. Well, we are now working on 
hybrids. 
  [Question] What are relations like between the command 
authorities of the Army and the Dniester region leadership? 
  [Lebed] They were never simple. The Tiraspol leaders 
introduced idiotic money (rubles before 1992 with a stamp 
depicting Suvorov and a face value), they are poking their nose 
into other people's affairs, having sent hundreds of assault 
rifles in October to the White House. They are making decisions 
on some kind of citizenship, they are introducing outlandish 
legislation, they have privatized 30 kilometers of the Russian 
pipeline that goes through the territory of the Dniester region, 
and they have taken jurisdiction of the air space over the 
Dniester-Moldovan Republic, while possessing no airport or 
aircraft. I resigned my commission as a Dniester region deputy, 
inasmuch as I am categorically against the rude interference in 
the internal affairs of the state and in the army that I serve. 
The kind of president and the kind of parliament to have is 
Russia's affair. The Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents are 
irrelevant here.

<F P=106> [Article by Margarita Kornysheva under the rubric "Crime and </F>
the Law": "Until the Chicken Has Its Head Cut Off"] 
  [Text] Here is some information about the drug trade 
obtained from confidential sources. First, not only do 
well-established systems for the delivery and distribution of 
narcotic substances operate in Estonia, but we also have our own 
trained experts who are capable of determining the quality of 
the "merchandise" and pricing it in a highly professional 
manner. Second, there is a "fixation" on the border, where only 
"dupes," random people, get caught. Third, there is a quite well 
developed secrecy system. Fourth, cruel laws apply to the hilt 
within the drug groups--if someone quits the game, or "spills 
the beans," he therefore chooses "eternal rest" somewhere in a 
quarry in Manniku. Fifth, threats against narcotics policemen 
are increasing, and actions against them are quite real. All of 
this is happening against the background of the fact that, in 
the words of the psychiatrist Anti Liiv, "even the revolt in the 
northeastern area of the country is less of a catastrophe for 
the Estonian people than drug addiction." 
<H5>  `A Strange Small State in Which the Drug Problem Is of No </H5>
Concern to Anyone' 
  Doctor Liiv, who at one time practiced in the United States, 
maintains that this is precisely how Americans perceive Estonia. 
  As you will understand, this problem "did not exist" in our 
country until sometime in 1985, just like prostitution, 
corruption, and all manner of other "capitalist ills" "did not 
exist." Finally, they came to their senses and saw that one in 
four apprehended thieves had something to do with drugs (by now, 
one in three criminals commits the crime either intoxicated with 
drugs or in possession of these substances). In short, the 
phenomenon manifested itself sharply. Moreover, compared, for 
example, to the year 1988, which is usually the reference point, 
the phenomenon has grown to a quite respectable size. Data 
quoted by the newspaper ARIPAEV not so long ago show that 
according to the most conservative calculations, each of the 
8,000 uncovered drug addicts spends 200 kroons weekly for the 
poison. The annual volume of the local drug trade comes to at 
least 60 million kroons. How are they to be legalized? We do not 
have a law that hampers money laundering although, in an effort 
to get the endeavor off the ground, representatives of the 
competent organs have visited the West to "collect material" in 
order to offer our legislators the draft of this particular law. 
The republic still does not have a state program for combating 
drug addiction, nor is there a major specialized police unit in 
the scope of whose interests drugs would fall. Who benefits by 
so nicely sweeping under the rug a problem that clearly 
threatens the very life of our society? 
  In the opinion of Anti Liiv, and it is hard to disagree with 
him, the current government benefits. What other explanation is 
there for the fact that Estonia, a UN member, has failed to join 
a single international convention forbidding trafficking in 
narcotic substances? One cannot help wondering, all the more so 
because the last document of this kind that was accepted by the 
international community in 1988, hinders money 
laundering, requiring that commercial secrets which are of 
certain interest be revealed. In view of the absence of a 
coordinating center for drug control, our country has been 
unable to submit information about the domestic drug trade to 
the UN for three years now. 
<H5>  Narcotic Poison in Estonia Is 10 Times Cheaper Than in Europe </H5>
  This is the case on the "black" market. According to 
information obtained from the security police, a five-gram 
package of marijuana and one cubic [centimeter] of liquid opium 
cost 50 kroons, one gram of hashish--no less than 75 kroons, and 
a cubic [centimeter] of a synthetic drug (too weak for 
"professionals")--as little as 25 kroons. Cocaine belongs to a 
class of the most expensive and, apparently, least popular 
"substances" for this reason. It is not cheap in Europe, 
either--a five-gram package fetches $205. 
  At present, drugs of both vegetable origin (marijuana, 
hashish, opium milk) and medicinal origin (diazepam) are common 
in the republic. The former are more common, after all. 
Depending on the specifics of transportation, their form differs 
widely. A drug-sniffing dog "smells" drugs of vegetable origin. 
However, the contrivances of drug dealers may rob it of the 
scent. Previously, drugs were often transported in car bumpers. 
The "merchandise" was placed there, and fresh epoxy resin was 
poured over it. There is no way that a dog would "sniff out" a 
drug in this hiding place for the next three or four days. 
  Opium poppies--quite recently, this combination of words was 
associated solely with Central Asia, and to a lesser degree with 
Ukraine. However, a few years ago it was learned how to grow 
this crop in Estonia and Lithuania out of high-grade seeds 
brought in from Kazakhstan. There are hills with plantations 
between them. They can only be seen from a helicopter, and are 
not visible from the road. The owner harvests, say, one-tenth of 
a hectare, sells the crop, and buys a new house, a horse.... In 
1989 an entire syndicate delivering drugs from Lithuania to us 
was uncovered. Fourteen people ended up in the dock. 
<H5>  The Realm of Transit </H5>
  Poison comes to Estonia from Russia, Lithuania, Central 
Asia, 
and the Caucasus. Luckily we cannot afford Western products. New 
times have resulted in new opportunities for drug sales. The 
transit of drugs through the Baltic area, in particular through 
"us," previously without precedent, at any rate on this scale, 
has become established. 
  Given the actually nonexistent border and the "most 
incorruptible" customs in the world, the organization of 
deliveries is not too exacting an endeavor. Outside groups have 
appeared which have ultimately established themselves solidly 
here. The deep pockets of their members have been helpful in 
securing residence permits or citizenship for them. And how many 
nerves do the common residents of Estonia shatter battling for 
the same?! 
  According to data from the security police, everyone and his 
brother plies the drug trade: The drug business in Estonia is 
controlled by Azeri, Perm, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Riga, and 
Krasnodar groups. For example, the Azeris control the delivery 
of marijuana and hashish, and people from Krasnodar--that of 
both marijuana and opium poppy. A case in which the traffic 
police stopped a new Opel, in whose trunk 10 kilograms of 
marijuana were found, at 1915 on 4 January on the Tartu Highway 
close to the locality of Moega, is characteristic. It was 
learned later that the drug was being transported from the Viru 
section of the border and was controlled by an Azeri "company." 
Most likely they were driving to an out-of-the-way location in 
Harju Rayon. Practitioners are aware of these cases. The 
interested person locates a hamlet with a granny as old as the 
hills: "Here are 100 `greenbacks' for you, go buy yourself a 
goat. In return, put my suitcase away somewhere, and let it sit 
there until needed." The old woman does not care: "Son, toss it 
in the hayloft. I am not pressed for space." 
  All "outsiders" have connections to local "brigades," more 
often than not Russian-speaking, which deliver, for example, 
opium poppies from the areas of the Chu Valley and Issyk-Kul in 
Kyrgyzstan. The pattern is as follows: the south--Estonia--our 
countrymen pick it up, pay for it, and transport it to 
Scandinavia through their own channels. Over there, dealers get 
the "merchandise" and dispose of it "on the spot" (the lion's 
share of narcotic substances remains in the region) or ship it 
on to Europe. 
  According to information from the Department of Police of 
the 
Republic of Estonia, last year more than 100 kilograms of 
various drugs were confiscated in the territory of the republic. 
Specialists believe that this was quite a lot, but they state 
sadly right away: Certainly, more than that went abroad. 
<H5>  The Black Triangle </H5>
  This consists of the suppliers, distributors, and consumers 
of poison. As a rule, those who put drugs in circulation do not 
"get high" themselves. They are more cunning and slippery than 
the usual common criminals. 
  An alarming situation has developed in Tallinn. Police 
functionaries are aware of about 30 apartments in which the 
manufacturing of drug preparations is organized on a large 
scale. According to data of the law enforcement organs, 
gatherings of those fond of smoking or shooting up form 
virtually on every street! Drug addicts are becoming a class. 
Incidentally, there are people among them who are quite high on 
the social ladder. Terrifying reports have been received from 
some schools in the capital city--some students of senior grades 
(but not only them!) become links in the chain of the 
distributors of narcotic substances, almost inevitably getting 
their first taste of the latter. 
  People in the know maintain that so-called "pure" drug 
addicts do not exist in nature. This means that people who have 
become addicted to drugs are prepared to do anything ahead of 
time, driven by the fear of "withdrawal throes" alone. Let us 
say that such a person picks up three or four kilograms of 
"merchandise," keeps one-third, and sells two-thirds. Chasing 
clientele, he would be happy to get anyone and everyone 
"hooked." Be that as it may, this is an income, although there 
is a risk of incurring criminal liability. Of course, they 
steal, too, but the funds procured in this manner are not major. 
  Specialists predict it will not be long before high-capacity 
underground plants for manufacturing drug preparations go on 
line in Estonia. One does not have to be a specialist to duly 
appreciate the exceptionally favorable conditions that bring 
this "bright future" closer. There is nothing standing in the 
way of the time of prosperity coming to the soil of Estonia for 
a business which unfortunately has ranked second after the arms 
trade throughout the world.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mart Laar, Prime Minister of Estonia, by </F>
Grant Gukasov, under the "Estonia" rubric; place and date not 
given: "Finland Is Not a Model for Us"] 
  [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar answers questions 
from MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's staff correspondent in the Baltics. 
  [Gukasov] If Russia had not proclaimed itself the legal heir 
of the USSR, would relations with the Baltic countries be so 
strained? 
  [Laar] They undoubtedly would have taken on a completely 
different tonality, without the bass notes, in any case. The 
difficulty of today's situation consists in that Russia is 
actually not the legal heir to the USSR, whose legacy includes 
the numerous crimes of the previous regime, but is the heir 
mainly when it is advantageous to it, the great empire with all 
the claims to a mighty past. It is no accident that recently 
Russian politicians have been speaking more and more openly at 
the highest levels about restoration of the empire, masking this 
objective with the idea of protection of the Russian-speaking 
population in the countries of the former USSR. It is precisely 
on this soil that there are frequent disagreements between 
Estonian and Russian diplomats. 
  [Gukasov] Why did the collapse of other empires--the 
British, 
the French--take place in a much more civilized way? In any 
case, the colonists were decent people and were in a condition 
to determine their own fate for themselves. 
  [Laar] I would like to believe that, but my specialty is 
history, and therefore I can say that the disintegration of any 
empire has always been bloody. Our peculiarity lies in the fact 
that Bolshevism made everyone equally poor. 
  [Gukasov] Estonian politicians love to use Finland as an 
example. But after World War II, Presidents Paasikivi and 
Kekkonen did everything possible to maintain normal relations 
mainly with their great neighbor to the east. It was because of 
this that Finland achieved economic prosperity and well-being. 
  [Laar] Undoubtedly, the postwar Finnish leaders were able to 
draw the country away from the well-known Czechoslovak scenario 
and derive economic advantage for all of their people. It is 
useful for us Estonians to study the history of relations 
between Finland and its great eastern neighbor because we are 
very similar in terms of national character. But we must see 
that there are many difficulties in this country's economy and, 
incidentally, precisely because of its former orientation toward 
the USSR. Orientation toward Russia alone is very dangerous, 
especially for small countries. We cannot tie our destiny to 
such a large ship, on which anything could happen. All it has to 
do is list, and we will sink to the bottom. 
  [Gukasov] Is it possible to consider nationalism a struggle 
for privileges for a particular group of people? 
  [Laar] We in Estonia have no privileged nationality, because 
we are creating a rule-of-law state, where social relations are 
built on the basis of citizenship. And this--I want to 
emphasize--is in no way linked to nationality. I was surprised 
by the statement from Andrey Kozyrev to the effect that the 
Baltic states give citizenship according to nationality. I do 
not know about anyone else, but the Russian foreign affairs 
minister is quite well informed particularly about the Estonian 
law on citizenship. And I do not know what kind of country 
Estonia would be if all the leading posts were by directive 
filled only by Estonians. 
  [Gukasov] Your attitude toward the Representative Assembly 
(PA) of the Russian-speaking population of Estonia. 
  [Laar] Favorable. Recently the PA has been playing a useful 
role in Estonian society. A positive change has been made in the 
Russian society of Estonia. We are no longer arguing about 
whether they have to learn the Estonian language or not. We are 
speaking about how to do this better. 
  [Gukasov] On 31 August 1994, the Russian Army will leave 
Estonia. Will that put an end to all the problems? 
  [Laar] I hope that this event will take place at the 
scheduled time. We demand the withdrawal of the troops at all 
forums because this "sticking point" in the Baltic region is 
only to Russia's disadvantage. That same Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is constantly irritated: How is it that such 
little children create such big problems? Many Western diplomats 
have told me that whenever they want to break off a conversation 
with their Russian colleagues, all they have to do is mention 
Estonia or Latvia. The Russian diplomats immediately fall silent 
and leave without concealing their irritation. 
  Long ago we prepared entire files of documents that would 
put 
things in motion immediately after the troop withdrawal. A year 
ago I sent Mr. Chernomyrdin a draft agreement concerning 
transit. And there was no answer. There is no logic in this. If 
the military problem is solved, the other spheres will approach 
the norm one after another.

<F P=106> [Article by Th.: "Growing Signs of an Upswing in Estonia; </F>
Privatization According to Trust Agency Model and With Trust 
Agency Assistance; Currency Reform Forces Change"] 
  [Text] Tallin, 22 Mar--An economic miracle is emerging in 
Estonia. After the low point of the decline had been passed in 
the spring of 1993 and a 6-percent growth rate of the GNP was 
achieved in the third quarter of that year, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the highest growth rate in Europe 
for this year. Yet the statistics are still incomplete. A large 
part of the economic dynamism takes place outside the 
enterprises ascertainable by the state, in the numerous newly 
founded small businesses, especially in the service sector, 
which mostly pay no taxes. It is estimated that at present up to 
50 percent of taxes are evaded. The economic dynamism, caused by 
the introduction of the fully convertible kroon (pegged to the 
German mark at a ratio of 8:1), and the export boom together 
with the reorientation to Western markets, have contributed to 
the situation where workers dismissed from the large state 
enterprises have found jobs. In Tallinn there is practically no 
unemployment, and it is surprisingly low in the entire country. 
  The conservative, strictly market-oriented government under 
Mart Laar is pursuing privatization of the large state 
enterprises at great speed in order to make the development 
irreversible. They want to make good use of the present 
optimistic mood, and fear that some day there might be a setback 
in Estonia as in Lithuania, or stagnation as in Latvia, where 
leftist as well as national parties thunder against the "too 
rapid" privatization and warn time and again against a "sellout 
to foreign countries." The Laar government trusts that a rapid 
conclusion of privatization will strengthen the economic 
upswing, thus overcoming the present low popular rating 
reflected in opinion polls, by the time of parliamentary 
elections in the coming spring. 
  The head of the Estonian privatization office, Vaino Sarnet, 
also emphasizes that privatization must even be accelerated and 
should be largely concluded by the end of this year. In 
principle, nearly all political forces declare themselves in 
favor of privatization. But behind the criticism of 
details--unclear legal situation, sellout to foreign countries, 
enrichment by the mafia, the possibility of 
money-laundering--often lie more fundamental reservations. 
Sarnet feels the criticism, that up to now privatization has 
been delayed, to be incorrect. In addition to the offering of 
agricultural enterprises, destined solely for Estonians, the 
first international offering of state enterprises was made in 
December 1992, the second in July 1993, and the third in 
November [1993]. Now the fourth is upcoming. By the end of 1993, 
when the third offering had not yet had an effect, 54 larger 
enterprises had been sold for 353 million kroon and for 
investment promises of 237 million kroon. Furthermore, 243 
smaller businesses had been sold, mostly through auctions, for 
125 million kroon. Herbert B. Schmidt, the consultant sent to 
Estonia by the Trust Agency, adds that of the 204 enterprises 
being offered now, 50 percent have been sold--that is two-thirds 
to three-fourths of the country's industrial capacity. 
  The larger enterprises sold last year included large-scale 
bakeries in Tallinn and Tartu as well as furniture and chemical 
factories. Schmidt considers it remarkable that even the 
"Russian enterprises," which had above all worked for Soviet 
armaments, had survived. They had been able to sell Estel, the 
computer chip producer, to U.S. and Swedish interests. Although 
highly specialized firms such as Baltijets and Dvigatel had to 
cut back part of their labor force, they had survived as 
subsuppliers for Finnish and Swedish enterprises. The currency 
reform and the need to suddenly pay the workers in kroon had 
decisively influenced the switch to new markets and the opening 
up to privatization. Schmidt also expects no great difficulties 
in privatizing the Kreenholmi enterprise. Kreenholmi, with 3,500 
weaving looms and 220,000 tons of cotton fabrics is probably 
still the world's largest cotton fabric manufacturer, and the 
largest employer in Narwa. Meanwhile, the number of their 
employees has been reduced from 10,000 to 6,000. 
  Schmidt is glad that Estonia decided early on in favor of 
the 
Trust Agency's system of public offerings, for this guarantees 
investments and jobs. Actually, says Schmidt, "we are not 
selling Estonian firms to foreign countries," but rather, we are 
procuring foreign investments for Estonia.

<F P=106> [Article by Ildar Nizametdinov: "Law on Service in Defense </F>
Forces Passed"] 
  [Text] Last week the Estonian Riigikogu (parliament) passed 
the law On Service in the Defense Forces. Many issues 
of organizing state defense and the functioning of defense 
institutions are not regulated by present laws. The new law is 
intended to fill this vacuum. 
  According to the new law service in the defense forces is 
compulsory for all male citizens of the Republic of Estonia 
(foreign citizens and non-citizens are not conscripted to the 
Estonian army). 
  Active military service from eight to 12 months (the precise 
term is set by the government regarding the kind of troops and 
the tasks of a military subdivision) is required of young men 
from the ages of 19 to 27. Those who have finished active 
service are entered into reserve and in the future can be 
conscripted to military training. 
  Volunteers can start their service at the age of 17. The law 
also provides for alternative service for those, who due to 
ideological or religious reasons, do not want to take weapons in 
their hands. This kind of service is organized by military units 
and lasts from nine to 15 months. 
  Due to some family or other serious circumstances service 
can 
be interrupted for a period of up to six months. Persons who 
have finished the service can continue service on a contract. 
Women from the age of 19 to 40 can also serve in the army on a 
contract basis. 
  During discussion of the draft law the maximum age for 
conscription was reduced from 30 to 28 years after the proposal 
of the Liberal faction. Secondly, the opposition factions 
achieved reduction of the maximum term of service from 18 to 12 
months. 
  However, the Royalist faction's proposal to free people with 
advanced degrees from military service did not receive the 
necessary support. During the Soviet period they were not 
conscripted to active service although they had to cover 
military education in special military departments in the 
universities. Defense Minister Indrek Kannik also has not served 
in the army because of this stipulation. 
  Deputies of the ruling coalition had the opinion that the 
army should not consist just of "workers and farmers," 
university graduates are also supposed to serve. However, they 
have the right to choose training to become reserve officers 
instead of the usual service. 
  The law also sets the order for conscription into the 
reserves and the order of financing expenses connected with 
supplies for general military service. Persons involved in the 
military service are forbidden to participate in the activities 
of political parties, political meetings, and demonstrations.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Ivanchikov under the rubric "Dead Ends </F>
of the CIS": "If Ukraine Does Not Get Russian Gas, Nobody Else 
Will"] 
  [Text] As we plunge into the ocean of international 
intrigue, we should always be mindful of the eventual reefs and 
shoals. Russia has already hit one such reef. The impact was 
quite painful. 
  The decision to resume the delivery of Russian gas to Kiev 
would have been made even had the recent negotiations in Moscow 
between a government delegation from Ukraine and the Gazprom 
management not resulted in any specific agreements. The Russian 
side did not have any other way out of this situation. There are 
a few reasons for that. An export product pipeline to the West 
runs through Ukrainian territory. As soon as the Russian side 
reduced the delivery of fuel to Ukrainian customers, the latter 
began to use "gray" exports more vigorously. Besides, being 
aware that theft cannot go on for a long time, they pumped so 
much fuel into gas storage facilities, just in case, that it 
will suffice for the entire spring and summer period and more. 
  The largest German consumer of Russian gas, the Ruhrgas AG 
concern, warned as if in passing, at the beginning of the 
Ukrainian-Russian "gas war," that Ukraine may tap into export 
flows and begin to take export gas for its consumers. For this 
reason, Ruhrgas AG has taken measures to offset possible losses 
due to reduced gas deliveries to German consumers. This 
statement came in as the first alarm call for Gazprom. 
  In general, Kiev displayed enviable composure when faced 
with 
the "cut off the gas to Ukraine" situation. The president of 
Ukraine, who was paying an official visit to the United States, 
declared that suspension of deliveries of Russian gas would not 
only bring about the complete stoppage of Ukrainian industry but 
would also seriously complicate the execution of agreements on 
the removal of strategic missiles to Russia. 
  It was no accident at all that the moment at which Moscow 
chose to reduce deliveries of gas to Ukraine coincided in time 
with Mr. Kravchuk's visit to Washington. The Russian side, which 
cannot get the upper hand in the conflict with the obstinate 
Ukrainians, would want to internationalize the conflict in the 
hope that the world community would influence Ukraine and force 
it to make concessions. However, no official response to this 
action of Russia followed in the United States. It was rather 
the other way around. It was quite symptomatic that Washington 
allocated Mr. Kravchuk $350 million in credit, despite the fact 
that Kiev has long had the poor reputation of a deadbeat 
defaulter. In diplomatic parlance, this is called moral support. 
  There is no state program for development of the fuel and 
energy complex in Ukraine. Why? Because it does not fit the 
arrangement whereby the International Monetary Fund extends $1.5 
billion in credit to Ukraine. On the eve of Kravchuk's overseas 
visit, American newspapers quoted a high-ranking Western 
diplomat: "They (meaning the leadership of Ukraine) have been 
told specifically that assistance should not be given to state 
enterprises that are going under." Another quote: "The 
Government of Ukraine has acknowledged that it has sharply 
increased financial assistance to state enterprises; this may 
become an obstacle in the path of the extension of Western loans 
which Ukraine badly needs." According to some projections by 
American special services, "the recession in Ukraine amplified 
by regional confrontation may bring about civil war and 
disintegration of the republic." A vicious circle emerges. If 
the economy of Ukraine falls into the abyss--and in the absence 
of foreign credit and investment it definitely will--the 
situation will be in line with the scenario of the American 
special services. If the Ukrainian leadership does not finance 
state enterprises, stagnation in industry is unavoidable, which 
will be followed by a social explosion and possibly civil war. 
Does Russia need a civil war on the territory of an immediate 
neighbor, which on top of this has nuclear weapons? 
  It is known that decisions to suspend delivery of energy 
resources are always political. Therefore, Gazprom could not 
have made it independently, without supreme sanction. The 
reconnaissance in force indicated that the suspension of gas 
deliveries to Ukraine promises Russia nothing but a headache. 
  The Moscow agreements, which were hastily concluded 
(literally a few days after making the decision to reduce 
deliveries), may, if they are honored by the Ukrainian side, 
encourage certain hopes for stability in the form of joint 
ownership of underground storage facilities and main gas 
pipelines on the territory of Ukraine. (This occurred in 
Estonia, where Gazprom owns 30 percent of Estgaz.) Besides, the 
so-called Turkmen scenario has also been activated (an analog to 
the expected agreement between Kiev and Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]) 
whereby Ukrainian debts will be paid by counterdeliveries of 
merchandise and equipment, including for main gas pipelines. 
However, Gazprom, which should become the owner of at least 
one-half of the property of enterprises converted to joint-stock 
operations, may be bitterly disappointed because foreign 
property in Ukraine is not protected by legislation. This is why 
the chief of the Russian Gazprom, Rem Vyakhirev, admitted after 
the negotiations that these agreements are not all that 
advantageous for Ukraine. Despite the fact that Ukrainian Deputy 
Prime Minister Valentin Landik stated peremptorily that come 
April all consumers of Russian gas will switch to prepayments, 
the temptation to go on stealing is too great. 
  After all, it has reached the point where managers at many 
enterprises have denied access to their compounds to Ukrgazprom 
representatives who were supposed to disconnect hundreds of 
nonpayers from the gas distribution network. 
  This whole Russian-Ukrainian "gas war" also has an "Asian 
front," or more precisely, a Turkestan front, which for some 
reason is not mentioned. After all, Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], 
which failed to receive $844 million for gas delivered to 
Ukraine, does not wish to resume deliveries for now. The 
economic aspect of this decision is clear, but a political 
aspect also exists. 
  It appears that the confidence of the Turkmenbashi [Leader 
of 
the Turkmen] in transforming his republic into the first 
economic tiger of Central Asia has begun to diminish, although 
the official propaganda of Ashkhabad continues to instill in 
citizens the notion of the prompt prosperity of the land. 
However, miracles do not happen. A look at the yardstick of the 
currency market of Turkmenia would suffice to ascertain this. 
The real ratio of the manat to the Russian ruble is as follows: 
At the bazaar, 1 manat may be purchased for 45-50 rubles, which 
is several dozen times less than the officially established 
rate. For this reason they will be forced sooner or later to 
agree to painful measures aimed at cutting back budgetary 
expenditures there. The Turkmenbashi, as the father of the 
nation for at least the next decade, will have to explain to his 
subjects why his government is forced to resort to unpopular 
measures while carefully avoiding the combination of words 
"shock treatment." The insolvency of Ukraine may be one of the 
central arguments in such an explanation. Since the "Turkestan 
front" is located in the southern backyard of Russia, the latter 
has resolved to close it down. According to some data, the 
AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive Plant] (?!), which is experiencing 
great financial difficulties itself, is buying the Ukrainian 
fuel debt from Turkmenia. While they are going through the 
motions, the Russian Gazprom undertook to make up 80 percent of 
the loss to Ukraine from the shortfall in the delivery of 
Turkmen gas out of its own resources. 
  We will not have to wait long for a new turn of events: The 
deadlines for the payment by Ukraine of the financial segment of 
the debt, which was coordinated in the classified part of the 
protocol of the Moscow meeting, must be determined in April. 
  In any event, at present Russia is doomed to deliver 
gas to its nearest Slavic neighbor and suffer financial losses 
in the process if it does not want to pay for a civil war in 
Ukraine tomorrow. Such are the disturbing lessons of the 
post-Soviet political economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Smolnikov: "Russians in Turkmenia: They </F>
Are the First in the Near Abroad To Obtain Russia's Legal 
Protection"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat--Major General V. Shunevich, first deputy 
commander of border forces of Turkmenistan, was on the line. 
  "Remember how during our meeting last year I showed you a 
file of officers' applications requesting either transfer to a 
new assignment in Russia or discharge? Well, in the last two or 
three weeks it has `slimmed down' noticeably. Many officers have 
pulled their applications...." 
  I can well understand the emotion and feelings of Vladislav 
Aleksandrovich. "Last year's" discussion was held about two 
months ago, and there has been a diametrical change in the mood 
of the chief of staff, who can finally dispense with the daily 
persuasion of each officer who had submitted an application that 
he stay on. 
  The situation has been changed abruptly for the better by 
the 
agreements on dual citizenship and the status of servicemen of 
Russia's border troops on the territory of Turkmenistan which 
have been concluded between the two countries. Turkmenia's 
Russians have acquired dependable guarantees of protection of 
their rights, social primarily. 
  It should be specified immediately that the situation of 
Russians, and of the so-called Russian-speaking population in 
the republic also, had been and remains the most favorable, 
perhaps, among the several tens of millions of their kinsmen who 
by the will of fate found themselves overnight citizens abroad. 
It would be fitting here to pay tribute to the political 
intuition and purely human sensitivity of President Saparmurad 
Niyazov. Whereas in other regions of the former state 
politicians have succumbed to the nationalist narcotic, from 
which their "withdrawal" continues, the Turkmen leader adopted 
as one of the first enactments of his presidential activity an 
edict according to which infringement of people's rights on the 
basis of affiliation to another nation or religion was deemed to 
be a heinous crime. Somewhat later this was emphasized in the 
constitution and reflected in criminal legislation. 
  The problem of citizenship, which is painful for some former 
Soviet republics, has been resolved here in such a way that a 
substantial portion of the population did not even know there 
was one. All those resident in the country at the time of 
adoption of the Citizenship Act were deemed to be citizens of 
Turkmenistan, if the individual so desired, of course. The 
introduction of the Roman alphabet as the official Turkmen 
language has not been forced. True, the requirement of the 
compulsory knowledge by leaders of the top tier of the language 
of the indigenous people has brought about quite a significant 
reduction in the number of Russians, Ukrainians, and 
Belorussians in various echelons of power. But this feature has 
not caused serious complications: Many of those formerly sent by 
Moscow "to reinforce the personnel" have happily returned to 
their native hearths. Local former authorities have, on the 
other hand, no less successfully adapted to the changed 
conditions, having moved into entrepreneurial structures. The 
benevolent relations between representatives of all 
nationalities, which had taken shape over decades, have been 
preserved at the social level. And even today in even the most 
savage store skirmish for scarce commodities you will not hear 
offensive comments of the "Go to Russia and buy it there..." 
type. 
  "Ours is an international work force," K. Khomutov, 
technician of the Ashgabat Akhal Airline, shares his thoughts. 
"Initially, after the republic had gained independence, there 
were those who wished to argue about who owed whom more and 
attempts to drive a wedge between us and the Turkmen. But Ilyas 
Berdyyev, chief of the Turkmenavia Administration, reacted 
promptly. He declared strictly that professional and 
businesslike qualities would, as before, come first for him, and 
he must be given credit for having kept his word in practice. We 
are working calmly and have no intention of leaving." 
  "The situation in the country is, in fact, calm, society is 
not split, and tranquillity and benevolence reign," V. Cherepov, 
ambassador of Russia in Turkmenistan, agrees. "Nonetheless... 
there is an exodus of the Russian-speaking population. I 
consider it an entirely natural process. It began a while back, 
at the start of the 1970's, and the increase in migration 
following the disintegration of the Union is perfectly 
explicable: People have a certain feeling of estrangement from 
their historical homeland, relatives, and friends. And there 
are, in addition, transport and currency barriers and 
difficulties over children's tuition in Russian higher 
educational institutions. The children are taking in their old 
folk. Having completed their service, servicemen are leaving. 
And despite the very warm, friendly relations between our two 
countries, it was important to put the resettlement process on a 
legal, controlled basis. We have managed to do this as a result 
of the signing of the agreements on dual citizenship and the 
status of Russian servicemen." 
  "Vadim Georgiyevich, we shall be revealing no big secret if 
we speak of the difficult path toward the signing of the 
document on dual citizenship and migration...." 
  "No, certain `hidden reefs' emerged. Fortunately, President 
Niyazov is a politician who knows how to move toward a 
compromise, and arrogance is alien to him. At the most decisive 
hour, when it seemed that the Turkmen side would not agree with 
a most important point of the agreement, Saparmurad Atayevich 
went for the jugular, so to speak, of the two edicts he had 
issued previously. They concerned questions of the sale of 
privatized housing and the transfer of financial resources. 
  "So the almost 400,000 Russians of Turkmenistan have 
acquired 
the opportunity to hold dual citizenship and resolve the problem 
of a move to Russia in civilized fashion. The parties have 
undertaken to put migration under state control--to facilitate 
the emigrant's privatization of his residence, the 
transportation of his personal effects, and the conversion of 
money earned by honest labor--and to help him fend for himself 
in his new location. Important also is the legal aspect in the 
day-to-day life of the Russians of Turkmenia who are acquiring 
citizenship of Russia. Although they are required to comply 
fully with the laws of the country of residence, they are 
entitled, in the event of a disagreement with a decision by the 
local law enforcement authorities, say, to appeal to a court of 
the second state. 
  "Yes, the Turkmen leadership once again demonstrated the 
balanced nature of its approaches in domestic and foreign policy 
and an aspiration to act in the channel of international law. As 
we know, this step has evoked ambivalent evaluations among its 
CIS neighbors. Whereas Askar Akayev, president of Kyrgyzstan, 
decided to propose that parliament make an amendment to the 
constitution allowing of the possibility of the adoption of dual 
citizenship, his Uzbek colleague, Islam Karimov, has once again 
publicly repeated his proposition to the effect that a person 
with dual citizenship is a person without a homeland, in whom 
the feeling of patriotism has atrophied. I would very much like 
in response to quote artless lines from a letter of the 
economist Galina Mamedova from the oblast center of Tashauz 
addressed to the newspaper TURKMENSKAYA ISKRA: `15 years ago I 
married a Turkmen boy and came to live in Turkmenistan. This was 
not the near abroad at that time, and both I and my parents 
living in Yaroslavl Oblast and numerous relations scattered 
throughout Russia remained within one country. We could meet 
several times a year. But then this happened--the big country 
fell apart. And people such as I automatically found themselves 
estranged from the motherland and their near ones and dear ones. 
On the other hand, I have become attached to Turkmenistan and I 
consider myself a citizen of this state, my family is here, and 
my children were born here, yet I shall continue to be a 
daughter of Russia. A restless heart was being torn in two.... 
  "`It is impossible to convey in words my feelings following 
the signing by Niyazov and Yeltsin of the agreement on dual 
citizenship! Now, a citizen of Turkmenistan with all the rights 
of this country and Russia on my side also here, it has not 
rejected me, I can live with redoubled energy and rejoice in 
each new day....' 
  "And the new day in Russian-Turkmen relations is being 
prepared today even. Work on draft agreements on the avoidance 
of dual taxation, interbank relations, and mutual legal 
assistance is under way. 
  "The times demand the restoration of all the severed ties in 
new soil--equal cooperation. We cannot live without one 
another--these words from a once-popular song are highly 
pertinent," V. Cherepov says.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Moshes, Institute of Europe of the </F>
Russian Academy of Sciences: "Does Russia Need the 
Disintegration of Ukraine? It Is Unnecessary, Useless, and 
Dangerous"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Carte Blanche </H5>
  The parliamentary elections in Ukraine stimulated an 
international discussion on the fate of this state and on the 
future of Russian-Ukrainian relations. The general initial 
premises for analysis are sufficiently clear. In Ukraine, on the 
one hand, the economy is falling apart to the accompaniment of 
inflation that sometimes reaches 100 percent a month; social 
tension is increasing, which is only slightly eased by such 
phenomena as shuttle trade with Russia and the emergence of a 
stratum of Ukrainian migrant workers in Russia; and Crimea is 
threatening to become a Ukrainian Ulster. 
  On the other hand, there is a noticeable desire of the Kiev 
politicians to maintain the status quo: to reject economic 
reforms, to suppress the trend toward state federalism as much 
as possible, and to preserve the old majority electoral system, 
under which the western oblasts were without many of their own 
potential representatives in the new parliament. 
  But in Russia, despite the fact that public opinion got over 
the shock that resulted from the separation of Ukraine in 1991, 
the positions of many political forces changed only slightly. 
Those who in 1992 resentfully said to Ukrainians, "You will be 
sorry," are maliciously grinning, and they are saying, "The eyes 
saw what they were buying...." Others who have still not 
resigned themselves to the breakup of the USSR await with hope 
the appeals of the new "Pereyaslavites" concerning the support 
of Moscow, thinking that all Russia has to do is to open its 
arms and in no time Ukraine can be integrated into Russia anew. 
Neither one side nor the other goes further in its analysis, 
which would show that nothing is that simple. 
  Theoretically, four variants in the political development of 
Ukraine are possible at the present time. 
  The first variant--the most optimistic, and therefore the 
least likely--is that market reforms, nevertheless, will 
gradually take place in Ukraine, that Ukraine will rid itself of 
the aspiration to maintain a large army in Europe, and that it 
will very cautiously conduct a policy directed at the 
decentralization of the country. However, even if all of this 
becomes a reality, the process of "recovery" will be too long, 
considering the unenviable starting positions and the absence of 
a national consensus regarding the need for market reforms; and 
without the necessary care, including on the part of the invited 
doctors, the possibility of a lethal outcome is present. 
  The second variant--this is a continuation of "limping on 
both legs." No kind of fall can continue endlessly, but 
development in this direction is entirely probable in the 
medium-term outlook. 
  The third variant assumes a controlled dissolution of 
Ukraine 
in the east (plus the south) and the west, with still 
unpredictable borders. It should be noted immediately that 
Western Ukraine can fully provide a viable statehood (high 
national ideological motivation with respect to the need for the 
existence of an independent Ukrainian state, the presence of 
energy sources, and massive assistance on the part of the 
diaspora), but externally and internally a statehood that, 
nonetheless, is unstable (the presence of a considerable 
Hungarian minority, Transcarpathian Ruthenians, and Russians; 
religious tensions of the Serb-Croat type between 
Catholic-Uniate Galicia and the Orthodox Volyn; territorial 
claims on the part of certain forces of Romania to Bukovina, and 
problems with Poland.) The viability of this state is the higher 
the more exactly its borders coincide with the borders of the 
potential nucleus--Lvov, Ternopol, and Khmelnitskiy Oblasts. 
  The east Ukrainian state will strive for integration not 
with 
Russia, but into Russia, inasmuch as the power capacity of 
eastern Ukraine production does not allow it to hope for an 
independent restoration of the economy, and help cannot be 
expected from anywhere. Friction with Lvov serves as an 
additional factor. 
  The fourth variant is the uncontrollable dissolution of 
Ukraine with a possible civil war of all against all on a 
territory crammed with AES's [nuclear power stations], GES's 
[hydroelectric power stations], and nuclear and conventional 
weapons, which will mean millions of refugees and epidemics 
spreading from one place to another, and the possibility of an 
ecological disaster on a continental scale. 
  Which of the variants is most advantageous for Russia? The 
first is not viewed as a real choice--under conditions of the 
dissolution of Ukraine, which is starting before our eyes, the 
probability of its implementation is infinitesimally small. The 
importance of not permitting the fourth variant is too obvious. 
Apparently, the best solution will be the second, because, while 
it is not a gain, it is not a loss. The Kiev government is 
controlling the situation in the country by simultaneously 
assuming the social pressure and not permitting the development 
of an open conflict. And, indeed, it is much easier for Moscow 
to do business with politicians of the Leonid Kravchuk type than 
with leaders of the Ukrainian Republican Party and the 
Donetsk-Dnepropetrovsk lobbyists. 
  A unified Ukraine, which has moved into a cycle of 
preserving 
territorial unity, will not become a source of challenge to 
Russian security. This rather weak state will be interested in 
the invisible political presence of such a guarantor of 
stability, like Russia, that will promote the establishment of 
good neighbor relations. This factor, in its turn, will make it 
possible objectively to examine the territory of Ukraine as a 
kind of "strategic forward defensive position" in the 
development of plans for the defense of Russia. 
  In the event of the division of Ukraine into two states, 
Russia will have to save the economy of eastern Ukraine with 
trillions of infusions, which will destroy all of the results of 
reform in Russia itself, but in Ukraine, in the best case, it 
will preserve the situation, but it will not lead to real 
integration, inasmuch as the economic systems of the two 
countries are already fundamentally incompatible on a macro 
scale. 
  Recognizing that such a luxury is beyond Russia's 
capabilities, it will be impossible, nonetheless, to avoid the 
problem. A massive migration will begin--and not of old women 
from Kievskiy Railroad Station, but of strikebreakers who will 
aggravate the unemployment problem; the influx of narcotics will 
intensify. Economically, the justified refusal of Russia to 
accept eastern Ukraine into its system, given a continuation of 
present trends in the condition of Russian society, will 
increase the influence of nationalist forces in Russia itself. 
  Thus, the disintegration of Ukraine does not bring any 
benefits at all to Russia. Therefore, it is necessary to strive 
as much as possible to promote the stabilization of the 
situation in the present Ukrainian state. Russia, naturally, 
also does not have any surplus money now; however, it is 
possible to follow an already established precedent on the 
transfer of part of Ukrainian property to Russia in exchange for 
energy sources, or a possible redemption by Russia as such. To 
facilitate the conduct of negotiations, it is necessary for 
Moscow to display good political will, in order that it be 
understood in Kiev that Russia is not conducting "subversive 
activity," and that it does not want to wreck a unified Ukraine. 
  It is important to start a dialogue in this context with the 
opposition forces of Ukraine, if at least in order not to repeat 
the error of the USSR with respect to the countries of Eastern 
Europe, when a change of government began to denote a complete 
break. It is necessary to organize cooperation with regional 
leaders of Ukraine, whose influence in 1993 was strengthened 
significantly, together with a desire to develop cooperation. 
  It also must not be forgotten, however, that there is the 
possibility of a worse outcome. For a feasible neutralization of 
the challenge (disintegration), what seems especially important 
is the completion of the task of transforming Ukraine into a 
nuclear-free state, rendering assistance to Ukraine in the 
destruction of stockpiles of conventional weapons jointly with 
the world community, and preventing the Ukrainian Army from 
getting out of Kiev's control and its switching over to the 
influence of potential "uncles." 
  The specific measures can be argued. But in the development 
of a general line of Russian policy with respect to Ukraine, the 
keystone should be an understanding that the existence of a 
stable Russia is hardly possible without a unified and stable 
Ukraine, albeit not a fraternal one.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from the DEN Analytical Center's report on </F>
potential presidential contenders in Russia: "Who Comes After 
Yeltsin?"] 
  [Text] It is symptomatic that the leading world 
research centers follow increasingly attentively the dramatic 
struggle unfolding in the Russian Federation in anticipation of 
President Yeltsin's imminent departure from the political scene. 
More and more materials on this topic appear on the pages of the 
50 most influential periodicals of the world's leading counties. 
Questions regarding the current Russian president's state of 
health can be heard increasingly often at press conferences of 
Western statesmen returning from Moscow.... 
  Meanwhile, the corrupt Russian "democratic" 
publications and television continue cheerfully to maintain that 
"everything is okay" with Yeltsin. The DEN Analytical Center's 
experts, using some methodology of the contents, morphological, 
and factor analysis, have studied and sifted through hundreds of 
materials published in the mass media, as well as research and 
forecasting reports prepared by various science institutions and 
special services on the problem "Yeltsin and Who Comes After 
Him?" 
  Below are some excepts from this report. 
<H5>  Why Yeltsin Will Soon Leave </H5>
  In keeping with the current Constitution, new presidential 
elections are scheduled for 1996. Most serious analysts both in 
Russia and abroad, however, including CIA "Kremlinologists," 
believe that new presidential elections most likely will take 
place much earlier. 
  The reason is increasingly intensifying problems related to 
B. Yeltsin's health. In the assessment of American and German 
physicians, the current master of the Kremlin suffers from 
pathological changes in the brain caused by complications 
following an acute middle ear infection, liver cirrhosis, renal 
insufficiency, and lately also rapidly progressing stenocardia. 
He periodically undergoes hemodialysis (blood transfusions) and 
can no longer maintain a regular work schedule. B. Yeltsin's 
periods of normal state of mind increasingly often give way to 
deep depression, which can cause certain changes in the logic of 
thinking and brings persistent thoughts of suicide. Since 
February 1993, the president has had to rest and undergo 
treatment for 15 days on average every month. 
  B. Yeltsin also has fully expended himself as a politician; 
in principle, he is no longer able to offer anything to lead the 
country out of the wide-scale, systemic crisis (proof of that is 
the president's February state of the union address). Having 
finally realized the meaninglessness of the October bloody 
massacre and the inexorable impending economic collapse, B. 
Yeltsin has found himself in political zugzwang. Trying to 
maneuver, he only creates the appearance of activity, although 
in reality he can no longer change anything even if wanted to. 
He simply does not have the proper tools for this: The state 
apparat has been practically destroyed by him and his inner 
circle in the course of "democratic" purges and "reforming," 
while the remnants of this apparat are extremely corrupt and the 
economy is inexorably sliding into a coma, since the real 
administrative levers have been lost in the course of Gaydar's 
"reforms." 
  The president's inner circle is perfectly well aware that B. 
Yeltsin is broken morally and psychologically, and contemplate 
increasingly often his early resignation (according to Sergey 
Filatov). What keeps him from this is probably the fear of 
culpability--not so much in a moral as in a criminal sense, the 
charges of which the new authorities may bring against him 
regardless of their political coloration. 
  In addition, he may be forced to resign under the pressure 
of 
a mass protest movement, caused by potential avalanche-like 
enterprise stoppages, the blood clots of insolvency, growing 
unemployment, and a sharp decline in the standard of living. 
Strikes and serious mass unrest may reach a critical point as 
early as by April-May. It is significant that in this situation 
it is precisely those who until recently had been B. Yeltsin's 
closest confederates--Ye. Gaydar, V. Shumeyko, G. Burbulis, G. 
Popov, Yu. Luzhkov, and even V. Chernomyrdin--are ready to 
"surrender" their president in order to shift onto him all the 
responsibility for the national catastrophe. 
  Some Western special services' analysts do not rule out the 
possibility of physical removal of B. Yeltsin in the event that 
the situation get worse, for the purpose of "tying up loose 
ends." As an argument in favor of the probability of such a 
variant they cite completely irrational actions of the 
president's associates involving various destructive 
reorganizations of special services, which has caused a sharply 
negative reaction among many staff members of the Main 
Protection Directorate, the Vympel special unit, and the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. Besides, these structures also can 
be used by the mafia in order to bring their own man to power 
with the help of a terrorist act. 
<H5>  The `Leader's' Heirs </H5>
  Last year B. Yeltsin promised the Russian people "to find 
and 
nurture" his successor, who could guarantee the continuation of 
his 
reforms. 
  One of the first to proclaim himself the successor of the 
increasingly infirm leader of democrats was Ye. 
Gaydar. He got the presidential seat in his sights, at the 
same time disregarding objective circumstances that were not 
shaping in his favor. Despite the loud crash of Gaydar's 
reforms, which were being implemented without any 
thought-through plan and assessment of potential consequences, 
the commissar's grandson did not learn any lessons from it. 
Repeating the hackneyed free-market incantations during his 
election campaign, and having spent about 15 billion rubles [R] 
contributed by such financial giants as Menatep, Most-Bank, 
Stolichnyy, Tokobank, and Inkombank, he led Russia's Choice to a 
crushing defeat. And this is keeping in mind that he had at his 
disposal all the capabilities of the state apparat, which was 
utilized and directed by S. Filatov. 
  Nevertheless, Ye. Gaydar, who is very susceptible to the 
crudest flattery, undertook to set up his own party, which he 
intends to use as a tool in his struggle for the president's 
job. More farsighted radical democrats, however--such as G. 
Burbulis, B. Fedorov, and others, including old Democratic 
Russia hands L. Ponomarev and G. Yakunin--looked skeptically at 
this idea. Gaydar does not have much of a chance to create an 
effective national party, especially considering that G. 
Burbulis, S. Filatov, and others already had announced more than 
once the creation of a "Yeltsinite" presidential party but had 
failed. 
  Despite the support of a considerable part of financial 
capital, small speculative business, criminal-mafiosi clans, as 
well as most of the mass media, as the economic crisis deepens, 
Ye. Gaydar's hopes for making it to the presidency become 
increasingly ephemeral. It is actually to the advantage of Ye. 
Gaydar's competitors that he of all people intends to declare 
himself the leader of the radical democratic forces at the 
elections. Ye. Gaydar's current fellow travelers and allies--K. 
Borovoy, with his Economic Freedom Party, and P. Bunich's 
coalition--do not have any serious influence on the population 
today. 
  Most importantly, Ye. Gaydar does not have either slogans 
that are attractive for the entire spectrum of public opinion 
nor original ideas and plans capable of solving Russia's 
problems. It is not accidental that such experienced politicians 
in the United Sates as Secretary of State W. Christopher and 
Clinton's personal friend S. Talbott have already practically 
written off Ye. Gaydar. 
  Federation Council Chairman V. Shumeyko considers 
himself a potential successor to the current Kremlin ruler. So 
far he has not officially declared his claim to the presidency, 
but inside his inner circle, during drunken parties and in 
public baths, he boasts of his tallness and thick hair as the 
most necessary prerequisites, in his opinion, for the future 
president of Russia. 
  During the years of B. Yeltsin's rule, V. Shumeyko has 
climbed a career ladder from director of a medium-caliber plant 
in Krasnodar to deputy speaker of the Russian parliament, and 
then a first deputy prime minister, who delivered to the 
leader-president the adoption of his new Constitution, which in 
turn earned him the place of the first chairman of the 
parliament's upper chamber. Truly a glittering career for a 
mediocre man, who possesses neither global thinking nor the 
serious experience of a major politician and administrator, not 
to speak of elementary decency. In his ascent to the pinnacle of 
power, he was helped by such personal traits as 
unscrupulousness, perfidy, and cynical hedging. That the 
notorious international-scale fortune-seeker D. Yakubovskiy is 
V. Shumeyko's closest confederate-- and according to wicked 
tongues, also his treasurer--speaks for itself. 
  Now, using his position to establish contacts with the 
regions, V. Shumeyko is preparing for himself a base for a 
presidential race. At the same time, he has no chances of 
winning the fight for the president's job. Influential regional 
leaders treat him with barely concealed contempt, while the 
general public has not forgotten the general procuracy's 
investigation of V. Shumeyko's case on charges of corruption. 
  The next potential successor to B. Yeltsin and his political 
disciple is S. Shakhray, who began speaking of his 
presidential ambitions as early as in the spring 1993. 
  S. Shakhray acts more cautiously today; he learns from 
other, 
more experienced politicians, and persistently conducts active 
organizational work, setting up structures for the election 
race. Despite a de facto defeat in the parliamentary elections, 
the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], which he had 
created, did pass its first durability test. PARES possesses 
weak but nevertheless realistically operating organizations in a 
whole number of regions. During the election campaign S. 
Shakhray received substantial financial support mainly from 
commercial structures controlled by V. Chernomyrdin's group. In 
the words of V. Shokhin, spoken in confidence in a small circle, 
"....when Serezha (Shakhray) saw that he was not getting 
anywhere with the party (PRES), he dropped on his knees before 
the prime minister, begging, `I will do everything you say, just 
help me.' It was then that V. Chernomyrdin gave him both the 
money and the Gazprom infrastructure...." 
  S. Shakhray for all practical purposes has created the PRES 
Central Committee apparat using as a base the Ministry of Ethnic 
Affairs and Regional Policy, and uses his official capacity as a 
minister to strengthen party positions at the local level. He 
strives to expand the infrastructure of his support in the 
center and the regions, using K. Zatulin's entrepreneurs union, 
and is attempting to set up an information corporation made up 
of a number of newspapers, magazines, and radio and television 
programs, united by regional and national subject matter. 
  S. Shakhray displays cynicism, unscrupulousness, and an 
orientation on political expediency at any cost. Today he 
behaves "flexibly": He proclaims his cooperation with the 
communists in the State Duma; he supported the exoneration of 
the October events' participants. The work he had organized with 
respect to signing a treaty with Tatarstan was completed 
successfully and the treaty signed. Also, S. Shakhray skillfully 
made use of the idea first put forward by Yu. Skokov--forming 
the Russian state in the current environment on a 
treaty-federative basis, which allows for the solution of a 
multitude of complex ethnic and regional problems. This is 
despite the fact that only recently S. Shakhray, together with 
S. Filatov, had been a vehement opponent both of the idea and of 
Yu. Skokov himself. 
  S. Shakhray possesses a specific momentary thinking, and the 
complex of a provincial Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist 
Youth League] functionary who has suddenly found himself in a 
high-level job in the capital. He is well known for unrestrained 
self- advertising; the desire always to say something in the 
mass media-- with or without good reason; handing out numerous 
promises, which remain just empty words; and the inability 
independently to solve major and complex problems. All of this 
makes him rather a lightweight in the eyes of the political 
establishment. "For Russians, the short, round Shakhray, with 
his magnificent mustache, is more an object of insulting jokes 
than a real political figure." 
  Because of this, it will be difficult for him to change his 
negative image in the foreseeable future; keeping also in mind 
that he lacks constructive global ideas on how to lead the 
country out of the economic dead end, his chances in the fight 
for the presidency are extremely low. Besides, over the past few 
weeks S. Shakhray's financial support has dropped dramatically. 
  History has the last laugh: People who make it to the top 
are 
most often not the most honest and intelligent but the most 
crafty and brazen ones. An example: the so-called mayor of 
Moscow Yu. Luzhkov (illegally appointed to this job some time in 
the past by B. Yeltsin). Actually, today, when he has already 
begun his own election campaign, Luzhkov no longer publicly 
swears allegiance to the president. 
  Under Mr. Luzhkov, the capital city turned into a huge 
refuse 
pit, one of the largest criminal centers in the country. Moscow 
is today one of the ten most dangerous capitals in the world. 
Just recently, demonstrating his loyalty to B. Yeltsin and 
"democratic ideals," Luzhkov several times used the capital city 
militia for brutal beatings of old men and children. He is one 
of the main figures responsible for the mass murder of Russian 
citizens in October 1993. 
  Now, however, the hour has struck for another merrymaking 
feast of political monkeys! Today Yu. Luzhkov presents himself 
as the defender of "ordinary people," fights A. Chubays, no 
longer threatens "Red-and-browns" with prison and execution. At 
a recent February meeting with Afghan war veterans, Yuriy 
Mikhaylovich beat himself on his broad chest and sincerely swore 
that he "had never been a democrat." And when he was asked how 
he felt about G. Yakunin, the capital city mayor said without 
blinking an eye: "People like Yakunin should be drowned in an 
ice-hole!" 
  Luzhkov is supported by large banks and companies; the key 
role among thenm belongs to Most-bank (Gusinskiy-Luzhkov's 
financial group). Gusinskiy himself had been nurtured by that 
same Mr. Mayor through famous Moscow food credits! Generally 
speaking, in terms of financial clout only Chernomyrdin can 
compete with Luzhkov. According to some information, in setting 
up his organizational structure Yu. Luzhkov allocated R9 billion 
for boosting the land- assembly movement alone. The wags have it 
that the authors of panegyrics glorifying Luzhkov, which were 
published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, ROSSIYA, and other 
periodicals, each received $10,000 from the generous mayor. 
Luzhkov, however, is aware of his very vulnerable spots that may 
deprive him of a realistic shot at the presidency. 
  V. Chernomyrdin is a probable, albeit temporary, 
successor to B. Yeltsin in the event of the latter's early 
retirement. Having achieved no positive results in improving the 
economy and continuing along the general line of Gaydar's course 
toward the destruction of Russian industry, V. Chernomyrdin 
nevertheless has invested maximum effort in the strengthening of 
his support base--the financial-industrial group, which includes 
Gazprom, the Imperial Bank, and Lukoil Company. The prime 
minister has a serious financial base for a presidential 
election campaign and his own loyal people in many bodies of 
executive branch. At the same time, he has a rather weak 
standing in the mass media, which are mainly controlled by old 
(Ye. Yakovlev) and new (O. Poptsov, M. Poltoranin) democrats or 
by information concerns (NTV, INTERFAX, the SEGODNYA newspaper, 
and others), which are owned by the Most Group and take a 
generally anti-Chernomyrdin stance. 
  Some experts believe that since Ye. Gaydar's resignation, B. 
Yeltsin does not have anybody except the current prime minister 
on whom to shift the blame for the disintegration of the 
economy. If the president does decide to take this step, this 
will postpone for B. Yeltsin--although not for long--the 
inexorable fate of facing his own culpability. 
  V. Chernomyrdin does not have any strategy; therefore, he 
clumsily maneuvers in search of support: He attempts to get 
interaction with the parliament going; is willing to form an 
alliance with Yu. Luzhkov; flirts with Yu. Skokov's Producers 
Union and the trade unions. All of this is unlikely to help him, 
though: He does not have realistic concepts for getting out of 
the crisis, and even less so the ability to implement them. 
  In addition, no one in the current political circles in 
Russia has forgotten that it was V. Chernomyrdin's actions that 
have led to the bloody tragedy on the night from 3 to 4 October 
1993. While G. Burbulis in the Kremlin together with M. 
Poltoranin tried to calm down B. Yeltsin, who was already 
preparing to flee Moscow, the prime minister organized at the 
Staraya Ploshchad a headquarters for the takeover of the House 
of Soviets. It was V. Chernomyrdin who saved B. Yeltsin's 
regime, and now, "having used him as needed, they may dispose of 
him." 
  In this connection, it is unlikely that V. Chernomyrdin will 
make a promising political figure, especially keeping in mind 
that it is obvious for both the "left" and the "right" that he 
is not capable of effective action. 
  Thus, in the opinion of leading Western analysts, none of 
the 
political figures whom B. Yeltsin in principle could proclaim 
his heir can be seen today as a favorite at the next 
presidential elections. Moreover, all of them already are making 
an effort to distance themselves to some degree or other from B. 
Yeltsin in order to avoid sharing with him the political 
responsibility for the economic collapse and degradation of the 
state. 
<H5>  The Main Contenders </H5>
  If presidential elections were to be held in the next two or 
three months, V. Zhirinovskiy would have a very good chance. A 
talented populist, he at this point successfully expresses in 
his communications the emotional state of the Russian people, 
the inner psychological tension of ordinary people accumulated 
over the years of the Yeltsin regime's rule. 
  The success at the parliamentary elections in December 1993 
made the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader the 
most famous Russian politician in the world after B. Yeltsin. V. 
Zhirinovskiy and his party enjoy the support not only of 
marginal strata, but also of a number of commercial structures, 
including the Neftekhim trading house, a consortium of 
Russian-Dutch financial investment companies, and so on. Sharp 
criticism of the current regime and demonstration of patriotic 
convictions will allow V. Zhirinovskiy to gather a considerable 
vote at the upcoming presidential elections (I will repeat: If 
they take place within the next two or three months). 
  Nevertheless, V. Zhirinovskiy cannot realistically count on 
winning. His behavior in the parliament and during foreign 
trips, his propensity for catchy slogans without any concrete 
deeds, and his rowdiness gradually build up an opinion of him 
among a considerable part of the population as a cheap politico 
demagogue incapable of real deeds. Naturally, this is not 
happening without purposeful activity on the part of the 
"democratic press"; however, the LDPR leader himself all too 
often provides the pretext. 
  Besides, many of those who voted for V. Zhirinovskiy in the 
transient turmoil of the December elections gradually begin to 
reorient themselves toward leaders from the CP RF [Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation], ROS [Russian All-People's 
Union), and so on. A factor that will also work against V. 
Zhirinovskiy is that he practically supported B. Yeltsin in the 
October events. Besides, the LDPR leader does not have a real 
team, any innovative ideas on how to overcome the economic 
catastrophe, and so on. 
  Fearing V. Zhirinovskiy, special agents of the current 
regime 
rushed, or were implanted, into his inner circle--people who 
have links with criminal structures and big "dirty" banking 
business. The purpose: If attempts to buy off or completely 
discredit the LDPR leader fail, at least influence his entourage. 
  A serious contender for the president's job today is A. 
Rutskoy. In the environment of growing economic 
difficulties, for which ordinary people justifiably blame the 
president and the government, support for Rutskoy as a 
charismatic leader, a fighter and defender of the underdog, who 
suffered personally from the antipopular regime, will be 
objectively increasing. 
  If his health permits, A. Rutskoy may lead a united 
opposition by becoming its symbol. It cannot be precluded that 
in the event of mass unrest and strikes after the forced 
resignation of B. Yeltsin, the Federal Assembly as the only 
legitimate body in this situation may directly entrust carrying 
out the president's duties to A. Rutskoy, since his removal and 
arrest were clearly unconstitutional. 
  The events of the past three years show, however, that A. 
Rutskoy, an unquestionably honest and sincere man, has turned 
out to be impulsive, uncalculating, and an insufficiently 
experienced politician, without a strong team. In the opinion of 
some Rand Corporation experts, A. Rutskoy and his closest 
confederates were unable in September-October of 1993 
objectively to assess and influence the situation and to take 
the necessary and effective measures against B. Yeltsin's 
anticonstitutional actions, although they had an opportunity to 
do so. 
  One of the analysts in the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense writes: "It is hard to talk about people who behaved 
with dignity and suffered for their mistakes. There is no 
guarantee, however, that A. Rutskoy will not again fall for 
deception and will not take unfounded actions that will play 
into the hands of strategic enemies of Russia." Another weakness 
of the vice president is that while proclaiming correct, 
patriotic slogans, he does not have enough political and 
economic experience as well as organizational skills to develop 
and painstakingly implement a clear anticrisis program, without 
which the country's revival is impossible. He also does not have 
a real political infrastructure. 
  Unfortunately, detention has not improved the health of the 
twice-wounded Afghan war veteran, Hero of the Soviet Union A. 
Rutskoy. High blood pressure and other health problems will not 
help him, either, to make a successful bid for the presidency, 
in the event that he decides to go ahead with it. 
  Another notable political leader who so far has not 
announced 
his presidential intentions but certainly has good grounds for 
it is the Communists' leader, G. Zyuganov. He heads a 
truly broad-based, national party with sufficiently strict 
internal discipline. 
  Despite his practically complete isolation from the mass 
media in the course of the December election campaign, the CP RF 
achieved good results. The image of G. Zyuganov as a reasonable, 
principled man protecting the national interests of Russia has 
contributed to the Communist Party's shedding of the bogeyman 
image that B. Yeltsin and Democratic Russia had successfully 
used to scare the people as late as on the eve of last year's 
April referendum. Even in the West, G. Zyuganov is perceived 
today as an acceptable leader of a civilized party, rather than 
an extremist thirsting for class revenge. 
  Theoretically, G. Zyuganov's political knowledge and 
practical experience of organizational work make him a contender 
for the high state post. However, the CP RF's weak financial 
base, lack of serious positions in the mass media, and the 
persisting negative attitude toward Communists on the part of a 
considerable part of society--first and foremost 
entrepreneurs--do not allow the party to count on a singlehanded 
victory in the presidential elections. 
  Most likely, it would be expedient for the Communists during 
the presidential elections to form a bloc with patriotic and 
some centrist forces in order to nominate one candidate, who 
then could count on realistic success. In this case G. Zyuganov 
and his party colleagues could gain important state jobs in 
order to exert effective influence on the political course of 
the new president. 
  One German journalist called Yuriy Skokov "a 
serious man, who speaks only when he has something to say." The 
former Security Council secretary, and currently the chairman of 
the Producers Union, recently announced that he may run in the 
presidential elections in 1996. 
  A vehement opponent of savage experiments on the nation, a 
clever and calculating technocrat, capable of putting forward 
deep and well-thought-through ideas, Yu. Skokov may become one 
of the most promising candidates. It is not accidental that in 
December 1993 Ye. Gaydar said that he sees Yu. Skokov as one of 
his most dangerous opponents. 
  Yu. Skokov's personal modesty, decency, laconic speech, and 
the high expectations he places on himself and others are to a 
certain extent reminiscent of Yu. Andropov and A. Kosygin. Men 
like this traditionally are respected by the Russian people. 
  An economic practitioner and a realist politician, Yu. 
Skokov 
does indeed have a score of strategic concepts, whose 
implementation will make it possible to avert further political 
and social polarization in society, to start implementing a 
concrete operational plan for stabilizing the economic 
situation. He is well known and appreciated by directors of 
factories grinding to a halt, and by heads of republics, krays, 
and oblasts that are barely making ends meet. 
  Yu. Skokov's main shortcoming is that he is practically 
unknown to popular public opinion in the country, even though in 
influential elite circles--military, political, trade union, and 
others--he commands respect and authority. In the final 
analysis, Yu. Skokov's political fate depends on whether he will 
be able to change the trend of being kept in the shadows of 
silence. Another shortcoming of Yu. Skokov's candidacy is that 
despite his adherence to the idea of a civilized, nationally 
oriented market, he does not have well developed links with 
entrepreneurial circles. 
<H5>  Potential Figures </H5>
  S. Baburin, who a few days ago was nominated as a 
presidential candidate by the Russian All-People's Union, hardly 
has a chance not only of victory but even of making it to the 
second round of voting. However, ROS, which was eliminated from 
the December election campaign, may take quite a few votes away 
from V. Zhirinovskiy at the upcoming presidential elections (by 
the estimates of a number of Western experts, S. Baburin may 
gather 7-8 percent of the vote). At the same time, ROS' 
coalition with the communists, agrarians, and some part of the 
centrists oriented toward a strong state, and their joint 
nomination of a candidate with an unblemished reputation may 
bring the "left" and patriotic forces victory in the 
presidential elections. 
  The Russian "democratic" and the Western media on the 
threshold of the December 1993 elections frequently mentioned 
G. Yavlinskiy as a favorite. In fact, along with 
Russia's Choice, "Yabloko" [the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc] 
was generously financed by Most-bank, Stolichnyy Bank, and 
others, probably on the assumption that it was safer to bet on 
several horses. Yavlinskiy was lauded in all sorts of ways "as a 
sober and intelligent free-market reformer" by such leaders of 
businessmen's associations as M. Masarskiy and M. Yuryev; M. 
Gorbachev supported him in every way possible, including 
financially. At the same time, the criticism of the most odious 
consequences of Gaydar's reform should have brought him, in G. 
Yavlinskiy's design, the support of ordinary people. 
  However, "G. Yavlinskiy's party" did not achieve the 
expected 
results. This happened because, as a well-known American 
journalist in Moscow put it, "G. Yavlinskiy, not only for you 
Russians, but also for us Americans, is the same as Gaydar, 
except somewhat slimmer and somewhat smarter. But in essence he 
is the same kind of armchair theoretician, with a propensity for 
macroeconomic experiments `at any cost'...." 
  Like S. Shakhray and other "perestroyka chickens," G. 
Yavlinskiy is unscrupulous and a big mouth: One day he denounces 
B. Yeltsin's September state coup; then on the night from 3 to 4 
October on television he urges a merciless crackdown on the 
defenders of the Constitution. G. Yavlinskiy's loss at the 
December elections was predetermined in many respects by the 
fact that a firm idea has formed in the public opinion of him as 
a man who lusts for power at any cost. Therefore, despite the 
support of Americans who are already turning away from Ye. 
Gaydar, and the help of the "democratic press" curators A. 
Yakovlev and Ye. Yakovlev, Yavlinskiy was doomed (by the way, 
after the December elections the Yakovlev duo also cooled off to 
Gorbachev's pet). 
  The provinces, the Russian backwoods, have a very negative 
attitude toward G. Yavlinskiy. That is why he was not able and 
probably will not be able to build a national movement, party, 
or other structure drawing on a mass support. 
  One of the most significant factors in the upcoming 
presidential campaign may be the nomination of V. Zorkin, the 
former chairman of the Constitutional Court. Among the strongest 
suits of the current Constitutional Court member V. Zorkin is 
his uncompromising moral position, adherence to the letter and 
the spirit of the law, and a certain emotional attractiveness of 
his personality in the public opinion. He has coalition 
potential, which gives him the ability to bring under his 
banners a certain part of the centrist and left-of- center 
political spectrum. 
  At the same time, Western experts analyzing the chances of 
various contenders for the Russian Federation presidency, also 
note certain shortcomings in his position. In particular, he 
lacks a serious political infrastructure and does not have an 
effective economic strategy for overcoming the current economic 
crisis; his financial resources for the dynamic conduct of the 
presidential race are unknown; he does not have a team or 
experience of leading tightly-knit political groups. 
<H5>  Some Conclusions </H5>
  ....3. Three problems will be decisive for the upcoming 
presidential election campaign in Russia: attitude to the 
October tragedy; the extent of corruption at the top; and the 
economic crisis theme. 
  4. A key, but outwardly still latent problem during the 
presidential campaign will be the issue not of access to the 
highest state position but the ability to utilize this 
authority. Therefore, the candidate who will have the best 
chances will be the one to provide an adequate answer to two 
principal questions: What to do and how to do it.... 
  7. Since the country lacks unarguably personality-based 
charismatic leaders (even Zhirinovskiy represents only a weak 
type of situation-engendered charisma), much will be decided by 
the character and pace of forming electoral coalitions. Of 
particular importance in this will be not the size of political 
coalitions per se, but the organic nature of their structure. 
Many of current unofficial candidates for the Russian presidency 
very soon will begin bitter bargaining in order to set the price 
at which they will join some or other coalition.... 
  8. Judging by all signs, the emergence of "dark horses," 
that 
is, some completely unknown figures, during the presidential 
race is extremely unlikely. If this does happen, it would be for 
only one reason: the desire of some political players to split 
an opponent's coalition (or prevent the creation of an 
unacceptable coalition).... 
<H8>  * * * * </H8>
  The political time of the first president of Russia is 
inexorably approaching its end. Quite possibly, Boris Yeltsin 
today is one of the unhappiest men in the country. Maniacal 
suspiciousness, dark forebodings, fatigue, and pain constantly 
press upon this man. 
  Was he ever sincere? Even if he had been.... "The road to 
hell is paved with good intentions." He will also remain in 
history as Boris the Bloody. 
  In October 1988 Yeltsin spoke with inspiration beautiful 
words about democracy, freedom, and human rights. In October 
1993, children were being killed at his order. 
  Some time a long time ago, a father told his son some wise 
words: "Do not try to get where you do not belong." Boris did 
not listen. 
  B. Yeltsin's presidency turned into a tragedy for the 
country, Dramatic events expect the second president.... And 
still.... 
  "The future is perfect, for it is unknown."

<F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist </F>
Party of the Russian Federation, conducted by Yevgeniya 
Pishchikova: "The `Red' and `White' of the Party Bottling"] 
  [Text] "By reuniting the `red' ideal of social 
justice, which is a sort of earthly hypostasis of the `heavenly' 
truth which states that `all are equal before God,' with the 
`white' ideal of a nationally expressed statehood perceived as a 
form of existence of centuries-old people's sanctities, Russia 
will finally attain what it has longed for... inter-class accord 
and the might of a great power." ...Gennadiy Zyuganov 
  The meeting in the staff headquarters of the Communist Party 
of the Russian Federation (CPRF) has just ended. The first 
immodest impression of the party departure is the impression of 
extreme respectability. The two rooms of the hotel suite (the 
CPRF, like other influential parliamentary parties, lives its 
political life in "Mir") are filled with people in well-cut 
suits, with expensive "diplomats" [briefcases] in their hands. 
There are no stretched-out sweaters, no overalls, no first 
meetings of the "demrosses" [Demrossiya members], no young 
fellows with rolled-up sleeves, the true followers of the 
insurgent Anpilov. The CPRF, the party of Zyuganov, has 
successfully come to relative power bypassing the catacomb 
period of the communist congresses in the village of Voronovo 
and sidestepping the military actions of the October days. The 
communists of Zyuganov look so much like the leading detachment 
of the "new Russians" that it is possible to avoid base 
parallels by only one method--by remembering that the 
respectable part of the "new Russians" looks very much like the 
communists of bygone times who reached well-known heights. 
  In the staff headquarters itself there is a mixture of that 
which before was incompatible. The old and the new. Although the 
furnishings are rented, they may fully serve as the real symbol 
of the CPRF ideology. Crystal chandeliers of the "lieutenant, do 
not touch the candelabra" style and worn carpets--the 
traditional interior of socialist party apartments--are livened 
up by designer office furniture of a "wet asphalt" hue. This is 
the popular color for the expensive Mercedes and Zhiguli 99 
model. On the splendid table is a stack of papers. In bold 
letters, the address is indicated on the top one: To the Central 
Committee. The signature--a group of communists. The document 
has an air of the calm associated with verticality of power 
about it. After all, if the note is directed to the Central 
Committee, that means it will necessarily be reviewed and 
discussed... 
  Most political experts evaluate the communist party of 
Zyuganov as the most civilized of all the communist parties of 
Russia (at the present time there are five of them). It can be 
compromised with (the Zyuganov followers are sooner socialists 
than communists)--that is the approximate consensus opinion of 
journalists. The CPRF tried on for size the general line Deng 
Xiaoping--after all, they too agree to tolerate different forms 
of ownership. They have been compared with the party of 
Brazauskas in Lithuania--ultimately, the ideals of social 
justice are good in themselves, but when politicians of this 
type come to power, they suddenly remember that there are never 
enough sweet cakes to go around for all. 
  Gennadiy Andreyevich Zyuganov himself does not create the 
impression of an exhausted man, even though his political life 
is extremely active and eventful. And also not devoid of 
problems. He was, naturally, a fervent supporter of liberation 
of the October political prisoners, but now he cannot help but 
understand that, after the amazing (from the words "to amaze") 
victory in the Duma, his party is once again entering a phase of 
quiet factional struggle. Which does not facilitate unity of the 
ranks. Nevertheless, Zyuganov is full of ideas and energy--a 
serious contrast to the political leaders of the democratic 
wave, who are unable to conceal their fatigue and a certain 
devastation. Evidently, the end of the century, which is 
developing a certain set of ideas without offering any new ones 
in their stead, has little effect on the communists. They 
continue to believe that they have something new to offer the 
people. 
  In response to the question of what his attitude is toward 
power, Gennadiy Andreyevich Zyuganov said that he takes it 
seriously. His set of ideas--a synthesis of Khomyakov, 
Berdyayev, Gennadiy Zyuganov, the Sermon on the Mount and Karl 
Marx--seems absolutely viable to him. And here is the most 
interesting thing: This set of ideas really is current. And 
interesting--just as any medley is more interesting than a 
single ingredient taken alone. 
  [Zyuganov] "Power is a totally nonsynonymous concept," says 
Zyuganov. "There is civil power, which is spread to the entire 
Western part of the world--that is the power of law. There is 
the power of traditions, the power of ideas, the power of the 
ideal, perhaps even the power of prejudice--this power is 
understandable and dear to our country. And he who does not 
sense this will not achieve much in it. There is also a new 
power. It is not the fourth power, as it is interpreted, but 
rather informational power. This is a power which has become 
quite enraged in Russia. Without completely understanding what 
it is doing, it is predetermining the outcome of an entire 
series of vital events taking place in the country. There is 
also the power of money. Both informational and monetary power, 
mixed in known proportions, possess a destructive force greater 
than that of a thermonuclear weapon. Specifically this is a 
weapon--an informational-financial weapon, and it has become 
primary in the destruction of the great geopolitical formation 
which was the Soviet Union." 
  [Correspondent] For Zyuganov, as for most opposition 
leaders, 
the disintegration of the Union is the point of countdown for 
catastrophe. And for the civil war, which, in the opinion of 
Gennadiy Andreyevich, began long ago. Now his task (and 
certainly not the concern of the currently functioning 
government) is to extinguish the fire of civil war, and to turn 
those who set it toward compromise. Understandably, the 
government must also agree to compromise. And it, partially, has 
already set off in this direction. However, the CPRF cannot have 
a complete merging and civic accord with the "democrats." This 
is not difficult to figure out if, together with Gennadiy 
Andreyevich, we turn to the history of our country's shocking 
events. Particularly since a number of articles have been 
devoted to these questions in the recently published book, 
"Derzhava" ["Great Power"]. 
  [G. Zyuganov] ...In fact, for the entire duration of the 
Soviet period of history, there were not one, but two parties in 
the USSR, and there was a stubborn struggle going on between 
them, which did not subside for even a moment... The first party 
may conditionally be called the party of "our country." 
Sholokhov and Korolev, Zhukov, Gagarin, Kurchatov and Stakhanov 
belonged to it. It included a large part of the leaders and 
party apparatchiks, who toiled unyieldingly during the country's 
most difficult days... However, there was also another 
party--the party of "that country." Numerically it did not 
compare in the least with the former, but its political weight 
and influence in the higher echelons of power were 
disproportionately great, and often decisive. It included those 
for whom "that" country and "those" people were merely an arena 
for realization of their own ambitions and vain aspirations. 
This was the party of Trotsky and Kaganovich, Beria and Mekhlis, 
Gorbachev and Yeltsin, Yakovlev and Shevardnadze. Its rightful 
heritage today is "Demrossiya," and we do not want to have 
anything to do with this party. (Yet just try to tell the 
"Demrossiya" followers that they are the successors of the 
CPSU--they would faint dead away..Ye. P.). 
  By the mid-80's, such a situation was objectively formed 
within the party when the "change of generations"... inevitably 
would have brought to power politicians of the new formation, 
who gravitated toward national-state great power ideals. It is 
not difficult to imagine how such a possibility frightened our 
foreign and domestic ill-wishers! (And here they are--the 
ill-wishers--Ye. P.)... 
  After World War II, the scientific-technical revolution 
brought mankind to the technological boundary which made it 
possible to ensure global control over its development... 
  There is nothing remarkable about the fact that this evoked 
a 
sharp activization of the transnational, cosmopolitical forces 
which were striving to realize such possibilities in a concrete 
geopolitical form of a world super-state. This superstructure 
must, according to the idea of its developers, gradually swallow 
up the national sovereign states. 
  Practical work on creating such a center began long ago! 
  The developed capitalist countries readily support the idea 
of creating a "new world order" (NWO), within the framework of 
which they hope to retain and strengthen their leading position. 
  The model of a unified world economy within the framework of 
the NWO presupposes different levels of consumption for its 
component parts. Certain regions would continue to prosper, 
while the development of others would be artificially frozen. 
Need we say what category Russia will find itself in under such 
a "division of labor?" 
  [Correspondent] What awaits us in the nearest future? 
  [Zyuganov] In principle, there are two possible variants of 
behavior under the conditions which have been created. The 
first--to accept the rules of the game which have been imposed 
upon us and to fight for increasing the vital "quotas" within 
the framework of the mondialist scheme of world development. 
  The second variant presupposes that Russia will accept that 
historical challenge with which our people are faced today, will 
not reconcile itself to the coming enslavement and will try to 
recapture its former role as a great power. 
  For this, it is first of all necessary to restore the 
historical continuity of Russian statehood and our country's 
spirituality. At the same time, we must keep in mind that the 
current Russian Federation is not yet fully Russia, but an 
amputated appendage with torn and bleeding ties. Without a 
rebirth of the Union on a new basis of free and voluntary choice 
of the peoples (yet it seems to us they have already made their 
choice--Ye. P.), without the reunification of the currently 
divided Russian people, our state will not get up off of its 
knees. 
  [Correspondent] In the opinion of Gennadiy Andreyevich, the 
two revolutions of the 90's were also rehearsed. These were 
gigantic actions aimed at washing out of the government 
structures all persons who placed the triumph of Russian 
statehood above the needs and demands of the International 
Monetary Fund. The scenario for both operations was the same: 
All the politicians and honest citizens who are dissatisfied 
with the course of reform are accumulated around the center, 
which with the aid of manipulation of public opinion is declared 
strictly harmful (in the first case--the party, in the 
second--the parliament). They are specially insulted, provoked 
into ill-planned response moves, and then "duped." The victory 
of democracy is celebrated. At the same time, the conductors 
(Gorbachev, Yeltsin), do not fully realize that they too are 
being manipulated. In principle, they are interesting only as a 
symbol, and at the first opportunity--they are replaceable. 
  Terrible things are happening around these symbols. 
  [Zyuganov] ...I will not even mention the fact that the 
reformers have outsmarted themselves. They knowingly attracted 
the criminal element to break the Soviet economy. By selecting 
the formula, "dismantling through pilferage." But now the genie 
does not want to go back into the bottle. ...It has become so 
strong in Russia that not only has it gone out of control, but 
it has also become an important subject of politics--a third 
power which does not fit into any schemes of the IMF. Today its 
effect on all processes is huge, and the continuation of reforms 
according to the former scheme will inevitably lead to the 
emergence of an entirely new formation on earth--a criminal 
de-ideologized power with totally unlimited repressions within 
the country and nuclear blackmail of the entire world... The 
criminal revolution is taking place. The regime either does not 
want to or is incapable to counteracting it. And the blindness 
of the intelligentsia is amazing, their eyes covered over with 
the liberal utopia. 
  [Correspondent] Gennadiy Andreyevich, you of course heard 
Yeltsin's speech (which included also the struggle with criminal 
structures). However... 
  [Zyuganov] It is not even a question of the fact that, when 
I 
heard the speech, it reminded me of our materials of three years 
ago. You got the feeling that he had spent a long time in a 
lethargic sleep or had been on another planet and suddenly 
returned: "Good heavens, it turns out that crime is rampant." At 
the same time, one night 130,000 associates of state security 
are being dismissed (that is what it said on the dictaphone 
tape--Ye. P.), and the structure practically ceases to exist. 
This is madness! There are two major sections there--on fighting 
corruption, organized crime and banditism--and this work has 
been paralyzed throughout the entire country. It is quite 
understandable why this was done--there are too many documents 
there on those who rule. It is necessary to transfer them, the 
documents, to other hands and destroy them. However, there is a 
peculiarity in state security--materials do not disappear 
without a trace. 
  [Correspondent] How would Zyuganov solve this problem if he 
had power? 
  [Zyuganov] There has been ample experience of this type in 
our country. There is experience in mobilization of the economy, 
experience in the state of emergency, experience when five 
million soldiers were demobilized in several years and all were 
found employment and placed without any nervous shock. However, 
the current authorities are afraid to turn to this experience, 
because its vehicles are the leaders and members of the CPSU. 
  [Correspondent] In response to the question: Can the 
communist party today present a clear-cut program which the 
people can understand, i.e., can it utilize the effect of 
Ulyanov-Zhirinovskiy, Gennadiy Andreyevich answers immediately: 
  [Zyuganov] Today the party cannot present such simple and 
energetic slogans as in 1917. There are no simple solutions in 
today's Russia. In short: A change of course is needed. We must 
have a professional government. We must return Russia to its 
geopolitical boundaries--not by means of war, but by means of 
gradual restoration of all ties. In general, these are strictly 
all-national things. 
  I have thought about the fact that I could become president. 
The leader of a large parliamentary party (and yesterday at the 
meeting even Shumeyko admitted that the communist party is one 
of the most authoritative) cannot exclude such a possibility. If 
the party deems it necessary and the circumstances are 
right--well... Although I am opposed to the institution of the 
presidency itself. 
  [Correspondent] Here is Gennadiy Andreyevich's prediction in 
the case if the evolutionary transition from a government of 
radicals to a government of new wave communists does not occur: 
  [Zyuganov] A regional stratification of Russia is going on. 
The severity of the crisis is being thrown into the agrarian 
regions and those whose products do not go for export. Russia is 
ever more reproducing the system of "first world--third world," 
with a specific enclave which is becoming ever richer--Moscow, 
where the commercial and bank capital and the bureaucracy are 
concentrated. In order to support such an explosive system, we 
need a roll-back not simply to the command dictate, but to the 
archaic forms of existence. Moscow is introducing the visa 
regimen, and militia guards will collect duty at the city gates 
from citizens wishing to visit the capital. Well, is this not 
the early middle ages?! 
  [Correspondent] There has been an acute desire to restore 
the 
disintegrated connection of the times (this is one of the 
methods of assimilating the world, especially by any new 
communists). And they have restored it: 
  Now it is night in the courtyard. It is dark, not a 
soul anywhere. I write... But on the desk is a new appeal: 
"Comrades, come to your senses. We are bringing you the true 
light of socialism! Leave your drunken gangs, conquer the 
parasites once and for all! Leave the suffocator of the popular 
masses, the former excise advisor Grigoryev! He is suffering 
from a bout of hard drinking. He is a hireling of the Entente, 
and has a house in Yelizavetgrad!" This is 1920, Bunin, "The 
Accursed Days."

<F P=106> [Article by Kirill Varov: "Did Kashpirovskiy Send </F>
Zhirinovskiy?"] 
  [Text] In the style of recent days, psychotherapist 
A. Kashpirovskiy, who has been abroad across the ocean for many 
months, addressed the State Duma with his own message, informing 
it from far-off America of his intention to leave the membership 
of the parliamentary faction of the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic 
Party of Russia]. 
  During the pre-electoral campaign, much ink was spilled over 
the somewhat strange alliance between the first Russian liberal, 
V. V. Zhirinovskiy, and the television hypnotist who 
successfully rid progressive mankind of enuresis [incontinency]. 
There was even some talk that Kashpirovskiy either secretly 
hypnotized voters or, at least, taught V. V. Zhirinovskiy the 
art of giving a post-hypnotic suggestion from the television 
screen. 
  Now, however, the correspondence-deputy A. Kashpirovskiy, as 
they affirm, has seen the light, seeing, in his words, the 
contrast between the pre-electoral program of the LDPR which was 
humane in its essenceand the provocational position of its 
leader, V. V. Zhirinovskiy. He, Kashpirovskiy, they say, was 
always totally in favor of respect for national and religious 
rights, of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of foreign 
states, and of free education and medical care. Zhirinovskiy, 
however, having reneged on his former promises, preaches 
national intolerance, sows dissention and provokes military 
conflicts. In short, Kashpirovskiy has decided to divorce 
himself not so much from the LDPR as from V. V. Zhirinovskiy, 
since the latter has betrayed the declared ideals. However, 
today one does not exist without the other, and that, evidently, 
is why Kashpirovskiy is leaving the liberal-democratic faction. 
As it became clear, if the psychotherapist had known that 
departure from the faction does not mean automatic expulsion 
from the State Duma, he would have taken this step long ago. It 
turns out that even prophets are not given everything to know. 
  Then again, we cannot exclude the possibility that 
Kashpirovskiy simply wants to call attention to himself once 
again, in the style of that very same Zhirinovskiy.

<F P=106> [Article by Yakov Nikolayev: "`Chechen Party': A Game at Two </F>
Tables"] 
  [Text] Two groups of high-ranking Moscow politicians, 
separately and independently of each other, are conducting 
confidential negotiations with two feuding Chechen groups. The 
aim of the negotiations is the return of Chechnya to the bosom 
of the Federation. 
  The Ministry of the Russian Federation on Nationality 
Affairs, headed by Sergey Shakhray and joined by the leadership 
of the Federation Council (first fiddle in this group is played 
by Deputy Speaker Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy in the 
recent past and a person who is generally close to Shakhray), is 
building bridges with the Chechen irreconcilable opposition, 
which promises Moscow numerous concessions but which cannot make 
them at present, because it does not now have the power. At the 
same time, the administration of the president of Russia, headed 
by Sergey Filatov, is trying to fix relations with Dzhokhar 
Dudayev, the head of the Chechen Republic, who in words does not 
intend to give up sovereignty, but who is really prepared to 
accept certain sacrifices. 
  The "dual diplomacy" in the relationship with the prodigal 
component of the Federation is explained, evidently, by the fact 
that Moscow does not understand very well "who is who" in 
Groznyy. Filatov and his subordinates emphasize that their 
partners can only be representatives of the official authorities 
of Chechnya, and they transparently hint at an alleged planned 
meeting of the two presidents (a success about which Dudayev can 
only dream at present). Shakhray, in turn, is cautiously 
insisting that it is impossible to come to an agreement with 
Dudayev, and that it is necessary to rely on "other 
sociopolitical forces in the republic," which, incidentally, are 
thinking of and preparing for a violent overthrow of the Chechen 
president. 
  In addition, third persons are also wedging their way into 
the negotiating process. Thus, Viktor Chernomyrdin recently, 
without consulting anyone and without going into an analysis of 
the Russian-Chechen mess, received the Deputy Prime Minister 
Mugodayev of the Dudayev government (with whom our prime 
minister, according to information of the Chechen opposition, 
was personally acquainted when Mugodayev was chief of 
Groztrubprovodstroy) and settled certain problems of the Groznyy 
oil refinery plant and of a number of other local enterprises. 
It is possible that the fate of budgetary money earmarked at one 
time for Chechnya was decided in the course of this rendezvous. 
As was disclosed by an OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist from reliable 
sources in the government, a year ago Shakhray, being the deputy 
prime minister at that time, did everything so that this money 
did not fall into Dudayev's hands. Today, Sergey Mikhaylovich, 
reduced to the rank of minister, cannot control budgetary 
expenditures. A competent source expressed the supposition that 
Mugodayev, with the blessing of Chernomyrdin, took at least a 
part of the billions held up in Moscow with him to Groznyy. 
  In the meantime, the Chechen oppositionists, who have 
penetrated the Russian corridors of power, were also counting on 
this sum. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist found out about this 
directly from the leaders of the Provisional Soviet opposed to 
Dudayev. (Officials in the White House refuse to give any kind 
of specific information about the negotiations with Chechnya.) 
  Leaders of the opposition arrived in the Russian capital 
with 
a draft agreement with the Government of the Russian Federation. 
They are asking to be helped materially (for which a "Chechen" 
line in the budget could be suitable) and to recognize them as 
the legal authority in Chechnya. On their part, they pledge 
themselves to overthrow the present regime, to organize 
parliamentary elections, and to transform the republic into a 
valuable component of the Federation. According to the words of 
the Groznyy insurgents, Shakhray and Abdulatipov "met their 
proposals with understanding." Chairman of the Federation 
Council Vladimir Shumeyko, responding to a question of an 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist, declared that "it is necessary to 
wait and see who is more ready for negotiations--Dudayev or the 
Provisional Soviet." 
  But in seeking the laurels of peaceful victors in rebellious 
Chechnya, the Shakhray-Abdulatipov group is being hindered by 
the "competing firm" of Filatov. As has been reported, at the 
beginning of March, Filatov, while in Nalchik, met with a 
representative of the Chechen authorities. This was an official 
from the department of Dudayev's state secretary, Aslanbek 
Akbulatov, whose name the Kremlin sources did not want to 
mention, and the Chechen oppositionists could not recall, but it 
is clear that the rank of this "emissary" did not in any way 
equate to the level of his interlocutor. However, Dudayev is 
prepared in the future to detail Akbulatov himself--formally the 
third person in the republic, and not too influential in 
internal affairs--to the negotiations with a Russian emissary. 
  The concepts of the sides on the subject of future dialogues 
still differ significantly. The Kremlin intends to sign a treaty 
with Groznyy on the division of powers and subjects of 
jurisdiction similar to the Russian-Tatar treaty. Dudayev issued 
instructions to conduct negotiations only "about improving 
relations with Russia." However, informed persons in Groznyy 
think that the general is ready for concessions on the condition 
of keeping his post and the share of profits that the export of 
petroleum products will bring to the republic. These profits, in 
the words of those same informants, constitute the basis of the 
prosperity of the Groznyy establishment, and it is precisely 
about the size of the export quotas that Mugodayev was haggling 
with Chernomyrdin. 
  Considering that Dudayev has lost control over a significant 
part of the territory, and that the opposition is arming itself 
intensely, the Groznyy leader really can become a very tractable 
partner. Of course, in this case, he certainly will run into the 
accusation of betraying the cause of national independence, but 
here it is already necessary to make a choice: either power or 
reputation. 
  On the whole, the Chechen situation is reminiscent of the 
finale of the "Gamsakhurdia epoch" in Georgia. Of course, the 
local opposition lacks its own Shevardnadze. Doku Zavgayev, the 
former first secretary of the oblast party committee and 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Checheno-Ingushetia, has 
retired and does not wish to involve himself in anything. Ruslan 
Khasbulatov, who was released from prison under the amnesty, 
could satisfy the insurgents as a person who enjoys popularity 
in the republic, but the former speaker categorically is not 
suitable for negotiations not only with Yeltsin, but also 
Chernomyrdin, and even with Shakhray. The head of the so-called 
alternative "government of national trust," billionaire Yaragi 
Mamodayev, who did not share last year's income from exports 
with Dudayev and who emigrated to Moscow, does not have 
authority among the opposition, and his whole government 
consists of himself alone. Salambek Khadzhiyev, the former 
minister of the USSR oil industry, is more fit than others for 
the role of future national leader, but he also is not in a 
hurry to join in the implementation of the "revolutionary" plans 
of his countrymen, and he is taking a wait-and-see position. 
  Moscow could more successfully play on the confrontation of 
Dudayev and the opposition, pushing the leader to concessions 
and simultaneously encouraging the activeness of his opponents. 
But this is being hindered by the misalignment in the actions of 
Russian authorities and the rivalry between the high-ranking 
"negotiators" who do not trust one another. Such a situation 
pleases Dudayev most of all: He keeps political and economic 
power in his hands, he feeds Filatov and his team indefinite 
promises of some kind of a future treaty with Moscow, but at the 
same time he haggles with the Government of the Russian 
Federation about the distribution of profits from trade in 
"sovereign" Chechen oil products.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Aushev, by Vakhtang Dzhanashiya, </F>
under rubric "Ingushetia": "President Aushev: `The Ingush Want 
To Have What Is Theirs Returned'"] 
  [Text] For the second time Hero of the Soviet Union 
Ruslan Aushev has been elected president of Ingushetia. What is 
his political program? 
  [Dzhanashiya] Practically speaking, it is not realistic to 
talk about Ingushetia without touching upon the question of 
Prigorodnyy Rayon... 
  [Aushev] We have stated in our constitution that the 
returning of land that was illegally seized from Ingushetia is 
state policy. And we intend to resolve this problem only by 
political means. 
  Yes, today that part of Prigorodnyy Rayon where the Ingush 
used to live and from which they were deported is under the 
legal jurisdiction of North Ossetia. But I believe that, in the 
final analysis, we shall convince even the residents of North 
Ossetia themselves that it is impossible to live by taking what 
is needed. 
  And when people say that the Ingush have territorial claims, 
that is untrue. The Ingush do not have any territorial claims 
against anyone. The Ingush say, "Return to us what was taken 
away in 1944." 
  I feel that the Constitutional Court must say its weighty 
word about who is right and who is guilty. At least it can say 
whether the Ingush are right or are not right, whether their 
demands are just or unjust, and whether the question is being 
raised correctly or incorrectly. It is not just a matter of 
territory, but also of human rights. 
  [Dzhanashiya] But let's be realists: the people in the 
Russian Ministry of Defense are mostly interested in allowing 
North Ossetia to keep Prigorodnyy Rayon. The strategic Military 
Georgian Road runs through part of Prigorodnyy Rayon. 
  [Aushev] Then let them declare that the Military Georgian 
Road, by virtue of its strategic importance, is federal 
property. We do not reject that! 
  [Dzhanashiya] Refugees are a serious destabilizing factor. 
With increasing frequency we hear voices saying that the 
republic leadership is incapable of resolving the problems of 
the Ingush nation... 
  [Aushev] The reason why the conflict arose was to drag out 
the resolution of the territorial problem. And to "hang onto" it 
the problems of the refugees, the restoration of housing, the 
people who have vanished without a trace, etc., etc. The tasks 
were clearly formulated when the provocation was being prepared. 
  [Dzhanashiya] You mentioned provocation... Who had an 
interest in that? 
  [Aushev] (Laughter.) As they say in political language, 
"definite political forces."... In Moscow the opinion has 
developed that Prigorodnyy Rayon must be given back to the 
Ingush. In Vladikavkaz, people understood that this must somehow 
be disrupted. Two circumstances came together: Ossetia has to 
understand the Ingush, and the center has to understand 
Chechnya. It was hoped in the center that Chechnya would go to 
the assistance of the Ingush. And, consequently, the Chechen 
side could be accused of aggression and the "Chechen question" 
could be resolved by military means. However, Dzhokhar Dudayev 
make an official declaration of neutrality. 
  [Dzhanashiya] The economic situation in the republic is 
catastrophic. Unemployment is fantastic... 
  [Aushev] Yes, 56 percent of the able-bodied population are 
unemployed. Ingushetia has been fighting for survival during its 
entire history. So people have learned how to feed their family 
without governmental assistance. A year and a half after the 
formation of the Chechen Republic, everyone has forgotten about 
Ingushetia -- but we have survived. 
  Currently the question of creating an economically favorable 
zone is being decided. Reform of agriculture has been begun. The 
land is rich and has high harvest yields. We have our own 
petroleum, and it is sufficient for us. It is necessary to 
engage in the development of the petroleum complex. To create 
small and medium-sized enterprises on the basis of the latest 
technologies. Small repair and processing shops, etc. Does 
anyone think that we will not feed 300,000 people? Of course 
we'll feed them! 
  And we must keep on learning and learning. And use force to 
make anyone learn if he does not want to. We must send our young 
people absolutely everywhere -- to whatever countries, 
republics, regions -- just so that they can learn. To turn the 
republic into a republic. 
  [Dzhanashiya] The traditional teyp (kinship clan) 
structure of society is preserved in Ingushetia. How do you view 
the reformation of that structure? 
  [Aushev] I feel that in the teyps there is much 
that is good. Many people are disciplined by the fact that it is 
necessary to answer to their own and other teyps. 
Life itself will change the teyp system of Ingush 
society. Today many traditions are being broken. When a person 
becomes a private property owner, he will not need either a 
teyp or anything else. 
  [Dzhanashiya] The Aushev teyp is a respected one, 
but not one of the traditionally first ones. Doesn't there arise 
a disbalance between your present position and the vanities of 
certain leaders of the traditionally strong teyps? 
  [Aushev] Absolutely not. I have taken a stand above all 
teyps, above all my relatives: the president must be 
neutral. They themselves say, "You're not an Aushev. You're the 
president of Ingushetia." And I agree with that. 
  [Dzhanashiya] The Ingush used to have one seat in the State 
Duma. In the election you supported Aleksandra Momdzhyan, an 
outsider and the wife of your friend General Ochirov... 
  [Aushev] We based our decision on the fact that the Duma is 
elected for a two-year period. In this kind of situation there 
is no time to wait for someone to learn how to operate, to wait 
until a candidate becomes a deputy. Work of creating legislation 
is difficult and requires certain skills. Aleksandra is a 
well-known specialist and a doctor of sciences. As for her 
nationality, what difference does it make? I am happy that the 
Ingush have once again demonstrated their internationalism. 
  [Biographical note] Ruslan Sultanovich Aushev was born on 29 
October 1954 in the village of Volodarskoye, Kokchetav Oblast, 
in the family of persons who had been repressed. Graduated from 
Ordzhonokidze Higher Combined-Arms Command School and, with 
distinction, the Military Academy imeni M. V. Frunze. Served in 
the troops of the North Caucasus and Turkestan military 
districts. From 1980 through 1982 and from 1985 through 1987 was 
in Afghanistan. Hero of the Soviet Union since 1982. Major 
General Ruslan Aushev was elected USSR people's deputy. Chairman 
of the intergovernmental Committee on Affairs of 
Internationalist Fighting Men, under the Council of Heads of 
Governments of the States Participating in the Community. Since 
February 1993, president of the Ingush Republic. Married, with 
two children.

<F P=106> [Article by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent Andrey Knyazev </F>
under the rubric "Versions": "Who Is Playing the Card of the 
Urals Republic?"] 
  [Text] While visiting Yekaterinburg, ARGUMENTY I 
FAKTY correspondent Andrey Knyazev heard several versions of the 
declaration of the Urals Republic and the subsequent dismissal 
of administration head Eduard Rossel. 
  The first version is promoted by Rossel himself, 
his supporters, and the residents who actively endorsed the 
republic's constitution. It goes like this. Unless the 
issue of regional independence is resolved, Russia will not move 
forward and the economic situation will remain in a dead end. 
The main task is to raise the oblast's status, wrangling the 
necessary economic rights from Moscow. Rossel and his 
confederates' assumption is that Russia could be managed from 
Moscow in the environment of a rigid unitary state. Under a free 
market system, however, all 89 Federation components must be 
given the necessary degree of freedom to conduct economic reform 
on their own. 
  Eduard Rossel states categorically that Yeltsin was not told 
in advance of the decision; as to the creator of the Urals 
Republic constitution, he had no desire to join Sverdlovsk 
Oblast with other Urals oblasts. 
  According to the second version, which is 
supported by the Russian president's representative in the 
oblast, Vitaliy Mashkov, as well as the intellectual elite not 
connected to commercial structures, the declaration of the 
Urals Republic is nothing other than the desire to have 
decisionmaking power on all matters regarding selling the Urals' 
riches, bypassing Moscow. This is an easier way to enrich 
oneself and squander the national wealth. 
  That is why Rossel's idea was so eagerly welcomed by 
businessmen experienced in setting up join enterprises with 
foreign companies. There are many facts pointing to the 
existence of a clan with a stake in this outcome. Members of 
this clan work not only in Yekaterinburg but also in state and 
entrepreneurial structures in Russia. 
  Finally, the third version, which many ordinary 
Yekaterinburg residents are inclined to accept. The Urals 
Republic was a sacrifice card in Moscow's political game with 
Russia's ethnic entities. First federal authorities wanted 
to warn Tatarstan, Tuva, and other former autonomies against 
becoming too independent. When the situation with the Urals 
Republic went too far, however, they decided to reshuffle the 
deck. Rossel got too carried away with the idea and became an 
irritant for many people. 
  Meanwhile, Eduard Ergartovich himself hopes for success and 
the support of leaders of other oblasts. As to leaflets with the 
Urals Republic constitution, they were popular among the 
Federation Council deputies--heads of oblast and kray 
administration. One cannot rule out that in the near future 
there may be a Central Russian, Volgo-Vyatka, Siberian, Far 
East, and other republics on the map of Russia.
