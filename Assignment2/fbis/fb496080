<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation Minister </F>
for National and Regional Policy Affairs, conducted by Anatoliy 
Oreshchuk, date and place not given: "The Regions Are Asking for 
Rubles"] 
  [Text] It would seem that the problem which served as 
grounds for the conversation with Russian Federation Minister 
for National and Regional Policy Affairs Sergey Shakhray does 
not directly concern the department which he heads--the 
disastrous position of pensioners in Russia, especially in those 
regions which are claiming independence. 
  [Question] Sergey Mikhaylovich, there are many very anxious 
letters in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA's mail from pensioners, especially 
from the "sovereign" territories. 
  [Answer] Pension guarantees really do not directly relate to 
the problems of our ministry. But I am not surprised that you 
are asking me this question. I cannot help but recognize that 
the disastrous position of pensioners is an all-Russian 
calamity. And it is even broader if one recalls the position of 
our fellow countrymen, especially pensioners in the so-called 
near abroad. One wants to exclaim: Look how these people live 
today! Do you want to live that way tomorrow? 
  In my time I more than once raised the problem of pension 
guarantees in the country. I was concerned and am concerned 
most of all about the situation in the "hot spots," in regions 
of interethnic conflict. 
  The Ministry of National and Regional Policy Affairs 
receives, for example, hundreds of letters from pensioners in 
Chechnya. For a year they have not been able to receive their 
humble pensions. It is impossible to read these appeals without 
an ache in your heart. People write who have worked for decades 
for the good of our Fatherland. Many of them whose health was 
undermined during the Stalinist years when they experienced 
deportation or lived in exile. Why are they being punished 
again--now in their old age?! What kind of price is this for 
the Law on the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples? 
  As a politician, a jurist and simply as a person I see the 
task of our leaders, the task of reform as creating a society in 
which each citizen would be reliably protected from accidental 
occurrences, would be guaranteed a peaceful old age. 
  [Question] You are saying that you have raised the question 
of pension guarantees more than once. What happened? Did you 
achieve anything? Is it the same as Chechnya in other republics? 
  [Answer] What is the reason for the nonpayment of pensions 
in 
Chechnya? It is simple to open the coffer but the key to it is 
in the pocket of the politicians or pseudopoliticians, whichever 
you prefer. 
  The system of pension guarantees, simply speaking, is built 
on the basis of mutual credits of the generations. We use the 
fruits of our labor for those who are now, as they say, on a 
well-earned vacation, but a pension is paid to them from the 
pocket of those who are working today, by deductions of taxes 
into the Pension Fund. There is one fund for the whole country 
but each republic or each oblast has its own branches where they 
receive deductions from enterprises and local organizations. 
  It would seem that nothing could be simpler: the money 
arrives in the local branch of the fund and the local pensions 
are paid. But everything is much more complicated. In many 
regions the receipts do not cover the demands for payment. Here 
the better-off regions (more tax-intensive, if it can be 
expressed that way) come to help them, whose deductions enter 
the federal Pension Fund and the corresponding subsidies are 
distributed. 
  Thus here is interdependence. Now imagine that one of these 
republics, especially a subsidized one, declares its 
sovereignty. But why imagine? This is precisely what Chechnya 
did. And the National Bank of the Chechen Republic unilateraly 
severed its relations with the Russian Federation Central Bank 
and was no longer able to finance these expenditures from the 
Russian Federation Pension Fund. What that led to, we have 
already talked about. 
  In the beginning of 1993 Chechnya was allotted 2.5 billion 
rubles [R] to pay pensions. 
  [Question] Did this resolve the problem? 
  [Answer] Of course it did not resolve it. They stopped 
talking about this fact itself, and I think that not even all 
the pensioners in Chechnya suspect it. 
  And although the money finally reached them, we together 
with 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Social Security and the 
Pension Fund adopted a decision allowing the Russian social 
security organs to pay pensions until the normalization of the 
situation in Chechny, excluding pensions to inhabitants of the 
given republic outside its borders. 
  In order to receive the money due them, the pensioners 
living 
in Chechnya have to appeal to the social security organs of any 
region of Russia. 
  Of course, this is not a way out. It is possible that the 
latest decisions of the Duma will help stabilize the situation. 
  Here it is appropriate to say that it would seem that for 
our 
ministry the particular part of the problem of nonpayment of 
pensions in Chechnya focuses on a whole complex of complicated 
tasks. Millions of Russian citizens are living in other regions 
outside of legal and social security. 
  I have to say that for more than three years the Russian 
Federation Constitution, laws or Russian legality have not 
existed on the territory of Tatarstan. In essence, Russia's 
general state sovereignty has not been disseminated in Tatarstan. 
  Now we have concluded a well known treaty with Tatarstan. 
Has it removed all the problems? I don't think so. Has it 
eased the situation? Yes, it has eased it. In any case, it gave 
us the possibility to remove the formal contradictions between 
the constitutions and provides a legal basis for resolving other 
disputed issues. 
  In a word, it is necessary to actively seek ways out of 
situations that at first glance seem to be dead ends. 
  [Question] In general how much is it possible to influence 
the state of affairs under the current conditions? How do you 
influence, let's say, the course of elections to local organs of 
power which are collapsing in a whole number of regions? What 
do the facts about the confrontation between elected and 
appointed representatives of power say about this? 
  [Answer] You are asking questions for which there are no 
simple answers. They are all interconnected. Let's take them 
in order. Yes, elections to the local organs of power are 
proceeding with difficulty. 
  It is obvious that the facts about opposition to the 
representatives of executive power in local areas reflect 
negatively on the preparation for the elections. Let's say that 
in Yaroslavl Oblast the administration ratified the decree "On 
Organs of Local Power..." only on 20 December and then three 
times, up until 8 February, changes were introduced into it. 
The President's representative proposed holding the elections 
of organs of local self-government (except for the oblast duma) 
in the autumn. As a result of the elections 17 out of 23 
districts made up the oblast duma. In six districts they were 
disrupted due to the [neivka?] of the voters. In Yaroslavl, 
Uglich and Tutayev the dumas will work without a full complement. 
  I think that problems of local self-government are now 
coming 
into the forefront. It is precisely on this level that we can 
and should resolve many questions inlcuding those that are 
national in their essence and in their form. We in the ministry 
are creating a department on issues of local self-government. 
  [Question] Sergey Mikhaylovich, it is the general opinion 
that you are one of the most mobile politicians and that more 
often than the others you are in the local areas. How do you 
evaluate the situation in Russia as a whole? 
  [Answer] The general situation in the Russian Federation can 
be evaluated in two ways. On one hand the government and 
society have recognized the failure of shock therapy. On the 
other hand, it is reassuring that a realistic way out of the 
dead end has been outlined in the president's messages and in 
the program of the government leaders. 
  This course toward the social orientation of economic 
policy, 
stabilization of production, its structural restructuring, 
serious anti-inflationary measures and federalization of Russia 
is opening up the potential of the Russian regions and is the 
only way of maintaining the integrity of the Russian state. 
  Unfortunately, political instability is being maintained. 
Disinformation about some kind of plot is being spread, which 
further destabilizes the situation in society. 
  [Question] This is your first appearance in RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA as a minister. Therefore, please, say a few words about 
the tasks of your ministry. 
  [Answer] Structurally we divide them into three large blocs. 
The first of these is nationality affairs: repressed and 
deported peoples, problems of the Russian Germans, a program for 
rebirth of the peoples of Russia which the Supreme Soviet 
Council of Nationalities is still working on. It needs to be 
implemented. 
  The second bloc is purely regional policy in its financial 
and economic sense. We will create interdepartment structures 
jointly with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of 
Economics to deal with oblast, kray, and republic budgets and 
the siting of production forces, and to create funds for 
supporting the regions. Without real financial resources we 
cannot launch one program, cannot resolve one national conflict. 
  The third bloc touches on regional policy but is also 
sufficiently autonomous. It is the the North. Problems of its 
socioeconomic development, small peoples, maintenance of its 
ecological assets and traditional ways of life. 
  Much can be said about our plans and ways to realize them, 
but I think that there will still be possibilities to meet with 
the readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. 
  [Interviewer ends] Of course.

<F P=106> [Article by Lyudmila Dmitriyevskaya, chairman of the </F>
presidium of the Collegium of Lawyers of the Republic of 
Tatarstan, and Rashid Teunayev, chairman of the presidium of the 
Collegium of Lawyers of the Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia: 
"What Will Happen With Regional Economic Reform? It Must Be 
Reinforced by the Legislative Capabilities of the Components of 
the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Point of View </H5>
  Russian federalism represents a rather motley and in many 
places a still poorly painted picture that is too early to 
remove from the easel to show at prestigious exhibitions. We are 
fully in agreement with statements (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 5 
March 1994) about the three pillars that will enable a new 
Russia to sail out of the current political and economic storm: 
a socially oriented market economy, local self-government, and 
federalism, but we cannot fail to note that such statements are 
still not being reinforced by real assistance to the regions in 
the sphere of an independent legal structure. The last is 
exactly the most fundamental question of a real and not feigned 
attitude toward the rights of the regions. 
  In accordance with the new Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, federal state property and its management, the 
establishment of legal principles of a single market, the 
federal banks, and civic legislation fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Russian Federation (Article 71). 
Administrative, labor, family, housing, land, water, and 
forestry legislation, and legislation on mineral resources, on 
the legal profession, and on the notary system are within the 
joint jurisdiction of the Federation and its components (Article 
72). Components of the Federation possess absolute state 
authority (Article 73) outside the bounds of jurisdiction of the 
Russian Federation and the powers of the Russian Federation on 
subjects of joint jurisdiction. 
  It is apparent from the aforementioned that the Constitution 
leaves to the components of the Federation extensive 
opportunities to legislate in the sphere of commercial legal 
relations that were previously regulated by the officially 
recognized branch of economic law, and also by branches of 
entrepreneurial and trade law that were previously unknown to 
the socialist legal system; moreover, all of them relate to the 
competence of the regions. The treaty between the Russian 
Federation and Tatarstan showed that a whole series of powers 
relating to the exclusive or joint jurisdiction of the Russian 
Federation, but specifically questions of ownership, the use and 
disposition of lands, mineral resources, forests and other 
natural resources, state enterprises, other personal property 
and real estate, the legal profession, the notary system, the 
legal regulation of administrative, family and housing 
relations, wildlife management, and others--all of these are 
transferred to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  It is superfluous to mention that the right to legislate 
independently in the aforementioned sphere of competence of 
components of the Federation is extremely important for those 
regions that are endeavoring to create a legal regime that is 
favorable for domestic and foreign investors and to ensure the 
acceleration of their movement to a civilized market with the 
help of modern methods of legal regulation. The need for the 
regions to legislate legal relations assigned to them by the 
Constitution in the sphere of property is especially important 
against the background of the weak activity of the center in the 
sphere of economic legislation. Up to the present time, basic 
laws on joint-stock companies and associations, securities, 
trade turnover, and rent have not been passed yet. A full draft 
of the Civil Code has not been submitted to date, and there are 
only unfounded rumors about work on the Trade Code. The federal 
laws in force in the sphere of property relations are weakly 
developed, or outdated and contain numerous unclear points and 
contradictions. Under such conditions, federalism throughout the 
world ensures filling in the gaps with the help of legislation 
of the components of the Federation. As practical jurists, we 
especially note the need for energetic law-drafting work at the 
regional level. 
  At the same time, we must note with alarm that an attempt is 
being made to subject the constitutional rights of the 
components of the Federation to revision with the adoption of 
other federal legislation. Thus, in Articles 2 and 3 of the 
widely advertised draft of the general part of the Civil Code of 
the Russian Federation, the concepts of "civil law" and "civil 
legislation" are used in such a broad sense that the possibility 
is legally and actually closed to the components of the 
Federation to legislate in the economic sphere even within the 
framework of its constitutional competence. Similar claims are 
confirmed by statements of the developers of the draft of the 
general part of the Civil Code that the sphere of action of 
civil law has been substantially broadened, absorbing, for 
example, land legal relations that now, they say, can be 
regulated only by the Civil Code and federal laws. These authors 
of the draft of the general part of the Civil Code categorically 
deny the republics that are in the Russian Federation structure 
the right to adopt such complex normative acts like codes, 
declaring this to be an "obvious unconstitutionality and 
elementary ignorance." 
  If it were a question of a purely academic discussion, we 
who 
are responsible for practical questions of the application of 
the law would simply not have the time to take part in it. But 
here we run into a different situation. After all, a Forest Code 
was adopted in Altay, a Trade Turnover Code in Kalmykia, and 
intensive work is proceeding in other regions on the development 
of their own legal bases. Therefore, we would perceive an 
obvious unconstitutionality and elementary indiscretion in 
statements like those cited above, but we are faced with more 
practical tasks. Therefore, we would like to advise the authors 
of the draft Civil Code to submit it as a matter of priority to 
the legal community in its entirety; that is, not just the 
general but also the special part, so that the quality of the 
work will be more evident to everyone, and also to include in 
the draft Civil Code appropriate limitations on the sphere of 
the civil legislation defined by the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation and the federal treaty between the Russian Federation 
and Tatarstan as a precedent for similar treaties with other 
components of the Federation. If this is not done, the Federal 
Assembly will have to carefully examine with a similar 
independent effort the review of a still delicate balance of 
constitutional mutual relations between the center and the 
regions in the sphere of legislation. The heads of regions and 
their legislative organs should also pay attention to the 
unfolding situation. It is simply difficult for us, for example, 
to imagine what a young progressive lawyer could do in the post 
of president of Chuvashia on the advice of a well-known 
progressive economist in that limited leeway that is outlined 
for the components of the Federation in the draft of the general 
part of the Civil Code. 
  Everyone in the regions is ready to act within the framework 
of the general rules of a single market, but they are not ready, 
and will never be ready, for petty regulating from Moscow of our 
very different conditions of economic life.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov: "Government Officials Have Turned </F>
to the North, but They Cannot Face It"] 
  [Text] The FITUR held its fourth conference on the 
issues of northerners. According to speakers, if it were not for 
the support of the trade unions, neither the issues nor the 
northerners would exist. 
<H5>  How the Law Was "Frozen" </H5>
  Sometimes numbers are more eloquent than lengthy 
descriptions, and enough of them were cited at the conference. 
What does the North mean to Russia? It produces more than 75 
percent of Russia's oil, 92 percent of its gas, 100 percent of 
its gold and diamonds, and 70 percent of its timber and wood 
products--in all, one-fifth of its treasury revenue. Each 
northerner provides the state with three times as much income as 
the "average" Russian. 
  Here is another statistic: Residents of the North represent 
9 
percent of the laboring public but are responsible for 60 
percent of the country's foreign currency receipts. 
  In spite of this, they are in need! They have been 
humiliated 
and offended. Conference speakers remarked that Sakhalin was 
once a tsarist labor camp and has returned to that state. 
Speakers from Vorkuta made references to the Stalinist camps.... 
  Excuse me, I wanted to ask the speakers, what about the 
labor 
heroism of the past, the taming of the wild oil fields, and the 
development of the gas deposits? All of this was not a delusion; 
it was not communist propaganda--it was a fact. There are 
witnesses and participants right here in this auditorium. 
  When FITUR Chairman Mikhail Shmakov called the conference to 
order, he did not make disparaging remarks about the past or 
malign the innocent intentions of people, as today's ideologists 
are so regrettably inclined to do. He used statistics to make 
his point. 
  Whereas just 5-10 years ago the North was the recipient of 
10-20 percent of all annual state capital investments, the 
transition to self-financing drove enterprises there to the 
verge of ruin. Capital investments decreased by 11 percent in 
1991, 40 percent in 1992, and more than 20 percent last year. We 
are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs. This metaphor, 
incidentally, was used by several speakers. 
  Emissaries from Sakhalin, the Komi Republic, Tyumen and 
Magadan oblasts, and Norilsk spoke at the conference. They 
brought the grievances of their people to Moscow: Conscientious 
workers are not being paid the money they have earned, and the 
rise in the cost of living is choking them and driving them away 
from the North. The hostages cannot even reach the "mainland," 
however, because they do not have the money to make the trip, 
and their own state has not bothered to provide them with 
shelter. 
  Under pressure from trade unions, several decrees, laws, and 
edicts were passed for the protection of the northerners, but 
everyone knows what they were worth. The Law on Guarantees and 
Compensation specified allocations of 560 billion rubles last 
year, but the government could only part with 158 billion. 
<H5>  No Need for Panic </H5>
  There have been several reports in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the 
trade unions' stance on the northern regions. It was interesting 
to hear the government's side. One of the speakers at the 
conference was First Deputy Minister for Nationalities Affairs 
and Regional Policy Vladimir Kuramin. He is not a neutral party; 
he took part in developing the northern oil and gas resources of 
the Tyumen region. He did not dodge the issue or embellish the 
facts: He admitted that the recession was more severe in the 
North last year than in the Russian Federation as a whole. 
  If the situation is not corrected soon, V. Kuramin went on 
to 
say, this region with its unique resource potential will become 
a factor contributing to the rapid disintegration of the Russian 
economy. 
  Nevertheless, even for the sake of a good story, we cannot 
say that the northerners have been completely abandoned to the 
whims of fate. Housing is being built, for example, in 22 
oblasts in central Russia for people who have worked in the 
North for 10 years or more. 
  The provision of the North with food, consumer goods, fuel, 
and other material and technical resources is a matter of 
special concern. Delivery goals were essentially attained last 
year and the year before. 
  The Law on State Guarantees and Compensation has also 
provided northerners with some advantages: additional vacation 
time, a shorter work week for women, and the recalculation of 
labor and social pensions. 
  Reimbursement for the cost of regional wage differentials 
and 
bonuses became the stumbling block. The Ministry of Finance 
categorically objected to this. The financiers were horrified by 
the total amount of these expenditures--51.7 trillion rubles. 
They seemed to have forgotten, however, that these expenditures 
are covered not only by the republic budget, but also by the 
pension fund, the social insurance fund, the state public 
employment fund, and local budgets. According to estimates, the 
state's additional expenditures will amount to only 1.3 trillion 
rubles, and the ministry will try to enter this sum in the 
budget as a separate item. 
  Russia's "Northern policy" would be more effective if the 
state were to play a stronger role. The support of the North, 
which is now expressed in isolated impulses, should take the 
form of a comprehensive system of state oversight of the life, 
activity, and development of this promising region. The plans 
for this system have already been drafted and submitted to the 
government. 
<H5>  The Compass Needle </H5>
  True to form, Kuramin laid a solid foundation for the 
debate: 
Government agencies, labor collectives, and trade unions are all 
worried about the future of the North. Unfortunately, all of 
them frequently confine their concern to a search for culprits, 
mutual accusations, and a variety of demands. A concerted search 
for constructive solutions is much more important today. 
  This is what conference participants attempted. The 
suggestion of Chairman Dmitriy Lukashenko of the Komi Republic 
Federation of Trade Union Organizations to "shut down the 
pipelines in the event of trouble" and his appeal for worker 
solidarity in this endeavor did not seem to win any support. 
  Federal Assembly deputies who took part in the discussion of 
northern issues redirected the debate into the channel of 
equitable legal direction of the life of northerners. 
Trade-union leaders insisted on the resolution of urgent 
problems, especially those connected with survival. 
  Furthermore, once a person has decided to return to the 
"mainland," his ability to do this should be guaranteed. 
  Just as the needle in a compass always points to the north, 
all of the participants in the trade-union conference agreed 
that GREAT RUSSIA HAS NO FUTURE WITHOUT THE NORTH.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduard Kondratov, IZVESTIYA: "A House Purchased </F>
With Your Own Savings. In Samara, They Know How To Solve the 
Housing Problem"] 
  [Text] Samara--The Samara Oblast Directorate of 
Statistics has published sensational data. In the environment of 
inflation, nonpayments, and an overall economic recession, the 
construction workers of the oblast have increased the volume of 
output. Last year they built two times (!) more schools than in 
1992, almost twice as many polyclinics, and considerably more 
day care centers. Regarding housing, they added 1,500 
apartments. 
  The demanding, voracious construction market is prompting 
the 
workers to apply themselves with far greater diligence than the 
erstwhile socialist commitments and party instructions. By now, 
as many as one-half of the apartments for residents of Samara 
are provided by private construction cooperatives and companies. 
Their number is nearing 2,000. 
  Three years ago the oblast administration told its 
construction monsters, which were falling apart: You are all 
free, convert to joint-stock operations, split up, look for 
investors with our assistance, and build and sell apartments. At 
first there was shock, but it wore off quickly. Setting 
construction personnel free, the oblast saved itself. Now the 
construction department gives no commands; the strategy for 
carrying out oblast programs and the choice of the most 
advantageous ways to use the taxpayers' money are its business. 
  There is always a selection on the market, especially now 
that the notion of contracts, which was so intrinsic in the life 
of Samara, has resurfaced from oblivion. There was a time when 
construction trusts avoided orders for housing and cultural and 
service facilities like the plague, especially in rural areas. 
At present, all of them are able and willing. 
  The creation of a contract market and regular tenders are 
the 
cherished objective of the local authorities. They select those 
who build cheaper, faster, and offer better quality. They 
persuade the construction industry: "We will come up with 
investment, just keep building." Twenty investment companies 
have already appeared. There will be some appearing in every 
city. 
  Opting for the strategy of market dictate has helped the 
oblast to solve a problem that has forever tormented the 
construction sector--the supply of materials. There was the 
distributive principle--allocations, quotas, schedules of 
orders. They began to forget the cheerless refrain of "we would 
build it, just give us something to build it with" after it was 
proposed that enterprises in need of housing look for 
construction materials themselves. Let us consider bricks, which 
were always in short supply. For example, in 1990 the oblast got 
only 0.5 billion, with demand being 1.2 billion. They had to 
hustle. Some plants took out credit and invested the funds in 
developing old brick plants; others bought or built new ones for 
themselves. At present, the industrial giants of Tolyatti, 
Novokuybyshevsk, and Samara have their own brick plants with 
capacities of 20-50 million bricks. Twelve large brick plants 
which started operating to meet the needs of the population were 
like a life-giving potion healing the old ills of the 
construction industry. 
  They build a lot in Samara, but housing prices are out of 
sight, just like everywhere else. Downtown, each square meter 
costs upward of 800,000 rubles [R], and in the suburbs--about 
R600,000. However, this is what the market is all about. Demand 
is high, and this is why it is expensive. Oilmen, the military, 
and entrepreneurs buy housing at such prices. 
  So far the percentage of those with deep pockets who are 
capable of ordering or buying an apartment is infinitesimal 
here. What is to be done about the 117,000 people on waiting 
lists for housing in Samara alone? It is virtually useless to 
wait for the state to allocate it free of charge. 
  In Samara they saw the following way out of the crisis: 
build 
housing with the funds of the city residents themselves. In the 
summer of 1993 the Samarastroyinvest joint-stock company was 
established in Samara, and its program was granted citywide 
status. Having outrun the locomotive and lacking a legal 
foundation at the time, Samara, jointly with the Housing 
Initiative corporation from Moscow, had begun to courageously 
implement the ideas built into the edict of 24 December 1993 
several months before the appearance of the edict of the 
president of Russia on the development and implementation of 
off-budget financing in the housing sector. Specifically, Samara 
had begun to introduce a mortgage system for extending credit to 
housing construction and to create a housing investment market. 
Construction sites had been selected, contracts signed, and 
special-purpose family accumulation accounts opened. 
  Seven mortgage systems which the city began to implement 
through its joint-stock company offered an overwhelming majority 
of city residents in need of improving their housing conditions 
an opportunity to acquire housing. These were people with 
varying degrees of affluence and varying needs--from those 
ordering luxury chambers to those yearning to eliminate the 
torturous overcrowding that has lasted for years. 
  Nikolay Prokhodtsev, an assistant instructor of the Samara 
Institute of Medicine, who lives with his wife and two children 
in a one-room apartment, said: "My family has finally gotten a 
chance to live in human conditions. All we will have to do is 
work more, and I am confident that we will pay for the new 
housing." 
  The Samarastroyinvest joint-stock company suggested that he 
mortgage his apartment at a mortgage bank at the commercial 
price toward the payment for the future, two-room apartment. The 
difference will be paid in during the number of years specified 
in the contract by obtaining a loan from the bank on credit, 
that is to say, by living in a larger apartment (even the 
building is already known, it is being completed) and working to 
pay for it instead of making money to pay a lump sum for it, 
say, until they are old. 
  The introduction of the mortgage system has produced 
movement 
on the frozen waiting lists at enterprises. The waiting lists 
themselves are being revised, "chains" are being built depending 
on needs. For example, a person who buys a three-room apartment 
pays a proportion of its cost by mortgaging his two-room 
apartment, which is bought by a "one-room" contender. The next 
one in line buys his dwelling. 
  One new apartment sold under a mortgage makes it possible to 
change housing conditions for several people on the waiting list 
at once. Those who do not have housing at all can open family 
accumulation accounts at the bank. The time will come when they, 
taking out a loan, will buy apartments and begin to diligently 
work to pay for them. The plant and insurance companies protect 
them from surprises. 
  Vyacheslav Stepukhin, head of Samarastroyinvest, said: "What 
we are doing is merely a manifestation of local initiative built 
on contracts and by no means a reflection of the actual policy 
of the state." 
  The credit the government has been generously extending to 
this day to raise wages will inevitably inflate the money 
supply, which will drive up prices and exacerbate inflation. Our 
people, fearful of inflation, have stopped saving money--they 
spend it as fast as possible. A state program for housing 
construction under mortgages could tie up enormous amounts of 
funds which are burning holes in the pockets. It would not occur 
to someone to buy a third TV set if everyone is able to invest 
money in his child's future apartment, if a real opportunity to 
live under normal conditions in one's younger years, too, 
appears. 
  Apparently in Samara they thought about this before others. 
The check investment fund Skif has already become involved in 
mortgage banking. Parcels of land are allocated for housing on 
credit and on a noncompetitive basis. Contracts are signed with 
insurance companies. Nonetheless, it is very hard to keep pace 
with the times if the commanders could not care less about this.

<F P=106> [Article by the Press Center of the State Tax Inspectorate </F>
For Smolensk Oblast: "Report From the Tax Inspectorate"] 
  [Text] In 1993 the oblast's state tax inspectorates 
provided for receipts to the budgetary system of taxes and 
mandatory payments in the amount of 225.9 billion rubles, 
including 157.3 billion rubles to the Smolensk Oblast 
budget. 
  In the course of carrying out monitoring work, the tax 
inspectorates established violations of the tax legislation in 
every other enterprise and organization that was audited. They 
revealed instances of understated profit, concealed taxes and 
payments with a consideration of penalty sanctions with a total 
amount of 16.6 billion rubles, which constitutes 14.9 million 
rubles per average scheduled worker in the tax agencies. 
  The largest additional computations were made during the 
audits of the Dvigatel plant in Yartsevo, 1,445,500,000 rubles; 
the Minudobreniya Dorogobuzh AO [joint-stock company], 
527,900,000 rubles; the Almazinstrument Plant in Roslavl, 
256,700,000 rubles; Gnezdovo AO, 165,500,000 rubles; 
Kompleksnyye Dorozhnyye Mashiny AO, 130,600,000 rubles; 
Stroykonstruktsiya AO, 120,500,000 rubles; Smolensk Oblast 
Commercial-Trade Enterprise, 117,400,000 rubles; and 
Smolensknefteprodukty State Enterprise, 87,500,000 rubles. The 
basic reasons for the revealed violations were the poor 
knowledge of the tax legislation by officials at enterprises and 
organizations by physical individuals; their failure to observe 
the proper bookkeeping procedure and the statute dealing with 
the makeup of the expenditures to be considered as production 
costs of output (operations, services) and other normative 
documents and instructional documents; as well as the deliberate 
understatement of the taxable base for purposes of avoiding 
taxation. 
  During 1993, administrative fines amounting to a total of 
66.2 million rubles were levied against 3459 officials at 
enterprises and organizations and 3366 citizens for violations 
of the tax legislation. 
  A total of 15,233 foreign citizens were required to file 
declarations. They were taxed a total of 58.6 million rubles of 
income tax. 
  In 1993 the state tax inspectorates carried out 140 
seminar-conferences with taxpayers, dealing with the procedure 
for application of the tax legislation. More than 300 
explanatory articles were published, and 84 informative talks 
were broadcast by radio.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Gusinskiy, under rubric "Statistics": </F>
"The Year Was Not as Terrible as It Was Painted"] 
  [Text] Somehow we have easily become accustomed to the 
assertion that, with every passing day, life is becoming 
increasingly more difficult. And we even fail to pay very much 
attention to the statistical data which, even if they do not 
speak about the opposite situation, in any case force us to 
subject to doubt the thesis that is being propagandized -- the 
thesis concerning the unbearability of the conditions for 
existence. 
  As is attested to by the data provided by the oblast 
statistics administration, consumer prices of the basic 
commodities and services by December 1992 rose during the year 
that had passed by a factor of 8.1, but the population's 
monetary income during 1993, according to preliminary 
computations, rose, as compared with 1992, by a factor of 9.7. 
During 1993 the average per-capital nominal monetary income with 
respect to the living wage constituted 197 percent (in 1992, 157 
percent). Nevertheless, during last year almost one-fifth of the 
population had a per-capital income lower than the living wage. 
  The situation in the labor market also is not as 
catastrophic 
as is usually depicted. As compared with 1992, last year the 
number of workers in the oblast economy (excluding cooperatives 
and small and private enterprises) dropped by only 2.7 percent. 
As of the beginning of January 1993, employment-service agencies 
had 2800 unemployed citizens on their rolls. During the year 
their number decreased by 24 percent. Eleven hundred people have 
been recognized as being unemployed. 
  As compared with January-November 1992, profit in 1993 
increased by a factor of 8, including 7.5 in industry. But the 
profitability of production in industry was at the level of 
41-44 percent. (For purposes of comparison: according to data in 
BSE [Large Soviet Encyclopedia], the profitability of industry 
in the USSR in 1970 was only 21.5 percent.) True, it was 
achieved as a result of the fact that the enterprises are 
unjustifiably raising the price of their output, which is also 
attested to by statistics: the entire increase in profit last 
year was obtained at the expense of the increase in prices. More 
than 16 percent of all the enterprises and organizations in the 
oblast operated unprofitably in January-November 1993. The 
number of enterprises operating at a loss, as compared with the 
same period in 1992, dropped by 7 percent, although in industry 
their number asincreased by 17 percent. For the oblast as a 
whole, however, in the state sector of the economy the share of 
the enterprises operating at a loss is larger than in the 
nonstate sector, by 3.8 percentage points. 
  Industrial production in 1993 was distinguished by 
instability. The slump in production continued, but by the end 
of the year one could note a tendency toward a slowing down in 
it. Whereas the correlation of the volumes of production during 
the first quarter of 1993 and the same period of 1992 
constituted a total of 79.4 percent, for the year as a whole the 
volume of industrial production as compared with the 1992 level 
came to 88.3 percent. And in such branches as energy 
machine-building, the garment industry, and the butter and 
cheese, dairy, and printing industries, the volumes of 
production even surpassed the 1992 indicators. 
  The production slump in agriculture last year was lower than 
in industry, and came to only 8 percent. For a long time people 
have tried to convince us of the farmers' inability to feed us 
in the next few years, but the 1993 indicators say just the 
opposite: more than half (52 percent) of the volume of the gross 
output of agriculture was produced on the population's personal 
farms and peasant (individual-farmer) farms. As of 1 January 
1994 the number of the latter in the oblast was 3183. They had 
use of 165,800 hectares of land. 
  Economic difficulties had a considerably stronger effect in 
capital construction. In 1993 the volumes of capital investments 
at the expense of all sources of financing dropped by 33 percent 
and come to 1188 billion rubles, which is the consequence of the 
reduction during the past two years of the investment activity 
rate of the enterprises. The rates of the slump in the volumes 
of capital investments in agriculture (by 53 percent) are 
considerably higher than in the other branches. Capital 
investments in the nonproduction sphere decreased by 2 percent 
and came to 43.9 billion rubles. However, the share of funds for 
housing and social-cultural construction in the overall volume 
of capital investments rose from 35 percent in 1992 to 37 
percent in 1993. 
  As of 1 January 1994, 1375 enterprises in the oblast were 
privatized, of which 439, or 3 percent, were privatized in 1993. 
The share of the privatized large-scale enterprises that are 
federal property increased from 5 percent in 1992 to 11 percent 
in 1993. The number of enterprises that were oblast and 
municipal property dropped somewhat, respectively from 18 to 14 
percent and from 76 to 75 percent. On the average, the value of 
one privatized enterprise that is municipal property was 2.7 
million rubles; oblast property, 39.6 million; and federal 
property, 88.4 million rubles. The total proceeds from the sale 
of property to new owners (including the funds accruing from 
enterprises that had been privatized in 1992) came to 5.7 
billion rubles of monetary funds and 526,300 privatization 
checks. More than 60 percent of the funds received from the 
privatization of enterprise property became part of the income 
of the oblast budget and the rayon and city budgets. 
  As of 1 January 1994, 82,300 apartments (30.6 percent of the 
total number), including 37,500 in 1993, were privatized. 
  The demographic situation in the oblast remains strained. In 
1993, 9600 persons were born in Smolensk Oblast. That is 1200 
(11 percent) less than in 1992. The number of persons who died 
was 19,200, or 2900 (17.6 percent) more.

<F P=106> [Article, under rubric "Statistics": "How Are We Living?" </F>
  [Text] SMOLENSKIYE NOVOSTI recently published a statistical 
survey of the oblast's socioeconomic situation in 1993. But how 
did the city of Smolensk live through that year? Specialists 
will have to carry out a professional analysis of the situation. 
We shall present only the most interesting data from a report 
that was prepared by the city's statistics department. 
  Last year 2469 infants were born in Smolensk. This is 525 
(17.5 percent) less than in 1992. During the same year 4550 
persons departed for the other world (732, or 19.2 percent, more 
than in 1992). It is not difficult to compute that, as a result 
of the considerable increase in the mortality rate, as compared 
with the birth rate, the natural loss in the population was 
2081, or an increase in that indicator by a factor of 2.5 as 
compared with 1992). Incidentally, the year 1992 in this respect 
outstripped the year 1991 to an even greater extent -- by a 
factor of 20.5. 
  The average income of persons working in the city's 
enterprises and organizations last December was 101,000 rubles, 
including 87,900 rubles of wages. The persons with the highest 
wages were construction workers. Their average December wages 
were 134,700 rubles. For those workers also, last year the wages 
rose more rapidly than anyone else's (by a factor of 11.2, as 
compared with 1992). Then come the organizations in the 
nonproduction sphere -- 96,800 rubles (10.9); motor 
transportation -- 96,000 rubles (7.4); industry -- 78.1 (6); 
trade and public nutrition -- 71,200 ((.2); housing and 
municipal economy -- 65,000 rubles (8.7); and personal services 
-- 57,200 (8.7). 
  The year 1993 also presented Smolensk with 2586 new 
families, 
which is 1266 (6.8 percent) more than in 1992. However, 1981 
divorces were registered that year. Thus, for each 100 
marriages, there are 77 divorces... 
  Last year the city's enterprises produced consumer goods 
with 
a total value of 310 billion rubles, or 10.5 percent (in 
comparable prices) less than in 1992. In light industry the 
situation is worse -- the production of commodities dropped by 
12.8 percent. The amount of food products produced was 2.1 
percent less than in 1992, including: meat (8.9 percent); 
whole-milk output (0.8); bread and rolls (8.8); confectionery 
articles (7.6); and soft drinks (20.9). But the amount of 
sausage products produced increased by more than 0.2 percent. 
There was also a 0.9 percent increase in the production of 
alcoholic beverages. 
  A total of 1692 apartments, or 80.1 percent more than the 
1992 level, were activated in 1993 at the expense of all sources 
of financing. In the total amount of housing, state builders 
turned over 30 percent, and the remaining 70 percent was the 
share of the nonstate sector. In addition, last year ten 
uncompleted construction projects, with a total value of 58.8 
million rubles, were sold at open auctions. 
  According to the results of the first 11 months of 1993, 3 
percent of the city's industrial enterprises were operating at a 
loss; 14.3 percent of transportation enterprises; 11.4 percent 
of construction enterprises; 22.2 percent of trade enterprises; 
36.4 percent of personal-services enterprises; and 8.3 percent 
of scientific organizations. 
  As of 1 January 1994 the indebtedness of customers to the 
city's enterprises and organizations surpassed the indebtedness 
to suppliers and contractors by 22.3 billion rubles, and came to 
a total of 90.9 billion rubles. In the total amount of the 
customers' indebtedness, nonpayments (overdue indebtedness) came 
to 13.3 percent, and the volume of nonpayments to suppliers, 
with regard to the volume of output produced, in December 1993 
came to 20 percent. 
  Overdue indebtedness on wages as of January 1994 came to 
339.1 million rubles in industry and construction. Nevertheless, 
retail commodity turnover increased somewhat. From the official 
registered trade and public-nutrition enterprises alone, the 
population purchased commodities with a total value, in 
comparable prices, that was 4.3 percent more than in 1992. 
However, the volume of sales of personal services dropped (also 
in comparable prices) by 35.5 percent. 
  In 1993, 135 enterprises of municipal property were 
privatized in Smolensk. The average rate of the value of the 
enterprises sold (the ratio of the selling price to the initial 
price) came to a factor of 69. Property funds received 33,500 
privatization checks. The total proceeds from the sale of 
enterprises was 1,922,400,000 rubles. Eleven thousand apartments 
were also privatized. The rates of privatization of housing 
increased by 42 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Yan Strugach: "Inflation, Petersburg-Style"] </F>
  [Text] If, dear reader, you have been experiencing some 
doubts lately listening to or reading upbeat reports on the 
record low inflation level during past February and the first 
weeks of March, be assured that your inner voice does not lie to 
you. Perhaps somewhere in some cities and villages in Russia 
inflation has indeed slowed down, but in our city it remains as 
high as before. 
  The Center for Economic Situation Assessment under the 
Government of the Russian Federation has calculated the average 
rate of inflation in Russia in February at 9.9 percent. 
Naturally, this figure is like the average temperature in a 
hospital, and naturally, we are more interested in our own 
illness. Well, according to the Petersburg Committee for 
Statistics, the rate of inflation in our city registered 20.2 
percent, the impact of which many compatriots apparently felt on 
their pockets. 
  The problem, of course, is not discrepancy in numbers. The 
map of Russia today is indeed a patchwork, which consists not of 
administrative units but economic regions, which differ from one 
another by inflation index. What is worse is that many 
economists and commentators use this average indicator, which 
does not reflect in any way the trend in inflationary processes, 
as a basis for their conclusions regarding the government's 
course, effectiveness of reforms, political situation, etc. 
  For instance, they associate the aforementioned "record" 9.9 
percent with the fact that Chernomyrdin allegedly has become an 
even greater monetarist than Gaydar and Fedorov, and does not 
give money to anyone, and the Central Bank, too, stopped issuing 
credit. But neither can Petersburg industry boast of any 
monetary "infusions." Interestingly, average wages in February 
also declined as compared to December (by 1 percent in the city 
and 4 percent in the oblast). 
  Another factor that is mentioned frequently is inflationary 
expectations, that is, in anticipation of an imminent jump in 
prices people tend to stockpile some or other goods, which 
causes prices to rise as a result of increased demand. This 
explanation is doubtful, too: Durable goods, which usually are 
the ones purchased ahead, did not go up in price as much in 
February as daily necessities. Nobody can stockpile milk, bread, 
or fish, after all, but these are precisely the items whose 
prices went up by 22-31 percent. 
  The inflation index was also seriously affected by the rise 
in the cost of municipal services (sixfold, due to a 18.9-fold 
increase in water usage rates), consumer services, 
transportation, etc. 
  This means that these price changes did not take place for 
the reasons commentators now describe with hope and elation; 
they happened for other reasons, and not without some doing on 
the part of the leaders of the Russian and local governments. 
Look first and foremost at how wholesale prices have changed in 
industry, because some of them determine the prices for all 
other goods and services and depend above all on government 
decisions. Here we find out that over two months of this year 
wholesale prices in the electric power generation industry, as 
well as in the food processing industry, more than doubled, and 
those in the construction material industry increased by 61 
percent. We also have to keep in mind that over the preceding 
months prices for bakery products were held at a relatively low 
level with the help of subsidies, and now this barrier is gone, 
too. 
  So it turns out that prices (read: inflation) are not 
marriages: they are not made in heaven but in the offices of the 
authorities. Our 20 percent Petersburg inflation in February 
(200 rubles from each R1,000) is the result of a certain 
influence on economic processes in the region--an influence that 
is not exactly correct and timely. 
  Not long ago Chernomyrdin's government used to be accused of 
giving money to all enterprises across the board. Judging by all 
signs, it has now jumped to the other extreme and does not give 
money to anybody, also across the board. The state is the chief 
debtor, and like any debtor, in an attempt to get out of debt it 
puts those close to it in a difficult situation. It shifts 
social and household expenses onto the population's shoulders; 
does not pay industry for the orders it itself placed, so 
enterprises cannot buy raw materials and components, and so fold 
production. 
  The volume of industrial output produced over two months of 
the current year fell by 23.7 percent as compared to the same 
period of last year. This is a catastrophe, or, to be precise, a 
continuation of the catastrophe. It is more significant, of 
course, at defense industry enterprises and in machine building; 
there is no reason to believe, however, that the sectors 
producing consumer goods are flourishing. 
  As I was working on this article, I pulled out at random one 
of the pile of old statistical report books, which also dealt 
with the first two months of the beginning of the year. It 
turned out to be 1987. What were the quantities produced then 
and now of what are called basic necessities? Meat: over the 
first two months of 1987--29,200 tonnes, in 1994--3,700, or 
6,100 if ready-to-cook meats are counted; sausages: 23,300 and 
9,100 tonnes; whole milk products: 184,000 and 31,700 tonnes; 
flour: 157,000 and 81,200 tonnes; cereals: 1,800 and 1,100 
tonnes; and confectionery items--28,700 and 11,000 tonnes. 
  Also characteristic are the figures showing the situation in 
Leningrad Oblast agriculture. Let us not compare volume 
indicators--those may be distorted. But here are those showing 
the level of production as a whole, and its effectiveness: the 
average yield of milk per cow in 1987 amounted to 544 kg, and it 
is now 410; even hens used to lay 40 eggs over two months, and 
now they lay only 37. Add to this an alarming decline in the 
livestock and poultry herd (the herd of horned cattle declined 
from 544,200 head in 1987 to 388,100 in 1994), as well as a drop 
in the population's purchases of piglets and chicks to raise on 
personal plots; add the quantity of machinery at agricultural 
enterprises that has decreased by a factor of 1.5-2.0, and you 
can forecast a meager harvest. 
  I have no intention to paint gloomy pictures of ruin, 
famine, 
and other disasters without having in my possession more 
extensive information and more detailed analysis. Especially 
keeping in mind that the socioeconomic picture is sometimes 
amusing and paradoxical. Along with dark paints when it comes to 
production and inflation, it has rainbow-bright colors that no 
specialist can reasonably explain. The city's consumer market is 
filled with domestic and imported goods; the assortment of a 
score of food products has broadened; and despite rising prices, 
the consumer demand is high and is not declining. 
  The credit for the abundance of goods should go to a large 
extent to new commercial structures, which took upon themselves 
the problem of supplying a huge city. But where does the 
population's money come from, considering that the government 
does not give money to anybody, the average wage is dropping, 
and production is folding? It is unlikely to be 
savings--inflation in tandem with currency reforms would have 
"eaten" them up a long time ago. The only assumption left is 
that in its impoverished state the population has at its 
disposal considerable resources that do not lend themselves to 
counting, estimates, or regulation. 
  This point in such a case becomes a major factor in managing 
the national economy in general and that of Petersburg and 
Leningrad Oblast in particular. Without figuring out and 
understanding this phenomenon, the administrators will never be 
able to offer true anti-inflation measures, organize the budget, 
and revive production. Meanwhile, those in the administrative 
apparatus intuitively sense this strange paradox and gradually, 
but equally tentatively, tighten the screws of price pressure. 
Let us hope that our administrators will sense in time the limit 
for this pressure or will see the true causes of what is 
happening.

<F P=106> [Report by L. Fomicheva and Yu. Trefilov: "A Rayon for </F>
Three"] 
  [Text] The protracted struggle to merge three St. 
Petersburg rayons--Smolninskiy, Dzerzhinskiy, and 
Kuybyshevskiy--is over. At a meeting of rayon activists, which 
took place in the district Officers House yesterday, the city 
mayor introduced the head of administration of the 
new--Central--rayon. The person appointed to this job is 
47-year-old Anatoliy Borisovich Chaus, who until recently was 
head of the Smolninskiy Rayon administration. 
  "In creating the Central Rayon," said A.A. Sobchak, "we are 
bringing it closer to city standards. It will have a population 
of 330,000, which is in line with other rayons. The main point 
of this merger is the communality of interests typical of the 
center of the city. This involves first and foremost the 
restoration and reconstruction of residential housing and 
engineering communications. The rayon's enlargement is also 
dictated by the need to carry out large-scale projects--such as 
the reconstruction of St. Petersburg's historic center, the 
Apraksin Mart, and the creation of a tourist center." 
  There are 44,360 families needing improvement of their 
living 
conditions currently residing in the central part of the city. 
Practically no new housing is being built. If one old quarter 
after another undergoes reconstruction, however, this problem 
may be solved: this way, the refurbished housing stock may be 
increased two- to threefold. 
  Anatoliy Aleksandrovich answered many questions, including 
on 
particular subjects. Regarding the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo Higher 
Navy Engineering School located in the Admiralty building, the 
mayor said that the initiative of moving the school out of it 
comes from the Leningrad Navy Base Commander V. Grishanov. After 
the notorious fire in the Admiralty, he appealed to the Russian 
Ministry of Defense to move the school to Pushkino. 
  City residents asked the mayor about rumors of the imminent 
resignation of GUVD [City Administration of Internal Affairs] 
chief Arkadiy Kramarev. The mayor said that he does not have any 
personal dislike for the major general and considers him a good 
professional and a worthy person. However, in Anatoliy Sobchak's 
opinion, with all his positive qualities, the GUVD chief lacked 
the firmness to remove "old school" staff from the main 
administration's apparat, which affects the work of law 
enforcement organs. 
  One of the mayor's negative comments was that, in selecting 
his cadres, he frequently prefers those who previously worked in 
party structures. 
  "I hear both this sort of accusations, and the opposite. I 
select professionals for their business qualities on the premise 
that they leave all their old beliefs outside the door of their 
new offices and work honestly and conscientiously in the new 
environment."

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Konstantinov] </F>
  [Text] At a briefing for Russian and foreign 
journalists held yesterday in the St. Petersburg and oblast GUVD 
[City Administration of Internal Affairs], militia staff spoke 
about business and private entrepreneurship security 
problems. 
  Sergey Sidorenko, chief of the regional administration for 
combating organized crime, pointed out that when business and 
private entrepreneurship reemerged in Russia in the mid-1980's, 
structures feeding on it began to grow and develop; as a result, 
extortion, debt repayment "enforcement," kidnapping, and 
contract murders have become ordinary events. 
  Sergey Sidorenko noted that currently only state law 
enforcement organs can realistically help entrepreneurs. 
According to the data he quoted, of 120 private security 
companies registered in Petersburg, about 40 live by openly 
criminal notions. Organized crime structures also are attempting 
to penetrate banks with the purpose of using them for their 
needs. Sergey Sidorenko told the journalists the names of four 
Petersburg banks in which, in his opinion, the possibility of 
the presence of organized crime structures is absolutely 
precluded. They are: Promstroybank [State Bank for Industrial 
Development], Sberbank [State Savings Bank], Sankt Peterburg 
bank, and Petrovskiy bank. 
  Foreign entrepreneurs also encounter Russian bandits in 
Petersburg. About 20 percent of all joint companies and Western 
enterprises actively cooperate with our mafia. For instance, 
some Finnish enterprises pay bandits 100,000 Finnish markka a 
month. The only advice he could give to entrepreneurs in the 
current situation is not to be afraid to turn to law enforcement 
organs for help, because even setting up their own security 
services does not solve the problem for businessmen and 
entrepreneurs. Only the militia can realistically help them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Elections: Who Made It to the Second </F>
Round?"] 
  [Text] At a press conference in the Mariinskiy Palace 
yesterday, City Electoral Commission Chairman V.I. Fomichev 
announced the preliminary results of the elections to the St. 
Petersburg City Assembly. 
  Of the 3.8 million eligible voters in the city, 932,000, or 
25.6 percent, turned out at election precincts on 20 and 21 
March. 
  The commission currently counts the elections as valid in 25 
electoral districts in the city. It is possible that after the 
final vote count this number will rise to 26. And here is the 
rating of electoral coalitions. According to preliminary data, 
the right to participate in the second round was won by 19 
candidates from Democratic Unity of Petersburg, six candidates 
from the All Petersburg bloc, five from The City We Love, two 
from the Our City--Our Home bloc, one from Unity for Progress, 
and 16 independent candidates. 
  Vladimir Fomichev reported that the city commission is 
currently looking into numerous complaints and comments from 
various election precincts. There are questions regarding the 
integrity of ballot boxes during the night of 20-21 March. 
  An unusual situation happened in the 22nd Electoral 
District, 
where Lev Karlin from the Democratic Unity of Petersburg and 
independent candidate Vadim Zhimirov qualified for the second 
round. District voters [line(s) missing] in the city. There was 
not enough for everyone, though, and so complaints flowed in 
both from ordinary voters and electoral coalitions. Many 
consider this charitable act a violation of the Statute on 
Elections, since this way propaganda for candidate Zhimirov was 
conducted on election day. Because even price tags with 
unbelievably low prices said in large letters: "Almaz." 
  Well, what about out-of-town students and fixed-term 
military 
servicemen, permitted to vote by the mayor's decision of 21 were 
they included on voter lists? To this question Vladimir Fomichev 
provided a rather vague explanation. It turns out that the main 
voter registration list is put together 30 days before the 
elections. As to the supplemental lists, where the new category 
of voters were written in, they were put together at the 
precincts as out-of-town students and military servicemen showed 
up. The commission does not know the total number of such 
persons in the city. Their inclusion on the lists of registered 
voters, however, could substantially change the picture of 
population turnout at electoral precincts. This situation will 
certainly come up more than once as a subject of various 
inquiries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Provinces": "Scandal </F>
in Nizhniy Novgorod"] 
  [Text] In one of the largest regions--Nizhniy 
Novgorod--free expression of citizens' will seems to have been 
overshadowed by a scandal. Those involved in it are not ordinary 
candidates: They are D. Bednyakov, acting mayor of Nizhniy 
Novgorod; Ye. Krestyaninov, a senator and former oblast soviet 
chairman; and indirectly--Governor B. Nemtsov. 
  The scandal began to flare up when D. Bednyakov 
and Ye. Krestyaninov both decided to run for city 
mayor. The governor supported the latter. Apparently for this 
reason the rivals accused them both of corruption and 
connections with the mafia. Apparently not wishing to 
participate in a slugfest, Ye. Krestyaninov removed himself from 
the mayoral race, and the elections did not take place 
altogether. 
  D. Bednyakov, however, also was running for the oblast Duma. 
Elections in his Electoral District No. 3 were declared invalid, 
however, since fewer than 25 percent of valid ballots had been 
cast. Later, in clear violation of procedure, a recount was 
conducted and... found a sufficient number of votes. The initial 
data were destroyed. The procuracy began an investigation. This 
actually was the high point of the scandal. 
  It was preceded by another, however--abuses that occurred 
during the privatization of GAZ [Gorkiy Auto Works], the largest 
Russian automotive giant. The plant leadership was accused of 
illegally buying up vouchers for subsequent privatization. 
Governor B. Nemtsov, among others, brought up the subject of the 
illegality of such operations. 
  Whether by accident or not, after this incident allegations 
of corruption began to fly with respect to both the governor and 
his confederates. At the same time, the GAZ leadership openly 
supports acting Mayor D. Bednyakov. So far, however, the 
fight for influence in the oblast has been contained in the 
boundaries of election-related scandals.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Arifdzhanov under the rubric "Provincial </F>
Life": "The Reforms As a Sight To See in Nizhniy Novgorod: 
Chernomyrdin, Chubays, and Zaveryukha Flew to Nizhniy To Witness 
the Local Experiments"] 
  [Text] Three weeks before the Russian leaders arrived here, 
British Prime Minister John Major walked along the former 
Sverdlov Street, which is now Bolshaya Pokrovka, drank some 
champagne in the Heraldic Hall of the restored building of the 
Nizhniy Novgorod trade fair, and admired the reforms. 
  What is happening in the old and glorious Volga city, why 
are 
the inquisitive and the curious flying here from all nearby 
krays and oblasts and from distant countries across the ocean 
(they have even begun to publish a local newspaper in English, 
NIZHNIY NOVGOROD TIMES--so what, there is a demand)? 
<H5>  Nemtsov, the Governor </H5>
  It is clear to everyone that the reforms came from Nemtsov. 
A 
senior scientific associate at Gorkiy Scientific Research 
Institute, the radiophysics techie occupied a main Nizhniy 
Novgorod office on the wave of the antinuclear rally movement. 
  In August 1991 a remarkable photograph was published 
throughout the world press--next to the favorite of the Russians 
and our first president was a tall person with white teeth 
wearing the most fashionable long coat and a no less fashionable 
scarf. 
  They said that it was he, Nemtsov, who had come on Yeltsin's 
behalf to reach an agreement with the Taman Division concerning 
support, and they did agree. The Taman members turned away from 
the supporters of the State Committee for the State of 
Emergency. Thus Nemtsov became Yeltsin's local representative in 
Nizhniy Novgorod and then at the same time head of the 
administration, and the session of the oblast council decreed 
that he be called governor from then on. 
  Nemtsov passed the test of power. Moreover, in the opinion 
of 
the majority of people who know him, he grew into a serious 
politician far above the local level. Three important things 
took place with him. He did not stagnate, he did not cease to be 
the people's favorite, and he did not dress himself in the armor 
of a highly placed boss surrounded by a retinue of yes men (in 
Rus', alas, there have always been as many examples of this as 
you may wish). That is the first thing. 
  He did not become the mouthpiece, the arm, the eye, and 
everything else of the Moscow leaders, afraid of his own opinion 
and his own obstinacy. And, third, he is constantly growing, 
seeking, and he is not afraid of trying things. 
  I will not say that among the Russian governors, provincial 
presidents, and members of the Council of the Federation, Boris 
Nemtsov is the most respected. But that he is the most noticed 
and, perhaps, the most energetic--there is no doubt. 
<H5>  Yavlinskiy, the Reformer </H5>
  People speak about the great friendship between Boris 
Nemtsov 
and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, which goes back almost to before they 
can remember. This is hardly true. The distance between the 
deputy chairman of the Silayev Council of Ministers and the 
young Nizhniy Novgorod deputy was fairly significant in those 
days. But they felt a sympathy for one another. They even look a 
little bit alike, not to mention the similarity of their manner 
of thinking, communicating, and making decisions. 
  Therefore it was no accident when Yavlinskiy's ideas were 
not 
called for after the first visit of Gaydar and his team of 
"Chicago boys" that the theretofore fashionable economist with a 
group of his own "boys" from the "EPItsentr" which he organized 
set out for Nizhniy Novgorod. "Capitalism with a Yavlinskiy 
face" was constructed in Nizhniy in a year and a half and the 
program called "Nizhniy Novgorod EPIlog" was implemented. 
  The experiment in small-scale and medium-scale privatization 
in the Nizhniy Novgorod area was deemed most successful. The 
privatization of the trucks was especially successful. At the 
time when the State Automotive Inspection had not introduced the 
new Russian numbers and it was possible to tell from the 
combination of numbers and letters who owned the motor 
vehicle--a private party or the state--and the travelers along 
the local roads were struck by the abundance of "private" 
numbers on the trucks. 
  And here, unlike other Russian oblasts, they rejected the 
coupon system for distribution of products. The prices were 
liberalized. They turned out to be higher than their neighbors' 
and the "product delivery line" was spontaneous, changing 
according to the laws of the market, turned in the direction of 
Nizhniy. But at the same time in the oblast wages remained about 
10-15 percent higher than their neighbors'. The neighbors 
complained, groaned about "local prejudice" and "selfishness," 
but because of this Nizhniy lived better than the others. 
  There were mistakes as well. For instance, they decided to 
introduce something like their own money--this was when Russia 
was gripped by the "cash" crisis, to which the Gaydar government 
proceeded deliberately, trying thus to control the operation of 
the printing press. The oblast money, which even before it 
appeared was christened "Yavlinki," fortunately, was not needed. 
They did without it. 
  Attracted by Yavlinskiy's name, foreign specialists were 
also 
drawn to the city, first simply to look, and then to help. 
<H5>  Anthony Doran, `Missionary' </H5>
  All right, Yavlinskiy did not go very far when he left 
Moscow. Specialists came here from America and England to help 
"push" the reforms. Anthony Doran, a specialist from the 
International Financial Corporation, lived in the Volga city for 
almost a year. He had a whole group of advisers along with him. 
  Practically free of charge, which Russian Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin emphasized, and sometimes, to be honest, at their 
own expense, the Englishmen and Americans helped to privatize 
the sovkhozes and kolkhozes in the remote Nizhniy Novgorod area. 
  You might say that things were not going very well in 
Russia. 
Yes, the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes were transformed into 
joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships, and 
farmers appeared in some places. But so what? The farmers were 
moaning and groaning and even intending to leave. The 
joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships were 
new in name only--they used the former methods and the results 
were lamentable. 
  And here another good friend of Chernomyrdin (apparently for 
this reason), the country's chief agrarian, Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, almost caused the relations that had developed in 
rural areas to break down prematurely. It was a matter of acting 
without thinking. The Russian individual is special, and our 
path is special. So just give us more credit for the branch and 
we will respond with a harvest. The credit was given. This kept 
Zaveryukha quiet for a time. Then they asked for some more. They 
did not give him enough, and so the harvest did not turn out. 
  Chernomyrdin took Zaveryukha along with him to Nizhniy 
Novgorod. But he also took the minister of agriculture, Viktor 
Khlystun, a person who was undoubtedly more progressive. 
  What did the "missionary"--and you could not call him 
anything else--Anthony Doran, show them? 
  In the village of Kovrigno the Kolkhoz imeni 60-Letiye 
Oktyabrya was coming off the auction block. The auction was 
conducted according to a plan developed by Doran and his men. 
  First they divided all the kolkhoz land and all the property 
together into actual land and property shares. Everyone living 
on the kolkhoz received equal rights to shares of land. 
Depending on their work tenure and wages, each one received a 
property share as well. And the old pensioners became almost the 
richest ones when things were divided up--they had been working 
there for decades. 
  Then they began to combine the shares. Anyone who wanted to 
work as an individual--who was tired of cooking in the common 
pot--he kept his share. Anyone who was thinking about a 
farmer-run or peasant farm, joined together with relatives or 
close friends. 
  The rest of the people were divided into three groups. They 
turned their shares over for leasing or to the former chairman, 
or to the chief agronomist and economist. It was possible to 
reach an agreement on money as well, but the villagers preferred 
payment in kind--wood for a year, milk every week, a worthy 
burial. That was also possible. 
  This was not the first privatization according to the new 
plan in the oblast. One kolkhoz and one sovkhoz had been 
transformed this way before that. And if in Kovrigno there was 
not a single person who would sell his share forever, in other 
villages there were also "seasonal workers." They were tired of 
being tied to the land. One old lady sold here certificates 
(they were given to everyone) for so many cases of vodka. That 
was her right. 
<H5>  Makarycheva, the Chairman </H5>
  Eight potential buyers came to trade at the auction, which 
was attended not only by the government, but also by 37 
governors and administration chiefs from regions of Russia. 
There were two private property owners. Two farmers. Three 
future leaders of mixed companies (those same chairmen, 
agronomists, and economists) and the chief specialist of a 
former kolkhoz who was thinking about creating the limited 
liability partnership Tekhservis. The land was divided up 
peacefully and, from all indications, long before the auction 
itself took place. 
  But at the property auction they were pounding the gavel 
constantly. They were vying, as it were, for each tractor and 
each truck. There was bidding for the cow barn, the sheep farm, 
the cows, and the sheep. Whoever offered more, whoever was more 
resolute, whoever had calculated more precisely the package of 
property shares. 
  The economist Yekaterina Nikolayevna Makarycheva, now 
chairman of the mixed partnership Moshkinskoye, left the auction 
satisfied. She did not manage to buy everything she wanted; 
there were not enough warm garages for agricultural equipment, 
but, all right, it was possible to reach an agreement to pay for 
their use. 
  But Chernomyrdin was perhaps even more satisfied with the 
auction than Makarycheva was. Thus he said, looking the 
representatives of the other components of the Federation in the 
eyes: "We shall use the Nizhniy Novgorod experiment as a basis 
for a Russia-wide national program for privatization in rural 
areas." 
<H5>  Yefremov, the Economist </H5>
  Big-time politics had turned Yavlinskiy's head. He left 
Nizhniy Novgorod. Some of his team also took deputy seats in the 
State Duma. 
  The reforms in Nizhniy Novgorod were now in the hands of the 
deputy leader of the oblast department of economics and 
prognostication, Vladimir Yefremov. The boy from Vyatka (the 
neighboring oblast), he received his professorial robes in the 
American city of Springfield. Yefremov links his views on the 
reforms and their success primarily to the rise of industry. 
  They had already determined their priorities for the 
development of the oblast economy. They "went" to the government 
with a proposal to grant the oblast "defense industry" an 
investment tax credit for payments into the federal budget, they 
developed a system of bills of exchange for Ministry of Defense 
debts to the enterprises, and they are beginning to create a 
fund for supporting the enterprises on the basis of commercial 
banks for financing the development of production in keeping 
with the established priorities. And there are many more 
proposals. The oblast administration has already adopted decrees 
regarding all of them. 
  Chernomyrdin read it, shook his head--interesting!--and 
suggested: Get together with Shokhin and Soskovets and think 
about what can be used at the federal level. 
  After the departure of the Moscow guests, the telephone in 
the office of affairs of the oblast administration started 
ringing off the hook with long distance calls: We are coming to 
see what interesting things you have there.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Simonov, NOVOSTI RUSSIAN PRESS AGENCY </F>
political observer, especially for LITERATURNAYA GAZETA: 
"Stiffening of the Spine: Russia in Search of Equal Partnership 
With the United States"] 
  [Text] Life is zigzag-like--including, international 
life. 
  We had just been touched to find, it seems, that we 
were "in the thick of a joint Russian-American revolution." And 
we have suddenly, at a rush, torn into another thicket--rows, 
suspicions, and rivalry which have simultaneously disturbed the 
seemingly unruffled harmony of Russia's relations with the 
United States. 
<H5>  Nerves, Nerves </H5>
  Espionage. Nixon, poor soul. Bosnia. This is just a 
telegraphic list of the sharp elbows which the two countries 
have suddenly dug into one another's sides, compelling the 
impressionable press to speak of "the most serious crisis of 
recent years," "return of the Cold War," and the "old bared 
teeth of the Russian bear." 
  Enough. It is a question of a bad state of nerves. The quite 
banal incidents pertain to a period when very serious 
complications of a domestic nature have arisen for the two 
presidents. 
  Once again betrayed by his inner circle and exposed by the 
procurator general, Yeltsin has been forced to seek ways of 
neutralizing the consequences of the amnesty. Wresting away the 
initiative, having thrown his authority and energy into 
realization of the idea of civil reconciliation, is seen to be 
one of them. A strong, well-considered move. The last thing the 
occupant of the Kremlin needs at this time is the elderly 
patriarch of American politics walking past him with a trembling 
hand proferred to his enemy. 
  Nerves crack. 
  Clinton is not in the best position. Three of his 
associates, 
including the defense secretary, have returned to private life. 
The Whitewater mire--the turbid affair of the Clintons' real 
estate in Arkansas, in which all kinds of malfeasance are being 
attributed to them--is yawning ever wider and dragging on. 
  Finally, the latest blow. Webster Hubbel, No. 3 in the 
Justice Department and the president's constant companion on the 
golf course, has resigned. He is accused of over billing as a 
lawyer at the Rose Law Firm in the 1980's. And Hillary Clinton 
ranked as Hubble's partner in this firm. Having one of the 
snuggest offices of the CIA occupied by a paid agent of the 
Soviets, excuse me, Russian democrats, was just about the last 
straw. Nerves give out also. 
  In addition, both presidents are being enveloped, as it 
were, 
by a spectral, in some respects Kafkaesque, picture of what is 
happening on the other side of the ocean. 
  Here is Yeltsin, reading a dispatch from the Russian Embassy 
in Washington. Knowing the sentiments of our ambassador, it may 
be assumed that the president is being warned about the passive, 
reactive, short-sighted policy of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs in respect to the United States, which suffers, what is 
more, from infantile pro-Americanism. 
  Time for consultations with the minister of foreign affairs. 
The latter explains persuasively to the president that if 
infantile pro-Americanism does in fact show through anywhere, it 
is only in the incapacity of our embassy in Washington to 
establish professional, forceful diplomatic work. In addition, 
the boss of Smolenskaya Square believes, this ailment is 
suffered by our members of parliament, who have become regular 
visitors to the United States. Their pilgrimage should be halted. 
  Yeltsin is puzzled. Such scissors in the evaluations, 
beneath 
the blade of which the broader spectrum of Russian-American 
relations evidently falls, are of hardly any help to him. 
  Clinton is wandering in a similar information fog also. 
Voices from Congress, some of his advisers, and the news media 
are forcefully explaining to him that since the December 
elections Yeltsin has become a captive of the national-patriotic 
forces. With the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov not a single 
reformer remains in the government. Nor have their numbers 
increased in parliament. The reforms are dead. The tune in this 
unfortunate country is being called by the new demon of Russian 
politics--Zhirinovskiy. 
<H5>  Horse and Rider </H5>
  However odd, the leader of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party 
of Russia] is now growing in the American mass consciousness 
into something gigantic, almost other-worldly, like King Kong, 
who catches airplanes in his paws, seated atop a skyscraper. Of 
course, the frightening image of the politician is being 
inflated not by himself, but by other people. Let us try and 
understand this passage from THE NEW YORK POST: 
  "The amnesty and the subsequent release of the rebel leaders 
were a personal victory for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (my 
emphasis--V.S.), who found opportunities for this in the new 
constitution, prepared the draft resolution, persuaded a 
substantial majority of the members of parliament to support it, 
and won the putschists' release...." 
  All was mixed and baked by him personally. The absolute 
arbiter of Russia's fate. It is hard to believe that the author 
of this piece was Jeane Kirkpatrick, former representative of 
the United States at the United Nations and professor at 
Georgetown University, so simplistically does she conceive of 
the battering-ram that broke through the gate of Lefortovo. Such 
panegyrics to the leader of the LDPR, which can be seen in 
American newspapers from time to time, are needed to prove the 
proposition that Zhirinovskiy's ideas have become Russia's 
official foreign policy. 
  Consequently, the Clinton administration should have done 
with its infatuation with Yeltsin and his reforming. 
Consequently, a cordon sanitaire around the enemy, which is 
coming round from its coma, needs to be created out of the 
former Soviet republics. And, of course, it is necessary to stop 
shaking loose from Congress money for Russian espionage and 
other imperialism which is a threat to the creditors themselves. 
  The driving forces of this campaign are the hard-line 
Republican opposition, the military-industrial complex, and 
sundry people profiting from enmity with Moscow. We, of course, 
are free to believe that this is a mildewed invention of the 
international affairs specialists of the times of Yuriy Zhukov. 
  We could also give ourselves over to the illusion, to which 
the U.S. Administration also has given itself over in recent 
years, that the fall of communism is sweeping away the main 
barrier between the two countries, removing in this way all the 
reasons for confrontation. What is there to divide the two 
democracies? Values common to all mankind have always and in all 
things been higher than national interests, which are losing 
their distinctiveness and becoming increasingly coincident. Is 
this not so? 
  Whence, it is true, Washington concluded that it is Russia 
which should act as the domestic servant of the national 
interests of the United States. Those vanquished in the Cold War 
should pay tribute to the victor. 
  Mixed in with this is the traditional American missionary 
disposition--the passion to serve up to the world its experience 
as the fruit of the highest wisdom, be it the Chicago monetarist 
school in economic affairs or high-handed leadership in all that 
concerns foreign policy. 
  Then the dominoes began to fall. The December elections. The 
departure of Gaydar and Fedorov. Yeltsin's report to the Federal 
Assembly, which emphasized a tougher foreign policy more 
oriented toward national interests. Our diplomatic breakthrough 
in Bosnia. Russia's irritating, vigorous efforts in the Near 
East.... 
  Had the U.S. Administration not measured Russia's reforms by 
Chicago yardsticks and had it not reveled in its patronage over 
the "rubble of the USSR," these changes would have come as no 
shock to it. And would not be taken by some Western politicians 
as the end of the world. Washington would then be paying closer 
heed to the opinion of its own people who have observed events 
up close. For example, Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to 
Moscow. He maintains: 
  "Reforms in a country spanning 11 time zones are not 
dependent on the will of individuals. Crudely put, had there 
been no Gaydar or Fedorov, today's Russia would be attempting to 
take its leave of the legacy of the Soviet past, which is 
discrediting it, just as actively and in roughly the same spirit 
as now. This truth is applicable even to Boris Yeltsin, although 
he has already made an enormous contribution to this work and 
will, I hope, make no less important a contribution in the 
future." 
<H5>  Wedge in Another's Field </H5>
  In his speech at the Council for International Relations, 
from where this quotation was taken, Pickering overlooks one 
important factor. It was Washington's high-handed attitude 
toward Russia and its impudence and, as a result, the abasement 
of Russians' national pride which brought the ultra-nationalist 
scum to the surface of political life. If some people in the 
United States are today demonizing Zhirinovskiy, for truth's 
sake brief mention should be made somewhere in parentheses of 
their direct involvement in this phenomenon. 
  Whatever, it is finally clear that the failure of communism 
has not done away with the main contradiction between Russia and 
the United States--their natural rivalry over the possession of 
raw material, world markets, and security guarantees. And over 
the right to consider certain regions--I quote from Yeltsin's 
report to the Federal Assembly--"a sphere of the special 
responsibility and special mutual interests of Russia and its 
neighbors." 
  The territory of the former republics of the USSR, say. 
Washington's approach to this painful problem, meanwhile, is 
clearly illustrated by its attempts to substitute power 
maneuvers for partnership in a manifestly alien geopolitical 
field. 
  As we know, the CIS heads of state have now become frequent 
visitors to the United States, as formerly princes to the khans 
of the Golden Horde, with complaints about one another. There is 
a slight nuance, it is true: Our ancestors took tribute, their 
descendants seek alms. What is more, often in the most servile 
form. Taking advantage of this, the United States is stipulating 
a new role for itself in the post-Soviet space, clearly 
attempting to carve a wedge in the traditional relations. The 
latest example is the idea that surfaced at Clinton's meeting 
with Shevardnadze--deploying American troops as part of a UN 
force throughout Abkhazia.... What is most astounding--along the 
border with Russia also! 
  The U.S. secretary of state, meanwhile, delivers to the 
Russian president, who stated Moscow's readiness for 
peacekeeping operations on the territory of CIS, something akin 
to a rebuke. Warren Christopher is sternly insisting on the 
prior approval of international institutions of the CSCE type. 
And it is being made understood, what is more, that obtaining 
the consent of the United States itself would be the ideal 
option. 
  This is already archaic. Russia is today stiffening its 
spine, arising from the all-too-low bow before its partner. And 
hampering this process is not in the partner's interests. 
Slowly, under strain and with sudden nervous shifts Washington 
is beginning, it would seem, to understand this--or at least 
those who make foreign policy. Following the meeting in 
Vladivostok with Minister Kozyrev, that same Warren Christopher 
deemed it necessary to observe: "I told Andrey: perhaps I am 
senior, but only in terms of age. As for the rest, we are equal 
partners...." 
  Splendid, splendid! Tomorrow I would like to take the first 
sample of this equality.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Sukhov, consul general of Russia in </F>
Strasbourg: "No Fundamental Objections. The Adoption of the New 
Constitution and Free Elections Have Removed Barriers to 
Russia's Acceptance into the Council of Europe"] 
  [Text] On 5 May the Council of Europe--this unique 
organization that guards human rights--will have been in 
existence for 45 years. Today it claims 32 states as members. 
How do things stand with Russia? This was related to a 
correspondent of the Russian News Agency Novosti under the 
European Council, Vladimir Katin, at the request of the editors 
of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by the general consul of Russia in 
Strasbourg, Vladimir Sukhov, who has been charged with the task 
of maintaining regular contacts and promoting the development of 
cooperation with the Council of Europe. 
  Russia submitted an application for admission to the Council 
of Europe in May 1992. Until recently its consideration had been 
postponed under the pretext that Russia had not yet "come up" to 
the standards of the Council of Europe, which revolve around 
principles of democracy, pluralism, and supremacy of the law. 
The adoption of the new Russian Constitution and free democratic 
elections to the Federal Assembly on a multiparty basis, as is 
generally recognized, removed this formal obstacle. 
  At the same time the results of the elections of 12 December 
1993 are disquieting to democratic forces, and the events that 
followed them are generating many questions in the Council of 
Europe regarding maintaining the course toward reforms and the 
prospects for political stabilization within Russia. It seems 
that Strasbourg is still taking a wait-and-see position, 
explaining this by a desire to see the direction in which the 
situation in our country will develop from here on. 
  The process of preparation will take a certain amount of 
time. The decision concerning acceptance into the organization 
is made by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
(PACE) on the basis of the conclusions of a number of its 
commissions concerning whether law and order within the 
candidate country meets the basic principles and criteria of the 
Council of Europe. In turn, this presupposes a large amount of 
work on the part of experts and individuals making reports to 
the PACE in cooperation with the Russians, which can take 
months. I am convinced that all the objective preconditions for 
Russia's full-fledged membership are in place. The process of 
Russia's entry into the Council of Europe will proceed more 
rapidly, the more rapidly we develop healthy tendencies toward a 
shift from domestic political confrontation and struggle for 
power to national accord and creative work to bring the country 
out of its economic and social crisis and construct a solid 
legislative base for a rule-of-law state. And this is necessary 
not so much for the Council of Europe as for Russian society, 
which is weary from uncertainty and the pressures of the 
transition period. Then a fresh wind will dispel the "fog of 
doubts" that has now gathered in the Council of Europe 
concerning Russia. 
  Another point that is of no small significance: A good deal 
will depend on how balanced and convincing we are in 
demonstrating Russia's resolve to become a full-fledged member 
of the Council of Europe. Deputies of the Federal Assembly, who 
have been "especially invited" to join the Russian delegation in 
the PACE, will be called upon to play an appreciable role on 
this plane. The tactic of lodging protests about the 
prolongation of the process of accepting Russia into the Council 
of Europe, which the delegation from the former Supreme Soviet 
became involved in, and attempts to shift domestic disputes to 
the PACE arena produced no advantage for Russia. It is much more 
important and effective for our deputies to engage actively in 
calm and regular work for clarifying to their PACE colleagues in 
a well argued way the difficulties and regular processes taking 
place in Russia as well as the priorities of the Russian foreign 
policy, including satisfying its indisputable national interests. 
  As far as I know, practically nobody in the Council of 
Europe 
has any fundamental objections to Russia's entry into the 
organization. Differences of opinion pertain to specific time 
periods for admission having to do with the factors mentioned 
above. 
  It should be kept in mind that our full-fledged membership 
is 
in the interests not only of Russia but also of the Council of 
Europe. The latter has now set for itself the task of becoming 
an all-European organization capable of joining the West and the 
posttotalitarian East of the continent into a unified whole. It 
would hardly be feasible to undertake such a large-scale task 
without Russia's participation. 
  Acceptance into the Council of Europe will have great 
symbolic significance for Russia since this way it will be 
recognized by the international community as a state that has 
made an irrevocable choice in favor of democracy and respect for 
human rights. 
  On the practical plane Russia, which has already been 
cooperating dynamically with the Council of Europe in recent 
years, will not only gain broad access to rich developments and 
programs for organization in the area of human rights, the 
legal, humanitarian, and socioeconomic areas, culture, 
education, information, and ecology, but will also be able to 
participate effectively in the formation of European policy in 
these areas. For example, the Council of Europe is now 
developing a document intended to protect the rights of ethnic 
minorities. The question is extremely crucial for Russia from 
the standpoint of protecting the interests of the 
Russian-speaking population in nearby foreign countries. The 
experience of the Council of Europe and its expert potential 
will help us to improve Russian legislation, reform the judicial 
and penitentiary systems, etc. 
  Membership in the Council of Europe places certain 
obligations on us as well, which will encourage the activity of 
Russian legislators to lay a foundation for a rule-of-law state.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zagorskiy, vice rector of the Moscow </F>
State Institute for International Relations: "Tilting From the 
CSCE to NATO? European Affairs Call for Closer Attention"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  After the Cold War </H5>
  The October events in Moscow would seem to have cleared the 
decks for a more flexible and active Russian policy in Europe. 
After all, it was the dissolved Supreme Soviet that did quite a 
lot to block a rapprochement between Russia and the West. We 
will know the position of the new Russian parliament after the 
coming elections. At the moment there is strong evidence that 
European developments are gradually restricting Russian 
diplomacy's room for manoeuvre. 
  Not long ago people in Europe, which had entered a period of 
sweeping change, were under the impression that a painless end 
of the division of the continent was in the offing. Democratic 
revolutions had created an atmosphere of expectation of early 
European unity. The East and the West stopped looking on each 
other as adversaries, both sides extending a hand of friendship, 
as the Declaration of 22 signed by WTO and NATO countries in 
Paris on November 19, 1990, put it. 
  But over optimistic expectations gradually gave way to some 
realistic thinking. The Yugoslav crisis and the disintegration 
of the country accompanied by armed clashes and civil wars, a 
phenomenon which Europe had forgotten about, and the breakup of 
the Soviet Union, which extended the area of conflict, dampened 
the idyllic mood of architects of a new Europe, making them 
ponder on how to stop Europe's incipient return to the era of 
internecine wars, to Hobbes's "war of all against all". As a 
result, Europe remained virtually divided, except that what we 
have this time is not military and political alignments but an 
economically and socially backward "Eastern periphery" and a 
West that is ahead of it on many counts. 
  In spite of a process of transformation of relations in 
Europe, the equation of the new continental architecture still 
included many unknowns, making its assumption of a reasonably 
marked character difficult. The formation of a pluralist Europe 
relying on a whole set of organisations rather that an only 
organisation is a product of the concept of mutually reinforcing 
institutions. In line with a kind of division of labour, it was 
expected to bring in the CSCE, NATO, North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council (NACC), EC, Western European Union (WEU), Council of 
Europe. But it was not easy for these organisations (except the 
NACC, they all came into being in Cold War years) to find a new 
identity after the end of that war. There even developed a 
certain competition between them. 
  While the United States gave preference to preserving NATO's 
role or searching for a new one, France focussed on extending 
the powers of the EC in the area of security policy, stressing 
the need to revive the WEU. Paris also saw a priority in 
strengthening the CSCE, not NATO, as an instrument of European 
security policy, with the North Atlantic alliance playing only 
an auxiliary role, it is probably safe to say that the 
controversy over which of the European organisations was 
particularly important took as much time as the search for 
solutions to the thorny problems encountered by Europe of late. 
<H5>  The CSCE: A Prospect for the Whole of Europe? </H5>
  Today the CSCE is the only European institution which 
includes Russia as a full-fledged member. This explains Moscow's 
effort to help the CSCE and its institutions play a bigger role 
in European politics. Unlike other ex-Soviet republics, Russia 
did not have to go though any special procedure of admission to 
the Conference, for as a state continuing the Soviet Union, it 
had also inherited the latter's seat in that forum. 
  The mechanisms of the Helsinki process have undergone 
visible 
changes in recent years. Under the 1990 Charter of Paris for a 
New Europe, new bodies have been set up: the CSCE Council 
composed of the members' Foreign Ministers, the Committee of 
Senior Officials (CSO), the Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) in 
Vienna, the Office for Free Elections in Warsaw (now called the 
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) and the 
Secretariat in Prague. Ever since 1992, annual meetings have 
been held by the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly. 
  The first meeting of the CSCE Council (Berlin, June 1991) 
approved a Mechanism for Consultations and Cooperation with 
Regard to Emergency Situations, which makes it possible to call 
extraordinary meetings of the CSO to this end without waiting 
for the go-ahead of all member states. Immediately after that, 
the CSO tackled the crisis in ex-Yugoslavia, and ever since 1992 
it has also been concerned with the conflicts in the ex-Soviet 
Union. 
  The second meeting of the Council (Prague, January 1992) 
admitted the majority of ex-Soviet republics to the CSCE. 
Georgia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina became 
participating states in March and May 1992; Czechia and Slovakia 
have held similar status since their peaceful "divorce" in 1992. 
Currently the CSCE comprises 53 countries. 
  The same Prague meeting resolved to extend the powers of the 
new institutions of the Helsinki process. The CSO became in 
effect the central body of the Conference Council representing 
the latter in between meetings and responsible for coordinating 
the work of other institutions. Established within the framework 
of the CSO was a CSCE Economic Forum, which first met in April 
1993 in Prague. The political functions of the Conflict 
Prevention Centre were extended. The rule demanding that 
decisions be made consensually was partly revised. At present 
decisions can be made according to the formula "consensus minus 
one", at least as far as fulfilling obligations within the 
framework of the human dimension are concerned. 
  Further steps to strengthen CSCE institutions were taken at 
a 
meeting in the Finnish capital that opened on March 24 and 
culminated in a summit on July 9-10, 1992. The 1992 document 
adopted at Helsinki confirmed the key role of the Council and 
extended still further the CSO's power to make decisions. The 
Committee was assigned the chief role in giving early warning of 
emerging conflicts, managing crises, settling disputes by 
peaceful means and carrying out peace-keeping operations. 
  From 1993 on, the CSO has not only met in Prague every month 
but had its working group hold weekly meetings in Vienna that 
have become a standing body, for some of the senior officials 
empowered to represent their countries are stationed in Vienna. 
Also growing in the system of CSCE mechanisms is the role of the 
Acting Chairman -- the Foreign Minister of the country where the 
Council's latest meeting took place. 
  The 1992 Helsinki Document instructed the Warsaw Office for 
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to monitor compliance 
with commitments within the CSCE human dimension, meet to 
discuss this matter, hold specialised seminars and fulfil other 
tasks. In December 1992, the newly established post of CSCE High 
Commissioner for National Minorities was entrusted to former 
Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel. 
  The powers of the CPC, a consultative committee, were 
extended. Specifically, it was authorised to make decisions on 
sending fact-finding missions and rapporteurs to the field with 
a view to detecting potential conflicts at an early date as well 
as to managing crises. Besides, the Centre is to assist the CSO 
in peace-keeping operations. 
  By decision of the CSCE Helsinki meeting (September 1992), a 
CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation has begun functioning in 
Vienna. It is intended to help work out new accords on arms 
control, disarmament and confidence and security building 
(within the framework of the Forum's Special Committee) as well 
as to search for ways and means of settling conflicts (within 
the framework of the Consultative Committee, whose work is 
closely linked with the CPC's tasks). 
  The third meeting of the Council (Stockholm, December 1992) 
established the post of CSCE Secretary-General (in April 1993, 
without waiting for its Rome meeting set for late 1993, it gave 
the post to a German diplomat, Ambassador Wilhelm Hoynck). 
His functions include not only seeing to the proper organisation 
of the work of the secretariats of diverse CSCE structures but 
assisting the Acting Chairman. The Convention on Conciliation 
and Arbitration within the CSCE was signed in Stockholm by 29 
countries. 
  The extended powers and functions of new CSCE structures and 
institutions undoubtedly reflect an effort to react to the 
dramatic events taking place in Europe and help at first sight 
strengthen the trend towards making the CSCE a key component of 
the new European security mechanism. But prudent opinion's 
prevail more and more over the euphoria generated by the early 
steps towards institutionalising the Helsinki process. 
  Initially it looked as if the CSCE could undertake to 
gradually form a community of countries sharing the common 
values of pluralist democracy, human rights, economic freedom 
and social responsibility set out in the Conference's Bonn and 
Copenhagen documents (1990) and in the Charter of Paris. Yet the 
solution of this problem is being put off indefinitely, not to 
say becoming impossible, due above all to the extension of the 
CSCE membership in 1992 and the inclusion in it of all the 
sovereign states established on ex-Soviet territory, 
  Who had expected the CSCE to become a collective 
peace-keeping instrument in Europe were also in for 
disappointment. While the conflicts in ex-Yugoslavia and the CIS 
are the object of intensive CSCE debates, hardly anyone today 
would venture to associate an eventual settlement of these 
conflicts with precisely the CSCE. Nor did the situation change 
with the adoption of the 1992 Helsinki Document, which declared 
the CSCE a regional agency of the UN and provided for eventual 
peace-keeping operations to be funded by NATO, the EC and WEU. 
Nor was solution made any easier by the establishment in June 
1993 of priorities in decision-making on the use of force by the 
international community to maintain peace in Europe, which 
implied that these matters must first be settled at the level of 
the UN Security Council or the CSCE, after which appropriate 
powers can be delegated to NATO or other entities. 
  The very process of decision-making, which presupposes a 
consensus, proved so cumbersome as to make it impossible for the 
CSCE to act promptly and effectively. As for the emerging 
tendency to revise the principle of consensus and make decisions 
by majority vote, it is fraught with a different danger. 
Excluding one of the parties to a conflict from the drafting of 
decisions complicates the implementation of recommendations. 
Ex-Yugoslavia is a case in point. Following the suspension of 
Siberian membership in the CSCE (amounting to that country's de 
facto expulsion from the Conference) in July 1992, Belgrade 
demanded the withdrawal of CSCE observers from Kosovo and the 
Macedonian border. Needless to say, this reduced the 
Conference's ability to influence developments in the region. 
  Currently the role of the CSCE in European politics, though 
important enough, is more modest than expected. Its decisions 
lend all-Europe legitimacy to efforts exerted by individual 
groups of nations in conflict zones (as was the case in, say, 
July and August 1991, when the first extraordinary meetings of 
the CSO confirmed the EC mandate for mediation in Yugoslavia). 
The CSCE also performs an important function by establishing 
facts on the spot and monitoring developments through observers 
sent to conflict zones. 
  In some cases the Conference makes attempts at mediation 
that 
generally produce little effect.[.sup]1[/] The blame for 
disillusionment with its potentialities must obviously be put 
not so much on the organisation itself as on the excessive hopes 
and promises that found expression in 1990. Realising this fact, 
however, cannot add to the prestige of the CSCE. 
  This is evident from, for instance, Austria's approach to 
the 
Helsinki process. In March 1992, Foreign Minister Alois Mock 
made a sensational statement about Vienna's desire to seek a 
rapprochement with NATO structures.[.sup]2[/] Subsequently 
that trend in Austrian policy grew stronger even though it was 
offset by putting emphasis on closer relations primarily with 
the WEU.[.sup]3[/] It follows that Austria has in fact gone 
back on its earlier view of the CSCE as a highly important 
instrument of European security. 
  A debate on a rapprochement with or even entry into NATO is 
also going on in Finland. The Swedes are talking about the need 
to partly revise their traditional policy of neutrality. Swiss 
policy, too, betrays disappointment at the CSCE. It will be seen 
that the Conference's obvious failures and the drop in the 
rating of the concept of an all-Europe collective security 
system, like the emerging trend towards a rapprochement between 
ex-WTO members and the EC and NATO, directly face neutrals with 
the issue of their future place in new European security 
structures. 
<H5>  An Extended NATO? </H5>
  In 1990, NATO's starting positions in the new Europe did not 
at all seem preferable to those of the CSCE. True, both the 
London Declaration of its Council (July 1990) and documents of 
its Rome meeting (November 1991), which formulated the 
alliance's new strategy, underlined the need to preserve the 
alliance as an important instrument of European security. But 
due to controversies inside the alliance, primarily the attitude 
of France, the future of NATO looked most uncertain, all the 
more so because this organisation is associated with the sad 
legacy of the Cold War more often than others. 
  Paradoxical as it may seem, the alliance's new legitimacy 
received the strongest support from the pro-Atlantic position of 
East European countries, which have been saying, especially 
since January 1991, that they would like to join the alliance at 
some stage as full-fledged members. Yet there are many 
circumstances holding up such a transition. One of the 
stipulations of the accords on German unification reached by 
Mikhail Gorbachev with the West was the latter's readiness not 
to extend NATO's sphere of influence towards the East. Besides, 
the alliance itself was in no hurry to throw its door wide open 
to new members, fearing as it did that this might complicate 
decision-making and compel it to tackle problems of East 
European countries. What NATO proposed were mostly stopgaps. 
  In November 1991, after a long period of resistance from 
France, the Rome meeting of the NATO Council resolved to set up 
the NACC.[.sup]4[/] The latter's constituent meeting on 
December 20, 1991 coincided with the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union, and it was not long before sovereign states that 
had sprung up on ex-Soviet territory became NACC members along 
with East European and Baltia states. Compositionally, the only 
difference between the NACC and the CSCE today is that the 
former includes no neutrals although Finland secured observer 
status in June 1992 while Austria and Sweden in 1993 joined in 
drafting recommendations for peace-keeping operations. 
  The NACC and the working bodies formed by it have no 
explicit 
procedures. This may be regarded as a certain demerit but, on 
the other hand, it stresses the flexibility of the new 
structure, which makes no political decisions but offers 
nonparticipating states opportunities for dialogue with NATO. 
Besides assisting "partner states", as NATO now officially 
describes Central and East European countries, including the 
ex-Soviet Union, in a number of sectors agreed in 1992, the Ad 
Hoc Group for Peace-keeping Operations set up by the Council 
submitted to the fifth regular meeting of the NACC at the level 
of Foreign Ministers (Copenhagen, June 1993) recommendations for 
the promotion of interaction between European institutions in 
maintaining peace on the continent. 
  In the nearly two years since it was established, however, 
the NACC has evolved no clear vision of its role in ensuring 
European security. What is perhaps particularly typical of it is 
that it leaves various options open depending on developments in 
Europe. Occasionally it may become something of an anteroom of 
NATO through which a country wishing to join the alliance must 
pass and a transitional structure on the road to the formation 
of a collective security system. 
  Events of 1993 seem to have brought us visibly closer to the 
final solution of this dilemma. As late as 1992, nobody in NATO 
would hear of admitting any Central European countries (meaning 
primarily Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia) but in early 
1993 German Defence Minister Volker Ruhe made a cautious 
statement in favour of not ruling out such a possibility. 
  An unexpected change in the debate on this subject came 
about 
after President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Warsaw in August 1993. 
Previously Russia had taken a reserved or even negative stand on 
an extended NATO membership but in Warsaw the President said he 
"appreciated" Poland's intention to join NATO. "In the long 
term," said the Joint Russo-Polish Declaration of August 25, 
"such a decision by sovereign Poland, being directed towards 
all-Europe integration, does not run counter to the interests of 
other countries, including the interests of Russia." 
  The Warsaw Declaration was seen as Russia's consent to the 
inclusion of the four Central European countries in NATO 
although Russian diplomacy took steps to ease that impression by 
making a decision on this matter conditional on the evolution of 
relations between Russia and NATO. Be that as it may, the 
document signed in Warsaw created an important and irreversible 
precedent: it cannot be retracted. And while Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu in September 1993 said that Romania 
did not find it necessary in shaping its foreign policy line to 
ask Boris Yeltsin's or anyone else's permission, it would be 
hard to overestimate the Warsaw Declaration. Indeed, its signing 
was followed by a lively debate on the outlook for the admission 
of Central European countries to NATO, some comments striking a 
note entirely different from those sounded earlier. 
  Many in NATO still doubt the wisdom of extending its 
membership, and yet the general tenor of the debate suggests 
that the day is not far off when a fundamental decision may be 
made on this issue. In mid-October 1993, a spokesman for the US 
State Department said that the Administration was seriously 
considering the position it should adopt on an extension of 
NATO. Volker Ruhe on September 15 was more explicit -- he 
declared for admitting the four Central European countries to 
NATO. He even allowed for the possibility of their being 
admitted to NATO earlier than to the EC. 
  Discussion was postponed until the NATO summit in January 
1994, which is most likely to adopt a political decision paving 
the way for talks with Central European countries on their 
joining the alliance. This would probably be tantamount to the 
decision of the Copenhagen meeting of the European Council, 
which opened the door to the EC for several Central and East 
European countries. 
  As in the case of the EC, nothing is said about the possible 
time limit of admitting new members, but such a development 
would influence the formation of European security mechanisms by 
predetermining an option not in favour of building an all-Europe 
collective security system in at least the foreseeable future. 
  Since October last, the debate on extending NATO has centred 
on the concept of "partnership for peace", which US Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher advanced during his tour of Moscow, 
Alma-Ata, Kiev, and Minsk. His initiative met with approval in 
Moscow as well as in Paris and other West European capitals. Its 
substance has yet to be studied on the threshold of the Brussels 
summit of NATO scheduled for January 10 but the main ideas are 
clear: all NACC members can in principle join NATO provided that 
they meet a number of criteria (including reliable civilian 
control over the armed forces and a democratic system). 
Meanwhile they are invited to further their ties with NATO on a 
bilateral basis, in particular by preparing in common to join in 
peace-keeping operations. As for natural disasters, a longer 
list of areas of cooperation will have to be specified within 
NATO. 
  "Partnership for peace" nominally puts all NACC members on 
an 
equal footing but this initiative marks a change in the thinking 
of alliance members. The very possibility of extending NATO is 
no longer called into question. Approval of this concept at the 
Brussels meeting of the NATO Council will probably mean as much 
as the Copenhagen decision of the European Council. But NATO 
feels in no hurry to say a final yes to the question about which 
of today's seekers of membership are most eligible. Washington 
and Brussels alike are careful not to antagonise Russia so long 
as there remain prospects for democratic and market reforms 
here. Nevertheless, agreeing the parameters of "special" 
relations between Russia and NATO is bound to remove these fears 
and will go a long way towards opening the alliance's door to 
new members. 
<H5>  A New Yalta? </H5>
  There is no telling how far the likely echo of Boris 
Yeltsin's Warsaw statement was forecast and taken into account 
by today's makers of Russian policy, who are now engrossed 
primarily in internal affairs. It is beyond doubt, however, that 
such important decisions will necessitate modifications in 
Moscow's policy in both the short term and the more distant 
future. 
  The main effect of the events of last fall is unquestionably 
the near-inevitable extension of NATO by admitting primarily the 
four Central European countries, which may be followed later on 
by Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltia countries. Still, the 
problem is not that this may happen. Such a development could 
have been foreseen even earlier. The events in question have 
merely brought it nearer. The problem is the conclusion which 
Russian diplomacy must draw. 
  We have gotten away from the notion that NATO is an 
aggressive bloc. It is now clear that the alliance poses no 
threat to us. The important thing is that a fundamental 
political decision to extend NATO virtually would put an end to 
the debate on a European security system even if it were to set 
no timeframe for this. 
  The expanding West European collective defence system is 
becoming the mainstay of European security and will guarantee 
primarily the stability of its member countries more effectively 
than any other system. This means that interest in playing an 
active role in stabilisation outside this system now that a 
series of attempts in ex-Yugoslavia has failed will decline to 
the extent that developments outside the new zone of NATO 
responsibility are safe for the organisation's members. If this 
is true, Russian diplomacy must draw important conclusions. 
  First among them is the conclusion that the present emphasis 
on building up the CSCE needs to be revised for all that it is 
important for Russia to preserve organisational possibilities of 
developing all-Europe structures. The Helsinki process will 
hardly become the pivot of European policy in the foreseeable 
future. It is therefore necessary, as well as strengthening the 
CSCE, to adjust policy to closer interaction with West European 
and transatlantic structures, primarily the EC and NATO. 
  The question of promoting partnership with the EC is being 
discussed as preparations go on for a comprehensive treaty with 
the Community, including a provision for the creation of a 
mechanism for political dialogue between Russia and the EC, 
which has turned out to be probably the easiest thing in the 
course of the talks. The problem of NATO is a harder nut to 
crack. In view of the prospect of an extension of the alliance, 
there is reason to forecast (this is another point on which a 
decision must be made) the possibility of a gradual diminution 
of the role of the NACC, which largely owes its rise to a desire 
to draw Central European countries into the drafting of NATO 
decisions. It follows that Russian membership of the Council, 
which will retain its importance as a channel for dialogue with 
ex-Soviet republics, will hardly be enough as a means of 
bringing about proper interaction with NATO. 
  This leads Russian experts to various conclusions. Sergei 
Karaganov, for one, proposes making Russia's parallel joining of 
NATO one condition for the extension of the 
alliance.[.sup]5[/] I believe, however, that this is unlikely 
and that, besides, such a solution is unnecessary. It is 
obviously more important to agree with NATO (even before it 
admits Central European countries to membership) mechanisms for 
a direct political and military-political dialogue and 
interaction between Russia and NATO (without the NACC as 
mediator), such as would enable Russia to defend its European 
interests before the alliance makes decisions likely to affect 
these interests. If this were done, the seemingly negative 
consequences of extending NATO could be compensated for in the 
course of direct and close cooperation between Russia and NATO. 
  The more remote effects of political decisions to be made by 
Russia today seem far more complicated. After all, to extend 
NATO and the EC would mean seeking to finalise the West's 
priority interests in Europe, which is what they would 
concentrate on above all else. Because the geographic zone in 
question does not include the greater part of the ex-Soviet 
Union (except the Baltia states), such a decision would 
strengthen the tendency to recognise that Russia bears special 
responsibility for the maintenance of stability and peace in the 
CIS. 
  It is by no means accidental that visible concern about the 
prospect of an extended NATO is felt in the former European 
republics of the ex-Soviet Union, especially Ukraine, where an 
effort is being made to break out of the vast Eurasian area and 
"get rid", as some Ukrainians word it, of dependence on Russia 
by gradually integrating into European structures. 
  If this trend in Russian and European politics were to gain 
the upper hand, the result might prove paradoxical. Moving on 
from the postwar Yalta order, we would arrive at a new division 
of spheres of influence, not at a united Europe, and besides, 
Russia's sphere of influence would shrink greatly compared with 
that of the ex-Soviet Union. Couldn't this become a pretext for 
fresh redivisions of Europe after things in our country began 
looking up and Russia became once again a decisive factor in 
European politics, as we hope will be the case?

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Dzikic, plenipotentiary of the </F>
Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Moscow, by Seyfali 
Akhundov; place and date not given: "Ground War"] 
  [Text] Passions surrounding the war in Bosnia are not 
subsiding even after the West and Russia have done everything 
possible, or almost everything possible, to restore peace in the 
Balkans. In the opinion of Ibrahim Dzikic, plenipotentiary of 
the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Moscow, in order to 
treat the illness, one must have the proper diagnosis. 
  [Akhundov] How many Bosnian refugees are there in Moscow at 
present? Has the Russian Government rendered assistance in 
providing them services and utilities? 
  [Dzikic] There are no refugees in the legal sense of the 
word, because none of them are registered as such. But there are 
people who have fled the war or found themselves in Russia at 
the moment it began. I believe more than a thousand such people 
are in Moscow. And there are more throughout the territory of 
the CIS. There are about 4,000 refugees from Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. These include Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. Most of 
these people are working at Bosnian enterprises in Russia, 
primarily in construction. They are all registered with the Visa 
and Registration Administration, like any other foreigners. 
  [Akhundov] Do you not consider it the least bit strange that 
Russia has not to date established diplomatic relations with 
Bosnia? 
  [Dzikic] Mr. Silajdzic, Prime Minister of the Government of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, was recently in Moscow, where he stated 
candidly to Russian Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Kozyrev and his deputy, Mr. Churkin, that Russia's policy with 
respect to the countries of the former Yugoslavia was 
unbalanced. The absence of full-scale diplomatic relations 
between our countries is one more confirmation of this. One gets 
the impression that Russia is displaying a greater understanding 
of Serb-related aspects of the conflict in the Balkans. 
  [Akhundov] What are they fighting for in Bosnia? 
  [Dzikic] In Bosnia they are not fighting for their religious 
beliefs. In Bosnia they are fighting for land. The SFRY 
[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] collapsed--the 
communist idea ceased to exist. Then the Government of Serbia, 
headed by Milosevic, put its stake in nationalism. They wanted 
to create a Greater Serbia over most of the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were to become a part 
of this Greater Serbia. And that is when the war began. To 
implement their plans, the Serbs conducted ethnic cleansing in 
captured territories. There are just 1.3 million Serbs in 
Bosnia, while there are about 8 million throughout the territory 
of the former Yugoslavia. The Islamic community of Bosnia 
numbers 2 million--the descendants of devoutly religious people 
who adopted Islam in the 11th and 12th centuries. 
  At first a great deal was said about a third power being 
involved in this war. It seems to me this is not true. Were it 
not for Serbian nationalism, there would not be war either in 
Croatia or in Bosnia. The war in the territory of former 
Yugoslavia cannot be compared with the Karabakh conflict, or 
with the war in Georgia, or with the confrontation in 
Tajikistan--which certain commentators are attempting to do, 
justly pointing out that the geopolitical interests of major 
world powers are in confrontation in the three regions I 
mentioned. 
  [Akhundov] How does one distinguish Serb from Muslim, Croat 
from Serb, if they all speak the same language? 
  [Dzikic] Unless an individual declares what he is--Serb, 
Croat, or Muslim--it is practically impossible to distinguish 
among them. We have one language, Serbo-Croatian, and--if you 
can say it this way--one mentality. From time immemorial three 
religions have existed in Bosnia--Islamic, Orthodox, and 
Catholic--which, in turn, influenced in one way or another the 
formation of the ethnic groups professing them. The structure of 
civilization and world outlook are formed based on religion. 
There are no other distinctions. 
  [Akhundov] Volunteers from which countries are fighting on 
the side of the Bosnian Muslims? What would you advise an 
individual who asks you to help him make his way to the Bosnian 
Army as a volunteer? 
  [Dzikic] We do not have any problems and never have had any 
with people in the Army. We do not need volunteers from other 
countries. We need weapons. A great deal has been reported in 
the Russian press concerning volunteers from the Islamic states 
allegedly fighting on the side of the Bosnian Government, but I 
personally do not have such data. Other sources state that a 
great many Russians are fighting on the side of the Serbs. A 
certain Mr. Begayev approached me recently. He was involved in 
sending Russian volunteers to the war in Bosnia and asked my 
assistance in getting the bodies of two Russian mercenaries out 
of Bosnia. There was another curious incident, where a Muscovite 
came to our representation and asked me to help him....enlist in 
the Serbian Army. I advised him to go to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia Embassy, with a comment to the effect that he had 
made a slight error in the address. 
  [Akhundov] What do you think about arms shipments from 
Russia 
to the Serbs? How are these shipments effected? 
  [Dzikic] A great deal is said and written about this, but as 
always, there are very few specific facts. It is difficult for 
me, a representative of one of the concerned parties, to comment 
on this. I have one piece of information in this regard. At the 
end of January 1994, a convoy of eight trucks was dispatched 
from Russia to Bosnia. The cargo was intended for the Serbian 
forces. It consisted of anti-aircraft systems and surface-to-air 
missiles. I obtained the information from Sarajevo. All arms 
shipments to Serbian forces in Bosnia come out of Serbia and 
through Serbia. We have the names of officers in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia Army who died escorting military cargo 
from Serbia to Bosnia. 
  We have demanded that United Nations posts be set up on the 
border between Serbia and Bosnia, which would be able to control 
cargo shipments. However, the Serbs blocked any decision that 
could be made in this regard. 
  Russian society is very poorly informed as to what is going 
on right now on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Your 
newspaper correspondents in Belgrade fall under the influence of 
propaganda there. At first they were led to believe--and not 
without success--that the Slavs in Yugoslavia were exclusively 
Serbs. True, Russians have now come to understand that we are 
all Slavs. Then they put their stake on the Orthodox kinship. 
And now they are saying that Serbs are age-old allies of 
Russia--which in itself is not true. From ancient times, 
imperial Russia took advantage of either Bulgaria or Serbia to 
serve its interests in the Balkans. When it was friendly with 
the Bulgarians, the interests of the Serbs suffered, and vice 
versa. 
  [Akhundov] The emergence of an Islamic state in the Balkans 
does not elicit delight in the West or in Russia. Perhaps this 
is one of the reasons behind the continuing bloodshed? 
  [Dzikic] We have never desired to build an Islamic state. 
Our 
ideal is a civilized, secular country where religion is 
separated from the state and is the personal business of each 
citizen. We can cite Turkey as an example--a country that has 
developed for almost 100 years according to precisely such 
principles. We have wanted to continue to live the way we used 
to, together with Serbs and Croats. We were entirely unprepared 
for war. What is going on right now in Bosnia is aggression 
directed against us.

"Ankara Wants To Restrict the Passage of Tankers Through Its 
Straits. Moscow Will Most Likely Not Support This Action"] 
  [Text] An accident involving a supertanker carrying fuel 
that occurred in the Turkish Strait of Bosphorus last Sunday has 
made topical the issue of ensuring safety in the Straits of 
Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Previously, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Turkey made a statement that an increase in 
the intensiveness of transportation in the straits will pose a 
real threat to Istanbul and its 10 million residents. 
  A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from sources 
in the Turkish Government that a document strictly regulating 
procedures for the passage of ships through the straits will 
take effect 1 July of this year. In keeping with this document, 
which consists of 59 points, all tankers passing through the 
Bosphorus and the Dardanelles will have to notify the Turkish 
authorities about entering the straits in advance and have to 
pay duties, the volume of which will depend on the size of the 
tanker. 
  It is envisioned that in the event that the length of the 
tanker exceeds 150 meters, all traffic in the straits will be 
stopped for four to five hours. This will unavoidably result in 
a disruption of shipping and the forced layover of dozens of 
vessels. Naturally, the company-owner of the supertanker will 
have to defray all material costs entailed by this. 
  It is believed in Ankara that firm restrictions of this 
nature are a forced step in order to contain the intensiveness 
of shipping, which has recently increased sharply. Moreover, as 
soon as a few years after the beginning of the development of 
the Caspian Sea and Kazakhstan fields, about 30-40 million 
tonnes of oil will be carried through the straits annually, 
which will sharply increase the scale of ecological catastrophe 
should yet another accident occur. 
  The document prepared in the Turkish Government should be, 
in 
a way, a warning signal to neighboring countries that are 
considering the possibility of transporting oil through the 
Turkish straits. This concerns, in particular, three 
countries--Russia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. The Russian side 
is trying to convince Baku and Alma-Ata [Almaty] of the need to 
deliver the produced oil to the port of Novorossiysk, from which 
oil supertankers will transport it to the Mediterranean, 
naturally, through the Straits of Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. 
In turn, Ankara proposes to consider the possibility of building 
an oil pipeline which would run through Turkish territory. 
  Azerbaijan verbally supports the Turkish plan. However, the 
apprehension in Ankara is that Geydar Aliyev will not be able to 
withstand pressure from Moscow on this issue. Several days ago, 
Vakhid Alekperov, president of the Russian oil company Lukoyl, 
visited Baku; in the course of negotiations with the Azerbaijani 
company Sokar he stressed that materialization of the Russian 
project promises considerable economic advantage. It appears 
that Kazakhstan has already made its choice in favor of the 
Russian project. Besides, according to information from 
confidential sources in Ankara, Moscow has already secured 
support from the U.S. Administration with regard to its oil 
transportation project. Restrictions on the movement of tankers 
in the straits to be introduced by Ankara directly affect the 
interests of a consortium of Western oil companies that will 
soon begin the production of oil in the region. It is easy to 
foresee that Western companies, which are interested in the 
lowest outlays on transporting oil to Europe, will hardly want 
to pay duty for supertankers to enter the Turkish straits. 
  So far Moscow has been silent about the intention of the 
Turkish Government to restrict the movement of tankers in the 
straits. Apparently, at Smolenskaya Square they have so far been 
analyzing the results of the recently completed visit to Ankara 
of a technical group of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs headed by Yakov Ostrovskiy. A source in the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed a 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that in defining its position, 
Moscow will proceed from the Convention on Banning Restrictions 
on Shipping in the Straits of Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, 
which was signed in 1936 in Montreux. The Russian side may 
accuse Turkey of violating this international document. Ankara 
will respond to this accusation as follows: "Yes indeed, the 
Montreux convention establishes a free navigation regimen in the 
straits. However, the whole issue is that in 1936, when this 
document was signed, the large-size tankers we have now did not 
exist. Besides, the notion of using the straits to ship millions 
of tonnes of oil a year was not contemplated at that time." 
  Therefore, the dispute may become protracted; with regard to 
this issue, a lot will depend on which side the West and the 
United States support.

<F P=106> [Interview with Suleyman Demirel, president of the Republic </F>
of Turkey, by Aleksandr Gagua: "Russia and Turkey Are 
Responsible for Peace and Prosperity in the Region"; Ankara, 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Gagua] Mr President, you are coming out in favor of 
a new type of relations between Turkey and Russia, based on 
great trust and cooperation. Are you satisfied, from this point 
of view, with the present state of affairs, and what problems do 
you see in this sphere? 
  [Demirel] Turkey and Russia are the two great states of the 
region. I think that we are responsible for peace and prosperity 
not only in our region, but also in Europe and in the world. Our 
countries have maintained political relations for more than 500 
years. In the past there were conflicts and wars between us, but 
enmity does not have to continue forever. I do not believe that 
any country could build its policy on the basis of enmity. We 
must shake hands with one another and save the future. The 
people of our country, I know, is also interested in good 
relations. This is why I appeal for the creation of relations of 
peace, prosperity and friendliness, both today and in the future. 
  For several years I have advocated for us to have good 
relations with our northern neighbors--with Russia, with the 
former Soviet Union, irrespective of the regime existing in your 
country. Our cooperation must be based on mutual understanding, 
respect of independence, on non-interference in the internal 
affairs of one another, and on respect of territorial integrity. 
We do not want to interfere in your internal affairs, we respect 
your independence and territorial integrity, and we want to 
cooperate with Russia. 
  It is obvious that during the past few years our relations 
have entered a new era in their development and are based on 
common interests in the spirit of cooperation. The Agreement on 
the Principles of Bilateral Relations signed during my visit in 
Russia on 25 May 1992 and our negotiations with President 
Yeltsin have been the cornerstone in this process. Since that 
time our relations have begun to develop satisfactorily in all 
spheres. We have the opportunity for international cooperation. 
We are trying to create an Organization for Economic Cooperation 
of the Black Sea Countries. The director of this organization, 
who has just now been appointed (incidentally, he is a Russian) 
has come to Istanbul. And now this organization continues to 
develop its activity. 
  About 300 Turkish companies are operating in Russia. One of 
the construction firms has reconstructed the White House. We are 
buying natural gas from Russia. Turkey is open for the 
development of business activities. We have good relations in 
many spheres, and I do not see any reasons that would prevent 
their being maintained. 
  Both of our countries must very attentively strive not to 
darken our relations. On the government level we are acting in 
this manner. Trifles should not be given exaggerated 
significance. If something disturbs Turkey, we will communicate 
this to Russia. And if something calls forth the displeasure of 
Russia, it should tell the Turkish leadership about it. 
  I think that friendship and cooperation between Turkey and 
Russia will be beneficial for both of our countries. 
  [Gagua] For the first time in recent centuries Turkey does 
not have a land frontier with Russia. Now Turkey is bordered by 
new independent states--Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. What 
is the essence of Turkey's policy with respect to these 
countries? 
  [Demirel] I think that if peace and accord are established 
in 
Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, this will only be for the good 
of both Russia and Turkey. And if these countries are not at war 
with each other, this will be in the interest of both Russia and 
Turkey. I think that if peace is established in the Caucasus, 
including the countries that are members of the Organization for 
Economic Ccoperation of the Black Sea Countries, then this new 
type of interaction and cooperation can be developed. Yes, this 
is true, between our countries there is no land border, but we 
are located on opposite sides of the Black Sea. 
  [Gagua] Today the idea of the restoration of the former 
Soviet Union is acquiring more and more supporters. What do you 
think about this? 
  [Demirel] You know, after the recent elections, after the 
appearance of Mr Zhirinovskiy, one can talk about the fact that 
there are many people in Russia who are displeased with the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. They are displeased with the fact 
that the republics of Central Asia, the Transcaucasus, and the 
countries of East Europe are no longer within the sphere of 
influence of Russia. They believe that a new Russia should be 
created withing the borders of the former Soviet Union. It is 
natural that this is a subject of anxiety of many countries, not 
only Turkey. If Russia is going to be an imperialist state, it 
will lose the trust it now enjoys. If this happens, then, 
without a doubt, it will be a blow to many countries, who will 
begin to see a threat in Russia. After the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, all started to talk about the fact that the world 
no longer is divided into two diametrically opposed camps, that 
now the arms race will yield to peaceful development. 
  But if we preserve peace and cooperation, this will be good 
both for Russia and the other countries. You see, in this case 
we are working for the good and the prosperity of our peoples. 
But if we are at war with one another, we only inflict harm and 
misfortune on another, we condemn our peoples to poverty. 
  [Gagua] What is your attitude to the agreement signed by 
Georgia and Russia, according to which Russia obtains military 
bases in Georgia? 
  [Demirel] You know that by an agreement of the CSCE member 
countries, which many states signed, the quantity of arms in 
these countries must be under control. 
  As far as the agreement between Georgia and Russia is 
concerned, this is the affair of these states, and we should not 
be worried on account of this. 
  But Russia must observe the agreement on the quantity of 
arms 
in the region. 
  [Gagua] What do you think about the situation that has 
developed around the Crimean Peninsula? 
  [Demirel] The dispute over the Crimea is a dispute between 
Russia and Ukraine. We are interested in the fate of the Crimean 
Tatars, there are quite a few in our country, too. A 
considerable number of them live outside the boundaries of 
Ukraine and Russia, they are found even in New York and in 
Romania. Our interests with respect to the Crimean Tatars are 
not political. All we want is for them to be secure in their 
homeland and for them to be treated like people, you see, they 
are our brothers. 
  [Gagua] You probably know that Mr Nazarbayev, speaking at 
the 
United Nations, accused some Russian officials of conducting an 
imperialist policy. How do you assess this declaration? 
  [Demirel] I think he is concerned about the declarations of 
Mr Zhirinovskiy. I know what he thinks, I suggested to him to 
maintain peace in Kazakhstan; you see, Turkey knows that a 
significant part of the population of Kazakhstan consists of 
Russians. And if such is the composition of the population, you 
already cannot call the Russians a minority. But they enjoy the 
same rights as the other peoples of Kazakhstan. Moreover, the 
prime minister of Kazakhstan is of Russian descent, although he 
was born in Alma-Ata. You know that the destinies of these two 
countries--Russia and Kazakhstan--are closely interrelated and 
interwoven. Nazarbayev knows how attentively Russia treats the 
30-million strong population of Russian origin that is living 
outside the borders of Russia, and Russia rightfully is 
concerned about their security. Nazarbayev treats the local 
population with consideration, but, as far as I know, he is 
afraid of the Russian population, of the emigrants from Russia, 
he is afraid that they may separate from Kazakhstan. This is 
what he is anxious about. But he told me on January 20 in Davos: 
"First of all, I am a Kazakh, then a Russian, and then a Central 
Asian." He said that it is necessary to be very attentive so 
that Kazakhstan is not separated and torn away from Russia, 
because they have a great deal in common. I think that he is a 
sufficiently wise man, and I do not think that he will do 
anything that could call forth irritation in Russia or among the 
Russian population of the republic. I am not defending and 
justifying him, I am only explaining, since I am acquainted with 
his views, from his point of view, and I know what I suggested 
to him. 
  [Gagua] There are rumors circulating to the effect that 
during the recent visit of Mr Aliyev in Turkey an agreement was 
signed, according to which an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan will 
go through the territory of Turkey. Is this true? 
  [Demirel] No. In general, this is not a political, but an 
economic question. We would like for such a pipeline to go 
through Turkey, but we are not nudging and we are not pressuring 
other countries. Especially not those which have cultural and 
historical ties with us. All right, if such a decision will be 
in the interest of Azerbaijan. However, if this is only in the 
interest of Turkey, but does not benefit their country, we will 
not occupy ourselves with this. If this is useful to the people 
of Azerbaijan, we are glad about it, but, as I already said, 
this is not a political question. 
  [Gagua] Mr President, today in the republics of Central 
Asia, 
after a period of some euphoria, a certain disillusionment is 
noticeable. It would appear, they expected more from Turkey. Can 
you say anything in regard to this? 
  [Demirel] You know that these countries are our brothers, 
and 
for the duration of almost 70 years we have practically not had 
any relations with them. Two and a half years ago they became 
independent. We have concluded a number of agreements with them, 
we maintain telephone contact with them, they watch Turkish 
television broadcasts, there is a lively air traffic between our 
countries, citizens of ours are in these countries. About 1,000 
Turkish companies are operating in the republics of Central 
Asia. We are encouraging these states to step out into the world 
arena, to become members of the CSCE, the United Nations, etc. 
We have opened our embassies in these countries, and students 
from these countries are being trained in Turkey. We have 
granted them credits in the amount of more than $1 billion. Some 
part of the credits has already been used by these countries. 
Moreover, we have made it clear to them that we do not intend to 
control these countries, that they must govern themselves. We 
only want for them to preserve and maintain their independence 
both within their countries and with their neighbors, for them 
to support the development of their countries. To tell the 
truth, we are not afraid of any disillusionment on their part. 
We meet, we discuss various problems. They need to take up the 
realization of concrete projects, but they do not have 
sufficient personnel for this. As far as we are concerned, we 
are prepared to continue to do everything possible for them. If 
they are ready to continue work on these projects in the course 
of 10 years, this would be very useful. 
  [Gagua] Turkey reacted very sharply to the conduct of a 
Kurdish conference in Moscow. Do you believe that incidents of 
that sort can seriously complicate international relations? 
  [Demirel] You know how concerned we are with the problem of 
terrorism in our country. Up to now, Russia, our friend and 
neighbor, has conducted a very cautious policy in this question. 
You see, Russians know how we are suffering because of this. 
Moreover, all countries, including Russia, are devoted to the 
idea of the condemnation of terrorism and support the countries 
fighting against it. Chechen, Tatars, and representatives of 
other peoples come to Turkey from Russia, and if their stay is 
undesirable in Turkey, Russia should not allow them to do this. 
We have businessmen who work in Kazan, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, 
Chechnia, and our policy is that we do not incite anyone against 
Russians. To the peoples that live in Russia we say that they 
must have good relations with the Russians, since they are part 
of Russia. You see, if misfortune befalls them, no one will help 
them, simply no one can help. 
  As far as the new independent states are concerned, such as 
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Azerbaijan, we share the commonality of languages with them, the 
commonality of religion, and we tell these countries that they 
must have good relations with Russia. In no one's mind must the 
impression be created that terrorists receive any kind of 
support from Russia. I know the leaders of your country, Mr 
Yeltsin and Mr Kozyrev. These are very wise people, and I do not 
think that they will try to aggravate relations with Turkey in 
essence for nothing. 
  [Gagua] The tendency of the internationalization of the 
Karabakh conflict is becoming increasingly more noticeable. 
Lately we have learned about cases of the participation of 
Afghan mujaheddin in battles on the side of the Azerbaijani 
army. What is the position of Turkey on this question? 
  [Demirel] Turkey opposes any development of events that 
could 
lead to the internationalization of the continuing conflict 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In this conflict, Azerbaijan is 
the party whose territory is occupied, and this gives it the 
inalienable right to defend its territory against aggression. Of 
course, the CSCE countries agreed among themselves to seek ways 
of solving this conflict peacefully. Specifically for this 
purpose the Minsk Group was established, and it is the only 
forum where a just and long-term peaceful solution of the 
problem can be found. As far as the interference of foreign 
"volunteers" in this conflict is concerned, you should address 
this question to the parties involved in this. 
  [Gagua] Turkey has accused Armenia that camps of Kurdish 
terrorists are located on its territory. Armenia, in its turn, 
has characterized these accusations as groundless and as being 
made to please the domestic Turkish opposition. Could you not 
talk about this in greater detail? 
  [Demirel] Indeed, we are encountering signs of the presence 
of the RKK (Kurdish Workers Party) in various regions of Armenia 
and in territories occupied by Armenia. Turkey is continuing the 
conduct of investigations in regard to such information and is 
verifying the authenticity of this information. 
  The authorities of Armenia have several times expressed 
their 
determination not to allow any activity of the RKK. However, it 
would appear, the government of Armenia does not have full 
authority and control in certain territories. 
  I firmly believe that a clear-cut position taken against 
terrorism is a natural obligation for all states, and I am 
convinced that the authorities of Armenia will be attentive to 
the observance of this high obligation. 
  [Gagua] From the very beginning of the Karabakh conflict, 
Turkey has undertaken active efforts to solve it. Does it not 
seem to you that the presence of diplomatic relations with 
Armenia and an embassy in Yerevan would facilitate these efforts. 
  [Demirel] Turkey is prepared to establish diplomatic 
relations with Armenia if Armenia withdraws its troops from the 
territory of Azerbaijan and begins to fulfill the norms of 
international law after having put an end to the aggression 
against Azerbaijan. It should be remembered that Turkey is the 
first country which recognized the independence of Armenia and 
invited this country to take part in the creation of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation of the Black Sea Countries 
as a founding member. We have told them many times that they are 
wrong. We have conducted negotiations with Mr Ter-Petrosyan and 
other leaders of Armenia, we have proposed to them to take 
practical steps. Our policy with respect to Armenia is not based 
on enmity and we do not intend to carry out any hostile actions 
in regard to Armenia. 
  But if they want to exist in this region as an independent 
state, they must have good relations with Turkey. And then they 
can have access to Turkish ports and to Turkish highways, and 
they can make use of means of production in Turkey. 
  Armenian representatives have come to me and said that they 
need assistance, that their population is starving. They asked 
for wheat and I promised them supplies, they asked for electric 
power, and I promised them a supply of electric power. But, you 
see, they continue to kill people! They continue to occupy the 
territory of Azerbaijan! 
  We have stated to the leaders of the European countries that 
if the Western countries will publicly and openly support 
Armenia, and the Muslim countries will come to the assistance of 
Azerbaijan, a Muslim-Christian war will begin in the Caucasus. 
We are friends of Azerbaijan and when they turned to us: 
"Please, help us. We need your support and assistance, including 
military," we replied: "We can do this. But then what? You see, 
then the peoples of other countries will turn to us for 
assistance!" We want the settlement of the conflict within the 
framework of the existing state borders. I think, to a certain 
extent we will be successful. When I was in Moscow, I talked 
with Mr Yeltsin. We came out with joint declarations to the 
effect that we will promote the settlement of this conflict. But 
the opening of an embassy in Armenia will not help things from 
the point of view of our public opinion. At the same time, you 
know, Mr Ter-Petrosyan has come to Istanbul and to Ankara a 
number of times. What is more, several days ago representatives 
of Armenia and Azerbaijan were here. We talked very openly with 
them. 
  [Gagua] What is your view of the criticism being expressed 
by 
Western countries in regard to the violations of human rights in 
the south-eastern regions of Turkey? 
  [Demirel] Human rights constitute one of the cornerstones of 
the new European and world order. We share the position 
according to which this is no longer an internal issue of the 
state, that this is the common concern of the world community. 
  In the last few years a number of important initiatives in 
the sphere of human rights have been undertaken. An important 
improvement in this has been introduced by the Turkish criminal 
code, which allows arrested persons the presence of their 
lawyers at every interrogation. The same law provides for a 
significant reduction of the time in custody. Another 
significant event is the recent closing of all tribunals for 
extraordinary cases and the transfer of these cases to civil 
courts. Moreover, the courts are actively involved in the cases 
of the bureaucrats and officials who have committed human rights 
violations, and they will hand them a court sentence if their 
guilt is proved. 
  The situation with human rights in Turkey must be assessed 
in 
the context of the terrorism that the country has encountered. 
Terrorism is the chief enemy of human rights. Terrorism is not 
only in and of itself the most serious and large-scale form of 
violation of human rights, but it is also an obstacle to 
progress in the sphere of human rights. Thus, Turkey, by taking 
all measures for the struggle against terrorism within the 
limits of the observance of human rights, is fully resolved to 
liquidate this evil in order to protect the rights of its 
citizens. 
  [Gagua] Not long ago you advocated the abolition of the 
United Nations sanctions against Iraq. Do you thing that Irak 
has fulfilled all the conditions enacted for this country by the 
world community, or were you guided by some other reason? 
  [Demirel] When I turned to the question of United Nations 
sanctions against Iraq, I expressed the view that the sanctions 
have not led to positive changes, but, on the contrary, have 
brought the people a great deal of suffering. I also mentionedd 
the very heavy burden which Turkey continues to bear because of 
the sanctions. 
  However, I also pointed to the fact that Iraq continues to 
fulfill the requirements advanced by the United Nations in order 
to again occupy a place in the world community. I emphasized the 
significance of Iraq's return into the world community, both for 
Iraq itself and for the entire region. In what way this will be 
attainedd must be decided within the framework of the United 
Nations. 
  In conclusion of our conversation I would like to say that 
my 
message to Mr Yeltsin, transmitted through our prime minister, 
contains the wish for the successful completion of the reforms 
in Russia. 
  The attention of the entire world is now riveted on Moscow. 
If Moscow continues to be trusted, this will only be to its 
benefit and advantage. I wish Russia the successful completion 
of the transition from a communist state to a democratic state, 
from Marxist to a market economy. We know that this is not easy. 
But Turkey wishes Russia success, perhaps more than any other 
country in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yefimov, candidate of historical </F>
sciences: "Russia's Shuttle Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] It seemed that the Hebron tragedy had, if not 
aborted, thrown back the peace process. But the urgent efforts 
of Moscow have saved peace in the Near East. 
  The tragedy in Hebron on 25 February brought about a pause 
in 
a Near East settlement. The negotiations and, together with 
them, the hopes for an end to the most inveterate conflict in 
the Near East also were broken off. But Igor Ivanov, first 
deputy Russian minister of foreign affairs, set off on 27 
February for Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters, and then 
to Israel also. Andrey Kozyrev was in daily telephone contact 
with the Palestinian and the Israeli leadership. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation 
issued several decisive statements on the Near East, which 
express new ideas for an acceleration of the reconciliation of 
the Arabs and the Israelis. Viktor Posuvalyuk, special 
representative of the president of Russia for a Near East 
settlement, flew to see Yasir Arafat on 7 March. And on 11-12 
March, Minister Andrey Kozyrev himself visited Tunisia and 
Israel with messages from President Yeltsin, conducting 
intensive negotiations with the leadership of the PLO and 
Israel. And the outcome--Yasir Arafat has declared his readiness 
to return to the negotiating table. Russia has rescued, 
apparently, a seemingly hopeless situation. 
<H5>  Idle Fuss </H5>
  Following Moscow's successful demarche in the Bosnian 
conflict, which made it possible not only to avert a NATO 
military operation against the Serbs, but also to stabilize 
considerably the situation in Bosnia, the world once again began 
to talk about Russia as a great power whose legitimate interests 
could not be ignored. At the same time, on the other hand, 
arguments concerning new rivalry between the Russian Federation 
and the United States and Moscow's imperial ambitions were set 
in motion. And when Russian diplomacy intervened just as 
energetically in surmounting the crisis in the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations, it came to be argued in places that Russia had 
intruded into a sphere of vitally important American interests 
and had displayed "inordinate independence." 
  It is forgotten here that, first, Moscow and Washington 
operate, in accordance with the mandate of the Madrid Peace 
Conference, on an equal basis as co-sponsors of the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations; second, the Near East region is for Russia no 
less, and even more, important than for the United States, 
considering its direct geographical proximity to the southern 
borders of the Russian state; and third and finally, the efforts 
of Russian diplomacy were geared to the salvation of the peace 
process in the region, which more than corresponds to the 
Americans' interests. 
  Why the United States was this time unable to achieve what 
the Russians achieved, displaying on this occasion a strange 
passiveness in mediation, is another matter. Not Moscow's fault 
but Washington's dereliction consisted in the Americans' 
dragging out the adoption of an effective UN Security Council 
resolution guaranteeing a nonrecurrence of the Hebron tragedy. 
After all, one further such incident, and the file of the Madrid 
process may be closed. And it is by no means in the interests of 
either the Arabs or Israel to bury the 30 months of efforts of 
the complex and, at times, dramatic dialogue. 
<H5>  New Ideas </H5>
  The essence of the Russian proposals expressed since Hebron 
amounts to the quite simple, but very ample format: 1) the 
peaceful Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza 
obtains international guarantees of security under the 
conditions of occupation up to the final resolution of all 
problems, primarily via the dispatch of international observers; 
2) soundings are made concerning the possibility of the 
convening of a second plenary session of the Madrid Conference; 
3) the Arabs and the Israelis resume negotiations, and, first 
and foremost, the PLO and Israel accelerate realization of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  It was the first two points that were given a guarded 
reception by the United States and part of the Israeli 
Government. Their allergy to the proposal concerning the 
organization of Madrid-2 was particularly strong. For some 
reason or other, some prominent politicians in these two 
countries considered that Russia had conceived a desire to 
substitute for the present form of negotiations new ones, at 
which international patronage would prevail over direct 
bilateral dialogue. 
  But the explanations of the Russian diplomats dispelled all 
misgivings, with Yitzhak Rabin included: Two years and six 
months have elapsed since the Madrid Conference, and entirely 
new factors, of an extra-negotiation character included, are 
operating, and it would for this reason be better to evaluate 
collectively the path that has been covered, ascertaining its 
positive and negative aspects, and on the basis of a thorough 
analysis determining the prospects of development of the peace 
process for the future. After all, it is now sufficiently clear 
that the Madrid formula has worked positively for the 
Palestinians and the Jordanians, but has proven unproductive for 
the Syrians and the Lebanese. 
  Disputes arose also over how to guarantee the security of 
the 
Palestinian population. Moscow proposed a flexible option: 
Inasmuch as Israel has a negative attitude toward a UN 
"umbrella," the role of aegis of international presence could be 
performed by the two co-sponsors, with the enlistment of the 
countries that both the Israelis and the Palestinians find 
suitable. It was on this issue that Russia needed the support of 
the Americans, who skirted the demands of the Palestinians in 
silence, which evoked the accusation against Washington on the 
part of the Arabs of one-sided sympathy for Israel. 
  Ultimately, the Russian plan for stimulation of a Near East 
settlement was approved by both Israel and the PLO--as a result 
of the lightning visit of A. Kozyrev, both parties agreed that 
Russia and the United States should be the guarantors of the 
security of the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza 
and that a second session of the Madrid Conference could be very 
productive for imparting new international impetus to the peace 
process. On 12 March, Yasir Arafat, leader of the PLO, after 
negotiations with the Russian minister, gave his long-awaited 
consent to a return to the negotiating table. Also interesting 
is the fact that the Russian minister of foreign affairs brought 
the Palestinian leader from Jerusalem additional concessions of 
the Israeli Government, which were so much needed for a 
resumption of the peace process. 
  As far, however, as the talk about Russian-American rivalry 
in the Near East is concerned, it was conclusively buried at the 
meeting of the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian 
Federation and the U.S. secretary of state in Vladivostok on 14 
March, at which both sides confirmed their intention to continue 
to jointly advance an all-embracing and lasting peace between 
the Arabs and the Israelis. 
<H5>  What Next? </H5>
  Nonetheless, there are no grounds for undue optimism as yet. 
The Palestinian unrest on the occupied territories continues, 
and, consequently, people continue to die. Islamic extremists 
are threatening vengeance for the tragedy in Hebron. Radical 
Palestinian groupings are putting pressure on Arafat to 
terminate the negotiations with the "Zionist enemy." Iran, where 
large demonstrations of solidarity with the Palestinian 
fundamentalists are taking place, is adding fuel to the fire. 
  The Yitzhak Rabin government is in a difficult position 
also. 
The Israeli Labor Party members have made many good-will 
gestures and have accommodated a substantial part of the 
manifestly overstated demands of the PLO. This has given rise to 
the incitement of an atmosphere of hysteria by forces of the 
right, which are attempting to split Israeli society and 
stimulate the anti-Arab mood in the country. It is now sensed 
more than ever that the governing coalition is being torn 
between the firm intention to achieve peace agreements with the 
Arab countries as soon as possible and the entirely justified 
need to ensure the security of the state of Israel. It is 
perfectly obvious that a hand of friendship from outside needs 
to be extended to Rabin at the present difficult moment, and the 
Arabs should be doing this also. However bitter their feeling 
following the act of vandalism at Hebron's Al-Ibrahimiyyah 
Mosque, it should be understood that an Israeli Government made 
up of the political opponents of the Labor Party would never 
agree to the compromises that Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres 
have made. In the interests of a future peace, it is essential 
now to be guided by pragmatic considerations. 
  Something else is clear also--as long as Israel controls the 
occupied Arab territories, its army must guarantee the security 
of all its inhabitants more dependably. It would be expedient 
for this even now to begin negotiations on the status of the 
settlements, where the most extremist Israeli groupings 
frequently find refuge. Nor can the settlers be permitted to 
freely roam around the Palestinian localities with weapons, 
inasmuch as this could provoke new bloody outbursts. But the 
most important thing, which would make it possible to knock back 
the escalation of tension and instill confidence in the 
successful outcome of the peace negotiations, is the immediate 
fulfillment of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Having hoisted the 
PLO flag on their land, the Palestinians would really sense the 
first fruits of peaceful cohabitation with the Israelis. It is 
essential here to seek in parallel tangible progress in other 
areas of the negotiations also. Only then will a favorable 
background for the accomplishment of the tasks outlined in 
Madrid back in 1991 have been created.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Pustogarov, Dr of Law: "More Questions </F>
Than Answers: On the International Ties of the Subjects of the 
Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] Comparatively recently, new energetic 
figures--"subjects of the Russian Federation," Yaroslavl Oblast 
and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya), Buryatiya, and St. 
Petersburg have appeared in the international arena: They send 
official delegations abroad, they sign agreements with partners 
from the near and the far abroad, and they open representations 
there. In the case of some subjects of the Russian Federation, 
the agreements with foreign states number already in the dozens, 
but, very likely, not a single federal department has a complete 
picture of their international activity today, since these 
international ties are developing in many respects chaotically, 
without the proper coordination within the scales of the 
Federation. 
  The chief reason for the chaotic development is the lack of 
a 
corresponding legal base. The only provision that one can be 
guided by is one of the points of Article 72, which includes 
"the coordination of international and foreign economic 
relations of the subjects of the Russian Federation" among the 
subjects of joint jurisdiction. Consultation of the Federal 
Agreement allows one to clarify that the subjects of the Russian 
Federation are "independent participants" of such ties (Article 
III). 
  The available legislative base is not only scant, but 
extremely indeterminate, and at times poorly formulated. It 
gives rise to more perplexed questions than it provides clear 
answers. What is meant by "international ties?" The authors of 
the Constitution clearly wanted to underscore that these are not 
"international relations" that pertain to the jurisdiction of 
the Federation itself. But in what consists the difference 
between them? Elucidations in regard to this cannot be found 
either in the Constitution, or in foreign legislation, or in 
international law. It must be stated that the key concept of our 
legal base--"international ties" does not have a concrete 
juridical content. 
  And what is an "independent participant of international 
ties?" In relation to whom is it independent? In relation to the 
Federation? And to what extent is it independent--without any 
limitations or with limitations? As we see, this concept, too, 
does not have concrete juridical content, and it is impossible 
to find its interpretation [rasshifrovka] either in foreign 
legislation or in international law, since such a term does not 
exist there. 
  Perhaps, things are still more difficult with respect to 
"the 
coordination of international relations." Throughout the world 
the coordination of the international activity of the subjects 
of the federation is effected (in various forms) by the federal 
authorities. Originally (in the Federal Agreement) this is how 
it was planned in our country, too. But the Constitution for 
some reason included such coordination in the joint 
jurisdiction. In practice, this means that coordination of the 
international relations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, to put it mildly, is 
not entirely lawful, since both ministries are not joint organs, 
but organs of the federal executive authority. 
  De facto there exists at the present time a vast vacuum in 
the sphere under review--a vacuum that may have serious negative 
consequences and for this reason should be filled very soon. 
  From a legal standpoint, the best way out of the situation 
that has developed would be the adoption of a relevant 
constitutional amendment [novella]. However, the present policy 
and juridical situation in the country make such a path 
improbable. A more realistic and satisfactory solution is the 
adoption of a federal law on the international and foreign 
economic ties of the subjects of the Russian Federation. 
  In the given context, there is no possibility of examining 
the conception of such a law. But it is expedient to point out 
some key aspects. 
  Taking into account world practice and our own experience, 
the right of the subjects of the Russian Federation to 
agreements with foreign states should be anchored in the law. 
Here one can utilize the experience of the FRG, whose 
Constitution establishes: "In so far as the laender [states] 
have the power to legislate, they may, with the consent of the 
Federal Government, conclude treaties with foreign states" 
(Article 32). 
  The law should precisely define the rights of the subjects 
of 
the Russian Federation to permanent representations abroad. The 
subjects of other federations have many dozens of such 
representations, and the rich world experience must find 
reflection in the law. In particular, it is important to point 
out that the foreign representations of the Russian Federation 
act outside the sphere of the authority of the embassies and 
consulates of the Federation. 
  The law will have to establish a concrete mechanism for the 
coordination of the international activity of the subjects of 
the Russian Federation in accordance with both the Constitution 
and with international law. Here it is expedient to establish a 
mechanism for the examination of disputes in regard to the 
application of the powers of the Federation and its subjects. 
  The law, naturally, must establish the rights as well as the 
obligations of the subjects of the Russian Federation, including 
the conscientious fulfillment of both their own international 
obligations and the obligations of the Federation. The 
agreements of the subjects of the Russian Federation must not 
contradict the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the 
international obligations of the Russian Federation. 
  Finally, the law must establish that the maintenance of 
international links is effected by the subjects of the Russian 
Federation at their own expense. This last limitation, possibly, 
will break up some ambitious designs, but it is necessary for 
the development of normal federative relations. 
  On the whole, the law is called upon to guarantee the unity 
and effectiveness of the international activity of the Russian 
Federation on the basis of the powers of the Federation and its 
subjects and with mutual consideration of their interests. 
  In the discussion of the proposed law, it should be taken 
into account that at the present time, in the overwhelming 
majority, the 89 subjects of the Russian Federation have neither 
sufficient experience nor an adequate number of trained 
personnel. If it is our desire for the law to function on the 
level of international standards, it is necessary to assist the 
subjects of the Russian Federation. Since the problem has 
all-Russian dimensions, the adoption of a long-term federal 
program of support for the international ties of the Russian 
Federation is expedient, in my view.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin: "The Proposition Concerning </F>
Moscow's Neoimperial Ambitions: It Is Hardly Expedient for the 
West To Try To Persuade Russia of This"] 
  [Text] The pinning of various labels on Russia's foreign 
policy has been fashionable as of late overseas. The most 
prevalent has been the proposition concerning the revival of 
great-power ambitions. It is maintained that Moscow's "imperial 
policy" is not some new phenomenon, it is inherent, it is said, 
in the very nature of the Russian state. The democratic focus of 
Russia's foreign policy is being called in question on these 
grounds. Some Western politicians are even outlining the 
standards of behavior in international affairs which Russia does 
not have the right to transgress. For disobedience, such 
punishments as an end to the organization of the strategic 
partnership with Moscow, the accelerated admittance of the 
Central and East European countries to NATO, a revision of the 
plans for rendering Russia economic assistance, and much else 
are threatened. 
  Our opponents are particularly irritated by the fact that 
Russia is today organizing its foreign policy in accordance with 
its national priorities, giving relations with the states of the 
CIS and the Baltic pride of place. This has afforded a pretext 
for Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian opposition, 
to talk about realization of a "Kozyrev-Zhirinovskiy doctrine 
for the purpose of restoration of the Union." Polish Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski is constantly talking about the 
imperialist trends in Russia's foreign policy. Individual 
participants in a recent international security conference in 
Munich displayed their inordinate concern at the way in which 
Russia is defending its national interests. 
  Quite sharply worded anti-Russian statements were heard at 
an 
international seminar on Central Asia and the Caucasus in 
Tehran. They boil down to Russia being fingered as the principal 
source of danger for the independence and sovereignty of the CIS 
countries. Inventions concerning recompense for those same 
imperial ambitions of Moscow and its involvement in the 
incitement of regional conflicts are being whipped up. People in 
the near abroad are also, to our great distress, being pulled 
into this unseemly campaign at times. Lennart Meri, president of 
Estonia, and Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the Supreme Council 
of Ukraine Foreign Affairs Committee, like to expatiate apropos 
Moscow's "imperial subterfuges." 
  Russia, like any important power, has its own geopolitical 
reference points. Moscow cannot formulate its foreign policy on 
assurances of like-mindedness and solidarity. Together with a 
concurrence of interests it has also specific zones of priority 
attention. This, it would seem, is an attribute of international 
relations. The United States, for example, has repeatedly 
declared Latin America and the Near East regions of its direct 
interests. According to American press information, Washington 
has ranked far-off Lithuania here also. Vilnius deems relations 
with countries of Central and North Europe a priority. In Warsaw 
Hanna Suchocka, former prime minister, constructed four main 
areas of Poland's foreign policy activity. The Russian area is 
mentioned only in the context of the Republic of Poland's 
membership of NATO. 
  American observers, incidentally, do not reject the concept 
recognizing the right to exist of regional spheres of influence 
of the leading world powers, Russia included. Its essence is 
that in their zones they are in that case required to act in 
accordance with the rules of international law and under the 
scrutiny of the world community in the shape of regional 
associations. It is symptomatic that British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd considers the fact of Russia's interests in the 
Baltic region perfectly normal. 
  Attributing neoimperial postulates to Moscow in this context 
is not only unethical but inappropriate. It is not pursuing 
tactics of intimidation or domination in any regions of the 
world and is not undermining the independence of other states. 
Russia does not have territorial claims on anyone, and its new 
military doctrine is geared exclusively to defensive purposes. 
Which cannot be said about that same Estonia, which is making 
territorial claims on a number of areas of Pskov Oblast. One 
wonders how far these claims are compatible with the aspiration 
to become a full member of NATO, not to mention the Helsinki 
accords and the Paris Charter for a New Europe. 
  Russia is oriented toward the European system of general 
security which is being formed. It treats respectfully the forms 
of international interaction which are being tested. But the 
West sometimes thinks differently. Attempts are made at times to 
impose its viewpoint on Russia at the time of the discussion of 
problems of the former Yugoslavia and the Libya and Iraq 
situation. Such a policy without Moscow is doomed to fail. It 
would inevitably lead to a new spiraling of opposition in Europe. 
  Russia's expansion is discerned also in its peace-making 
efforts at "flash points" of the former USSR. The epithets with 
which Moscow is being rewarded for its mediating mission in the 
disengagement of the belligerents are innumerable. It is being 
recalled constantly that the CSCE has the key role in a 
settlement of the conflicts on the territory of the CIS. But 
Russia has never disputed the significance of such missions of 
this organization, as, equally, CSCE circles recognize Russia's 
efforts for a settlement of the conflict situations in certain 
former Soviet republics. But the CSCE alone is not in a position 
to extinguish the interethnic clashes in the former USSR. Local 
national leaders have been forced into this conclusion also, 
although there is not complete unanimity between them, of 
course. In a joint message to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, 
Eduard Shevardnadze and Boris Yeltsin proposed consideration as 
soon as possible in the UN Security Council of the issue of a 
peacekeeping operation performed by the United Nations or with 
its approval in Abkhazia based, if need be, on a Russian 
military contingent. 
  There has been no adequate response in the West as yet to 
Russia's sincere desire to establish peace at operational points 
of the CIS. There is, I believe, just one reason: fear of 
Russian hegemony on the territory of the post-Soviet space. 
  Russia's endeavor to protect the elementary rights of the 
Russian-speaking population in Estonia, Latvia, and other 
republics of the former USSR has been christened "great-power 
approach" in certain overseas circles. Moscow's efforts in this 
direction, of a diplomatic nature, as a rule, are seen as 
nothing other than "political pressure, economic blackmail, and 
aggressive intentions," and Estonia unabashedly employs the term 
"intervention" even. And this despite the fact that only 42,300 
Russians have Estonian citizenship, whereas the total number of 
Russians in the Republic of Estonia constitutes approximately 
half a million. And it is very odd that such discrimination is 
proving no hindrance to the process of enlisting the Baltic in 
Western security structures which has begun. The concerted 
actions of the West in defense of the suffrage and civil rights 
of the nonindigenous population in the Baltic would undoubtedly 
weaken the anti-Russian campaign there and would be a serious 
test of the viability of the policy of partnership. The findings 
of international civil rights organizations are going in one ear 
and out the other in Tallinn and Riga, meanwhile. And more 
pressure is being put on Russia in respect to withdrawal of the 
troops. It is not that far off, but Russian people will remain 
here. And if the discrimination against them continues, will 
this not threaten a repetition. Other countries have repeatedly 
demonstrated to the world far from legal means and methods for 
defense of the interests of their citizens. And public protests 
were barely audible. Russia's position on this issue, however, 
is for some reason or other invariably equated with "imperial 
policy." It is hardly expedient to prompt Moscow to come to 
believe in its "hegemonism."

<F P=106> [Article by KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator S. Tsekhmistrenko, </F>
under rubric "Problem of Arms Export":"Monopolist Paves the Road 
to the Market With Good Intentions"] 
  [Text] When, for the purpose of increasing the 
effectiveness of weapons export, the single Rosvooruzheniye 
State Company (general director Vladimir Samoylov) was created 
late last year, it was assumed that the company's chief task 
would be not only the restoration of state monitoring of that 
specific type of foreign-economic activity, but also making it 
easier for direct producers to gain access to foreign markets. 
It was repeatedly proclaimed that, in exchange for acting as a 
middleman, Rosvooruzheniye would receive the commission that is 
customary in that sphere (3-5 percent of the total value sold). 
However, from the very beginning one could easily discern the 
new company's striving to achieve a monopoly, in which the 
producers see a threat to their independence not only in the 
foreign markets, but even in arms production itself. That 
tendency may become intensified: as has become known to 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY, at the present time the Russian government is 
considering a plan to provide Rosvooruzheniye with interest-free 
credit for a total of one trillion rubles for a three-year 
period in order to use weapons shipments to pay off the Russian 
state debt to a number of Asian states. In the opinion of 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator Sergey Tsekhmistrenko, in the event 
of a positive resolution of this question, the producers, 
practically speaking, will be deprived of the opportunity to 
exert any kind of influence on weapons export. 
  Production Is Nothing, Acting as a Middleman Is 
Everything! 
  The creation of Rosvooruzheniye was influenced primarily by 
the fact that the abolition in 1990 of the state monopoly on 
military-technical cooperation (VTS) had a rather large number 
of negative consequences. Several of the factually independent 
foreign-trade associations that appeared in the foreign markets 
(although, organizationally, most of them were part of the MVES 
[Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations]) began aggressively to 
lure clients from one another, and that inevitably led to 
dumping, and, not infrequently, also, in general, to a loss of 
customers, together with whom entire sectors of the market were 
also lost. Something that became a classic example was the sale 
of MiG-29's to Malaysia, when Oboroneksport and 
Spetsvneshtekhnika fought for the right to become the supplier. 
There were also rather frequent instances of unsanctioned 
export, and the sensationalistic story with the appearance of 
the latest T-80U tank in Great Britain is only the tip of an 
iceberg, the bulk of which is concealed from the public. Under 
these conditions one could welcome the restoration of the state 
monopoly of VTS. if it were not for one circumstance: monopolism 
in Russia most frequently took on the form of ugly mutations, a 
form that was far from what was expected, 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-034-76A>      Correlation of Russian (USSR) and U.S. Arms Export in 1988-1992 (in billions of dollars </FIG>


  If one analyzes the experience of trade in weapons abroad, 
one can see that, practically everywhere, the producer stands in 
first place, while the middlemen (who, most frequently, are paid 
from the budget) who are working on commission only help to 
obtain the necessary state licenses and authorizations, and also 
to find foreign agents. Something similar (and good) was also in 
people's minds during the creation of Rosvooruzheniye, with the 
producers harboring the hope that they themselves would 
determine the export price of their output and would 
independently make settlements with the budget after the payment 
of the commission to that company. Actually, however, for the 
time being things seem to be turning out just the other way 
around, and in this regard one can assume that if the rumors 
about the credit are not devoid of foundation, then the 
situation will develop as follows. 
  After receiving credit, Rosvooruzheniye will actually be 
able 
to use it to pay for the production of the arms that are 
necessary to pay off the debt to the militant Asians. But even 
in this instance the company is also already acquiring the 
features of the actual owner of what was produced, while the 
producer-executors are taking the risk of remaining in "happy" 
ignorance relative to the sale price. But the remaining part of 
the credit, according to the practice that has developed and has 
become widespread in Russia (it is only a lazy recipient of 
preferential credit who does not do this) will most likely be 
deposited in a commercial bank. The money that has been built up 
there simply at the expense of the runaway interest will return 
to the state accounts in the original amount, but not until 
three years later. The credit recipients, obviously, will 
attempt to take the path of such well-known firms as LLD and 
Erlan (one might recall the television commercial, "Today you 
make a purchase at LLD, and a year from now all your money will 
be returned to you"), which, incidentally, are playing with 
inflation for only one inning (that is, one year). 
Rosvooruzheniye's authorized banks, however, are Menatel, 
Most-bank, Intermed, and the Moscow National Bank. As a result, 
the real profit received by Rosvooruzheniye will greatly surpass 
the modest commission that is generally accepted throughout the 
world, which commission was previously mentioned. 
  I'll Give You a Trillion, but I Don't Answer for the 
Consequences 
  In the story with credit there is yet another curious 
detail. 
All things considered, Rosvooruzheniye intends to become the 
authorized agent of the Russian government in paying off the 
foreign indebtedness. Although the company has absolutely no 
right to do this, since it is stated in its charter that, with 
regard to the state's obligations, it is not responsible 
(incidentally, as strange as it seems, the government also is 
not responsible for Rosvooruzheniye's obligations. In this 
entire scheme, which at first glance seems to be hypothetical, 
it is not clear as to whether the Asians themselves are 
interested in the wave of shipments of Russian weapons that are 
ready to come crashing down on them at any moment. MVES experts 
who wanted to preserve their anonymity stated to a 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY commentator that, in their opinion, the rumors 
that have been intensively spread in the SMI [mass media], to 
the effect that the Chinese are sleeping and see themselves 
behind the controls of dozens of imported SU-27 and SU-30 
fighter aircraft, have been greatly exaggerated. Those experts 
feel that Beijing is counting on either purchasing production 
licenses from Russia, or (by inviting individually Russian 
specialists in the VPK [military-industrial complex] simply 
stealing the know-how "part by part." Another potential buyer of 
military technology -- Iran -- has already assimilated the 
production of T-72S tanks and BMP [armored personnel carriers], 
and the sheiks and emirs on the shores of the Persian Gulf who 
have recently become promising have preferred the French Leclerc 
tanks to Russian ones. 
  Something else that attracts attention is the fact that a 
possible argument that can given by those requesting credit 
(another one is simply not discernable) -- the necessity of the 
partial prepayment of production of arms for export -- to put it 
mildly is not completely correct. Because during previous years 
more than a sufficient quantity of arms for export was already 
produced. Thus, according to data provided by the Ilyushenko 
Commission, which last year verified the activities of the MVES 
in arms exporting, the amount of weapons produced in 1992 
specially for export came to a total of $3.1 billion, but arms 
with a total of only $1.1 billion were delivered to foreign 
customers. The rest of the weapons continue to gather dust in 
depots (some of those arms have already been paid for 
--approximately $1 billion worth). 
  In the opinion of the MVES experts who were mentioned, by 
pursuing the good goals of helping the enterprises in the 
military-industrial complex and compensating their production 
expenditures, Rosvooruzheniye is choosing not the most effective 
means. Incidentally, another alternative is not precluded: the 
mentioned MVES experts, by representing the interests of 
Rosvooruzheniye, are attempting to lobby in their favor at the 
very moment when, in the apparatus of First Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets, the government's opinion concerning the future of the 
exporter monopolist is being worked out.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Simonov, under the "Situation Involving </F>
Currency Bonds" rubric: "Vneshekonombank Bonds May Become a Bone 
of Contention"] 
  [Text] The process of redemption of the bonds of the 
USSR Vneshekonombank [Bank for Foreign Economic Relations] which 
were issued to cover its domestic debt will apparently 
contribute to a string of financial scandals around this 
legendary institution. As the date of the first payments draws 
closer, many of the reluctant creditors of the VEB [Bank for 
Foreign Economic Relations] have finally grasped that all of 
them have been granted far from equal rights during the 
repayment of the debt and have snapped out of the state of 
preholiday euphoria. For example, the clients of the VEB itself 
are now wondering why commercial banks that have kept the funds 
of foreign economic associations similar to their own have been 
granted the right to unfreeze their savings 14 years sooner. The 
commercial banks themselves are guessing at the mechanism for 
transferring real money to their clients, which is not known to 
anyone. 
  While the Ministry of Finance, the VEB, and the Central 
Bank of Russia keep silent, the most impatient organizations 
have begun to make preventive attempts to "enliven" the money 
through commercial banks. As was to be expected, given the state 
of a legislative vacuum, this could not but cause incidents. A 
conflict between the Imperial and Lefortovskiy Banks became the 
first such incident; arbitration proceedings between the two 
will begin on Thursday. 
  In the opinion of KOMMERSANT, the foundation for future 
conflicts was laid by the authors of the government decree of 15 
March 1993. Let us recall that according to this document, the 
repayment of the currency debt of the VEB must be effected in 
five stages over time. In the process, commercial banks were 
granted the most preferential terms: The government resolved 
fully to redeem bank bonds, making the first payments in an 
amount of about $100 million as early as 14 May 1994. The 
situation of foreign economic association-clients of the VEB 
itself turned out to be the least attractive. Their debts will 
be paid back only from May 2003 on; the government is planning 
to fully settle with the associations as late as the year 2008. 
Besides, commercial banks were to receive bonds for the entire 
amount of the debt, whereas, in keeping with the letter of the 
Central Bank of 14 February 1992 "On the Legal Succession of the 
Russian Federation With Regard to the Obligations of the Former 
USSR by Virtue of Currency Accounts at the USSR 
Vneshekonombank," organizations that had accounts with the VEB 
itself may count only on some of the "frozen" funds less debts 
to foreign creditors (by now, these funds constitute the foreign 
debt of the state). 
  It is noteworthy that the funds that the authors of the 
decision, specialists from the Ministry of Finance and the VEB, 
view as debt to commercial banks are nothing other than the 
funds of their clients, primarily the same foreign economic 
associations. Under the circumstances, the actions of some VEB 
clients involving the sale of their "frozen" accounts to private 
structures from among the commercial banks under their tutelage 
are easy to understand. On the contrary, the principles from 
which the authors of the regulations proceeded, whose official 
obligation it is to resolve the issues of the foreign debt of 
the state, are completely unclear. 
  As "X-hour" drew nearer, it became clear that the process of 
"enlivening" the money would not be easy for anyone. The point 
is that in the already mentioned chain "the VEB--the commercial 
bank--the client," the government document regulates only the 
relations between the VEB and the commercial bank in whose 
correspondent account the money was frozen. The document does 
not at all touch on how much the clients of the bank should 
receive and in what manner. As stated by Mr. Gatsenko, the chief 
of the currency department of the Ministry of Finance of Russia, 
a commercial bank that has received VEB bonds "can either 
distribute the bonds to its clients or allocate currency to them 
out of its own resources." At the same time, Deputy Minister of 
Finance Igor Selivanov explained that the bank should discuss 
the principles and terms for the placement of bonds directly 
with the clients, "proceeding from the contract on settlement 
services." As a poll of bankers engaging in bond operations 
revealed, the Mezhekonomsberbank and the Inkombank have taken 
full advantage of such advice; they have embarked on 
distributing the bonds of the first tranches to clients 
(proceeding from a logical discourse). 
  At the same time, following such explanations many banks 
came 
to feel like unattached travelers lost in the woods by night. 
Having received bonds in the total amount of the debt to their 
clients, they still do not have official data on the amount of 
the debt of each organization to the state. If such information 
is announced after the fact, but the bonds will have already 
been received by the legitimate owners, the banks may possibly 
have to pay the state debt of their clients. 
  A conflict between the Imperial and Lefortovskiy Banks may 
very well be considered an illustration of the above. 
Proceedings involving them will begin tomorrow at the Moscow 
Arbitration Panel. A client of Imperial, the foreign-economic 
association Tekhnopromiport, sold $15 million "frozen" at the 
VEB to a certain commercial structure-client of the Lefortovskiy 
Bank in April 1993 at the rate of R100 [rubles] to the dollar. 
Some time later, Lefortovskiy, which in turn is a holder of a 
blocked correspondent account at Imperial, suddenly demanded 
that this amount be transferred to its correspondent account 
abroad, but this time in "live" form. It does not make sense to 
engage in polemics about the logical flaws in these 
instructions, especially given the fact that at present, the 
debt of the Tekhnopromimport to the state comes to about $400 
million, according to some data. Imperial, which refused to 
transfer funds for reasons that are quite easy to understand, 
was slapped with a "desperate" lawsuit for $15 million by 
Lefortovskiy. 
  Commenting on this "transaction," Chairman of Imperial Bank 
Sergey Rodionov stated that, regardless of the outcome of the 
proceedings, the bank intends to return to the VEB the bonds 
issued by the government in an amount equivalent to the debt of 
the bank to Lefortovskiy. Imperial intends to postpone the 
distribution of securities to other clients until the issue is 
settled legislatively. It has come out that the Stolichnyy and 
Russian Credit banks have also resolved to wait for a precise 
legal interpretation of the issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova under the "New Order of the </F>
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations" rubric: "They Want To 
Eat the Apple of Discord at Smolenskaya Square"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the MFER [Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations] of Russia issued an order on restoring the 
Main Administration for Investment Cooperation within the 
organization of the ministry. Simultaneously, the MFER submitted 
to the Government of Russia a draft of the decree "On Making 
Amendments and Additions to the Regulations on the MFER in 
Conjunction With the Subordination of the Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR) to the MFER 
and the Establishment of the Federal State Office `Russian 
Center for International and Cultural Cooperation.'" The RAMSIR 
has long been an apple of discord between its former and current 
masters. The MFER decree and the draft decree of the government 
should codify the role of the ministry as the overseer in 
investment issues. 
  The MFER of Russia intends to assume "regulatory functions 
in 
the area of attracting foreign investment to the Russian 
Federation" because, as the text of the draft decree reveals, 
the ministry considers itself a legal successor of the RAMSIR, 
"insofar as this Agency has operated to perform the above 
envisioned functions." Along with the functions of the RAMSIR, 
the MFER should also take over 75 of its employees. However, 
regardless of the decisions to be made by the RAMSIR personnel, 
the MFER is already recruiting cadres for its new main 
directorate. It is proposed that the RAMSIR itself be 
transformed into the Russian Center for International and 
Cultural Cooperation (that is to say, some kind of an analog of 
the Council of Societies for Friendship With Foreign Countries). 
It will now be charged with carrying out the edict of the 
president "On Russian Scientific and Cultural Centers Abroad." 
It is planned to appoint Valentina Tereshkova, the former 
chairman of the SSOD [Union of Soviet Friendship Societies], to 
head the new department. 
  In addition to the already mentioned documents, the MFER 
simultaneously submitted to the government two others. It is 
proposed that the system of centralized exports be modified. The 
MFER proposal calls for transmitting state quotas to individual 
exporters through the tender committee of the ministry. Besides, 
the MFER insists on canceling export duties on all goods. Both 
drafts fit very well within the policy of liberalizing foreign 
economic relations which the MFER is now pursuing. 
  [Boxed item begins] 
<H5>  From Order No. 109 of the MFER of Russia </H5>
  1. The Main Directorate for Investment Cooperation shall be 
restored. 
  2. The Main Control and Finance Directorate shall prepare 
position and wage fund assignments for the newly created 
directorate. 
  3. The Facilities Directorate shall provide the necessary 
official premises and create conditions for the regular 
operation of the newly created main directorate.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Clouds Appear in Russia's </F>
Investment Skies"] 
  [Text] One of the largest United States companies, 
Russel 20x20, yesterday expressed its readiness in principle to 
cooperate with Russia, in particular within the framework of 
establishment of a fund for the insurance of foreign 
investments. The declaration was made during the course of talks 
at the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and 
Development (RAICD). Quite a number of proposals of this sort 
continue to be received by the agency, whose status today, 
incidentally, is quite hazy (on 16 March KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
reported certain proposals regarding its fate). The West has 
apparently taken seriously the statement made by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin at the end of last year that 1994 will become "the 
year of investments." And it is not easy to explain to investors 
that the situation is not in fact shaping up all that smoothly. 
They would not understand. 
  Taking the operational experience of similar agencies into 
account (they exist in virtually all the developed countries), 
RAICD has proposed its concept of the formation of investment 
insurance institutions. At its initiative, we already see the 
establishment of the Russian Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development and two corporations--the Russian Financial 
Corporation and State Investment Corporation. Among plans not 
yet realized is the establishment of an independent tender 
committee and, finally, the Multilateral Agency for Guaranteeing 
Investments in Russia (including guarantees from political 
risk). To form the latter, it is proposed to create an 
international fund (located abroad) in which Russia could be the 
first to make contributions. An invitation would then be 
extended to private foreign capital to follow this example. 
Interest in this business has also been expressed by the 
American firm Russel 20x20, which controls capital in the amount 
of $1 billion and has already established a similar fund in 
Poland, then in China. 
  Practice shows that foreign investors prefer right now to 
engage in risky business in Russia through Russian state 
structures--as being more reliable. But rumors to the effect 
that one of these is operating effectively (or the opposite) are 
spread extremely rapidly among conservative (at least when it 
comes to money) "Westerners." And it may seem strange to them 
that following the declaration on priority being given to 
investment cooperation in the January presidential edict on 
structure of the government, RAICD--in essence a ministry, was 
subject to transformation into a state institution under the 
roof of MFER [Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations]. While on 
7 February the prime minister officially agreed to transfer the 
entire investments unit to the competence of the Ministry of 
Economics. Insofar as the above-mentioned presidential edict was 
not repealed by anyone, however, MFER also continues to consider 
itself the "investments boss." In this regard, judging from the 
plans of this department (drawn up recently in the form of a 
draft governmental decree), the RAICD investments unit may 
dissolve within the framework of the relevant governmental 
ministry. It remains an open question to what extent this 
diminished status will conform to the declared state strategy of 
priority being given to investment policy.

<H5>  Data on Foreign Capital in Russia </H5>
  --As of 31 January 1994, 12,173 enterprises with foreign 
investments were recorded in the State Register. The greatest 
flow of capital is attributable to 1993. Three hundred 
ninety-seven enterprises were registered in January 1994. 
  --The most intensive activity in Russia is being manifested 
by countries of the West, including the "Big Seven," as well as 
states of the former CMEA and China. 
  --Among new trends in the organization of enterprises with 
foreign investments we see a growth in the number of structures 
having 100-percent foreign capital (this practice is especially 
pronounced among Chinese businessmen). In connection with the 
falling rate of the ruble, however, the amounts of authorized 
capital of such enterprises (in hard currency) are diminishing 
on the whole. 
  --The share of foreign investors in the authorized capital 
of 
joint enterprises since March 1992 comes to about $870 million. 
  --With respect to size of charter fund and in terms of 
percentage of the total number of joint enterprises, the 
predominating share are enterprises engaged in intermediary and 
consulting services, and in light industry production output and 
trade. Some 21 percent of enterprises are engaged in the 
development and introduction of new instrumentation and 
technical systems. 
  --Among the enterprises with 100-percent foreign capital, 
the 
majority are engaged in intermediary and consulting services, 
financial transactions, and export-import operations.

<F P=106> [Article by Yekaterina Kravchenko: "Russian Ministry of </F>
Finance Is in No Hurry To Offer Guarantees; Japanese Credits for 
Russian Plants"] 
  [Text] People are inclined to blame the scarcity of 
large Japanese investment projects in the Russian market on the 
economic and political instability in Russia, predicting the 
absence of these projects in the future as well, but the 
contract Japan's Nissho Iwai firm signed with two Russian plants 
at the end of 1993 challenges this line of reasoning. This 
investment project will amount to around 150 million dollars. 
Although the Japanese side is fully prepared to take action on 
the agreements, it has encountered delays on the Russian side. 
This was the topic of discussion at yesterday's meeting of 
executives of the Japanese firms involved in the project. 
  The contract the Russian Tekhnopromimport Association 
(representing the interests of the Orsk Mechanical Plant and the 
Krasnoyarsk Refrigerator Plant) signed with a Japanese 
consortium (the Nissho Iwai, Sanyo Electric, and Toyo 
Engineering firms) for the delivery of Japanese technological 
lines for refrigerator compressor production was negotiated back 
in 1990. After the breakup of the Union, however, the Japanese 
government lines of credit for the financing of this contract 
were frozen. Talks on the resumption of the deliveries were held 
regularly after that, but the absence of Russian guarantees of 
the repayment of the credit from the Japanese Export-Import Bank 
was the main obstacle. It was not until 1993 that an agreement 
was concluded by the Export-Import Bank and Russian Foreign 
Economic Bank on the resumption of operations with lines of 
credit for the Orsk and Krasnoyarsk contracts. 
  According to the terms of the new contract concluded in 
December (for a total of around 150 million dollars), the 
Japanese side promised to deliver and install the technological 
equipment and train Russian personnel. The credits would be 
repaid in installments over a period of 8.5 years, starting in 
November 1995. The Japanese are ready to start acting on the 
agreements, but now the situation has been complicated by the 
procrastination of the Russian Ministry of Finance, which still 
has not provided the Japanese Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry with government guarantees for the credits. 
  According to observers, the Ministry of Finance's 
temporizing 
might be due to the general mood in government. When First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets, Central Bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko, and Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin met 
representatives of the Japanese Export-Import Bank and Mitsui 
Corporation in early February, it was clear that the Russian 
administrators were not eager to accept any government-backed 
credits. The "no-strings" preferential credit of 2 billion 
dollars from the U.S. Eximbank for the Russian petroleum 
industry was cited as a positive example at that meeting 
(although the possibility of obtaining this credit and of 
repaying it seems quite dubious--see KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 3 March). 
  In contrast to the American billions, which would be 
guaranteed by Russian oil, the Japanese credit presupposes 
repayment from the foreign currency proceeds of profitable 
enterprises. The Krasnoyarsk plant, for example, is already 
exporting its products successfully, and the Orsk plant even has 
a direct relationship to the military-industrial complex and to 
the budget allocations for conversion. The simple credit and 
repayment plan proposed by the Japanese and the low rate of 
interest (5 percent per annum) in comparison with the American 
rate are completely in line with government programs for the 
support of machine-building exports and the enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex. The behavior of the Ministry of 
Finance, however, could discourage the already cautious Japanese 
from investing in the Russian economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Artem Kudinov: "American Military Electronics in </F>
the Service of Siberians; a Satellite Communications Joint 
Venture Has Been Formed in Siberia"] 
  [Text] The work on the massive SibNet 
telecommunications project has begun in Siberia. Specialists 
believe that SibNet will institute superior computerized 
communications within the Russia-U.S.-China triangle through the 
American Intelsat communications satellite. Yesterday the chief 
executors of the project--Datron Systems, Inc., an American 
company; Gorizont, a scientific and technical firm in 
Shushenskoye (Krasnoyarsk Kray); and several Siberian 
communications enterprises--announced the formation of a joint 
venture to establish the satellite communications system in 
Siberia. The articles of incorporation had been signed the day 
before. The cost of the first phase of the project has been 
estimated at 2.5 million dollars. 
  The involvement of American firms--Pentagon contractors--in 
the work on technological projects in Russia apparently has 
already become a standard of performance. In any case, in a 
conversation with the KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Chairman 
Sergey Yemelyanov of the Telecommunications Coordinating Council 
of the Sibirskoye Soglasheniye Interregional Association did not 
neglect to underscore the prestige of the Datron Company (the 
supplier of the electronic equipment which proved to be so 
dependable in Operation "Desert Storm" in the Persian Gulf) and 
the firm's 25 years of experience working for the U.S. military 
establishment. 
  The participation of local investors and producers is also 
becoming an essential condition of large communications projects 
in Russia. According to this plan, for example, the station 
transmitting the coded data through the Russian Gorizont 
satellite will be equipped with antennae made in Russia with 
Russian technology. The only American components will be the 
electronic equipment of the five stations that are to be located 
in the Siberian mountains and one station in the Far East, 
capable of transmitting data to Datron in the United States 
through Intelsat. 
  Mr. Yemelyanov promised that the installation and user fees 
of the SibNet communications system would be much lower than the 
Moscow rates for comparable systems. In the near future the new 
joint venture also plans to enter the world market, offering 
similar stations to consumers with a need for high-caliber 
communications. China's interest in participating in the SibNet 
project is a result, according to the council director, of the 
activities of Chinese firms in Siberia and the Far East, where 
telephone communications still leave much to be desired. That is 
why the possibility of opening a teleport in Singapore is now 
being discussed in earnest.

  [Text] As in the days of the Cold War, the subject of 
rockets is filled with lack of agreement. According to scanty 
information obtained by the REUTER news agency, the 
Russian-American joint enterprise Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energy 
International has concluded large-scale agreements on commercial 
launches of communications satellites with the European radio 
and television company Societe Europeenne des Satellites and a

cofounding firms of the joint enterprise confirmed signing of 
the agreements at a press conference in San Francisco (held 
during the night hours of Wednesday-Thursday, according to 
Moscow time), but the terms of the agreements remain secret for 
the time being. 
  According to the REUTER agency, the agreements specifically 
envisage several launches of the Proton launch vehicle (one 
launch of Proton usually costs a foreign client $40 million-$60 
million). The first launch is scheduled to take place in 1995. 
  Today it is definitively clear that no participant in the 
world market of commercial space launches can ignore Russia's 
presence in this market. The aerospace joint enterprise 
Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energy International, established last year, 
presently controls about a third of this market, whose capacity 
amounts to $1.5 billion-$1.8 billion. The statements of the 
founders made at the press conference in San Francisco stood out 
for their confident, optimistic tone and confirmed the opinion 
of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts who last spring assessed the 
potential income of Russian aerospace firms at half a billion 
dollars (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY 7 April 1993). 
  "This is truly an outstanding achievement," stated Albert 
Smith, vice president of the space systems division of the major 
American corporation Lockheed, referring to the activity of the 
aerospace joint enterprise. Mr. Smith had every justification to 
make such a statement. As of today, the joint enterprise has 
already concluded contracts amounting to $600 million for the 
launch of communications satellites. True, the shares of 
participation of Lockheed, the State Space Scientific Production 
Center imeni M.V. Khrunichev (SSSPC), and the Energiya 
Scientific Production Association in the joint venture are not 
being divulged, but in any event Russia will not be a loser. 
SSSPC president Anatoliy Kiselev called the joint enterprise an 
example of mutually advantageous Russian-American cooperation 
and emphasized: "We are talking about the cooperation of equal 
partners." 
  This seizure of position on the world market is being 
secured 
for the partners primarily by the Proton launch vehicles, 
produced by the imeni Khrunichev plant. Mr. Kiselev reminded 
journalists that these rockets brought great benefits to the 
Soviet military-industrial complex in their time. Today SSSPC is 
using them to lift the commercial satellites of 
telecommunications and radio and television broadcasting 
companies into orbit. Specifically, Proton launch vehicles will 
be put into operation for the international project Iridium, 
valued at $4 billion, whose chief investor is the American 
telecommunications corporation Motorola. The Center imeni 
Khrunichev also has its own package of shares in this project. 
  An additional stimulus to the development of SSSPC is the 
January decree (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY 13 January) of the Russian 
Government, affording the center unprecedented rights in the 
establishment of the Russian state space program and the right 
to conclude independent contracts on the use of the Proton 
launch vehicle to effect commercial launches of foreign 
satellites. Forcing out a number of competing Russian 
organizations (including Glavkosmos) as a result, the Center 
imeni Khrunichev now has a good opportunity to fight with its 
foreign competitors, the most famous of which are China's space 
department ("Long March" rockets) and the European consortium 
Ariane (Ariane-4 rockets). The Proton surpasses its competitors 
with respect to the "price/throw weight" criterion. In addition, 
one of the chief problems of Russian producers has begun to lose 
its topicality--the importing of Western high-technology 
satellites used to be restricted by COCOM [Coordinating 
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls] prohibitions. For 
Russian firms it is extremely important that protectionism be 
definitively relegated to the past and that the determination of 
launch quotas be "entrusted" to the free market.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin: "Export Quotas Are No Longer a </F>
Secret"] 
  [Text] The campaign for allotment of export quotas 
for 1994, as in former times, took place without publicity. 
Nevertheless, from confidential sources the KOMMERSANT editors 
obtained information on the volumes and structure of the 
allocated quotas. There were also a few sensations. Yesterday 
telegrams arrived at the Mintopenergo [Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy] and the Minekonomika [Ministry of Economics] from 
Bashkiriya and Komi, stating that these republics reject in 
favor of their producer enterprises the regional quotas set for 
them on the export of oil and petroleum products (Bashkiriya for 
the first quarter of 1994, and Komi--for the entire year). Up 
until now, no one has ever rejected quotas. 
<H8>  Quotas: Yesterday and Today </H8>
  The riddle of export quotas which, as we know, are hammered 
out by hook or by crook, consists of the fact that in the end 
they are never exhausted. 
  In 1993, the quotas on oil were utilized by 95.6 percent, on 
petroleum products--by 73 percent, on lumber--by 56 percent, on 
copper--by 70 percent, on nickel--by 97 percent, and on 
aluminum--by 90 percent. 
  The reasons are different in each case. However, the result 
is the same. Last year's results are explained not by the fact 
that the quotas allocated were too high, but by the fact that 
there was a change in the price relations on the Russian and 
world markets. Domestic prices increased, outstripping the 
relatively smooth reduction in the currency exchange rate of the 
ruble. However, world prices on such goods vitally important to 
Russia as oil and aluminum declined, and for other raw materials 
goods they stagnated. The price gap, which determines the 
effectiveness of export, was narrowed. Russian exporters had 
already recovered from the gold fever. 
  The reduction in the volume of quotas for 1994 as compared 
with last year is a reaction to the reduction in effectiveness 
of export and pressure by the EC [European Community], which has 
16 "anti-dumping cases" pending against Russian exporters (on 
aluminum, a number of other metals, and fertilizers). The 
tightening of state control over export, however, is a poor 
substitute for support of exporters. 
<H8>  Quotas, Desired and Not Overly So </H8>
  The basic raw material flows of Russian export are, as 
before, controlled by administrative ties: 
Quotas--licenses--special exporters. However, individual 
segments in this system have been weakened. The regions 
traditionally do not not suit special exporters as an instrument 
of centralized control over the effectiveness of export. The 
innovation of 1994 consists of the fact that, first of all, the 
already effective currency control, strictly speaking, makes 
this administrative institution unnecessary. Secondly, the 
demarche of Bashkiriya and Komi clearly shows that within the 
family of export quotas, regional quotas are the most 
unprofitable. 
  Export credited toward state quotas is exempted from customs 
duties. As practical experience shows, the receipt of customs 
privileges by enterprises producing export products, especially 
if currency is used for the production needs, is much more 
realistic than the resolution of this same problem by the 
region. Thus, it is quite justified to assume that the regions 
will ever more actively strive toward achieving changes in the 
regulation of export. 
<H8>  Quotas From the Right, Tariffs From the Left </H8>
  Despite the unfavorable price conditions for exporters on 
the 
domestic and world markets, last year's positive foreign trade 
balance ($16 billion) was obtained primarily due to an increase 
in the absolute volumes of export of basic raw material goods. 
  In 1993, Russia exported 79.7 million tonnes of crude oil 
beyond the boundaries of the former USSR. This is 20.4 percent 
more than in 1992. The volume of currency revenues comprised 
$8.2 million and $8.5 million respectively. In other words, in a 
year it declined by 4 percent. 
  The export of petroleum products in 1993 totalled 34.5 
million tonnes, or $3.4 billion. In 1992 it was 25.3 million 
tonnes, or $4.2 billion. The physical volume increased by 36 
percent, while the cost volume declined by 17.4 percent. 
  The export of gas in 1993 was 96 billion cubic meters, or 
$7.2 billion worth. In 1992 it was 88 billion cubic meters, or 
$7.5 billion. The physical volume increased by 9 percent, while 
the cost volume declined by 3.4 percent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Level for 1993 - 100| 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In 1994 the volumes of quotas on key goods, despite 
tradition, may be fully utilized according to their designation. 
For now, in any case, this tendency is clearly apparent. The 
grounds for this have appeared: World prices on oil and aluminum 
have begun to move upward, and the drop in the exchange rate of 
the ruble has notably accelerated. In January-February, 38 
percent more petroleum products (in physical volume) were 
exported than last year. The increase is partly explained in a 
purely technical manner--by the carryover of deliveries from 
last year. Nevertheless, the general picture is paradoxical: The 
quotas are being reduced, while export is growing. The 
explanation is simple. The volumes of quotas which have been 
coordinated for the present day are clearly not final. 
Corrections will be introduced due to the most varied 
factors--sectorial lobbying, anti-dumping limitations on the 
part of the Western countries, and sharp changes in market 
conditions on the domestic as well as on the world markets. 
However, the irrevocable fact remains that the stake, as before, 
is being placed on raw material export. 
  For its effectiveness, especially under unfavorable price 
components, the level of customs rates is critically important. 
A new tariff has been introduced as of 1 November of last year. 
Its rates are significantly lower, but nevertheless raw material 
export is subject to duty payments. It would be logical to 
remove export customs duties altogether. Yet for now each 
exporter solves this problem to his own fear and risk. The most 
popular is the export of raw material "on a customer-supplied 
basis." It was specifically this type of oil deals with 
Lithuania that cost "LUKoil" its status as a special exporter. 
There are also more trivial variants associated with this same 
Lithuania: According to the data of the GTK [state customs 
control], 70 percent of the crude oil delivered to Kaliningrad 
Oblast is "lost" en route.

<H8>  Who Will Upgrade Russian Export? </H8>
  The strategic resolution of the problems of Russian export 
is 
inseparable from the change of its structure. For the time 
being, state support for upgrading export is expressed only in 
the absence of export duties on finished products and in 
instituting the Russian Eximbank [Export-Import Bank] which, 
however, will be able to begin ruble crediting of producers of 
industrial export products no sooner than this summer. Moreover, 
the structural changes must begin with increasing the degree of 
processing of initial raw material. In this sense, the theme of 
changing the structure of Russian export is directly tied with 
quota setting. We are speaking primarily of the status of 
foreign investors who, having invested funds into mining 
sectors, may realistically, starting with more intensive 
processing of raw material, build bridges also to the specific 
processing sectors. 
  For now, however, the vulnerability of foreign investors is 
not declining, but on the contrary, increasing. The procedure 
which was ratified by the government for defining specific 
production of SP [joint ventures] makes it possible for them to 
export their own products without obtaining quotas and licenses. 
However, it does not exempt them from having to register with 
the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] as special 
exporters, and this is rather complicated. The MVES guards the 
interests of Russian exporters, protecting them from foreign 
competitors. Thus, foreign investors are in solidarity with the 
Russian regions in their desire to eliminate special exporters 
"as a class." On the other hand, the hopes placed by foreign 
investors on the Russian Agency for International Cooperation 
and Development (RAMSIR) as the official lobbyist for their 
interests are most likely unfounded. In the course of the latest 
reshuffling within the government, RAMSIR was official handed 
over to the management of the MVES. However, the new patron 
clearly has no burning desire to deal seriously with foreign 
investors. As a result, the agency in fact is in a stage of 
division between the MVES and the Ministry of Economics. This, 
clearly, does not benefit either foreign investors, or, 
ultimately, the cause of improving the structure of Russian 
export.

  Many months of coordinating rates ended in victory primarily 
for the Russian agrarians and machine builders. Importers of 
food products suffered the most, since up until recently a large 
part of these goods had been imported duty-free. Now the amount 
of import duties on a number of goods in this group will 
comprise an average of 10-15 percent of the customs value. 
Specifically, meat and meat products, fish, butter and vegetable 
oil, milk and dairy products, fresh fruits and vegetables, white 
sugar, grain and products made from it have been placed in the 
category of food products which are subject to payment of duty. 
Despite the fact that for individual types of food products, 
sausage goods for example, the amount of duty has been increased 
to 20 percent, in the opinion of the primary suppliers of these 
types of goods to the Russian market, it is unlikely that there 
will be a significant change in the level of their wholesale 
prices in the near future. First of all, everyone was ready for 
the introduction of the new import tariff, and therefore the 
products were brought in ahead of time. Secondly, for now the 
regimen of preferences is being retained, as is the possibility 
of re-orienting our activity for delivery of a greater portion 
of products from countries which enjoy these preferences, i.e., 
from the developing countries and the least developed countries. 
  The rates of import duty on the long-suffering alcoholic 
beverages have been subject to significant changes. Added to the 
recently increased excise tax rates were also increased import 
duty rates. As for the rates themselves, evidently heeding the 
repeatedly expressed wishes of domestic producers, the rate of 
tariff on the import of alcohol will be fixed to the "literage." 
For example, while on hard liquor (TN VED code 2208) the duty 
will now comprise 2 EKYu for 1 liter, on ethyl alcohol 
(220710000)--although the rate of tariff is set in percent of 
the customs value--after final computation of the amount of 
payment it should be correlated with the established 2 EKYu for 
1 liter. 
  Undoubtedly, tariff determined in this manner excludes the 
possibility of excessive underestimation of the contract value 
(the favorite and easiest method of minimizing customs 
payments). However, we must note that the representatives of the 
domestic alcohol industry did not count on the setting of such 
high duties for analogous import products. According to their 
computations, the optimal duty rate for the import of alcoholic 
beverages is approximately $1.5 for 1 liter. If this amount is 
exceeded, the importers will be tempted to re-orient themselves 
toward contraband import. However, prior to the arrival of the 
designated time, direct importers of alcoholic beverages, just 
as the importers of food products, had prepared a unique buffer 
in order to smoothe the inevitable leap in wholesale and retail 
prices: Today there are enough goods stored up in the warehouses 
to ensure a "smooth price increase." 
  From the standpoint of the principle of defending the 
interests of domestic producers, perhaps the most effective have 
proven to be the innovations relating to the import of 
automobiles. The recent increase in excise taxes on the import 
of foreign makes has already yielded a "positive effect." With 
the increased cost of foreign models, not only did their import 
begin to decline, but consumers began to exhibit increased 
interest in domestic-made automobiles. This sets new tasks for 
their dealers. As for the owners of automobile dealerships, in 
their opinion, under the new conditions the main part of the 
income will now come from servicing the rather large pool of 
foreign made cars which already exists in Russia and selling 
spare parts for them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Kruglikov, first deputy chairman of </F>
State Customs Committee, by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent; 
date and place not given: "Underwater Tariff Reefs"] 
  [Text] The anticipation of new customs duties at the 
beginning of the year led to a buying frenzy in the Russian 
market. In spite of the considerable rise in the cost of 
imported goods, they did not remain on store shelves for long. 
Can we expect more stringent import controls and a new round of 
price increases this year? First Deputy Chairman Valeriy 
Kruglikov of the State Customs Committee answered the questions 
of a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] According to many domestic and Western 
businessmen, the customs tariff system is one of the most 
unstable sectors of the Russian economy. What is the reason for 
this? 
  [Kruglikov] Customs tariffs have to be viewed from several 
vantage points. Export duties are calculated, for example, with 
a view to world prices and the cost of goods in the domestic 
market. Whereas world prices are more or less constant, domestic 
prices are always rising. The prices of some goods were 
compounded dozens of times over the last year. For this reason, 
if we were to set permanent export duties, we would be creating 
a genuine pitfall that could stop all exports. That is why the 
amounts were changed several times last year: New rates were set 
twice, and the Customs Committee, the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations, the Ministry of Economics, and the Ministry 
of Finance were authorized to review the rates whenever 
necessary. This is only a temporary phenomenon, however. As we 
know, there are no export duties in other countries. According 
to the Law on Tariffs, we will not have them either after 1 
January 1996. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Could higher import duties compensate 
for 
this reduction of revenue? 
  [Kruglikov] Imports are a different matter. We have gone 
through several stages in our customs policy. At first, there 
were no import duties in Russia for half a year. This was done 
on the assumption that it would help us fill the Russian market 
with foreign goods, but this was an abnormal situation. The 
state has to conduct a protectionist policy to defend its own 
producers and to regulate the excess income that might result 
from differences between domestic and world prices. 
  Besides this, customs duties are one way of keeping Russia 
from becoming an appendage of Europe. After all, goods which 
cannot be sold in the developed countries are now being brought 
here. Unless we have barriers to block these shipments, our 
producers will be unprotected. This was the reason for the 
decision to institute a single tariff for all types of goods--5 
percent. Later it was raised to 15 percent, and after that we 
began setting different rates for different types of goods. Last 
year's import tariffs set a specific rate for each type of 
commodity. Now we are working on a new draft. We expected it to 
be approved by the beginning of the year, but we are still 
working on it. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Judging by the draft, import tariffs 
will 
rise considerably. Is this the result of lobbying by Russian 
industrial groups? 
  [Kruglikov] The tariff has to balance the interests of the 
dealer, the producers of goods within the country, and the 
state. Importers want to pay less. Producers want higher duties 
so that they will not have any competition. The state has to 
protect its own producers on the one hand while performing 
purely fiscal functions on the other, supplementing its own 
budget with customs duties. Some countries have been granted 
most-favored-nation status, and the rate on their exports is 
only half as high. 
  How can all of these interests be balanced? We suggested the 
creation of a governmental customs tariff council, representing 
all of these different parties in discussions of state policy in 
this area, but our recommendation has not won any support yet. 
  Sectorial ministries and departments seem to be paying 
closer 
attention to the export tariff now. They have sensed its impact 
on the state of the economy. Above all, this applies to 
agriculture. Foreign competition sometimes precludes the sale of 
domestic agricultural products, and this is also something the 
Customs Committee has to consider. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] How closely do the tariffs you are 
working on now correspond to the common standards of world 
trade, and will they evoke objections from our trade partners? 
  [Kruglikov] As you know, Russia has applied for membership 
in 
the GATT. That is why we are taking all of the requirements of 
that international organization into consideration, but it would 
be inappropriate to compare our tariff rates to the present 
rates in the European Community. The present situation in Russia 
precludes the institution of universal rates that are acceptable 
today and will still be acceptable six months from now. Our 
tariff policy has to be flexible and has to be adjusted 
periodically with a view to the state of the market, the supply 
of goods, the interests of producers, and many other factors. If 
the rate is to be raised, we will have to warn exporters in 
advance, so that we will not upset their plans. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] It is no secret that the mechanism of 
customs import and export declarations is still far from 
perfect. What is the State Customs Committee doing to improve it? 
  [Kruglikov] Several important documents have been approved 
or 
are being drafted at this time. Much of the procedure for 
declaring customs value has been borrowed from world practice. 
After all, exporters frequently understate the value of their 
goods, and the state incurs substantial losses as a result. We 
also plan to institute an extremely compact system of currency 
control. It will apply to exports of raw materials at first, 
then to all exports, and then to imports as well. The latest 
electronic equipment will be used in this process. 
  We plan to institute stricter declaration controls, 
especially for goods subject to excise taxes. This is the most 
difficult thing we have had to do thus far. Russia's borders are 
still open. Unscrupulous importers are taking advantage of this 
to ship goods subject to excise tax through the territory of the 
CIS republics without paying any money to the treasury. That is 
why we have to change the procedure for the declaration of goods 
subject to excise taxes, including the rules of re-exports, 
re-imports, and transit shipments.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin: "The State Customs Committee Is </F>
Setting Up a Fund as Part of the Federal Budget; the Customs 
Service Will Be Self-Financed"] 
  [Text] The customs service has the most clearly 
defined--on the level of federal law--operating base of all the 
Russian agencies. The customs code specifically envisages the 
creation of a special self-financing fund. In accordance with 
this, a statute on the extra-budgetary fund for the development 
of the Russian customs system was drafted, was approved by a 
government decree, and was officially circulated yesterday. 
  The customs code created a new niche for Russian business 
developing under the patronage of the State Customs Committee. 
Of course, the customs service is not in dire straits. It 
collects fees for licenses authorizing the use of a particular 
customs procedure (for opening a customs or free warehouse, for 
example) or qualifying certificates (particularly those granting 
the right to act as a customs broker). The inclusion of credit 
institutions guaranteeing the payment of customs fees in the 
register also costs the banks a certain amount. Now these 
payments, along with the traditional customs fees, the proceeds 
from the sale of confiscated contraband and of property used as 
security deposits, fines and other penalties, will be used to 
set up a fund for the development of the customs system. 
  The fund is called extra-budgetary, but the approved statute 
defines its resources as federal property and as part of the 
federal budget. At the same time, the fund will be managed and 
administered by the State Customs Committee and will not be 
subject to expropriation. There is an obvious contradiction 
here. It is clear that proceeds from the customs business will 
be budget revenue. As for the use of these proceeds, however, 
although the procedure for allocating budget resources for other 
than their designated purpose is extremely complicated, it would 
be wrong to completely exclude the possibility of a situation in 
which the Ministry of Finance might shock the customs service 
with the news that all of its money is gone. In short, the 
extra-budgetary status of the customs fund is extremely 
conditional. Only one thing is absolutely clear: The money in 
the fund will not be subject to capitalization, distinguishing 
it from a pension fund. Therefore, although the fund is certain 
to improve the life of customs service personnel, the use of 
this money will be subject to definite limits and could be 
opposed by the Ministry of Finance. 
  [Box] 
<H5>  The Customs Service Plans To Use the Fund for the Following </H5>
Purposes: 
  --to combat crime in the customs sphere; 
  --to improve customs control and the customs registration of 
freight shipments; 
  --to establish currency control and strategic export 
control; 
  --to keep customs statistics; 
  --to provide state agencies, enterprises, and citizens with 
information about customs procedures; 
  --to strengthen the material and technical base and develop 
the social sphere of the customs system; 
  --to build and renovate vehicle checkpoints on the border; 
  --to build customs warehouses, temporary storage facilities, 
and other structures; 
  --to finance measures connected with the financial and 
personal security and social protection of customs service 
personnel "in areas not covered by budget financing"; 
  --to maintain the scientific research institutions of the 
State Customs Committee; 
  --to finance enterprises of the customs system whose 
operations will supplement the fund; 
  --to supplement resources for the financial incentives and 
sociocultural measures of customs agencies (no more than 75 
percent of total wages).

  [Signed] V.F. Kruglikov, First Deputy Chairman of the 
Russian 
Federation State Customs Committee 
<H5>  Statute on Customs Procedure for Re-Imports </H5>
  1. General Provisions 
  1.1. The re-import of goods is a customs procedure in which 
Russian goods which are taken out of the customs territory of 
the Russian Federation in accordance with the export customs 
procedure are then brought back into this territory within the 
deadline set by this statute without the collection of customs 
duties, value-added tax, or excise taxes, and without the 
application of economic policy restrictions (quotas, licenses, 
etc.). 
  1.2. Foreign goods may not qualify for re-import status, and 
neither may Russian goods exported from the customs territory of 
the Russian Federation in line with other customs procedures 
(requisitions for temporary use, requisitions for agencies 
representing the Russian Federation abroad, processing outside 
the customs territory, and transit shipments in the event of 
transferal through the territory of a foreign state). 
  The customs procedure for re-imports will not apply to goods 
prohibited for import to the Russian Federation and export from 
the Russian Federation. 
  2. Conditions of Qualification for Re-Import Status 
  2.1. To meet the requirements of the customs procedure for 
re-imports, the goods must satisfy the following conditions: 
  a) they must be goods which were taken out of the territory 
of the former USSR (prior to 31 December 1991) or out of the 
territory of the Russian Federation (starting on 1 January 1992) 
in accordance with the export procedure; 
  b) they must have been Russian goods until they were 
exported--i.e., goods of Russian origin (or originating in the 
former USSR prior to 31 December 1991) or goods of foreign 
origin which were freely circulated within the territory of the 
Russian Federation (or within the territory of the former USSR 
prior to 31 December 1991) after the full payment of all customs 
fees; 
  c) they must have been brought back into the customs 
territory of the Russian Federation within 10 years after the 
date of export. 
  The date of importation is the date of the acceptance of the 
last document required for customs purposes. 
  The time of export is the date of the acceptance of the 
customs export declaration or, in its absence, the date the 
goods crossed the border of the former USSR (prior to 31 
December 1991) or the border of the Russian Federation (starting 
on 1 January 1992); 
  d) they must be in the same state as at the time of export, 
with the exception of changes resulting from natural wear or 
shrinkage under normal conditions of shipping and storage and 
other cases stipulated in subsections 2.5 and 2.6 of this 
statute. 
  Natural wear or shrinkage and normal conditions of shipping 
and storage will be defined by standards and other legislative 
instruments in effect in the Russian Federation and pertaining 
to this category of goods. 
  2.2. The fact that the goods qualifying as re-imports are 
identical to the goods taken out of the country in line with the 
export procedure, the fact that they did leave the country, the 
date of export, and the fact that the goods are Russian are to 
be established (or confirmed) by a method deemed credible and 
legitimate by customs officials. Proving these facts will be the 
responsibility of the concerned party. 
  In the absence of a customs declaration, or if the date the 
goods crossed the border cannot be confirmed by a satisfactory 
method, the date of export of the goods of Russian origin (or of 
former USSR origin prior to 31 December 1991) will be the date 
of their manufacture (if only the month of manufacture is known, 
the date will be the first of that month, and if only the year 
is known, the date will be 1 January of that year). In the 
absence of documents listing the date of manufacture, an expert 
appraisal may be conducted. 
  2.3. The use of the goods for production or other commercial 
purposes outside the Russian Federation will not preclude the 
qualification of these goods as re-imports. 
  2.4. The application for re-import status may be submitted 
by 
any person, irrespective of the exporting party. 
  2.5. If the goods have been damaged or depreciated in some 
other sense as a result of an accident or circumstances beyond 
human control, these goods may be qualified as re-imports on the 
condition that the occurrence of the accident or circumstances 
can be confirmed by a method deemed credible and legitimate by 
customs officials. 
  2.6. The goods may have undergone maintenance operations, 
minor repairs, including adjustments, and other such operations 
while they were outside the Russian Federation on the condition 
that the declared value of these goods at the time of export was 
not increased as a result of these operations. 
  The relationship between value at the time of export and 
value at the time of importation will be calculated on the basis 
of the U.S. dollar. If prices in contracts or other documents 
are listed in other currencies, the calculations will be based 
on the exchange rate of these currencies in relation to the U.S. 
dollar at the time of export or import. 
  3. Collection of Customs Duties, Taxes, and Other Fees 
and Payments 
  3.1. If the goods are re-imported within three years of the 
time of export, the customs agency will refund the export duties 
and export taxes paid. 
  3.2. They will be refunded on the following conditions: 
  --if the goods were exported and imported by the same person 
who paid the export duties or export taxes or on whose behalf 
the payments were made; 
  --if the customs agency is presented with a copy of the 
customs declaration used as the basis for the calculation and 
payment of export duties or export taxes and written 
confirmation from the customs agency to which the payments were 
made or from its successor in interest on the actual deposit of 
the fees in the account of the customs agency or directly in the 
budget. The written confirmation must meet the requirements of 
financial documents; 
  --if the export tax was paid to customs agencies located 
within the territory of the Russian Federation; 
  --if the person mentioned in the second paragraph of this 
subsection submits a written request for a refund of the sums 
paid to the customs agency. This request may be written in any 
format. The request for a refund must be submitted to the 
customs agency within one year after the date of acceptance of 
the customs declaration qualifying the goods as re-imports. 
  If even one of these conditions is not met, the paid sums of 
export duties and export taxes will not be refunded. 
  3.3. Only the paid sum of customs duties and export taxes 
will be refundable. 
  Penalties, overdue fines, and other such payments will not 
be 
refundable. 
  The refunded sums will not be adjusted for inflation, and no 
interest will be paid on these sums. 
  The refund will be made in the currency of the Russian 
Federation, irrespective of the currency in which the customs 
duties and export taxes were paid. If the payment was made in a 
foreign currency with an exchange rate quoted by the Central 
Bank of the Russian Federation, conversion into the currency of 
the Russian Federation will be based on the Russian Federation 
Central Bank exchange rate on the date of acceptance of the 
customs declaration claiming re-import status. If the payment 
was made in another foreign currency, its conversion to rubles 
will be based on the rate of exchange on the payment date. 
  3.4. Refunds will be the responsibility of the customs 
agency 
registering the goods qualifying as re-imports. 
  3.5. When part of a shipment of exported goods is to be 
qualified as re-imports, the refund amount will be based on the 
quantitative relationship of this part to the whole shipment of 
exported goods. 
  3.6. The customs official making the refund will note the 
return of the paid sums, including partial refunds, on the copy 
of the export declaration submitted by the person, and on the 
confirmation mentioned in Subsection 3.2. of this statute, by 
filling in the amount of the refund (in numbers and words) and 
the date of the refund. The notation will be endorsed by the 
official's signature and personal number stamp. 
  A copy of the confirmation noting the refund will be sent to 
the customs agency issuing the confirmation. This copy will be 
kept with the customs agency's copy of the customs declaration 
qualifying the goods as exports. 
  3.7. Import duties will not be collected on re-imported 
goods 
when they enter the customs territory of the Russian Federation. 
  3.8. In the case of re-imports which were exported from the 
territory of the Russian Federation after 1 January 1992, the 
person making the declaration will pay the customs agency the 
value-added tax which was refunded at the time of export or from 
which the goods were exempt at the time of export. 
  The amount subject to payment will be calculated according 
to 
the rates in effect at the time the goods entered the country. 
  The basis for calculating the payment amount will depend on 
the date of acceptance of the customs declaration qualifying the 
goods as re-imports. 
  The value-added tax privileges granted solely for goods 
brought into the customs territory of the Russian Federation 
will not apply. 
  3.9. At the time of the re-import of goods exported from the 
territory of the Russian Federation after 1 January 1992, the 
person making the declaration will pay excise taxes at the rates 
that were in effect at the time of export for goods produced in 
the Russian Federation. 
  The customs value used in the calculation of payment amounts 
will be determined on the date of acceptance of the customs 
declaration qualifying the goods as re-imports. 
  4. Customs Registration of Goods Qualifying as 
Re-Imports 
  4.1. The customs registration of re-imported goods will be 
conducted in the customs agency whose zone of operations 
includes the location of the consignee or a structural 
subdivision of the consignee. 
  4.2. When the goods are to be qualified as re-imports, the 
person making the declaration will submit the following 
documents to the customs agency: 
  --a customs freight declaration filled out in accordance 
with 
the addendum to this statute; 
  --authorization from other state agencies if the re-imported 
goods are subject to control by these agencies;

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Zavarskiy and Yevgeniy Ostapov, under the </F>
"Plans of Cessna Aircraft for Russia" rubric: "The American 
Debut Will Hardly Draw a Full House"] 
  [Text] A market for business jets [here and 
henceforth rendered in English in the original]--small jet 
planes which amount simultaneously to a flying office and 
recreation room (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 5 February)--which has 
evolved in Russia has prompted a fit of activity on the part of 
Western producers of such aircraft. The American company Cessna 
Aircraft, which is holding a presale traveling show of its 
latest business jet, the Citation VII, even resolved to make an 
unplanned stop in Russia. However, the Russian debut of the 
company--a two-day presentation of the plane, which ended 
yesterday--indicated that the feverish haste in the hope of 
getting the Russian market does not guarantee success in and of 
itself. 
  Cessna Aircraft was founded in December 1927. The 
headquarters of the company is located in the city of Wichita 
(Texas) [as published]. The company produces small propeller and 
jet planes. During its existence, it has produced about 20,000 
planes (it sells up to 110 jet planes annually). The A-37 light 
ground-attack jet plane is one of its best-known models. 
Recently, the company has been involved in manufacturing 
business jets, which have a 60-percent share on the American 
aviation market. 
  Unscheduled travel by air that is more comfortable than in 
first class and has long been popular among the Russian captains 
of industry and is becoming increasingly popular among major 
private businessmen calls for adequate equipment. However, 
Cessna has hardly selected the best site for its first 
appearance in Russia: The State Scientific-Research Institute of 
Civil Aviation is located almost 40 kilometers away from Moscow. 
The Americans ended up quite a "distance" from their main 
competitors in Russia--the French Dassault Aviation and British 
Aerospace, whose Falcon-900 and BAe-125 planes have already 
received Russian airworthiness certificates. Besides, the cabin 
of the Citation VII model has smaller dimensions than the 
competing planes and is therefore less comfortable. Also, the 
range of the British and French planes is almost twice as long 
(see the box), which is important under Russian conditions. This 
is why the success of Cessna on the Russian market is uncertain. 
  The market itself looks quite interesting at present. 
Neither 
the old obstacles to the flights of business jets nor the 
restrictions on passengers to be carried exist anymore. The 
issue is how to take advantage of existing opportunities. Any 
Russian businessman who has the necessary funds may now acquire 
a business jet for personal use. However, its cost as a rule 
exceeds $10 million, and one hour of flight costs almost $1,000. 
Only the largest companies--Ford, GM, or Fiat--or eccentric 
zillionaires such as Armand Hammer or Robert [as published] von 
Karajan (the latter prefers to sit at the controls himself) have 
their own planes of this class in the West. Businessmen usually 
charter a plane from a small company engaging in the unscheduled 
carriage of VIP's. About 40 such companies already exist in the 
CIS, and all sufficiently large airports are able to receive 
business jets (four or five of them land at Sheremetyevo-2 every 
day). 
  As far as prospects for the acquisition of Western business 
jets are concerned, under the new customs tariff introduced on 
15 March, the purchase will cost 50 percent more (at present, 
this problem concerns, for example, the head of the AvtoVAZ 
[Volga Automotive Plant], Vladimir Kadanikov, who has only a 
refurbished YaK-40 at his disposal). Leasing is likely to appear 
preferable from now on. 
  [Begin boxed item] 
<H5>  Planes of the Business Jet Class in Russia </H5>
  About 20 Falcon-900's (eight to 14 passengers, takeoff 
weight 
29 tonnes, cabin dimensions 11.9 by 2.34 by 1.87 meters, range 
7,400 kilometers) and BAe-125-800's (eight passengers, 10 
tonnes, 6.5 by 1.85 by 1.85 meters, 5,600 kilometers) which were 
certified last year in keeping with Russian airworthiness norms 
have already been purchased in the CIS. Private and state 
companies (the Gazprom purchased one Falcon-900) and a few 
airlines were the buyers. 
  The analogous characteristics of the Citation VII (see the 
picture) are six to eight passengers, 10 tonnes, 5.5 by 1.7 by 
1.7 meters, 4,200 kilometers. The base price is $8 million-$10 
million, which is approximately 30 percent below the prices of 
the competition. 
  More than 100 planes (mostly the YaK-40 and the Tu-134) have 
been converted into business jets in Russia. At present, there 
are no obstacles to operating Russian or foreign equipment of 
this class; however, a lengthy and inconvenient procedure exists 
for obtaining flight licenses. The adoption of relevant 
legislative documents is expected this year.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Sokolov: "The Perverse Fate of the </F>
`Russian Document'"] 
  [Text] What else will the archives of the CPSU 
Central Committee reveal and to what extent can they be 
believed? 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has finally lifted the embargo 
on 
trade with Vietnam that has been in existence for three decades. 
But the question of the fate of the American prisoners of war 
and those missing in action during the years of war in Indochina 
continues to be a stumbling block in bilateral relations between 
the United States and Vietnam. This problem was aggravated 
especially after Harvard University Professor Steven Morris 
discovered in the archives of the CPSU Central Committee the 
so-called "Russian document"--a translation of a report of the 
North Vietnamese General Tran Van Quang that he allegedly 
presented on 15 September 1972 at a meeting of the Politburo of 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. It 
followed from the document that by that time 1,205 U.S. military 
servicemen were being held captive. A year and a half later 
Vietnam repatriated 591 Americans and announced that the 
question of U.S. prisoners of war was closed. The significant 
discrepancy in the figures constituted the essence of a scandal: 
They said that Vietnam was "hiding" more than 600 Americans. The 
U.S. mass media began to make the most diverse assumptions 
regarding their possible fate, right down to the "Katyn 
scenario." 
  Soon, at the beginning of September 1993, the subject of the 
Americans missing in action arose again in connection with the 
appearance of the so-called "second Russian dossier." 
Representatives of the Russian section in conjunction with the 
U.S.-Russian Joint Commission for POW's/MIA's during and after 
World War II (SARK) turned over to their American colleagues 
documents from Soviet military intelligence, according to which 
there were 735 American pilots in North Vietnam at the beginning 
of the 1970's, and not 386 as Hanoi had informed the United 
States previously. 
  The public perceived both events as a sensation. But any 
sensation has a reverse side--doubts about the reliability of 
whatever caused the stir. But here too certain circumstances put 
a person on guard. 
  Materials which, according to the rules of domestic 
archives, 
were in the category of top secret were made available to 
Professor Steven Morris. Moreover, he was given the entire case, 
while existing rules allow giving an investigator only a copy of 
the document that interests him. Why? Let us take the liberty of 
referring to the newspaper SEGODNYA, which reported that 
Professor Morris had gained access to the archives of the former 
CPSU Central Committee because of a certain list which included 
his name among the few that were marked by a red pencil. It is 
not known who made these pencil marks. 
  The appearance of the "second Russian dossier" coincided in 
time with the forthcoming trip of the defense minister of Russia 
to the United States. This, incidentally, was not the first case 
when the appearance of documents from the Russian archives 
"happened" to coincide with visits from political figures. 
<H5>  General Quang Denies Everything </H5>
  Immediately after Steven Morris's findings were made public, 
a special emissary from the U.S. President, retired General John 
Vessey, flew to Hanoi. There he met with the 76-year-old retired 
General Tran Van Quang, who is now in charge of the Union of 
Vietnamese Veterans of War. Tran Van Quang flatly denied 
participating in the report found in Moscow and stated that he 
had never dealt with American POW's. And Vietnamese officials 
not only denied the information contained in the report but even 
gave to understand that such a document could not have been 
obtained by the Soviets at all. 
  Here the following circumstances should be taken into 
account: In the report General Quang was named as the deputy 
chief of the general staff of the Vietnamese People's Army, but 
in September 1972 he was in command of one of the fronts in 
Central Vietnam. And he held the post of deputy chief of the 
general staff later, from 1974 through 1978. In 1972 he did not 
go to Hanoi at all. Moreover, during the war, because of the 
rules that existed at the time, Tran Van Quang never used his 
real name. Right up until 1975 he was known as Bai Tien, and 
even in party documents he was known by this pseudonym. 
  Further, according to the chain of command that existed, 
Tran 
Van Quang as the commander of the front could not submit direct 
reports to the Politburo. In the opinion of the extremely 
well-informed Vietnamese journalist Bui Tin, former deputy 
editor in chief of the party newspaper NHAN DAN, who is now 
living in France, "If such a document did exist, it would have 
to be signed by the chief of the GlavPUR [Main Political 
Administration], Colonel General Song Hao, or his deputy, 
Lieutenant General Le Quang Dao, but in no case by Major General 
Tran Van Quang." 
  Finally, the document speaks about a meeting of the 
Politburo 
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam of 15 
September 1972, while Vietnamese party archives do not 
corroborate this fact. 
  As a result, at the end of his mission to Hanoi John Vessey 
admitted that he had more doubts about the document's 
reliability than he had before the trip, and the information he 
received during the course of the visit "reinforced his opinion 
that our own (United States--ed.) information is more accurate 
than the information from the report found in Moscow." 
<H5>  Statistics `From the Desired' </H5>
  The discrepancy in the figures that arose after the 
appearance of the "secret report from General Quang" could, 
naturally, have been caused by ordinary "corrections" when the 
information of the Special Services was submitted by the higher 
leaders in the "proper form," taking their wishes and interests 
into account. 
  It is known, for example, that one American aircraft downed 
in Vietnam was accounted for in several places at the same time 
and sometimes in several different provinces. Therefore in the 
final total there was not one but several enemy aircraft downed. 
With statistics of this kind during the years of the Vietnam War 
they managed to down more aircraft of the U.S. Air Force than 
participated in combat action. The "high" results made it 
possible to promote North Vietnamese military servicemen and 
count on more aid, including military, from the USSR and other 
socialist countries. 
  From all appearances, such a "statistical" approach could be 
used with respect to American POW's too. For the Vietnamese, 
every captured American represented more than just political 
value. Because the United States was prepared to bear any 
material costs to gain the release of its compatriots. The more 
so since a living American would "cost" much more than his 
remains. 
  But still, the main thing is that war always means 
disturbance of the usual way of life, an absence of order in 
general, and therefore one can hardly speak of any kind of 
systematic statistics or accounting for enemy losses (both 
combat equipment and human forces) in Vietnam during those 
years. Let us recall that at the meeting of the then foreign 
affairs minister of Vietnam, Nguyen Co Thach, and John Vessey in 
Washington in 1990, the figures from both sides for American 
MIA's in the war in Indochina were given--1,700 and 2,300. The 
Vietnamese agreed to accept the Pentagon's statistics, 
explaining this by the fact that the United States had been 
forced to keep precise account of its losses. 
<H5>  Countries, Special Services, Interests... </H5>
  The solution to the problem of American POW's and MIA's in 
the Vietnamese War presupposes a mandatory accounting for 
Soviet-Vietnamese relations, which were not always the same, but 
they always felt the presence of another party--China. And the 
Chinese factor had an impact both on the rapprochement and on 
alienation in relations between the USSR and the Democratic 
Republic of Vietnam [DRV] in various stages of the war, 
especially when it came to the positions of the two countries 
regarding certain political issues. 
  According to certain witnesses, they were extremely 
unwilling 
to allow Soviet military specialists access to seized American 
equipment and frequently this access was granted only after the 
Chinese advisers in the DRV had familiarized themselves with it. 
And although the American POW's were of interest to the Soviet 
Special Services, the Hanoi authorities strictly monitored their 
Soviet friends, and if they allowed something it was only within 
certain limits. 
  From an interview with retired KGB General Oleg Kalugin 
published in the United States one can see that in 1978 Soviet 
state security workers interrogated three Americans who were 
supposed to be, as usual, in the hands of the Vietnamese and 
were included in the "group of several or 10 individuals" who 
remained or were detained in Vietnam after the repatriation. 
Regarding these statements, the Americans announced that they 
knew of only one American POW who remained in Vietnam but later 
returned to the United States. 
  The press service of foreign intelligence of Russia did not 
deny that the meeting with one American actually did occur. This 
conversation with the American flyer, who was suspected of being 
a member of the CIA, took place in January-February 1973, not in 
1978 as Oleg Kalugin asserted. The Vietnamese authorities, 
incidentally, soon informed the Soviets that the American had 
refused further contacts. 
  It is even more incredible that U.S. POW's were turned over 
to the Soviet Union. As the deputy foreign affairs minister of 
Vietnam, Nguyen Di Nien, stated, Moscow did not make such a 
demand. And Vietnam would not do this for very many reasons, 
including because of its unwillingness to worsen its relations 
with China. And not only because in the East the proverb "A 
close neighbor is better than a distant relative" has the force 
of law. It is simply that Vietnam has always tried to take into 
account to its own advantage the complex nature of relations 
between the USSR and the PRC. 
  One can assume that with respect to American POW's the 
Soviets too could speak only of a tactical interest, 
ways and means of waging battle, that is, information which 
could have been obtained from the flyers. But much more 
important was the strategic interest, the common 
goals of the war. The captured American pilots did not have this 
information, and the individuals who had it, naturally, did not 
fly in combat aircraft. 
  Therefore assertions about the possibility that Americans 
participating the Vietnamese War spent some time in the USSR are 
not convincing. The only thing that was possible was a 
transit through Moscow by Americans who had deserted 
from the army and were leaving Asia for Europe. That was the 
route, for example, of the Americans who went from Tokyo to 
Stockholm for the conference in defense of Vietnam. 
Incidentally, in the opinion of Robert Neel, White House deputy 
chief of staff who spent the summer of 1993 in Vietnam, many 
Americans who were thought to be missing in action were actually 
alive but had deserted from the army and were living in Thailand. 
<H5>  Who Is the Author of the `Russian Dossier' </H5>
  As we know, the Joint Commission confirmed the authenticity 
of the Russian version of the "secret report of General 
Kalugin," while at the same time admitting that there were 
certain mistakes in it. Of course, one should not intervene in 
the sphere of another's professional interests, but nonetheless 
it is the admission of these mistakes and other circumstances 
that make it possible to make certain assumptions. First, it was 
practically impossible for the Soviet workers to obtain 
information directly from such a fairly important military 
leader as Tran Van Quang. Any contacts between the Vietnamese 
and foreigners were difficult, and unsanctioned communication 
with representatives of other states (even friendly ones) could 
have the direst consequences for Vietnamese citizens. The 
communication that was permitted occurred within a strict 
framework and the authorities, naturally, were informed both 
about the meetings themselves and about their content. 
  Therefore even the report found by Steven Morris should 
apparently be regarded more as the result of a generalization of 
certain information obtained by Soviet Special Services from 
various sources. Intelligence gleans and gives form to 
information through closed channels without presenting it for 
public judgment. And if there are mistakes--and they also 
occur--nobody but the consumer knows about them. So the 
authorship of the "first Russian dossier" can also be regarded 
from the position reported by the former Soviet intelligence 
agent, Vladimir Kozhmekin, who admitted that both he and his 
colleagues, frequently, when they "dug up valuable and useful 
information by the method of analyzing information flows," 
ascribed it to a specific "source," a foreigner. 
<H5>  The `Vietnamese Syndrome' Lives </H5>
  It is known that in the United States there is a powerful 
lobby of public organizations and individual politicians who 
think that the Vietnamese are still concealing information about 
American POW's and are keeping them in Vietnam in secret camps 
and shelters in mountain regions with difficult access. Among 
those who spoke out against withdrawing the trade embargo on 
Vietnam were the Veterans of Foreign Wars (2.2 million members) 
and American Disabled War Veterans (1.2 million members), the 
National League of Families of American POW's and MIA's in 
Southeast Asia, the Republican Senator Robert Smith, the former 
POW Orson Sweeney, a close assistant to Ross Perot, and other 
politicians. 
  There is also a "Vietnamese point" in the biography of the 
American president--his evasion of the draft during the Vietnam 
War. Therefore in the question of POW's Bill Clinton has had to 
be more circumspect than his predecessors in the presidential 
office. He has had to demonstrate to Americans, especially those 
who are against any relaxation of the American position with 
respect to Vietnam, how important he considers military 
questions to be in the system of national tasks and values of 
the United States. And here he cannot but take into account the 
extremely large Vietnamese diaspora and the clearly expressed 
extremist tendencies inherent in it. 
  It is the Vietnamese immigrants, mainly from South Vietnam, 
who are most stubbornly insisting on positions of irreconcilable 
confrontation and political and economic pressure on Vietnam. 
And they are also very frequently involved in the disclosure of 
various sensational reports related to the "discovery" of new 
facts about American POW's in Vietnam. 
  All these circumstances make us take a new look at the very 
problem of Vietnamese-American relations. And then the question 
of the American MIA's in the war in Indochina appears to a 
considerable degree as a problem of political life within the 
United States. 
  Therefore it seems important to get rid of all the 
politicization, ideological cliches, and all kinds of 
exaggerations and understatements pertaining to all the work 
involved in searching for American MIA's. Because, for instance, 
according to the military historian V. Galitskiy, during the 
course of the work of the Joint Commission the Russians received 
from the Americans a list of 3,752 MIA's. Later it was learned 
that more than one-fourth of the names included on this list had 
returned home long ago after being held captive or other 
circumstances. It is difficult not to agree with Galitskiy when 
he says that the U.S. Special Services when investigating 
American MIA's were more interested in pursuing the goal of 
establishing the nature and results of the work of the Special 
Services of the former USSR in dealing with American POW's. 
Personal and professional ambitions of the corresponding 
departments and services are hardly appropriate when solving 
such a delicate problem. 
<H5>  American Wings for the Vietnamese Dragon </H5>
  Nonetheless, Clinton decided to lift the embargo. And most 
likely because Washington is well aware that the Vietnamese 
market offers broad potential for capital investments and trade. 
And this is especially important in the current economic 
situation where the United States could be deprived of certain 
commercial advantages if it is slow in establishing effective 
political relations with Vietnam. It seems that American 
businessmen are afraid that when they return to Vietnam there 
will be Japanese waiting for them there. Moreover, Vietnam is 
undoubtedly of a certain strategic interest for the United 
States if one takes into account the ambiguity of the 
aspirations of the PRC in the region of the South China Sea and 
the growing concern of the countries of the region in this 
regard. 
  As for Vietnam, it is trying to attract American business to 
the country because, among other things, it wants to counteract 
both China's growing political and economic might and Japan's 
trade influence. 
  Thus both the United States and Vietnam understand that the 
language of alienation is the language of the past. 
  Naturally, Bill Clinton understands all this and is taking 
it 
into account, and he himself has said repeatedly that he has an 
economic vision of the world, not a political one. The process 
of normalizing relations with Vietnam has actually begun, and it 
is proceeding in stages and is linked to the receipt of new 
confirmations from Hanoi concerning readiness to cooperate with 
the United States in solving the problem of the American MIA's.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Lapskiy: "We Will Have To Resign </F>
Ourselves to the Loss of the Amber Chamber, and the Treasure of 
Tsar Priam, Possibly, Will Be Returned to Germany"] 
  [Text] The assertion that Russia has nothing to 
return to Germany from among the cultural treasures taken from 
its territory during the war years does not correspond to the 
truth, said Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov at the first 
session of the joint Russian-German Commission. Russia is by no 
means obligated to return museum exhibits unilaterally, without 
receiving something in exchange. 
  FRG Minister of Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel, agreed: The 
return of cultural treasures is not a one-way street. In Russia 
it is hoped that Germany will take measures in regard to the 
search for and return of what was stolen during the time of the 
war. 
  There is no commmon opinion, for example, what to consider 
lost and illegally transferred. If the export of cultural 
treasures from Russia to Germany during the years of the war may 
be considered illegal, many German cultural treasures found in 
Russian depositories were exported legally, on the basis of 
decisions of an ally's administration. But, it goes without 
saying, there were many that were acquired as the result of 
robbery and looting. For this reason it is necessary to 
determine the legal status of every object that has turned up in 
Russia. 
  What objects are we talking about? Several months ago, the 
Russian Ministry of Culture acknowledged that the so-called 
Treasure of Tsar Priam, which was taken from the Berlin Museum 
during the last days of the war, lies in the store-rooms of the 
Moscow Museum imeni A. S. Pushkin and the St. Petersburg 
Hermitage. In the words of Sidorov, the treasures found by the 
German amateur archaeologist Schliemann in the place of the 
legendary Troy require expert opinions; then, possibly, they 
will be shown at an exhibition. Not long ago, approximately 
6,000 books of the famous Gotha Library were discovered in the 
library holdings of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The greater 
part of the collection of almost 330,000 volumes that had been 
taken to Moscow was returned in 1956 to its former place, to the 
castle Friedenstein in Gotha. Obviously, soon the remaining 
volumes will also be returned. Sidorov made a nice gesture--he 
handed Kinkel five 16th and 17th century folios from this 
library. 
  According to available data, in our country there are 2 of 
the 12 Gutenberg Bibles, more than 1,000 prints from the Bremen 
Art Gallery, and a collection of drawings by Duehrer removed 
from Germany. All in all, in Russia there are some 900,000 art 
objects and cultural artifacts that were taken from Germany. 
  It is much more complicated with valuables removed to 
Germany. Where are they, what about them? Tragic is the fate of 
the Amber Chamber stolen from Pushkino near St. 
Petersburg--Kinkel said that no traces of it have been found in 
Germany. Hundreds of thousands of museum exhibits, items of 
church utensils, and old icons have disappeared. The FRG 
government, Kinkel said, is promoting the search and return of 
the lost valuables, it has appealed to German citizens for 
support of its efforts. 
  Meanwhile, a list of the losses is being prepared in Russia. 
For the time being, we are talking about what was stolen in the 
suburbs of St. Petersburg--in Tsarskoye Selo, Peterhof, 
Pavlovskoye, Pushkino, as well as in Pskov and Novgorod. There 
is little hope that the German owners will bring the Russian 
icons and paintings in their possession to the FRG Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. Moscow is proposing compromises. One of them is 
the redemption of any valuable Russian cultural artifacts from 
the collections in the West at international auctions and their 
return to Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Shchipanov: "The Russian-Japanese </F>
Distinctive Mark"] 
  [Text] It is formed rather simply: If the Japanese minister 
of foreign affairs hurries to Moscow, the Russian president for 
sure will leave the capital. At first, having encountered the 
natural materialization of such a distinctive (moreover, 
correct) mark, the Japanese tried somehow to publicly express 
their dissatisfaction. Having arrived in Moscow 2 years ago to 
participate in an international conference on a Mideast 
settlement, Watanabe was unspeakably disappointed by the sad 
circumstance that, regardless of the importance of 
Russo-Japanese relations, B. Yeltsin will not be able to receive 
him. Today, already the successor of Watanabe, Tsutomu Hata, 
having found out that his long-ago planned visit coincided with 
the improvised departure of the president of Russia for Sochi, 
did not begin to display rude disapproval, although the Japanese 
side in mild form did reserve strictly surprise about such an 
unfortunate coincidence. 
  Moreover, evidently, there is no such anti-Japanese 
intention 
in the actions of our president. Now the administration is 
encountering much more serious problems than the fate of four 
points on the map--the Kurile Islands. And, therefore, the visit 
of a Japanese looks sooner like a tribute to general diplomatic 
routine: It was simply impossible for any "territorial 
break-throughs" to occur in the talks. The situation of the 
present patriotic rise is such that even to publicly hint at the 
return of the islands to Japan in the near historical future is 
dangerous. Even on Smolenskaya Ploshchad servility before the 
West is not in favor now. Even the transparent Japanese hints at 
the direct link between the territorial question and the 
extension of massive economic assistance to Russia do not 
produce the former impression on the Kremlin. 
  But since no Japanese spy was discovered in Moscow in recent 
weeks, the talks proceeded calmly. Both Kozyrev and Hata gently 
remained in their positions, not skimping on general diplomatic 
assurances of the highest respect for one another. 
  Moreover, Russia and Japan also have other points of mutual 
interests, in particular, the Japanese are ready to take upon 
themselves the burden of permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, and Russians would prefer to have a membership card of 
the club of the greatest industrial powers that is now called 
the "Great Seven." The Japanese have thus far not expressed 
special enthusiasm in regard to the transformation of the 
"Seven" into the "Eight." Even in the purely political sphere. 
But, one must suppose, bargaining is entirely appropriate here.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Vasilyev, director of Russian Academy of </F>
Sciences' Africa Institute, under "Problem" rubric: 
"Difficulties Can Be Overcome. Is Islamic Fundamentalism Such a 
Threat to Russia?"] 
  [Text] Some of the buzz-words in current Russian political 
cant are "civilization," "civilized behavior," "joining the 
civilized world," etc. But the references are exclusively to 
Western civilization; i.e., a term is used which was rejected by 
Western sociopolitical thought itself back in the early 20th 
century and was finally buried together with the collapse of 
fascist ideology. 
  Advocates of the idea of "ushering Russia into civilization" 
seem to forget the axiom of the diversity of civilizations: 
Western Christian, Confucian, Moslem, Eastern Slavic, and 
others. Each has its specific values and each will, in its way, 
contribute to the pluralist world civilization of the 21st 
century. Western domination of the Far East even in the 
technological field is now in doubt. And if something like this 
cannot yet be said of the Moslem world, who can predict the 
future? 
  However, the emergence of this discarded idea in the 
confused, sick social and political mind of Russia in a 
transitional period is not accidental. It reflects the 
unresolved question of Russia's self-identity. After the 
collapse of communism, that extreme, radical form of ideology 
imported from the West, the erstwhile debate between 
"Westerners" and "Slavophiles" has turned into a debate between 
"democrats" and "statists." The former advocate the idea of 
transplanting Western values to our inhospitable soil, the 
latter stress the preservation or restoration of special, 
exclusive traits characteristic of Russia. Naturally, in the 
framework of sociopolitical struggle there is no clearcut 
watershed between representatives of different trends. Likewise, 
there is no organic link between "democratic" and "statist" 
convictions and the positions of their representatives with 
respect to the Islamic world or Moslem citizens of Russia. 
Representatives of the opposing camps may come to terms on the 
basis of different premises for their negative attitudes towards 
Islam. Freshmen of the market and democracy school highhandedly 
attempt to teach Moslem countries and peoples the "values of 
civilization," while rabid chauvinists impose upon them their 
idea of "Russia ber alles." But strange as it may seem, 
understanding and cooperation with the Islamic world is 
advocated by both "communist-internationalists" and 
anticommunist "new Eurasians." 
  The picture is complicated by the fact that the quirks of 
history and geography require Russia to take a position in the 
discordant relations between the West and Islam. 
  The old confrontation between East and West, between Western 
democracy and communism, is being replaced by confrontation 
between the West and the Islamic world. Western public opinion 
is developing a partly true but generally artificial "enemy 
image" of the Moslem world, while Russia is being drawn into an 
unnecessary and alien conflict, the cost of participation in 
which may prove to be deadly high. Threats to the fate of Russia 
are appearing at three levels at once. Firstly, in relations 
with countries of the Moslem world outside the former USSR, 
especially those opting for models of sociopolitical orders 
differing from the West. Following the twists and turns of 
Western political behavior, Russia may get into confrontation 
with countries with which it has no contradictions. The 
unfriendly relations of Moscow with Iran and Libya, which have 
taken no anti-Russian actions on the governmental level, is the 
best example of this. If continued, such behavior will 
inevitably further weaken the already greatly deteriorated 
positions of Russia in the Moslem world. 
  An even greater threat may arise if Russia fails to launch a 
dialog and cooperation with Moslem nations of the near abroad. 
The matter here is not so much economic losses and difficulties 
along thousands of miles of common borders. At issue is the fate 
of Russian-speaking populations in the former soviet republics. 
The ghost of Bosnia and Herzogovina is stalking Central Asia and 
Transcaucasia. 
  Finally, the third level is Russian society itself. A 
special 
feature of Russia's historic development and geostrategic 
position is that it has not just lived next to the Moslem world; 
Russia has been as it were within that world, it was a border 
situation not only in the geographical sense. The confrontation 
between the two civilizations has been going on for a thousand 
years, but there has also been an intermingling and interaction 
of the cultural, sociopolitical and anthropological aspects. In 
the final analysis, not only Slavs are Russians "by blood," but 
also Ugro-Finns and Turks. There are common elements in music, 
dances, ornaments, poetics, national character and psychology. 
The life of Russian and Tatar villages in the Volga country 
differs only in minor details. The Cossacks were constantly 
replenished by Kalmyks, Circassians, Tatars and Kazakhs. 
Hundreds of nobility family names are of Turkic origin. Vaguely 
similar patterns can be found in Spain, the Balkans and India. 
But drawing parallels is dangerous. On the Iberian Peninsula 
history decreed that Islam would be eradicated, leaving behind 
traces in culture, the anthropological type of people, the 
psychology. A bloody drama has flared up again in the Balkans. 
India is seeking with difficulty ways of cohabitation among 
Moslems and non-Moslems. Will it find one? 
  Whereas in its search for self-identity Russia is in 
contradiction with itself, which is leading to a split between 
the intellectual and political elite and, as a consequence, of 
the masses, among peoples with Moslem roots one can observe a 
similar dualism with respect to themselves and the surrounding 
world. Their situation may be very broadly defined as a struggle 
between trends towards the Turkish or the Iranian model of 
development. Western influence, market relations and political 
practice draws them towards the early Turkish model (preferably 
the authoritarian model of Kemal Ataturk), while their own 
civilization, mythology, mass sentiment and demagogy tend 
towards the Iranian model. 
  In any case, in the post-soviet independent Moslem states 
the 
self-identity of both the political elites and the masses is 
based on Islamic nationalism. This assumes a certain 
"distancing" from Russia, as well as raising the level of 
anti-Russian sentiments. But whereas nationalism in the newly 
independent states assumes orientation towards the West, Islam 
looks to the East, or to be more precise in the strictly 
geographic sense, to the South. During the first two years or so 
of independence, the former soviet republics have already 
experienced a period of euphoria over the acquisition of 
brothers and cousins in both the ethnic and religious sense: 
Turks, Iranians, Arabs, Pakistanis. They have already 
experienced a period of hopes that "the West will help us" or 
"fraternal Moslem peoples will help us." These hopes failed to 
materialize in any real sense on either side. It turned out that 
Turkey, Iran, the Arabs, and the West were all pursuing their 
own attractively packaged but frequently self-serving 
objectives. While with Russia it was necessary to find a common 
language and mutual understanding. 
  "Attraction" will develop if, in the first place, Russia 
sets 
its own house in order, embarks on socioeconomic revival, and 
will be able to launch a constructive dialog and cooperation 
with both its own Moslem citizens and neighboring Moslem states. 
The prerequisites for this are there. After all, Russia (like 
the Soviet Union) was not an empire in the usual sense of the 
word. It lacked at least two basic elements that characterize an 
empire: economic exploitation of the outlying provinces by the 
Center and preferential social and material status of the 
Russian population with respect to other peoples. However, 
rational prerequisites do not necessarily always determine the 
social and political actions of people, political elites or 
nations. Relations between people and entire nations are 
frequently determined by nationalistic ideas and naked momentary 
egoism. 
  The road of dialog and cooperation between Russia and 
Moslems, as represented by communities, peoples and states, is 
filled with a number of dangers. One of them is fundamentalism. 
We shall not go into terminological or semantic investigations 
or recall that the term itself appeared several decades ago in 
Protestant religious thought. 
  The term fundamentalism assumes several interrelated 
elements; 
  --references solely to one's own real or imagined values: 
religious, cultural, legal, moral, ethical, sociopolitical, and 
others; 
  --juxtaposition of oneself against others, dividing the 
world 
into "us" and "them"; 
  --stressing incompatibility with others; 
  --readiness to resort to violence to impose one's own vision 
of the world and way of life. 
  It will be readily noticed that this definition covers all 
kinds of fundamentalism: Moslem and Protestant, Hindu and 
Russian Orthodox, liberal and Bolshevik... 
  Differences between peoples may be promoted by ideas and 
forces both within and outside a certain social entity. What 
matters is the actual effect of different ideas and forces. In 
this sense it would be worth taking a dispassionate look at the 
manifestations of, specifically, Islamic fundamentalism. In its 
extreme form it is an expression of the reaction of a society, a 
civilization, to its inequality in the world. Colonialism has 
gone but dependence on the West in the economic, technological, 
cultural, information and other spheres remains. The Soviet 
Union has collapsed, but de facto dependence on Russia remains. 
This gives rise to similar developments in different countries, 
be it "Moslem Brotherhoods" in Egypt, Syria or Jordan, the 
National Salvation Front in Algeria, Jamat-i-Islam in Pakistan, 
or the Islamic Renaissance Party in Russia and Central Asia. The 
founders of Moslem fundamentalism in Russia are not necessarily 
familiar with the writings of Moslem Brotherhood ideologues 
Hasan al-Banna or Sayyid Quth, but they are as adamant as those 
religious thinkers in their opposition to Western values, 
calling for a return to "the true Islam," application of Sharia 
as the legal basis of Moslem life, creation of an Islamic state 
and a Moslem economy. They also take similar positions on East 
Jerusalem and Palestine. Interestingly, though, Moslem 
fundamentalists derive some organizational forms of their 
activities from recent communist practice. 
  However, as in other cases, applying historical parallels to 
fundamentalists may be risky. Religious political extremism has 
gained virtually no foothold among Moslems in Russia. The 
Islamic Renaissance Party is hardly more than a network of small 
clubs. Nationalist slogans appeal more to the elites than to the 
masses. And even in Central Asia (in particular, Tajikistan), 
where the Islamic Renaissance Party was most successful, this 
was a manifestation not so much of the injection of politics 
into religion as simply clan hostility and rivalry. 
  Islamic fundamentalism poses no real threat to Russia. There 
is the threat of extremism if the socioeconomic and interethnic 
crisis continues to deepen, the threat of a rise of the 
threshold of information rejection and of a loss of the ability 
to engage in dialog. This makes impossible not only a transition 
to the information society, with its movement of information, 
but even the simple coexistence of peoples (Yugoslavia, Armenia, 
and Azerbaijan). At some stage in conflicts between confessional 
and ethnic groups their members simply cease to understand each 
other, whatever the educational or cultural level of 
individuals. A demonization as it were of the opponent occurs, 
cutting off all possibilities for dialog and compromise. 
  Difficulties of mutual understanding and cooperation may 
also 
be due to objective circumstances. In this sense the example of 
Chechnya is indicative. Russians and Chechens are alienated by 
historic memories of genocide, of which the Chechen people were 
victims three times: in the 19th century, the 1920s, and the 
1940s-1960s, during the period of mass deportations from the 
Northern Caucasus. The people survived, in particular, thanks to 
the clan structure of their society and the extensive 
proliferation of the Naqshbandiyah and Qadiriyah Sufi orders. 
That same structure makes it possible to quickly gain new 
socioeconomic positions in the developing market economy of 
Russia, frequently by criminal means. 
  Understanding between non-Moslems and Moslems is hindered by 
reciprocal incompetence and ignorance with regard to each other, 
the spread of myths which, through repetition, acquire the force 
of facts. It should be noted that in Russian sociopolitical 
thought, to say nothing of the mass media, there is a mishmash 
of entirely different concepts: "Moslem renaissance," 
"pan-Islamism," "Islamic fundamentalism," "Sufism." Similar 
ignorance, combined with extreme anti-Russian or anti-Christian 
attitudes, creates an explosive mixture on the other side. 
Speculating on ignorance and emotions may yield short-term 
political and daily life dividends, but it increases the level 
of tensions in religious and ethnic relations. As a result, 
instead of constructive dialog, the conflict expands. 
  References to sources, to the legal and behavioral norms of 
Islamic civilization create difficulties both within a 
multireligious society and in international relations, but these 
difficulties are not basically insurmountable for coexistence 
and cooperation. Sharia and the system of Western law (codified 
and based on precedent) would seem to be worlds apart and 
incompatible. The former regards law as a revelation of God, the 
latter as the people's will or customs that have become the 
norm. Identical situations (marriage, inheritance) are regulated 
differently in the West and in Moslem society. History knows 
examples of the total imposition of Western law (including 
transformed into communist form) on Moslem societies: Turkey, 
Yugoslavia, China, USSR. But hand in hand with the renaissance 
of Islam goes a revival of Sharia norms in the area of civil, 
family and other law. Is there a possibility for compromise? 
Yes, there is. 
  Many Moslem legal scholars are "reopening the doors of 
ijtihad," which were closed at the end of the 4th century of the 
Hijri (the 10th century of our era), i.e. they again recognize 
the ulemas' right to independently interpret and judge. For that 
they have the formal tools. According to most of the schools of 
Moslem legal scholars, there are areas in which Allah prohibits, 
does not recommend or, on the contrary, permits or does not 
object to, certain behavior or decisions. Between these four 
variants lies a fifth, "grey" zone, in which Allah is neutral 
and where the introduction of certain legal norms is possible, 
as long as they do not contradict the four others, in which the 
will of Allah is clearly expressed. Over the last century and a 
half, Sharia has demonstrated considerable abilities to adapt to 
new realities, from Osman trade and customs codes to traffic 
rules, from the establishment of a banking system which managed 
to skirt formal interest profit, to women's rights to education 
and work outside the family, or the waiving of fasting for air 
force pilots during Ramadan. 
  Russian society still must find a solution to problems 
connected with the revival of the fundamental postulates of 
Islam and the refusal of some citizens to obey a common unified 
system of law. Perhaps public practice will move ahead of legal 
norms and employers will take into account specific features of 
employing Moslem manpower during the Ramadan fast, the state 
will recognize Moslem holidays, to say nothing of cultural, 
enlightenment or religious activities of Moslem communities or 
the political rights of Moslem autonomous entities. In the final 
analysis, both the Russian and Moslem peoples have the 
historical experience not only of conflicts but also of 
cohabitation and mutual enrichment. 
  Russia's place and role in the new world order depends not 
only on its relations with the West, but also with the Islamic 
world. It will either find understanding and a basis for 
cooperation and constructive dialog with Moslems both outside 
and within or will sink into a protracted conflict with no 
solution in sight. It could bleed and weaken Russia so much that 
it would become a significant element contributing to the 
disintegration of the country and undermining its ability to 
develop. 
  Blind imitation of Western sociopolitical and economic 
models 
can cause and is already causing their rejection by Russian 
society. Mindless following of the most nearsighted Western 
prescriptions of confrontation with the Moslem world can be 
self-defeating. Russia should have its own road of internal 
development, taking into account world experience, and its own 
approach to the Moslem world.

Kazakhstan 13 February 1993 No. 97: `On the Formation and 
Development of Production of Hydrocarbon Raw Materials in the 
Kazakhstan Part of the Caspian Sea'"] 
  [Text] For the purpose of creating conditions for the 
accelerated evaluation and support of effective prospecting for 
and extraction of hydrocarbon raw materials in the coastal 
shallow water sectors of the Caspian Sea adjoining Atyrauskaya 
and Mangistauskaya Oblasts of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the 
Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan decrees: 
  1. To appoint the Ministry of Energy and Fuel Resources of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan as the organ responsible for

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Caspian Oil and Gas Project </F>
Consortium"] 
  [Text] In accordance with the Decree of the Cabinet of 
Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan of 13 February 1993 "On 
the Formation and Development of Production of Hydrocarbon Raw 
Materials in the Kazakhstan Part of the Caspian Sea," the 
Ministry of Energy and Fuel Resources of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan was instructed to establish the specialized company 
Kazakhstankaspiyshelf and to form an international consortium of 
major oil companies. A preliminary agreement concerning the 
consortium was signed on 9 June 1993. 
  Kazakhstan is represented in this consortium by the state 
company Kazakhstankaspiyshelf, which has been assigned the role 
of operator. By means of tender selection, a group of six 
foreign companies was identified as potential members of the 
consortium and satisfy the basic requirements of the Kazakhstan 
side: The British Petroleum-Statoil (Great Britain, Norway) 
alliance, British Gas (Great Britain), Shell (the Netherlands), 
Agip (Italy), Mobil (the United States), and Total (France). 
  The main criteria for selection of members of the consortium 
were: Work experience under conditions comparable to the Caspian 
shelf, taking into account the high ecological vulnerability of 
the territory, thorough analysis of technical and technological 
proposals, and potential financial capabilities of the companies. 
  Implementation of the first stage of the state program for 
developing the shelf deposits of oil and gas of the Caspian Sea 
includes a three-year program of geological-geophysical and 
ecological research. 
  The following basic tasks are being given to the consortium: 
  --conducting maritime geophysical exploration on the shelf 
of 
the Caspian Sea for the purpose of studying its geologic 
formation and evaluating the prospects of oil and gas content; 
  --reequipping Kazakhstani geophysical enterprises with 
modern 
recording apparatuses, a processing computer complex, and other 
means of supporting maritime geological prospecting work; 
  --training Kazakhstani technical personnel in modern methods 
of conducting maritime oil prospecting work; 
  --technical and financial assistance for the development of 
a 
local infrastructure. 
  The foreign members of the consortium will fully finance the 
execution of work of the approved program. The total sum of the 
investment for the production of maritime geophysical work will 
amount to several hundred million U.S. dollars, including 
expenditures on the development of infrastructure, training, 
ecology, and the social sphere. 
  Members of the consortium are extended the following 
privileges: 
  --conduct of the first round of licensing is guaranteed 
after 
the conclusion of the first stage of the explorations in the 
most promising areas of the shelf of the Caspian Sea only among 
the members of the consortium; 
  --after receiving a license for prospecting and production, 
members of the consortium are authorized to include in the 
recoupment part expenditures for the stage of geological 
exploration. 
  Under all circumstances, Kazakhstan is the exclusive owner 
of 
information and data obtained as a result of execution of the 
program.

  [Text] The free man often forgets about his freedom, in the 
same way he forgets about his face or his eyes. 
  The free man views his freedom as a natural part of his life 
and does not find amazement in it or weep for joy; it does not 
enter his mind that it might be a great blessing sent from God 
the Almighty. 
  Once freedom was a blessing, and, since mankind descended to 
earth with Adam and Eve, they have striven for this sacred 
blessing; all struggles in world history have been to attain 
this blessing or in order not to lose it. 
  If the state is free -- this is a blessing; if the nation is 
free and each member of the nation is free -- this is a blessing. 
  If, when a man enters his home and talks with those near to 
him and does not lower his voice, does not think of listening 
devices -- this is a blessing. 
  If "security officials" do not threaten him, if they do not 
throw him into a car and then beat him mercilessly, if they do 
not throw him into prison -- this is a blessing. 
  Every thinking person in all of Uzbekistan wants normal 
blessings like these. When they write our government, it is not 
always about "bread and meat alone," but also they also express 
the wish for normal human rights. 
  Certainly man needs meat, bread, and rice. The government of 
Uzbekistan has promised these blessings over the last four 
years. For four years this government has said " we are putting 
the economy ahead of politics because first we have to fill the 
people's stomach," but the people's stomach are still not full; 
on the contrary, the people sink further into poverty every day. 
  Because an economy that is not free can never fill the 
people's stomach -- freedom is also necessary to the economy. 
  Today, every social stratum in Uzbekistan understands this 
truth. Approximately two years ago the urban population which 
was living rather well -- intellectuals, civil servants, and 
workers, began to view with doubt todays' "precedence of 
economics over politics." 
  Even some government organs and some members of the 
government began to understand this truth. As a result of this 
mistaken policy Uzbekistan's standard of living has dropped to 
one of the lowest in the world: the republic has not moved 
forward, it has fallen ten years behind. 
  Who will answer for this? 
  The majority say, "the present government has to answer for 
this." 
  True, the day for an answer has come, but this "answer" can 
never make up for the time that has been lost. We need the 
answer not in the "future," but now. This government, 
undoubtedly, will go down as one of the worst in our history, 
and there are many who want an answer to this question. But the 
answer must not come from some low-level bureaucrat, but from 
the tyrant now sitting on the throne. 
  ERK newspaper has once again come forward to ask for an 
answer. 
  May your eyes be clear, yearners for freedom!

  [Text] Changes in the election law and Constitution passed 
at the last session of the Uzbekistan High Assembly are another 
step toward strengthening the antidemocratic regime. 
  As a consequence of these measures, the Uzbekistan can 
control elections completely, allow a desired party to take part 
in the election or declare an undesired party illegal. In fact, 
the Assembly legalized a one-party system. 
  Aside from this, the results of the 1993 Assembly were 
uninspired. There was neither applause nor praise. Even the 
fawning lickspittles reaching out to the tribunal seemed 
dispirited and no one made a speech. 
  Not even the "retirement" of the Assembly chairman Sh. 
Yoldoshev could disturb the numbness of the deputies. And 
President I. Karimov's amazing question of the type of "why do 
you all look so tired?" remained without influence. 
  In the opinion of observers, this situation is a sign of 
confusion in the ranks of government cadres. 
  The ties between the government and the cadres are becoming 
weaker every day. 
  The cadres' lack of belief in the leadership is constantly 
growing stronger. As they begin to fear for their own positions 
and future, so do they fear for the future of the state. This 
situation was clearly felt at the High Assembly's last session.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Solih: "Toward Clarity"] </F>
  [Text] Every day you read, hear or see various types of 
information in the newspapers or on radio or television and you 
draw conclusions about the life of the republic. 
  It is possible that my essay today will make a small 
addition 
to these conclusions you have drawn. 
  It is not possible to show political activity in Uzbekistan 
today. In the street, the home, at the workplace -- everywhere 
there are spies, every day there are new intrigues, new 
investigations, new crimes, new punishments. 
  Together with everybody else, I have not remained without 
sin. They have accused me of attempting to overthrow the state. 
  Let me briefly explain the situation: in the Summer of 1992 
a 
group of activists decided a public organization called 
"National Assembly" in order to help Parliament in pushing 
through laws. I was informed about this, but I said that the Erk 
Party would not join this organization. They accused me of being 
among the members of an organization which had still not been 
organized. We were eight people intending to overthrow the 
state. At the same time, the "National Assembly" plan had been 
sent to the President in order to provide him with advice. 
  Now, do you imagine that men planning to overthrow the state 
would send their plans to the man standing at the head of the 
state? What would they say, "Respected president, we intend to 
overthrow the state, here is some advice?" 
  Procurator Jorayev himself exposed to the entire world in 
the 
11 August issue of KHALQ SOZI newspaper that the accusation 
which was made was meaningless. Jorayev wrote: "The National 
Assembly program is known to all; it consists of generalities 
taken from other sources and there is nothing new in it." 
  If the words in the "National Assembly" program -- the basic 
documentation of the crime which was committed -- are words 
known to everyone, and if this were not sufficient, if they were 
general words taken from other sources and if there is nothing 
new in them, what is the crime in this program? 
  Praise be to Jorayev: through the shrewdness of his words, 
he 
condemned the political order in Uzbekistan. But not even a 
lawyer like Jorayev can revive the complete innocence of the 
activists of the "National Assembly." 
  All of Uzbekistan was amused for days by this. 
  But our hope is in the future. Those striving to bring this 
hope to life exist in Uzbekistan. Let me inform you briefly 
about one of the components of these forces, the Erk Party. 
  The Erk Party is an opposition party. Why is an opposition 
necessary? 
  First, an opposition is necessary in the capacity of a 
helper, an advisor to the existing government in the urgent 
political and economic questions in the republic. In addition, 
the opposition is needed to control the rule of the party or 
group that has gone to the pinnacle of the state. Thus, the 
rulers should not become angry, nor should they view the people 
as their own property. 
  Control by the opposition is completely different that 
control by state organs -- this control is the control by 
political forces, in the broadest sense, by social forces, which 
are not in the government. 
  If the opposition party makes the people understand its 
program in an election and this party comes into government; the 
defeated party leaves th government and becomes the opposition 
itself. And that is all it is. 
  This rule is a daily rule in the Western states. In these 
states, no government would hasten to cut down the opposition as 
quickly as Uzbekistan's government. 
  For three years, the Erk Party is a party that has survived 
by evading the axe. 
  If this party came to government, what would it give the 
people? Various people have asked me this question under various 
conditions. Unfortunately, I have had slight opportunity to 
answer it. 
  In Uzbekistan the majority of people are not familiar with 
the Erk program. The government says that the people should 
neither know nor hear about this program and, to a certain 
extent, it has attained its goal. 
  Permission to print the economic program of the Erk Party in 
the newspaper ERK, which is its own newspaper, has not been 
granted because if the program is published the government could 
not make the claim that "the opposition has no program." 
  If the program were published in the newspaper, proponents 
of 
Erk would increase and would become dangerous to the government. 
  According to the economic views of the Erk Party, I would 
appeal first to the peasants: If Erk comes into the government, 
it would not take anything out of your pockets but would 
probably give you your own property. Then you would not stare at 
the chairman when he tells you how much of our cotton the state 
will take, but you would sell the cotton at the price you want. 
At that time the chairman would not tell you and your 
grandfather what to do because not only the cotton, but also the 
land would be yours. 
  An Erk Party government would begin privatizing land bit by 
bit. This means that it would be leased; profitable lands would 
be the first to be leased; that is to say, these lands would be 
given to the leaseholder in perpetuity. 
  At the same time, all kolkhoz lands would be converted into 
the form of full leases and these, in the course of two of three 
years based on the income taken out of them, would be turned 
over to the leaseholders as private property. 
  As for the revived kolkhoz itself, if society benefits from 
it, it is possible that it would survive on an equal basis with 
private enterprises. But, we would have to see, because today 
there is no kolkhoz which is not in debt to the state: for this 
reason, the Erk Party thinks that the kolkhoz system has no 
future. 
  It is possible that the privatization movement will not take 
one-two years, but longer because before enterprises can take on 
a new form it will be necessary to create the technical and 
material basis for them. Until these enterprises are standing on 
their own feet after these measures are taken, they will either 
not be taxed or taxed at a minimal level. 
  In village areas small firms and factories would begin to be 
built which would process the product on the spot. The state 
would take on the responsibility of supplying them with 
equipment because private enterprises could not survive at the 
initial stage without help from the state. 
  In brief, the Erk Party will begin its work with land 
reform; 
in the first five years, the basic plan of action will take not 
heavy industry, but light industry into consideration. Seventy 
percent of Uzbekistan's population lives in villages and if land 
reform is successfully implemented, 70 percent of the population 
of our nation will be saved from sinking into poverty. 
  Through these economic measures, a national property census 
will be taken. And, outside of large factories and heavy 
industry, all middle-sized and small plants will begin to be 
privatized. 
  The Erk Party will begin its fight for the preservation of 
nature with the severe consequences of the cotton monoculture. A 
state must be concerned for the health of its population before 
everything else. The Erk Part views this question as a question 
of equals importance to the economic and political questions, 
and will expend all its strength to resolve it. A government 
which thinks that the problem will be resolved by burdening 
public organizations like the Aral Committee with it is 
irresponsible. 
  On the work of the Erk Party on political reforms 
  The Erk Party considers its basic goal to be the 
transformation of Uzbekistan into a democratic state. 
  In order to build a democratic state, passing a democratic 
Constitution is not enough in itself. Uzbekistan's people have a 
democratic Constitution, but this Constitution cannot improve 
the lot of Uzbekistan's people. The leadership rules over the 
will of the people, not the laws or the Constitution. Today they 
have sat on the Constitution; a democratic state would remove 
the Constitution from under these bureaucrats and would raise it 
to the necessary level. 
  Thus, they would be able to prevent all kinds of distortions 
in a democratic society. By the same token, neither leftwing 
forces nor rightwing forces would be able to endanger the state. 
In other words, a true structure, we think a democratic system 
could come into being in the state, not a group of bloodthirsty 
officials. 
  What do we mean by a democratic system? 
  Let me give an example: let us say a racist becomes the head 
of government in England. This individual would be unable to 
change English policy to a racist policy because the democratic 
mechanism of the state would force this person to act within 
certain limits. If this person opposed the system, the system 
would remove him from the government. This means that in such a 
system the coming into power of a fascist or a madman would be 
quite improbable. 
  Now if Tashmat ascends to the throne in states lacking a 
democratic order but only a tyranny, the entire state follows 
Tashmat's policy; if Ashmat mounts to the throne, it follows 
Ashmat's policy. In other words, if Tashmat and Ashmat are both 
crazy, or if they are treasonous, both the state and the nation 
are in terrible danger. 
  Thus, the Erk Party considers that a state built on the 
democratic principle is the most credible state. 
  Let me say a few words about the Erk Party's cadre policy. 
  The Erk Party believes that the cadres will play an 
important 
role in the building of a new state. In this sector we have a 
traditional sickness-- localism. Our leadership, instead of 
understanding that our nation cannot be divided from its people, 
has pursued a divisive policy, and has descended into localism. 
This policy seriously poisons the minds of our people, and it 
will demand considerable work to drive this poison out. The Erk 
Party will take this selfless task on its own shoulders and root 
out the divisive policy. 
  Cadres, primarily, will be selected according to their worth 
and then their willingness to work in the interests of the state. 
  They will be given the opportunity to work creatively within 
their duties and to take a creative approach to their jobs. In 
other words, they will not have to ask the president for 
permission to do everything as they do now; independent and 
intelligent officials will not sidestep difficult problems, they 
will just resolve them. 
  Every official will be evaluated at his rank within the 
state 
and will be compensated for his work and trustworthiness. 
  Officials will not be insulted by their bosses, and 
shortcomings in the official's personal life will not be judged 
by the administration. 
  They will be paid enough to lead a free and straightforward 
life, and all possibilities for their retirement to normal life 
will be created. 
  Whether one is a normal official, deputy, teacher at a 
university of a physician, he will live with the feeling that "I 
am necessary to the state, and the state will also reinforce 
this idea. 
  In its turn, the state will demand definite responsibility 
from the official. When the official is in the administration, 
it will be a condition that he knows that the state's interest 
and authority is his primary goal. Every minor complaint against 
the official will be investigated in depth by the state and 
appropriate measures taken. 
  An official who takes a bribe will be punished mercilessly 
by 
the state. The state has the legal and moral right to do this 
because the state will have guaranteed its officials with the 
salaries and privileges at a level where they will not feel the 
need to break the law. 
  The most severe punishments will be given to officials who 
betray the interests of the state. 
  In this way, as long as the state finds it useful to defend 
its officials and guarantee their [word obliterated], it will 
also be in the officials' interests to provide their services 
honestly to the state. 
  The Erk Party's ideological statement is brief: national 
awakening and an independent state. 
  These ideological examples are not from a brochure by Erk's 
leadership, but taken from the rich history of our nation. 
  Starting at the beginning of our century, the Djadidist 
movement brought forth a new national ideology. This movement 
was not guided by the khanate or the governate, but by 
politically educated groups and free-thinking enlightened 
people. These societies evoked the people's ideals and 
comprehended their hopes, aspirations and sorrows clearly and 
precisely. 
  All organizations similar to this could manifest themselves 
in cultural-educational, historical, language or newspaper 
societies. Similar organizations began to form two years ago but 
were quickly closed down. 
  The writers' union was such an organization but, 
unfortunately, it split and quarreled over authority and divided 
its prizes. 
  The state does not have to close these societies, on the 
contrary, it should support and strengthen them. The state has 
to create its own ideology on the foundations of these 
societies. Thus, the new state would gain trust among the 
people. Once this trust is gained, then the state has a job to 
do: it must prepare the economic and political basis for the 
ideology it is creating. In other words, without reforms 
everything we have stated above will remain beautiful ideas or 
mere embroidery. 
  For the state to make its people follow its ideology, it 
must 
grant political and economic freedoms to them. The person with a 
fettered mind cannot love his nation nor can he be committed to 
it. The poor man is that way. 
  Erk Party's views on religion 
  The Erk Party is for giving complete freedom to religious 
organizations because faith is inherent, and those believing in 
Allah can be useful to society. Even if they do not contribute 
to society, they do no harm. This philosophy expresses the Erk 
Party's relationship to religion completely. 
  Specifically, educated religious leaders can help in the 
spiritual health of the new state we are building. They will 
show enthusiasm in nourishing with purity and faith the 
emptiness in the hearts of our nation which has undergone a 
century of slavery. 
  As for "Islamic fundamentalism," that is something to think 
about. In general, religious radicalism is foreign to the nature 
of the Turkic peoples. In fact, our ancestors never promoted a 
policy of ignorance in the religious sector. 
  The Turkic peoples were at the forefront in spreading Islam; 
the conquered other nations but always distanced themselves from 
religious ignorance, and propagandized their own religion by 
means of education. 
  Today, some of our friends, calling themselves religious 
believers, say mistakenly to males "if you wear a necktie, you 
are an unbeliever" are to females "if you do not wear the veil, 
you are an unbeliever." But faith lives in our hearts, not our 
clothing. If, instead of faith in the hear there is misery, and 
if such a woman puts on the veil, the veil only covers the 
misery. 
  Islamic educators direct their training toward mankind's 
inner world. Islamic elements, not the veil or turban, are in 
service to Allah and this belief. 
  Twenty years ago there were 400 thousand Muslims in Europe. 
Today, there are four million Muslims in Europe, the majority of 
whom are European. These people are not under the influence of 
simplistic Islamic propagandists for Islam, but have read the 
blessed Koran. Otherwise, they have accepted this religion under 
the influence of deep-thinking Islamic propagandists. 
  Simplistic propagandists have always done more harm to Islam 
than good. This simplistic philosophy was the cause of the 
centuries-old degraded condition of Islam in Turkestan. The 
"Islamic obedience" taught by these simple mollas was a way of 
extending the life of Tsarist Russian colonialism in Turkestan. 
However, Islam is not a religion of obedience or subjugation. 
Islam is a religion of courage and valor. Islam teaches one to 
bow his head to no one but Allah. Islam teaches one to fear 
nothing but Allah. 
  Abukadir Al Jazairi, a mujahid who fought against French 
colonialism, was asked by Western reporters "Why do your 
soldiers not fear death?" He answered: "Because my soldiers 
believe in Allah. They know that their lives are not in the 
hands of the enemy, but in the hands of Allah. Thus, why should 
they fear the enemy?" 
  Our children should be trained with such faith.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sh. Karimov, by UzA [Uzbek Agency] </F>
correspondent A. Niyaziy: "The Generation's Health Is the 
Country's Wealth: Interview With Shavkat Karimov, Health 
Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan"] 
  [Text] [Niyaziy] Shavkat Ibragimovich, it is completely 
obvious that an economic reform cannot have an effect on all 
spheres of social life. What effect on the nation's health is 
exerted by the economic reform being carried out in Uzbekistan 
--the changeover to a different system? 
  [Karimov] Actually, during the period of the changeover to 
market relations it is impossible to take a superficial attitude 
toward the questions of the social protection of the workers. In 
essence, any reform is carried out for the good of the nation. 
  For three years the economic reform has been carried out in 
the country. At the same time, as compared with other states in 
the Community, a lot has been done in our republic to improve 
the social protection of the population. Naturally, the question 
arises: how was it possible to achieve this in the complicated 
conditions of the changeover to market relations, when the 
economy frequently comes up against unforeseen difficulties? But 
the fact of the matter here is that, unlike many countries in 
the CIS, the social protection of the population in Uzbekistan 
has been elevated to the rank of state policy. 
  It is precisely the need to carry out a strong social policy 
that stipulates one of the five basic principles of creating a 
new society in our country. That is why, for the last three 
years, that the health indicators in our republic have been 
rather good. Whereas the average life expectancy in 1991 in our 
republic was 69.3 years, in Russia it dropped from 69.6 to 66. 
Child mortality for each thousand newborn infants in Uzbekistan 
dropped from 37.3 in 1992 to 31.6 in 1993, and the death rate in 
childbirth dropped from 79 to 41.6. 
  [Niyaziy] What do you think is the basic factor for the 
improvement in these indicators? 
  [Karimov] This is achieved basically thanks to the concern 
that is shown and to the implementation of our President's 
edicts in this area and the "Soglom Avlod Uchun" state program. 
The goal of this program is clear-cut: in order for the future 
generation to grow up healthy, the children must be born 
healthy. And that will be possible when the mothers are healthy. 
This is the indisputable truth that constitutes the basic 
essence of the program. 
  We carried out a preventive study of 5.1 million women. On 
the basis of the survey results they were grouped into three 
different groups. The first group includes healthy women who are 
capable of giving birth to healthy children -- as many as they 
want. The second consists of women who have been subjected to 
some kind of ailment. They must, first of all, restore their own 
health, and only then will they be able to give birth to a child 
under a physician's constant observation. But for the women in 
the third group it is recommended that they not give birth to 
children, inasmuch as they are suffering from serious, chronic 
ailments, and for them giving birth to a child would result in 
weakened descendants and would represent a danger for the 
mother's own health. Public health workers have been engaging 
very actively in improving the health of the women included in 
the second and third groups. 
  As is attested to by science, the most favorable period for 
women to give birth is the age between 20 and 35 years. At that 
time, as a rule, healthy, capable, beautiful children are born. 
In addition, for the best possible development of the child, it 
is important for him to be nourished by his mother's milk. It is 
not accidental that 1993 was declared the "Year of Mother's 
Milk." In nature there is no product that is capable of 
replacing mother's milk. That is the medical side of the 
question, but there is also a moral side: as he takes in his 
mother's milk, he also absorbs love and all the higher feelings. 
That kind of child acquires an immunity to diseases and has a 
loving attitude toward his parents and to everyone else. It is 
for good reason that people say, "If a person's mind has not 
been nurtured on mother's milk, you cannot grow him on cow's 
milk." Therefore among our nation it used to be customary to 
breastfeed boys until the age of 30 months and girls until the 
age of 24 months. That idea has also been reflected in the "For 
a Healthy Population" program. 
  In order to bring up a healthy generation it is necessary to 
have a healthy way of life. Therefore Uzbekistan is the only 
country in the world in which the "Soglom Avlod Uchun" Order has 
been established, and an international fund has created with the 
same name. As you might recall, our President's first edicts 
were aimed at protecting and strengthening the health of mother 
and child. Concern for the fate of future generations has been 
firmly stated in legislation and has been embodied in the free 
distribution of food products for pregnant women in low-income 
families. Our President has also promulgated an Edict dealing 
with the providing of medicines to pregnant women on a 
preferential basis. 
  Unfortunately, in certain places these measures are not 
being 
carried out properly. I would like to emphasize that the state 
strives, to the best of its abilities, to support and strengthen 
every family. So if certain families, having forgotten their 
duty to the state, do not care about whether they are giving 
birth to a healthy child, are they raising that child correctly 
for society? Will today's infants be able in the future to 
become the best kind of citizens, and to multiply their 
Homeland's wealth? 
  [Niyaziy] How do you evaluate the demographic situation in 
Uzbekistan? 
  [Karimov] The population increase in the republic is stable. 
Every year something of the order of 700,000 children are born 
in our republic. The natural mortality rate constitutes 150,000 
persons. Consequently, every year the population increases by an 
average of 500,000 persons. That is, the republic is growing 
younger from year to year. Currently 48 percent of the 
population is made up of young men and women below the age of 18 
years. The future of our state will be determined specifically 
by these young people. 
  At the same time, according to data that is available to us, 
in 1993 the level of the natural mortality in Russia increased 
from 12 to 15 percent. Consequently, the population decreased by 
approximately 800,000 persons. And, as the specialists attest, 
if extraordinary measures are not taken, this process can become 
worse and can lead a great power to serious consequences. 
  In Uzbekistan the approach to this problem is completely 
defined. As I mentioned, before introducing market relations in 
our republic, the state policy on the social protection of the 
population was defined. Life confirms the correctness of the 
path that was chosen by Uzbekistan and reinforces one's faith 
that our republic will become a great state.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.G. Konyukhov, first deputy chairman of the </F>
Uzbekistan State Committee for Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources, by N. Shulepina, under the "Man and 
Biosphere" rubric; place and date not given: "`The Aral 
Program'--For Five States"] 
  [Text] At the Nukus meeting, the heads of five states 
approved a program of concrete actions aimed at the improvement 
of the ecological situation over the next three to five years in 
the Aral Sea basin. What are Uzbek ecologists to do within the 
framework of the program? Our interlocutor is V.G. Konyukhov, 
first deputy chairman of the Uzbekistan State Committee for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. 
  [Shulepina] Vladimir Grigoryevich, what is the program? 
  [Konyukhov] The program considers the experience of 
ecologists and water management specialists of Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Concrete 
tasks are laid out, concisely and in depth, in 10 blocks. We 
have already worked on many of them, and now we will concentrate 
our efforts. 
  [Shulepina] What is the most important task? 
  [Konyukhov] To work out a general strategy of water 
apportionment. There ought to be enough water for everyone. The 
Amudarya and Syrdarya interrepublican basin water management 
associations have been created and have given good account of 
themselves, but a general legal base is necessary, and it is 
planned to introduce a single system of calculating water 
resources and their use. We will know how many water resources 
we have, and we will be able to establish practicable usage 
norms in the production of agricultural and industrial output. 
  The same goal may be served by a regional system of 
ecological monitoring. Hitherto, we have not had complete 
information on the condition of the natural environment. In 
Uzbekistan, the committees of the State Committee for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Tashkent, the 
oblasts, and Karakalpakstan have been connected in a single 
electronic network. A project for the creation of a system of 
ecological monitoring in Fergana is ready. Such a system is 
being prepared for the industrial cities of Tashkent Oblast. 
  The creation of monitoring in accordance with the program in 
Uzbekistan and in other republics is being accelerated. Basin 
water management associations and the observation points of 
hydrometeorological services will be supplied with technical 
equipment. 
  [Shulepina] Monitoring is necessary, but it is already well 
known that the quality of the water is falling. How is this 
process to be stopped? 
  [Konyukhov] That is one of the directions in which the five 
states have worked together on the contiguous territories. Thus, 
a year ago, Uzbekistan Hydrometeorology and Environmental 
Control Service posts noted significant discharges of harmful 
substances from the Osh cotton combine. We offered our neighbors 
effective technology from the Tashkent institute Vodgeo, which 
had been tested at the Namangansk silk combine. It will allow 
the volume of water used in Osh to be reduced by 70 percent, and 
losses of dye substances to be decreased. Such technologies are 
taking root at light industry enterprises of Andizhan and 
Bukhara Oblasts. 
  In the program it is planned to take effective measures on 
the reduction, and in the future the complete cessation, of 
discharges of unpurified industrial and municipal drainage. For 
this, not a little has been done in Uzbekistan within the 
framework of the program of water conservation in industry. The 
Tashkent paper plant and the Yangiyul biological industrial 
complex have reduced their discharges, and the Novokokand 
chemical plant has been reprofiled. There were many complaints 
against the Tashkent Aviation Production Association imeni 
Chkalov--here preoperational testing of new and powerful 
cleansing installations has begun. The same are being proclaimed 
at Elektrokhimprom, in Chirchik.... We will continue our efforts 
toward reducing industry's negative influences. 
  [Shulepina] A large problem is stopping runoffs into rivers 
and collector and drainage canals. "Relatively clean"--this is 
how their quality is described. Meanwhile, they contain 
pesticides, mineral salts, and drainage from livestock-raising 
complexes, which end up in Aral. What is to be done? 
  [Konyukhov] In 1997 the construction of collector channels 
along the Amudarya and the Syrdarya will be completed. We will 
divert dirty discharges from the rivers. But a complete solution 
to the problem lies in treatment of the drainage water. 
Effective methods have been worked out at the ecology of water 
management center of the State Committee for Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources. These methods are already 
being applied in the Aral region. In the region of Muynak Bay 
and the lakes Dzhiltyrbas, Sudochye, and Togiz-Tore, shallow 
reservoirs have been created, which have turned into rushy 
jungles. There are enough of them to feed a herd of 50,000 head. 
And the root system of the rushes, and the midges and plankton 
that arise in the process of biocenosis, clean the water. It can 
go both for the renovation of pastures in Kyzylkum and for 
intensive fish-farming. The program envisions in the Aral region 
the conduct of plant reclamation projects and the creation of 
artificially irrigated landscape systems. But the same 
technology could also be applied at rivers' headwaters. 
  [Shulepina] In many rayons, a shortage of good-quality 
drinking water is being felt.... 
  [Konyukhov] The provision to the population of the Central 
Asian states of high-quality drinking water is one of the main 
tasks. Pollution of underground lentils--a most important source 
of drinking water--and of subsoil waters has taken on massive 
scope. All sources of pollution must be brought to light and 
eliminated. 
  In Uzbekistan, valuable experience in the conduct of such 
work has been accumulated. An impetus to this was the pollution 
of underground water near the Chkalovskaya metro station in 
Tashkent three or four years ago. The method used by the 
geo-ecologists from the Kyzyltepageologiya association ranks as 
a discovery. Directly from a car, with special equipment, they 
were able to see what was under the earth and discern the source 
of the pollution. They conducted analyses at the Fergana furan 
compound plant and the Kokand asphalt and cement plant, and 
compiled an atlas of pollution in Chimkent [Shimkent] and 
Tashkent Oblasts. Now analyses are being conducted of the 
underground waters in the large area of the Aral region and in 
the lands of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and our republic, and 
also in Tashlak and Tashkent. 
  [Shulepina] How do pesticides influence the quality of 
underground water? 
  [Konyukhov] The greatest danger is dozens of tonnes of 
pesticides, whose use is forbidden and which are located in 
Uzselkhozkhimiya [Uzbekistan Agricultural Chemical Association] 
warehouses in various rayons in the republic. We evaluate them 
as ecological bombs. The barrels are rusting; leakages will 
begin, and then everything will go into the soil. At the 
Atmosphere Institute, technology for the destruction of 
pesticides has been worked out. This method takes place at high 
temperatures and is harmless. The end product is a clean powder. 
We offered the pesticide-processing technology to the Ministry 
of Agriculture. This technology has regional significance. 
  [Shulepina] The solution of any problem can be slowed down 
by 
a lack of funds. What mechanism is envisioned for the 
realization of the program of concrete measures for the Aral Sea 
basin? 
  [Konyukhov] An international fund to save Aral has been 
created. Funds will be transferred into it, as was decided at 
the meeting in Nukus, after the currency quotation coordination 
by the governments of the states in the near future. In 
addition, we are also counting on assistance from the world 
community. As is known, the Aral problem is acknowledged as one 
of the most important. Experts of the World Bank have already 
been working in the region; an impediment to the rendering of 
assistance was a lack of unity in the understanding of help for 
Aral's problems among the states of the region. Literally in the 
very first days after the Nukus meeting, calls from 
international organizations and banks began, informing us of 
their readiness to begin real cooperation. 
  And concrete leadership and supervision over the carrying 
out 
of the program will be implemented by the interstate council on 
the problems of the Aral Sea basin, the position on which was 
also adopted at the Nukus meeting, and its executive committee, 
for whose headquarters Tashkent was chosen. 
  [Shulepina] Vladimir Grigoryevich, a minimum program has 
been 
adopted. Who determines, and when, what is to be done further? 
  [Konyukhov] Ecologists and water management specialists of 
the five states are proceeding with the elaboration of a 
medium-term program, which is calculated for five to 10 years, 
and a long-term program, which will cover 10 years and more. At 
the same time, we will be working on a conception of improvement 
of the social and ecological situation in the Aral Sea basin; as 
yet, only its basic provisions have been coordinated. 
  All water-management and ecological projects will pass 
through the most rigorous expert examination. After completion 
of preparatory work, the region's heads of state will determine, 
as was envisioned in Nukus, a long-term unified ecological 
policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chairman of the Government of Russia V. </F>
Chernomyrdin by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Editor in Chief V. Starkov; 
place and date not given: "V. Chernomyrdin: `I Will Not Be 
Distracted!'"] 
  [Text] [Starkov] Viktor Stepanovich, how do you feel about 
criticism? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I take it rather calmly. I realize that it is 
inevitable. I am not against being criticized. And frankly, 
there is not much to praise me for--this is a very difficult 
period! But I am a realist. And an optimist. 
  It so happened that I became a big boss a long time ago. 
What 
I learned over these years is that emotions at work should be 
kept to a minimum. I follow the rule: Look calmly and select 
what is right and realistic. And discard the rest. 
  [Starkov] It so happens that we are meeting and talking at a 
time of sharp political turns. It is clear now what kind of 
"mess" you have found yourself in: inflation, prices, strikes, 
production decline, pickets at the White House... 
  [Chernomyrdin] Yours is not a regular newspaper--it is 
popular. I have not met with anyone as frequently as you--this 
is the third time. It is true that it is a difficult time. But 
when was it easy? Now even those who had absolutely no faith in 
me are amazed: What is this--Chernomyrdin is still prime 
minister, as before, and nothing has got worse? They kept 
saying: Since Fedorov and Gaydar have left, everything will 
disintegrate. As if I worked "under" them. No, Chernomyrdin 
keeps working, as before. 
  [Starkov] I talked to Gaydar recently. He said that as prime 
minister you have three choices. One--to give money to everyone 
who asks for it. Then you will be the "good guy." Second--not 
give anything to anybody. That will make you "bad." Gaydar 
suggested that you, with your typical managerial skill, will 
choose some third option: You will remain on friendly terms with 
enterprise directors while at the same time not allowing money 
to be handed out right and left. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Correct. He worked with me and understands my 
tactics. Even when he asked, I frequently refused. By the way, I 
do not have any bad feelings about Yegor Timurovich. And I do 
not particularly criticize him anywhere. The only thing that 
irks me is when people say: this is "Chernomyrdin's," this is 
"Gaydar's," this is "Fedorov's..." We all worked together, as 
one team, and made decisions jointly. 
  [Starkov] I remember you telling me that you did not want to 
turn into a politician; that you are an economic manager. But 
politics drew you into its vortex; it is amazing that you find 
enough strength to withstand it. In other countries at a time of 
fundamental reforms the government changes three times a month; 
you have managed to survive for almost a year and a half. What 
is this: cunning, smarts, or something else? What is your main 
secret? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I would prefer not to oversimplify matters. 
For instance, I have never been afraid to learn, no matter how 
high a job I held. I learn from everybody. From you, too, by the 
way (laughs). I take everything that is best, useful for work. I 
am not afraid to ask something I do not understand. I will never 
say that I can do everything, that I have a ready answer for 
everything. 
  [Starkov] Do you not have a sense of panic? 
  [Chernomyrdin] No, I absolutely do not. Yes, things are 
difficult now. But unfortunately, it is impossible to travel our 
road without losses. We have to travel it with dignity, without 
panic. The country, the president, and I. I do not want people 
to separate us. I do not want to shift my work onto him. I am 
responsible for what I do, and I will face this responsibility. 
  [Starkov] That is, you do not run to him for advice on every 
matter. 
  [Chernomyrdin] God forbid; this would be insulting for me. 
  [Starkov] I can feel that today you are on a sort of equal 
footing with him. 
  [Chernomyrdin] When it is a major issue, I will find the 
president myself wherever he is and will definitely seek his 
advice. And Boris Nikolayevich, too, now consults with me 
increasingly more often. There are questions that only the 
president deals with; nobody else is needed there, not 
Chernomyrdin or anyone else. But there also are matters that are 
purely mine, and I am against others interfering in them. 
  [Starkov] How can the following be combined: reforms and 
minimal losses? 
  [Chernomyrdin] For instance, anybody who is knowledgeable in 
economics realizes that it is impossible to increase the 
production rate when inflation runs high. We have been 
conducting a tight monetary policy and reached a 12 percent 
level of inflation in December 1993. With whichever 
methods--correct or incorrect--we had to bring inflation down, 
and we did so. The subsequent jump in prices in January was a 
result of the fact that our society reacts to everything: 
rumors, any political changes. This causes the ruble rate to 
drop. Besides, January is a special month: many holidays; 
everybody is just beginning to get up to speed. 
  In February inflation slowed down to 9.9 percent, and in 
March it will be 8 percent. But I do not get elated over this. 
Bringing inflation down is not a panacea. Forceful compression 
of the money supply does not solve all the problems. We need not 
only a monetarist, fiscal, so to say, approach; first and 
foremost we need regulators that provide incentives for people 
to work. For that, we need the appropriate laws to exist and 
operate. There should be a normative base for a state 
enterprise, a private or joint-stock one, a farmer, and a 
partnership. 
  The foundation, the basis of our life, is still agriculture. 
The most difficult reforms today are in the agrarian sector. We 
are criticized for them, and we understand that it is fair 
criticism. But we just cannot bring ourselves to take a radical 
step. Of course, God forbid we make a mistake in the disposition 
of land. 
  We recently held for the first time an interesting auction 
in 
Nizhniy Novgorod. Here is the principle that was applied there. 
A kolkhoz was divided; each peasant got his share. They received 
the documents, too. One for material values (a combine, a 
tractor, machinery), and the other for land. Participation in 
the auction was only permitted with these documents, each person 
with his own share. 
  As a result, three leaders emerged. They won the auction and 
began organizing their farms. And each peasant, a former kolkhoz 
member, decided which one to join, to whom to give his documents 
and his share. We now want to take this mechanism as a basis, 
make it part of the national program. We have agreed that if 
Central Russia--Nizhniy Novgorod and Saratov Oblast, Chuvashia, 
and Mordovia--feel that this model is suitable for them, let 
them use it and give it a try. 
  [Starkov] And what do pensioners do, those who no longer 
work? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Pensioners decided on their own which farm 
they wanted to be with. They contribute their share. One of the 
new owners--a young guy, by the way--undertook an obligation to 
provide each pensioner with fuel and three liters of milk daily. 
What this means in a village everybody knows--a comfortable 
life. He leased the pensioners' land. He intends to pay them 
both in money and in-kind. 
  [Starkov] But he will soon start begging the state: "Give me 
money, give me equipment, give me gasoline!" 
  [Chernomyrdin] Well, he is welcome to go and buy it. He 
already has land and equipment today. He can take a loan and pay 
later. He will have to work well. Otherwise life will pull him 
under. 
  [Starkov] And then they will be looking for a new owner? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Maybe they will. But they can also hire 
themselves a manager, even a foreign one. They will pay him, and 
he will organize production working on a contract, for hire. 
  [Starkov] Did Chubays support all this? 
  [Chernomyrdin] He was there with me and supported it. 
  [Starkov] By the way, Luzhkov was here; he just left. He 
does 
not accept "privatization Chubays-style." Whose side are you 
on--Chubays' or Luzhkov's? You probably have to do a balancing 
act. Are they not both close to you? 
  [Chernomyrdin] No matter how good I feel about someone, the 
truth should take precedence in every case. Of course, there is 
only one Moscow. And it is difficult to fit it into some 
blueprint, and it is difficult to get adjusted to it. Conditions 
in the regions are completely different from those in Moscow. 
Without question, under any circumstances Moscow always requires 
a special approach. 
  [Starkov] As probably other major cities? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Precisely. Major centers: Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg... Luzhkov insists 
on conducting privatization for money. Chubays' program is aimed 
at first completing voucher-based privatization, and then begin 
it for money from 1 July. Luzhkov already had small retail 
stores and enterprises privatized. When it came to large 
enterprises, he came to the conclusion that we should not wait 
until 1 July; that even right now, if someone does not have 
enough vouchers, he should be able to buy an enterprise out for 
money. 
  [Starkov] Perhaps this makes sense? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Chubays' line is correct, and I support him. 
And how can I not support my deputy anyway! But I also 
understand Luzhkov: It is an urgent matter. The ZIL [Imeni 
Lenina Automotive Works] or AZLK [Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola 
Automotive Works], for instance... Luzhkov is convinced that the 
money should go into the budget. In this respect I do not agree 
with him. We should not count on this money. It should go to the 
same privatized enterprises--for modernization, reconstruction, 
new technologies. 
  In the final analysis our goal is for the privatized 
enterprise to have a master. It is not important whether it is 
one, or 10, or a collective. The enterprise should start 
working, stop begging, and establish its own channels for both 
sales and material supply. But at the same time save jobs. And 
make competitive products. This is what we want. And this can 
only be done with money. It takes trillions of rubles. This is 
one side of the coin. 
  But there is also another side. It is important who will buy 
a large enterprise. The rich are already standing about ready to 
buy; they are circling like crows. So in this respect Chubays is 
right: Privatization should be done though conversion to 
joint-stock holding, through auctions. To do this, means have to 
be brought together, accumulated, in order to participate in 
privatization for money tomorrow... 
  We also have to be prepared to sell some enterprises, as 
they 
say, "for a consideration of one ruble." For instance, if a 
plant or a factory is very old, and does not have any prospects. 
The Germans are doing this now in East Germany, when there is a 
person who is willing to undertake reconstruction of an old 
enterprise. We set these terms: No layoffs--not even a single 
person; replace all technology after five years; for a period of 
one year continue to produce the current product. If you are 
willing to comply with these terms--take it for "one ruble." 
  [Starkov] So it turns out that privatization is a 
multicolored thing; one blueprint does not work here... 
  [Chernomyrdin] Of course. Next we should not be afraid of 
foreign investors. But we have to start restoring production 
ourselves. Otherwise nobody will come to us. As long as 
foreigners see that we ourselves have not put anything into our 
own production--quite the opposite, put our money in their banks 
rather than ours--they are not going to invest a single penny. 
In time, enterprises may be privatized by foreign buyers as 
well. They will invest their money, modernize them. For us, it 
is important to have jobs, collect taxes, receive income. So 
that people who work well can earn well and live well. Foreign 
investors, if they come along, should invest their money in 
technologies, housing construction, and pull a number of 
productions out of the crisis. Russia does not have the money 
today to do it all on its own. 
  There have been reports recently, including in ARGUMENTY I 
FAKTY, that Chernomyrdin hands money out right and left. Where 
does this come from? Let us look at the situation with miners. 
You cannot say that they are wrong. I do not want to say that 
only we are right and they are wrong. Unfortunately, we still 
have not closed unprofitable mines from which we have long been 
receiving nothing. 
  [Starkov] The situation is similar to that which existed in 
England under Margaret Thatcher. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Yes, over there the miners were on strike for 
a year, but the mines were nevertheless closed. I would rather 
not see the conflict here reach this sort of tension. But there 
is a program to close 11 mines this year. Money should be 
appropriated to support those who work there. There should be an 
employment program for those laid off. Those left without jobs 
should receive benefits. People need to be retrained. We have 
built these expenditures into the budget. 
  [Starkov] Still, what are you going to do about the miners 
now? Their demands are justified. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Wages have to be paid under any 
circumstances. 
If an enterprise operates, if people work, if we have not found 
another solution--we have to pay. But the coal industry workers 
say that they need 11.8 trillion rubles [R] in subsidies. The 
Ministry of Finance figured R5.7 trillion. But they are 
demanding precisely R11.8 trillion! 
  The government decided to increase the subsidy to R7.8 
trillion. Let us start from there, and then we will see. I am 
not saying: You will get nothing, and that is it! But to go on 
strike to get precisely what they themselves have calculated 
(although there is no proof that they are correct)--this is 
wrong. 
  [Starkov] But where are you going to get these trillions? 
The 
army wants money, culture wants money, pensioners want money. 
And you have to give it to them! The way I see it, this 
situation can drive you to despair! 
  [Chernomyrdin] What we need is an honest, realistic budget. 
How many versions of it have we had! For the first time now the 
Ministry of Finance did this immense job on its own. 
  [Starkov] Did you get a budget that is more economic than 
political? 
  [Chernomyrdin] We agreed at the outset to make as realistic 
a 
budget as possible. Enough lies. The budget came out with a 
substantial deficit. How do we cover it? Some things can still 
be changed within the budget, shifted between line items. I can 
see it. A few days ago we received the forecast for this year's 
prices. It was prepared by the Ministry of the Economy. And we 
saw once again that we could have approached it differently. In 
order to get R120 trillion in revenue, you have to work very 
hard. Not cry or whine. All mechanisms have to work, including 
the tax system. We have to create opportunities for effective 
domestic and foreign economic activities. Put everything at 
stake to make the economy work. As to the R62 trillion deficit, 
it has to be covered somehow. 
  [Starkov] How? 
  [Chernomyrdin] The difference between expenses (R180 
trillion 
with some "kopeks") and revenue, that is, the R62 trillion 
deficit, we will cover with Central Bank credits, and the 
rest--with income from foreign economic activities. We will 
trade more, earn more abroad, drag foreign currency in here, and 
hopefully cover this deficit. 
  [Starkov] Now I want to ask you about taxes. One businessman 
of my acquaintance told me that he has to pay a 113 percent tax 
if he does everything honestly and by the law. How can he live, 
how will he develop his own production? 
  [Chernomyrdin] This is a serious problem. Both the president 
and the government have decided that the tax policy needs 
improvement; we, on the other hand, have slammed everyone with a 
23 percent value-added tax. The tax policy should stimulate 
production instead of tying it down. By the way, your 
businessman friend is maybe telling the truth, except that the 
truth here is somewhat bent. He was talking about the sum of 
expenses, including taxes. The net tax should amount to 58-62 
kopeks per ruble. I am talking, of course, about a theoretical 
ruble. A person buys materials, pays salaries--this takes 
another 40 kopeks out of each ruble. Those who can manage on 40 
kopeks are all right, but some cannot make it even on 60 kopeks. 
This is how you get 113 percent. Bad as our system is, it will 
not permit in principle 92 kopeks out of a ruble to go for 
taxes. Although it is true that our tax system does not work 
correctly everywhere. And when we measure everyone with the same 
yardstick, some do indeed jump over 100 percent. On the other 
hand, you can inflate salaries so much that no tax system will 
sustain it. But if you want to have a life of luxury--and we 
cannot prohibit anyone to have a life of luxury--then, of 
course, you cannot fit into that ruble. 
  [Starkov] The government recently introduced customs duties 
for foodstuffs. Do you believe this was a correct decision? 
Luzhkov says that this will lead to a sharp rise in food prices. 
  [Chernomyrdin] In market economy countries the most powerful 
lever in the hands of the state is custom duties. Many economic 
processes can be regulated this way, The easiest thing is to 
open borders and flood the country with cheap cars, clothing, 
and food--good or bad. And I would quickly become popular. We 
would have lasted a year. We have a different approach, however. 
What are we to do with our goods? We cannot strangle our own 
producer. This is impermissible; this means death. Such things 
have already happened in history, when everything was ruined. We 
need to buy foodstuffs in Tver and Orel... 
  Right now, for instance, warehouses in Orel or Krasnodar 
Kray 
are filled to capacity with meat and butter--we can no longer 
tolerate this. They are begging: Take the products. 
  Of course, the production cost of our product is much 
higher; 
not all mechanisms are working here yet. But we are not going to 
solve all these problems overnight. Therefore, overall we are 
not going to give up on custom duties. Although some things will 
be adjusted. 
  [Starkov] So there are indeed some mistakes in this? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Probably. Perhaps we should reduce custom 
duties on foodstuffs going to major cities--for instance, 
Moscow. The president also disagreed with higher custom duties 
on children's clothing. I do not think either that our children 
are all that spoiled. Let those who can afford it buy imported 
goods for them. We will not spare anything for the children, 
until we ourselves learn to live nicely. 
  [Starkov] Is it not going to happen that all these new 
custom 
duties will result in even greater price increases for food? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Of course, we are protecting first and 
foremost the Russian producer, but we do warn them: If some get 
out of line and begin to raise prices, they will get different 
customs duties, much lower, and then they will have to compete 
very seriously with imports. 
  [Starkov] We can see from letters to the editors that people 
expect calm. The country has been upside down for too long. We 
need a working period. 
  [Chernomyrdin] The task we have set for ourselves is to calm 
the country--politically and economically, without clamor, 
shouting, and emotions. We are not doing it for ourselves. We 
are doing it for Russia. I could probably convince the president 
now to get more loans. But this is mortally dangerous for 
Russia. Therefore, tough measures are necessary. We may make 
mistakes. But I believe in moving forward, even if mistakes are 
made in the process. It is better to correct them as we go. If 
we made a mistake with custom duties--we will correct it. But at 
least we will know where we have made a mistake, and tomorrow we 
will not make it. To sit and wait, doing nothing and being 
afraid, is to get nowhere. Then it is better not to be prime 
minister. 
  There was all this clamor a year ago: We are facing a 
famine. 
We will not be hungry. We are not a poor country. We ourselves 
have made it poor. Russia, with its immense potential, should 
not live from hand to mouth. Be rich in fuel and freeze; be rich 
in grain and starve. 
  True, there are some who want it to happen--for us to be 
weak, so that we could be taken from any side and dismembered. 
They do not want to see one whole Russia, a strong Russia. 
  [Starkov] Do you think that some accord is emerging in 
society after all? 
  [Chernomyrdin] We find understanding with many people. For 
instance, it is much easier now to work with the Duma leadership 
than it was with the old Supreme Soviet. I can see that the Duma 
now is shifting to more constructive work. At least the 
government now feels its support. Take, for instance, the same 
budget: I am certain that we will make adjustments to it 
together, but we will also answer for it together. This does not 
mean that I want to shift the responsibility onto someone else. 
But the Duma will know, too, what to ask from us. 
  [Starkov] I get the feeling from everything you say lately 
that you seem to argue constantly with an invisible opponent. I 
also feel something between the lines here. Please explain what 
is happening. 
  [Chernomyrdin] I am disgusted with the hoopla around me. Can 
you seriously consider that I, in my position of head of the 
government, would think about running for president in 1996 and 
waste time on political squabbles?! All you need to do is spend 
time with me, sit at my desk by my side, live my life, to 
understand me better. I do not want and do not intend to run for 
president. And anyway, I consider it unethical to talk on this 
subject with the live president who has two years to go on his 
term. And I still have to survive until 1996! 
  Those who do not have responsibility for anything--they can 
wait. They have time and no responsibility. Nobody holds them to 
answer for anything; they do nothing other than prepare 
themselves for the presidency. Well, this is their right. If 
someone believes that the life of the president or the prime 
minister is all sweetness and light, that anyone can do it just 
like that--let them try. 
  Right now we really have to balance on a tightrope. Any 
wrong 
step upsets the people. Any wrong decision in financial policy, 
in economic matters, also makes them nervous. Give a bit more to 
anyone--inflation will kill you right away. Tighten the screws 
more--production will grind to a halt, and the entire country 
with it. 
  First and foremost, I urge everyone to reach an accord. 
Sometimes I get the impression that someone wants us not to 
work. But we cannot allow it. And I want to tell you in all 
seriousness--I will not be distracted. 
  [Starkov] During the sad October events you took a 
principled 
position, which earned you increased respect. How do you feel 
now, though, having your office in this building? Will the White 
House finally stop being a haunted place? Are you going to move 
from here? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Absolutely not. We have fixed the White House 
and are convinced that it will not become "black" again. I am 
certain that it will become a House of Business People, where 
important and needed decisions are made.

<F P=106> [Text of the political statement on the creation of the </F>
Russia's Choice Party] 
  [Text] Russia is living through one of the most dramatic 
periods in its history. There is a real threat of a nomenklatura 
revanche and of national extremists and undisguised fascists 
coming into power. 
  Russia has no future unless reforms are continued, norms of 
a 
civil society reinforced, and economic and political stability 
ensured. 
  We can no longer tolerate the fact that the disciplined 
forces of reaction and revanche are opposed by a fractured and 
amorphous democratic movement. Therefore, we undertake to 
build an organized political force--a party of stability, order, 
and reforms. 
  Russia's Choice is for a free society, where human rights 
constitute the highest priority and are securely protected; 
where authority is limited by law, and the law itself is fair 
and is observed unfailingly. 
  Russia's Choice is a party of stability. Protection of 
ownership rights and bringing down inflation are the foremost 
conditions for economic growth in our and your country. 
  Russia's Choice is for a state that is effective but not 
burdensome for taxpayers. We are against the omnipotence of 
bureaucrats, who reward themselves with wealth and privileges. 
  Russia's Choice is for a Great Russia, occupying its proper 
place in the world community. 
  Russia's Choice is a party of peace. We intend to resist any 
attempts to plunge the country into military adventures. We are 
for peace and accord in the Russian society. 
  We urge everyone who is inspired by these goals and ideas to 
join the Russia's Choice Party. An organizational congress will 
be held within the next few months.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Katayev, deputy of the Moscow City Duma </F>
and cochairman of the Moscow branch of Democratic Russia: "A New 
Half for the New Course."] 
  [Text] The formation and 
self-government of trade unions is impossible without political 
support. So in this article we shall talk about democratic 
parties and movements. No matter what they are--"dishevelled or 
clumsy" like all of Russia--they already mean quite a lot in 
real life. Let us take a look at how the future of the largest 
of them, the Democratic Russia (DR) movement, is taking shape. 
  DR is the only all-Russia, mass, democratic political 
organization that was not created by a leader, but was organized 
from below by uniting many initiative groups in nearly every 
region of Russia. This is why its policy toward reform is 
stable, a policy that has survived two sets of deputies, several 
governments, and several policies of the President of Russia. 
During the 1989 and 1990 elections, the predecessors of 
Democratic Russia won the elections, and during the presidential 
elections and the April 1993 referendum the DR policy won out in 
Moscow and in the largest cities. 
  DR is the only democratic organization capable of calling 
for 
a mass meeting. The most important work of DR, however, is 
practically unknown to the public. This work included the very 
difficult and thankless task of DR factions opposing the 
majority in former Soviets; conducting deputy activities in 
okrugs; formulating a law on privatization, struggling for 
privatization with the directing staff of the Supreme Soviet, 
and achieving a compromise on privatization; struggling with 
officials for civilized privatization, instead of the one which 
is often harsh and leads to court cases; and fighting much more 
effectively than many other parties that are keen on 
privatization. 
  Naturally this is why political opponents have directed 
their 
fire on Democratic Russia. Some "buried" us, not noticing the 
true state of affairs, effusively described splits (Wouldn't we 
be great if we had not parted with Travkin, Aksyuchits, and 
Astafyev!). Others called us the ruling party and held us 
responsible for all past misfortunes. They placed us in the same 
ranks with extremists. They blamed us for reckless support of 
the government. 
  Does DR still exist and whom does it represent? Is 
Democratic 
Russia's participation in the Vybor Rossii (VR) [Russia's 
Choice] bloc an error or a necessity? How should DR approach the 
very necessary union of democratic forces? What should DR's 
position be with regard to the Russia's Choice bloc and to the 
party organized by its leadership? 
  In May 1993, A. Murashev, A. Golovkov, and member of the 
Coordinating Council (CC) of Democratic Russia P. Fillipov 
conducted a campaign out in the regions against the cochairmen 
and the CC of Democratic Russia. They spread rumors about DR's 
degradation, but embraced its organizational structure with all 
their hearts. Everything would have been normal if they had been 
guided by the charter on reelections within DR. However, they 
won over people and entire organizations to their side, tempting 
them with promises of assistance from the directors of 
administration and the President's representatives. 
  June. The inevitability of early elections was obvious and 
the unity of democrats was essential. Upon the initiative of 
DR's cochairmen, the formation of "Russia's Choice" bloc was 
proclaimed. Those who had been talking against Democratic Russia 
turned up as well, not in leading positions, but nonetheless in 
key positions. However, there was still hope that common sense 
would prevail, as would the authority of the bloc leaders: Ye. 
Gaydar and S. Kovalev. Does this mean that Democratic Russia 
should have gone out on its own, by itself? No! Accusations of 
fomenting a split would have poured in. 
  October had already come. Less than two months remained 
before the elections. Democratic Russia organizations in Moscow 
and Petersburg stood their ground. In many other regions they 
fell apart, and organizations of Russia's Choice movement--with 
large losses of members--were formed out of what was left. In 
some regions, Russia's Choice and Democratic Russia movements 
organized Democratic Russia blocs; in others (Chelyabinsk and 
Novosibirsk), they were fighting each other. The organizers of 
the founding congress of Russia's Choice bloc, using 
apparatchiks' methods, secured a majority for themselves and 
demonstratively tried to squeeze Democratic Russia out of the 
bloc. They were still in a state of euphoria from their October 
"victory" and from the pre-election polls. A mixture of snobbery 
and unprofessionalism is deadly for politicians and prevented 
them from understanding that Democratic Russia's scandalous 
departure would lead to the defeat of not only DR, but the rest 
of the bloc as well. DR, however, understood this, absorbed the 
degradation, and did not leave the bloc. Representatives of 
Democratic Russia made a two-hour stand at the front entrance of 
the congress hall and "participated" in the work of the congress 
using guest passes.... As was to be expected, the federal list 
of the bloc did not leave any spaces for DR leaders. Many people 
in DR still remember that congress as the most degrading 
experience in their lives. 
  November. Candidates were being selected in the majority 
okrugs. Of course, the executive committee of the bloc was 
obliged to take into consideration the interests of all bloc 
participants. But, for the sake of satisfying them, can regional 
organizations be saddled with deliberately unacceptable 
candidates and provoke these organizations into a fight with the 
bloc? It is true that there is one objective justification to 
the arbitrariness of the bloc's leadership--the most terrible 
time factor. 
  December. The majority of Democratic Russia's territorial 
organizations, knowing the true situation within the bloc, were 
still pressing for DR candidates, because the alternative would 
have been defeat for the democrats. Also, many candidates were 
still our own people, and many who had been "let go from up 
above" were not bad at all. As always, fresh forces joined DR 
organizations during the critical moments and saved its ability 
to function. People who were hit the hardest by reforms, who 
bore the brunt of the disintegration of science and industry, 
and who did not receive any pay for months at a time were the 
ones who agitated for reforms, passed out leaflets, and 
volunteered as observers at polling places. Small businessmen, 
crushed by racketeers and taxes, and who long ago parted with 
their illusions of a "democratic" administration, contributed 
funds in support of Russia's Choice. Now these are the real 
intelligentsia, the gold reserve of democracy! 
  As long as people like this exist, Democratic Russia will 
exist and will have the honor to represent them! 
  On the eve of the elections, however, A. Murashev, wasted 
his 
journalistic fire not against Zhirinovskiy or Zyuganov, but 
against the people who were his allies in the bloc: "Actually, 
DR has already completely degenerated. It consists of marginal 
groups without any local support whatsoever.... The people who 
have remained there are not wanted by anyone else; they are 
inadequate and useless. Incidentally, many of them had been in 
important organizations, but were removed either for 
malfeasance, poor work, or unprofessionalism" (NOVOYE VREMYA No. 
46, November 1993). There is no doubt that personnel in 
Democratic Russia are very varied not only in the different 
regions, but also in the different districts of Moscow. There 
are "marginal" people. But are we going to give them to 
Zhirinovskiy? No one has the right to offend people, especially 
the "removed" chief of Moscow's Main Directorate of Internal 
Affairs and failed candidate for cochairmanship of DR. The 
executive committee and the leaders of Russia's Choice bloc, 
however, have not found the time to tell him "fie on you," not 
even very softly. 
  Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, as well as Popov, are like the 
generals 
in the film about Fanfan the Tulip who turned their backs to the 
enemy. So is it any wonder that in leaving DR, the participants 
of the movement did not go to Murashev? Or that leaving Gaydar, 
the voters did not go to Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, or Popov? The 
humbled and the insulted: Some with their professional 
unwantedness and poverty that contradict all common sense, and 
others with their cynicism and demogoguery of democrats. Some 
wandered over to Zhirinovskiy, others sent everyone to .... 
  In the post-election hysterics, everyone is silent about the 
fact that in Moscow and Petersburg and other large cities the 
democrats won again. In Moscow, the Russia's Choice slate won 34 
percent of the votes and all the democratic slates won 54 
percent, while the red-brown candidates won 24. In elections to 
the State Duma, Russia's Choice won in 11 majority okrugs out of 
15 in the capital; to the municipal Duma--19 out of 35; and in 
those okrugs where Russia's Choice lost, democrats still won 
nearly everywhere. Moscow voters have nothing to be sorry about. 
  But now that the elections are over, shouldn't Democratic 
Russia leave the bloc? No! Factions in the State and Moscow 
Dumas cannot be destroyed. The romantic times are over when we 
divided people into bad bolsheviks and good democrats. Russia's 
Choice movement is our ally not because of the personal 
attributes of the leaders, but because of the political niche 
Russia's Choice occupies. 
  As long as Ye. Gaydar determined the government's policy, 
his 
actions responded to the strategic interests of the country. In 
the present situation, government actions respond mainly to the 
interests of large monopoly capital emanating from officialdom 
and "directors'" circles. These are also the interests of 
Russia's Choice movement, perhaps with great support from 
officialdom. If Russia's Choice bloc had won the elections and 
formed the government, Democratic Russia would probably have 
distanced itself from Russia's Choice, in order to defend 
anti-monopoly measures and the interests of the intelligentsia 
and small and medium-sized business. The difference between 
social support of Russia's Choice and Democratic Russia has 
washed away and is not always realized; it feeds the 
disagreements between them. But now the government is inclined 
to lean on the huge capital that comes from the CPSU, 
monopolies, and "red landowners." Both Russia's Choice and 
Democratic Russia showed up in their roles of opposition, and 
they are trying not to give the government totally away to left 
radicals. 
  One important result of the past electoral campaign: The 
rank-and-file members of Democratic Russia showed a conscious 
need for better organization. The word "party" still causes some 
to have an allergic reaction, but the essence, after all, does 
not lie in the word itself. The uncertainty existing within DR 
with regard to membership is already recognized as an 
anachronism. It has become clear that it is weakening the 
movement, and at the same time does not lead to democracy within 
the movement (as it seemed to do earlier), but on the contrary, 
gives free play to apparatchik games. Let us say that a chairman 
is elected by an organization with an undetermined number of 
members by random (or selected) members during a meeting. If the 
organization has a fixed membership, a real majority elects him. 
Membership dues are also considered necessary. 
  The time for Democratic Russia's reorganization has come. On 
February 19th the plenum of Democratic Russia's Council of 
Representatives approved these recommendations for the regional 
organizations. It is possible that this action, and not the 
arguments about forming a party, was the main result of this 
plenum. 
  The attitude of Democratic Russia's plenum toward the 
proposal of Russia's Choice parliamentary faction to create a 
united party was not monosemantic. No one denied the necessity, 
in principle, of forming a party. But how does one do it? The 
way is direct and obvious: Dissolve Democratic Russia and 
Russia's Choice, and charter a party. The authority of Russia's 
Choice leadership, however, was undermined by a feeble 
pre-election campaign, and the crushing of Democratic Russia in 
the regions, and insulting it at the congress. Apprehensions are 
strong that local officials--on whom Russia's Choice now depends 
and with whom there is now a tough struggle prior to elections 
to local organs of power--will crush Democratic Russia and 
furthermore, will compromise the organization to the voters. 
  Should a party be formed without Democratic Russia or 
Russia's Choice? Such a party would draw the activists out of 
Democratic Russia, totally tie it up with a neo-nomenklatura and 
quickly degenerate. Democratic Russia, then, devoid of activist 
members, would also quickly disintegrate. If, however, the 
activists would simultaneously remain in Democratic Russia, its 
fate would be the same as that of a trade union led by the CPSU. 
  Either of these choices, and even raising questions about 
them, are fraught with the danger of splits and losses of 
members. 
  It is simply unprofessional to try to create a mass 
organization from above. Futile are the hopes for a new personal 
party that would be free of the usual shortcomings. Therefore, 
my esteemed gentlemen, if you think of yourselves as candidates 
for political leadership positions, work in your existing 
organizations, reorganize, attract new people into it, and play 
on your team and win. 
  At the same time, in my opinion, no leader has yet grown up 
in the Russian political elite who would be capable of heading a 
mass democratic organization in a professional manner. The last 
several months have shown this especially clearly. The present 
leading politicians have become too accustomed to being locked 
into a tight circle. Democratic Russia scares them with real and 
imagined shortcomings and a somewhat scandalous image. If, 
however, they are ready to join Democratic Russia, they try to 
gain leadership positions without having done anything either in 
Democratic Russia or for Democratic Russia. They are 
characterized by their inability to obtain support of mass 
organizations (not only at critical times, but every day, 
constantly), make use of the extensive information these 
organizations have, respect their opinions, and show concern for 
their material and intellectual resources, and their authority. 
  In my view, if a party is to be formed, it should be formed 
within Democratic Russia but, of course, not repulse those who 
do not want to join. This would not require large organizational 
efforts and would not disrupt Democratic Russia's present 
political work in the regions. 
  Unfortunately, a large part of Democratic Russia's 
leadership 
does not want this. The possible reason is that now, after a 
lack of success during the elections and in relations with 
Russia's Choice, the majority of the members of the Coordinating 
Council and the cochairmen would probably be replaced, 
regardless of whether they were personally at fault. These are 
smart and active people who cannot go into the shadows and who 
are already tied into forming a parallel party. In other words, 
they are behaving in the same way as the founders of Russia's 
Choice movement behaved only recently. 
  Democratic Russia also has many other vitally important 
problems. It is time, finally, to acquire buildings, finances, 
and a newspaper. We need working groups and seminars to develop 
programs, tactics, solutions to regional problems, reforms, etc. 
At one time we relied on an interregional group, then on 
councils, and then on the President and the government. It is 
now clear that without a material and intellectual economic 
base, Democratic Russia will remain an errand boy for whoever 
will condescend to go down to the poverty-stricken movement. 
  Money is needed for all this, not only three days before 
elections, but constantly. Money can be given only by 
businessmen who are interested in stability, a normal social 
climate, an open market for real estate, and control over 
racketeering by officials. Businessmen's specialty is to make 
money, not politics. Politicians whom they trust should decide 
which organization should get the money. 
  Resolving these problems will also have an influence on 
whether Democratic Russia will be able to form blocs with others 
without self-destructing (and it is necessary to form blocs) and 
whether it can, in an extreme case, go into the next All-Russia 
elections independently. To enter into blocs and alliances 
either as a strong unified force or as a scattered force and 
lose half your people are the only alternatives, not only for 
Democratic Russia, but for the entire democratic movement. 
  The time of revolutionary romanticism has ended. 
  We no longer idealize each other, the deputies, the 
government, the President, or Russia. 
  At the same time it has become clear that the opportunities 
for state power in a democratic society are limited. No one can 
or should have "all the power." This is bad. After all, one 
really wants to win elections and improve society with one 
swoop! This is good and necessary because it excludes cataclysms 
and abuse of power even by legitimate authorities. What 
government cannot and should not do can be done by society 
itself within the possibilities granted it by organizations from 
below. 
  In our country, however, democratic limitations of power 
have 
been imposed by degrading authoritative and power organizations, 
due to corruption, unprofessional conduct, and poverty. All 
hopes rest on bringing reforms down to the ordinary citizen, and 
on his interest and active work, for attaining a structured 
society. All this, notwithstanding our tiredness and poverty.

<F P=106> [Article by Marina Shakina, under the "Political Life" </F>
rubric: "Will Valeriy Zorkin Become a Candidate for President? 
Perhaps He Will Indeed Become a Candidate, but 
President--Hardly"] 
  [Text] One of the most fascinating occupations engaged in 
by people who take an interest in politics is calculating who 
will attempt to become president in the next presidential 
elections. 
  Recently, rumors have circulated that Ilya Konstantinov was 
preparing to embark upon this arduous path and that he was 
planning to take with him for company Valeriy Zorkin, former 
chairman of the Constitutional Court. 
  The team of rivals inclined to fight for the presidency has 
more or less been formed. The only ones who are still holding 
back with their bids are the "die-hards"--Yeltsin, Gorbachev, 
Chernomyrdin. But the rest are "pawing the ground." Yavlinskiy, 
Zhirinovskiy, Shakhray, Rutskoy, Gaydar, Travkin.... Generally 
speaking, one can put on the list any Russian politician who is 
the slightest bit famous--you will not go wrong. 
  Judging by everything, at the presidential elections the 
situation be a repeat of that before 12 December--no general 
candidates, no one will yield to anyone and withdraw their 
candidacy for the benefit of a more popular like-minded 
candidate, everyone for himself. If there are many candidates, 
that means that there is no generally accepted leader. If there 
are many claimants, that means that there is not one, after all. 
<H5>  His Favorite Clothing--the Peacemaker's Toga </H5>
  Valeriy Zorkin is in an unusual position. He is one of the 
few whose name is at this point not associated with one of the 
parties, and not even with a political force. Although a fairly 
wide spectrum of parties considers him one of their own. But 
right now he is not interested in them, but on the contrary, 
they in him. 
  During the period of the parliamentary election campaign, he 
received offers to be entered on the election lists of Civic 
Union, Aksyuchits' Christian-democratic movement, and the 
Agrarian Party. But he, thanking everyone for the honor, 
declined the offers, since he was still a member of the 
Constitutional Court. 
  Today his name is being counted upon by Ilya Konstantinov, 
who has been freed from Lefortovo and has conceived the plan to 
resurrect the National Salvation Front. And in principle, this 
fact evokes no surprise. If we recall the recent past, the 
National Salvation Front should be experiencing a special 
feeling of gratitude toward Valeriy Zorkin. 
  After all, in its time, the Constitutional Court, under 
Zorkin's leadership, declared unconstitutional the edict of the 
president that banned this same front. Of course, Zorkin 
considers that this gratitude is inappropriate--he was only 
carrying out his duty, checking the actions of the president 
with the Constitution. But nevertheless, the front owes its 
existence to the Constitutional Court and its former chairman. 
  Is Valeriy Zorkin himself up on these plans for the future? 
He declares that he is not. "I am flattered, it is an honor for 
me, that Konstantinov has raised me to his level.... But for me, 
this is a complete surprise." 
  Of course, these self-abasing curtsies to Konstantinov and 
his "level" should not be taken literally--Valeriy Zorkin is 
simply a very well-bred and modest person. It seems to me that 
he would answer any offer in this way, regardless from whom it 
came. Or not? 
  Valeriy Zorkin was always not simply a jurist, not simply a 
judge, not simply the chairman of the Constitutional Court, but 
a man endowed with a political temperament. The role of the 
chairman of the Constitutional Court, to which he came as a 
result of purely political actions--an expert of the 
Constitutional Commission, an elaborator of the law on the 
Constitutional Court--was, as is now seen perfectly distinctly, 
always perceived by him as a political post. 
<H5>  The Judge of All </H5>
  The thesis of the political sterility of constitutional 
judges seemed to many a bit of craftiness about which it was 
indecent to speak aloud. With tacit silence, everyone pretended 
that, yes indeed, the court is outside of politics. 
  But admit it, if you become judge of the president and 
of the deputies, if you have the right to tell the head of 
state, "You are wrong," or if you do the same with regard to 
those elected by the people, and if your decision is not subject 
to discussion, then that elevates you in your own eyes and even 
makes you sort of their equal. It is an insidious thing, 
judging. How sweet for an untempered man.... 
  Without a doubt, this role was very, very much to Valeriy 
Zorkin's taste. He considered it his calling--not calling in our 
everyday vernacular, which has lost its innermost, sacral sense 
and signifies only a talent, an inclination for something. But 
Calling with a capital C, that is, a concept from among the 
class of divine categories, a manifestation of a higher will. 
  Valeriy Zorkin does not particularly conceal that he 
believes 
in divine providence and that today he has not drawn back from 
politics but cocks his ear to fate. He is frozen in 
expectation--how will his life be ordered? 
  It is partly from this--the man does not belong to himself 
and does not himself choose a path for himself--that his passive 
position also results. Zorkin considers it unacceptable to offer 
himself and his name to various political forces and to engage 
in trade with the aim of reaching the highest quotation of his 
own political stock. 
  So, judging from everything, Zorkin perceived the role of 
the 
chairman of the Constitutional Court as a calling also to embody 
a measure of morality in politics. He saw himself not as a 
political leader, but as a spiritual one, as a person who shows 
what is good and what is bad, with everyone hearkening to 
him.... A judge and a spiritual authority are two incompatible 
things. A spiritual leader is strong not in the lines of a 
verdict, but in the entire scope of his personality. 
  It cannot be denied that Zorkin did not attempt--I do not 
even know how to say this--to acquire, to play, to imitate this 
scope of personality. In general, to be at the level of the 
ideal that lived in his soul. But the results would hardly 
convince even him himself. And he is hardly to blame for this. 
<H5>  Piecemeal Centrism </H5>
  The fact is that, for reasons of the most objective of 
circumstances of political life, the perfectly honorable role of 
peacemaker that he chose was an absolute failure. During 
Zorkin's tenure as chairman of the Constitutional Court, events 
developed according to a confrontational scenario, and not 
because of the perniciousness of the interested parties 
(although this was also present to a small degree), but by 
virtue of the fact that the political opponents were striving 
for opposite and incompatible things. 
  Even if civil peace was, at great effort, preserved, there 
was no peace in hearts and minds. And there is none now. And to 
represent the matter as such that we will take a little bit from 
the leftists and a little bit from the rightists, and we will 
have centrism and political splendor--that is either uncommon 
naivete or conscious game-playing. Zorkin is not the only one 
who has been caught up in this. 
  But it is not just that the role of peacemaker is not yet a 
timely one in our country, and therefore, it cannot be crowned 
with success. Zorkin was not even able to create the image of a 
peacemaker. 
  Zorkin demonstrated exceeding verbosity, fussiness, 
partiality, and involvement in conflict. He remained 
simultaneously judge to the president and the deputies, judge to 
himself, and a sort of head of a "quick reaction" corps in the 
development of the political situation. And for that reason, he 
very quickly began to be used toward political ends. 
  Contradictory ambition led to Zorkin's getting embroiled up 
to his ears in political squabbles of the day, and he began to 
play a strange role--something like a pawn in other people's 
hands, something like a typical representative of the restless 
intelligentsia, which is eternally afraid of everything, can 
never decide to do anything, and strives to dump this decision 
in someone else's lap. 
  The position of a peacemaker both before the referendum and 
in October could have been the same--a call to all the 
participating sides: "Refrain from violence at any cost." A 
political peacemaker, a spiritual leader, even a simple 
politician (but a politician!) should think about to 
what, to which consequences, his decision, his word, his 
action, will lead. A judge should not. 
  What am I leading up to? To the fact that Zorkin is not this 
nor that nor the other--not a peacemaker, not a spiritual 
leader, and not a politician. He is a very capable, qualified 
jurist with a striking need for self-expression and 
self-assertion. With certain huge ambitions that are eroded, not 
concrete, but lying more in the realm of politics. Are these 
ambitions fated to be realized? It would not seem so. 
<H5>  Outside of Realism. That Is Typical </H5>
  Why? The opinions of Valeriy Zorkin on politics create the 
impression of being too banal, declarative, and abstract. 
  For example, Zorkin is convinced of the necessity for the 
creation of a broad centrist coalition, which could include (if 
we orient ourselves on the Duma factions) communists, agrarians, 
a segment of Yavlinskiy's bloc, part of Shakhray's party, and 
Travkin's party. And Baburin and his group, too. This coalition 
will create a government that will lead the country out of the 
blind alley into which it was led by Yeltsin, Gaydar, and their 
like. 
  It is completely unnecessary to hand out posts to Travkin, 
Lapshin, and Shakhray (who is not doing without as it is, 
incidentally) in order to see that this will change nothing. In 
this sense, Chernomyrdin's government is ideologically a 
completely coalition one. It includes representatives of 
Shakhray's party and of the agrarians and of the communists. 
  "If you promised the people something and you were not able 
to come through, then retire, let someone else try," Zorkin says 
to the democrats, forgetting that Gaydar has in fact left and 
that everything that is happening today in the economy is 
happening without his participation, and Yeltsin's term expires 
only in 1996 and there is no reason for him to step down 
sooner--even according to the Constitution, which we all, taking 
our lead from the constitutional judges, honor. 
  And besides, it was precisely Yeltsin who formed the 
currently working, essentially coalition government, of whose 
necessity Gennadiy Zyuganov and Valeriy Zorkin are constantly 
talking. 
  Valeriy Zorkin considers the main task of state power to be 
the struggle against corruption, which the president has 
promised to conduct; meanwhile, the corruption has not been done 
away with.... Well, what can one say to that? That the coalition 
government will not be able to do away with it either, and, in 
order to be convinced of this there is no need to experiment 
with ministers? 
  That we will not be able to triumph over corruption, but 
only 
to localize it, when a civil society, a stable multiparty 
system, and an effective economy are created? And to "triumph 
over" corruption is possible only with universal repressions, 
and even then.... 
  Finally, that it is not the president who fights corruption, 
but the security organs, the procuracy, and the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, which are demonstrating no inclination to 
engage seriously in this? Incidentally speaking, the security 
organs, the procuracy, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are 
completely "coalition," because they are composed of those same 
people who were there under Soviet power. 
<H5>  There Are Also Those Who Are `More Ours' </H5>
  The Constitutional Court now finds itself in a strange 
position. The former law is not in effect, but the Duma is 
wrapping up the draft of the new one with unmitigated 
stubbornness. In the court, the matter is represented in such a 
way that neither the president nor the deputies need the 
Constitutional Court--it will just get underfoot in the coming 
slingfest. 
  Valeriy Zorkin, however, acknowledges that "while the 
volcano 
continues to erupt," perhaps there really is no sense in the 
Constitutional Court's beginning to work--the legal grounds have 
not yet become set, one edict supersedes another, and the Duma 
still has not managed to adopt a single law, and therefore ought 
to feel uncomfortable in front of the Constitutional Court. 
  Will he be able to satisfy his thirst for self-realization 
in 
such a court? And the answer suggests itself of its own accord: 
No. Most likely, he will also not be able to withdraw into the 
quiet of a judge's chambers. And he himself will not be able to. 
  Zorkin does not want to guess at future events. But, most 
likely, his name will be uttered more than once toward the 
presidential and parliamentary elections. He hardly has a 
serious chance at the presidency--one would think that he is an 
intelligent person and understands that himself, although 
perhaps in his heart he cannot agree with such a fate. 
  The voters are unlikely to evaluate his moral castings in 
the 
field of politics--for many people, after his chairman's epic he 
is "neither fish nor fowl" and you cannot figure out what he 
wants; for others, he is an apostate; for others, maybe he is in 
fact "one of ours," but there are those who are "more ours." 
  But Zorkin could perfectly well become an independent and 
fairly influential deputy. If that will satisfy him.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduard Limonov, chief grenade launcher of NOVYY </F>
VZGLYAD: "A Hand Grenade for Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy the Immigrant </H5>
  "Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the ultra-nationalist and winner of 
the Russian elections, could have been an Israeli citizen." 
Baruch Gur, a leader of the Jewish Agency responsible for the 
immigration to Israel of Jews from the USSR, declared on Sunday 
(26 December) that Zhirinovskiy, who is today considered a 
well-known anti-Semite, once took steps to emigrate to Israel. 
The leader of the nationalists forwarded papers confirming that 
his father, Volf by name, had been a Jew. "It was perfectly 
clear that his father was a Jew," Mr. Gur confirmed. "In 1980 V. 
Zhirinovskiy was an active member of the Shalom Jewish culture 
group and he worked actively in a group of Soviet Zionists up to 
1989, that is, two years before offering himself at the Russian 
presidential elections in 1991." I came across this piece in the 
very popular newspaper LE PARISIEN in the issue for 28 December 
last. The piece is headed "ZHIRINOVSKIY WANTED TO EMIGRATE TO 
ISRAEL." 
  On 29 December this same piece (its source is a REUTERS 
dispatch: "Interview With Baruch Gur in Israel") was published 
by LE MONDE. The LE MONDE version specifies that Zhirinovskiy 
"took the first steps toward emigration to the Jewish state in 
1983." In the evening of 3 January, in response to the question 
put directly by the anchor of French Television's Channel 1: 
"Was your father a Jew? You wanted to leave for Israel?" 
Zhirinovskiy declined to answer. 
  This news left French public opinion, the "right," 
thunderstruck. I confess that I myself am catching it now for it 
was I who had taken it upon myself to introduce Zhirinovskiy to 
the French right and had organized his meeting with Jean-Marie 
Le Pen, president of the National Front, in September 1992. 
Censure has been rained down on me for the fact that I 
introduced to their environment "a Jew posing as a Nazi." While 
leaving this definition to the conscience of my accusers, I am 
forced to agree that a Jew masquerading as a Russian nationalist 
is an extremely unhealthy, pathological phenomenon. How all of 
us (the electorate, Russia, Vladimir Volfovich himself included) 
will extricate ourselves from this pathological business I 
cannot imagine. 
  Nonetheless, I shall cite several exculpatory facts in my 
defense. 
  I was never a member of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]. 
I 
was a member of Vladimir Volfovich's shadow cabinet for just 
several months. I left Zhirinovskiy without a scandal and 
formed, having united with dissidents of his LDP (they include a 
good half of the shadow cabinet: Kurbskiy, Arkhipov, Zharikov, 
and even A. Mitrofanov, who is now very close to Zhirinovskiy), 
the National Radical Party back on 22 November 1992. Why did I 
leave Zhirinovskiy? The LDP is Vladimir Volfovich alone, and the 
party members, his mute servants. Back at the time of the joint 
trip to Krasnodar Kray and while observing him daily during the 
trip to Paris I ascertained little by little that alongside 
undoubted political talent there happily reside in Zhirinovskiy 
total unscrupulousness and political recklessness. For example, 
while promising loudly at a mass meeting in a Cossack village 
clubhouse to rid the Cossacks of the Armenian mafia, he swore 
the following day in my presence to a representative of the 
Armenian mafia to defend Armenian interests in exchange for cash 
transactions beneficial to the party. After hundreds of such 
instances, I realized that Zhirinovskiy is an adventurer. But we 
were all involved in the common struggle against Yeltsin, and I 
did not, therefore, consider myself entitled to attack an ally 
at that time. 
<H5>  Simply Theater! </H5>
  An article by Lev Aleynik from Moscow appeared on 15 January 
1993 in the newspaper RUSSKAYA MYSL, which is published in 
Paris. It adduced information to the effect that Zhirinovskiy 
had several years ago been an activist in the Jewish movement. 
"Stored at the Shalom Theater," Aleynik concludes his article, 
"where the vaad is still billeted, are the archives of the 
Jewish movement, which had emerged from the underground. There 
is among the multitude of documents the first actual list of 
telephone numbers of the board (of the Jewish Culture 
Society--E.L.), which had just been elected. There figures on 
this list beneath the number 12 the present 'defender of the 
Russians' Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy." Aleynik's article 
dealt the final blow to my belief that Zhirinovskiy is a 
politician. A man who in several years had swapped three 
ideologies--and mutually inimical ones at that! (following his 
unsuccessful career as an active Zionist, he was for some time a 
"democrat" also)--is undoubtedly an adventurer, I said to 
myself. And I wrote last February the article "Perversions of 
Nationalism," part two being headed "Miscarriage of 
Nationalism." The article was devoted entirely to Zhirinovskiy 
and my relations with him. Publication of the article against 
the "lawyer" in the complex world of patriotic and democratic 
newspapers was a difficult business. Many editors refused to 
publish it. PRAVDA held up the article all summer. Only toward 
the end of summer was it finally carried in NOVYY VZGLYAD No. 
117. Unfortunately, NOVYY VZGLYAD is distributed mainly in 
Moscow, and the influence of "Perversions of Nationalism" was 
limited, therefore. Zhirinovskiy did not fail to respond to me, 
carefully skirting his Jewish activism, in NOVYY VZGLYAD also. 
<H5>  Point Five </H5>
  Today, when the West has itself been preoccupied with 
Zhirinovskiy's nationality, no one can censure me for racism, 
and it is possible to reflect without encumbrance on the history 
of Vladimir Volfovich--shameful for Russia and Russians. Whereas 
the nationality of Gaydar is a matter of indifference to me and 
it is all the same that he is an exponent of nonnational, 
mondialist ideas, the nationality of Vladimir Volfovich and his 
papa--Volf--is important. A Jew masquerading as a Russian 
nationalist--THIS is a sickness, pathology, THIS IS TOO MUCH. It 
is the sickness simultaneously of both Vladimir Volfovich and 
Russian society. Each time I see him, reddish-haired and 
vulgarly arguing with a small-town accent about "Russians," whom 
he will defend and fix up, I am repelled, so unnatural is the 
part he is playing (I would like to know how the leaders of the 
extreme-right parties of Western countries, whom he has only 
just embraced, feel. The Germans?). 
  But what has happened is by no means an accident but a 
tragi-comic normality. If the Ivanovs themselves cannot organize 
in a nationalist party, there will always be a adroit native of 
Minsk, Pinsk, or Alma-Ata [Almaty] who will conceive a desire to 
take advantage of their national passions. It is clear that 
Vladimir Volfovich is in a state of panic fear. For he knows 
that if the news media pick up on, if they conceive a desire to 
pick up on, the information unearthed in Israel and the Shalom 
Theater and if they assemble into a single pile the evidence of 
his Zionist activism comrades, Russians will understand that 
Vladimir Volfovich is a political operator and that he should 
not be on the political stage, and he will be swept away 
forever. In any event, the saber or the Cossack's pike is the 
lot of all false Dmitriys. But Vladimir Volfovich's impudence is 
stronger than his fear. 
  Meanwhile we will see the struggle of Vladimir Volfovich and 
Boris Nikolayevich (even if they become allies). Beware, 
Vladimir Volfovich, Boris Nikolayevich, he has bested Mikhail 
Sergeyich and Aleksandr Vladimirovich (Rutskoy) and even Ruslan 
Imranovich, also an eastern individual, like yourself. And Boris 
Nikolayevich has tanks.... 
<H5>  Fire-Breathing Dragon </H5>
  The backstage of politics is unknown to the voter. He is not 
a frequenter of it, he is not admitted there. A pity, because 
the future has already existed in the past and has only been 
hiding, undeveloped, here backstage, but it, the future, could 
have been seen here at the start of 1992 even. All today's 
contradictions have already existed. Even then the moderate-pink 
Zyuganov was driving out the bright-red heroic Anpilov from the 
meetings of the "respectable" opposition. Even then the shifty 
Vladimir Volfovich was receiving his first money from 
sympathetic businessmen--boy bankers in colored coats--and those 
whom the Yeltsinites had short-changed in the shareout of the 
plump pie--Russia. 
  In order to understand what the future has in store for us 
we 
need first of all to have a correct view of our present. Those 
who are happy with the result of the elections--"Gaydar and his 
Yeltsin team really got a faceful!"--are rejoicing in vain. And 
the nationalists have to see, despite the clear weakening of the 
president's "boys in pink pants," the next disturbing reality: 
The antinational forces have increased both in importance and in 
power and that this dragon now has three heads. Onto the lisping 
and guttural Gaydar-Yavlinskiy-Yeltsin demo-head have adhered 
fast on heavy necks two new ones. The boffola physiognomy of the 
Zhirinovskiy-Kashpirovskiy self-interested persons bares its 
teeth in all its vulgar obscenity: "Zhirinovskiy and Russia 
Corporation," the head likes to gorge! The pink, replete, 
"weak-communist" head elongated by the tie and gray suit of the 
deputy and ex-apparatchik of the CPSU, peaceably dissembles, 
yawning, the head of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation. But there flash in the yawn now and again sharp 
little teeth. The fact that the heads fight one another from 
time to time means absolutely nothing. These are the heads of a 
single beast. 
  The smashing of parliament was a major defeat for the 
nationalists and, consequently, Russia and Russians. We should 
not, pouting with hysterical fervor, be trying to prove the 
opposite. Yes, a defeat, a rout. Parliament contained an 
ill-assorted crowd of fellow travelers united only by a common 
opposition to Yeltsin and Company. There was no chief, there 
were leaders (and all leaders are, for the most part, 
accidental). There were no weapons. There were few--yes, 
few--people resolved to fight and capable of fighting. And only 
the national radicals were both capable and resolved. The 
nationalist youth. The authorities ascertained unerringly who 
posed a physical danger to them and, immediately following the 
smashing of parliament, banned some of the radical parties. 
Another part was captiously sifted through the malicious sieve 
of the Central Election Commission.... The result: 13 
nationalist parties and associations were not admitted to the 
electorate. Yet "our" Zhirinovskiy and the mild slate of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation headed by Zyuganov 
were admitted. 
  For a whole year--from the fall of 1992--Vladimir 
Volfovich's 
behavior was exemplary. He took part like a well-behaved 
schoolboy in the work of Yeltsin's Constitutional Commission. He 
did not take part in the events of 21 September-4 October. True 
to the instinct of the self-interested person, he attempted on 
each occasion to sell himself to both, it is true: He grieved 
over "the best officers who died at the White House" and in 
another speech justified the actions of the president. 
Zhirinovskiy had by the time of the elections arrived wholly as 
one of them, a useful ally of Yeltsin for the adoption of the 
constitution, and for this reason the Central Election 
Commission turned a blind, benevolent eye to the lists of 
signatures for nomination of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia]. 
<H5>  Janus Wolfovich </H5>
  Few people have noticed this, but Zhirinovskiy has always 
cultivated two images simultaneously. Because there are 
two Zhirinovskiys: for the rich and for the poor, if 
you like. The LDPR's official program (all versions, including 
Zhirinovskiy's draft Constitution of Russia and a concise 
exposition of the principles of the LDPR, are dated April 1993) 
is a respectable democratic program, which promises both 
privatization and the transfer of title to the land. The fact 
that "the LDPR is a party that rejects shock therapy" sways no 
one today because it, the shock, is rejected now by both 
Yavlinskiy and Chernomyrdin himself. The fact that the LDPR "is 
for the gradual reconstitution of the Russian state" is also a 
trite statement in 1994. It is, on the other hand, very 
interesting that clause 2 of the Constitution of Russia of the 
LDPR reads: "All power in Russia belongs to the people, which 
exercise it...." Which people, Vladimir Volfovich? There is no 
place in your constitution, as in Yeltsin's also, for the 
Russian people. But Russians constitute 85 percent of the 
population of Russia, it is they who created Russian 
civilization and the state. How can this be? This, for 
comparison, is how the Constitution of the French Republic 
begins: "The French people solemnly proclaim...." The point is 
that the LDPR program was written not for Untermenschen (let 
them sit quietly, they have, after all, been told that they will 
be defended by the brokers and second-hand dealers! "Russians 
and the small peoples on the territory of Russia and the USSR" 
will be defended by the "Zhirinovskiy and Russia Corporation") 
but was written for the boy bankers in colored coats. One such 
boy, in green, paid for the visit of Zhirinovskiy and his team 
to Paris in September 1992. On that visit, incidentally, 
Zhirinovskiy called me one morning and expressed a desire to 
meet with... Rothschild! "Which one?" I asked. "There are dozens 
of Rothschilds...." "The main one, the banker".... 
  The LDPR program does not encroach on the social reality 
engendered by Yeltsin and his "boys." Crowds of poor people and 
Mercedes and dying plants, where the workers have not received 
their wretched wages for several months, and commercial banks, 
which are being built like mushrooms after a bloody rain, will 
in the same way coexist. Only the national president will be a 
former Jewish activist, not a former secretary of the Central 
Committee. 
  For the Untermenschen, on the other hand, for the people, 
who 
are not in the constitution even, Zhirinovskiy employs another 
program--of stupefaction. Geopolitical daydreams evoked on 
television. Russians appear in them, but as... the soldier 
Vladimir Volfovich. These soldiers are washing their boots in 
the waters of southern seas, avenging Vladimir Volfovich, and 
declaring war on Germany. They are threatening Poland, China, 
Iran, Turkey.... They are threatening Japan with a repetition of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Vladimir Volfovich has for three 
years now been promising to slip the Balts radioactive waste. 
All these totally impracticable pieces of high-sounding nonsense 
(it would be difficult to cope even with Ukraine were matters 
really to reach the point of war) are evoking a response in 
Russian hearts (they did so both in June 1991 and in 
November-December 1993). Humiliated since 1985, the Russian 
electorate has with pleasure given itself over to nostalgic 
daydreams about lost power, about imperial might. Participating 
unwittingly in the performances of television nostalgia 
abundantly paid for by the boy bankers, the Russian electorate 
generously showed Zhirinovskiy and his corporation its 
gratitude. But all this is fraudulent, daydreams for the poor. 
Zhirinovskiy is no more the enemy of the West than Yeltsin. One 
Samuel Francis writes in THE WASHINGTON POST of 28 December 1993 
in the article "We Are Turning Zhirinovskiy Into an Arch-Enemy 
Wholly Without Cause": "It is possible that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is 
an enemy, and we should then be his enemies, but, his crude 
mouth aside, he has up to now done nothing against the United 
States or, generally speaking, against anyone else either." 
<H5>  Backing the Wrong Horse </H5>
  Whereas Zhirinovskiy is today a greater evil for Russia than 
Yeltsin, the third head of the beast is less dangerous. It is 
dangerous only in that it wants some power and will bite to 
death for it! I want to say to Zyuganov: "Gennadiy Andreyevich! 
Stop calling yourself a communist! Stop exploiting the communist 
voter! The basis of communist doctrine are two fundamental 
concepts: proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. You and your party of gray suits, on the other 
hand, have long since jettisoned in practice the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and proletarian revolution. Without them, 
though, you and your hierarchy of former and present 
nomenklatura types are, at best, compromisers and social 
democrats, at worst, impostors, not communists. And in the Duma 
you will logically be accomplices of either Yeltsin or 
Zhirinovskiy. Neither is honorable." In November, in the area of 
Krasnaya Presnya, I saw traced out on a fence in red letters: 
"Zyuganov, where is your brother Anpilov?" This says it all. The 
Red Brigades in Italy once went even further. They would 
knee-cap professionals of the "red bourgeoisie," crippling them 
for life. Considering them bigger enemies than the ruling 
Christian Democrats. Since the "red bourgeoisie" had betrayed 
the proletariat. 
  The unsophisticated Russian electorate has backed the wrong 
horse repeatedly. After the first clash with the "democratic" 
Special Militia on Tverskaya on 23 February 1992, the people's 
masses, beaten by democratic nightsticks, poured from the 
demonstration and cursed among themselves, admitting that they 
had voted in June 1992 [dates as published] for Yeltsin. "We 
brought it on ourselves." It had taken the people seven months 
to understand their mistake. Watching the small-town bazaar, the 
Sholom-Aleykhem play put on in the State Duma by the "defender 
of the Russians," possessed with megalomania and having lost his 
head at his success, and his team of "ites," how much time will 
you need, blind ones, to recover your sight? To understand that 
Vladimir Volfovich wants to meet Rothschild.

<F P=106> [Untitled report on poll conducted by the Moscow Branch </F>
of VTsIOM, by Oleg Savelyev, VTsIOM sociologist] 
  [Text] In the blitz poll of roughly 1,300 of the capital's 
inhabitants conducted in late February 1994 by the Moscow Branch 
of VTsIOM [All-Russian Central Institute of Opinion Polls] by 
order of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, an attempt was made to identify 
the number of potential supporters and probable members of 
political parties, both present and possible future members. 
  Responses to the question "NAME THE 5-6 POLITICAL FIGURES OF 
RUSSIA WHOM YOU TRUST THE MOST" were distributed in percentages 
in the following way (data of similar polls by VTsIOM conducted 
on 5 August, 27 October, and 15 December 1993 are cited for 
comparison)--Figure 1 [figure omitted]. 
  Responses to the question "IF POLITICAL LEADERS SUCH AS 
BABURIN, GAYDAR, ZHIRINOVSKIY, ZYUGANOV, POPOV, RUTSKOY, AND 
YAVLINSKIY HAD THEIR OWN POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH ONE WOULD YOU 
VOTE FOR IN THE FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS IF THEY WERE HELD NEXT 
SUNDAY?" are illustrated in the numerator in the table for those 
polled overall, while the denominator shows only the responses 
for those respondents who answered affirmatively to the question 
"AND WOULD YOU JOIN SUCH A PARTY/MOVEMENT?" (overall 27 percent 
said yes to this question, 60 percent said no, and 13 percent 
found it difficult to answer). Fifty-one percent of the 
respondents stated that they would not take part in the voting 
or had difficulty answering. Figure No 2. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-034-15A>      Figure 2. </FIG>

  The lower row in the same figure shows the number of party 
members they could, in principle, figure on, calculated by 
simply multiplying the answers received to both questions by the 
number of inhabitants of Moscow. 
  This fairly primitive estimate is very approximate and 
basically just reflects the political sympathies of Muscovites 
at the time of the poll. We therefore caution you in advance 
that neither MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS nor VTsIOM will accept 
claims for reimbursement of expenditures for party card blanks 
that are not used. 
  Obviously, the "parties" of Gaydar and Yeltsin must be 
joined 
for the final victory of democracy. Once again it is unlikely 
there is any hope for the proud Yavlinskiy.

militsia men, among the unemployed, and generally among men, 
persons 25-40 years of age, persons with incomplete higher 
education, and persons who voted for Zhirinovskiy's party and 
the communists; 
  E. Pamfilova--among pensioners, among specialists of the 
technical specialization, among entrepreneurs with their own 
businesses, among humanitarian specialists, and generally among 
women, persons under 25 or over 40 years of age, persons with 
less than secondary education, incomplete higher education, or

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "In the Corridors of </F>
Power": "It Is a Dark Night in the Russian Federation Procuracy"] 
  [Text] After the unexpected resignation of A. 
Kazannik, Aleksey Ilyushenko was appointed acting general 
procurator of the Russian Federation. His name is linked in the 
mind of many people with the so-called "Rutskoy case." Let us 
recall that the case went into high gear along with the 
intensification of the political crisis and involved charges of 
corruption against the former vice president. It was alleged 
that he had something to do with foreign currency accounts in 
Switzerland, as well as ownership of the Trade Links company. 
But is it legitimate to assume that A. Ilyushenko's appointment 
is associated only with the "Rutskoy case"? 
  This is what we have been able to find out in the 
general procuracy from various sources, since A. Ilyushenko 
himself refrains from comment. 
  On the eve of the elections and referendum on 12 December, 
the Moscow procuracy closed the corruption case against A. 
Rutskoy. Note that public comments on this event came from 
investigator M. Slinko instead of Moscow Procurator G. 
Ponomarev, who chose to remain silent. Then the "case" went for 
review by the General Procuracy-- the sphere of supervision of 
A. Kazannik (whose principled stance we all seemed to have seen 
proof of). After that, three top specialists independently come 
to the conclusion that "...the decision to close the criminal 
case regarding A. Rutskoy should be revoked... The General 
Procuracy should be tasked with further investigation of the 
criminal case by reason of the scale of the criminal case and a 
large number of questions requiring establishment of contacts on 
a federal level. I. Bobrovskiy, the general procurator's 
assistant for special tasks." 31 January 1994. 
  This document, as well as a number of others, prompted A. 
Kazannik to speak up at the General Procuracy collegium at the 
end of February. "Three of our best specialists, for the purpose 
of ensuring legitimacy, studied the materials independently of 
one another. All of them came to the conclusion that the Moscow 
City Procuracy did not answer a single question. In addition, 
the investigation had been conducted with gross violations of 
the norms of criminal law, in particular, Article 67 of the 
Russian Federation Criminal Process Code... Moscow investigators 
are threatening to charge persons who have handed over documents 
with slander. I am not sure, however, who should be charged 
under Article 130 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code." 
  The aforementioned Moscow procuracy investigators were not 
present at the collegium. Moscow Procurator G. Ponomarev, 
however, was present and sat in the presidium. He, however, 
remains silent to this day. The man who is still talking is the 
same M. Slinko, with respect to whom the principled A. Kazannik 
had his doubts. 
  All in all, after a number of meetings with procuracy staff 
one gets the impression that the procuracy, torn apart by 
politicians, is now completely demoralized. Despite the experts' 
conclusion and A. Kazannik's statement, six volumes of the 
"Rutskoy case" ended up in the General Procuracy, and another 10 
volumes--in the Moscow City Procuracy... There is every reason 
to believe, however, that the conclusions of A. Kazannik's 
commission will indeed prevail and "the case of A. Rutskoy's 
trust" will be brought to a logical conclusion. In any case, 
Canadian notary public Chapnik, who continues to maintain that 
he had notarized genuine documents with a genuine signature, is 
at this point well and alive. Besides, it is possible that after 
the conversation with Russian investigators, Chapnik himself 
will come under charges of perjury. Then he will face criminal 
prosecution in Canada.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Portanskiy, IZVESTIYA: "The Higher the </F>
Import Barriers, the Further Away the Country Is From a Market 
Economy"] 
  [Text] The liberalization of foreign trade is one of 
the main components of the economic reform being implemented in 
our country. An increase in customs tariffs on imports, which 
was confirmed a few days ago by the Russian Federation 
Government, runs counter to the principle of free trade. 
  A fight within the government over the change in import 
tariffs has been under way for about half a year. As early as at 
the end of last year, all the necessary documents were submitted 
to the government, but at that time it did not resolve to 
proceed with raising the duties. At that time, other members of 
the government--Boris Fedorov, Yegor Gaydar--came out vigorously 
against such a step, along with the leadership of the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations (whose position remains unchanged 
at present). As is known, the array of forces on the government 
team is different now. An energetic industrial lobby drawing on 
Oleg Soskovets and an agrarian lobby headed by Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha have ultimately "ramrodded through" the version of 
the document that they needed. 
  Naturally, the revision of import duties is not being 
carried 
out for the sake of some abstract principles or established 
international rules. The interests of consumers and the 
development of competitive production within the country are the 
principal points. So, first of all a tariff should not raise the 
cost of living for the people. IZVESTIYA wrote in detail 
yesterday about the fact that the government decree on new 
import duties that was issued on 10 March will bring about a 
considerable growth of prices for foodstuffs. Let us note in 
addition to what has been said that the effectiveness of this 
measure with regard to the protection of our domestic market for 
foodstuffs, which to the mind of the authorities it is aimed to 
accomplish, is far from certain, too. 
  Nowhere in the world are duties charged on the raw-material 
group of commodities. Meanwhile, the new tariff introduces, for 
example, a 25-percent duty on imported wool. However, it is 
known that our knitwear factories need wool of a particular 
quality--our wool, as a rule, is good only for military 
overcoats and felt boots. Therefore, in this case higher prices 
for imports will bring about yet another increase in prices for 
finished goods and a drop in their competitiveness on the 
foreign market. This will be happening at a time when 
restrictions on the delivery of our textiles and knitwear abroad 
exist to begin with; now we are ourselves hampering our own 
business. 
  An increase in import duties on integrated circuits to 60 
percent for certain types is another equally vivid example. It 
is clear that we will hardly reach the world level in electronic 
equipment in the immediate future; that is to say, we will set 
back our own consumers of chips. However, even the Japanese buy 
them. 
  Of course, a reasonable protectionist policy occasionally 
benefits the national economy, and many states do resort to it, 
but for the most part temporarily. The very changes in the 
import tariff are a complex issue. For example, a domestic 
producer of powdered milk demands that a duty be levied on a 
similar product manufactured abroad, while asking at the same 
time that no duties be introduced on foreign equipment for his 
plant. The Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of 
Railways are interested in the reduction of duties on railway 
cars, whereas the producers of the latter demand the opposite. 
It is virtually impossible to accommodate all at the same time. 
  Finally, higher customs barriers to imports are very hard to 
combine with our aspiration to occupy a proper place in world 
trade and, in particular, to join the GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) and to sign a partnership and cooperation 
agreement with the European Union. After all, the prevailing 
trend in world trade in the recent decades has consisted 
precisely of reducing the barriers to trade consistently.

<F P=106> [Interview with former General Procurator of the Russian </F>
Federation Aleksey Kazannik by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent 
Nikolay Kutorgin; in Omsk, date not given: "Why I Parted From 
the President"] 
  [Text] Twice over the past five years of the 
tumultuous Russian history has the name of an Omsk resident, 
jurist Aleksey Kazannik, been prominently connected with that of 
Boris Yeltsin. The first time was when he have up his seat in 
the USSR Supreme Soviet for the disgraced politician. 
  Now the "unauthorized" resignation of General Procurator 
Kazannik--immediately accepted by the president--is being 
discussed equally heatedly. The jurist, in turn out of favor, 
has returned to Omsk, where our correspondent met with him. 
  [Kutorgin] Aleksey Ivanovich, when you took the job you said 
that the procuracy's work will be subordinate to the law. 
However, the first serious disagreement with the authority, with 
the president, showed that the "law of authority" in our country 
is currently stronger than the authority of the law. Or is it 
now quite so? 
  [Kazannik] Almost so. I was very well aware that the 
president and his team are masters of creating dead-end 
situations and resolving them by unlawful means. Take, for 
instance, the October crisis, when the president placed the law 
on the Constitutional Court on the list of suspended acts. But 
it never occurred to me that they would so frankly, so crudely 
violate the still "warm" Constitution, and the State Duma Decree 
"On Political and Economic Amnesty." In a civilized country the 
entire team would have been sent packing for such a violation. 
  Still, I am convinced that this is not a defeat of the law 
and not a personal tragedy for General Procurator Kazannik. In 
the final analysis, this is the defeat of the entire 
presidential team. People who blindly believe in the primacy of 
force over legality are doomed. Society cannot exist without 
continuity, stability, predictability. Without strict compliance 
with the law we will not know what awaits us tomorrow, even by 
the end of the day. Daily uncertainty wears people out, makes 
their life unbearable. We cannot live like this any more. 
  [Kutorgin] Does this mean that you have reappraised your 
values? I am a witness that the act of giving up your seat in 
the Supreme Soviet in favor of Yeltsin was not an emotional 
reaction--rather, you carried out your electoral promise to Omsk 
residents, which you had given at a rally long before you were 
elected to the Supreme Soviet. You sincerely believed in Yeltsin 
then--a democrat and a statesman. Does this mean that you see 
him differently now? 
  [Kazannik] I will tell you honestly. Until recently I saw 
Yeltsin through the rose-colored glasses of 1985-1989. I was 
greatly impressed by his speech at one of the last party 
congresses, in which he talked about the lack of democracy, 
about abuse in the upper echelons of power. I especially liked 
his confession that in the past he had been afraid to tell the 
truth. I also liked Yeltsin's democratic style: He goes to the 
stores himself, rides the subway and trolley buses. I did not 
pay attention, though, to the fact that whenever he went to a 
store, by pure coincidence there were also journalists with 
television cameras there. Not least, there was also this 
traditional feeling of sympathizing with the underdog. And I 
sincerely hoped then that he would be able to bring together 
truly democratic forces in the USSR Supreme Soviet. 
  He did not bring anybody together. 
  [Kutorgin] Wait a minute, your protege was a leader in the 
Interregional Deputy Group [IDG]. 
  [Kazannik] You know, there are formal and informal leaders. 
Yeltsin was the leader by virtue of his job. The IDG's informal 
leader was Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov. I have no doubt that 
had Sakharov still been with us now, he would have voiced his 
contempt for the president and his team's petty intrigues around 
the amnesty, for instance. 
  [Kutorgin] So when was it, Aleksey Ivanovich, that you saw 
the light? 
  [Kazannik] Paraphrasing the well-known lines of a poet, I 
can 
say that you see big things better from a distance, but small 
ones in close-up. Looking from Omsk, I thought that Boris 
Nikolayevich was not a bad leader. It was painful for me to see 
his mistakes, which were literally there on the surface. But to 
get to know a person you have to eat a bushel of salt with him. 
In my time as the general procurator I was not that close to 
Yeltsin. Nevertheless, I became convinced that this man has no 
respect for the law. He can make a decision at any moment that 
would be contrary to the law and the Constitution, and instruct 
his team to find a way to get around the prescriptions of legal 
norms. And they would work hard to accomplish it... 
  Yeltsin never asked me in our conversations whether the 
procuracy strictly observed the law in investigations of 
criminal offenses. But he did ask often why such or such people 
were still free. After all, he would say, they have committed 
crimes, and something should be done about it. I calmly 
explained to the president that I would rather put a brand on my 
own forehead than put my signature to a blank piece of paper. 
That until we have convincing proof that these people have 
committed a crime, they cannot be detained or arrested. This is 
out of the question. And the president agreed with my arguments. 
But when it came to the notorious amnesty, I finally realized 
that our views on the law differ. Neither an individual nor 
society will benefit from arbitrariness and lawlessness, 
however. As soon as we learn to observe the law, in a month or 
two our life will become much easier... 
  [Kutorgin] So perhaps it was a different "reading" of the 
procuracy's duties on the part of you and the president that 
gave rise to rumors about the need to downsize it as a body not 
well suited to contribute to the envisaged reformation of our 
state? Or were these rumors groundless? 
  [Kazannik] The president had nothing to do with it. There 
was 
a large group of democrats at the Constitutional Assembly who 
were hostile to the procuracy. Now they work as the president's 
representatives in the State Duma, are generously represented in 
parliamentary factions Russia's Choice and PRES [Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord]. 
  Interestingly, I have not met opponents of a strong 
procuracy 
either among communists or liberal democrats. Only "real 
democrats" kept proposing to eliminate the procuracy or 
substantially cut its functions and subordinate it to the 
Ministry of Justice. The arguments in support of it were 
laughable. The procuracy, they said, does not fit into the 
system of separation of branches. Besides, it used to "serve" 
the totalitarian regime. I had the impression that these people 
were seriously trying to fit our traditional Russian reality 
into dogmatic theories of Western thinkers, and with the naivete 
of a six-year-old believed that other state bodies did not serve 
the totalitarian regime. 
  It appears that everything has been ruined in Russia by 
now--the economy, legality, culture, morality... Only the 
procuracy remained as a single centralized system. To a certain 
extent it acts as a guarantor of the unity and territorial 
integrity of Russia. In an environment where our country is 
overcome by a tidal wave of crime, we cannot tinker with the 
procuracy. It took a tremendous effort on my part to "squeeze" 
Article 129 into the draft Constitution literally days before 
its publication, and thus protect and legally formalize the 
system of procuracy organs. 
  It is regrettable that Western specialists understand the 
danger of reforming the procuracy, but our democrats do not. In 
May last year a pan-European conference on the problems of 
procuracy reform was held in Vienna. And specialists from all 
countries came to two fundamental conclusions. First, attempts 
to reform the procuracy without taking into account historical, 
national, and cultural specificities usually do not succeed. 
  Second, in the environment of instability, social crises, 
and 
cataclysms, it is extremely dangerous to reform the procuracy. 
We have ignored the conclusions of this extremely authoritative 
conference. Of course, I support an increased role of the 
courts. But what is the court now, with its high court costs? 
Not every person, especially a disfranchised one, can turn to it 
for protection of his interests. The procuracy has ended up 
being the only organization that provides free legal aid. 
  [Kutorgin] In Russia since time immemorial the procuracy 
also 
carried out general oversight. Especially now that the sarcastic 
conclusion of the classic is more true than ever: People do 
steal in Russia... 
  [Kazannik] Only a blind man would not see this. The 
democrats, however, have started telling us: You have no 
business at enterprises; if they have a problem, let them go to 
court. How do we resolve this new controversy: theft on an 
immense scale and new forms of managing production? Under my 
leadership the General Procuracy developed a concept of 
reforming general oversight: The procuracy must interfere 
immediately wherever the interests of entire regions, cities, or 
certain categories of the population are encroached upon. 
  For instance, we were checking on compliance with the 
legislation on preferences for Chernobyl victims. The situation 
is bad. And who except ourselves will check it out objectively? 
The sectoral inspectorate? Of course not. Or, for instance, the 
problem of implementing the legislation on support of orphaned 
children. We absolutely have to protect the interests of those 
without a voice, too. That is, the interests of disabled, 
underage, and elderly people. Those who for some reason do not 
even know where to turn to. 
  Third. There now exist 49 inspectorates--tax, customs, 
environmental protection, and others. They quite often violate 
the law. Who will keep them in line? And fourth. There are now 
many parties and various sociopolitical entities. By their 
unlawful activities they can bring society to an explosion in a 
matter of days. Who will conduct oversight in this area? The 
same goes for numerous private investigative and protection 
services. All of this falls into the sphere of general 
oversight. Instead, we are told: We need to fold the procuracy... 
  [Kutorgin] Perhaps it is the mafiosi structures that have 
the 
greatest stake in weakening the procuracy? And those people who 
have something to fear? 
  [Kazannik] I said the same thing many times publicly... 
  [Kutorgin] Could it be that the arguments over the 
procuracy's oversight rights also reflect the mushrooming 
administrative apparat's struggle for existence? 
  [Kazannik] Undoubtedly. The apparat has grown almost 10-fold 
as compared to the end of 1980's. And in my opinion, the growth 
of the apparat is in direct correlation to the bureaucrats' 
incompetency. This actually is obvious. When there is a highly 
skilled professional, he carries out a certain function or task 
alone. When there are no professionals, you need 10-15 clerks. A 
sad sign of our times... The government moved into the huge 
White House--there are no vacant offices there anymore. The 
president's staff moved to Staraya Square--no more available 
space there. In the Kremlin everything is filled to capacity. 
Even in our General Procuracy, which I wanted to reduce by half, 
there are twice as many staff as there were in the all-Union 
procuracy. 
  [Kutorgin] Where does such a influx of incompetency come 
from? 
  [Kazannik] I see two reasons for it. The first, and most 
important one. When the democrats came to power they did not 
have experience in administrative work. They did figure out, of 
course, that this way they would not stay in power. So they 
started to appoint people not by their business or professional 
qualities but by the principle of personal loyalty. It is not 
accidental that we kept reading in the newspapers at the time 
the assurances of contenders for cushy jobs: "I am loyal..." The 
second reason. A predominant amount of people in the highest 
echelons of power were party leaders. They, however, provided 
only general leadership. As they say, upheld the general line. 
As to routine work, they considered it beneath themselves to 
engage in it. This generally has led to the apparat's growth and 
its incompetency. 
  [Kutorgin] It looks as though the new constitution will not 
provide a barrier to this process either... 
  [Kazannik] We may criticize the new constitution, but 
currently it is a guarantee of stability of the state. This is 
the first constitution that clearly codifies the principle of 
separation of branches. But I see tremendous danger in the 
attempts that immediately ensued--to violate the constitution or 
get around it. One such attempt manifested itself in the 
attitude toward the issue of the amnesty. Another is in the idea 
to draft and sign a Memorandum of Civil Accord. Now many 
democrats sing praise for the president's initiative, admire his 
"propensity" for compromise and "desire" to establish peace and 
accord in society. 
  Excuse me, but what can you write in such a memorandum? 
Proclaim to the entire world that parties and sociopolitical 
movements will temporarily suspend their political activities 
and will not hold rallies and demonstrations? That miners and 
oil industry workers undertake to work without pay--just for 
moral satisfaction? And that all of us are to work hard strictly 
for the benefit of the coming generations? We have already lived 
like this for 70 years. 
  A reasonable question arises, though: How will the 
Memorandum 
and the Constitution correlate? The constitution has supreme 
legal force over any legal act. The constitution has given us 
extensive rights, including the right to engage in political 
activities. And if we put these restrictions into the 
Memorandum, it will again be lawlessness. I am amazed that such 
ideas, cataclysmic for society, occur to the bright minds in the 
president's team. For us, the constitution is the foundation of 
civil peace and accord. By the way, the president himself said 
that. But his words often diverge from his deeds. 
  [Kutorgin] And in whose, as you put it, bright minds, 
specifically, are such ideas born? 
  [Kazannik] Here is an example. The unsinkable democrat 
Poltoranin speaks at a press conference and says: We should not 
hold general elections in 1996; what we need is to extend the 
terms of the president and the Federal Assembly for two more 
years. We should not, he says, distract the people from creative 
labor with an election campaign. While they--that is, Mikhail 
Poltoranin and company--will direct. Let people work. It does 
not matter that the constitution says the direct opposite. The 
important point is that the democratic authorities are not bound 
by any laws; they are above the constitution! 
  Or, I read contrived "analytical" articles written by the 
patented democrat Gavriil Popov. Without a second thought he 
accuses me of some collusion with the president, faults me for 
not protesting, as Russia's general procurator, the Duma 
decision on political and economic amnesty while it was still at 
the stage of drafting and adoption. According to him, I was 
supposed to go to the Duma and convince the deputies to not 
adopt the "bad" decree on amnesty. 
  But it was the democrats at the Constitutional Assembly who 
stripped the general procurator of the right of legislative 
initiative, the right to issue at his discretion an evaluation 
of draft laws! 
  And more "practical" advice from Popov: Instead of carrying 
out the State Duma's amnesty decision, I should have simply... 
resigned. In his logic, the general procurator behaved not like 
a mature politician but as a professional jurist. Is this where 
the root of all evil is?! Wait a minute, Mr. Popov, no 
procurator likes the obsolete Criminal Code these days, among 
other reasons because it does not contain norms on combating 
corruption and organized crime. So what do we do now--do all 
procurators stop applying the norms of criminal law and resign 
en masse? It is not a procurator's business to discuss such 
things! He must ensure precise and undeviating compliance with 
the law. Regardless of what kind of law it is. 
  Perhaps the minds of many democrats are organized in a way I 
cannot comprehend. Their thoughts regarding compliance with the 
law go in an entirely different direction. It was recommended to 
me, for instance, not to release the Lefortovo prisoners without 
first obtaining a pledge from them that they would not engage in 
political activities. But all of this would be contrary to the 
constitution! The most adamant democrats maintain, however, 
quite seriously that observing the constitution and the law is 
not the main task of the general procurator. You see, he must be 
a politician and personally loyal to the president. 
  [Kutorgin] Is this not where the proposal came from to 
transfer Lefortovo prison to the procuracy's jurisdiction? 
  [Kazannik] For us, it was a complete surprise. Although, you 
know, I have also begun to get used to the fact that you cannot 
find the authors of presidential edicts and directives no matter 
how hard you look. The liquidation of the Ministry of Security 
was a surprise even for our glorious chekists. Thousands of 
criminal cases that were being investigated by security organ 
investigators were left hanging. In many of them, people had 
been arrested. They started moving "cases"--in sacks!--to the 
general procuracy without any legal grounds. We, however, do not 
have the staff, office space, or money to investigate "outside" 
criminal cases. We got our heads together. Prepared a draft 
presidential directive to transfer the investigative detention 
facility in Lefortovo to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], 
and the investigative staff, money, etc. to the procuracy. The 
heads of all the agencies involved initialed the draft--myself, 
Golushko, and Yerin. Then the directive comes out, from which I 
learn that the general procuracy for the first time in its 
history has acquired its own prison. That is something to see! 
  [Kutorgin] The paradox of the case with your resignation, 
Aleksey Ivanovich, is apparently clear to everybody. The press, 
however, especially the Moscow press, tirelessly continue to 
label you as a Don Quixote, a fighter of windmills. Why do you 
think this is happening? 
  [Kazannik] I think that it is simply beyond comprehension 
for 
journalists that a normal person can give up a high-level state 
job and a good salary. For this kind of goodies, some probably 
reason, one could keep in prison nearly the entire population of 
the country! After all, in the 1930's-1950's some criminal cases 
were fabricated for the single purpose of confiscating good 
apartments from honest people and giving them to chekists who 
did well in uncovering "enemies of the people." And here a man 
voluntarily, for the sake of some amnesty, gives up material 
things. Is it not obvious that he is God's fool? 
  [Kutorgin] Forgive me for asking, Aleksey Ivanovich, but 
could you reveal the burning secret: How much was the general 
procurator paid? 
  [Kazannik] The working people's acute curiosity regarding 
this issue is understandable. After all, we are still ruled by 
the Bolshevik perception that only wealth is worse than poverty. 
Well, after the new year my salary with all allowances amounted 
to almost 1 million rubles. A month. I was given an apartment in 
the so-called "presidential house." The general procuracy, in 
keeping with the law, provided me with financial aid (fully 
repayable), to help me settle in Moscow. But now it is all... 
history. I returned the apartment to the government of Moscow, 
and the furniture and other property--to the general procuracy 
apparat, in accordance with the inventory. Everything, to the 
last nail. 
  The second reason for all the scoffing around my persona is 
completely paradoxical: I wanted... to increase the fight 
against crime, to protect the individual's inalienable right to 
life. To this end, I intended to reform the procuracy. But this 
is not a realistic undertaking, they said; this is fighting 
windmills. We, meanwhile, drafted a concept of procuracy reform. 
We put at the forefront (on a pedestal, if you wish) the central 
figure in the criminal process--the investigator. He should be 
paid well, and be positioned high in the rank structure. A 
talented investigator, even in a rayon procuracy, should be 
awarded the title "distinguished," "honorary," "people's 
academician." Like rural school director Sukhomlinskiy! 
  In this undertaking I was met with understanding by the 
general procuracy's collegium, support in the regions, and 
frankly, I was joyous. Some journalists, however, began to 
contend that I had been deceived... everywhere. That is, that I 
was allegedly surrounded only by crooks. 
  [Kutorgin] Is it true that the presidential representatives 
in some regions attempted to "pressure" you and your staff, 
"influence" you, so to say, in their interests? 
  [Kazannik] Yes. After the October events the entire scope of 
authority in the regions essentially shifted to heads of 
administration and presidential representatives. Much like a 
long time ago, when petitioners went to Lenin, they began 
showing up at the general procuracy with one and the same 
request--to immediately remove the local procurator and replace 
him with one of "their people!" The main reason? Procurators' 
"hesitation" during the October crisis. In other words, they 
were making demands on the procurators in the spirit of old 
party traditions: You did not support the president's course, 
they said, did not show political maturity. "Vacillated together 
with the course..." We immediately turned away such petitioners. 
  I have not relieved of duty a single procurator for 
political 
reasons. Not a single one! The important point is not in waving 
the presidential banner, which has long turned into a worn rag, 
but, I repeat, strictly observing the law. 
  [Kutorgin] Those who have visited you at home before, 
Aleksey 
Ivanovich, will confirm, as I can, that the pilgrimage to power 
has not given you any material wealth. You still live in a 
Khrushchev period small apartment. With a view of an oil 
refinery and a penal colony. Next door is a dormitory for early 
parolees. Honestly--do you not regret that you ended up where 
you started? 
  [Kazannik] Honestly--a professor and a doctor of science 
probably could count on better housing. But I do not regret the 
loss of Moscow conveniences. Money is dear, but honor is dearer. 
  My own fate is not that important. I will return to the 
university, to my old collective, to my students. I will nurture 
new jurists into independent procurators who respect the law. 
They are the future... Will get involved in political activities 
as a volunteer. Perhaps I will give a hand to some people in the 
parliamentary and presidential elections in 1996. I realize that 
I have used up the limit of errors. If I am going to "fall" for 
someone, this time there should be no mistakes. It should be 
once and for all...

Andrey Uglanov; place and date not given; under the rubric 
"Special Opinion": "A. Nevzorov, the Deputy"] 
  [Text] It has been said so many times--that combating 
crime is the No. 1 task. M. Gorbachev, B. Yeltsin, R. 
Khasbulatov, A. Rutskoy, and V. Chernomyrdin all said it. A. 
Nevzorov, "600 Seconds" anchor, has also devoted a considerable 
part of his life to combating crime--through television. Today 
he is a Duma deputy from St. Petersburg and member of its 
Committee on Security. 
  [Nevzorov] The recipe for combating crime is extremely 
concise and sounds, shall we say, unacceptable to your 
democratic ears. It is called "Comrade Stalin." It is the only 
possible, 100 percent option for defeating crime. 
  [Uglanov] Can you be more specific? Zhirinovskiy, for 
instance, believes it necessary to introduce courts martial. 
  [Nevzorov] This is good when you have qualified 
executioners. 
They, unfortunately, also are in great shortage, because the 
executioners of the hated 1934 were guided by high ideological 
motives. Which are absent now. That society was healthy in 
comparison with ours. It was ugly, lopsided, but healthy. Now 
that all this social pus is oozing from every hole... 
  [Uglanov] This is a general condition. I am interested in 
concrete steps. Would perhaps tightening the Criminal Code help? 
  [Nevzorov] In the Committee on Security I oversee foreign 
intelligence. My task is to let it work unimpeded. As to 
Criminal Code articles and tightening them, it is not all 
straight and clear. S. Stepashin, for instance, came up with a 
proposal to make mercenarism a crime. But I will do everything I 
can to keep this article from getting into the Criminal Code in 
its current form. Can you, for instance, to draw a clear line 
between the notions of "mercenary" and "volunteer"? 
  [Uglanov] It is probably a question of money, is it not? 
  [Nevzorov] No. You arrive at the designated place. You are 
given a pea-jacket. It now costs 100,000. You eat a bowl of 
porridge. How much does this cost? If you add it all up, it 
comes to no less that the cost of having a Russian boy fighting 
in Karabakh. Therefore, even such attempts to tighten the 
Criminal Code are very imperfect. 
  As to the recipe for combating crime, it does not and cannot 
exist. We are a criminal state. A state that entered a new level 
with the shelling of the parliament on 4 October. 
  [Uglanov] In the past you were a television program anchor; 
now you are a lawmaker. Now your task is to prevent violations 
of the law rather than register them. 
  [Nevzorov] I am at a loss here because, first, I cannot 
answer for the entire Committee on Security. Second, I 
deliberately agreed to be thrown into this 
line--intelligence--rather than combating crime. Because I am 
convinced that in this fight we are doomed to fail. Sooner or 
later we will still have to capitulate to them. And live through 
a situation where legitimized criminals will take power anyway. 
We cannot stop now. Do you see a way to stop, to win? I do not. 
  [Uglanov] Regarding foreign intelligence. It has been headed 
for some time now by Ye. Primakov. Is it your goal to replace 
this man? 
  [Nevzorov] No. Frankly, this is an area of activity, an area 
of applying one's abilities in which politics should have no 
place. Sympathies and antipathies are inappropriate here. 
Because the agency lives. It may be one-hundredth of the old 
strength, but it is still the successor to greatest intelligence 
service in the world. Primakov is far from the saboteur my 
"friends" in the opposition camp want to see him as. He is a 
very complex man. As I understand it, he is not an enemy of this 
country. 
  [Uglanov] Regarding the Ames case. Could the disclosure of 
this Russian agent in the United States be the result of one of 
Ye. Primakov's deputies reporting it to the other side? 
  [Nevzorov] Do you really think I will tell you anything? On 
top of everything else, I have signed an official nondisclosure 
pledge. 
  [Uglanov] Where is your journalistic destiny heading now? 
  [Nevzorov] I am lucky. I have an opportunity to "shed my 
skin." This is rare for a journalist. I have the opportunity now 
to look into things in depth and seriously, to build some new 
bridges. 
  [Uglanov] What will happen to "600 Seconds"? 
  [Nevzorov] I do not think that the program could be 
resurrected now in its old form. For the reason that I spend 
most of my time in Moscow now. 
  [Uglanov] But do you have such plans? 
  [Nevzorov] I think so. We have to sort out the story 
regarding bribes on Petersburg television. Unfortunately, I will 
not be doing it myself. And anyway, it would be strange for me, 
a State Duma deputy, to devote my time to petty bureaucrat B. 
Kurkova. To find out whether she stole anything or not. I think 
the proper organs will sort this out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Deputy Minister of Communications </F>
B.P. Butenko by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent; 
place and date not given: "Poor Subscriber...: In 1993 Postal 
Service Losses From Distribution of Periodicals Amounted to More 
than 62 Billion Rubles"] 
  [Text] Increasingly items are appearing in the press 
that the postal service, by increasing its rates on distribution 
of periodicals, is making prices for newspapers and magazines 
unaffordable. Since this problem also concerns the multimillion 
audience of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY readers, we asked Russian Deputy 
Minister of Communications B.P. Butenko to clarify this 
situation. 
  [Question] Boris Petrovich, we heard that the Judiciary 
Chamber for Information Disputes has made a ruling regarding 
postal service rates. Please comment on it. 
  [Butenko] Unfortunately this document, prompted by articles 
in the newspapers IZVESTIYA, TRUD, and others, was not even 
coordinated with the Federal Postal Administration of Russia and 
was written in an extremely improper manner. The chamber 
discussed our rates, which in principle, according to the 
existing statute, it is not supposed to do. The entire document 
is built on emotions instead of the language of figures. We are 
accused of being a monopoly with respect to conduct of the 
subscription campaign. We say--take the subscription part. But 
nobody wants it--it is too hard. This is how we became an 
unwilling monopoly. 
  [Question] Is there no alternative to the postal service? 
  [Butenko] Foreign experience shows that delivery of printed 
material is the publishers' business. Over there the postal 
service works only on a contract basis and delivers only about 
30 percent of subscriptions. In our country all newspapers and 
magazines traditionally are distributed mainly through the 
postal service. Although by the current law on the mass media 
the publishers are supposed to distribute their product 
themselves on a contract basis, that is, the postal service may 
be just one of the systems engaged in distribution. Therefore 
we, the communications industry, offer our skills and experience 
for setting up alternative structures. 
  [Question] Still, why is it that nobody wants to seriously 
deal with this? Unprofitable? 
  [Butenko] More than that--it is pure loss! Last year our 
losses from distribution of newspapers and magazines amounted to 
62 billion rubles. Here is your answer. We are accused of 
rigging the figures, of postal subscription rates being 
unjustifiably high. But we are willing to provide objective 
information to any publisher at any time; we are willing to 
undergo any audit with respect to correctness of rate-setting. 
Another important point is that in setting local rates we 
recommend that these rates be coordinated with local committees 
on prices. We cover our losses with profits from other services 
and the state subsidy the postal service receives as a whole. 
  [Question] This does not make things easier for the 
subscriber. After all, he is paying out of his own pocket, and 
increasing amounts every year. 
  [Butenko] Readers should clearly understand that there are 
only two options. Either they have to pay what a newspaper or a 
magazine costs, including the entire publication process and 
delivery, or state subsidies are needed; this decision should be 
made at the government level. Subsidies should be targeted, and 
the population widely informed of this. 
  [Question] By the way, why is it that postal service prices 
differ in different oblasts of Russia sometimes by a factor of 
five to six? 
  [Butenko] There is nothing strange about that. Conditions 
are 
different everywhere; different delivery route distances, 
different gasoline prices, and so on. Besides, in some oblasts, 
where local authorities provide subsidies to the postal service, 
subscribers pay less. 
  There is one more nuance: Readers pay in advance, but no one 
can tell with certainty what inflation will be over this period, 
while both the publishers and the postal service must make good 
on their obligations to subscribers. Instead of finding a way 
out of this situation, many publishers started looking for a 
scapegoat, and found us--the postal service. But this handling 
of the problem will only result in bitterness between potential 
partners and will not help the cause. Moreover, it may bring 
antagonism between postal service staff and publishers even at 
the local level. 
  [Question] But, Boris Petrovich, you will not deny that 
local 
postal service systems do not have clear guidance in setting 
rates, and in some places they are pushing prices sky-high. 
Which immediately affects the number of subscribers. 
  [Butenko] I think that the Federal Postal Administration 
will 
sort things out with these oblasts and will provide 
recommendations to local branches. Our task is to keep rates at 
a level people can afford. But the postal service is a state 
structure, and the subsidies it gets mostly go into those 
services the population uses frequently: delivery of letters, 
small packages, parcels. I want everyone to understand--there is 
nothing there to make us rich, but the postal service, as 
before, will try to deliver to the readers the latest news in 
newspapers and magazines in a timely manner. 
  FROM THE EDITORS. There is no question that our 
communications industry is experiencing a lot of problems. 
Neither can its personnel boast of high salaries. We agree with 
B. Butenko that without government help, there is no solution. 
At the same time, however, we think that the postal service, 
too, can still do a great deal. ARGUMENTY I FAKTY is willing to 
work closely with the communications industry. The main goal is 
for subscribers to get their newspapers on time and at a 
reasonable price.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasiliy Kiselev, first deputy head of the </F>
Novosibirsk Oblast administration, by V. Maltseva, under the 
rubric "Express-Interview"; place and date not given: "Vasiliy 
Kiselev: `Oblast Administration's Responsibility Must Be 
Financed'"] 
  [Text] At a press conference Vasiliy Kiselev, first deputy 
head of the Novosibirsk Oblast administration, mentioned that 
beginning 1 April the territories will gain relative freedom in 
disposing of money received from the federal budget. The editors 
asked V. Kiselev to demonstrate with a socially significant 
example some opportunities for maneuver under the new conditions: 
  "Since responsibility for creating food reserves now rests 
entirely with the local bodies of authority, this responsibility 
must be financed. The edict on liberalization of the grain 
market prescribes that we form grain reserves with our own 
resources as well. The oblast needs 590,000 tonnes of 
grain--according to the most meager measure. The normal level, 
which takes into account the needs of specialized animal 
husbandry farms, is 850,000 tonnes. Even if we project that a 
tonne of grain will cost 100,000 rubles [R] (and realistically 
this figure should be doubled), we need R100 billion to pay for 
this 'purchase.' 
  "To protect grain suppliers from inflationary costs and 
guarantee these deliveries into the reserve fund, we have to pay 
an advance of at least 25-30 percent of the cost of grain 
procurement. 
  "After taking credits year after year and then paying them 
back, we came to the conclusion that a different system was 
needed--we need to put this process on a compensated-delivery 
basis. In this connection we are looking into the question of 
setting up a grain customer service--the oblast administration's 
committee on the economy will be that customer. This will change 
the relations with the existing Russian Grain Products agency's 
system on our territory. 
  "Why are we bringing up the question of changing the terms 
of 
cooperation? 
  "Last year, for instance, the oblast took out a loan from 
the 
budget and gave it to the Novosibirsk Grain Products agency. For 
the most part, of course, the money was used as intended, but at 
the same time some money was "skimmed off" for other 
payments--for instance, this organization's debts for prior 
deliveries. 
  "Why is this paid for with our money? Most likely because it 
is state money, our common money, and one does not count it. But 
in reality it is already different money. 
  "Therefore we need a mechanism that would guarantee that if 
we spent R40 billion on grain procurement, this grain would be 
ours. Other partners simply provide for us services in getting 
the grain into proper condition and processing it, but at the 
same time the oblast does not lose the right of ownership of the 
grain. And, correspondingly, proceeds from sales will also 
belong completely to the oblast. We can start giving the money 
generated to producers, to finance the 1995 harvest. 
  "This new ideology of market relations will allow us to save 
money, and this money we now be `circulating' only within the 
boundaries of the oblast financial system."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Malkov, director of the Sibrokko </F>
insurance company, by N. Antipina; place and date not given; 
under the rubric "Express-Interview": "Creeping `Intervention?'"] 
  [Text] There have been reports in the mass media that 
foreign insurance companies are quietly penetrating the Russian 
market, which causes concern among domestic insurers. Are these 
reports true, and what does this sort of "intervention" hold for 
Russia? I brought these questions to Aleksandr Ivanovich Malkov, 
director of the Sibrokko insurance company. 
  [Malkov] I have personally talked to representatives of 
foreign insurance companies which came to Novosibirsk to conduct 
a seminar. In particular, with representatives of the Austrian 
company Grave. Under the guise of seminars they look for clients 
who may easily fall for dollar-wrapped promises. Having 
purchased an insurance policy in a foreign company, the client 
acquires the right to distribute the insurance policy, bringing 
in new clients... Foreign companies, working illegally in our 
market, are counting on the president signing a decree 
permitting them to do this. 
  [Antipina] What consequences may the penetration of 
insurance 
market by foreign companies have for Russia? 
  [Malkov] You see, in the West, out of 100 large enterprises, 
the controlling share of 25-27 is owned by insurance companies, 
because insurance capital is measured by an annual inflow of 
money of approximately $1.1 trillion. This capital must be put 
to work, of course. So it works, including as enterprise stock. 
And, as is known, he who pays the orders... what this enterprise 
is to produce. 
  In our country the dollar is worth more than 1,500 rubles 
[R]. An insurance company may sell $1,000 in Novosibirsk, for 
instance, and immediately have more than R1.5 million, which it 
can then use to purchase a controlling share, for instance, in 
one of the major banks. Who will manage this bank? This is 
penetration of the national financial economy. The same may be 
said about penetration of the industrial economy, because 
enterprises are now being privatized... 
  [Antipina] Can this process be blocked somehow? 
  [Malkov] We have to watch it; make public every fact of 
foreign companies' foray into the Russian insurance market; send 
information on it to the insurance oversight agency of the 
country where this company came from. 
  [Antipina] What about our Russian Federal Service for 
Oversight of Insurance Activities? 
  [Malkov] Unfortunately, right now it is legally impotent. 
Despite the fact that way back in 1786 the tsarist government 
issued an edict forbidding other states from operating 
unceremoniously in our own fatherland. 
  [Antipina] While we are at it, tell us what is special about 
your company. 
  [Malkov] We work exclusively with legal entities. With large 
risk factors. We have this ability because our specialists are 
highly trained professionally--they have been trained in Italian 
insurance companies and also by the Russian Federal Service for 
Oversight of Insurance Activities. 
  We are engaged in a line of work nobody else in Novosibirsk 
has touched so far. We are so-called average commissioners. We 
sort out situations that occur, for instance, in cargo 
transportation: emergencies, theft, robbery... For this work we 
have specialists who utilize the full range of Western insurance 
companies' techniques.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.N. Lyulko, chairman of the Novosibirsk </F>
Fatherland movement, by A. Zharinov; place and date not given: 
"To Carry the Highest Truth"] 
  [Text] Allow me to introduce Aleksandr Nikolayevich 
Lyulko, a leader of the opposition and chairman of the 
Novosibirsk Fatherland movement. He graduated from School No. 73 
in Leninskiy Rayon and Novosibirsk University and is a candidate 
of physico-mathematical sciences. He is at the present time 
lecturing in mathematics at Novosibirsk State University. He is 
raising two children. 
  "My great grandfather Lyulko was exiled to Siberia from 
Ukraine back in the times of the tsars," Aleksandr Nikolayevich 
said. "He was a Zaporozhye Cossack by birth. My folk on my 
mother's side moved to Siberia, in accordance with Stolypin's 
reform, from Ryazan Province and founded the village of 
Semenovka, which is in Kochenevskiy Rayon. There were among my 
kinsfolk both insurgents and red partisans, and one of my 
relatives commanded a mounted reconnaissance party under 
Rokossovskiy." 
  [Zharinov] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, why "Fatherland"? We have 
become accustomed to using this word either in a poetical 
context or at moments of serious ordeals which have befallen our 
country.... 
  [Lyulko] We really believe that serious ordeals have 
befallen 
our country and the Russian people. I would say even that we are 
in fact living in an occupied country, where we ourselves are 
not deciding our fate. I recently read in NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA the article "There Is All of Russia in This Pawnshop," 
which adduces information to the effect that the countries of 
the Seven are demanding of us payment of an enormous amount of 
debt. And inasmuch as we are not in a position to make this 
payment at this time, the question of the loss of Russia's 
sovereignty is posed, that is, all decisions will be made for us 
overseas. We can see that this is already happening. And we 
members of Fatherland advocate the revival of a strong, 
independent Russian state, the Russian power. Whence the name 
fatherland. 
  [Zharinov] As far as I know, there are a number of other 
organizations that set approximately the same tasks. How does 
Fatherland differ from them? 
  [Lyulko] We are not democrats and we are not communists. We 
are a Russian Orthodox patriotic movement. We are a third force. 
Our main principle is this: "Constitutional development should 
be based on moral Orthodox values." And the revival of the great 
Russian state is possible only on an Orthodox ideological basis." 
  [Zharinov] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, are you not exaggerating 
this subjective factor, this substance called the Russian 
Orthodox spirit, saying that "only this will help us, and this 
is the sole thing that can now revive Russia"? There are, after 
all, more tangible things, without which we can hardly resolve 
anything, strictly speaking. 
  [Lyulko] Each state is built, develops, and is based on some 
idea, on traditions. Insofar as the leaders have no moral 
principles, they have turned constitutional development into 
their own feeding-trough. Public office is for them a means of 
lining their pockets. And it is no accident, therefore, that, 
according to information published in a German magazine and 
reprinted in SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, we now have 586 billionaires 
and that this list includes M.S. Gorbachev, who is building a 
summer home in Florida, and the present prime minister V.S. 
Chernomyrdin. A person participating in constitutional 
development must be first and foremost ethical. 
  But we do not deny the material aspect. Because unless we 
work and produce, we will simply die out. It is written in the 
Bible: You will earn bread by the sweat of your brow. But it is 
written there also that "man does not live by bread alone...." 
That is, we should not confine ourselves merely to material 
values. This way we become animals, for whom it is important 
merely to eat palatable food and sleep soundly and, in addition, 
display concern for perpetuation of the race. 
  [Zharinov] So all who are in power, in your opinion, are 
immoral and, if not mafiosi, then, at least, seducers, 
bribe-takers, and so forth? 
  [Lyulko] I do not believe so, but moral principles in the 
ruling clique are manifestly lacking. Otherwise how are we to 
explain the shooting up of the Supreme Soviet, the constitution, 
the planned unemployment, when millions of people have been left 
without means of subsistence, and the inflation which has led to 
the devaluation of cash deposits, primarily of retirees? 
Finally, permit me to ask who has in a matter of years plundered 
the country piece by piece or with whose consent has this been 
done? We now have St. Govorukhin's book "Great Criminal 
Revolution," in which he proves.... 
  [Zharinov] He proves nothing, he has adduced a number of 
facts, which confirm that, yes, the orgy of corruption and the 
mafia in Russia has assumed... I do not know what proportions. 
  [Lyulko] He adduced facts which indicate that the mafia and 
the authorities in Russia have coalesced. And it was no accident 
that protection boys--St. Govorukhin's book describes 
this--supported the authorities and stormed the White House in 
October 1993. It is no accident that at a government house in 
Yekaterinburg, where the president's grandsons live, a memorial 
plate in honor of the deceased head of the mafia, who lived in 
this very house, has been put up. 
  [Zharinov] How do you conceive of the new Russia? What does 
this represent as you understand it? 
  [Lyulko] First, as I have already said: The state should be 
developed on moral values. Otherwise we will continue to live 
according to the logic of whoever brings more tanks to the White 
House writes the laws. There must be a higher, divine truth. 
Further, we believe that Russia needs to be restored within the 
borders of the USSR, at least. Peacefully. And there are masses 
of ways of doing this. 
  [Zharinov] Economic sanctions, for example? 
  [Lyulko] Yes. More than half the world's natural resources 
are concentrated here. Gas, oil.... We could pursue a price 
policy such that the former republics would very quickly, 
believe me, align themselves with Russia. Remember history, how 
the proud Georgian tsars implored on their knees that Georgia be 
made a part of the Russian Empire. 
  [Zharinov] Understandably.... 
  [Lyulko] Believe me, if we raise the living standard of our 
people, and we can, all the other republics will come to us, 
their own people would demand this. 
  [Zharinov] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, an election campaign is 
under way. What are Fatherland's basic slogans? What do you 
offer? 
  [Lyulko] We see and undertake to resolve the problems of 
unemployment, an improvement in food supply, the construction of 
housing, and the fight against crime. 
  It is no secret that "military" constitutes 80 percent of 
the 
oblast's entire industry. It has now declined sharply. The 
plants are standing idle. I visited the Tochmash Plant, the 
Novosibirsk Electric Locomotive Plant.... I know that the plants 
have practically ceased to exist. In a shop at the Tochmash, 
where 1,200 persons used to work, there are now 10. And even 
they have not received their pay for August. Yet just recently 
our plants were manufacturing weapons that were being sold 
abroad, to Iraq particularly. S. Husayn declared officially that 
were the arms trade to continue, he would pay his debt to Russia 
of $10 billion. 
  At our invitation a visit was paid to Novosibirsk a year ago 
by a group of deputies of the Supreme Soviet, who, speaking at a 
session of the oblast soviet, declared that they had had an 
official offer from Arab countries for an interest-free loan to 
Russia of $40-50 billion, provided that we pursued a policy 
independent of America and Israel. 
  [Zharinov] You are for the arms market, consequently? 
  [Lyulko] Yes, we support the sale of weapons if this is in 
our national interests. 
  [Zharinov] And how is this tied in with Orthodoxy and the 
precepts of Christianity? 
  [Lyulko] We frequently understand by Orthodoxy Tolstoyism, 
which has nothing in common with the Orthodox idea. It is 
sufficient to recall that the Battle of Kulikovo was begun by 
two monks, who were blessed for this by the Orthodox saint 
Sergey Radonezhskiy. It should not be forgotten that Suvorov and 
Kutuzov were Orthodox people of profound faith. And Suvorov 
would reverently seek the blessing of any rural priest, and if 
you read his "Science of Victory" in full, two-thirds of it is 
about Orthodoxy. The sign of the cross--and forward, for the 
motherland! 
  [Zharinov] This is not an entirely successful example. 
  [Lyulko] For the fatherland.... 
  [Zharinov] It was not for the fatherland. The enemy had come 
with fire and sword.... And now?... 
  [Lyulko] Now the motherland is being destroyed. It should be 
clearly understood that without arms manufacturing Novosibirsk, 
as a city that was created in the war years as a military forge, 
will cease to exist.... 
  [Zharinov] I fear that we have strayed from the subject. 
Remind me of Fatherland's other tasks. 
  [Lyulko] Resolution of the food problem. Here is just one 
suggestion. G.P. Izotov, a zoological engineer, is a member of 
Fatherland. He developed the USSR's first plant for commercial 
fish production. Five to 10 plants can operate on the basis of 
one heat and electric power plant. The productivity of one is 80 
tonnes of fish a year. Consequently, on the basis of one heat 
and electric power plant it is possible to cultivate 400-800 
tonnes of fish a year. Some 800-1,600 tonnes of valuable food 
could be obtained on the basis of Heat and Electric Power 
Plant-2 and Heat and Electric Power Plant-3 in Leninskiy Rayon, 
say. This would be an appreciable addition to the table of our 
inhabitants. Such a plant has been operating successfully in 
Tashkent, incidentally. 
  Or another example. It is no secret that there are currently 
between the commodity producer and the customer many middlemen, 
who are jacking up by a factor of two or three the prices of 
basic foods. We need to get by without them. This would be done 
this way. A group of activists, retirees, in the main, would be 
formed, and we would negotiate directly with the kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes on the purchase of food: butter, meat, and so forth. 
We have close contacts with the Agrarian Party. Agreement could 
be reached with transport also. Then these activists would draw 
up orders among their neighbors--inhabitants of the 
neighborhood--and drive to the village. The food would be 
purchased, brought back, and sold at prices lower by a factor of 
1.5-2 than in the stores. 
  [Zharinov] Very well, let us assume that the tight food 
situation is alleviated. What about housing? 
  [Lyulko] There are several construction worker candidates 
for 
deputy in Fatherland--N.K. Tsyupka, I.V. Kolodenko, and V.P. 
Radustov, whom you all know as the creators of the circus, the 
new Young Spectator Theater, and other facilities. They have a 
program for resolving the housing problem. They have experience 
of how, relying on their own resources, to increase the 
construction of apartments. Construction workers of the 
Mostootryad appealed to me, as a deputy. Their capacity was 
standing idle, and they were not being allocated space for the 
construction of housing in the city. I managed to get land 
allocated. 
  [Zharinov] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, what you have said was 
done in the past. Now the range of issues being tackled by the 
soviet has been narrowed down to the limit. Are you not 
harboring illusions on this score? 
  [Lyulko] I do not believe so. The main issue--formation of 
the oblast budget--remains with the soviet. First, the soviets 
now, according to the constitution, are to draw up and adopt the 
charter of the oblast. What kind of charter we adopt, how much 
authority we take, that much will we have. Fatherland is on its 
own initiative drawing up its draft charter of the oblast. We 
have specialists of various schools. All are professionals: 
Questions of culture are being handled by G.F. Karpunin, chief 
editor of SIBIRSKIYE OGNI, and S.M. Dubrovin, director of the 
Art Gallery, military matters, by Major General V.A. Bagryanets, 
who has 16 government decorations, for Afghanistan and 
elimination of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station included. A very strong economic group from 
Akademgorodok, the National Economy Institute, and the 
Commercial Institute is working in our party. These are 
patriotic economists. They are working on alternative proposals 
and projects. 
  [Zharinov] And how is the new oblast soviet "written out" in 
your charter? 
  [Lyulko] It will all depend on who becomes a member of the 
oblast soviet. If the heads of administration become members, it 
will be a toothless appendage of the administration of the 
oblast, if deputies of Fatherland are members, I promise that it 
will be a militant, totally independent soviet pursuing an 
independent policy. Whoever has observed our Rossiya faction of 
deputies at work in the oblast soviet knows that we have never 
groveled before anyone, have pursued an independent policy in 
defense of the interests of the working people, displayed 
concern for the interests of the oblast.... 
  [Zharinov] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, do you allow of 
cooperation and interaction with other factions of deputies? 
  [Lyulko] We will cooperate not in the abstract but on 
specific matters. But there will undoubtedly be full interaction 
and cooperation between us and the Agrarian Party of Russia. An 
arrangement whereby we will support its candidates for deputy, 
and they, ours, has been arrived at. Generally, however, we are 
prepared to cooperate with all constructive parties and 
movements. 
  [Zharinov] Have you succeeded in resolving anything in point 
of substance as a deputy of the oblast soviet? 
  [Lyulko] Practically everything that I promised the 
electorate--and I promised only practicable things--I have done. 
For example, I promised to fight the plunder of Novosibirsk 
Oblast and exports overseas of natural resources and raw 
material. And I can say that at each session I raised the 
question of an end to the plan to export to Germany valuable 
natural raw material and peat from Chulymskiy Rayon's Guskovskiy 
Ryam. I ensured that a scandal was raised and that material 
indicating the illegality of this deal was publicized, and the 
exports of the raw material were terminated. 
  [Zharinov] You are opposed to exports of any raw material? 
  [Lyulko] I am opposed to exports of raw material. We need to 
export products. Were Guskovskiy Ryam to be destroyed, this 
would signify ecological catastrophe in the oblast. 
  [Zharinov] What else has been done? 
  [Lyulko] Restoration of the A. Nevskiy Cathedral, 
organization of the first volunteer Saturday work days. The 
Nikolskaya Chapel--the center of the Russian Empire--the Shrine 
of the Shroud in the city center--this is all our doing. We were 
the first to raise the question of a ban on pornography. Why 
should our children, the children of normal parents, watch 
pornography spread by sick people? 
  And we are not confining ourselves to prohibitions, what is 
more. I together with my friends have organized the publication 
and distribution of Orthodox literature of high artistic merit. 
I am proud that it was we who published the first works in the 
Soviet Union of the Russian thinker I.A. Ilin and then books of 
Ioann Kronshtadtskiy, S. Nilus, and others which had not 
previously been published anywhere. 
  We organized in the oblast soviet a struggle for the 
safeguarding of monuments. We have in our city, after all, many 
unique monuments of wooden architecture, which have been 
destroyed. We have at the present time begun to restore them 
with the Cossack Association. 
  Or take the fight against crime. Our faction, specifically 
S.A. Kovalev and myself, sought the appropriation of funds to 
purchase equipment, build a garage, and allocate housing for a 
special MVD subdivision. I participated in the creation of a 
Cossack security subdivision, which is now guarding certain 
plants. In addition, we have proposed to the administration the 
organization of patrols in the city on the basis of Cossack 
subdivisions. There were the volunteer public order squads and 
operational Communist Youth League detachments. These no longer 
exist. But I believe that our Cossacks (there are approximately 
500 men in the association) could combat hooliganism on the 
streets no less efficiently. After all, many of the Cossacks are 
former officers, and many of them distinguished themselves in 
the Dniester region and at the time of the last defense of the 
White House. 
  I was a member of the board of the Zavodskaya neighborhood, 
where I undertook the resolution of specific tasks in the 
district. Such as the renovation of apartments for the elderly, 
the asphalting of roads, and so forth. 
  Perestroyka has now hit the needy strata--retirees and large 
families--hard. In conjunction with the Russian Orthodox Church 
and Bishop Tikhon we organized Christmas and Easter festivities 
with the free distribution of gifts for large and needy 
families. Credit where credit is due, we were helped by the 
administration here. I.I. Indinok helped us purchase candy for 
the children and miscellaneous items. 
  [Zharinov] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, you and your family are 
believers? 
  [Lyulko] Yes. I myself initially understood that faith is 
essential. I began to go to church. Then my children and, 
together with them, my mother were baptized. Then my wife was 
baptized. And last summer we underwent a marriage ceremony at 
the Mogochinskiy Monastery....

<F P=106> [Letter by Oleg Morozov, political commentator of RESPUBLIKA </F>
TATARSTAN: "I Cannot Fail To Acknowledge"] 
  [Text] Today we publish a statement by Oleg Morozov, 
ex-candidate for deputy of the State Duma (according to 
preliminary results of the elections of 13 March--by now, a 
deputy) which he has sent to all newspapers of the republic and 
Kazan. This statement is a response to his opponents who held a 
press conference on 18 March at which they maintained that 
serious voting violations were allowed to occur, and in favor of 
just one candidate, Oleg Morozov. The statement is being 
published in full. 
  Esteemed fellow citizens! 
  On the evening of 18 March many of you had an opportunity to 
watch a TV report on a press conference in which my former 
opponents in the Moskovskiy Electoral District participated most 
vigorously [line(s) missing in the original]. The essence of 
their presentations boiled down to the fact that various 
violations occurred during the elections which place in doubt 
the very outcome of the elections. It is the prerogative of the 
district electoral commission to comment on the specific claims 
put forth by the participants in the press conference. I am no 
less interested than my opponents in getting exhaustive answers 
to all the questions. 
  However, I certainly cannot fail to acknowledge some, to put 
it mildly, improper pronouncements which affect me personally. 
  Let us begin with one participant in the press conference, 
M. 
Rameyev, who said approximately the following in support of his 
thesis that I was supported by the administrations of a number 
of rayons: People were forced to vote for Morozov, and for the 
sake of this they were paid wages they had not been paid since 
November. 
  I assert with the full weight of responsibility that, alas, 
I 
had nothing to do with an event as wonderful for many of my 
fellow residents as the payment of back wages. Moreover, I know 
that many labor collectives still have not received what is due 
to them. However, if we imagine for a minute that people were 
given the money they had earned on account of a modest 
individual like myself, this means that you, esteemed voters, 
have made a correct choice. 
  Another participant in the press conference, V. Belyayev, 
stated that it was allegedly indicated on the ballots in some 
polling stations that I am a resident of the city of Kazan. 
First, I would very much like to look at these ballots: I 
believe that they do not really exist. Second, I have never 
concealed the fact that I have resided in Moscow for the last 
four years--not in the official consent to run, not in 
interviews to newspapers, not at meetings with voters. As far as 
I know, the city of Kazan was erroneously indicated as my 
domicile by the newspaper VECHERNYAYA KAZAN, and then on the eve 
of the elections and in the context of a direct appeal to vote 
for V. Belyayev. I will recall that a sample ballot was 
published in which an appropriate mark was placed against 
Belyayev's name. 
  Likewise, Belyayev stated that his observers were not 
allowed 
access to polling stations; their work was allegedly interfered 
with, and their rights were not explained to them. I would not 
venture to maintain anything concerning all the observers of 
Vladimir Aleksandrovich. However, by a strange coincidence, at 
many of the city polling stations at which his comrades-in-arms 
were [line(s) missing in the original]. By an equally strange 
coincidence, both engaged in their activities without any 
hindrance and even cooperated quite peaceably, helping each 
other. 
  Esteemed voters, M. Rameyev also misleads you by maintaining 
that Morozov allegedly came fourth in virtually all the 
electoral precincts of Kirovskiy Rayon, but in total came in 
second. I cannot speak about all the polling stations of the 
rayon; however, according to the data obtained at precinct 
commissions, at the polling stations attended by my observers I 
came in first in two cases with a considerable lead, third in 
one case, and fourth with an insignificant lag behind the second 
and third positions in three cases. As you have already guessed, 
in total I came in second. 
  I will not refer to other "trifles." However, I cannot 
remain 
silent concerning one fundamental aspect reflecting the spirit 
of the press conference. As I see it, openly insulting 
intonations with regard to voters, especially those in rural 
rayons, were heard in the presentations of almost all of my 
opponents. Some, as they put it, "old Tatars," forcibly herded 
people into the polling stations and made them vote for the 
candidate they indicated. I will not comment on these 
statements, I am simply ashamed for those who think and talk 
about people, about their fellow residents, so pejoratively. 
  [Signed] With sincere respect, 
  Oleg Morozov, political commentator of RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Lukashov, Kazan, under rubric </F>
"Consequences": "The Election Has Occurred in Tataria: But the 
Nationalists Intend To `Start Everything From the Beginning'"] 
  [Text] All things considered, the re-election to the RF 
[Russian Federation] Federal Assembly that was held in Tataria 
on 13 March will have serious political consequences, and 
primarily for the Republic itself. The election that was held a 
month ago after the signing of a bilateral treaty had heated up 
the political passions, primarily in the Tatar 
national-patriotic movement. The nationalists felt that they had 
been betrayed once again: what appears to be insulting to them 
is the very fact that the president and the chairman of the 
Supreme Council of the "independent state of Tatarstan" will 
occupy deputy seats in the Upper House of the parliament of a 
"neighboring state," and they feel that it is doubly offensive 
that they received their mandates as deputies during the days of 
the holy month of Ramadan. 
  Local author Zulfat Khakim, in an open letter to President 
Shaymiyev that was published in SUVERENITET [Sovereignty] 
newspaper -- which is published by the radical committee of the 
same name -- wrote, "In the freedom-starved soul of the nation 
and in the history of our nation, you will be marked by black 
letters, and your descendants will say your name alongside of 
the name of Shah Ali (Ed. note: who surrendered Kazan to Ivan 
the Terrible) and other traitors of the Tatar nation..." 
  An associate of Khakim, Milli Medzhlis Chairman 
Fauziya Bayramova, in a telegram addressed to Nikolay Ryabov, 
chairman of the RF Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral 
Commission], and signed by representatives of five local 
nationalist organizations, remarked, "The unconstitutional 
election... has led to a state of civil war in Tatarstan." At a 
press conference Ms. Bayramova explained that by civil war she 
meant first of all the aggravation of the age-old conflict 
between the nomenklatura and the people: "But 
nevertheless there will be war. Society has already split up." 
  The nationalists say that, during the preparation and the 
holding of the election, they recorded numerous instances of 
violations. In the telegram addressed to Nikolay Ryabov it is 
stated that "in the course of the election campaign, the 
national bloc was completely deprived of the opportunity to 
carry out agitation; picketers were beaten up in Naberezhnyye 
Chelny; picketers were chased away in Kazan; rallies, meetings, 
and the preparation of agitation material were banned... The 
voters in the cities were threatened with nonpayment of their 
wages and with layoffs, and those in the villages were 
threatened with a refusal to be given any help in carrying out 
the springtime field operations. The most rigid censorship was 
established in the mass media." The bloc of national movements 
of the Tatar nation has called upon the international public to 
investigate the "legality of the scheduling of the election by 
RF authorities on the territory of Tatarstan, as well as the 
antidemocratic conditions in which the election was held." 
  All these facts, in the nationalists' opinion, indicate that 
official Kazan "wants to gain favor with Moscow" as a sign of 
gratitude for the treaty that was signed in February between 
Russia and Tataria. In the opinion of Ildus Amirkhanov, 
president of the All-Tatar Public Center (VTOTs), they also mean 
that "sovereignty has been trampled upon, and it is necessary to 
raise the struggle for the independence of Tatarstan, to begin 
everything from the beginning..." 
  The activization of national-patriotic forces in Tataria is 
occurring against a background of their unification. The same 
Ms. Bayramova, who calls herself a "national-democrat," is 
actively seeking points of contact with the local democrats, 
after apparently recalling the bygone times when most of the 
current political leaders existed under the aegis of the one and 
only opposition organization -- the People's Front of Tatarstan. 
The split into nationalists and into democrats proper occurred 
on the basis of the attitude toward the republic's sovereignty. 
In the opinion of Ms. Bayramova, the unification of all the 
oppositional forces is necessary so that "the scenario that was 
tested on 13 March does not get used in the forthcoming election 
to the People's Assembly of Tatarstan: if we lose this election 
also, then it will be necessary to say goodbye to democracy." 
  Currently the national-patriots are preparing documents 
concerning the violations in the course of the election, for the 
purpose of sending them to the court and to RF Tsentrizbirkom. 
Also engaged in this activity are the candidates for Moscow 
Electoral District No. 24 -- Yuriy Voronin, former first deputy 
chairman of the RF VS [Supreme Soviet], and political expert 
Vladimir Belyayev: on the basis of documentally confirmed data 
concerning violations, they consider the election of Oleg 
Morozov, former assistant first secretary of a CPSU oblast 
committee, as a deputy to the State Duma as never having 
occurred. In their opinion, the election in Tataria can be 
considered to have occurred, but it cannot be recognized as 
being completed.

<F P=106> [Report by Ye. Taran: "Such Diplomatic Bankers"] </F>
  [Text] A press conference of specialists from the 
largest Dresdner Bank in Europe and Banque Nacionale de 
Paris--here to participate in the seminar on banking 
business--was held yesterday in Kazan. 
  Naturally, journalists were interested not so much in the 
fine points of the banking business as in the prospects of 
cooperation between European banks and Tatarstan enterprises, 
and the possibility of receiving secured loans. However, neither 
the Dresdner Bank representative, Dr. Martini, who essentially 
answered all correspondents' questions, nor the rest of the 
press conference participants said anything specific in this 
respect. Western bankers intend first to study the situation in 
the Russian and Tatarstan economies and identify preferred 
investment projects, and only then to talk about money. 
  It seems, though, that even after the "study" one can hardly 
count on loans. For instance, according to Tatsotsbank Chairman 
of the Board Lyudmila Kitaitseva, Dresdner Bank representatives 
already had studied the possibility of extending credit and have 
not discovered any obstacles, but are in no hurry to begin 
working together. Interestingly enough, the Tatsotsbank still 
found foreign currency loan money for its clients--right here in 
Tatarstan. 
  Or this fact. During the Republic of Tatarstan delegation's 
visit to Germany a protocol of intentions was signed with 
Dresdner Bank on providing loans to Tatarstan for specific 
projects. Either the projects are not ready yet, or the German 
side has its doubts, but we still do not have these loans. At 
least Dr. Martini was unable to answer why intentions remained 
on paper. 
  By the way, foreign bankers did not conceal that right now 
they can only help us verbally and with papers (that is, 
educational materials on banking business); as to more 
substantial cooperation, this is a matter for the future. 
However, the possibility of opening branches of Dresdner Bank 
and Banque Nacionale de Paris in Tatarstan is currently under 
study. 
  Overall, however, our guests have displayed a truly 
diplomatic finesse: They answered journalists' questions for 
more than 40 minutes but said very, very little.

<F P=106> [Report by Republic of Tatarstan State Committee on </F>
Statistics and the Republic of Tatarstan Center for Social 
Problems: "In the Next Few Months, Life in Tatarstan Will Be 
Better Than in Russia"] 
  [Text] We continue the publication of materials on 
the standard of living of our republic's population. Let us 
recall that in these materials the standard of living is 
appraised by the criterion of the population's purchasing 
capacity as a ratio of income to the cost of living. The cost of 
living is determined by the system of consumer budgets. At this 
point, we are looking at only two of the entire range of 
consumer budgets: the subsistence minimum and the minimum 
consumer budget. 
  In February the subsistence minimum across Tatarstan 
increased by 16.1 percent (by 4,672 rubles [R] in absolute 
value) and amounted to R33,716 as compared to R29,044 in 
January, while the value of the minimum consumer budget amounted 
to R121,595. 
  According to data of the Republic of Tatarstan State 
Committee on Statistics, in the consumer market prices for 
consumer goods in February rose by 11 percent--a 1.5-fold rate 
increase as compared to January (7.8 percent). Prices rose for 
both foodstuffs (11 percent) and nonfood items (10.9 percent). 
Prices and fees for for-fee services for the population 
continued to rise at an anticipatory rate (44.4 percent). 
  At the same time, February is the month when the main 
indicators characterizing the standard of living--the cost of 
consumer budgets and income--fall into a predefined ratio; when 
income grows faster than prices for basic consumer goods and 
services included in the subsistence minimum. We remind the 
reader that throughout 1993 the republic was able to contain the 
anticipatory rise in per capita income in relation to increases 
in the cost of the subsistence minimum. For instance, on 28 
January we published in IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA the data that over 
12 months of last year the value of the subsistence minimum 
increased 7.3-fold (from R3,400 in January to R24,900 in 
December) while per capita income increased 9.7-fold (from 
R7,500 to R72,800). In January of this year, however, per capita 
income fell to R53,400 (we wrote about the reasons for this in 
IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA 1 March 1994), but in February the picture 
began to change gradually: Per capita income rose in February by 
40.2 percent and amounted to R74,870. The curve of changes in 
per capita income and the subsistence minimum are presented in 
the graph. One can see from the graph that over the entire last 
year per capita income in the republic rose at a higher rate 
than the cost of the subsistence minimum--a steeper "per capita 
income" curve in relation to "subsistence minimum" curve. 
Specialists of the Center for Social Problems have forecast the 
data for March-May. As we can see from the forecast, over the 
next two to three months, despite the general worsening of the 
economic situation in the Russian Federation, the republic will 
be able to maintain the trend of anticipatory rises in per 
capita income in relation to the rate of price increases for 
goods and services included in the subsistence minimum.

"Initiative": "President Ilyumzhinov Has Subordinated Himself to 
President Yeltsin: But He Will Remain With Kalmykia Until 
`Economic Stability' Arrives"] 
  [Text] Kalmykia President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov recently 
announced the liquidation of the Republic's Constitution and the 
Republic's resubordination to the Russian Constitution. He 
stated that the majority of the population supports his 
initiative concerning the repealing of the Republic's currently 
effective Constitution. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov also reported that 
the Republic's new Basic Law is in the process of preparation: 
this is the Great Steppe Code, the enactment of which means the 
practical liquidation of the Republic's sovereignty. The 
historic document that has been taken as the basis has been 
adapted to the realities of modern life and contains the 
following principles: the inseparable link with the nation of 
Russia (the impossibility of the Republic's secession from the 
Federation); RF [Russian Federation] citizenship; etc. The 
question of the president's status is in the process of being 
resolved. One possibility is that he will be confirmed by the RF 
president, that is, on the basis of his status he will be 
equated to an administration head. 
  President Ilyumzhinov, who was immediately christened by the 
Western SMI [mass media] as the "unifier of Russia," gave an 
interview to a SEGODNYA correspondent. 
  He reported that his appeal at an expanded session of the 
peoples of Kalmykia, at which he announced the repeal of the 
Republic Constitution, had "caused indignation on the part of 
the opposition." "Kalmyks suddenly felt that they were Kalmyks. 
Base nationalistic feelings sprang up. But the nation supports 
my decision, and the incompletely beaten opposition has crawled 
out: basically former Communists who are striving to gain power. 
It is they who are attempting to unsettle the situation. They 
have declared that I am a traitor, and have created a committee 
to save the Constitution," Mr. Ilyumzhinov said, stating that he 
is firmly resolved to "stop the theater of the absurd." 
  "I have ordered that the mass media publish everything, and 
later on we shall analyze it. Once again I want to demonstrate 
that, for me, power is not for the sake of power, but for the 
sake of the nation's well-being. Because I am the only president 
who does not receive any salary for occupying the position. I 
give my salary to a children's home. I wanted to demonstrate the 
same thing when I was in the White House on 3 and 4 October," 
the president stated. 
  According to Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, Moscow is "still looking 
at" 
his unexpected decision, which, he admits, not even his closest 
aides knew about. As for the other autonomous republics, so far 
as the president of Kalmykia knows, they are unanimous in 
censuring the step he took. 
  "I feel that in Russia there must be one president and one 
Constitution," he emphasized, remarking at the same time that "I 
shall not leave until economic stability arrives in Kalmykia. 
And, for the time being, everything is proceeding according to 
my scenario."

<F P=106> [Letter of Minister of Internal Affairs V. Yerin to First </F>
Deputy Minister of Economics of the Russian Federation A.G. 
Shapovalyants reported by the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA 
investigative service: "Now It Is Becoming Clear Why Ilyumzhinov 
Relinquished the Post of President of Kalmykia"] 
  [Text] To First Deputy Minister of Economics of the Russian 
Federation A.G. Shapovalyants Concerning Disclosures of 
Violations in the Use of Credit Resources of the Steppe 
Association. 
  Dear Andrey Georgiyevich! 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] of Russia is 
conducting a check on the fact of illegal use of state credit 
resources by a number of managers of state and commercial 
structures. 
  It has been preliminarily established that in 
September-November 1992 the Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation, on a petition of Rostekstil, the Russian state 
concern for the production of textile commodities, in the person 
of B.M. Fomin, president, issued a favorable special credit for 
the total sum of 14 billion rubles [R] to the Steppe Commercial 
Bank (Republic of Kalmykia). The indicated sum was intended for 
extending credit to enterprises of the Rostekstil concern for 
the purchase and processing of wool. 
  The redistribution of the credit resources of the commercial 
bank Steppe led to the fact that a basic sum of credit to the 
extent of R10.4 billion was received by the Steppe Association 
(Republic of Kalmykia), which is not part of the Rostekstil 
structure, and, in accordance with the contract, it fulfills the 
functions of a dealer organization of the concern. 
  In its turn, under the pretense of the purchase of wool, the 
Steppe Association concluded a number of contracts with 
commercial enterprises in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, 
and Nizhniy Tagil, stipulating a large interest fine for 
nonfulfillment of contractual conditions. Actually, fine 
penalties were a hidden form of payment of interest for credit 
received from the Steppe Association. 
  The return of credit resources to the Steppe Commercial Bank 
was scheduled for 26 April 1993. In connection with the fact 
that, owing to the squandering of credit monetary resources, the 
Steppe Association and, consequently, the Steppe Commercial Bank 
as well, were unable to pay off the existing indebtedness by the 
indicated date, the date for the return of credits was postponed 
on Fomin's petition, without adequate grounds, until the end of 
1993. 
  The measures that were conducted exposed the selfish 
interests of a number of senior officials of organs of authority 
and administration in the receipt and use of favorable credit 
resources. 
  In February of 1993, during registration of the San 
Corporation, a privately held joint-stock company with the 
rights of a trading house, the Rostekstil concern, its founder, 
acted as a juridical person and its president, B.M. Fomin--a 
holder of 15 shares of stock (7.5 percent) of the capital fund 
of the corporation--acted as one of its physical persons. 
  K.N. Ilyumzhinov (president of the Republic of Kalmykia at 
the present time) was elected president of the San Corporation. 
  For the purpose of extracting profits from the illegal use 
of 
credit resources, Ilyumzhinov opened the Steppe Commercial Bank 
in Elista, whose founder became the heads of commercial 
enterprises: the San Corporation, TOO [limited partnership] 
Kiminek, and the Sar firm, and B.M. Fomin became a member of the 
board of the bank. 
  It should be noted that the capital fund of the Steppe 
Commercial Bank totaled R150 million, of which R100 million was 
money stolen earlier through false credit advice notes by S. B. 
Terloyev and L. Yuferev, managers of the commercial enterprises 
APKO [not further identified] Cosmos and AO [joint-stock 
company] Continent, which embezzled a grand total of more than 
R20 billion. 
  Simultaneously with the opening of the Steppe Commercial 
Bank, Ilyumzhinov, also with Fomin's assistance, organized the 
Steppe Association, whose activity amounted to the accumulation 
and resale of substantial monetary resources at the expense of 
allocated state credit resources. 
  At the present time, without conducting documentary 
inspections, it is impossible to determine the total damage 
caused the state by the illegal use of credits, and also the 
profit received by the Steppe Association. However, it is 
already known now that Ilyumzhinov and his circle, under the 
guise of purchasing wool, conducted a concealed conversion of 
monetary resources for a total sum of more than $7 billion with 
the subsequent placement of hard currency in the accounts of 
foreign firms, including R2.5 million to the personal account of 
a private person in the Republic of Poland. To the present time, 
the foreign partners have not fulfilled their obligations to 
deliver wool and food products, and they are continuing to use 
the currency for their personal purposes. 
  It should be noted that the Aquarius System Interface 
joint-stock company (city of Moscow) whose manager, T.I. 
Gasanov, was the minister of industry in Ilyumzhinov's 
government, was involved in the conversion and transfer of hard 
currency to Poland. 
  At the present time, a check is being made on the fact of 
delivery of industrial commodities to the Steppe Association 
from the Gender firm for the sum of $250,000 under the guise of 
humanitarian assistance. 
  Citizen V. Dzhambinov, who is the deputy to the permanent 
representative of the president of Kalmykia under the president 
of Russia, participated in the receipt and sale of the goods in 
question. 
  There are reasons to believe that the Gender firm purchased 
the "humanitarian" assistance in question for hard currency 
received earlier from Ilyumzhinov. 
  Dzhambinov transferred the R95 million from the sale of the 
received commodities to the Steppe bank (to the current account 
of the Ilyumzhinov fund), and R40 million through false 
documents to the city of Moscow for the Tau firm. 
  Preliminary analysis of available materials of 
financial-economic activity of the commercial enterprises under 
the control of Ilyumzhinov makes it possible to reach a 
conclusion concerning the lack of any kind of substantial 
monetary resources at his disposal to pay off the indebtedness 
for credit in the full amount, and, what is more, using them for 
the development of the republic's economy. 
  [Signed] Minister V. Yerin 
  From the editorial office: NOVAYA 
YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA have written more 
than once about K. Ilyumzhinov's "shady" funds and affairs. 
However, the president of Kalmykia, in dissolving the soviets, 
was useful to B.N. Yeltsin in the spring and summer of 1993. 
Now, after his demonstrative friendship with A. Rutskoy, and in 
view of the new strategy of the Kremlin ("Give back the 
sovereignty that you at one time gulped down"), Ilyumzhinov is 
being worked over. In the beginning, the criminal funds did not 
intimidate the president of the Russian Federation, and now, 
with their exposure, Ilyumzhinov can be "broken," which has been 
done. The editorial office has in its possession a number of 
documents with the very highest endorsements. We will acquaint 
the readers of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA with them in the next 
few issues.

<F P=106> [Report by NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA investigative service </F>
(preparation and documents--Yakhya Akiyev): "Why Did Ilyumzhinov 
Raise the White Flag a Second Time? Almost a Criminal `Sorting 
Out' in the Kremlin"] 
  [Text] In the 18 March issue of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA, "Now It Is Clear Why Ilyumzhinov Relinquished the Post 
of President," we published a "report" of Minister of Internal 
Affairs V. Yerin which discusses the "shady" origin of funds of 
President of Kalmykia Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was noted in the 
editorial commentary that the shady origin of Ilyumzhinov's 
funds and his open disposition to engage in ventures in the 
reformation of Kalmykia absolutely did not interest either 
President Yeltsin, his circle, or the MVD-FCS [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs-Federal Counterintelligence Service] as long as 
Ilyumzhinov was considered one of them and a politically loyal 
leader of the republic. Today, we are continuing publication of 
the documents. On the one hand, those that throw light on the 
commercial activity of the president of Kalmykia, and on the 
other hand, those that demonstrate the mechanism for bringing 
Kremlin pressure to bear on the "formerly best, now fallen out 
of favor" marksman. 
  So, Document No. 1 
  This is a note by P. Filippov, manager of the 
Analytical Center of the Administration of the President of the 
Russian Federation. We are publishing the note in abridged form, 
and an exact copy of B.N. Yeltsin's endorsement on the first 
page of the document. 
  To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin 
<H5>  Analytical Note </H5>
  The socioeconomic and political situation in the Republic of 
Kalmykia--Khalmg Tangch. 
  Kalmykia is one of the most backward republics of the 
Russian 
Federation... The standard of living of the population is one of 
the lowest in Russia (the average wage in the republic in July 
of this year was 57 percent of the average Russian wage, and the 
housing fund is the worst in the Russian Federation). 
  The political situation is stable. Until very recently, the 
president of the republic enjoyed popular support. Numerous 
populist steps (the invitation to Dalai Lama XIV to take up 
permanent residence in the republic and to Ye. Gaydar regarding 
the post of premier) enable the president to maintain a high 
rating. 
  Unfavorable trends: 
  1. Concentration of power in the hands of the president. 
After disbanding the former Supreme Soviet, K. Ilyumzhinov 
formed a controllable parliament of 25 persons that could be 
dissolved in accordance with the constitution of the republic. 
After abolishing the soviets at all levels, the president 
introduced the institution of his own representatives in the 
localities. For all practical purposes, there is no opposition. 
  2. There is single control of the president over the economy 
of the republic. A big businessman with funds of an unclear 
origin, K. Ilyumzhinov even earlier controlled the economy of 
Kalmykia through the San corporation, the Steppe bank, regional 
departments of the Revival fund (of which he was president), and 
others. The plan of reorganization of Kalmykia into a single 
corporation is being put into effect by the president: A 
republic investment-industrial company has been created with a 
charter fund of $1 billion for the conduct of oil and gas 
extraction and securities operations. 
  3. Lack of detailed work on ambitious projects. Despite the 
announced reduction in the organs of state authority, 
expenditures on their maintenance increased in the refined 
budget for 1993 up to 4.6 percent against 1.9 percent in the 
initial variant.(...) 
  Given the lack of progress in the socioeconomic sphere, K. 
Ilyumzhinov chose the path of seeking rapid results in the 
sphere of foreign policy: activation of contacts with the 
diaspora, mediation in the Ossetia-Ingush conflict (...), an 
active position in the Federation Council and in the events of 
3-4 October of this year. 
  The most probable outcome of K. Ilyumzhinov's unsuccessful 
debut on the Moscow scene is the final switch to the opposition 
camp. 
  What is to be done, in the opinion of analysts? 
  1. Considering the full dependence of the republic on 
federal 
subsidies (in 1993, the share of subsidies in the income part 
was 86 percent, against 72 percent in the initial estimate), it 
is recommended: 
  --not to assume any kind of long-term obligations for 
granting subsidies and credits from the federal budget, 
benefits, and export licenses; build all financial-economic 
relations with the republic on a short-term basis; 
  --not to fix the extent of financial resources allocated 
from 
the federal budget in each succeeding interval; 
  --create a mechanism (possibly a negotiating one) that makes 
it possible to effectively correct assistance to the republic, 
depending on existing circumstances; 
  2. Distance ourselves from the personality of the president, 
temporarily reducing official contacts to a minimum; conduct all 
contacts with K. Ilyumzhinov exclusively as with the president 
of Kalmykia. 
  3. Introduce clarity in the origin of the personal funds and 
capital controlled by K. Ilyumzhinov (...) 
  [Signed] P. Filippov, director of the center 
  Thus, remaining distant from Ilyumzhinov, publishing 
compromising material, and making the financing of Kalmykia 
dependent on Ilyumzhinov's behavior--this is only a small 
arsenal of means of political pressure on a "component of the 
Federation." 
  Further, B.N. Yeltsin affixes his endorsement: "To V.S. 
Chernomyrdin. Very seriously. I request that you draw 
conclusions. Yeltsin. 18 November 1993." 
  V.S. Chernomyrdin circulates the note to the Cabinet of 
Ministers. Especially emphasizing instructions to V. Yerin. V. 
Yerin, understanding everything, sends a letter to the Ministry 
of Economics with an enumeration of K. Ilyumzhinov's 
machinations, which have been known for a long time, but which 
are being kept quiet for the time being. 
  The machine has been cranked up. Chebotarev, deputy 
chief of the Main Administration for Organizational Crimes, 
dispatches a paper to First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank 
Kulikov. We quote in an abridgement (numerous firms have been 
omitted through which Ilyumzhinov put state money "to 
work"). 
<H5>  On Designating Inspections </H5>
  In September and November 1992 the Government of the Russian 
Federation, by petition of the Ministry of Economics and the 
Rostekstil concern, allocated a special favorable credit in the 
sum of R14 billion to the Steppe commercial bank of the Republic 
of Kalmykia... The date of payment of the credit was set for 26 
April 1993. The Steppe association, instead of using the money 
specially for the purchase of wool, sold R9.4 billion to various 
commercial structures in the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, 
and Nizhnyy Tagil at an interest rate of 80 percent and higher. 
  The sale of credits was conducted by the Steppe association 
under the pretext of contracts concluded with commercial 
structures on joint activity. 
  In April 1993 the Steppe KB [commercial bank], after 
presenting documents that the credit resources received were 
being used as designated, albeit slowly, in connection with 
objective difficulties, submitted a petition to the Central Bank 
of the Russian Federation for an extension of the date for 
return of the credit until December 1993. The petition was 
supported by the National Bank of Kalmykia and the joint-stock 
company Rostekstil. As a result, the date for returning the 
credit was extended to 1 December 1993, even though wool for 
monetary resources in the sum of R9.4 billion allocated to the 
Steppe association has not even now arrived at enterprises of 
the Rostekstil concern. (...) 
  On 18 December 1992 the Steppe association, with payment 
authorization No. 8, transferred R914 million to the joint-stock 
company TIM according to a contract for joint activity in wool 
purchasing. The TIM joint-stock company used the received 
monetary resources to purchase citrus fruit in Spain and sell it 
in CIS countries. On the instructions of the association, part 
of the monetary resources of $250,716 in currency was 
transferred by the TIM joint-stock company in May 1993 to Warsaw 
to the People's Bank of Poland, account No. 62828, and the rest 
of the monetary resources, after the sale of the citrus fruit, 
was returned with interest to the Steppe association. (...) 
  (...) On 25 December 1992 the Steppe association, on the 
basis of the contract on joint activity, transferred R1 billion 
for the purchase of wool to the joint-stock company Aquarius 
Systems Interface. After converting the given sum to $2,328,605, 
the joint-stock company Aquarius Systems Interface, according to 
a contract for the purchase of canned products, transferred the 
aforementioned sum to Warsaw to the People's Bank of Poland, 
account No. 628288. According to the contract, the Steppe 
association was supposed to receive the products. However, there 
are no documents in the Aquarius Systems Interface joint-stock 
company that confirm the receipt of products by the Steppe 
association. 
  Moreover, there are data at the present time indicating that 
about R2 billion were converted to $2.9 million and transferred 
to foreign banks through other commercial structures. 
  Thus, the acquired credit was not used for what it was 
designated: Examinations conducted earlier were not objective, 
which made it possible for the aforementioned structures to 
extend the credit contract to 1 December 1993. 
  In connection with the aforementioned, I request an 
examination of the issue of cessation of the prolongation of 
credit, the imposition of penalty fines for nonfulfillment of 
obligations to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and a 
decision on the possibility of designating and conducting a bank 
inspection for verification of the grounds for the receipt of 
credit, its extension, and the further movement of these 
resources. 
  [Signed] First Deputy Chief G.F. Chebotarev 
  We do not know how the "sorting out" ended. K. 
Ilyumzhinov, who is passionately striving for the independence 
of Kalmykia, calling it "the second Kuwait," unexpectedly for 
everyone, suddenly, abrogated the republic's constitution, 
stripped himself of the title of president, took the modest 
title of governor, and returned the entire "gulped" sovereignty. 
  And no criminal case is being brought with respect to 
Ilyumzhinov. 
  It is interesting: If Ilyumzhinov had not gone with a 
white flag to Rutskoy, would he remain president, or not? And 
what would his questionable financial operations be called? 
Perhaps, "an ability to manage economically and live in a new 
way?" And some analytical note most likely would say that 
"despite the dubious origin of funds (...) Ilyumzhinov's high 
degree of loyalty to the existing authorities should be taken 
into account..."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Dubinin by Ivan </F>
Zasurskiy; place and date not given: "Sergey Dubinin Will Pursue 
Last Year's Government Policy: The Government Contract at 
Enterprises of the Military-Industrial Complex Is Six to Seven 
Times in Excess of the Ministry of Defense's Ability To Pay"] 
  [Text] Following the resignation of Boris Fedorov, 
everything in the Ministry of Finance has been slotted into 
place. Having handled the work of a minister in the times of 
Fedorov (who was preoccupied, in my view, more with ideology and 
political struggle than routine ministerial matters), Dubinin 
became a full minister, virtually. The protracted probationary 
period is, according to him, hampering his work, but not 
influencing the nature of the decisions he makes. 
  Dubinin does not consider himself a politician. He is a 
government official. And he maintains that the sole reason why 
he agreed to the office of minister is that he will have an 
opportunity to do his work. As soon as this opportunity 
disappears or he is asked to leave the cabinet, Dubinin intends 
leaving the government. And I would not be inclined to doubt the 
sincerity of these words. But this is not what is most important. 
  The greatest optimism in the acting finance minister is 
inspired by his arrangement of his work priorities. I would like 
as a significant contrast for those who recall the dramatic 
nature of the situation connected with Fedorov's speech in 
parliament to quote Dubinin's composed words on his "production" 
topics: "That lobbying for one's interests in the government and 
the State Duma goes on is normal, but only as long as we can 
discuss these demands at a professional level, as long as we can 
come to some arrangement. But as soon as the decisions are 
politicized, the budget discussions assume a different 
character, as a rule, becoming a catalyst of confrontational 
political processes." 
  According to him, Dubinin has no intention of being a 
striking figure and is not about to "develop a fondness or not 
develop a fondness" for Chernomyrdin, Zaveryukha, Soskovets, or 
Gerashchenko. "I have a wife, whom I love very much, and all 
these others will remain working relationships, as will possible 
disagreements also." 
  His following semi-culinary statement may be considered 
fundamental for Dubinin's position both in respect to the budget 
and in respect to economic policy: "Whenever the question of the 
distribution of expenditure arises, there is always with us the 
`zero-sum game' problem--we can give to some only by having 
taken away from others. But this game, inasmuch as it is played, 
should lead us to some end result in the form of economic 
growth. In this case the pie which we divide up would grow. Now, 
however, the pie is diminishing: In real terms we are observing 
not growth but shrinkage." 
  Lobbyists who have called Dubinin--who is demonstrating a 
total absence of political ambitions--"Mr. No Money" will 
hardly, it would seem, be struck by the difference between 
Fedorov, who had made a political career out of "refusals," and 
Dubinin--the "man of compromise." 
<H5>  The Budget as a Concentrated Expression of Economic Policy </H5>
  "There is, in fact, no budget message as yet. There is a 
report of the Ministry of Finance on the draft budget with 
calculations elaborated in the form of an international 
classification. 
  "It is a very serious report and it was worked up over a 
long 
period in the Ministry of Finance, and we in the Ministry of 
Finance are absolutely convinced that we are offering the sole 
possible balanced path. Following the consideration of certain 
amendments and criticisms expressed at a meeting of the 
government and not affecting the most prominent calculations and 
important proportions, we were instructed to submit the draft 
for examination by the State Duma. 
  "In drawing up the budget for 1994 we proceeded from the 
fact 
that our budget revenue really needed to be collected. The 
revenue figure contained in the draft, therefore--R120.7 
trillion (16 percent of gross domestic product)--is realistic. 
And the main task of the Ministry of Finance this year will be 
organization of the collection of receipts totaling this amount. 
  "I can already see the main points of the criticism of our 
draft message in the State Duma. One of them has been criticism 
as regards the practicability of the revenue for which we have 
allowed. That is why it should be added to what has been said 
that the collection of receipts will be impossible without 
elementary financial discipline having been instituted. We must 
ultimately know the money path and the number of enterprises' 
accounts and fight tax evasion. 
  "The situation taking shape as regards expenditure is quite 
typical. When we began to work on the budget, applications for 
funding totaling about R600 trillion were received. This despite 
the fact that the forecast level of our GNP is R725 trillion. 
  "After quite laborious work on the applications, we managed 
to knock their level down to R230 trillion. But this was still 
very high, it represented too serious a deficit against our 
revenue, which was less by a factor of two almost than the 
residual total. 
  "We had to make an uneven reduction in expenditure in terms 
of items of the budget. Not in terms of all items, it is true 
(our foreign and domestic debt could not, for understandable 
reasons, be touched), but in terms of very many we `contracted 
funding' 5-10 percent. But individual items were cut far more 
significantly. I could, as an example, cite the Ministry of 
Defense, where we reduced expenditure from R87 trillion to R37 
trillion. We cannot, in fact, have an army whose manning level 
is not supported by the birth rate and whose cost is equal to 
the sum total of taxes collected in the country. 
  "In this way we gradually managed to reach the compromise 
level of expenditure of R183.1 trillion. The largest expenditure 
items within this framework were support for the sectors (R33 
trillion), Ministry of Defense expenditure (R37 trillion), 
assistance to other levels of power (R18 trillion), and the 
funding of social and cultural programs (following insertion of 
the corresponding proposals, we increased the funding from R11.4 
trillion to R12.5 trillion)." 
  Commenting on Viktor Chernomyrdin's directive in respect to 
support for the agrarian sector, Sergey Dubinin declared that 
"this is a large amount of money, of course, for which we had to 
provide additionally in the budget--over and above our original 
proposals. All this was, it is true, accommodated in the draft 
message. But the additional demands have no real foundation, in 
my view. That is, we reached the level originally requested by 
the agrarians: They said that this was perfectly sufficient for 
them. And if voices are now being heard to the effect that this 
is still not enough for them, it is essential, in my opinion, 
that the government adopt the toughest position possible on this 
issue: This is all that we can give them." 
  "The deficit constituted R62.4 trillion, which it is 
contemplated covering by Central Bank credit (R37.9 trillion), 
external sources (R19.4 trillion), and securities transactions 
(R3.5 trillion), and we hope to cover a further R1.5 trillion 
from other sources." According to Dubinin, the Ministry of 
Finance is planning this year, aside from work with state 
commercial associations, to begin floating medium-term bills. 
  "From our viewpoint, the draft budget message contains the 
algorithms of a resolution of macroeconomic problems and takes 
account of the available possibilities for the pursuit of a 
structural policy, which is undoubtedly necessary," the acting 
finance minister said in the interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
<H5>  Macroeconomic Reference Points </H5>
  "The macroeconomic aspects of the budget are that with the 
budget deficit that we have determined and provided that we 
display restraint in the allocation to the economy of Central 
Bank credit (R15 trillion, approximately, is the critical level 
here, in my view), we may confidently forecast a reduction in 
inflation to a level of 15 percent and, subsequently, to 10 
percent a month and, perhaps, even lower on a quarterly average. 
  "The draft budget we have submitted for government 
consideration is not `fundamentalist.' It is not even purely 
monetarist inasmuch as such measures as the suppression of 
inflation within one quarter are absent. Although this is not 
that intricate an undertaking, we possess the set of instruments 
and could within a quarter reduce inflation to nothing. Just as 
we could also, if necessary, drive it up to 1,000 percent a 
month--both could, from the professional viewpoint, be done in 
such a timeframe. But this is not the point. 
  "The point is that our tasks, reference points, and range of 
activity imply the pursuit, more precisely, the continuation of 
our policy of last year. That is, there is no `shock 
therapy'--there is quite a strict monetary policy. 
  "I would like to emphasize that the budget is a concentrated 
expression of economic policy. Aside from the priorities from 
the sphere of macroeconomic stabilization, the tasks of support 
of production and its structural reorganization have been added 
here this year. 
  "Going further than we have gone to satisfy the need for 
money would be just as bad as a further reduction in spending. 
In the latter case we would have to abandon many fundamentally 
important items of expenditure, in the social sphere 
specifically." 
<H5>  Structural Aspect </H5>
  "We believe that within the framework of the gradually 
declining level of inflation there is for industry, and the 
economy as a whole, a certain clearance, in which it should 
structurally reorganize. We are not putting it in a catastrophic 
position all at once--this, strictly speaking, is the 
`structural' aspect of our draft budget message. 
  "Very little money is being provided from the budget for 
specific enterprises--we are giving almost nothing. The sectors 
of the economy will receive less, appreciably less, I would say, 
than they would like. 
  "We understand full well an important feature of Russia's 
enterprises today. What would happen, say, were we to say to 
them: Here is your government support, reorganize as you please, 
and we will combat inflation later. They would do absolutely 
nothing--they would live as they did before." 
  The creation of financial and industrial groups could, in 
Dubinin's opinion, be an element of selective support for 
industry. But the process of the allocation of financial support 
and tax privileges should be of a planned nature, Dubinin 
believes. "Such groups may enjoy support to some extent. But the 
main thing is that they be viable without a handout from the 
budget also." 
  "The sectors are an unsuccessful (under present conditions) 
form of association and management. They represent a vertical 
association, which can do nothing but divide up a market between 
itself. If, however, we could combine these enterprises on the 
basis of production cooperation, we would get a normal 
industrial concern, which would operate in accordance with 
economically expedient principles." 
  In Dubinin's opinion, work exclusively for the foreign 
market 
is not a compulsory condition of the efficiency of a financial 
and industrial group. "The Russian market is potentially so 
great that this is sufficient stimulus for economic growth for 
any structure. The sole condition is that there must be a 
struggle to cut costs. Lowering prices or not lowering them is, 
strictly speaking, secondary." A reduction in costs, according 
to Dubinin, is a most powerful "nonmonetary" method of combating 
inflation. 
  Commenting on the propositions of the president and the 
prime 
minister concerning an increase in government investments, 
Sergey Dubinin declared that the budget of R33 trillion in 
support of the sectors makes provision for R15.7 trillion for 
government investments. A further R12.7 trillion will be 
invested along the lines of foreign economic activity, thanks to 
tied credit. 
<H5>  The New Role of the Unions and the `Destructive Approach' </H5>
  "I have met recently with representatives of the unions and 
the strike committees--pragmatic and intelligent people are 
assembled there, according to my observations. And the question 
is: On what will their energy be expended? Were they to acquire 
an opportunity to really influence the situation at their own 
enterprises, an appreciable part of their energy would be geared 
to bringing order to bear there. They would also be very much 
helping both the government and the country as a whole, what is 
more, having put their own management under supervision." 
  This, according to the acting minister, "does not mean that 
management should be denied any rights at the enterprise. But 
opponents in the shape of the unions, which know the whole 
situation at the enterprise `from within' and could demand an 
accounting, are necessary. This could only be to the good." 
  "If, on the other hand, these people (I emphasize once 
again: 
very energetic and competent people, who have a pretty good 
grasp of all our economic problems, incidentally) opt for the 
line of opposition to the government and the shaking loose of 
privileges for their own interest group, this will be a 
destructive process." 
  Dubinin is very much concerned that the strike movement 
"could assume a destructive nature both politically and for 
Russia's economy." The acting minister believes that not all the 
demands being made by the strikers are realistic and that, 
consequently, not all of them should be satisfied. "The 
government cannot endlessly give in to blackmail." But does the 
government today have any choice? 
  "Yes. But, please understand, our strength lies not in some 
power methods of the resolution of disputes but, occupying a 
sensible and substantiated position, in conveying its content to 
those who participate, in this way or the other, in budget 
discussions. 
  "For every `we-want'-from-the-government argument there 
should be a counterargument: Let us take at look at and consider 
what we are realistically capable of doing. It is for this 
reason that the budget should be relatively widely known: People 
must think and say where to cut, where to add," Sergey Dubinin 
believes. 
<H5>  Parliament </H5>
  "In principle, work on the allocation of priorities and the 
careful weighing of society's needs is the function of 
parliament. Parliament must determine whether it will adopt the 
budget that we propose. It will thus act as an inspector on 
behalf of the people by whom it was elected." 
  Commenting on his style of work with parliament during 
consideration there of the budget message, Sergey Dubinin said: 
"I state with all due responsibility that we are instructed by 
the prime minister to work with parliament with complete candor, 
respond to inquiries, and so on and so forth. When each deputy 
forwards his inquiry on an individual point and demands a full 
response, this is another matter--our ministry simply is not in 
a position to cope with this entire avalanche of information. 
  "For this reason we request that parliament somehow organize 
work with the ministry to ensure that it be performed as 
productively as possible. We are prepared to provide any 
information, to the Budget Committee, say--and let it further 
distribute it to the deputies. We are prepared to create a 
special department--not to fence ourselves off from contacts but 
to ensure that work proceed in organized fashion. 
  "Time is weighing on us, we submitted the budget late, this 
was our fault, it should have been submitted in this form in 
December. But we recomputed the budget for last year three times 
and made innumerable adjustments and revisions and we simply 
physically lacked the forces for 1994." 
<H5>  The Expert Center in Staraya Ploshchad </H5>
  Commenting at the request of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the 
formation of the Finance and Budget Department under the Office 
of the President of the Russian Federation, Sergey Dubinin 
declared that he finds this fact logical and sees nothing 
surprising in it, to put it mildly. 
  "The office of the president should necessarily have an 
expert center, which should make an independent evaluation of 
the state of the economy--based on all that is put at its 
disposal by the government, science, and so forth." 
  Answering questions concerning the possible development of 
relations between the Ministry of Finance and the department, 
the acting minister said: "What we send the president will in 
the office obviously be readdressed quite often to this 
department. For the president's response to this economic 
situation or the other to be as well-founded as possible 
analysis is essential. This analysis will be made in this 
department. This is how I see it, in any event. 
  "Because the president could give us an order, set the 
government an assignment--this is his function. And these 
instructions could be prepared with the participation of the 
Finance and Budget Department." 
<H5>  Money for the Republic of Belarus </H5>
  "I was involved in these matters for quite some time, and 
this is quite a painful subject for me, therefore. I would like 
to hope that all will end normally and that the necessary 
documents will be signed." 
  But the existence of the National Bank of Belarus is an 
insurmountable obstacle to the signing of the treaty, in his 
opinion. "Prior to the start of the process of the conclusive 
concordance of the agreement on the Republic of Belarus entering 
the ruble zone, its parliament adopted a decision on support for 
the agrarian sector in quite a large sum. Naturally, the 
National Bank is bound to comply with parliament's order. Let us 
assume that we allocate the Republic of Belarus a lending quota. 
What if parliament adopts a decision on above-quota lending?" In 
Dubinin's opinion, it can only be a question of a branch of the 
Bank of Russia on the territory of Belarus. But Dubinin hopes 
that the adoption of such a political decision is possible, for 
all that. "The politicians, who have doubts about sacrificing 
some sovereignty in exchange for the ruble, should, probably, 
somehow learn the people's opinion here. The adoption of a 
decision by parliament representing the people's interests or 
putting the issue to a referendum, as was done in the EEC, 
appear entirely legitimate, in my view." 
  At the same time, on the other hand, Dubinin considers far 
from unequivocal the question of the likely price ratio of the 
"rabbit" to the ruble. 
  "This is purely an economic question. We should not 
politicize it or attempt to give it an emotional coloration. The 
current rate has taken shape as the rate of the currency of an 
independent state against a stronger currency. And this rate is 
not one for one, of course, although for Belarus' enterprises 
exchange at a high rate would mean a loss of competitiveness. 
For this reason Belarusian industrialists do not aspire to such 
a rate, incidentally. As distinct from the populace, which is 
already attuned to this. 
  "The rate remains a matter for separate consideration, and 
various options are possible here: higher for the public, for 
example, lower for industry. But not one `rabbit' for one ruble." 
<H5>  The Tatarstan Compromise and Budget Federalism </H5>
  Responding to the question as to what compromises had to be 
made by the center for the sake of preserving the multichannel 
system of budget receipts with Tatarstan, Sergey Dubinin said: 
"Strictly speaking, abandonment of the single-channel system was 
itself a compromise. Because in the past Tatarstan had said that 
a single-channel system was the sole acceptable option. 
  "We, in response, recognized two things. First, the fact 
that 
for the time in which Tatarstan had not paid money to the 
federal treasury it had maintained federal structures on its 
territory. We should compensate this somehow. 
  "Second, as of this year Tatarstan will begin to pay many 
taxes on a general basis (in accordance with the presidential 
edict on transfer payments). We, in turn, for the funding of 
programs of a federal purpose in Tatarstan will leave on its 
territory the receipts from certain taxes." Specifically, 
according to the acting minister, this applies to receipts from 
taxes on natural resources. 
  "We shall not settle this question identically for everyone, 
but it should be emphasized that the negotiating process with 
Tatarstan proceeded in a general channel. I am speaking in this 
case of the presidential edict on transfer payments, by which 
real federalist budget reform was undertaken." 
<H5>  Tax Federalism </H5>
  "The essence of this reform (and the renunciation of budget 
unitarism) is that we are abandoning the policy of the 
harmonization of spending and switching to revenue-sharing. We 
are making arrangements such that there be federal taxes and 
taxes collected on a territory and paid into the local budget. 
  "Some federal taxes, primarily the profits tax, will be 
shared. A maximum rate of the local profits tax (25 percent) and 
a strict federal rate (13 percent) will be established. Thus 
with the maximum profits tax at 38 percent the local authorities 
may vary its rate from 13 to 38 percent. 
  "Value-added tax [VAT] will be shared. Twenty-five percent 
of 
VAT will remain on the territory. Land and property taxes 
should, most likely, simply be made local taxes because they 
will go to the territory in full. Individual income tax will be 
established as a federal tax, although only 1 percent will be 
paid into federal coffers." 
  According to Dubinin, tax evasion remains a huge problem, 
and, specifically, it is altogether elementary to evade 
individual income tax. "You can pay in on deposit R10 and accrue 
R1 million in interest on it, and you pay nothing here. We must 
combat this. Certain taxes on interest, if only at a rate of 5 
percent, have to be imposed. Although, with the change in the 
status of the Savings Bank to a state bank, provision for 
certain privileges for its depositors could be made here. But 
this is an open, albeit urgent, question." 
<H5>  The Nonpayments Crisis </H5>
  In Dubinin's opinion, the arrears "are the result of the 
fact 
that demand limitations really did emerge. But the response in 
1992--when this problem became particularly serious--was 
inadequate and nonmarket. The producers continued to drive up 
prices and wait for the government to finally untie this knot in 
some way. 
  "Inasmuch as the entire economy was nonmarket at that time, 
the government had to intervene--and we established that 
`swollen' price level. We thereby involuntarily encouraged the 
antimarket policy of the producer, who, according to these 
rules, can drive up prices because he is sure that they will 
some day be accepted. 
  "We are now in roughly the same situation. If we intervene, 
we cause a most powerful spiraling of inflation. And no one 
would any longer believe that we would not pay all costs once 
again the next time." 
  The Ministry of Finance's proposals amount to the "complete 
exclusion" of the possibility of a reciprocal settlement thanks 
to special money issue. "But we support, in principle, the 
possibility of the use to this end of resources which within the 
framework of public funding are allocated for the defense 
contract, for example. We believe that in purchasing grain or 
meat products the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and other 
departments are required to build a chain in order that this 
money pass into the economy as deeply as possible. But only 
defense industry and the Ministry of Railways are prepared to 
undertake this as yet. The rest are so much not in possession of 
their sector that they could not propose anything practicable. 
  "The second necessary set of measures is connected with the 
institution of strict financial discipline (about which I spoke 
earlier). The creditor must know for what he can bring suit--and 
if there is no money, he can take assets. It is obvious that it 
is essential to introduce bills of exchange as soon as possible 
also." 
  In Dubinin's opinion, the time allotted for the solution of 
this question is already slipping away, although there are 
entirely objective grounds for procrastination also. According 
to him, for the introduction of the calendar sequence of 
payments it is necessary to revise the decision of the Supreme 
Soviet. Other legislative instruments need to be adopted also, 
in his opinion. "The proposals of the tax office, the Ministry 
of Finance, and the Central Bank of Russia have now been sent to 
the State Duma." 
  According to Dubinin, the formation of a new problem in the 
style of the nonpayments--a recurrence of last year's problems 
with the failure to pay for supplies of finished products--is 
emerging. In this case the culprit is the Ministry of Defense, 
which placed at the enterprises a defense order of a size six or 
seven times in excess of the budget's ability to pay for these 
items. 
<H5>  Negotiations with the IMF </H5>
  As a result of Fedorov's efforts to concentrate the 
functions 
of participation in international affairs in the Ministry of 
Finance, the role of the ministry in negotiations with the 
Seven, the EEC, and international economic organizations has 
grown considerably. 
  "The Ministry of Finance is having to take an active part in 
the assurance of favorable foreign economic conditions for the 
activity of the Russian economy. Negotiations on debt 
rescheduling, formulation of the optimum formats of the receipt 
and repayment of foreign credit--this is one aspect. 
  "The second consists of negotiations with the IMF, the World 
Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and 
other financial organizations." 
  In Dubinin's opinion, Russia has today found itself involved 
in quite an intricate interweave of problems, to which the 
departure of symbolic figures from the cabinet has been added 
also. In this connection Dubinin is quite sharply critical of 
those who advocate a dismissive attitude toward international 
financial organizations. "Without harmonization of positions 
with the IMF Russia could not obtain normal conditions for debt 
deferral. The debt burden, which has built up since the times of 
the Soviets, would be simply insupportable. We would be 
threatened constantly by a total embargo and, if not a blockade, 
a serious deterioration in the climate of foreign economic 
relations." At the same time Dubinin observes that negotiations 
should always be of a mutually respectful character. "Russia 
itself formulates its evaluation of economic policy and its 
basic directions within the framework of current possibilities. 
International experts only offer us their opinion on these 
matters." 
  Dubinin described in the interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
the trip of a Russian delegation under his leadership to 
Frankfurt, to a get-together of finance ministers of the Seven. 
Present on the Russian side, aside from Dubinin, were 
Gerashchenko and Shokhin. According to Dubinin, Shokhin had been 
invited in order to "space out the format" of the Russian 
delegation and to emphasize its special status. "It seems to me 
that we accomplished our `three-man' mission--to explain the 
essence of the economic policy we are pursuing and its 
continuity at the level of figures and specific measures." 
  Negotiations with IMF, in which the Ministry of Finance and 
other departments responsible for the pursuit of economic policy 
are participating, are being conducted in Moscow at this time, 
according to Dubinin. "Their successful completion in the very 
near future is possible," according to the minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Borodulin: "The Government Intends to </F>
Increase the Number of Its Agents"] 
  [Text] The statements by members of the government 
about the need to increase investments in the economy in every 
way possible are gradually assuming specific characteristics. By 
yesterday, the Ministry of Economics had prepared as a minimum 
two documents aimed at attracting private capital to industry. A 
distinctive feature of them is that they are oriented toward 
capital from Russian investors, not foreign investors. 
  The arsenal of funds at the government's disposal to 
stimulate investments is potentially quite extensive. First of 
all, there are the preferential investment credits, the various 
tax exemptions, the direct purchase of enterprises' securities 
and the issuance of state guarantees for the securities being 
issued. At the same time, experience shows that the first two 
methods prove to be ineffective--the credits (not reimbursable, 
as a rule) and tax exemptions are turned into a camouflaged form 
of state subsidies. The adherents of privatization see 
nationalization of enterprises in the purchase of stock shares 
by the government, and for this reason, the Goskomimushchestvo 
[State Committee on the Administration of State Property] reacts 
coolly toward such proposals. So the only real way at present is 
by granting state guarantees. 
  In this connection, Ministry of Economics specalists have 
prepared draft government decrees "On Specialized Institutions 
to Implement State Investment Policy" and "On the Council for 
Structural and Investment Policy Attached to the Russian 
Government and Agreement with an Investment and Financial 
Consortium." In the words of Leonid Paydiyev, who authored the 
first document, there is practically nothing that is new in the 
concept being worked out to attract private capital--it was 
utilized to one degree or another by the tsarist government when 
it built the railroads. 
  The concept being proposed essentially involves the creation 
of a state guarantee fund under the aegis of the Ministry of 
Economics. Special agents of the government will issue state 
guarantees on the securities for investment projects with shared 
participation by the state. Both state enterprises and 
investment companies (funds) may act in this role. In order to 
establish a broad network of agents, it was proposed to 
implement "measures to transform existing checking investment 
funds into investment companies, banks, and bank branches (with 
restrictions on commercial activity and clearing transactions)." 
  If this concept is considered from the viewpoint of 
interdepartmental relationships, it is apparent that such a 
radical version of restructuring the state investment system can 
expect a lengthy period of coordination, during which many of 
its elements either will disappear altogether or undergo 
substantial modification. For this reason, it is more likely 
that agreements between the government and the special 
investment and financial consortium which is being established 
will make their appearance in the very near future. 
  This was confirmed during a visit which Vice Premier 
Aleksandr Shokhin made to the KOMMERSANT Publishing House. In 
his words, the document should be signed as early as next week. 
Th government will put 500 billion rubles [R] into the 
consortium being created, and investment projects will be 
guaranteed. It is expected that establishment of the fund will 
help to attract private investments of R1.5 trillion. We note 
that in the event of "an insurance case," such as bankruptcy of 
an investment project, the funds to make up for an investor's 
losses will be transferred from the Federal Treasury in a 
procedure not requiring acceptance. 
  They are saying that the basic reason for the nearly 2 weeks 
of coordinating the document draft in the Ministry of Finance is 
that the machinery for the consortium's responsibility to the 
government was not worked through sufficiently. In the meantime, 
the actions by the minister of economics, who is insisting on 
approval of this document as quickly as possible, are easily 
explained--the launching of this project should provide evidence 
that the Chernomyrdin government is prepared to devote attention 
to stimulation of investments not only in words and with the aid 
of budgetary funds, but by establishing efficient "market" 
mechanisms.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Shchekochikhin, member of the Public </F>
Chamber under the Russian Federation President, by DELOVOY MIR 
columnist Valentin Khalin: "`I See Russia Without Poor People in 
Place of a Country Without Rich People'"] 
  [Text] Some 60 lines of text would be needed to list 
all of Viktor Shchekochikhin's titles: member of the Public 
Chamber under the Russian Federation President, owner of 
farmsteads and the "Zemlyane" Association, president of the 
Russian Union of Private Proprietors--he performs these and many 
other roles... DELOVOY MIR columnist Valentin Khalin talks with 
him. 
  I did not ask him how he has the time to cope with his 
roles. 
I did not ask because at the very beginning Viktor Vladimirovich 
noted casually: "I work 12 to 14 hours a day." A person of 
bubbling energy, he literally compresses time even further in 
the process. We met together on a Sunday and spent about 4 
hours, including a trip to the VDNKh (VVTs) [Exhibition of 
Achievements of the National Economy], where we viewed the 
farmstead exhibit, ate a quick cold lunch--bread, sausage, and 
coffee. 
  Though most of the business people I have had occasion to 
meet have roughly the same mentality and do not take the trouble 
to separate day from night. I was struck by something else. We 
had arranged to discuss problems in the development of free 
enterprise, but my interlocutor began speaking about... space. 
  "A national strategic objective can help Russia out of the 
chaos into which it has been plunged," he said. "Let us recall 
how the instigators of World War II were revitalized after the 
war. Germany counted on foreign loans and advanced 
technologies, Italy did practically the same thing, and Japan 
went into the fields of electronics and automotive 
manufacturing. The USSR lost "the cold war" and collapsed. For 
the world of today, this geopolitical cataclysm is like the fall 
of the Roman Empire was for the ancient world. Then the people 
were plunged into the dismal Middle Ages for a long time. But 
today, Russia has retained a powerful reserve for a rapid 
revival. It has been and remains a great space power. And this 
invaluable potential must be utilized for all it is worth, as 
they say. Because it is the way to the future. Sooner or later 
harmful products and radioactive waste will be carried outside 
the limits of the atmosphere and energy will have to be obtained 
from new sources in the space near earth. Is it a coincidence 
that not only the United States, Russia, and the European 
countries, but China, India, and Japan have turned their 
attention to space? In this rush by all of mankind, Russia is 
among the first, and it has produced a valuable commodity. So 
why shouldn't we take advantage of it? We can and must receive 
sizable investments to go into space. Then the most advanced 
technologies will be required, the flywheel of the former VPK 
[military industrial complex] will begin rotating in the 
direction needed, plans will be revitalized, young persons will 
once again exert themselves in fiztekh, the Bauman, and the MGU 
[physicotechnical and Bauman educational institutions and the 
Moscow State University], and the brain drain will cease. 
  "Back in July 1988, some persons who shared my ideas and I 
formed the `Zemlyane' Business Cooperation Association, whose 
members are associations with a nonstate form of ownership. The 
economic development of space is a priority for us. We are 
looking for promising aerospace projects for capital investment. 
Twice a year--in April and October--we hold international 
conferences in which scientists take part and we publish 
collections of materials. These are still just the first steps, 
of course. Many generations of our descendants will be faced 
with tasks that are colossal in scope. But this is an objective, 
tangible strategic purpose, clear and attractive to each and 
every person, not some kind of mythical communism and sausage 
for everyone. Although you will see the people rallying together 
in the right way on the way into space, loving each other, and 
providing themselves with their daily bread in a friendly 
manner." 
  [Khalin] You speak about private capital investment in space 
programs, Viktor Vladimirovich. But what about state and other 
forms of ownership? Is there really no place for them under the 
sun? 
  [Shchekochikhin] Of course, why not? But they are very 
sluggish. The past 70 years of our history have clearly 
demonstrated that you will not overtake civilization by the 
roadside. There is no reason to invent the bicycle. I am 
convinced that the future lies with private ownership. What is 
good about 30 members of a cooperative, for example, arguing 
until they are hoarse and laboring in vain to determine the best 
way for them to enter the market? But a competent decision will 
have to be made in a short amount of time concerning the 
investment or transfer of capital, let us say. So it turns out 
that the private entrepreneur is always ahead, and pays his 
employees--and pays them well!--for a business gain instead of a 
dispute about words. I was trained as an accountant and I worked 
as an auditor in different sectors. I often traveled throughout 
the former Soviet Union and realized long ago that only personal 
interest within a legal framework is capable of moving the 
economy, science, and culture ahead on progressive paths. My 
path in business began when I opened one of Moscow's first 
consultation bureaus in the field of economic law and finance. 
Two weeks after the law on cooperatives was approved I 
registered a cooperative--actually with the functions of a bank, 
which began providing insurance, clearing and credit, and 
financial services. I opened training classes for accountants 
and cooperative chairmen. When I began accumulating capital, I 
saw for myself that it is impossible to realize economic plans 
outside of the market infrastructure, without reliable partners, 
a strong legal foundation, and a calm if not respectful attitude 
toward free enterprise and private property in the mass 
consciousness. I do not intend to take capital abroad; on the 
contrary, I am actively trying to create an environment as 
favorable as possible for free enterprise, for foreign 
investments in domestic programs, and for the enlightenment of 
minds. I am attending the Diplomatic Academy myself, gnawing on 
the granite of post-Marxist science about the society we were 
guarded against for decades, and it has moved farther and 
farther ahead. Now this is what I have come up with. I think I 
have been on the right path. The letters also convince me of 
this. Once I received a letter from 15-year-olds in the Far 
East: teach us the right way to make money competently, they 
said, so that we can become rich people and compete with the 
Americans. I received a similar request from mature persons in 
Western Ukraine who wondered why they spent the best years of 
their lives working hard on the century's construction projects. 
They think they have enough strength to scrape together some 
capital over the next 10 years or so and pass it on to their 
grandchildren to give them starting opportunities. 
  Do you sense the mood? People are fed up with living in a 
country without rich people. And I agree with them. I want to 
see Russia without poor people. I am sometimnes called a private 
property fanatic. This is not the case at all. State 
enterprises, sovkhozes, or kolkhozes do not have to be broken 
up. Under conditions of market relationships, private capital 
should simply occupy its proper place in the economy. But for a 
start, taking into account our traditions of leveling and 
parasitism, it must be provided for, including through 
legislation, by giving priority to opportunities for its 
buildup. Only then will there be a truly competitive 
environment--the ferment of a country's progressive development. 
Only then will there be genuine democracy. The owner (it does 
not matter what he owns--capital, a creative gift, or a 
profession) is economically free. He will never be suited by a 
ration, unlike those whose payment depends entirely on the 
arbitrariness of the state and its officials. An energetic 
person will always find an energetic employer. And they will not 
be serving an abstract state interest, but shaping a state which 
is capable of looking out for the interests of its 
citizen-owners. In my view, this is what democracy is all about. 
  [Khalin] As I understand it, you are building a bridge from 
the national idea of space development to the creation of a 
state with a market economy and prosperous owners. How can this 
be achieved and in what period of time, in your view? 
  [Shchekochikhin] Not in 30 or 40 years, as the skeptics are 
promising, but much sooner. In order to consolidate market 
relationships we need two things--private ownership and a 
competitive environment. There is only one way to achieve 
this--through parliament. As owners, we want and should be 
represented in a legislative organ. We are prepared to join a 
bloc with parties which really stand up for the rights of 
entrepreneurs and common human values. I think we will find 
understanding both in the State Duma and among the people, and 
together we will work out and adopt a normative foundation for a 
legal democratic state. The people are tired of the shocks and 
the futile political brawling, and they yearn for clarity and 
stability. I am convinced that the healthy, productive forces of 
our society are capable of offering a clear-cut program to get 
out of the crisis and awaken Russians' creative spirit. We were 
not born yesterday! If other states have been able to raise 
themselves from the ruins to the heights of prosperity, God 
himself has told us to dare. Our resources--both natural and 
human resources--are inexhaustible. We need only to get 
organized, unfetter initiative, and move from populist games to 
actual reform of the economy. 
  [Khalin] But what do you mean by "a clear-cut program?" 
  [Shchekochikhin] First of all, we need a package of laws on 
private property: it is sacred and inviolable. Only then will it 
be possible to stop official arbitrariness and all kinds of 
social experiments--first given, then taken away, either 
forgotten or lost. Separately, laws on the priority of domestic 
private enterprise and the right to own, buy and sell land... 
  [Khalin] Excuse me, but the mass media from government 
circles are advertising the successes of privatization. At the 
end of last year, the president's edict "On Regulating Land 
Relationships and the Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia" 
was published. Isn't this really a solution of the problem? 
  [Shchekochikhin] I will answer the question with another 
question. Simply put, for ordinary people to understand. Vanya 
is lying on a sofa with a share of stock in his pocket. He has 
not tasted the competitive struggle, and he has not burned his 
fingers in bankruptcy. He will be receiving dividends without 
risking anything except his voucher. Well, what kind of owner is 
he? As before, he is relying on the collective reasoning of some 
other person. And that person is a member of the 
nomenklatura--he has not raised a finger, either. Both of them 
seem to be relying on each other, but both of them would not 
object to cheating each other. Vanya has been working 
listlessly, and he is counting on this in the future as well; 
the bureaucrat could not care less--as before, he is closer to 
the feeding trough. It does not smell of reform here, either. 
There is still no owner of capital, no person with work 
skills--no competition, no ownership, and hence, no market. 
  As far as the land edict is concerned, it does not have 
direct action; it only declares private ownership of land and 
contains references to the legislation in force, which does not 
reflect the questions of buying and selling. In the meantime, 
land is not being put into private ownership, but leased or 
inherited for use during one's lifetime. It may be terminated 
not with the death of an owner, but much sooner: under the new 
edict the land becomes the object of auction bidding. The farmer 
who has invested millions of rubles and years of work in his 
plot risks being deprived of it right away. It may be taken away 
by the heads of administrations under the pretext that it has 
been utilized poorly. That is, a wide sluice has been opened for 
official arbitrariness. 
  This is a deeply personal question for me: I invested a 
great 
deal of money in land. I have several thousand hectares in the 
suburban Moscow area and near Ryazan. Last fall I harvested a 
good barley crop. With what I received from its sale I bought 
two tractors and two combines, thereby providing new equipment 
for future agricultural operations. I recently acquired deserted 
farms on a sovkhoz--I will be raising bulls. There is an 
arrangement with a Spanish firm to form an SP [joint venture] to 
process livestock products. 
  [Khalin] Do you consider yourself a rich man? 
  [Shchekochikhin] There are different kinds of wealth. I want 
to enjoy all the advantages of land, of course. But for me this 
is not an end in itself. I do not store up money in a box or go 
on a spree. I am fascinated by the process of enterprise itself, 
and I want my money to work for me. Those who formerly were 
engaged in illegal economic activity, those who grabbed state 
property in the course of privatization, and those who receive 
superprofits without any preparation boast about their wealth. 
These people have not smelled the market or earned every kopeck 
through bitter experience. They obtained their wealth easily and 
they lose it easily--on binges, possessions, and in the casino. 
They corrupt society and their environment, mistreat less 
fortunate citizens, and disparage the importance of true 
entrepreneurs, who are increasing capital not for the sake of 
luxury, but by vocation as production organizers and those who 
create what is new and advanced. There have been forerunners of 
the latter in Russian history--Tretyakov, Mamontov, Morozov, and 
Sytin. 
  Generally speaking, I distinguish between three varieties in 
enterprise: the nomenklatura variety, that is, the enterprise 
that is "seized for privatization," the state enterprise, 
personified by the corps of directors; and finally, our private 
enterprise, when a person has struggled through all the 
obstacles with his own brain and has achieved his status by hard 
work. To us, the first two groups exist as partners which have 
to be forced out in the course of the competitive struggle. 
There are few of us at present. As an example, the "Goryachev" 
Concern in St. Petersburg, which manufactures and repairs 
pianos. At Ramenskoye, in the suburbs of Moscow, the builder 
Guskov is well-known... In a word, there are about 5,000 legal 
entities in our union. In general, the entrepreneurial class in 
every nation under market conditions makes up no more than 3 to 
5 percent of the population. We are far removed from this 
indicator, of course. But there is a time for everyone. And we 
will reach our heights, too. 
  [Khalin] Well, all right, one way or another, but you are 
wealthy and I am not. How does this correlate with your thesis 
on a Russia without poor people? 
  [Shchekochikhin] The number of poor will be reduced in 
proportion to the increase in the number of wealthy persons. 
Well-to-do persons will need hundreds and thousands of skilled 
workers, engineers, lawyers, and so forth, including artists and 
journalists. Each one of them salaried in accordance with his 
services. If you do not want to stand in need, demonstrate the 
quality of your work. After all, everything is competitive here 
as well. Perhaps to a certain extent it is accidental or good 
luck. But this is life. This is what the West is based on. And 
it does not seem to be especially poor. As far as the sick and 
the aged are concerned, the state will take care of them if we 
are meticulous about paying our taxes. And every state is rich 
with the wealth of its citizens. The more wealthy people there 
are, the wealthier the budget. Charity cannot be disregarded, 
either. 
  [Khalin] So we are standing at the gates of paradise? 
  [Shchekochikhin] Paradise will never come if we wait 
passively for manna from Heaven. If you want to live, know how 
to spin around. This probably sounds a little crude, but it is 
100-percent true about everything. We ourselves are the only 
ones who will protect our interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Lapik: "Cry for Gaydar"] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister was clearly unlucky with 
his last name. Indeed, what can be expected of a government 
headed by a person by the name of Chernomyrdin? That is not even 
funny. That is mockery.... 
<H5>  Make It Through the Day and Hold Out Through the Night </H5>
  From the very beginning nobody believed in the reforms. 
Yeltsin was a populist but not a reformer. It is one thing to 
drive out the communists, to destroy the previous system, to 
promise everything and anything, but it was something altogether 
different to build something new in a country. A new economy, 
new property relations, a new order. It is one thing to speak 
about a transition to the market, at the mention of which the 
hungry voter begins to salivate: 50 kinds of sausage, a lot of 
meat and vodka. And quite another--to make the transition to 
this same market--through increasing prices, property 
stratification, and unemployment. 
  And here Gaydar appeared. Where he came from and why Yeltsin 
trusted him--nobody knows for sure. 
  Possibly the president read one of his articles. But the 
post 
of prime minister could have been taken over with the same 
success by Vasiliy Selyunin, Nikolay Shmelev, or Larisa 
Piyasheva... 
  As early as a week before Gaydar's appointment leading 
observers were asserting: Yeltsin is not capable of any 
transformations in the economy. He simply does not understand 
what needs to be done. And if it is explained to him he will 
never decide to do it. 
  The same opinion was held by Yavlinskiy and Fedorov, who had 
already worked in the Silayev government. Everything will go as 
it goes. It will collapse and be plundered. Rot and decompose. 
Until everything gets as bad as it can be. Until Russia ends up 
on the brink of complete collapse, until it sinks amidst bloody 
rebellions, hunger, and poverty. 
  The first to shut down will be the railroads. The cities 
will 
be deprived of light and heat. The peasants will hide grain from 
the state and the workers' food detachments will be met with 
axes. 
  The army will become insubordinate and try to seize power. 
But it will be almost impossible to keep it. Hunger is stronger 
than fear. 
  State institutions will collapse before our eyes. Everyone 
will begin to try to save himself as best he can. Banditry, 
crime, epidemics. War by everyone against everyone else. 
Demarcation of territories, borders with machine gun bursts 
along the roads, local money used for toilet paper.... 
  Actually, everything was proceeding toward this. Every 
little 
town near Moscow was printing its own paper money--coupons for 
sugar, tea, tobacco and vodka, for eggs and cereal, macaroni and 
flour. In Moscow some things could be bought freely, but 50 
kilometers to the south or north--there was almost nothing. They 
would get in line to wait for milk at 0500 in the morning. 
Cheese, meat, and sausage were not seen for months. Bread could 
be bought only after waiting in line for hours. Canned goods 
required a certificate. It seemed that there would never be an 
end to it. But now three years have passed and who remembers it? 
Nobody. 
  Now everyone puts on an intelligent air and discusses the 
idea that the reform could have been conducted with lesser 
costs: It was not necessary to rob the people, to destroy the 
enterprises. That Gaydar's methods turned out to be flawed and 
destructive. That "the whole country is shaken from these 
experiments." And now everything will have to be done over 
again, corrected, restored. 
  Others, conversely, reproach Gaydar for being too soft and 
inconsistent. It was necessary to bring what was started to 
completion: to decontrol all prices, to completely 
refrain from subsidies, to destroy inefficient productions. 
  And each is right in his own way. But reflections about the 
idea that what Gaydar did was not what he should have done and 
what he should not have done emerge from the present-day reality 
for some reason. And this is unfair, to say the least. Gaydar 
did what he could do at the time. And we still do not know in 
what kind of country and under what kind of authority we would 
be living today if he had not managed to convince Yeltsin that 
it was impossible to keep controls on consumer prices any longer 
and, consequently, they had to be decontrolled. 
  True, we do not know what would have happened otherwise: 
What 
kinds of plans the government would have come up with today and 
who would be in charge there if only Gaydar had managed to 
persuade Yeltsin. What, for example, would have happened to 
industry and agriculture if oil and coal prices had been 
decontrolled all at once, during the first months of the 
reforms, and not gradually? Collapse. Paralysis of the economy 
and the social sphere. Hyperinflation which could not have been 
stopped.... 
  In a word, not everything is as simple as it seems: Gaydar's 
reforms are market reforms, which are useful and correct, and 
everything that is not included in these reforms is bad. 
  In general I do not believe that the country's economy has 
been managed by anyone at all in recent years. All this time we 
were being carried along on the waves; there simply was no 
independent course and there could not be one. Ryzhkov, Pavlov, 
Gaydar, and Chernomyrdin--all of them were just hanging on to 
the helm and at best were checking to make sure that the ship 
did not dive into the water and sink. Gaydar had to cut down a 
couple of masts and throw superfluous items overboard. At least 
he kept the ship afloat. That was his assignment. And that was 
good. 
  Now, of course, we can regret the things that we lost or, 
groaning, we can throw up some boards to take the place of the 
masts. But this will not change the essence of things. 
  Whether it is with Gaydar or with Chernomyrdin, we are still 
tossing about without a rudder until the winds bring us up to 
some shore. 
  Of course this does not mean that we must grow weak and not 
try to do anything. We must strengthen discipline, pump out the 
water, swab the deck, or sharpen the anchor with a file--as long 
as we do something. Otherwise, the inactivity will cause the 
team to start to drink, to be depressed, and to hang the captain 
and his assistants from the mast. Incidentally, this is already 
psychology. But what is the difference? 
<H5>  There Will Be No Anesthesia! </H5>
  When Gaydar left the first time it was indeed perceived as a 
tragedy. Leaving along with him were the hopes that life in this 
country could change for the better at all. 
  For the first time people had been given at least some sign 
of hope: Goods appeared, the waiting lines disappeared. That 
alone could serve as a confirmation of the correctness of the 
course that had been chosen. And if Gaydar had been allowed to 
finish what he had started.... 
  And in fact what could have happened if Gaydar had not been 
interfered with? 
  Yegor Timurovich asserts that with a strict financial 
policy, 
inflation could have been curbed fairly quickly. 
  Against a background of financial stabilization, investments 
in production would have been advantageous. There would have 
been billions' worth of capital investments in the most 
promising branches of the economy. Real money, dollars. As a 
result--a construction boom, technical retooling of enterprises, 
the introduction of new technologies, development of the 
infrastructure.... 
  It is another matter that it would have been necessary to 
pay 
a considerable price for all this. The only ones that would have 
been likely to stay afloat would have been the extraction 
branches, enterprises involved with initial processing of raw 
material, an insignificant proportion of the defense plants, and 
the agrarian sector, without which you cannot get anywhere in 
any case. 
  And 20-30 million unemployed would have become a reality. 
These people would have been discharged all at once, within a 
half year. Even today, according to calculations of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, the proportion of enterprises operating at 
a loss is 35 percent. If prices of energy sources were to be 
raised just a little more, according to all canons, 60 percent 
of the Russian enterprises would go bankrupt. 
  But these, as it were, are pure calculations--in terms of 
profitability and production outlays. But in fact not only the 
weak ones but also the ones they would grab hold of would sink. 
It is sufficient for one bank to be destroyed in order for 
hundreds of its clients to be left without money. It is 
sufficient for one monopoly enterprise to go bankrupt for all 
the recipients of its products to be on the verge of collapse. 
  But the ones that survived would be in perfectly good shape. 
And, possibly, their profit would be quite enough to feed the 
unemployed and to import a sufficient quantity of goods and food 
products. 
  In time, and fairly soon, the first green shoots would begin 
to appear on the scorched fields of reforms. Opening up in the 
premises of the former shops and factories would be new private 
enterprises which would produce products completely in line with 
the world level--under licenses, using imported equipment and 
technologies. In principle it is not so difficult to make vacuum 
cleaners, refrigerators, and washing machines. And who these 
enterprises would belong to--our capital or foreign 
capital--does that make any difference? 
  The patriotism would lie in the fact that the economy was 
finally working. So that foreign goods would gradually be 
crowded out of the domestic market. So that domestic products 
would be just as good and inexpensive. So that they would 
penetrate into foreign markets and increase the influx of 
currency and technologies to us. 
  A few small things, as they say, would be lacking: To live 
through the first two years of mass unemployment, to quell the 
dissatisfaction of millions of people who had been thrown out 
into the streets, and not to allow theft, violence, and 
rebellion. To create new jobs, organize social work, to pay 
people for merely sitting quietly at home.... 
  Are the government and president ready for this? Is our 
entire system of social protection capable today of finding 
jobs, retraining, or even supporting all 3 million people with 
stipends. With full mobilization--5-6 million. What about the 
rest?... 
<H5>  Hypnotists and Horses </H5>
  What is remarkable about Gaydar? He hypnotizes us with the 
simplicity of his solutions. There is no need to invent anything 
new. It is a typical three-move problem: Compress the money 
supply--stabilize finances--attract investments. And that is it. 
You can calculate the profit. It is very modern: Without doing 
anything you can put together the capital. Today 10,000, 
tomorrow--a million, day after tomorrow--a billion. It is not 
important how. The main thing is the result. 
  Why waste your time on concrete producers? Let them solve 
their own problems. Why regulate investments? Money knows where 
to flow. There is no need to exercise the muscles of the state; 
on the contrary, it must relax its grip--and the fear of ruin 
combined with prospects for getting rich quick will do 
everything for us. 
  We have tried it--it does not work. Fear, of course, is an 
excellent motivater, but what if, for example, a person does not 
become frightened the way he is supposed to, or he will not run 
faster than a horse in any case--he cannot. The same thing with 
enterprises: Whether you frighten them or not, using the 
equipment they have and the technologies with which they are 
armed, not to mention the qualifications of the workers, you 
will not get far. 
  Things have not worked out with material incentives either. 
If the administration had officially had a share of the profits 
of its plants and factories, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, perhaps it 
would have managed these enterprises differently. But as it 
is--what difference does technical progress make? You quickly 
democratize and jump ahead--and you sit there and wait for 
subsidies. 
  For the first year and a half Gaydar struggled with the 
consumers. With all its might the government stifled pensioners, 
doctors, and teachers, and allotted no money for science and 
art. It simply gave the enterprises no cash to pay wages. They 
thought they had to restrict consumer demand. Then the prices 
would stop rising as well. 
  Nothing of the kind. State enterprises could not care less 
about consumer demand. There were mutual nonpayments, working 
for the warehouse. Instead of lowering prices, they began to 
curtail production. 
  Then they decided to approach from the other direction: To 
drive domestic prices up to the level of world prices and let 
foreigners have domestic monopolies. Anyone who could not 
withstand the competition with foreign goods would perish. He 
would be shown the door. And what difference did it make to the 
consumer what he had: Russian cheese or Dutch cheese? The Dutch 
cheese is even tastier. 
  For an entire year they were moving toward finally 
decontrolling prices. By last autumn they discovered that 
domestic prices might very well exceed world prices--and 
nothing! The economy was operating just as inefficiently as it 
was before. Domestic producers, instead of reducing production 
costs and improving the quality of their products, demanded one 
thing: protection from foreign goods, high customs duties, and 
protectionism. 
  Theory is one thing, and how it is manifested is another. 
Try 
not paying wages to miners. Or put the automotive giants to 
rest. In the former case they were unable to hold down consumer 
demand, and in the latter they could not hold up under the 
pressure from the producers. Gaydar failed in the social sphere 
and the nonpayments crisis. Chernomyrdin raised customs duties. 
How is the one better than the other? Gaydar's return to the 
government last year was marked by nothing at all except a 
scandal over the elections. He did not even try to do anything 
in the post of first deputy prime minister. And they would not 
have allowed him to do anything radical. All that time he was 
something like a table decoration--some kind of stuffed pig 
which nobody could eat, but they would stick a fork into him 
from time to time out of ignorance. 
  Understandably, in order to conduct reforms or, rather, to 
destroy domestic industry, Gaydar at least had to become a 
majority leader in the State Duma and hold a position of deputy 
prime minister. Then he could have looked to the president less 
and conducted an independent policy. But apparently, he went 
against logic here: A dentist who, without anesthesia, pulls the 
teeth of everyone who ends up in his chair cannot hope for his 
patients to love him. To them he is primarily a sadist, a 
torturer. And although things will get better--they still had to 
pay for this with their teeth. They cannot grow new ones. 
  And there is always a suspicion that there was no need to 
pull them out at all, that it was possible to fix them.... 
<H5>  The Magic of the Circle </H5>
  Chernomyrdin, as distinct from Gaydar, was convinced that it 
was still possible to change things. Here is his logic: Let us 
earmark the priority branches--the ones without which we cannot 
live--transportation, energy engineering, communications, the 
agro-industrial complex. We must help to support them. Not give 
them money thoughtlessly, but for concrete projects. For 
instance, we could buy imported equipment for the food industry. 
Everyone knows that one-third of the agricultural products are 
lost during processing and storage.... 
  There are enterprises that need only the first impetus, to 
be 
put back in shape--and they will make their way to world 
markets. Many need no help at all. Simply leave them alone and 
do not oppress them with taxes. Do the petroleum and gas workers 
not know how to increase their output? 
  It is necessary to increase the controllability of the 
national economy. If an enterprise is financed by the treasury 
it must be answerable to the state. Price restrictions. In a 
year it was clear that if you raise transportation rates and the 
cost of electric energy, all the other prices will increase 
immediately. In a couple of months the energy engineers and 
railroad workers will begin to operate at a loss again. The 
situation reproduces itself. Only with each new spiral, more 
enterprises become unprofitable. 
  We must sit down and reach an agreement: We will not raise 
rates any more, it is better to let a couple of branches exist 
on subsidies than all industry and agriculture. But you too, 
gentlemen users, keep your prices within reasonable bounds, do 
not crank up profitability, do not try to live well at someone 
else's expense. The treasury is not made of rubber. If we get 
rid of the subsidies it will be the worse for you.... 
  But what do you say to this? Logic! But in reality? 
  Were the state enterprises not previously controlled by the 
ministries and departments? The plan for the year, the quarter, 
quotas, funds, statistical reporting--this will be harder than 
the contract system to which Chernomyrdin wants to switch the 
directors. What fool would live on wages now if he had untold 
resources at hand? 
  And investments from the state pocketbook? So far the return 
from 1 ruble invested has not exceeded 8 kopeks in the state 
sector. Let us say that their conscience awakens--15 kopeks will 
be returned from the ruble. For a million in 
expenditures--150,000 in profit. Not very effective! No budget 
in the world could take this. 
  And in general it is ridiculous to speak about "nonmonetary" 
methods of fighting inflation. The agreement is worth more than 
money where there is control and failure to keep one's words can 
cost not simply money, but all the money. And it is 
out of the pocket of the ones who make the agreement. 
  Monetary methods, incidentally, are not worth much either. 
For the first half year or year they worked: Inflation depended 
almost entirely on the amount of money in circulation. If we 
constrict the money supply, do not pay for grain purchases, and 
do not give wages to the miners--prices grow more slowly. Once 
financing is opened up, there is a burst of inflation. But 
today, whether you constrict money supply or not, prices will 
grow anyway. Specialists say that inflation has manifested its 
character. Nonmonetary. 
  Neither Gaydar nor Fedorov would achieve anything with his 
devices today. They did as much as they could in the autumn--to 
curb inflation for one month, until the elections. And they did 
it shabbily: They simply did not pay money to the people to whom 
it was promised. And then they left, shutting the door in such a 
way that the dollar collapsed on Chernomyrdin. Let the winner 
pay. 
<H5>  The Heavy Hand of Invisible Reforms </H5>
  I do not know, it seems to me that all these 
reforms--Gaydar's, Chernomyrdin's--are useless busy work, 
something to distract the people. Gaydar drove the money supply 
here and there, Chernomyrdin intends to do selection work on the 
enterprises. It is all the same--nothing will come of it. 
  As long as it stands as a monolith, the state 
economy--monopolized, militarized, dull-witted, scarfing up 
resources--you will not be able to do anything with it. 
  Gaydar wanted to break it--they would not let him. And he 
could not have: The first to be ruined would be the government, 
along with the president and the minister of internal affairs. 
Chernomyrdin wants to cure it. But such a thing cannot be cured. 
No matter how many trillions you throw into our agriculture--we 
still will not receive a good crop. No matter how many benefits 
you give the Volga Automotive Plant--the Toyota will still be 
better than the Zhiguli. 
  Nothing will happen in this country as long as we rob the 
state and tear it apart. As long as bureaucrats, bandits, and 
businessmen divide it up among themselves. When all this stops, 
everything will suddenly calm down. 
  As soon as chaos and the lawlessness cease to bring us 
maximum profit--a strong power, a new order, and a government 
with the people's trust will appear. 
  These invisible reforms have been going on for a long time 
and soon will come to an end--according to all the signs there 
may be five or six years left, no more. Then we will achieve 
financial stability and vigorous economic growth. But until 
then--expect nothing. We have had no other reforms, and we could 
not have had them. Neither under Gorbachev and Pavlov nor under 
Yeltsin and Gaydar. But there is also another viewpoint. Larisa 
Piyasheva, for example, states that immediately after the August 
putsch--two and a half years ago--it would have been possible to 
conduct any ultraradical reforms. The people would have lived 
through price increases and unemployment--if only to rid 
themselves once and for all of the previous hated power, an 
existence of semistarvation, and the unremitting hopelessness of 
socialist realism. 
  The more so since in exchange people could gain economic 
freedom, ownership of the means of production, and the land. 
  The breakdown of state monopolies; rapid, landslide 
privatization; the land reform; decontrolling of prices; 
reduction of taxes and halting of budget financing--this is what 
was required of the authorities after the overthrow of the 
communist regime. 
  But Yeltsin went only so far as to liberalize prices. This 
is 
actually where all the reforms ended. Gaydar became obsessed 
with financial stabilization, perhaps letting go by his only 
chance to carry out more radical transformations in the economy. 
He limited himself to half measures, essentially changed 
nothing, and as a result he was defeated. 
  But it is not even a matter of Gaydar himself. The problem 
is 
that over two years the social base for the reforms melted away. 
Society was split. The president has no unconditional support 
from the population. The people are disenchanted with the idea 
that the results of the reform can never meet their expectations. 
  We no longer have a liberal option. There will be neither a 
peaceful democratic breakthrough to the market nor even a 
Chilean dictatorship. 
  Of three possible paths of development, Russia has only two 
left, writes Larisa Piyasheva in an article entitled "There Will 
Be No More Russian Miracle." Either the sluggish Yeltsin 
dictatorship, step by step abandoning all its democratic 
positions and being transformed before our eyes into Brezhnevian 
timelessness. Or an out-and-out communist-fascist dictatorship, 
at the end of which we can expect complete collapse of all our 
hopes and illusions, more isolation from the world.... 
  And in my opinion, all these changes of governments, 
programs, and presidents, all these elections and putsches will 
not change anything in principle. Global reform will go the way 
it has been going. At best the advantage will be gained by 
various groups of privatizers. Gaydar played into the hands of 
foreign capital. Chernomyrdin--to the benefit of the directors 
of state enterprises and big-time bureaucrats. If Zhirinovskiy 
comes to power--he will help the bandits or someone else. 
  Relax, this has almost nothing to do with us. Work on 
yourself.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Delyagin, director of the applied </F>
analysis service under the Institute of the Economic Problems of 
the Transition Period: "The Share of the `Shadow Economy' has 
Doubled in the Past Year"] 
  [Text] Mikhail Delyagin, director of the applied 
analysis service under the Institute of the Economic Problems of 
the Transition Period, analyzes one of the reasons for the 
unfavorable changes in the structure of the money supply. 
  During practically all of 1993 the rate of the growth of 
cash 
substantially exceeded the rate of growth of the money supply as 
a whole. According to data from the Central Bank of Russia, the 
amount of cash in circulation (the monetary aggregate MO) 
increased 7.9 times (from 1.7 to 13.3 trillion rubles) during 
the past year whereas the money supply as a whole (the aggregate 
M2) grew only 5.1 times (from R7.1 to R36.7 trillion). 
  The indicated inequality in growth rates has led to a 
substantial increase in the share of cash in the money supply 
(see graphic)--from 23.5 percent as of 1 January 1993 to 36.2 
percent as of 1 January 1994. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-035-27A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  "All other things being equal," the growth of the share of 
cash is evidence by itself of an increase in the shortage of 
money and of the increasing severity of financial policy, since 
cash, which primarily services the needs of the population, is 
the most difficult to contract and the least elastic aggregate 
of the money supply. 
  Moreover, the growth of the share of cash in the money 
supply 
almost always means its involvement in the servicing of 
production turnover. This takes place, as a rule, again in 
periods of increasing severity of financial policy as a result 
of the squeezing out of working capital from non-cash turnover 
into cash turnover. 
  The growth of the share of cash in the money supply also is 
evidence of the reduction of the possibility of the state to 
influence actually occuring economic processes. The increasing 
severity of the state's financial policy thus leads to the 
accelerated liberalization of the economy from under state 
control (in the absolute majority of cases being replaced, as we 
can see, by criminal control). 
  The following comparison is important for evaluating the 
scale of the degree of involvement of cash in the servicing of 
production turnover: the Central Bank claims that R13.3 trillion 
in cash was in circulation in the territory of Russia as of 1 
January 1994. Practically simultaneously with this the State 
Committee for Statistics reports that only a total of R7.8 
trillion (not counting the money in commercial organizations) 
was in the hands of the population on the indicated date. 
  The difference--R5.5 trillion (41 percent of all 
cash)--represents the working capital of juridical bodies and 
constitutes almost two-thirds of the funds in the current 
accounts of enterprises and organizations (R8.5 trillion as of 1 
January 1994). We can be certain that only an insignificant 
portion of this money is being legally used as working 
capital--if only because nobody has abolished the enforceable 
enactments published in the 1992 "cash crisis" period and 
significantly restricting the legal use of cash as working 
capital. 
  Today's economic practice is evidence of the fact that the 
use of cash as working capital practically eliminates state 
control over the operations being carried out. Taking this into 
account the data derived indicate that 39.3 percent of the 
entire turnover of the economy of Russia is in essence not under 
the control of the state. One can easily disregard the 
uncertainty arising due to the presence of funds intended for 
wages in the cashier's offices of enterprises in the first place 
because, as of 1 January, all that one can pay the workers, as a 
rule, already has been paid and, secondly, because the magnitude 
cited can be considered only as the lower limit of the share of 
the turnover not under the control of the state. These are two 
reasons for this. 
  The calculations derived take into account only the ruble 
component of working capital whereas a significant portion of 
many of the most dynamically developing markets, for example 
motor vehicles and housing, are being serviced only by foreign 
currency. 
  The most efficient directions of economic activity, where 
money turns over more rapidly and, consequently, succeeds in 
servicing a greater volume of operations than on the average for 
the national economy, are escaping from under the control of the 
state first of all. 
  The fact that as of 1 January 1993 the lower limit of the 
sector of the economy not under the control of the state, 
calculated on the basis of an analogous method, was at the level 
of 20 percent of the turnover merits attention. Consequently, 
the relative share and, correspondingly, the significance of the 
"shadow" Russian economy has at least doubled during the past 
year.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chernyshev, economic observer: "The </F>
Gold Reserve of `Finist' Bank"] 
  [Text] 
  In the Moscow bank rating, Finist Bank is in the group of 
extremely successful leaders, holding a stable position among 
them. Today this is a strategically advantageous position in the 
marathon distance of the Russian movement toward the market. It 
is possible to spring ahead, but then you run the risk of 
overtaxing your forces. And they are needed to confidently reach 
the goals that have been set. But the impressive rates of 
development of Finist Bank and its rapid and confident mastery 
of new kinds of services and modern banking technologies reveal 
in it the fighting spirit of one of the most powerful and 
promising financial institutions in the country. While in 1992 
its currency reserve increased 2.8-fold, credit 
investments--2.5-fold, and profit--fivefold, during the past 
year these indicators stood out even more sharply--4.5-fold, 
fourfold, and 4.4-fold, respectively. Of course the growth of 
volumes and the scale of banking operations were taken into 
account here. 
  The person I spoke with, Mikhail Gladilin, a member of the 
board of Finist Bank, nonetheless evaluates the results of the 
path that has been followed critically and in a balanced 
fashion. His taciturn reflections are distinguished by their 
simplicity, logic, and completely convincing arguments. I did 
not observe a desire to promote himself, to present himself in a 
more advantageous light. "We are a team that adheres to the 
ideology of mutual prosperity," he emphasized repeatedly in the 
conversation. "That is, we can all get rich together, but not at 
one another's expense. Through mutual efforts we are striving to 
increase our combined revenues. This approach corresponds more 
to the Russian national character than the principle of Western 
individualism does." 
  Finist Bank, as one of the largest and most competitive 
general commercial banks of Russia, which performs to high 
international standards, was created in 1989 and soon obtained a 
license from the Central Bank of Russia. It is a matter of 
special pride that it has no cases of failure to fulfill its 
payment obligations. Under difficult economic conditions of 
rupture of economic ties, nonpayments, decline of production, 
inflation, and other kinds of disorder the bank has managed to 
protect the interests of its clients and stockholders. All of 
its stocks, incidentally, have gone through the procedure of 
licensing, that is, verification for quality and reliability, 
they have a permanent market quotation, and they are highly 
liquid securities. All this attracts extremely solid and 
respectable companions. 
  It would take too much time to travel to all the places 
where 
the bank does business--its 19 branches are located in large 
industrial centers of Russia and CIS countries and serve more 
than 6,000 dynamically developing enterprises and organizations. 
Finist Bank has correspondent relations with first-class banks 
of the United States, Germany, England, France, Singapore, and 
other countries. 
  "Our bank's gold reserve includes dozens of devoted, honest, 
and highly professional specialists," Mikhail Gladilin says with 
conviction. "This year we will be placing most of our hopes in 
them. The bank has created a computer center and a significant 
analytical service that has diverse independent sources of 
information. We are investing a great deal of effort and money 
in the growth of our intellectual potential and technical 
retooling, while receiving a high return from this. In 
particular, Finist Bank plans to change over to a system of 
electronic payments, `without leaving the office,' within a 
realistic time frame and also to introduce a system of accounts 
using plastic credit cards. 
  "Today our banking organism is in a stage of stable and 
confident growth," continues Mikhail Gladilin. "While our 
previous achievements were gained relatively simply, our current 
prognosis and analysis convince us of the need to turn toward 
strategic target planning, to tested expedient and economical 
actions, and to a radical improvement of the quality of work and 
of personnel and bank subdivisions with existing and new service 
markets. The search for solutions is proceeding in a market 
spirit--healthy, vital, and creative. Strategic target planning, 
for example, strives to `look' several years ahead, is built on 
a comprehensive analysis of global changes in economic 
conditions, and is calculated for specific spheres of activity 
and talented Russian entrepreneurs, as well as the capabilities 
of the partners and clients of our bank. 
  "Here is one example of `quick reaction' to what would seem 
to be insignificant changes in the economic situation. There was 
revealed a tendency for Russia to begin to raise higher and 
higher the customs barriers that protect domestic commodity 
producers from the flow of goods and finished products that has 
surged onto our immense market. So in a year or two it will be 
more advantageous not to import foreign goods but to produce our 
own products in Russia itself on the basis of existing 
enterprises. But the latter have a significant `but.' In order 
to produce competitive products, practically all Russian 
productions are in need of modernization, reconstruction, new 
mechanisms for financial and administrative activity, and 
retraining of personnel. Otherwise, we will never see high-class 
furniture, motor vehicles, audiovisual equipment, computers, or 
many other things with the long-awaited mark `made in Russia.' 
  "In order to carry out these tasks the bank has founded the 
International Investment Fund (MFI) which will soon open in 
Moscow. It will work on establishing direct ties between Russian 
and Western partners, developing technical-economic plans and 
investment programs, and preparing all the necessary 
documentation. In this connection I was happy to learn of the 
two-volume `Guide to German Enterprises' which gives `portraits' 
of 400 of the most successful German firms that want to work 
with their Russian partners. 
  "The publication was prepared and published with the 
participation of Finist Bank in the Russian and German languages 
by the Russian firm Poliform in conjunction with its Berlin 
partner Katalist Verlagsgesellschaft GmbH. Because of the new 
information technologies it will be necessary to `work through' 
other countries as well. So it is enough for our businessmen to 
fall within the field of vision of the aforementioned MFI, 
without running through the Moscow offices and dealing with the 
bureaucracy, to engage in the creation of joint productions and 
the output of high-quality products on the basis of their own 
plants and factories. 
  "Today Finist Bank is aiming at investing its money in the 
domestic economy. Under the conditions of the unfavorable 
Russian investment complex this step, frankly, seemed 
questionable to me. After all, hundreds of today's banks are 
using their capital for transactions of the `buying and selling' 
type. By reducing its share of such operations the bank will 
inevitably lose some of its profit. It will probably be 
necessary to have supernatural sensitivity and an especially 
large reserve of strength in order to invest our money in 
productions from which the return will come in a year or two. In 
industry, agriculture, road construction, and communications. 
  "These are my assumptions here. While other businessmen are 
ranting and raving over super high profit, Finist Bank without a 
lot of fuss and with knowledge of their business holds key 
positions in the branches of the economy whose renewal will 
determine the image of the revived Russia. That is when the 
bank's strategic vision will probably appear, the emblem of 
which today is the fantastic `Finist--the bright falcon,' a 
strong, keen-sighted, high-flying bird."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Nongovernmental </F>
Report": "The Majority of Russian Citizens Have No Personal 
Savings At All. And, Apparently, They Will Have None"] 
  [Text] In the spring of 1994 the hopes and 
expectations, declarations and promises, disenchantments and 
lost illusions will be nine years old. 
  The ideologists and the ideology of reform have changed. 
There is no longer any mention of the initial objective of 
restructuring the economic mechanism--the creation of a state 
system that stimulates a desire to work, which has no 
restrictions on wages and enables people to live better and 
better. The people are remembered when there is a real threat of 
social upheaval, when the government is taking 
spur-of-the-moment measures to quell the rising antagonisms. 
That is the way it was and still is in relations with miners, 
gas extraction workers, petroleum workers, peasants, 
metallurgists, etc. As a result, two levels of socioeconomic 
perception have taken form today: 
  --first, the theorizing, governmental one which, in spite of 
and without accounting for the results of voting, sociological 
polls, and domestic social and economic prognoses, has relied on 
the questionable practice of listening to foreign advisers, 
using any means available to construct a model of a 
postsocialist society that is unfamiliar to the broad masses; 
  --second, the nationwide level, oppressed by the nightmare 
of 
the collapse of the homeland, unbridled inflation, and the 
growing squall of poverty and unemployment. 
  According to the estimate of Andres Ostlund from the 
Stockholm School of Economics, who until the middle of January 
1994 was an economic adviser to the Russian Government, 
inflation in the country during 1993 alone amounted to 850 
percent. 
  The research division of the All-Russian State Company 
(TV4R) 
during October-November 1993 conducted a mass sociological poll 
of the population of the European part of Russia with a 
representative sampling involving 1,224 people. Among others, 
the respondents were asked questions about monetary savings. As 
a result of the poll it became clear that 57.0 percent of the 
citizens have no savings, 27.0 percent have money in the Savings 
Bank, and they are mainly elderly people, and one can 
confidently assume that whatever dealings the majority of them 
have with the bank are dealings involving pension accounts. 
Commercial banks are used by 3.2 percent of those questioned and 
savings are kept in stocks and bonds by about 3.0 percent of the 
citizens. About 4.0 percent use the services of savings and 
commercial banks at the same time. Thus 84.0 percent of the 
population of Russia have no guarantee of social stability. This 
is the large proportion of the population that is actively 
joining the constantly growing stratum of the so-called 
aggressive underclass. 
  In the opinion of another former adviser to the Russian 
Government, Jeffrey Sachs from Harvard University, published by 
the newspaper THE NEW YORK TIMES, the failure of the reforms is 
explained by the West's slowness in rendering financial aid to 
Russia: "Of the 18 billion which the IMF and the World Bank were 
to have turned over to Russia, only 2 billion has been 
received." In Sachs' opinion this kind of "support" for the 
reformers will cost the West dearly. In the opinion of that same 
FINANCIAL TIMES, "By saving a kopek but losing a ruble, the 
leaders of the West have possibly made the biggest mistake since 
Versailles." 
  On the crest of the so-called Russian nationalism, new 
meaning has been given to the idea of reinforcing the NATO bloc. 
The tone of statements in the Washington administration has 
changed. An administration expert on the former USSR, Strobe 
Talbott, stated that Russian leaders should worry more about 
unemployment and street crime--whatever is bothering the simple 
people most. The administration of the IMF and World Bank assert 
that they have always recommended that the Moscow government 
develop programs capable of satisfying the "real needs" of the 
population. 
  Former USSR president M. Gorbachev in November 1993 was 
speaking in Richmond (the state of Virginia) at an international 
forum organized by FORTUNE magazine. Regarding questions of the 
crisis situation in the country and the role of the West, he 
said "The problem is that the method of conducting economic 
reforms was rejected at the level of society. 
  "The market is needed...but the negative results from it 
turned out to be greater than the positive. Production dropped 
by 40 percent as compared to 1989. In terms of living conditions 
the country was thrown back 20 years, to the beginning of the 
seventies. 
  "What happened to the Western capital? Why is Russia not 
suitable for investing capital? We have less risk for investors 
than other countries do. The October revolution will not be 
repeated and we can solve the other problems along with you. In 
terms of business prospects, our country cannot even be compared 
with any other. 
  "You have not resolved the main problem: Are you going to 
cooperate with Russia or not? There is a desire to keep Russia 
in the role of an appendage for supplying raw material to the 
West. We have received from your investors absolutely no 
proposals for reorganizing the Russian machine-building 
industry. When it comes to petroleum and other raw 
material--sure. But not machine building. 
  "Russia will never agree to play the role of a younger 
brother or a junior partner...in this respect it is closed, it 
will establish the conditions it needs and, relying on its own 
people, its own educated cadres, will prove itself. But the West 
will get a hostile armed regime." 
<H5>  What Is Happening in the Military-Industrial Complex? </H5>
  Events are developing tragically in industry, and above all 
in the military-industrial complex. According to data from the 
Russian Federation State Statistical Administration, last year 
there was a maximum reduction of output in branches that produce 
defense products--by more than 30 percent. According to data of 
the intelligence administration of the U.S. Defense Department, 
the decline of arms production in the Russian Federation 
amounted to: for attack helicopters--1990--70 and 1992--five; 
for artillery systems--1,990 and 450, respectively; for missiles 
with laser warheads--190 and 45; for fighter-bombers--575 and 
150; for combat infantry vehicles--3,600 and 1,100; for 
submarines--20 and eight; tanks--1,300 and 675; and bombers--35 
and 20. (The figures for 1990 were for the USSR and for 
1992--for Russia.) Since 1989 the volume of state allocations 
for the production of arms and military equipment has decreased 
in real terms by 78 percent, and financing for scientific 
research and experimental design work has decreased by almost as 
much. 
  In 1993 the client (the state) owed the defense industry 
about 300 billion rubles [R] and it had not paid its bills for 
1992 to many enterprises. By adopting a policy of state 
responsibility, the government is again discrediting itself, 
since it does not have a real economic basis for fulfilling the 
commitments it has made, and it even has an immense budget 
deficit. 
  As a way out of the situation that has been created it would 
be possible to adopt a simplified version of the decision--to 
reduce the number of enterprises for whose financing the state 
bears responsibility. As a result, privatization could also 
affect those enterprises that must remain state enterprises, but 
the government will apparently have to "push" them into the 
market sphere. This is why the Ministry of Finance has the last 
word in the organization of the country's defense capability. 
<H5>  Salvaging Weapons and the Capabilities of the Budget </H5>
  The deadline for storing certain kinds of weapons will 
expire 
in the near future--about 70 percent of the overall volume 
subject to being salvaged. Several thousand square kilometers of 
land have been set aside for warehouses for equipment that is 
ready for salvaging. Additionally, in keeping with international 
agreements, Russia must eliminate several classes of missiles 
and infantry weapons, which make up 30 percent of the volume. 
  A federal program has been developed for salvaging arms and 
military equipment for the period up to the year 2000. The 
program is divided into two stages. The first stage 
(1993-1995)--the development of documents, the selection of a 
strategy and tactics, the introduction of new technologies--will 
require R2.4-3.4 trillion in the prices of the third quarter of 
1993. This is to be financed from the state budget, foreign aid, 
and private investments from within Russia. As for foreign 
investments, during the next 1.5 to two years the United States 
is promising Russia aid with equipment and technology for a 
total of $800 million, and Japan is promising another $100 
million. A number of Italian and German firms are expected to 
participate. So far, in the words of Nikolay Shumkov, chief of 
the main administration for guarantee of supervision and 
salvaging of arms of the Russian Committee on the Defense 
Industry, R2 billion of Russian origin can be considered real 
investments. Taking the budget deficit into account, this will 
be another problem in converting Russia's defense complex. 
<H5>  Prices in Russia--Higher Than World Prices </H5>
  In 1993 (according to data from the Ministry of Economics), 
prices of certain kinds of foods that make up the basis of the 
subsistence minimum of the population of Russia were equal to 
world prices or higher. 
  In particular, the price of one tonne of sugar in Russia 
reached $650, while its price on the world market was $350, 
vegetable oil--$1,300 and $660 respectively; beef--$1,900 and 
$480 respectively; butter--$1,900 and $1,700; pollack--$700 and 
$400; and flour--$280 and $215. In 1994 the prices of these and 
certain other products on the domestic market could rise 
significantly (up to 1.5-twofold). 
<H5>  Who Will Buy the Land </H5>
  In the opinion of specialists of the Russian Agency for 
Investments and Real Estate, the land market in the Moscow area 
has already taken form and the current tendencies in supply and 
demand will continue in the future. 
  Up to this point the buyers have been commercial banks, 
which 
have acquired the right to own plots of land and now intend to 
turn them into private property. 
  The sellers are entrepreneurial structures, local 
administrations, and joint-stock sovkhozes that are experiencing 
a critical need for money. Recently there have been so-called 
pure firms which were created especially for buying and selling 
land. The object of the transactions of the present day are 
mainly sections of land of up to 10 hectares. Of the total 
demand, 90 percent is for sections for suburban homes. The 
buyers are not only the future homeowners but also firms that 
intend to build cottages for subsequent sale. Of the plots that 
are acquired, 2 percent are intended for entrepreneurial 
activity, mainly for construction of gas stations and 
campgrounds, and 8 percent of the applications are for garden 
plots. In a year and a half not a single plot has been acquired 
for organizing any kind of agricultural production.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Rybak: "The Defense Industry Product Is </F>
69 Percent Peaceful: But One-Third of the Personnel of the 
Military-Industrial Complex `Still Works for War'"] 
  [Text] According to figures of the State Committee of the 
Russian Federation for Statistics, the decline in production 
last year affected civilian enterprises to a greater extent than 
defense enterprises: conversion was undertaken at 716 of 
them--98 percent of the total. The product manufactured last 
year constituted 83.8 percent of that of the year before, 
including 86 percent at conversion enterprises. At the same time 
the extent of the basic defense order at plants and factories of 
the military-industrial complex is declining: The share of the 
"profile" product in their total output declined from 52 percent 
in 1990 to 31 percent last year. 
  Similar proportions may be observed also in respect to the 
persons employed in the production of peaceful commodities and 
those destined for the army: One-third of the employees of 
enterprises of defense industry were employed last year in the 
manufacture of "profile" products, although 48 percent of 
personnel had been working on "peaceful products" in 1990 even. 
  But the situation in the military-industrial complex was 
more 
complicated than in other sectors: The level of pay was 
approximately one-third below that of industry as a whole, and 
numbers of the personnel in the year declined 12 percent, which 
was 10 percent more than in mechanical engineering and double 
that of industry as a whole. Some 165,000 persons were released 
from conversion enterprises last year, and the debt for 
purchased products constituted R1.2 trillion, and debts to 
suppliers past due, R854 billion. 
  The directors of the defense works are attempting to emerge 
from the current situation independently: Thus in the funding 
structure the proportion of resources allocated from the federal 
budget for enterprises due for conversion constituted in 1993 
some 21 percent compared with 24 percent in 1992. But the 
proportion of borrowed funds in the funding of conversion 
increased from 41 percent to 44 percent, on the other hand--this 
being mainly bank credit--but only 0.3 percent of all borrowed 
money came from foreign investors. 
  Eighteen percent of the products manufactured by the 
conversion enterprises was shipped outside of Russia in 1993, 
and military equipment and arms constituted one-third of export 
supplies.

<F P=106> [Report "From Data of the Russian State Committee on </F>
Statistics": "Numerical Strength and Wages of Workers and Other 
Employees in Industry of the Russian Federation in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993 the number of workers and other employees 
working in industry totalled 19 million. Over half of them (55 
percent) worked at enterprises of state or municipal ownership, 
a third--at enterprises with mixed form of ownership, and 11 
percent--at private enterprises (in 1992 these figures were 57 
percent, 33 percent, and 10 percent, respectively). 
  While production volume decreased 16 percent in 1993, the 
number of employees in the sector diminished by 5 percent. This 
is related to the fact that enterprises are in no hurry to 
reduce their excess labor force, hoping that current economic 
difficulties are temporary in nature. 
  Even under conditions of shortages of materials, raw 
materials, fuel, and component parts, and problems in the 
marketing of production output, many enterprises, in their 
striving to retain personnel, are effecting transition to 
operations with reduced work periods and are affording employees 
supplemental unpaid or partially paid leave. 
  As of 1 January 1994, more than 7 percent of the people 
employed in industry were working less-than-full work periods. 
This includes 14 percent of workers in the light industry sector 
and 11 percent of those in machine building. 
  From 5 to 14 percent monthly of the workers at enterprises 
where work was halted were on supplemental leave at the 
initiative of the administration. For workers in light industry, 
this figure reached up to 20 percent for certain months. 
  The following table characterizes the data on changes in 
numerical strength and wage level of employees in the main 
sectors of industry in 1993:

  Under the influence of intensified sector wage 
differentiation, the level of wages in the fuel industry and 
electric power industry in 1993 being triple the wages in light 
industry and machine building (in 1991 the factor increase was 
1.5- to 1.7-fold), an intersector modulation of numbers of 
employees is taking place. This is increasing appreciably in the 
electric power industry and fuel industry, and decreasing in the 
lumber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Belyanov, candidate of economic </F>
sciences: "A Decline Without Signs of an Upswing: What Monthly 
Surveys of Industrial Enterprise Leaders Showed in 1993" 
  [Text] DELOVOY MIR regularly acquaints its readers 
with the results of the monthly surveys of industrial enterprise 
directors, which the editors of the independent ROSSIYSKIY 
EKONOMICHESKIY BAROMETR bulletin have conducted since December 
1991. This publication is now offering the aggregate results of 
these surveys during 1993. The editors accumulated the material 
from two years of statistical samplings. Readers, who are 
interested in the dynamics of the data obtained, can go to the 
final publication of the data for 1992 (DELOVOY MIR dated 25 
March 1993) and the 1993 quarters (DELOVOY MIR dated 28 August 
1993 and 11 January 1994). 
  We would remind you that the respondents are approximately 
150 industrial enterprise directors from various regions of 
Russia. The enterprises are mid-size (the number of workers is 
800-1200 people) and the percentage of state ones among them 
decreased from 50 percent to 25 percent during 1993. They 
operate basically in the domestic market. Speaking briefly, they 
are typical Russian enterprises devoid of monopoly benefits 
which found themselves one by one in the market. 
  One should emphasize the reliability and high accuracy of 
the 
directors' evaluations. A good knowledge of actual economic 
practices, competence and responsibility for their judgments are 
displayed in the appraisals. 
  Let us compare the directors' appraisals of management 
results in 1993 with their forecasts of the expected results for 
last year and the first six months of 1994 (see Table 1).

  First of all, let us point out that the data is convincing 
evidence of the high accuracy in the directors' forecasts. 
Differing somewhat from the actual results (this is completely 
normal), these forecasts reliably reflect general development 
trends. On the whole, these appraisals are not noted for 
optimism although they contain details of no small importance, 
which deserve attention. 
  There is, perhaps, only one noticeable deviation from the 
indicators in official statistics. The directors' appraisals of 
the actual volume of products, work and services practically do 
not state their decline (as it follows from the State Committee 
for Statistics data) but rather reveal a marking time. A 
previous survey made the assumption that this is explained by 
the specific nature of the responding enterprises: Being 
mid-size, they display greater stability than large and small 
firms. Spot conversations with the enterprise directors 
apparently confirm our version. 
  Other indicators correspond to the description of the 
situation as a typically crisis one. The number of workers is 
frozen or is being reduced. A general increase in prices, in 
whose structure purchase prices are outstripping sales prices, 
is continuing. The financial condition of the enterprises is 
worsening. The labor costs (wages) are lagging behind price 
increases in their growth. 
  A certain slowdown in the growth rate of prices (and this 
means of inflation also) is reassuring to some degree: During 
the second half of 1993, these rates decreased and, during the 
first half of 1994, the directors expect a further, although 
small, slowdown in price increases. It is also impossible not to 
see that the percentage of those, who expect a worsening of the 
financial situation in their enterprises by the middle of 1994, 
has decreased 1.5-fold. 
  However, the situation with investments, which are rapidly 
being reduced, is extinguishing this weak spark of hope. In such 
a case, where can one expect an upswing if there is no growth in 
capital investments and no modernization of the production 
system? 
  According to the survey data, the actual volume of capital 
investments in June 1993 was 61 percent of the December 1992 
level and in December 1993 it was 52 percent of the June 1993 
level. The directors expect that it will equal 41 percent of the 
December 1993 level in June 1994. These data correspond to the 
long-term estimates of demand for production capacities and 
manpower (see Table 2). 


Table 2. Availability of Production Capacities and Complete Manpower Staffing 
Relative to the Demand for Enterprise Products, Expected in the Next 12 Months 
(as a percentage of those surveyed) 

Possible answers        When answer obtained 

                        June 1993       September 1993       December 1993 

A. Availability of production capacities: 

1. Surplus              21              32                   38 

2. Normal               55              40                   47 

3. Insufficient         25              28                   15 

B. Complete manpower staffing: 

1. Surplus              16              29                   32 

2. Normal               57              49                   56 

3. Insufficient         26              22                   22 


  As we see, the percentage of those enterprises, which 
possess 
surplus material and labor resources, increased during 1993 and 
the percentage of those enterprises, which experienced a 
shortage of them, decreased. 
  A conclusion about the non-typical nature of the Russian 
crisis suggests itself. The fact is that the prolonged slump 
(despite a certain slowdown in it) is not displaying the 
beginnings of an upswing. The directors steadily predict that 
approximately another five years are required before the crisis 
ends. This is very similar to the fact that an upswing is 
generally not expected on the Russian economy's present path. It 
is simply slipping down to another, narrower and primitive, 
level of development -- to another, narrower, orbit of economic 
life from which, as the historical experience of developing 
countries confirms, it is practically impossible to set off for 
the heights of civilization.

  The answers received do not contain any justification for 
other interpretations: The crisis in the financial area and the 
sales crisis connected with it hindered production during all of 
1993. 
  Let us point out that, among the financial reasons reining 
in 
the economy's normal functioning, it is not strictly market 
factors but an administrative smothering of growth that is 
showing through more and more clearly. Indeed, whereas the 
impact of the price factor (59 percent of those answering in 
January 1993) occupied first place at the beginning of 1993, 
this factor moved to second place in the middle of the year 
despite the continuing increase in prices, yielding first place 
to the shortage of financial assets in the enterprises. It had 
moved to third place by the end of the year, having been passed 
by high taxes. Moreover, the impact of the two leading factors 
(in the opinion of 65 percent of those responding) was so strong 
by the end of 1993 that it began to restrain the role of the 
price factor (it decreased to 52 percent). This aggravated the 
sales problem and made the effect of the resource factors 
(equipment, manpower, raw materials, etc.) as well as that of 
management and the privatization process practically 
insignificant. 
  Thus, from the middle of 1993, the centralized establishment 
of high prices and refinancing rates became the main reason 
slowing down economic growth, especially investment dynamics. 
  An unpleasant fact like the intensification of the trend 
toward in-kind exchange, was also detected (especially during 
the second half of 1993). The percentage of barter deals in the 
enterprises' turnover grew during the second half of the year 
from 9 to 11 percent. The proportion of enterprises marked by an 
increase in this percentage rose from 18 to 34 percent. There is 
a basis for assuming that these data are objectively 
underestimated even if only because mutual deliveries in 
accordance with clearing agreements are normally not stated as 
an in-kind exchange. 
  I will repeat the conclusion contained in the previous 
survey: The primarily monetarist approach to stimulating the 
market is beginning to kill the market itself. In this 
situation, one cannot exclude an alternative where the growing 
uncontrolled nature of the economy will make a shift to strictly 
centralized regulation inevitable.

  In this table, the concentration of factors is less rigid 
than in Table 2; however, we see even here the priority of the 
money factor -- primarily, nonpayments by buyers and the 
difficulties in repaying loans to suppliers and banks. 
  At the end of the year, a strengthening in the requirements 
of commodity markets appeared: The percentage of respondents, 
who mentioned finding new sales markets and changing the 
composition of produced products as the leading ways to adapt to 
actual conditions, grew somewhat. At the same time, the problems 
in finding raw material suppliers slackened off. Unfortunately, 
these changes hardly signal a sudden change in the economy's 
dynamics. Rather, the present sales problems connected with the 
search for solvent buyers is having an effect here. 
  It is regrettable that the problems in the production area 
are still being moved to one of the last places: In November 
1993, only 14 percent of those surveyed saw the way out of the 
situation to be the expansion of production capabilities. This 
indicator had significantly decreased in comparison with August 
when it was 22 percent. The actual economic situation is not 
disposed to expanding production. 
  Only one percent of the respondents said: "Everything is 
normal." These same people, when they were asked: "In your 
opinion, what is most important now for the Russian economy?" 
replied almost unanimously: "Stimulating production" (see Table 
5).

  The following generalization suggests itself. The answers 
contained in Table 4 show short-term and tactical estimates of 
ways for enterprises to get out of the serious condition in 
which the crisis and volitional variants of the economic reforms 
have placed them. The data in Table 5 state the long-term and 
strategic plans of true experts on economic activity, whose 
confidence in the priority of a concern for stimulating 
production is rapidly growing: In October 1993, 66 percent of 
the respondents thought this and, after only a month, in 
November -- 73 percent. Of course, they are not supporters of an 
inflationary element. They simply do not believe in the 
miracle-working nature of monopolizing the manipulation of 
monetary levers. 
<H5>  The Main Danger Is the Destruction of the Production System </H5>
  Alarming phenomena in the area of production characterized 
last year. An increase in the irreversible processes destroying 
the production system became more and more evident. The 
prolonged decline is holding out fewer and fewer chances for the 
system's rapid rebirth in an ultra-modern form. 
  An absolute decrease in production capacities occurred 
during 
the entire year: In December 1993, their volume was 10 percent 
less than in December 1992. Approximately seven percent of the 
existing capacities will never be used in the opinion of the 
respondents. Those who answered listed another 15 percent of 
operating production capacities with those incurring losses 
during the second half of 1993. This means that they are 
candidates for retirement. Even the remaining, more effective, 
labor weapons are functioning in a weakened condition. According 
to the data of the monthly surveys, the workload level of 
production capacities was within the 70-75 percent range of the 
level which the directors estimated as normal. This indicator 
decreased to 69 percent in December from 76 percent in 
January-February and 78 percent in March. The percentage of 
enterprises, where the workload level of production capacities 
increased, varied little by quarter: 8-13 percent in the first 
quarter, 9-14 percent in the second, 6-13 percent in the third, 
and 7-9 percent in the fourth. The percentage of enterprises, 
where this indicator decreased, grew from 25-31 percent in the 
first quarter to 38-52 percent in the fourth. 
  However, the trouble lies not only and not so much in such 
crisis phenomena. It is known that obsolete and inefficient 
equipment, technologies, etc., should disappear naturally during 
an economic decline, yielding their place to new and efficient 
ones. However, the trouble is that the old ones are growing old 
and new ones are not being born. 
<H5>  The Paralysis in Investments Is Robbing the Future </H5>
  In comparison with the corresponding period of 1992, the 
directors estimated the total volume of capital investments 
during the first half of 1993 at 59 percent, and during the 
second half -- at 55 percent. They explain this by the following 
reasons (see Table 6 where it was necessary to select three of 
the suggested answers).

reasons 


  As is evident from the data cited in the table, the 
financial 
crisis has fettered the dynamics of capital investment. Again, 
we observe how the paralyzing grasp of administrative monetarist 
measures has grown from month to month. The pressure of bank 
interest rates has increased literally by fits and starts: In 
January 1993, only 16 percent of the respondents saw in it a 
barrier on the investment path but, in December, they were 42 
percent of all those completing the questionnaire. Before the 
fourth quarter, the effect of such a market factor as high 
prices for equipment, construction, etc., dominated. However, 
the shortage of ruble assets was literally treading on its 
heels. It won: The answers received in December 1993 put the 
primacy of the monetary famine into the minutes. Undoubtedly, 
this is the result of the present tax and credit policy. If one 
adds to this the pressure of existing debts (75 percent of the 
enterprises' nonpayments are explained by their lack of assets; 
the enterprises' debt to banks grew by 64 percent during the 
second half of 1993), we receive practically a complete set of 
the main barriers to growth. All of them are related to the 
monetary area (excluding hard currency relations, about which 
many spoke but which do not play a substantial role in the 
national economic mechanism but which are parasitic on it, 
diverting financial resources to speculative mergers). The 
effect of the other reasons, including the fashionable 
privatization processes, are completely insignificant. 
<H5>  The Making of the Economic Structure a Primitive One Is </H5>
Intensifying 
  Last year did not bring any positive changes in the 
structure 
of investments (see Table 7).

modernization, 
repairs 


  As is seen from the data in the table, only 25-33 percent of 
the capital investments went to expand production capacities, 
and all the rest -- to patching up the obsolete production 
system. The proportion of expenditures on the passive elements 
of production capital (42-54 percent) is high. The percentage of 
investments in nonproduction capital is declining (from 30 
percent in the first half of 1993 to 25 percent in the second). 
This means that social problems are increasing in enterprises. 
The credit policy has hobbled the possibility for using 
attracted assets, whose percentage in the form of credits and 
income from the issuance of stock shares during the first half 
of the year was only 25 percent among the sources of capital 
investments. According to the monthly survey data, 47-57 percent 
of the enterprises, on the whole, did not make any equipment 
purchases. 
  All of these are serious symptoms of a grave illness fraught 
with losing the capability for receptivity to advanced 
technology -- a reduction in the need to use new and the latest 
scientific and technical solutions. 
<H5>  Economic Reforming </H5>
  The answers to the December questionnaire, which contained a 
number of questions included for the first time, yielded some 
new information. The absence of its dynamics still does not 
permit making any generalization; however, the information 
itself can be of definite interest. 
  Among the enterprise respondents, 69 percent have already 
undergone the privatization process. The majority (55 percent) 
prefer its second version, 20 percent selected the first 
version, and only 2 percent -- the third; 23 percent were 
inclined to different versions. 
  Among the holders of the sold shares, labor collectives (66 
percent of those responding) are in first place; next come the 
local branches of the Federal Property Fund (38 percent), 
enterprise administrations (26 percent), investment funds (16 
percent), other enterprises (15 percent), banks (3 percent), and 
other owners (12 percent). A total of 27 percent of the 
enterprise respondents hold shares of other enterprises, and 47 
percent --shares of banks. General stockholder meetings have 
already taken place in half of the privatized enterprises (49 
percent). 
  The majority of privatized enterprise (55 percent) have 
formed councils of directors. Almost everywhere, their 
composition includes representatives of the administration (98 
percent of the surveyed enterprises) and labor collectives (82 
percent) as well as representatives of the Fund for Federal 
Property (75 percent), other enterprises (36 percent), banks 
holding shares of enterprises (18 percent), investment funds (16 
percent) and other enterprise shareholders (32 percent). 
<H5>  Dissatisfaction With the Government's Economic Policy </H5>
  In conclusion, we will cite the answers of enterprise 
directors, which describe their attitude toward the government's 
economic policy (see Table 8).

C. What have been the results from implementing the government's economic policy for 
your enterprise relative to other Russian enterprises?

enterprise 
gained (or 
lost less 
than 
others) 


  We have deliberately included in this table the results of 
all the replies that we have (these questions were on seven 
questionnaires during the last two years of sampling). This 
selection over a protracted period convinces us of the 
persistent constancy of the opinions characteristic of the 
director body. 
  During the two years that the statistical survey has been 
conducted (these years embrace the entire period following the 
price liberalization), less than a tenth of the respondents 
declared their understanding of the government's economic 
policy. In the middle of 1992, they were eight percent, and at 
the end of 1993 -- only four percent. An even smaller part of 
the directors considered this policy correct: five percent in 
the middle of 1992 and only one percent at the end of 1993. 
Almost half of the respondents habitually state that they 
suffered losses from implementing this policy (in 1993, they 
ranged from 42 to 51 percent); in turn, those maintaining the 
opposite were significantly fewer (from 8 to 20 percent). 
  We took the data of the entire period of the statistical 
survey because they are practically not connected with the 
change in the composition of the government and with the change 
in its leaders. Rather, an appraisal is given not of some former 
or current members or other of the government but of its policy 
itself. 
  Of course, one cannot ignore the extensive criticism 
addressed to the director body, whose representatives are the 
respondents. However, we have no other production directors and 
they will not appear by magic. Whether one wishes it or not, one 
must take the opinion of experienced practical workers into 
consideration. Generally speaking, can one seriously maintain 
that several dozen and even hundreds of the directors' critics 
are keeping pace but that thousands and tens of thousands of 
functioning managers (along with other enterprise management 
personnel -- hundreds of thousands) are not keeping pace? 
<H5>  Brief Conclusions </H5>
  1. The results of the surveys of directors during 1993 
revealed alarming trends in the prolonged decline that are 
acquiring the features of an irreversible loss, among which the 
most dangerous are the signs of the destruction of the 
production system and the privatization of the economic 
structure. 
  2. The directors' replies do not reveal any signs of an end 
to the crisis and the approach of an economic upswing. The 
continuing reduction in capital investments and the total 
paralysis of the investment process primarily testify to this. 
  3. It looks as if the economic reforming, which is being 
carried out, is beginning to give birth to anti-market 
tendencies: in-kind exchange, the strengthening of directive 
financial measures, an increase in feeble monopolistic efforts, 
instead of a movement toward a market economy. 
  4. The directors are convinced of the priority of 
stimulating 
production and, correspondingly, of the low effectiveness of 
purely monetary levers. 
  5. The survey results obtained reveal quite clearly the 
unpopularity of the government's economic policy among the 
directors -- an unpopularity with the policy of this or that 
composition of the government.

<F P=106> [Report from data of the Russian Federation State Committee </F>
on Statistics: "Industry: The Decline Continues"] 
  [Text] In January-February of this year, Russia's industry 
yielded production output amounting to 34 trillion rubles [R] in 
current prices, including about R18 trillion in the month of 
February. Physical volume of production decreased by 23.6 
percent as compared with January-February of last year, 
including by 23.1 percent in January and by 24.1 percent in 
February. 
  In January-February 1994, of 406 of the most important 
production varieties taken into periodic-accounting 
consideration, production volume increased over January-February 
1993 levels for 37 entries and decreased for 362 entries. 
  Over the first two months of this year, 50.5 million tonnes 
of oil, including gas condensate, were extracted--13 percent 
less than the January-February 1993 level. Some 50.3 million 
tonnes of coal were extracted (8 percent less) and 109 billion 
cubic meters of gas (on the level of the first two months of 
last year). 
  In ferrous metallurgy, the production lag in 
January-February 
1994 behind last year's levels were as follows: for output of 
cast iron--20 percent, steel--26 percent, finished rolled 
metal--22 percent, and steel pipe--48 percent. 
  In machine building over the January-February period of this 
year, production output constituted 50 percent or less of the 
level for the same period of last year for half the products 
taken into account (metal-cutting machine tools, forging and 
pressing machines, bulldozers, freight cars, tractors, trucks, 
grain-harvesting combines, forage harvesters, and others). 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry, the production 
decline continued in February of this year for the majority of 
the most important production varieties. In general over the 
two-month period, output of synthetic ammonia decreased by 26 
percent, sulfuric acid--by 30 percent, soda ash--by 53 percent, 
mineral fertilizers--by 29 percent, chemical fibers and 
filaments--by 49 percent, and motor vehicle tires--by 41 
percent. A reduction of more than half was seen with respect to 
the production of thermoplastic pipe and pipeline components, 
fiberglass and fiberglass products; output of chemical plant 
protection preparations was reduced by two-thirds. The 
production of tires for agricultural machinery came to less than 
a third of last year's level. 
  In January-February 1994, production of consumer goods 
decreased 27 percent from the level of the same period last 
year, including by 31 percent for nonfood products and by 17 
percent for food products. 
  In light industry, the output of socks, hosiery, and knitted 
articles decreased by 27 percent, footwear--by 54 percent, 
woolen fabrics--by 53 percent, silk fabrics--by 61 percent, 
flax, hemp, and jute fabrics--by 45 percent. The production of 
cotton fabrics increased 22 percent. 
  A significant reduction was seen in January-February of this 
year as compared to the same period of last year in the 
production output of most garments: overcoats and light 
overcoats--by two-thirds, jackets, raincoats, suits, trousers, 
and skirts--by almost half, shirts and dresses--by 22-28 percent. 
  The chief reason for the production decline remains 
enterprises' lack of working capital and problems in production 
output sales due to the high prices. 
  Diminished production volume was seen with respect to the 
majority of cultural and domestic items over the first two 
months of the year: refrigerators and freezers--by 2 percent, 
washing machines--by 42 percent, tape recorders--by 56 percent, 
television sets--by 17 percent, porcelain, pottery, and majolica 
dishware--by 22 percent. 
  In January-February of this year, the output of two- and 
three-compartment refrigerators and freezers increased over the 
level for the same period of last year. 
  The production volume of most food products was lower than 
in 
January-February of 1993: of meat--by 26 percent, whole milk 
production--by 17 percent, butter--by 31 percent, flour--by 17 
percent, cereals--by 34 percent. 
  Significant reductions over last year were seen with respect 
to the output of macaroni products, lump sugar, starch, and 
concentrated foods (by 37-50 percent), confectionery items and 
baker's yeast (by 15-20 percent). Output of baked bread and 
other bakery products was reduced by 13 percent. 
  Only half the production output of January-February 1993 
levels was attained with respect to vodka and vodka-based 
liquor, including 44 percent for February. 
  In February of this year, 4,300 enterprises in Russia had 
lengthy production stoppages for all or certain varieties of 
output. Work-time losses amounted to 22 million man-days, or 18 
percent of the time-sheet resources of these enterprises 
(analogous figures for February of last year: 2,400 enterprises, 
6 million man-days, 8.6 percent of time-sheet resources). 
  Some 22 percent of the workers at enterprises where work was 
discontinued were directed to take supplemental unpaid or 
partially paid leave in February at the initiative of management. 
  Twenty-eight enterprises of the fuel industry conducted 
strikes over the past month, resulting in a labor-time loss of 
60,000 man-days.

9 percent of the total number; 
  --Decreased with respect to 362 positions, or 89 
percent of the total number; with respect to 267 items (66 
percent of the total number), the output declined by one-quarter 
or more; among the latter: lubricant oils, metal cord, rolled 
sheet metal, diesels and diesel generators, low-power electric 
motors, trucks and passenger cars, tractor-drawn attachments, 
sulfuric acid, calcinated soda, chemical fibers and filaments, 
automotive tires, microbiological feed additive, commercial

<H5>  Quality of Consumer Goods </H5>
  In 1993, the Russian Federation State Inspection for Trade, 
Quality, and Consumer Rights Protection conducted 64,400 
inspections of consumer goods quality at industrial and trade 
enterprises; 62 percent of them resulted in finding the goods 
defective. 
  Quality of individual categories of goods is characterized 
by 
the following data: 


                         Found defective, grade reduced 

                         quantity            as % of total volume of

  At the Pestovskiy Meat Combine joint-stock society in 
Novgorod Oblast, 67 percent of the inspected quantity of 
sausages were found below grade; at Magadanskaya sausage 
factory--40 percent; at Astrakhan city milk combine and the 
Olovyanniki butter plant in Chita Oblast--53 percent and 90 
percent of butter, respectively; at Birsk dry and fat-free milk 
combine in the Republic of Bashkortostan--40 percent of milk 
products; and at Kirov poultry factory--62 percent of eggs. 
  During one-time inspections, complete production batches of 
footwear were found defective at the TOO [limited liability 
partnership] Volzhane in Samara Oblast; TOO Kavkaz in Stavropol 
Kray, POO [expansion unidentified] Sportobuv in Sverdlovsk 
Oblast; and in one-third of inspected quantities of output at 
Astrakhan and Ivanovo footwear factories. Poor-quality garments 
were being produced by the Magnitogorsk garment factory in 
Chelyabinsk Oblast and the Borisoglebsk garment factory in 
Voronezh Oblast, and the PTShO [industrial-technical sewing 
association] Kuban in Krasnodar Kray, where the share of 
defective output amounted to 20-44 percent. 
<H5>  Deliveries of Mineral Fertilizer to Agriculture </H5>
  In January 1994, deliveries of mineral fertilizer for the 
needs of agriculture are characterized by the following data (in 
thousand tonnes). 


                 Delivered in   January 1994

potassium        14.6           7         8         22        91 


  The continuing decline in the production of mineral 
fertilizer (by 26 percent as compared to January 1993); 
increased exports (1.8-fold); and poor solvency of agricultural 
consumers resulted in fertilizer shipments to domestic market 
consumers falling by a factor of four in January as compared to 
January 1993. As a result, farms will get no more than 40 
percent of the needed quantities this year. In Russia as a 
whole, soil fertilization decreased as compared to 1990 by 57 
percent; fertilizer deliveries declined in all regions, but most 
of all in the following.

<H5>  Consumer Services </H5>
  Over the elapsed year the volume of consumer services, as 
reported by officially registered enterprises, amounted to R0.7 
trillion, which in current prices is nine times more than in 
1992 and in comparable prices--40 percent less. Services 
provided the population in rural areas account for 11 percent of 
the total volume (12 percent in 1992). 
  Distribution of consumer services by form of ownership in 
1993 is characterized by the following data (in percents of the 
volume of consumer services by category).

  Incidence of flu and acute respiratory infections was lower 
in January 1994 than in January 1993. However, an increase in 
the incidence of these infections has been registered in 
practically all 39 cities monitored by the Federal Flu and Acute 
Respiratory Disease Centers. In 20 of them, the incidence of 
these infections reached epidemic proportions between 14 and 20 
February. The greatest spike over the epidemic threshold was 
registered in Omsk (2.2-fold), Barnaul and Ufa (1.9-fold), 
Kemerovo, Nizhniy Novgorod (1.6-fold), Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan 
(1.5-fold), Kirov, Perm, and Chelyabinsk (1.4-fold). 
  According to the data of the Center for Prevention and 
Eradication of AIDS, in January 1994 13 human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)-infected persons were registered in January 1994. 
Overall as of 1 February, the official count of HIV-infected 
persons was 730 (including 282 children); of them, 133 persons 
had AIDS (90 children). Over the period since 1987, 104 
HIV-infected persons (63 children) had died, including 85 
persons (54 children) with AIDS. 
<H5>  Drug-Related Crimes </H5>
  In 1993 MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organs have 
uncovered on the territory of Russia 296 underground 
laboratories manufacturing various drugs (twice as many as in 
1992), including 54 in Perm Oblast, 32 in Smolensk Oblast, 29 in 
Orel Oblast, 24 in Magadan Oblast, 15 in Orenburg Oblast, and 25 
in Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast [Birobijan]. More than 
one-third of all laboratories were manufacturing opium, 14 
percent--marijuana, 9 percent--amphetamines, and 8 
percent--hashish. 
  The main types of drug-related crimes are characterized by 
the following data (in units):

  Increase in the incidence of drug-related crime was 
registered practically everywhere; the greatest was in Tver 
Oblast (eightfold), Republic of Karelia (sixfold), Ulyanovsk and 
Smolensk Oblasts (5-5.3-fold), Republics of Mari El and Altay, 
Murmansk, Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Kursk, Lipetsk, and Tambov 
Oblasts (3.2-3.9-fold). 
  Law enforcement organs confiscated 53.7 tonnes of drugs and 
controlled substances (a 2.5-fold increase as compared to 1992), 
34.8 tonnes of poppy straw (3.9-fold), 17.2 tonnes of marijuana 
(1.5-fold), 330 kg of hashish (by 4 percent), 260 kg of opium 
(threefold), and 226 kg of controlled substances (2.5-fold). 
  Criminal proceedings on drug-related charges were initiated 
in 1993 against 24,100 persons (a 27-percent increase), 
including 21,300 Russian citizens (a 23-percent increase), 
14,700 persons in the 18-30 age group (a 25-percent increase), 
and 2,100 women (1.7-fold increase). Juveniles numbered 1,900 
(17 percent). 
  As of 1 January 1994, 71,300 persons using drugs for 
nonmedicinal purposes were on record in the MVD organs, 
including 39,100 diagnosed as drug addicts. Of the total number 
of drug users on record, 40,400 (57 percent of the total on 
record) were in the 18-30 age group; 25,500 (36 percent) do not 
have a steady source of income; 21,000 (29 percent) had 
previously committed crimes; 11,500 (16 percent) are voluntarily 
undergoing treatment, and 18,600 (26 percent) avoid treatment. 
  This review was prepared using the data of the Russian 
State Committee on Statistics.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Vasilyev: "On the Verge of Bankruptcy"] </F>
  [Text] Today we can characterize the economic situation in 
which a majority of farms find themselves as being on the verge 
of bankruptcy. We are once again convinced of this fact after 
acquainting ourselves with the report entitled "Operational 
Results of the Agro-Industrial Complex and the Tasks for 1994," 
as prepared for the government by Minselkhoz [Ministry of 
Agriculture] of the RF [Russian Federation]. Many agricultural 
enterprises, as emphasized in this report, have not been paying 
wages for 3-4 months; for all practical purposes they have not 
been carrying out repairs on equipment, since they are unable to 
purchase spare parts and they are not supplying mineral 
fertilizer or accumulating fuel and lubricating materials for 
the spring sowing work. Some farms are even unable to purchase 
seed. There have been instances of funds not being available for 
acquiring the fuel needed for delivering the livestock products 
produced to the consumers. 
  For the most part, this critical situation in the rural 
areas 
has been conditioned by a considerable weakening in state 
support. During the 1991-1993 period, investments in 
agricultural production installations have declined by a factor 
of roughly sevenfold. Over the past two years, there has been a 
sharp decline in the capital-labor ratio and the equipment 
workload has increased. 
  And the damaging trend towards a decline in state assistance 
is continuing this year. Thus, approximately nine trillion 
rubles' worth of centralized credit resources are needed for 
farms, including private farms, the organizations which provide 
services for them and also food and processing enterprises for 
preparing for and carrying out spring field operations and also 
for their accounts with agricultural producers for products 
delivered last year. Plans call for only one-ninth of the 
mentioned amount of funds to be allocated for these purposes 
during the first quarter of this year. 
  And for development of the agro-industrial complex, 
Minekonomiki [Ministry of Economics] and Minfin [Ministry of 
Finance] call for a limit to be placed upon centralized capital 
investments, financed from the republic budget of the Russian 
Federation, in the amount of 2.8 trillion rubles. In comparable 
prices, this amounts to only 55 percent of the limit for 1993. 
  Meanwhile, the requirement for centralized capital 
investments for 1994, for carrying out the state special purpose 
federal programs and decrees for the support and development of 
individual regions for agriculture alone, according to estimates 
by Minselkhoz economists and as adopted by the government of the 
Russian Federation, exceeds 37 trillion rubles. Thus, state 
support for measures aimed at strengthening the logistical base 
for agriculture is in essence being discontinued and the 
carrying out of all programs adopted, including such an 
important one as "Improving Soil Fertility," is being delayed. 
  An analysis of the status of affairs in the agro-industrial 
complex, conducted by Minselkhoz specialists, reveals that the 
branch's crisis is intensifying. And this year, if the 
government fails to undertake the radical measures needed for 
strengthening the agricultural economy, we may witness a drastic 
decline in agricultural production.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Shcherbakov: "A Spoon, the Path To Dinner"] </F>
  [Text] "If this document had been adopted in early January, 
I would have succeeded in laying in a supply of fuel, in 
preparing good seed and in supplying fertilizer with 
pesticides," sighed a familiar Ryazan farmer who had come to the 
editorial office. "Now this fine paper is just being released to 
the regions and specific executive agents, as the flood-water 
removes the last snow from the fields." 
  Thus was the response to publication of the decree of the 
government of the Russian Federation entitled "Economic 
Conditions for the Functioning of the Agro-Industrial Complex of 
the Russian Federation in 1994," not only by this farmer but 
also by a majority of the country's APK [agro-industrial 
complex] workers, regardless of whether or not they work at 
collective farms, in joint-stock companies or conduct their own 
production operations. 
  Perhaps my acquaintance was largely correct, implying that a 
spoon provides the path to dinner. But what is to be done if, in 
the words of the vice premier of the government of the Russian 
Federation, A. Zaveryukha, uttered recently by him during a 
press conference for Russian and foreign journalists, this 
decree is experiencing difficulty in reaching the governmental 
and ministerial offices. During the course of prolonged 
discussions and coordination, the draft of the future decree was 
thoroughly "scaled down." Improvements were realized in those 
statutes in which specific figures were cited for financial and 
investment support for agriculture. 
  Be that as it may, the document was nevertheless published 
and has already started to work. According to data which became 
known to the edictorial board, 400 billion rubles have already 
been used for the repayment of debts for grain sold by 
agricultural producers. The indebtedness to enterprises and APK 
organizations for subsidies and compensation that were in effect 
during 1993 will be repaid during the first quarter. A similar 
operation will be carried out for debts associated with the 
capital construction volumes actually carried out at 
installations, the financing of which was implemented using 
federal budgetary funds. 
  Yes and what funds will be used for APK development this 
year? On the whole, appropriations for APK development are being 
maintained at the level for the funds actually allocated in 
1993, with the average coefficient for indexing expenditures of 
the federal budget being taken into account. In addition, four 
trillion rubles from the federal budgetary fund for financial 
support in behalf of the more important national economic 
branches of the Russian Federation are being allocated for 
agricultural development. 
  Certainly, not all of the financial problems will be 
resolved. Nevertheless, agricultural producers will receive 
strong assistance in the form of compensation for 30 percent of 
their expenditures for energy resources employed for the growing 
of vegetables on sheltered ground and also enterprises engaged 
in the primary processing of flax and hemp. Similar compensation 
will be provided for the acquisition of mineral fertilizer and 
agents for the chemical protection of plants. 
  Beyond any doubt, the fact that a number of statutes of the 
governmental decree call for a noticeable revival of investment 
policies in the agrarian sector of the economy is indeed 
reassuring. Thus, Minfin for the Russian Federation will this 
year assign no less than two thirds of the overall volume of 
funds being received in the federal budgetary fund for financial 
support for the more important national economic branches to a 
special sub-account entitled "Fund for Financial Support for 
Agriculture." The funds from this sub-account will be employed 
for specific programs, including for reconstruction and 
re-equipping, for expansion and new construction of 
installations of a production nature, for developing the 
logistical base for breeding enterprises and seed production 
farms and for land reclamation and nature conservation measures. 
  During the first six months, a governmental commission for 
credit policies and the Central Bank of Russia will allocate not 
less than five trillion rubles worth of centralized credit 
resources for the purchasing of fuel, seed, spare parts, mineral 
fertilizer and feed. A portion of this money, or more exactly 
1.3 trillion rubles, will be used for acquiring equipment, 
trucks and pedigree livestock. These credits will be issued for 
a period of up to three years, with annual repayment of 
indebtedness commencing 1 September and with simultaneous 
payment of interest. 
  In addition, the plans call for centralized capital 
investments in the amount of 2.8 trillion rubles and investment 
credit in the amount of 1.3 trillion rubles. 
  This money will be used for development and revival of the 
agrarian sector of the economy. They must serve in the role of a 
unique locomotive, one which pulls behind itself all of the 
national economic branches that are associated with agricultural 
production -- machine-building, chemistry, processing. 
  And a chief consideration is the fact that this money cannot 
be used for consumption. This is especially frightening to 
society and to those who oppose financial support for 
agriculture and do not encourage inflation. To the contrary, the 
revival of production operations in a whole series of national 
economic branches will serve as a reliable means for restraining 
the inflationary processes. 
  Measures are set forth in the decree for providing support 
for peasant (private farmer) farms. In particular, not less than 
15 percent of the capital investments called for in local 
budgets for the mentioned purposes will be allocated for the 
construction of installations for the social and production 
infrastructure. The plans call for monetary assistance for those 
families which resettle in rural areas. 
  The production volumes for agricultural products, which are 
maintained at the 1993 level, are set forth in the document. 
Federal food funds in response to state needs are being created 
and provision is being made for advancing funds on credit for 
products sold to these funds, in the amount of 50 percent of 
their value.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Semiletov, deputy chief of administration for </F>
price policy of the Ministry of Agricultural Production of the 
Russian Federation: "Held Captive By the Financial Deficit"] 
  [Text] The opinion persists that the large amounts of 
subsidies and compensation being issued by the state to 
agricultural producers in our country are being used 
ineffectively. Is this actually the case? Let us first compare 
the budgetary funds being made available to agricultural 
producers both here and abroad. Last year these payments, per 
hectare of sowing area in Russia, amounted to 10,000 rubles, or 
less than 10 dollars, and in the U.S.A. -- more than 90 dollars 
and almost the same amount in Canada. 
  As you can see, support for the agrarian sector in our 
country is negligible compared to that for states with developed 
market economies. It does not cover even a portion of the 
tremendous increase in the prices for resources, the result of 
severe inflation, excessive taxes and high credit rates. 
  Owing to the severe financial situation, the farms are no 
longer able to maintain the production potential created 
earlier. Last year the withdrawal of fixed capital in 
agriculture exceeded by fourfold the placing of such fixed 
capital in operation. The workload borne by existing equipment 
increased greatly and this is bringing about an increase in the 
periods of time required for carrying out agricultural 
operations and also shortfalls in the production of goods. 
Moreover, a considerable decline in investments is posing the 
threat of a drastic drop in productivity in field crop husbandry 
and, in the final analysis, in livestock husbandry operations. 
  Compared to 1991, when in order to procure one tractor and 
depending upon the machine model, the farms had to sell from 29 
to 43 tonnes of grain, today the figure is almost twice as much. 
And in order to purchase one tonne of mineral fertilizer, today 
they must sell 3-22 times more agricultural products, depending 
upon the type of product involved. Hence, earnings in 
agriculture are considerably lower than that in other branches. 
  Taking into account the non-equivalent exchange of products 
between cities and the countryside and the severe financial 
situation, importance is attached to increasing financial 
assistace for the agrarian sector. In our opinion, it must be 
directed primarily towards adapting the agricultural producers 
to market conditions, maintaining equivalence in inter-branch 
exchange, protecting peasants from competition by foreign 
entrepreneurs and towards the development of a market 
infrastructure and implementing measures aimed at 
demonopolization in the agrarian sphere. 
  Moreover, the state must present the farms with the required 
guarantees with regard to the sale of their products. They must 
signify that if producers, for one reason or another, are unable 
to sell their products through direct market channels, the state 
will procure them at firm prices declared in advance. Such a 
system will prompt the farms to develop the production of the 
needed agricultural goods.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Popov, Vice President of the Agrotekhnologiya </F>
[Agrotechnology] Joint Stock Society and candidate of 
agricultural sciences: "`Agrotekhnologiya' Is Getting Down to 
Work"] 
  [Text] Without exaggeration we can say that the country is 
now in a state of agricultural crisis, the essence of which has 
to do with the fact that village producers of agricultural 
products have either inadequate or no assets. The application of 
fertilizer has practically ceased, there is a shortage of 
equipment to carry out these operations, soil degradation is in 
progress, and the ecological balance is being violated. 
  It would seem that measures are being taken to correct this 
situation. Land relations have been secured through legal 
channels, and a multi-structural agricultural production base 
has been approved. Farming enterprises are being created side by 
side with large agricultural enterprises, the population is 
being given plots of land, and dacha [summer house] and 
horticultural-gardening cooperatives are being organized. 
Gradually, competition is developing among all village goods 
producers. This is the beginning of market ties and relations. 
  At the same time we have observed a multitude of negative 
processes that hinder movement along the selected market path in 
the economy. In particular, unnecessary fuss and haste have been 
exhibited in eliminating large enterprises and there have been 
attempts to forcefully introduce farming, whereas both processes 
should be voluntary. Large enterprises may become genuine 
collectives in the form of joint-stock societies, cooperatives 
or partnerships. Land, the means of production, and ultimately 
the results of work must belong to these collectives. Where 
conditions exist, farming enterprises are being created, and 
there should be no hindrance to this. Can it be that we cannot 
deal with this simple matter? I think that we can. Everyone must 
simply be a facilitator instead of interfering with the 
development of judicious multi-structural land ownership. 
  It is from these positions that economic transformation of 
the village should be managed. But very complicated problems 
arise in the process of reform. One of them is the use of 
chemical agents, equipment and scientific elaborations. 
  With the transition to market relations we have noted a 
negative tendency to partially or fully reject fertilizer in 
connection with its increased cost. Directors of enterprises say 
that for 1-2 years they will be able to do without the purchase 
of chemical agents and equipment by using existing reserves. 
Most likely this will not be a success -- working with a machine 
until it wears out will not yield good results. In addition, it 
could bring with it a curtailment in the production of chemical 
agents and a reorientation of production capacities. In other 
words, agriculture will simply exacerbate its predicament. We 
should consider that if a wheat yield of 15-20 quintals per 
hectare requires one pesticide treatment and the application of 
70-180 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, then a productivity 
of 30-35 quintals will require six pesticide treatments and 
300-420 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare. In this way, the 
noted tendency to refuse fertilizer, pesticides and new 
equipment will result in a sharp drop in soil fertility and thus 
in a significant decrease in the harvest. 
  In recent years ecological problems have become particularly 
urgent in agriculture. Avoiding pollution of soil and crops with 
chemical agents requires their balanced and comprehensive use on 
the basis of soil and leaf diagnostics. Effective and safe use 
is impossible without the newest machines and equipment and the 
leading technologies. 
  Ideas about the negative aspects of chemicals in agriculture 
are taking hold more and more firmly in the mass media. What is 
not mentioned is that in the entire world the knowledgeable use 
of large doses of mineral fertilizers is the foundation for 
producing large and stable harvests. Let me cite certain 
figures. In 1991 in the USSR, 120 kilograms of active substance 
was applied per hectare; in Holland -- 800. The productivity of 
grains equalled 18 and 70 quintals per hectare respectively. In 
the USSR pesticides were used on 30-35 percent of sowing area, 
in the U.S. -- on 90 percent, and in Japan -- on 100 percent of 
total area. Meanwhile, the life expectancy of an individual 
equals 70, 75 and 78 years respectively. 
  In this case what should concern us more today -- ecology or 
soil fertility and the size of the harvest? Obviously we should 
look at both without contrasting one with the other. Increasing 
the return on fertilizer should be one of our main tasks because 
it is still low here. The introduction of one kilogram of 
nutrients with fertilizers yields 7.3 kilograms of grain abroad 
and 3-5 kilograms in the Russian Federation. Expenditures of 
mineral fertilizers to produce a tonne of agricultural product 
is 2.6 times greater here than in the U.S.. 
  In connection with the difficult economic situation in the 
country, particularly within agricultural production, the 
agrochemical potential that has been developed since the early 
1970's (Selkhozkhimiya [Agrochemical] Specialized Association, 
agrochemical laboratories, and stations for chemicalization and 
plant protection), at the present time is collapsing, and in 
some places has already collapsed. Under these difficult 
conditions it is essential to seek new, non-traditional 
approaches not only to the agrochemical service, but to the 
entire complex of scientific-technical services within the new 
multi-structural agricultural production base as well. Most 
likely, direct ties between producers of agricultural products 
and enterprises that produce material-technical resources, as 
well as scientific-research and planning-research institutions 
will be of more and more significance. 
  For example, after the elimination of Soyuzselkhozkhimiya 
[All-Union Agricultural Chemical Association], the 
Agrotekhnologiya Joint Stock Society was created with the goal 
of further realizing accumulated scientific-technical potential 
and of effectively utilizing the highly trained specialists of 
this association's apparatus. Its founders include the Agrokhim 
Russian Agrochemical Company, Avtoselkhozmash [Agricultural 
Vehicle and Machinery] Holding Association, Rossiyskiye Semena 
[Russian Seed] Joint-Stock Society, and the Russian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences. We have selected contemporary 
scientific-technical supply of agroindustrial production as our 
main direction. Our clients and partners are kolkhozes, 
sovkhozes, joint-stock societies, partnerships, farmers, and 
individual land users regardless of form of ownership or 
management. All relations are built on direct contracts and a 
mutually advantageous foundation. 
  During last and this year the society has concluded 
contracts 
with large producers to assimilate intensive technologies for 
raising wheat, corn, sugar beets, potatoes, soybeans and other 
crops. We are carrying out this work jointly with enterprises, 
first and foremost, in large land-management regions -- 
Krasnodarskiy Kray, and Rostov, Voronezh, Orel, Belgorod, 
Lipetsk, Tambov, Tula, and Penza oblasts. 
  Everything begins with traditional technological maps, which 
with a consideration of agricultural resources, soil fertility 
and management-economic conditions, are made more precise by us 
jointly with agronomists and engineers from enterprises. In 
carrying out their obligations, our specialists are concerned 
about supplying enterprises with hybrid corn, peas and other 
seed, and satisfying demand for the most effective fertilizers, 
agricultural equipment and plant protection agents. 
Agrotechnological classes and seminars are held for workers of 
agricultural enterprises. In striving to alleviate financial 
problems, we try to sell these agricultural resources under 
favorable conditions and as inexpensively as possible for the 
consumer. We do not chase after super profits, and for this 
reason, overhead expenses are curtailed to 7-8 percent. 
Incidentally, enterprises pay us in money as well as in 
agricultural products. 
  In enterprises that have contracts with us, the productivity 
of grains and legumes, including corn, increased last year by an 
average of 3 quintals per hectare; of sugar beets -- by 30-50. A 
large savings in resources is achieved when they are utilized 
more effectively. 
  Another direction in our operations involves providing 
agricultural services to the small producer of agricultural 
products, beginning with the farmer and ending with the 
cultivators of dacha plots and members of horticultural-garden 
cooperatives. Unfortunately, we have not yet created an orderly 
system for supplying the population with technology and 
agricultural resources with stability. Farming enterprises have 
found themselves in particularly difficult circumstances because 
they are not supplied with chemical agents, small equipment, 
seed and scientific-technical elaborations either through the 
centralized supply system for kolkhozes, sovkhozes and 
joint-stock societies created on the basis of kolkhozes or 
sovkhozes or through government and cooperative trading, which 
has also undergone reforms everywhere, or through 
scientific-research institutions and the agronomic service. 
Nevertheless, practically all individual land users understand 
that without a positive solution to these problems it is 
impossible to cultivate a good harvest of most agricultural 
crops. 
  It is no secret to anyone that during moist years up to 
30-50 
percent of the potato harvest perishes from phytophthora, and of 
the cucumber harvest -- from peronosporosis. During dry years 
potato plantations become severely infested with the Colorado 
potato beetle. Individuals do not always have mineral 
fertilizer, seed and a horticultural inventory to carry out 
seasonal operations. Due to the absence of chemical ameliorative 
agents on the market the population loses up to 25-30 percent of 
harvest potential annually. In the Non-Chernozem Zone alone the 
demand for such agents equals over 7,000 tonnes annually. In 
connection with this, Agrotekhnologiya has begun to create local 
specialized partnerships to provide technological supplies to 
individual land users. At the present time such partnerships 
have been created in Moscow, Leningrad, Lipetsk, Belgorod, and 
Vladimir oblasts and Krasnodar Kray. This work is carried out in 
close cooperation with local Selkhozkhimiya associations. Last 
year partnerships fully supplied the demand for chemical 
ameliorative agents by over 60,000 individual land users. The 
society together with the Vitebsk Dolomit Production Association 
has organized the production of dolomite meal packed in small 
packages (5-25 kilograms). This is the best soil amelioration 
agent, containing the vital microelement magnesium in addition 
to calcium. 
  Agrochemical soil analyses on fine-contour farm plots and in 
dacha and horticultural-gardening cooperatives and technological 
consultations with land users on the effective and ecologically 
safe use of fertilizers and plant protection agents are provided 
jointly with chemicalization stations. 
  Through the system of partnerships individual land users are 
supplied with significant quantities of vegetable seed, the 
framework for dacha hothouses and hotbeds, panels, and 
horticultural-gardening inventory. 
  The simplest accounts show that improved availability to 
individual land users, especially farming (peasant) enterprises, 
of essential agricultural resources and technological services 
will enable them to greatly improve land productivity and to 
increase the production of potatoes, vegetables, fruit and 
livestock raising by 15-20 percent. 
  Such experience exists. The first positive results also 
exist. But they can be more weighty if we unify our efforts and 
the efforts of many other production-technical, 
commercial-supply, agronomic and variety seed farming 
organizations, including the structures of the RF Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food and of local agricultural organs.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Shcherbakov: "We Have the Resolution. We Do </F>
Not Have the Fuel"] 
  [Text] Last week the federation council passed a resolution 
on priority measures to secure the fulfillment of spring field 
work in the Russian Federation in 1994. The document, which was 
signed by V. Shumeyko, is short, consisting of only two points, 
but it would be difficult to overestimate its significance. In 
it, the federation council proposes that within a two-week 
period, the government of the Russian Federation solve the 
problem of allocating credit to the agroindustrial complex for 
the first six-month period in an amount equalling 6 trillion 
rubles, including 3 trillion rubles for the first quarter. In 
this way the upper house of the Russian parliament showed itself 
to be more generous than the government, which in its recent 
resolution on the economic conditions for the functioning of the 
APK [Agroindustrial complex] operations in 1994 was able to 
allocate only 5 trillion rubles for this purpose. Recall how 
many critical barbs the mass media, which considers itself to be 
democratic, directed in this regard at the government's deputy 
prime minister, A. Zaveryukha, who is responsible for the 
agricultural sector. By doing this, they said, the government 
was pushing the country into a new inflationary spiral. 
  Of course it is gratifying that the upper house of 
parliament 
has finally shown some concern for peasant needs. But the 
question immediately arises: Where were you before, respected 
deputies? After all, it is well known that the spring day feeds 
the year. Well, all right, perhaps before the snow melts the 
people of the north will see the effects of this document. But 
what about the people of the Kuban, Rostov and Stavropol? 
Incidentally, at a point at which the resolution of the 
federation council had not yet been signed, the farmers of 
Krasnodar Kray, having poured the last liters of fuel into 
tractor tanks, were already able to fertilize 200,000 hectares 
of winter crops out of a total of 1.5 million hectares. Winter 
crops were resown on 20,000 hectares where they had perished 
completely or were thin. This work must be done on a total of 
300,000 hectares. Will farmers complete it successfully? 
  It is no accident that on 1 March the new government 
commission on spring sowing and harvesting in 1994, chaired by 
the RF government's deputy prime minister, A. Zaveryukha, met 
for the first time this year. The discussion at the meeting was 
very alarming. 
  Russian agricultural workers must carry out spring sowing on 
67.4 million hectares, which is 4 million hectares more than 
last year. This can be explained by the fact that last fall for 
a number of reasons fewer late-fall plowed fields were raised 
and winter crops were not sown on 4 million hectares. In 
addition, due to crop loss it is necessary to resow winter crops 
on 2 million hectares. 
  V. Shcherbak, first RF deputy minister of agriculture and 
food, noted in his speech that Russia's agricultural enterprises 
have somewhat smaller supplies of spring crop seed, especially 
corn. 
  Yet this did not evoke as much concern among commission 
members as did the shortage of tractors, agricultural machinery 
and spare parts, oil and lubricating materials, mineral 
fertilizes and chemical plant protection agents. It is this, 
noted the meeting participants, that can seriously affect the 
course of spring field work. 
  As of early February one out of four tractors and trucks and 
about one-third of plows, cultivators and sowers were in a state 
of disrepair. As for diesel fuel and gasoline reserves in 
enterprises, prior to the beginning of the current sowing period 
they were significantly smaller than in preceding years. 
  Specialists confirm that uninterrupted equipment fuel 
supplies during spring field work is impossible if enterprises 
do not have a diesel fuel and gasoline reserves for at least 25 
days. At the present time enterprises have only 350,000 tonnes 
of diesel fuel compared to the norm of 1.3 million tonnes. 
Operations data from the RF Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
confirm that about 30 percent of enterprises have completely 
expended their available fuel reserves. One fifth of enterprises 
have only a 3-5 day reserve. Especially alarming is the 
curtailment of fuel reserves in regions and enterprises located 
at a distance from railroad stations because it is impossible to 
transport anything during the spring period when roads are bad. 
  In the opinion of commission members, the situation 
involving 
supplies of mineral fertilizers, seed-treatment chemicals and 
pesticides to enterprises for spring sowing is equally serious. 
Even if we supplied enterprises with a minimum quantity of 
mineral fertilizer calculated on the basis of 27 kilograms of 
active substance per hectare, we would still have a shortage of 
2.9 million tonnes of mineral fertilizer. In storehouses the 
remainder comprises only 400,000 tonnes. In January-February 
enterprises were able to procure another 200,000 tonnes. Thus, 
total reserves equal only 21 percent of the minimum needed. Let 
me remind you that just 5 years ago kolkhozes and sovkhozes 
applied 12.8 million tonnes of fertilizer to the harvest. This 
year they probably will not apply even 3.5 million tonnes. 
  Because of insolvency, village goods producers owe chemical 
combines 70 billion rubles. As a result, in order not to stop 
production, a significant portion of the fertilizer that is so 
needed by agriculture is exported. In order to stop this 
negative process even for a short time, the commission has 
decided to make a proposal to the government on halting the 
export of all forms of mineral fertilizer produced in Russia for 
a period of 3 months beginning 10 March of this year. 
  "Yes, this is not a market solution," noted Deputy Prime 
Minister A. Zaveryukha, "but we have no other today. Otherwise, 
we will leave the domestic goods producer without fertilizer, 
and this means without a harvest." 
  Commission members have given a great deal of attention to 
the financial problems of agriculture and its related branches 
of industry and to the deterioration of the system of mutual 
accounts and payments. The commission has complained about the 
Central Bank and the RF Ministry of Finance concerning the 
non-fulfillment, in its opinion, of the government's directives 
on the order for issuing credit to village goods producers and 
for canceling interest on such credit. 
  The commission noted a number of specific measures that 
would 
make serious corrections in the course of preparing for and 
carrying out spring sowing.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Zaveryukha, vice premier of the Government of </F>
Russia: "Related Sectors, One Interest"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Kharlampiyevich Zaveryukha was born 
in the settlement of the Sovkhoz imeni Elektrozavod in 
Novosergiyevskiy Rayon, Orenburg Oblast, in the prewar year of 
1940. He began his labor activity as a tractor operator on his 
native sovkhoz, from where he left to serve in the ranks of the 
Soviet Army. He came to the first course of the Orenburg 
Agricultural Institute with quite a rich life experience and 
serious labor and army training, which, obviously, was useful. 
The newly fledged agronomist grasped the rudiments of vocational 
skills after graduation from the higher educational institution 
when he assumed the post of chief economist of the Uran Sovkhoz 
in his native Novosergiyevskiy Rayon. He grasped them very 
successfully if after 3 years in the same rayon members of the 
Komsomolskiy Kolkhoz elected him their chairman. He worked in 
this post for 11 years. 
  In 1978 straight from the [post of] kolkhoz chairman, 
bypassing intermediate levels of authority, A.Kh. Zaveryukha 
right away was appointed deputy chief of the production 
administration of agriculture in the oblast, which he headed 
soon. Then he worked as first deputy chairman of the oblast 
agro-industrial committee and as chairman of the oblast soviet 
of agro-industrial formations. In 1992 he was appointed general 
director of the All-Russian Scientific Production Association of 
the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Beef Cattle 
Breeding. He defended his dissertation without giving up his 
work. He is candidate of economic sciences. 
  A.Kh. Zaveryukha, people's deputy of the Russian 
Federation, vice premier of the Government of Russia, among 
several national economic sectors, also manages the Russian 
Federal Forest Service. 
  From time immemorial two concepts--forest and arable 
land--have been indivisible in the consciousness of the Russian 
man. Time has confirmed with all obviousness: They cannot be 
examined separately--this is fraught with big losses. Successful 
work by peasants largely depends on the state of the country's 
agriculture and, naturally, they are vitally interested in 
seeing to it that forestry affairs are conducted competently and 
sensibly. 
  The state privatization program determines: Russia's forest 
lands are federal property and are not subject to privatization. 
The Federal Forest Service should now become the only owner of 
Russian forests. However, at the beginning of 1993 about 80 
percent of the country's forests were under its authority. As 
before, 7 million hectares of plantings are under the authority 
of various ministries and departments (the Ministry of Defense, 
hunting establishments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, 
and administrations of the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg). 
The Federal Forest Service and its local bodies, fulfilling the 
requirements of the new forest legislation, must immediately 
accept all forests and bear responsibility for their 
preservation and reproduction. When there is one owner in the 
forest, it will be possible to solve the problems of 
agricultural workers more successfully. 
  Agricultural workers count on forestry experts in many ways. 
They hope that state bodies for the sector's management, jointly 
with territorial bodies of power, will be able to solve the 
problem of leasing available plots of forest lands on favorable 
terms to timber cutters meeting the needs of rural dwellers for 
lumber. It is also necessary to examine with territorial bodies 
of power problems concerning the preferential supply of felled 
and sawn timber for the rural population. It would be advisable 
for the Russian Federal Forest Service to prepare on behalf of 
the government recommendations to territorial bodies of power 
about the free sale of dead-standing and windfallen trees to the 
population. 
  In 1993 forestry establishments of the Russian Federal 
Forest 
Service procured 18 million cubic meters of timber by way of 
improvement tree felling. This timber is used for the needs of 
the local (basically rural) population. The production cost of 
timber procured by forestry establishments is much lower than 
that of commercial structures. Moreover, in accordance with the 
president's edict the profit from the processing of timber from 
improvement felling is not taxed. To increase improvement 
felling volumes to scientifically substantiated norms and to 
more fully meet the needs of the rural population for timber and 
fuel are important tasks of forestry bodies. One would like 
forestry bodies to pay more attention to the farms that are 
being established. In particular, for their stabilization and 
support the Federal Forest Service must develop a program for 
leasing sections of forest lands to farmers on favorable terms. 
  Soil erosion does irreparable damage to land resources, the 
environment, and our economy. The soil of eroded and 
erosion-dangerous agricultural areas now makes up 56 percent. 
Erosion annually devours about 1 and 1/2 billion tonnes of 
fertile soil. The president of the Russian Federation and the 
Government of Russia are disturbed by the existing situation 
with the protection of land against degradation. Urgent actions 
are necessary. The examination of this matter was referred to 
the Security Council of the Russian Federation. In erosion 
control it is difficult to overestimate the significance of 
forest reclamation measures. Field-protective forest belts 
ensure not only soil protection against erosion, but, at the 
same time, greatly increase harvests and lower production costs. 
  The afforestation of gully and ravine systems eliminates 
their desiccating and draining effect on adjoining territories 
and brings destroyed lands back into the economic turnover. The 
forest reclamation of sandy lands and arid pastures counteracts 
deflation processes to a considerable extent and makes it 
possible to obtain a variety of agricultural and forestry 
products scarce in these regions. For example, 3 to 5 hectares 
of sand in the Lower Volga Area put into agricultural turnover 
under the protection of forest plantings are equivalent in plant 
output to 1 irrigated hectare of high-grade soil. For the 
complete protection of agricultural land in the Russian 
Federation it is necessary to have 12.3 million hectares of 
forest belts. 
  The long-term plan for anti-erosion measures determined the 
immediate volumes of work on protective afforestation--5.1 
million hectares. A total of 2.9 million--only one-fourth of the 
scientifically substantiated need--were established. The program 
for an increase in Russia's soil fertility envisaged the 
establishment of 252,000 hectares of all types of protective 
plantings in 1992-1993. According to preliminary data, execution 
will make up 60 percent. Why have the volumes of work been 
curtailed? Local agricultural enterprises refuse to allocate 
land plots for forest plantings (this problem is aggravated 
owing to the change in the forms of land ownership) and problems 
concerning the financing of this work are solved poorly. 
  Russia's forests represent a vast storeroom for the 
replenishment of food in the country through the use of 
wild-growing berries, mushrooms, nuts, medicinal raw materials, 
and other gifts of the forest. For now, however, these resources 
are utilized poorly. In the last 2 years the procurement of 
wild-growing fruits and berries has decreased by a factor of 
five and of medicinal-technical raw materials, by a factor of 
more than two. There is a similar picture with respect to other 
indicators. But forestry experts in the Republic of Kalmykia and 
in Vologda, Karachayevo-Cherkess, and Kemerovo forestry 
administrations have been able to organize work quite well. 
  Russian forests have many honey-bearing resources, which 
creates a good basis for the development of bee-keeping. This 
potential is also by no means fully utilized everywhere. Whereas 
Tatarstan annually procures honey at the level of 340 quintals, 
Samara Oblast, 140, Altay Kray, 210, and Sakhalin, 335, 
Krasnodar Kray, only at the level of 60 quintals and the 
Republic of Mari El, 31. Honey production is also poorly 
organized in a number of other regions. 
  Forestry establishments have plenty of opportunities to 
develop subsidiary farms. However, the results of work in 1993 
point to an alarming situation with the supply of products of 
agricultural production. Whereas in 1991 subsidiary farms of 
forestry establishments produced almost 12,000 tonnes of meat, 
which is more than 30 kg per worker, in 1993 they produced only 
about 8,000 tonnes. Forestry experts in Vladimir, Pskov, 
Smolensk, and a number of other forestry administrations 
unjustifiably refused to manage subsidiary farms. They 
transferred up to 90 percent of the available livestock to 
various structures under a department of the industrial sphere. 
  But forestry experts in the Udmurt Republic and Voronezh, 
Tambov, Tula, Rostov, Kurgan, and Kemerovo oblasts, despite 
difficulties, not only have preserved the production of 
agricultural products, but also have a rise in basic indicators. 
In brief, under the most difficult conditions of the 
transitional period of the market economy, with a desire and a 
skillful approach it is possible to have one's own meat, milk, 
and other products, which becomes a good support for workers. 
  I deliberately do not dwell here on the "pure" problems of 
forestry--a great deal is written about this in the pages of 
LESNAYA GAZETA. Nevertheless, it is worth talking about one. 
  It is known that, owing to the reduction in production and 
the sharp rise in the cost of machinery, the degree of equipment 
of forestry establishments with labor-saving and ecologically 
safe machines and mechanisms used in improvement felling, in 
reforestation, and in other operations has dropped in recent 
years. Therefore, proposals on granting goal-oriented 
preferential credits for the purchase of machinery, which 
contributes to an increase in the volumes of forest tending and 
to an improvement in its quality, should be submitted to the 
government.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yu. Shevelev, chief of the </F>
Administration of the Timber Industry of Russia's Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food, by I. Kalashnikov; place and date not 
given: "Forest Belt Is a Reliable Bastion"] 
  [Text] Benefactress earth is now in a disastrous 
state. Its fertility is declining catastrophically owing to the 
fact that the application of mineral fertilizers has decreased 
repeatedly. Progressing soil degradation, which is due to the 
increasing wind and water erosion, ferocious dry winds, and sand 
encroaching on arable land, aggravates the agricultural 
situation. As long-term practice shows, green plantings can and 
should protect fields. However, do we sufficiently engage in 
afforestation today? What hinders this? How do immediate 
prospects look? Our correspondent talked about this with Yu. 
Shevelev, chief of the Administration of the Timber Industry of 
Russia's Ministry of Agriculture and Food. 
  In order to better understand the role and significance of 
protective forest plantings--Yuriy Aleksandrovich noted--we 
should first talk, even if in brief, about the natural and 
climatic conditions under which Russia's rural workers have to 
work. These conditions are highly specific and in most regions 
are not quite favorable for agricultural production. 
  Here are the figures of the All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute of Agricultural and Forest Reclamation (VNIALMI). 
About 70 percent of the country's sown areas are located in hot 
and dry or in cold and water-logged zones. Deserts occupy almost 
14 percent of the areas. More than one-half of the areas under 
grain crops are located in the zone of periodic droughts. 
Gullies represent a terrible evil for the plowman. Their total 
area exceeds 6 million hectares. In all, there are 15 to 30 
million hectares of gullied land (according to various 
evaluations). 
  From year to year the agricultural situation does not get 
better. Conversely, it deteriorates, because soil degradation is 
occurring and quite intensively at that. According to 
specialists' estimates, in the last decades approximately 
one-fourth of all the arable land available in Russia, owing to 
wind and water erosion, has lost from 10 to 30 percent of its 
fertility. A catastrophic decrease in humus--more than 81 
million tonnes annually--is observed. It has been estimated 
that, owing to soil erosion, we lose 400,000 to 500,000 hectares 
of arable land annually. Saline soil, swamps, and drift sand 
continue to develop on the most fertile land in the lower 
reaches of the Volga, the Don, and the Kuban. 
  It goes without saying that the picture is depressing. 
Forest 
plantings have always been protectors of fields and crops. To 
put it more simply, only they can save benefactress earth and 
bar the way to destructive dry winds, black storms, encroaching 
sand, and other natural calamities. 
  Apparently, there are quite a few of them--in many regions 
forest belts intersect fields lengthwise and crosswise. However, 
they are obviously insufficient. We have 2.9 million hectares of 
protective plantings, but no less than 14 million are needed. It 
would seem that there is only one conclusion--to reduce this 
gap. Life itself and the disastrous state of land, in which it 
is, demand this. 
  In fact, however, everything is different. For example, last 
year, out of the 132,000 hectares of protective forest plantings 
planned according to initial outlines, trees, shrubs, and other 
plantings have been placed only on 68,000 hectares of the 
allocated areas. If work continues to be carried out at the same 
rates, the required 14 million hectares will not be reached even 
in 100 years. This means that we will not stop the unceasing 
degradation of arable land. Conversely, it will retake vast new 
areas from fields. 
  The reason for such a slow development of protective 
afforestation is known: The crisis situation in the country's 
economy--more simply, the shortage of funds--affects the course 
of work. The funds allocated from the federal budget for these 
purposes are obviously insufficient. Hopes to solve the problem 
with the funds of local budgets are not being realized. First of 
all, because local budgets are still small--they are just being 
formed. However, the problem lies not only in this. Local bodies 
of power often use even the money earmarked for the 
establishment of forest belts for other needs, which, from their 
point of view, are more important. This is due to the 
underestimate and lack of understanding of the importance of 
forest reclamation work. 
  The question arises: What is next? How is tomorrow seen? 
  On assignment from the government the state program for the 
development of agricultural and forest reclamation work in 
Russia is now being prepared. A large group of scientists and 
competent specialists of a number of ministries and departments 
are involved in drawing it up. 
  Undoubtedly, the quite substantial experience in 
afforestation during past years should have been taken into 
consideration. Many, especially people of the older generation, 
remember well with what enthusiasm the planting of forest belts 
was undertaken in localities soon after the end of the war with 
the fascist German invaders. Some years trees and shrubs were 
planted on hundreds of thousands of hectares of arable land, 
gullies, and ravines. During the subsequent period, right up to 
our days, there were both ups and downs in this work. Some years 
afforestation was hardly practised--it was abandoned almost 
completely. 
  Drafting a new important document, we proceed from the fact 
that the agro-industrial complex and the entire national economy 
will derive a vast effect from the forest protective work 
carried out. Specialists estimate that the average annual yield 
of grain on Russia's fields protected by forest belts increases 
by 18 to 23 percent, of industrial crops, by 20 to 26 percent, 
and of fodder crops, by 29 to 41 percent. This promises an 
increase of many million tonnes in the gross output of grain and 
other products. Such a yield increase can be obtained if, to the 
existing almost 3 million hectares occupied by forest and other 
protective plantings, at least as much is added in the next few 
years (in the future their area must be increased to 14 million 
hectares). 
  Such a task is set by the state program for the development 
of agricultural and forest reclamation work. It envisages the 
establishment of a completed system of protective forest 
plantings in the Volga Area, in the central chernozem zone, in 
the North Caucasus, and on big irrigated tracts of land. Similar 
measures are to be carried out in especially dangerous regions 
of the development of water and wind erosion. It will be 
necessary to block the encroachment of sand and to stop the 
depletion of meadows and pastures. 
  What difficulties lie in wait for us during the fulfillment 
of the planned program? The financing of work is problem No 1. 
We proceed from the fact that, since the control of the 
catastrophic soil degradation for the preservation and increase 
in fertility acquires state-wide importance (after all, the 
program is called the state program), the federal budget should 
assume the main concern for its financing, at least at the first 
stage. Of course, this does not mean that funds of local bodies 
of power should not be attracted. No less than 25 to 30 percent 
of the performed work should be paid from local budgets. 
Nevertheless, I repeat, the state budget should be the main 
source. To shift everything to local budgets means to ruin this 
work. There is the danger that funds will be used for other 
purposes--there are sufficient examples of this. 
  Another range of problems is of a juridical and legislative 
nature. Although fundamentals of both land and forest 
legislation already exist, numerous questions regulated by 
nothing arise in practice. The allocation of land for protective 
forest plantings is the most acute. Who assigns them and in what 
order? It seems that it is clear: the owner of land--the 
kolkhoz, the sovkhoz, the cooperative worker, and the farmer. He 
must allocate land, plant trees and shrubs, take care of them, 
and so forth. It is also clear that they do this for themselves, 
for their own needs--forest plantings will protect their crops 
against dry winds, improve the climatic situation, and, 
ultimately, repay them with a yield increase. However, they do 
this, alas, not always. 
  In my opinion, following the example of foreign countries 
(Canada and the United States), we should adopt regional laws 
obliging all land users to carry out the entire set of necessary 
anti-erosion measures on their territory, including the growing 
and maintenance of protective forest plantings. It is also 
necessary to financially interest land users in the survival and 
preservation of forest plantings and to introduce sanctions for 
the nonperformance or low quality of anti-erosion work and the 
loss of perennial plantings. 
  We are also concerned by the purely organizational aspect of 
the matter. That is, how to organize the fulfillment of the 
planned program in practice better and more efficiently. First 
of all, it is necessary to preserve forest reclamation stations 
(there are about 50 of them) existing in localities and not to 
let them die. Numerous nurseries for the growing of seedlings of 
future forest belts are under their authority and many different 
machines for the planting of trees and shrubs and their care are 
concentrated in them. It is also important to preserve forestry 
establishments participating in this work. Unfortunately, in 
order to survive, both forest reclamation stations and forestry 
establishments often withdraw many of their forces for the 
performance of various kinds of commercial operations and change 
their specialization. 
  Of course, this does not exhaust the range of problems 
connected with measures for the control of land degradation. I 
believe that it is necessary to restore previously existing 
forest reclamation services in the system of local bodies of 
agricultural management. A significant restructuring of 
sectorial science and of the personnel training system lies 
ahead. If we do not do this, we will greatly complicate the task 
of afforestation in the country.

  [Text] Despite the lack of money and the serious economic 
difficulties experienced by the agrarian sector, farmers in many 
regions engage in afforestation. True, the rates cannot be 
called shock rates. Nevertheless, the attitude toward protective 
plantings seems quite definite. 
  For example, in the Volga Area and in other regions, where 
gullies cause a great deal of trouble to plowmen, much effort is 
made in the fight against this evil. Thus, in Saratov Oblast on 
gullied land last year trees and shrubs were planted on an area 
of 3,200 hectares, in Orenburg Oblast, 2,750 hectares, and in 
Stavropol Kray, almost 884 hectares. In all, last year 
anti-erosion forest plantings appeared on an area of more than 
11,000 hectares. 
  Under the cover of protective belts pastures and hayfields 
grow better and last longer. Knowing this simple life truth, 
agricultural workers pay attention to the provision of green 
belts on these types of agricultural areas as well. For example, 
in Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast, where the destructive effect 
of dry winds is manifested especially, in 1993 on pastures and 
hayfields forest belts were planted on an area of 17,100 and 
9,300 hectares respectively. In Stavropol and Dagestan the scale 
of such operations is much more modest--1,240 and 1,300 
hectares. Nevertheless, it is good that in our difficult times 
people engage in this. 
  Areas of field protective plantings are expanding, although 
slowly. Last year more than 1,000 hectares of new forest belts 
were established in Rostov Oblast, 920 in Voronezh Oblast, 990 
in Orenburg Oblast, 800 in Saratov Oblast, and 600 in Kalmykia. 
In all, soil protective plantings were placed on an area of 
29,000 hectares. In 1993 the total area of forest belts on 
hayfields and pastures increased by 38,000 hectares.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ivanov: "The President Has Come to the </F>
Defense of Hired Labor. The Authorities Are Working on the 
Timely Payment of Wages"] 
  [Text] For the first time, the state has proclaimed 
its intention strictly to control the timeliness of the payment 
of wages at all enterprises, including private. This was done 
through Boris Yeltsin's edict "On Penalties for Violations of 
the Labor Rights of Citizens," of which the official 
distribution began yesterday. However, the real significance of 
the edict is political rather than economic. 
  The main thrust of the edict is quite simple: The president 
instructs the procuracy to step up the oversight of compliance 
with the legislation of the Russian Federation on labor and 
collective contracts and agreements by enterprises, offices, and 
organizations regardless of the form of ownership and 
departmental affiliation, "paying special attention to the 
prevention of instances of delays in the payment of wages." 
Therefore, the state has officially proclaimed for the first 
time its intention strictly to control the timeliness of the 
payment of wages at enterprises with all forms of ownership. 
  Technically, such steps by the authorities may have certain 
significance for entrepreneurs. Since the right of the employees 
to receive wages at the times specified in advance is mainly set 
forth in collective contracts, employers at both state and 
private enterprises may be accused of violating these contracts 
in the event that the payments are delayed. Pursuant to the law 
"On Collective Contracts and Agreements," which was passed in 
March 1992, individuals representing the employer who are guilty 
of violating and failing to honor obligations under collective 
contracts shall be liable to fines in an amount of up to 100 
times the size of the minimum wage assessed by courts. However, 
no actual stricter control by the authorities should be expected 
in this sphere, given the traditional high case loads of the 
Russian procuracy and courts, as well as the purely technical 
difficulties involved in the continuous monitoring of a large 
number of enterprises. Nonetheless, in individual cases 
enterprises may, of course, run into problems. For example, a 
technical delay in financing for many city enterprises may occur 
in conjunction with the redistribution of the budgetary accounts 
of the city among authorized banks by a recent decree of the 
government of Moscow. In view of friction between the federal 
authorities and those of Moscow, this may very well be used as a 
pretext to accuse these enterprises of delaying the payment of 
wages. 
  Under the specific Russian conditions, the significance of 
the edict on the whole is political rather than economic. In 
this manner, the authorities have simply pointed up yet again 
their intention to win the broadest possible support from the 
population, having selected the problem of delays in the payment 
of wages precisely because it is virtually the easiest to 
understand for Russian citizens from among all other economic 
problems. It is quite safe to say that the new edict is one of 
the steps calculated to make popular a new slogan of the 
authorities--the idea of reinforcing the statehood of Russia: A 
quite significant proportion of the population still views the 
state primarily as the direct or indirect employer and guarantor 
of incomes. This is not the least important reason why the 
government has demonstratively dissociated itself from the 
practice of delaying the payment of wages to the employees of 
units financed from the budget as a peculiar method of financial 
stabilization. It is noteworthy that precisely on the eve of the 
signing of the edict, the presidium of the government ultimately 
approved a draft of the programmatic decree "On the Standing of 
the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development in 1994." 
The decision to fully pay the debt of the budget to enterprises 
in the sphere financed from the budget in March 1994 is one of 
the focal points of the decree. This is quite a serious step, 
given that according to some estimates, such debt comes to 1.9 
trillion rubles, and may only be eliminated within a short 
period of time through additional emission.

<F P=106> [Report from the Information Service of the Federal </F>
Employment Service under the rubric "Labor Market": "There Are 
Already About a Million Unemployed: 633,000 People Receive 
Benefits"] 
  [Text] As of 1 March 1994, the State Employment Service had 
registered 1.2665 million citizens not engaged in labor 
activity, including 989,500 unemployed persons. During February 
the number of citizens not working increased by 101,900 people 
as compared to the previous month, while the corresponding 
figure for unemployed was 95,700 people. 
  Citizens released from enterprises, organizations, and 
institutions make up 25.8 percent of the total number of 
nonworking people. 
  In February 1994, the State Employment Service offered 
62,800 
Russian residents work. Work was offered to 24 percent of the 
job-seekers within 10 days of the moment they applied to the 
employment service. Unemployed citizens constitute 67 percent of 
those who were placed in jobs. 
  In February 1994, 16,500 Russian residents took part in paid 
public works, and that is 2.8 times more than in the same period 
in 1993. 
  In February 1994, the State Employment Service offered 
62,600 
citizens the opportunity to acquire a new occupation 
(specialization); that is 2.2 times more than in February last 
year. 
  In February 1994, 9,000 unemployed people had the right to 
go 
on pension ahead of schedule. 
  As of 1 March 1994, the State Employment Service had 
information on 274,900 job vacancies; of those 83 percent were 
for ordinary workers and 17 percent were for white-collar 
workers. The number of job vacancies declined by 2.8 percent 
during February 1994. 
  Unemployment benefits were paid to 633,000 citizens in 
February 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by TRUD political commentator Vitaliy Golovachev: </F>
"The Bomb for Pensioners--the `Secret' Concept of the Ministry 
of Social Security, the Ministry of Labor, and the Pension Fund"] 
  [Text] I tried for 3 days to obtain this document. Three 
deputy ministers and a dozen officials of a little lower rank 
had worked it out, but I was unable to obtain the 20 or 30 pages 
of typewritten text. Most surprising of all was the fact that 
this does not concern the latest weapon, where secrecy would 
have been entirely appropriate, but just..."A Concept for 
Reforming the Pension System in the Russian Federation." As far 
as I know, the document bore no security classification, but the 
high ministry officials, as if they were partisans being 
interrogated, kept the secret paper to themselves, fearing to 
let it out of their hands. 
  L. Bezlepkina, the first deputy minister of social security, 
adopted an inflexible position right away: 
  "The `Concept' is still being worked on, in `raw form,' so 
to 
speak, and it will be refined and improved. For this reason, I 
cannot give you the text. When the government approves the 
`Concept,' then please..." 
  "But after all, Lyudmila Fedorovna, journalists were invited 
to the collegium of the Ministry of Social Security where this 
`Concept' was being discussed. Does this mean we can hear the 
discussion but not read the document?" 
  "Yes, it was possible to listen, but not to read..." 
  Yu. Lyublin, the deputy chairman of the Pension Fund, also 
categorically refused my request. 
  Deputy Minister of Labor V. Yanvarev showed the ill-fated 
text in his hands from a distance, rapidly turning the pages, 
but he gave a decisive "no" to my request to read it. 
  "First of all, this is official material," Yanvarev told me. 
"Secondly, we are making extensive changes in it at the Ministry 
of Labor now. Thirdly, this is not our material at all, and 
fourthly, we do not agree with a great deal here..." 
  Yanvarev laid the typewritten pages on his desk and 
carefully 
covered them with other papers--it does not matter that I have 
good vision and I could read something... 
  Just what kind of a secret are the high ministry officials 
guarding from a journalist, and hence from readers--from 
Russians? What is the secret "bomb" hidden in these papers, 
which no outsider can be allowed to even come close to? 
Ultimately, matters related to pensions concern tens of millions 
of citizens, and even working documents and the course of the 
discussions themselves are of great interest to all citizens. 
Previously, any decisions affecting the people were prepared in 
secret, behind double doors and thick walls. Perhaps the 
ministry officials of today long for those days? 
  However, I obtained the "supersecret" document anyway, 
though 
illegally, and I gave my word that I would not say who passed it 
to me. And after reading the concept, I surmised why Yanvarev, 
Bezlepkina, Lyublin, and the other officials charged with 
looking after the people's welfare refused so persistently to 
give out this material. There are really "bombs" in it! 
  Here is one of them relating to pension age. At the 
beginning 
of this section of the "Concept," it is correctly pointed out 
that the rise in unemployment in the transition to a market 
economy requires that pension age be lowered so that the older 
groups vacate the work places for younger employees. In 
emphasizing this correct thesis, the "Concept" authors 
(employees of the Ministry of Social Security, Ministry of 
Labor, the Pension Fund, and others) put the principal accent on 
another idea--the need to increase the age at which employees 
have the right to be pensioned. 
  These are the arguments here: the population is getting 
older 
and the proportion of pensioners is increasing, thereby 
increasing the "load" on those who are working. We have less 
than two workers for each pensioner at present. For this reason, 
they say, it is very difficult to provide for an adequate level 
of pensions for those who really cannot work. 
  Hence the conclusion: subsequently, to the extent that the 
economy and the labor market is stabilized, we can shift to a 
higher pension age, first increasing it by 2 to 3 years, and 
later on setting 65 years for men and 60 for women. At the same 
time, it is proposed that the principle of "flexible" age, that 
is, the opportunity to receive an early pension of a lesser 
amount, be adopted. 
  The section ends like this: "According to preliminary 
estimates, taking demographic forecasts into account (that is, 
the increase in pension age--V.G.), it may be implemented after 
the year 2000. However, the preparation for this step should be 
begun now." But why "now?" Will tomorrow really be too late? 
  I would like to ask the authors of this version of the 
"Concept" whether they know the average life expectancy in 
Russia now. According to preliminary estimates, it is less than 
60 for men (it was 64 in 1990). In other words, the life 
expectancy of representatives of "the stronger sex" is declining 
rapidly. And this is obvious from the obituary notices without 
scientific research: they often die at 56, 54, or 58... The 
Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics] points out that the 
mortality rate of citizens of working age is increasing at a 
faster rate. Today 30 percent of those who have died did not 
reach pension age. And under these conditions, raising the 
question of increasing pension age in the not-too-distant future 
(the year 2000 is 5 years away) is intolerable and immoral. Even 
according to the most optimistic forecasts, our economy will 
have to deal with a large number of problems in the next 5 to 10 
years. There are no grounds to assume that life expectancy will 
increase. And under these conditions, raising the pension age is 
not simply wrong, it can lead to serious social conflicts. 
  Well, don't our "protectors of the people's interests" 
understand this? I think they understand; otherwise, they would 
not have made this document so "secret." But why did they do it 
if they understand this? In order to save some crumbs for a 
future budget at the cost of those who die before reaching 
pension age? You cannot say this is a "humane" approach. I was 
very ashamed to read this "Concept." Incidentally, it was 
obviously not by chance that they "forgot" to involve 
specialists from the FITUR [Russian Federation of Independent 
trade Unions] in the work. In the meantime, I have a 
counter-question: why are the trade unions themselves sleeping? 
  At the Ministry of Social Security collegium where they 
discussed the document, officials from the Ministry of Labor 
sharply criticized many provisions of the "Concept." It is now 
being reworked. Will the prosposals to increase the pension age 
remain in the new version? Deputy Minister of Labor V. Yanvarev, 
who would not give me the notorious document, chose his words 
carefully, saying that in his opinion, "there are no grounds to 
raise the question of revising the pension age in the near 
future." But this is the opinion of just one deputy minister. 
Let us see what appears in the second version. Incidentally, 
Yanvarev promised to send this new document to the editorial 
staff. Unless he has second thoughts, of course.

<F P=106> [Article by Tax Police Department Director Sergey Almazov: </F>
"As You Get Rich, Look Around at the Law"] 
  [Text] Relatively recently, a new structure appeared 
in the system of organs of executive power, the Russian 
Federation Tax Police Department. The department's director, 
Sergey Almazov, talks about how it came to be and the problems 
connected with this phase. 
  In creating the tax police, the experience of many foreign 
countries, where analogous services have existed for a long time 
and have proven their necessity by the results of their work, 
was taken into account. 
  The appearance of an analogous service here is neither a 
tribute to fashion nor a copying of Western models. With the 
appearance of free enterprise in Russia, the old system of 
taxation proved incapable of ensuring the stable fulfillment of 
the state budget. Therefore, in 1991, a new structure was 
created, the State Tax Service (GNS). Life has shown, however, 
that this mechanism for implementing tax legislation requires 
strengthening. The problem is that the Russian market has 
attracted not only law-abiding citizens. It has been inundated 
by criminal capital, and an entire shadow business industry has 
begun to form. Not only are they beyond the reach of taxation; 
this capital nourishes the criminal world and fans inflationary 
processes. 
  For the tax inspector (these are civilians, most of them 
women, moreover), incursion into this sphere has become a risky 
and frequently dangerous affair. After all, even at the office 
of some seemingly respectable firm, an armed guard might 
unceremoniously escort them out. 
  The only way to force people to respect the law and to 
ensure 
its unswerving implementation by all is by relying on a special 
force structure that possesses the authority of a law-keeping 
organ. Such a service in the tax system was in fact created by 
the Russian president's edict of 18 March 1992. The service's 
official title is "Chief Administration for Tax Investigations 
Under the State Tax Service of the Russian Federation." As of 
July 1993, the lawful heir to the Main Administration for Tax 
Investigations became the Tax Police Department. 
  Last year alone, we, in conjunction with the GNS, uncovered 
and cut off more than 32,000 violations of tax legislation. 
Brought to light were more than 1000 enterprises and 
organizations that were not registered with the state tax 
inspectorates. Naturally, they were not contemplating paying 
taxes. 
  As a rule, the tax police are involved in the sphere of 
criminal business, deals connected with concealing income in 
major and grand proportions. That is, if I can express myself 
this way, we are talking about the below-water part of the 
iceberg. Again in 1993, 617 criminal cases were opened. By the 
end of January of this year, about 60 of them had already been 
heard by the courts and punishment imposed on the guilty. 
  By law, we are obligated to ensure the safety of the 
activities of state tax inspectorates and to protect their 
associates from illegal infringements during the execution of 
their official duties. In the past year in Russia, 128 instances 
of violent and other illegal actions against associates of the 
tax organs were recorded. There have been incidents of arson and 
shootings at buildings in which tax inspectorates are located. 
  Physical protection subdivisions of the tax police have been 
created in order to resolve this problem in the structure of 
federal organs. These also provide security for those same 
buildings of the tax inspectorates. 
  In the United States, the tax inspection service has been 
given authority that would amaze some of our champions of human 
rights. After all, those suspected of concealing income are open 
to secret surveillance, wiretapping, and the opening and 
inspection of correspondence. In the event of nonpayment of 
taxes here, we can seize the bank account of the defaulter, 
confiscate an automobile or other private property, shut down an 
enterprise, and deprive the representative of a free profession 
of his private practice. When necessary, the services of paid 
informants are used, and colleagues are being introduced into 
structures with criminal capital. 
  Every year, the American tax inspection services create 
hundreds of dummy corporations through which they are able to 
uncover concealed forms of business. And all this is provided 
for by law. 
  The ordinary American would rather sleep peacefully than 
deal 
with the tax organs. Nor is it wise to: just for incorrectly 
filling out a declaration one is subject to a fine of up to 
$1000, and intentional reduction of income is punishable by a 
fine of $5000 or a prison term of up to five years. Moreover, 
the principle of the presumption of innocence seems not to 
exist: the tax inspector does not have to prove the guilt of the 
suspect. According to U.S. laws, the taxpayer himself is obliged 
upon request by the tax organs to submit documents proving the 
legality of the source of his income. 
  In Russia as yet there are quite a few people among whom a 
different psychology reigns: get rich quick. Even seemingly very 
proper people who in the past were not completely certain of 
tomorrow are rushing to grab everything they can today and often 
act without looking around at the law. By no means am I inclined 
to see a potential criminal in everyone; moreover I agree that 
our tax legislation is not yet complete. However, if we really 
do want to make the transition to a rule-of-law state, effective 
laws must be implemented rigorously. 
  In the last year, the additional sums resulting from audits 
carried out in conjunction with the GNS totaled about R600 
billion, more than $120 million, and millions of German marks, 
French francs, and other currencies. 
  Unfortunately, manifesting themselves more and more 
distinctly in society today are interests whose very existence 
represents a serious threat to the tax police. Attempts are 
being made to inculcate in public consciousness an image of the 
tax police as yet another structure of force, supposedly capable 
of inhibiting the formation in Russia of a class of property 
owners, the assertion of the spirit of free enterprise, and the 
speedy rise, on this basis, of the Russian economy. For this 
reason, it represents an extra, unnecessary link. 
  I assure you, though, it is unnecessary only for those who, 
while declaring their devotion to the principles of free 
enterprise and a rule-of-law state, are in fact employing unjust 
means for enrichment, including concealment of income from 
taxation. 
  Many representatives of business and entrepreneurial circles 
who are concerned not only about their own pocket but about 
Russia's rebirth note with alarm that billions are draining away 
abroad today and settling in foreign bank accounts.

<F P=106> [Interview with tax police Colonel Vladimir Avdiyskiy, Chief </F>
of the Control-Audit Administration of the Department of the Tax 
Police of the Russian Federation, by Sergey Ivanov; place and 
date not given: "Do Not Forget To Declare Your Incomes. Citizens 
of Russia Will Begin To Be Checked for Honesty"] 
  [Text] Another item has been added to the spring 
concerns of our compatriots--by 1 April 1994, according to the 
law, it is necessary to submit a declaration of income to the 
local tax inspectorate. Many people are still regarding this 
measure as extraordinary. Therefore, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA asked 
Tax Police Colonel Vladimir Avdiyskiy, chief of the 
Control-Audit Administration of the Department of the Tax Police 
of the Russian Federation, to provide several 
clarifications. 
  [Avdiyskiy] There is nothing extraordinary here. Moreover, 
declaring income began back in 1993. New mechanisms for 
implementing Russian tax legislation are being put to work in a 
planned way. What is now new to Russians has long been 
commonplace in countries with a developed market economy. For 
instance, for citizens of the United States, declaring incomes 
is nothing more than an episode in their intense, event-filled 
life. 
  [Ivanov] But Russia is not America. We have many people who 
consider it their duty to evade the law, to find loopholes in it. 
  [Avdiyskiy] So making citizens of Russia declare their 
incomes will contribute to closing up these loopholes. This is 
being done in keeping with the law of the Russian Federation "On 
Individual Income Tax" of 7 December 1991. The essence of the 
problem is this. In the system of market relations the 
possibilities for Russian citizens to acquire income have 
increased sharply. Today it is not prohibited to combine jobs, 
engage in free entrepreneurship, or obtain dividends by 
investing money in one enterprise or another. Therefore, it was 
decided to switch to a practice of taxing the aggregate annual 
income. The point of the declaration is extremely simple: each 
year the taxpayer must report his income to the state and, 
taking the amount into account, make the corresponding payments 
into the budget. 
  [Ivanov] Does this pertain to all or only to certain 
categories of citizens? 
  [Avdiyskiy] The declaration is mandatory for those whose 
aggregate taxable income during 1993 exceeded 3 million rubles 
[R]. True, there are exceptions here. For example, citizens 
whose incomes involve only their main job are released from 
filing tax declarations even if their aggregate annual income 
has exceeded R3 million. But citizens registered as 
entrepreneurs must submit a declaration regardless of the amount 
of income they received. All the fine points and details that 
interest the taxpayers can be explained at the local state tax 
inspectorates. 
  As for the tax police, as a law enforcement organ, it mainly 
works with those who conceal from taxation incomes in large and 
especially large amounts. 
  [Ivanov] Incidentally, what is the difference between 
"large" 
and "especially large"? 
  [Avdiyskiy] According to criminal legislation in effect 
(Article 162-2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), 
concealing especially large amounts is when there is concealment 
of income or other objects of taxation on which the tax exceeds 
1,000 (one thousand) times the minimum wage. And large amounts 
of concealment are when this indicator exceeds 50 (fifty) times 
the minimum wage. 
  It is no longer billions but even trillions of rubles that 
bypass the state treasury. In 1993, for example, according to 
the budget, the income should have been R23 trillion-R25 
trillion, but it actually amounted to R17 trillion. You can 
consider that whatever was due to the state settled out into 
private pockets. And a very great deal depends on this--whether 
or not wages will be paid promptly to workers of the state 
budget-financed sphere, stipends to disabled persons, pensions 
for elderly people, stipends for students, whether or not the 
government will be able to mobilize financial resources for 
fighting inflation, crisis phenomena in the economy, and so 
forth. Looking at the large picture, we are speaking about the 
very fate of the reforms that have been started and economic and 
social stability in society. 
  And therefore, ensuring unwavering observance of tax 
legislation is among the priority tasks. 
  Declaring income will be, if you will, a kind of test of 
honesty of many thousands of Russians and will give tax organs 
additional opportunities to figure out who is who. For today, in 
addition to honest entrepreneurs, there are many who steal 
billions, build villas or even entire palaces for themselves, 
buy up real estate, and submit to the tax inspector an official 
notice that they received wages corresponding to the wages of a 
teacher or a nurse. Such individuals will undoubtedly have to 
deal with the tax police, and they will have to give 
explanations of the origin of their income and make 
reimbursement to the state for damages caused, counting fines, 
and possibly they will also be held responsible in keeping with 
Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. 
  [Ivanov] And how much can they be fined for such 
machinations? 
  [Avdiyskiy] Concealment of large amounts is punishable by a 
fine in an amount of up to 350 times the minimum wage. And 
concealment of especially large amounts is punishable by 
incarceration for a period of up to five years with or without 
confiscation of property or a fine in the amount of from 300 to 
500 times the minimum wage. 
  [Ivanov] Harsh. But what if, say, I have not filled out the 
tax declaration by 1 April? 
  [Avdiyskiy] That option, as they say, will cost more. If you 
fail to submit a declaration or submit it late, you can be fined 
10 percent of the amount due for payment. Moreover, for each day 
of delay in paying the income tax there was a penalty of 0.3 
percent last year, and this year it will be 0.7 percent. Plus 
there is the administrative fine. 
  In general here one should mention Article 163 of the 
Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. It says: "Failure to 
appear at the organs of the State Tax Service to submit 
explanations or refusal to submit explanations concerning 
sources of income (profit) and their actual amount, and also 
failure to submit documents and other information concerning the 
activity of the economic entity at the request of the State Tax 
Service shall be punished by a fine in an amount of from 100 to 
150 times the minimum wage, set by legislation." 
  [Ivanov] Declaration of income, like any report, presupposes 
documentary confirmation of expenditures and incomes. What does 
the taxpayer need for this? 
  [Avdiyskiy] This is an extremely significant point. A waiter 
in the United States, for example, must even indicate the total 
tips he has received. Receipts, credit slips that have gone 
through the bank, personal checks, and other documents are saved 
like treasures there. An American will never throw away a check 
on which the amount paid for an apartment, summer house, or 
motor vehicle is registered, documents confirming the right to 
inherit property, the receipt of credit, etc. The Russian 
taxpayer has to get used to this too. It is necessary not only 
to document your income but also the sums of taxes paid 
throughout the year. For this, whether you like it or not, you 
have to be your own bookkeeper--keep track of your receipts and 
large expenditures, since "forgetfulness" is no excuse when 
determining liability for concealing income. 
  [Ivanov] Why is the deadline set at 1 April and not, say, 1 
March? 
  [Avdiyskiy] The law gives the taxpayer three months to 
gather 
the necessary documents and determine how much income has been 
received during the year. Although there is no single criterion 
here. Different deadlines have been set in other countries. The 
American taxpayer, for example, must submit a tax declaration by 
15 April of the following year. In Sweden the deadline for 
submitting it is 15 February. 
  [Ivanov] And will the tax organs be able to handle the 
avalanche of declarations? Even without this, one has to stand 
in line for hours waiting for a tax inspector. 
  [Avdiyskiy] There is a problem here, and an extremely 
serious 
one. The State Tax Service and we, the Tax Police, are 
experiencing a critical need for a modern computer base, a 
unified information system that will encompass the whole country. 
  [Ivanov] Do you not see a danger that a good cause could be 
discredited by the willfulness of unscrupulous tax bureaucrats? 
  [Avdiyskiy] If such cases occur, the taxpayer will always 
have the right to appeal incorrect actions on the part of the 
tax organ worker.

<F P=106> [Erik Kotlyar report on news conference given by V.F. Yerin, </F>
minister of internal affairs; place and date not given: "The 
Growth of Crime Can Be Stopped If All Forces in Society Get 
Involved in Fighting It, Believes V.F. Yerin, Minister of 
Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] The minister informed journalists about this at a 
news conference, adding that a reduction in the rate of growth 
of crime last year was successfully achieved through collective 
efforts, although the exceptional role of the functionaries of 
the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organization and the 
militia cannot be diminished. In essence, they are waging, in 
peacetime, a real war on the escalation of violations of the law 
which is invisible to the eye of a common citizen. 
  At present, the signs of crime can be seen in the increased 
number of serious crimes: murder, robbery, and criminal 
violations in the economic area. All of this is very alarming. 
The minister thinks that being better informed about the actions 
of the militia is necessary so that the faith of the people of 
Russia in the possibility of defeating the criminal underworld 
will be reinforced. To this end, law enforcement organs must 
strengthen contacts with the journalist corps. The examples 
given suggest that objective publications that are beneficial 
immediately receive practical evaluation through the actions of 
MVD organs. On the contrary, unconscientious pen-pushers not 
only misinform the mass reader in so-called "made-to-order" 
pieces but also clearly play into the hands of those who are on 
the wrong side of the law. Until recently the authors got away 
with such information, whereas now, in an aggravated situation 
bordering on an emergency in terms of tension, special attention 
will be paid to such opuses. 
  A report to the people of Russia that was published in the 
press is an example of open information on the operations of the 
internal affairs organs. In the opinion of V. Yerin, this is the 
continuation of a tradition started by V. Bakatin in his time. 
The excessive atmosphere of secrecy in which the MVD 
organization was continuously shrouded is alien in spirit to a 
genuine democracy. 
  The minister sees hopeful prospects for rooting out the 
criminal flaws of our reality in the provisions of the Federal 
Program for Crime Control in 1994-1995. As V. Yerin admits, he 
is not particularly fond of directive documents; in solving 
practical tasks, he sees the benefit of primarily practical 
actions. However, the advantage of the newly developed program, 
and its specific distinction from related directives, edicts, 
and decrees, is that it is based on a set of specific endeavors 
which are truly capable of bringing an end to the exuberant 
bloom of evil anomalies in the life of our society. 
  First of all, the financial support program is realistic. 
All 
ministries and departments participated in its development, and 
each of them is financially responsible for a portion. The state 
budget accounts for just about 2 trillion rubles [R], which did 
not make the Ministry of Finance tremble. In particular, the 
program comprehensively embraces measures to eliminate the 
obstacles into which the organs applying the law usually run. 
Consider, for example, illegal trafficking in weapons. The 
program requires that functionaries of the MVD organs and 
militia employees verify in detail the "biography" of each 
firearm from the fitter's bench where it was made to the 
criminal shot fired. Since the process of inquest and subsequent 
investigation is on occasion incomplete because of the absence 
of exhaustive data on the instance of violation of law, the 
Federal Program calls for creating specialized bureaus for 
debriefing people who for various reasons are not capable of 
making an important report on their own. Of course, the program 
pays much attention to the methods for combating corruption and 
organized crime. However, in this instance everything will 
depend on laws which deputies at various levels will pass soon 
or will not pass for a long time to come. 
  In the words of the minister, it is also important that the 
program takes into account social protection for marginal 
populations--the cadre reserve of career criminals. The program 
also has a point on support for the victims of criminal actions. 
Notably, communications between the militia and the population 
on the principle of a fire alarm call will finally be put in 
order. In general, this means restoring justice: After all, we 
remember well how prompt the response of the 02 service was in 
recent times.... It is a pity that we again have to restore 
things that operated without fail in the past. The minister 
asked journalists to refrain from excessive emotions--the MVD is 
flexing and will flex its muscles in the future, although this 
is not to say that these muscles can be used contrary to the 
law. The MVD is first of all an organ applying the law whose 
actions are strictly based on upholding the law. 
  There are many skilled and well-versed criminal 
investigators 
within the organization of the MVD, although, in the words of V. 
Yerin, there has been a certain slump in their work. The young 
directorates for combating organized crime drew praise from the 
minister, whereas the former Department for Combating Theft of 
Socialist Property, which is currently an organ for combating 
economic crime, was rebuked for being slow to adjust to the new 
situation. 
  A question by a correspondent from Baku concerning 
cooperation between the Russian Federation MVD and the law 
enforcement organs of nearby foreign countries drew a 
categorical response from V. Yerin: Foreigners not protected by 
diplomatic immunity incur criminal liability under the laws of 
Russia, especially when such violations of the law as illegal 
importation of drugs to the territory of Russia are committed. 
It appeared that the man from Baku took offense, although he 
should be taking offense at his countrymen who have turned the 
markets of Moscow into a drug market! 
  The minister answered a question by the leader of the Pamyat 
Society, D. Vasilyev, on the attitude of the MVD toward various 
political groups: If it occurs to Pamyat or another entity of 
any political hue to create their own armed units, the MVD will 
immediately use all lawful sanctions against them. At the same 
time, V. Yerin agreed that D. Vasilyev's remark about the 
inadequate cultural standard of the actions and professional 
training of individual militia functionaries was quite 
legitimate. One would think that D. Vasilyev's well-meaning wish 
that the guardians of the law would behave better will be taken 
under advisement. In response to a question put by our 
newspaper--is it not high time to begin patrolling the 
streets?--the minister stated that he is prepared to take the 
harshest criticism but, in his opinion, young soldiers who have 
not seen action cannot be placed in areas where bullets fly. 
Apparently, this is a more suitable role for pedestrians, who 
have every right to defend themselves.... Some information media 
were reprimanded for exaggerating the role of the "Russian 
mafia" abroad. Information on opening up a direct channel for 
police communication between Russia and Germany sounded 
sensational. 
  In his concluding remarks V. Yerin praised Mayor of Moscow 
Yu. Luzhkov for the proper interpretation of the tasks of the 
militia and the allocation of official housing and monetary and 
technical resources for the city militia. 
  Well, it is possible that new times will begin in Russia, if 
everything that was mentioned at the press conference is indeed 
implemented.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ostankino General Director A. Yakovlev, by </F>
GOLOS correspondent A. Nadzharov: "Ostankino Counting Money"] 
  [Text] Three months ago, as he was coming to 
television, Aleksandr Yakovlev heard many worrisome reports 
about mercenary crimes at Ostankino. 
  [GOLOS] Were they confirmed, Aleksandr Nikolaevich? 
  [Yakovlev] Not entirely. For instance, one of the cameramen, 
or so I had been told, was not averse to accepting a 
"consideration" for showing the thoughtful face of a businessman 
who had placed a "private order" during, say, a hockey match. 
  [GOLOS] Possibly. Only this is completely unpunishable, in 
my 
opinion. 
  [Yakovlev] Correct. However, there is also the concept of 
one's reputation. And when it develops in a certain manner it 
necessarily excludes the possibility of that kind of operator 
continuing to work in any serious institution. 
  [GOLOS] Did you discover any more serious violations, 
though? 
  [Yakovlev] I didn't. At my request, however, the president 
has ordered his administration's control commission to arrange a 
special investigation. It has just completed its work and 
apparently has not uncovered any truly serious crimes. It is 
true, there are some suspicions concerning the economic 
activities of Ostankino's former deputy general director, 
Bandura, but it is still too soon to draw any conclusions: we 
recently submitted the documents that were gathered to the court 
for them to sort out. 
  [GOLOS] By the way, about criminal activity. Lately rumors 
have been going around about the president's alleged ill health 
or about another putsch being readied. During Yeltsin's 
vacation, your channel broadcast an alarming report from one of 
the new agencies about Chernomyrdin's sudden Sunday visit to 
Sochi and about the telephones being out of order at the White 
House. 
  [Yakovlev] That's all nonsense, and it was pointless to put 
out an unverified report. Chernomyrdin did fly to see the 
president, but not on Sunday or on Monday, and not on the 
subject of any "coup being readied," but to settle on some 
corrections to the budget, and certainly not because of how 
Yeltsin was feeling. I should have his health. 
  [GOLOS] So, it's like the joke about the man who didn't win 
a 
car but lost, not the lottery but solitaire, and not a car but a 
hundred rubles? 
  [Yakovlev] Something like that. Only I think someone is 
organizing these campaigns regularly. Previously, a special 
subdivision of Kryuchkov's KGB did this kind of thing. He's gone 
now, but his nasty business seems to have survived. 
  [GOLOS] To be honest, I was somewhat uncomfortable about 
talking with Aleksandr Nikolaevich about any criminal activity. 
Especially since in the final analysis none of us is all that 
interested in the TV "kitchen." What lacks does Ostankino's 
director see in the activities of state channel No. 1, and how 
does he plan to overcome them? 
  [Yakovlev] I will say straight away that we are going to be 
airing the multi-series Mexican melodramas. No matter how much I 
dislike them, they rate very high for viewer interest. 
  [GOLOS] But what about our own, Russian cinema? After all, 
there are so many films made in recent years that the viewer has 
never seen! 
  [Yakovlev] I agree, only the filmmakers are demanding 15 
million rubles [R] for each showing, and where is that kind of 
money to be got if the state is only paying for 30 percent of 
the state channel's work? After all, besides paying for the 
showing, we also have to pay the Communications Ministry R35 
million per signal hour. No advertising money is enough here. In 
short, we and the film people have to sit down and count the 
money. Count it together. 
  [GOLOS] From time to time certain shows disappear from the 
airwaves. Individual leaders drop out of sight. By what criteria 
do you determine their right to air? 
  [Yakovlev] Generally speaking, I'm not involved in that. 
There are editorial offices and television associations, and 
what you're talking about is in their hands. So that I am not 
reckoned as a censor or benevolent granddad in television. I 
will say, however, that if I were one of the editorial 
directors, I would simply fire those journalists who are 
clarifying their relations in the collective through the press. 
I'm an old newspaper man myself. I started out on the district 
paper, and I have no memory, say, of our newspaper reporters 
ever complaining about their bosses on "Sportloto." 
  [GOLOS] Would you please say a few words about Ostankino's 
new TV shows? 
  [Yakovlev] There are lots of them. We are trying to 
emphasize 
the information and the nearly vanished current affairs 
programs. Meanwhile, some leaders are mad at me because there's 
no room for moralizing within the framework for putting out the 
news. And it's right that they don't. Give the viewer the facts; 
he'll draw his own conclusions. Which, actually, by no means 
excludes intelligent analysis or expert commentary. This is a 
neglected area among us, unfortunately. After all, the childish 
kick given in passing to the president, who, in the opinion of 
the story's young author, supposedly missed or overlooked 
something, cannot be considered analysis. By the way, about the 
young. It was in their milieu--I have in mind MGU (Moscow State 
University)--that a pretty good idea was born for a series of 
broadcasts on "hot topics." Ostankino is starting to prepare 
another series on the provincial cities on which, as the saying 
goes, Russia stands. 
  [GOLOS] But what are your personal television plans, 
Aleksandr Nikolaevich? 
  [Yakovlev] I will leave Ostankino after a while. By the 
president's edict I, speaking generally, have been appointed 
chairman of Gosteleradio (State Television and Radio). Channel 
No. 1 is temporary. 
  This business of holding more than one job will come to an 
end, and, along with my colleagues, I will be involved in 
issuing broadcast licenses, which will go, I am certain, to the 
best programs, films, directors, and journalists.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Arifdzhanov: "The Government </F>
Proposes--the National Economy Disposes; Energy: All against 
One: The General Campaign of the Branches against the 
Joint-Stock Company of the Russian Power Industry Is at a 
Standstill for the Time Being"] 
  [Text] When domestic affairs are not running very smoothly, 
war is necessary as an extreme measure to pull out of the 
situation. The image of the foreign enemy, whether it is a 
person of Caucasian nationality, American thrice-cursed 
imperialism, or the Afghan mujahidin wandering from place to 
place in an area that is rather remote from the average Russian 
zone, temporarily unites society and distracts from local 
disorders. 
  It is the same with economic battles. The VPK [military 
industrial complex] can hardly brag about important successes. 
Affairs in the fuel and energy complex are far from excellent. 
Metallurgists and machine builders are having difficulties. 
After uniting, Russian industrialists have mounted a campaign 
against the joint-stock company Unified Energy System of Russia 
[YeES]. 
  February was a time of especially massive attacks. First 
Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets, a VPK favorite, demanded the 
removal of the president of YeES, and Minister of Fuel and 
Energy Shafranik proposed changing the structure of the 
joint-stock company, dividing it into two--the producers of 
energy and its suppliers to consumers--and Minister of Labor 
Melikyan cited the average wage of power engineers of 130,000 
rubles [R], which exceeds that in other industries. 
  But the reason for the beginning of combat operations was 
the 
steady increase in rates for electric power. The reason, 
incidentally, is rather well-thought out. It is not the power 
engineers who are increasing the rates. The Yeltsin edict "On 
the Liberalization of Prices" of 1 November 1991 states clearly 
that prices were being dropped for products of all branches 
except electricity. The state retained the right to regulate 
rates in this branch. In practice, 75 regional and one federal 
power commission give the "OK" for any change in rates for 
electric power. 
  At the same time, the cost of a kilowatt is really 
increasing. The power industry itself is in a difficult 
financial position. Consumers owe it R3.2 trillion. The effort 
to eliminate the joint-stock company is understandable: There is 
a joint-stock company, it is necessary to pay off debts, and if 
there is no company, of course, there also are no debts. 
  Price formation is a special and sore subject. Last year, 
coal prices increased by a factor of 14, gas--by a factor of 23, 
and fuel oil--by a factor of four. For this reason also the cost 
of electric power increased by a factor of 6.5. But even with 
this, our rate amounts to only 20-30 percent of the level of 
most developed countries. In the United States, for example, the 
rate for industry is about 5 cents per kilowatt hour, for the 
population--8 cents. The Russian price of electricity for 
industry vacillates from 1 to 2.5 cents, and for the population 
on average approximately 0.3 cents. Thus, Russian rates are 
lower than world rates by a factor of three to four. And, very 
likely, it is not the fault of the power industry that the 
prices for products of Russian industry and agriculture reached, 
and in many ways exceeded, world prices, but there has been no 
success in stopping the drop in production. However, the idea 
itself of strict price regulation is meeting the resistance of 
consumers, especially those that are energy-intensive, such as 
metallurgy with its obsolete technologies. And, as a result, the 
size of the established subscriber payment does not allow the 
conduct of investment in the development of a federal power 
industry. But, after all, a number of krays and oblasts of 
Russia have ended up today without their own sources of electric 
power. Kaliningraders are dependent on Lithuania, Pskov 
residents receive their heat and light entirely from Estonia and 
Belarus, and Omsk and Novosibirsk rely on Kazakhstan. The 
northern Caucasus is generally deficient in capacity. 
  The stubborn resistance of the power engineers in March 
stopped the general campaign. But this does not at all mean that 
the military operations have been stopped. It is simply that a 
respite has been declared, after which new summons to the branch 
war are possible, and pogroms, and fierce battles. The sides are 
gathering strength.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Ivantsov, ITAR-TASS, special for </F>
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, under the rubric "Electric Power Sector": 
"On the Verge of Instability"] 
  [Text] The stable operation of the Russian electric 
power sector has long become a customary and even mandatory 
feature of everyday life and the regular functioning of the 
economy. The sector did not forsake its main feature, 
reliability, in the past year, which was very difficult for 
power industry personnel. 
  Professor Anatoliy Dyakov, the head of the new power company 
"YeES [Unified Energy System of Russia], called last year a 
peculiar test of maturity for the company. Having converted the 
enterprises of the sector to joint-stock operations, the new 
company restructured the system of management in the electric 
power sector of Russia while preserving in the process its main 
advantage--the unity of the power system. It is precisely owing 
to this that, in the environment of an economic crisis, the 
generation of electricity fell by as little as 5.5 percent last 
year. 
  However, difficulties entailed by changes in the system of 
management have become secondary compared to daily concerns. 
Nonpayments by consumers of electricity have exceeded the 4 
trillion-ruble mark and have in essence left the industry 
without the funds to develop, despite it being necessary for the 
electric power industry to commission 8-9 million kilowatts of 
capacity annually in order to replace worn-out generators. It is 
fitting to recall that in one-half of the power stations of 
Russia the service life of the equipment has ended completely. 
  Financial difficulties were exacerbated by problems in 
supplying the thermal stations with fuel, in particular coal. 
Thus, at a number of stations in the Urals region fuel reserves 
came to just over 60 percent of the 1992 level, and at power 
stations of the Far East--just 30 percent. 
  The plan for 1994 is to reduce coal production by 50-60 
million tonnes, which will primarily deal a painful blow 
specifically to the electric power sector. After all, most of 
Russia's 600 thermal stations use coal as their primary fuel. 
  The absence or clearly inadequate reserves of fuel pose the 
threat of stoppages at quite a number of nuclear power stations. 
  In addition to the startup of new power units at the Pskov, 
Nizhnevartovsk, St. Petersburg, and a number of power plants in 
the Far East, the plan is to partially offset the potential loss 
in electricity generation by using more advanced technologies 
for fuel combustion and better energy-saving measures. For 
example, the use of more up-to-date installations for gas 
combustion will make it possible to boost electricity production 
by 10-15 percent, with the volume of fuel used remaining the 
same. 
  Nonetheless, Anatoliy Dyakov believes that the electric 
power 
sector has now approached the danger line beyond which its 
stable operation may be disrupted. A tangle of nonpayments and 
the absence of internal funds rob the power industry personnel 
of the opportunity to acquire even the most necessary items for 
repairs: metal, wire, and welding electrodes. In the opinion of 
the representatives of regional power associations, this year's 
repair campaign is in jeopardy. This is fraught with the danger 
of consumers failing to receive the necessary quantities of heat 
and light. 
  A way out of this complex situation is found in a search for 
a mechanism to eliminate consumer nonpayments. Part of the 
outline for solving this difficult problem has already emerged. 
In particular, it is proposed to switch to a system of bills of 
exchange for mutual settlements between the consumers and 
producers of electricity. A draft for using bank bills of 
exchange as payment documents has already been developed by the 
Russian joint-stock company YeES of Russia together with an 
underwriting syndicate and the Russian Brokerage House. A 
mechanism for solving the nonpayments problem on a broad scale 
may come along if the project is successfully carried out.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Gavrilyuk under the rubric "Duties": </F>
"Some Win, Some Lose"] 
  [Text] It appears that the heated debate that has 
recently begun on account of the government's adoption of 
increased customs duties on imported goods, primarily 
foodstuffs, has entered its final stage. In the opinion of the 
critics of the decree, only the president can bring this bitter 
controversy to an end. 
  What has the discussion shown? Perhaps it merely confirmed 
the truth that, as is often the case, there are two sides to 
every problem. Judge for yourselves. 
  An appeal to the president by trading enterprises, such as 
the Menatep Trading House, Eksportkhleb, Medeya, Eksimer, and 
others, says reasonably that the adoption of the decree imperils 
the very opportunity to fulfill already signed contracts to 
import foodstuffs. The contracts have already been paid for; 
they were signed on the basis of the price situation that 
existed prior to adoption of the decree. Payment of new customs 
duties may now result in bankruptcy for most of these 
structures. After all, tens of thousands of tonnes of foodstuffs 
are at issue. For example, the Menatep Trading House alone has 
imported foodstuffs worth 80 billion rubles [R] to Moscow. 
  Moscow, just like St. Petersburg, is a special case. This 
has 
to do with the fact that, as the leaders of the capital city 
testify, imported foodstuffs take up 52 percent of the 
foodstuffs market in the city. Minister of Agriculture Viktor 
Khlystun gives even more impressive numbers: He maintains that 
the proportion of foodstuffs from abroad in these cities comes 
to 70 percent. This makes understandable the concern of the 
mayors of these cities and Yekaterinburg, where the situation is 
by all signs similar. Prospects of a reduced selection and 
rapidly soaring prices of foodstuffs alarm the leaders. 
  After all, this is not about exotic fruits and gourmet fare 
but, for example, powdered milk for dairy plants, meat products, 
and granulated sugar for the confectionery industry. Last year 
70,000 tonnes of dry milk alone were purchased for the capital 
city through imports. Yuriy Luzhkov's anxiety is not without 
reason, that is the truth. Let us say that the quantity of milk 
and dairy products may diminish and, therefore, products made of 
milk will become more expensive. 
  However, it is also true that, in the words of Anatoliy 
Petukhov, chairman of the Mozhayskiy joint-stock company in the 
vicinity of Moscow, the herd of cows on this former sovkhoz has 
been reduced by 200 head. What is the reason? They do not know 
what to do with natural milk; yet the procurement price per 
liter of milk in Moscow was R158 in February, while the retail 
price was R450-470. The picture in St. Petersburg was 
approximately the same. Therefore, the following observation by 
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha can be considered 
quite reasonable: Since the mayors are concerned about the 
possible growth of prices, they may very well apply themselves 
by reducing various intermediate services. 
  For now, the selection in many shops of Moscow, for example, 
such as the Tverskoy delicatessen, consists of imported goods. 
Aleksey Filippov, commercial director of the store, thinks: 
"Eighty percent of our foodstuffs are foreign. Naturally, once 
the batches imported before 15 March run out, foodstuffs will 
become more expensive, and fewer of them will be purchased." 
  Nonetheless, it is easy to notice that the new customs 
duties 
will entail superprotectionism for the domestic producer, will 
rule out imports as an "instructor" in the better quality of 
goods, and will eliminate the incentive to reduce costs. A 
situation whereby unprofitable farms will remain such under the 
new tariffs is quite possible: Structural changes in agriculture 
are proceeding too languidly; somehow we still cannot get down 
to reducing the producer cost of agricultural products. To be 
sure, for the sake of fairness we must note that, as our 
agrarians maintain, the uncompetitiveness of the Russian 
producer is also entailed by the fact that agricultural 
production is more than 50 percent subsidized in Western 
countries. 
  What else is behind the increase in customs duties, apart 
from the proclaimed defense of the economic interests of Russian 
agricultural producers? I believe that it is, first, an attempt 
at more powerful state regulation of foreign economic activities 
and, second, the calculation that this action will yield almost 
$4 million [as published] for the state budget. It is hard to 
say what this calculation is based on: In the opinion of some 
experts, the traders already know how to bypass customs in the 
process of importing goods and how to understate their cost if 
they have to legally transport foodstuffs across the border. 
  Nonetheless, for now the main question still remains--will 
foodstuffs become more expensive and by how much? Some believe 
that a 15-20 percent raise in customs duties will result in a 
twofold growth of retail prices due to credit costs. 
  Others, including Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, 
have stated that the new duties will have virtually no influence 
on the growth of prices because substantial reserves of food 
staples have now been accumulated in Russia, which the peasants 
do not know what to do with. In particular, reserves of meat 
products in Russia as of 1 March came to 226,000 tonnes, which 
would suffice to supply the country for one month; reserves of 
milk come to 1.222 million tonnes, butter--45,500 tonnes, and 
sugar--594,000 tonnes, that is, there is 3.5 times more of it 
than there was last year. 
  Nonetheless, the fight over the government decree on import 
duties goes on. Hence the terms in the vocabulary of the 
agricultural minister which are more fitting for a military 
commander. Viktor Khlystun is convinced that "massive 
agricultural intervention from abroad, especially in 1993, is 
one of the reasons for the current crisis in the Russian 
agrarian sector." The "heavy artillery" has also thundered. In a 
telegram to the president and the prime minister, the chairmen 
of the agrarian committees of the Council of the Federation and 
the State Duma, Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy and Aleksandr Nazarchuk, 
called for "preventing cancellation of the decree on confirming 
rates of customs duties on imports." 
  What are we, the civilian population, dejectedly looking at 
the price tags in the stores every day, to do? Wait and, like in 
any war, pray and hope for mercy from the victor, all the more 
so because Minister of Agriculture Viktor Khlystun has promised: 
"In 1994 the Russian peasants are capable of meeting the 
country's needs for foodstuffs, and lacking food items can be 
delivered from CIS countries for which duty-free trading 
procedures remain in effect." 
  This might be so. However, reports are already coming in: 
Having assessed the situation, domestic producers in some 
locations have raised prices for butter and poultry, chicken in 
particular. Ultimately, one thing is clear: The duties that have 
been introduced are a temporary measure. The main decisions lie 
ahead.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kucherenko under the rubric "Civil </F>
Code": "Property Is Sacred, Contract Is Inviolable"] 
  [Text] Last week Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court 
of Arbitration V. Vitryanskiy presented to a regular plenary 
session of the court a draft of the first chapter of the Civil 
Code of the Russian Federation--a constitution of sorts, the 
"main law" for the creation of economic regulations. 
  It was approved in the main by the Presidium of the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers, with proposals from 34 
components of the Federation being taken into account. At 
present, the Supreme Court of Arbitration intends to submit the 
draft to the Duma in an exercise of legislative initiative. 
  The chapter "General Provisions" envisions fundamental 
provisions: norms concerning the exercise and protection of 
civil rights, their subjects and objects, transactions, 
representation, and statutes of limitation. Many of them are 
absolutely new in the legislation in effect. 
  For example, commercial organizations (except for state and 
municipal enterprises) will be endowed with general legal 
capacity which will give them the right to engage in all types 
of entrepreneurship, provided licensing procedures are complied 
with. Uniform procedures for the registration of enterprises and 
a state register of legal entities will be introduced. This will 
make it possible for everyone to verify the real standing of 
their business partners. 
  Unlike the previous "Law on the Enterprise and 
Entrepreneurial Activities," the code recognizes unlimited 
companies as legal entities, regulating their status in such a 
way as to avoid the passage of additional laws. So-called 
limited partnerships are being introduced which have partners 
who venture only the contributions made, along with those who 
are fully liable. The now confused issues of parent and 
subsidiary joint-stock companies will be clarified, and the 
notion of dependent companies and structures with mutual 
participation in each other's capital will be defined. 
  A barrier has been erected to the fraudulent use of state 
and 
municipal enterprises. They will be declared unitary (i.e., 
united, integral); they will not be used for operations not 
directly envisioned in their statutes. The state, as well as 
state and municipal structures, will be able to participate in 
civil relations under the law, being liable for their 
obligations with the assets of the treasury. 
  The legal regimen of the main objects of civil rights has 
been defined in detail, especially that of real estate, the 
rights to and transactions with which are subject to 
registration by the state, including undocumented rights and 
transactions that exist in computer memory. 
  All owners will be given general guarantees of their rights. 
However, federal laws can establish specifics of the regulation 
of various forms of property. The scope of cases in which the 
involuntary taking of property from its owners is permitted, and 
then only by a court decision and with preliminary compensation 
for the inflicted losses, is circumscribed quite exhaustively. 
Arbitrary administrative restrictions of the rights of state 
enterprises are ruled out. 
  It is expected that land legislation will not duplicate the 
norms of civil legislation, but will regulate conditions and 
procedures for the distribution, use, and protection of land, 
proceeding from public and state interests. The fact that 
categories of land will appear that cannot be put to other than 
the intended use has also been taken into account. Hence the 
rules for the confiscation of such parcels from violators with 
compensation. 
  Contracts are another mainstay of a market economy. The new 
code regulates in detail the ways to ensure that obligations are 
honored: liquidated damages, collateral, suretyship, bank 
guarantees, and advance payments. 
  Mechanisms, both judicial and nonjudicial, for the exercise 
of the rights of those to whom property has been pledged have 
finally been developed. The pledge of real estate should be 
regulated by the future law on mortgages. 
  The new institution of bank guarantees is being introduced. 
It does not depend on the main obligation for securing which it 
has been issued. Unlike a surety, the guarantor (a bank, another 
credit institution, an insurance organization) may refuse to 
honor a creditor's claim only if this claim does not conform to 
the terms of guarantee, or was submitted to the guarantor after 
the deadline set forth in it. 
  A number of provisions are aimed at increasing liability for 
violating obligations, in particular those associated with 
entrepreneurship. Stricter responsibility is envisioned for the 
latter when there has been a failure to meet obligations or they 
have been met improperly. To avoid liability, an entrepreneur 
must prove that the violation was caused by an act of God. 
  The issue of losses has also been clarified. In determining 
their extent, one will have to proceed from the prices and bank 
rates that existed either at the moment of voluntary compliance 
by the debtor with the demands of the creditor or on the day the 
court ruling was made. 
  Two entire sections are devoted to contracts. Citizens and 
legal entities will be free to sign them. The terms of contracts 
will be determined by agreement between the parties. However, 
cases in which the conclusion of a contract by one of the 
parties is mandatory or the content of an agreement is dictated 
by legislation will be exceptions. 
  The pathos of these parts is designed to prevent the 
principle of freedom of contracts from resulting in unbridled 
arbitrary practices by entrepreneurs, in particular monopolies. 
The economically weaker party to the contracts, primarily 
consumers and citizens, require protection, too. For this 
reason, the code contains the notion of "public contracts." It 
applies to relations with the participation of commercial 
organizations--retail merchants, owners of public 
transportation, energy supply, health care and hotel services, 
communications, and so on. Such companies are not entitled to 
evade the signing of contracts or grant preferences to certain 
individuals in signing contracts. 
  Procedures for amending and canceling agreements will be 
made 
stricter in order to make contractual relations stable. A 
contract may be amended or canceled upon the demand of one of 
the parties by a court decision only if the other party has 
substantially violated it.

<F P=106> [Report based on data of the Russian Federation Committee on </F>
Metallurgy: "Analysis of Work of Nonferrous Metallurgy 
Enterprises in January 1994"] 
  [Text] Production of output from nonferrous metallurgy 
enterprises continued to drop in January 1994. Thus, as compared 
with December 1993, production of tungsten concentrate declined 
by 79.3 percent; of hard alloys--by 67.0 percent; of refined 
copper--by 41.5 percent; of sponge titanium--by 32.2 percent; of 
zinc--by 13.6 percent; and of primary aluminum--by 3.9 percent. 
There was increased production of only molybdenum 
concentrate--by 0.6 percent--and lead--by 12.4 percent. A 
similar picture is observed when compared with production in 
January 1993. 
  In January 1994, some plants remained "on vacation" because 
of insolvency caused by rising prices for coal, raw materials, 
and transport and the decline in consumption of metal output. 
  On Russia's domestic market, consumption of aluminum 
declined 
by half and consumption of copper, zinc, lead, and tin declined 
by 25-30 percent in 1993 as compared to 1992. Export of 
nonferrous metals did not compensate for the reduced domestic 
consumption largely because of higher prices for energy 
resources and fuel; their proportion in the prime cost of 
nonferrous metals is higher than for ferrous metals. The 
effectiveness of exporting nonferrous metals at present is the 
result of revising and lowering export duties. 
  The financial status of enterprises continues to be 
difficult. If we compare the balance assets and liabilities of 
enterprises for industrial activity, a general trend is 
identified: the proportion of real estate in assets is 
declining, while the proportion of sources of inhouse capital in 
liabilities is decreasing. And in contrast, in both assets and 
liabilities debtor and creditor indebtedness is rising, which 
prevents enterprises from operating normally. 
  For example, the proportion of sources of inhouse capital 
declined by a factor of 1.4 of its former level, and creditor 
indebtedness increased by a factor of 1.8 in polymetal industry 
enterprises during the first nine months of 1993. 
  In December 1993, in terms of the level of labor payment, 
the 
nonferrous metallurgy of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian Committee 
on Metallurgy] was sixth among the sectors of industry (182,000 
rubles [R] as opposed to an average level in industry of 
R145,700). The highest average monthly wage remained in the 
aluminum industry and the lowest in the solid alloy industry, 
while the number of people working in those sectors increased by 
6.5 percent and decreased by 7.1 percent, respectively. 
  Of the total amount of work time losses because of 
production 
stoppages at nonferrous metallurgy enterprises which presented 
reports in 1993, special metallurgy enterprises accounted for 
two-thirds (more than 2 million worker days), and of that the 
Belokalitvinskiy MPO [Metallurgical Production Association] 
accounts for almost 1.2 million worker days. Significant losses 
of work time occurred at enterprises of the solid alloy industry 
too, for the most part because of the lack of sale of output: 
the Pobedit plant had downtime almost every month which totaled 
about 140,000 worker days during the year, while the figure was 
61,700 worker days at the Kirovograd Plant. Wages at both 
enterprises were low. 
  The number of people working at Roskommetallurgiya 
nonferrous 
metallurgy enterprises in 1993 declined by 0.5 percent, and PPP 
[industrial production personnel]--by 1.0 percent. At 
enterprises which are working well and expanding by producing 
output different from their specialization the figure actually 
increased: it more than doubled at the Nadvoitsy Aluminum Plant; 
it increased by 22.5 percent at the Kyshtym Copper Electrolyte 
Plant; and it increased by 18.5 percent at the Bratsk Aluminum 
Plant. 
  At enterprises with low labor payment, the number of 
employees as a rule declined: by 25.3 percent at the Dzhida 
Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine; by 20.3 percent at the Samara Steel 
Mill; by 20.1 percent at the Vishnevogorsk Mine Administration; 
and by 15.6 percent at the Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant. 
  According to the 1993 results, most nonferrous metals were 
sold at the MBTsM [Moscow Nonferrous Metals Exchange] (86.8 
percent of all sales). The dynamics of growth in exchange prices 
for virtually all nonferrous metals were positive. Their level 
is still lower than the level of prices on the London Metals 
Exchange.

"Can You Imagine? The Mine Is Being Shut Down...] 
  [Text] The settlement of Khalmer-Yu is becoming an 
"experimental testing ground" where the process of eliminating 
unpromising coal mining enterprises is under development. 
  So after 2 years of debate, specific preparatory work has 
begun to resettle the people and shut down the first of the 11 
Russian coal mines which are considered to be unpromising and 
destined to be eliminated in the near future. This first 
enterprise--a unique experimental testing ground--is the 
Khalmer-Yu mine of the "Vorkutaugol" Production Association in 
the Far North. 
  The difficult and painful process has entered its practical 
phase. The order was signed by Russian Federation Minister of 
Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafranik on 17 February 1994. The first 7 
billion rubles [R] for this purpose have been allocated by the 
Ministry of Finance. Schedules have been set to dismantle the 
principal equipment and remove the mine shafts. 
  The overall program to shut down the unpromising and 
especially unprofitable mines and open pits in the Russian 
Federation as a whole is being concluded. The Independent Trade 
Union of Coal Industry Employees is playing an active role in 
this work by making a strong stand for the priority of social 
guarantees for miners and their families. Specifically with 
regard to the Khalmer-Yu settlement, the measures for social 
protection of the residents following the mine's closure have 
been raised to the government level and guaranteed by Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  "Unfortunately, different production cannot be organized in 
the settlement of Khalmer-Yu," said Vitaliy Budko, chairman of 
the Independent Trade Union of Coal Industry Employees. "After 
stocks have been exhausted and the unprofitable Khalmer-Yu mine 
is shut down, the settlement of several thousand inhabitants 
will cease to exist. This is why all these people should be 
resettled." 
  It has been stipulated that residents of the Khalmer-Yu 
settlement are to be allocated a special one-time compensation 
from the budget to obtain housing in the region where a miner's 
family wishes to live. This is how it adds up: 18 square meters 
of overall space for each family member at a cost of R250,000 
per square meter in prices for the second quarter of 1993--with 
this sum to be indexed subsequently, naturally. That is, if 
prices to build housing in a given town or rural area rose by 
four times as much, let us say, beginning last July, R30 million 
should be allocated to purchase a two-room apartment with a 
total area of 30 square meters. (But if the apartment actaully 
costs less, the sum allocated will be less as well.) The state 
is also to pay for moving belongings and baggage by rail (one 
boxcar per family). 
  As of today, the mine management has already purchased 161 
apartments in Leningrad, Orel, Ivanovo, Nizhegorod, Vladimir, 
and Vologda oblasts at a cost of R3.5 billion. Housing has been 
purchased in accordance with the individual wishes of the 
miners' families. 
  In addition, one more benefit has been provided. The 
settlement's working residents who travel outside the Komi 
Republic in search of work in coordination with the 
administration are given one-time financial assistance in the 
amount of their average wage for 4 months. Altogether, 1,687 
families are to be resettled--270 of them to Vorkuta. Total 
expenditures to resettle the people and shut down the mine (in 
prices for the second quarter of 1993) will be about R43 billion 
(by October next year, this sum will be from R250 billion to 
R500 billion or more). 
  "No, it is not cheap," Vitaliy Budko said. "But if the 
unneeded enterprises are not shut down, huge sums will have to 
be spent--trillions of rubles over several years--for no purpose 
to support the unprofitable mines which have neither industrial 
stocks of coal nor a future. Isn't it more reasonable to spend 
them on work? It will be better for the people, the budget, and 
the state." 
  "Unfortunately," the trade union leader continued, "the 
situation in the sector is being aggravated to the extreme by 
financial problems. The lack of funds is not only postponing 
implementation of the program to shut down unpromising mines and 
pits until an uncertain future, it is putting the miners in an 
extremely difficult position as well. There is no clear-cut 
program today for restructuring the sector and the indebtedness 
for the coal that has been shipped is increasing. All this has 
led to enterprises' bankruptcy, the curtailment of social 
programs in mining towns and settlements, and constant delays in 
wage payments. Meanwhile, in accordance with the wage agreement, 
state support has been authorized for mines and pits through 
subsidies from the Russian Federation budget and budgetary 
appropriations for centralized capital investments. But instead 
of the R11.9 trillion planned for this year, the government has 
allocated R5.6 trillion and is promising another R2 trillion. 
And the rest of the money? Won't this `economizing' turn into a 
social upheaval?" 
  [Golovachev] But after all, Vitaliy Ivanovich, isn't there 
really any money in the treasury? 
  [Budko] By not implementing a structural policy and 
supporting unpromising mines which must be shut down without 
delay, the state is losing immeasurably more and multiplying its 
financial losses. This is not thrifty or prudent. So there never 
will be any money in the treasury. 
  [Golovachev] Which mines are especially unprofitable? Can 
you 
name all 11 mines which are to be shut down? 
  [Budko] In addition to Khalmer-Yu, this group includes the 
Anzherskaya Mine ("Severokuzbassugol" Association), the 
Lvovskaya, Kamenetskaya, and Smirnovskaya mines (all three in 
the "Tulaugol" Association), the Kalachevskaya Mine 
("Chelyabinskugol" Association), the Tsentralnaya, Imeni 
Krupskaya, Zapadnaya, and Tayezhnaya mines (all four in the 
"Kizelugol" Association), and the Khasan Mine ("Primorskugol" 
Association). Seven of these mines have no industrial stocks of 
coal. That is, the coal in the mines has been practically worked 
out. 
  Altogether, about 7,000 persons (industrial production 
personnel) are working at these 10 mines (aside from 
Khalmer-Yu). Each metric ton of coal extracted at these mines 
from the so-called "balanced" reserve brings losses of R3,000 to 
R11,000 (in 1993 prices). As a whole, many millions in financial 
losses. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The alarm expressed by the chairman of the Russian 
trade union is fully justified. The deep crisis in the economy 
has hit the coal industry as well. Every year the volumes of 
coal mined are dropping by 8 to 10 percent and the 
labor-intensiveness and hazards of mining operations are 
increasing. Two-thirds of the mines are hazardous because of the 
gas and dust, and the danger of spontaneous combustion is high 
in every second mine. More than half (60 percent) of the 238 
mines have been operating for over 20 years. And they have not 
been modernized once. 
  The state, which continues as before to be the principal 
owner in the sector, cannot turn its back on the miners, who 
have become a powerful detonator of political instability, let 
us remember, and "helped" the government of Nikolay Ryzhkov go 
into retirement. And it was precisely the miners who gave strong 
support to Boris Yeltsin when he declared the new policy--the 
policy of reforms. It is very imnportant not to antagonize them 
today... 
  However, the mood of the miners, alas, is not changing in 
favor of the current authorities. The picketing near the White 
House has vividly demonstrated this. In the first quarter, the 
total indebtedness for wages is R440 billion, according to 
Vitaliy Budko. But how can they live without money? In this 
connection, I will quote an excerpt from a simple verse by 
Aleksandr Kuritsyn, published in the miners' newspaper FLAG 
GORNYAKA: 
  We come at midnight, singly and in a small group, but 
they say "It's no use, fellows..." 
  You pester with grievances to no purpose. You will 
receive everything that is yours. After all, this is not party 
or arbitrary rule now. 
  If it does not turn out well with banknotes, we will 
pay you in kind. Less. You will receive what you produced. 
  Concrete for the concrete workers and cloth for the 
fullers. The miners will be bartered for pieces of coal 
  The tire worker will receive tires. And defense workers 
will receive mines. And a boxer will receive his [pay] as a 
fist... 
  So 161 families will leave soon (if there is money for the 
move) from the remote northern settlement of Khalmer-Yu. But 
what can the 6,876 workers in the other 10 unwanted mines 
expect? When will their fate be decided? Will the future become 
clearer for the entire coal industry?
