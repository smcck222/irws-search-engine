<F P=106> [Article by Oldrzhykh Hlavati, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA commentator </F>
on energy problems, professor, doctor of chemical sciences, and 
section chief at the Institute of Biochemistry and 
Petrochemistry under the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences: "The 
Odessa Oil Terminal Seems Important Only to Our Enemies: 
Reverberations Following an Item Published in UKRAYINSKA HAZETA"] 
  [Text] Appearing in the second issue of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 
was an article by a certain Mr. Listopad entitled "Even 70 Grams 
Could Destroy Odessa." This item is a classic example of an 
incompetent discussion of important problems. If it had appeared 
on 1 April, it could have been perceived as a clever joke. 
  In order to demonstrate the professional level of this 
item's 
author, let's analyze just a few of the "pearls" with which it 
is filled to the brim. 
  Thus, for example, the author makes a catastrophic 
prediction 
concerning the Black Sea--"the world's bluest"--by subtracting 
from the 2800 tonnes of oil which could get into the water 2600 
tonnes, from which the sea could--so to speak--cleanse itself. 
If Mr. Listopad had the slighest notion of how to deal with this 
problem, he would know that in such calculations 2800 and 2600 
tonnes are really the same thing. And there are specialists who 
assert that the Black Sea could handle much more than this. 
  Another piece of nonsense in this article is the following: 
"Those persons who were clever enough to catch such 
oil-saturated fish, cook them, and eat them are now lying in 
cancer-treatment facilities." The exact opposite of this 
information is correct. Nowadays many persons ill with cancer 
are being successfully treated with gasoline (by the way, in 
olden times--before petroleum became a fuel, it was utilized for 
treating various diseases). 
  Here's another "pearl": "Burning oil gives off a cloud of 
ammonia, which could turn Odessa into a real graveyard within a 
few hours." I do not know what kind of education Mr. Listopad 
has, but in a high-school chemistry class he would deserve a 
grade no higher than a "Two." 
  It would be interesting to know whether Mr. Listopad 
accumulated this nonsense on his own or whether such 
"information" was, perhaps," imparted to him at the Ecological 
Academy, the president of which is the academician-economist, 
Mr. Dorohuntsov--a person well-known to us by way of the 
parliament. Incidentally, the principal specialists in ecology 
(including that of the above-mentioned terminal) who are working 
for him are also economists who have been generously awarded the 
title of academician. We are remined willy-nilly of Krylov's 
well-known fable about "piemakers" and "shoemakers." 
  The fact that Mr. Listopad's article appeared after the 
decision to build the Odessa Oil Terminal was adopted leads me 
personally to conclude that this is a conscious piece of 
disinformation, directed at undermining the terminal, and thus 
safeguarding and preserving Russia's monopoly on supplying oil 
to Ukraine. Ukrainians, Russians, and members of national 
minorities--to which the article's author also belongs--feel in 
their own stomachs what this monopoly has brought about. The 
reason why the inhabitants of Ukraine, which produces more food 
per capita than Russia, have had to eat worse than the 
inhabitants of Russia (particularly those in Moscow) during the 
last two years is to be explained by this very monopoly. The 
fact is that we do indeed buy oil in Russia at a price which--in 
dollars--amounts to 80 percent of the world price. But as a 
result of the fact that the exchange rate of the ruble to the 
karbovanets--something which is also dictated by Russia--exceeds 
the real price several times over, we in practice are paying for 
this oil at triple the world price. The following paradoxical 
situation has evolved: Our state obtains prices which are too 
low for its agricultural products and then uses this money to 
buy oil in Russia; it then refines it at Ukrainian refineries. 
As a consequence of this activity, we are obtaining not a 
profit, but rather a decline of our agriculture and an increase 
of our debt to Russia (by the way, such a situation was already 
begun by L. Kuchma, who now dreams of becoming president and 
returning Ukraine to the embrace of its "elder brother"). We 
should remind ourselves that Russia is alreading demanding 
that--in exchange for our debts--we give it our oil refineries, 
trunk pipelines, and the reserves of our underground storage 
facilities. In practical terms, this means that Mr. Chernomyrdin 
would be in charge of issuing heat to our apartments and houses. 
Then we will be shown where crabs spend the winter. 
  In concluding the topic of oil terminal safety we should 
remark that France--which is roughly similar to our 
country--takes in approximately 80 million tonnes of oil, 
whereas the United States takes in as much as 300 million tonnes 
(transporting it in tankers from as far away as the Middle 
East!). And there are no serious problems there except for an 
occasional accident. And nobody rejects the idea of oil 
terminals. 
  Therefore, if our terminal is built under the direction of a 
firm which has worldwide experience, the "world's bluest sea" 
will--perhaps--remain virtually unchanged (incidentally its 
greatest pollutant nowadays is Odessa's fecal matter--something 
which Odessa's people's deputies know about). 
  Now about the need for such a terminal. This oil terminal 
must be built as quickly as possible not only because Russia is 
selling us oil at triple the price prevailing on the world 
market, but also because it is sending us very bitter, 
high-viscosity, high-tar, and high-sulfur types of oil (based on 
the principle of "It's no skin off my nose"). This has reached 
the point where the Kremenchug Refinery produces diesel fuel 
having a sulfur content of 1 percent instead of 0.2 percent (as 
a result of which the amount of acid rain has increased by a 
factor of 5). Recently, in connection with the poor quality of 
crude oil, we have not even been able to make lubricating oils 
(products in extremely short supply, and without which we cannot 
sow our crops nor even drive to work). Moreover, as to importing 
such lubricating oils from Russia, that is impossible 
because--despite the enforced cutback in production at Russian 
refineries due to the lack of sales, selling these oils to 
Ukraine is prohibited (Moscow has issued no quotas). 
  In summing up, we specialists must issue the following 
warning: Unless we have an alternative facility for delivering 
energy sources by next winter, we will freeze like the 
Armenians, or we will finally lose our independence. It is also 
likely that--no matter what happens--we will have to get by on 
300 grams of bread, using ration cards as they are now doing in 
Georgia. 
  This past winter (just as during the time of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe) we were saved and protected by the Sophia Mother of 
God. But we must not abuse Her patience. 
  In my next article I will talk about what a negative and 
unpatriotic role the State Committee on Oil and Gas has played 
in solving our energy problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Gherasim, Republic of Moldova minister of </F>
transportation: "Transportation: Prospects and Hopes"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 turned out to be extremely difficult 
for the enterprises and organizations of the ministry. We can 
say that the public transportation of the republic was left 
without work and support. In 1993 the total volume of freight 
carriage by public-use motor vehicles declined to the level of 
1956. Passenger transportation by bus was at the level of 1960; 
fares were down to the level of 1959. 
  If we compare the results of 1993 with the maximum attained, 
12.5 times less freight was carried than in 1986 (120 million 
tonnes), and 6.7 times fewer passengers were carried than in 
1987 (475 million passengers). 
  The truck fleet is down to 6,300 units, which comes to 50 
percent of the 1985 level, that of buses--to 2,540 units, or 60 
percent of the 1988 level, and that of taxicabs--to 795 units, 
or 60 percent of the 1988 level. Out of this fleet of rolling 
stock, 3,800 trucks, 1,100 buses, and 250 taxicabs were idle and 
without work while technically in proper repair. 
  We are losing skilled cadres of automotive personnel. In 
1993 
their number fell by 3,563. The average wage in motor vehicle 
transportation in December of last year came to 56 lei. More 
than 9,000 employees, or 45 percent of the total number of 
employees in the sector, have been furloughed or are working 
short work days. 
  There are enterprises in the sector that are, in essence, 
bankrupt and have not been officially declared so only because 
of the absence of a procedure for effecting this process. 
  It is necessary to recall that public-use motor vehicle 
transportation amounts to only a segment of motor vehicle 
transportation in the republic. Unfortunately, its proportion of 
transportation work fell from 25-40 percent to 8-11 percent (in 
terms of volume of freight transportation). Despite the absence 
of support from the government, the productivity of public-use 
rolling stock remains higher than that of such transportation 
belonging to other departments, and producer cost comes to 82 
percent of the average republic indicator. 
  The ministry has proposed and will strive to solve a number 
of problems in order to improve the situation in the 
transportation sector. First, the adoption of the Law on 
Transportation in the Republic of Moldova and the development of 
new transportation legislation based on it for the main areas of 
operations. The process of privatization and denationalization 
should be accelerated. The experience of other countries and the 
current state of affairs indicate that motor vehicle 
transportation should be private for the most part. In keeping 
with the State Privatization Program, 77 out of the 128 
enterprises reporting to the ministry should be privatized in 
1994 and 1995. This will make it possible to adapt more quickly 
to meeting the needs of the clients and, therefore, to compete 
with departmental motor vehicle transportation more effectively 
(incidentally, the experience of private operators who already 
exist in the republic confirms this). 
  We are going to work, together with other organs of state 
government, on a package of legislative documents that will give 
priority in operations to automotive personnel who perform such 
operations to higher professional standards (through a system of 
excise taxes, local taxes, cost of licenses, credit, state 
investment, and so on). 
  Through our subordinate enterprises and the state we will 
facilitate the development of an infrastructure for motor 
vehicle transportation, forwarding and dispatcher services, 
insurance, freight storage, accounting and settlement 
operations, etc. by establishing companies in these areas, 
merging motor vehicle enterprises into associations to this end, 
and so on. 
  The task of systematizing the flow of information concerning 
automotive transportation operations by all economic agents, 
regardless of their departmental affiliation, and automating and 
computerizing this process with a view to more balanced 
decisionmaking is extensive. 
  Apparently at this stage (1994-1995) it should be proposed 
that incentives be provided for the acquisition of the kind of 
rolling stock the republic needs badly (refrigerated trucks, 
trailer trucks, delivery vehicles). 
  Within the framework of denationalization, we consider it 
necessary to accelerate and enhance proposals to convert some of 
the assets of motor vehicle transportation into municipal 
property for services and the accomplishment of regional tasks. 
  The problem of urban transit is particularly acute. In this 
instance, cooperation by all institutions of the state and the 
population is needed. Of course, targeted investment is a 
priority. 
  The Moldovan Railroad is a very important and complex link 
in 
the national economy. The volume of freight carriage dropped, 
amounting to 6.2 million tonnes, or 3.5 times less than in 1989. 
The level of passenger transportation declined insignificantly 
and came to 16.9 million passengers because of lower fares 
(compared to buses and aviation). 
  The rates in this mode of transportation are more stable, 
although they did change in 1993 by a factor of five for freight 
carriage and by a factor of three for passenger carriage. 
  The republic railroad also has its share of problems. There 
are 220 kilometers of the main track which are overdue for major 
repairs, and an absence of 250,000 wooden ties and other 
structural track materials. The service life of more than 1,500 
freight cars is coming to an end; of 273 diesel locomotives, 45 
were built between 1966 and 1972; of 43 diesel trains, the 
service life of 13 has ended; 15 percent of passenger cars were 
produced more than 20 years ago. 
  Government Decree No. 727 dated 19 November 1993 envisioned 
a 
number of very essential areas of development for the railroad: 
electrification of main lines, construction and upgrading of the 
Revaca-Cainari rail line, and upgrading and expansion of the 
Chisinau and Ungheni railway terminals. A transportation pattern 
is being developed, and the issues of designing and building a 
high-speed rail line to European standards between Istanbul, 
Sofia, Chisinau, and Kiev, expanding the network of rail lines 
in the north and south of the republic, and developing proposals 
to switch to the production of equipment and spare parts for the 
needs of railway transportation at some industrial enterprises 
are being worked on. 
  The volume of carriage by inland waterway transportation 
fell 
considerably; in 1993 only 450,000 tonnes of freight and 465,000 
passengers were carried. At present, it is also difficult to 
coordinate the operation of this mode of transportation because 
of the political situation on the left bank of the Dniester. 
  At present, the attention is mainly focused on expanding the 
operation of the maritime company, including the use of national 
crews, the preparation of materials of a legislative nature for 
maritime and inland waterway transportation, and the expansion 
of work associated with designing a port on the Danube. 
  The year 1993 was difficult and full of strain for the road 
construction and maintenance sector of the republic. Only 215.4 
kilometers of roadway were repaired, or 11 percent of the level 
of 1990 when the maximum volume was attained. Only eight 
kilometers of roads were built. Late passage of the Law on the 
Road Tax in 1993 added to the general problems in this instance; 
it virtually left the sector without funds in the reporting 
year. The funds that were received in the fourth quarter were 
only 80 percent utilized. 
  With a view to improving the situation in the road 
construction and maintenance sector, preparations are being 
conducted for surveying the entire public-use road network and 
classifying roads by their use at present and in the future. 
Priority sections for repairs, upgrading, and construction, 
their length, and outlays are being determined; proposals are 
being developed to improve financing. 
  All areas of development of the sectors of the 
transportation 
complex are closely interconnected and overlap in many 
instances. This is why it is necessary to arrange them in a 
coordinated manner. The aforementioned areas were specified on a 
sectoral basis, but there also are areas of general concern. The 
main ones among them are the development and signing of 
international agreements and treaties, the systematization of 
proposals for the possible attraction of foreign investment, 
development of a program for cadre training and retraining, 
participation in the development of programs for taking 
advantage of the transit situation of the republic, 
participation in ecological programs, and so on. 
  Work in these areas requires considerable labor and the use 
of many specialists, which necessitates that they be paid. 
  Of course, nobody in the ministry stays away from everyday 
work. Nonetheless, a state system of the transportation complex 
of the republic should also be built--not a governmental but 
precisely a state system, that is, one rational from the point 
of view of consumers, of all inhabitants of Moldova. 
  The author requests that the honorarium due to him be 
transferred to the fund of the editorial office.

<F P=106> [Interview with B. I. Birshteyn, by I. Koretskiy; place and </F>
date not given: "Boris Birshteyn: I Am an Absolutely Independent 
Person"] 
  [Text] The name Boris Iosifovich Birshteyn is well 
known on one-sixth of the land mass. He is praised and cursed, 
presidents and journalists want to meet him, and everything from 
cock and bull stories to the unmitigated truth are told about 
the affairs of The Seabeco Group. 
  Seabeco is not being ignored in our republic either. 
The firm is quite often spoken and written about mostly in a 
poor light. Essentially that involves a rehash of Russian events 
which have already set our teeth on edge. Having obtained an 
exclusive interview with Birshteyn, we were interested not in 
rumors and gossip swirling around this outstanding individual, 
but most of all in the personality of the creator of Seabeco, so 
to speak, in its undiluted form: his views of life, business, 
and contemporary Moldova. That was what our conversation with B. 
I. Birshteyn, who has visited our country more than once, was 
about. 
  [Koretskiy] Welcome to Moldova Mister Birshteyn. These days 
the republic is leading an intensive political 
existence--elections and the sociological poll. Is your visit 
associated with these events? 
  [Birshteyn] Absolutely not. This is a routine business trip 
connected with the practical realization of one of our projects 
involving investment in agriculture of Moldova. It is still too 
early to mention it to the press, I will merely say that the 
amount of investment involved is quite respectable even by 
western standards. 
  I do not get involved in politics and it is not my habit to 
exert influence or, God forbid, alter anything in the political 
life of this country in which I am investing my capital. But if 
you are interested in my own personal viewpoint concerning 
recent events, then, naturally, for me as a businessman and for 
my western colleagues it is more advantageous to deal with an 
independent, sovereign state rather than with someone's province. 
  [Koretskiy] Boris Iosifovich, this is your first interview 
with the republic press, therefore please acquaint our readers 
with what is called The Seabeco Group. The Russian as well as 
our own press, unfortunately, contains highly confusing and 
contradictory depictions. This is evidenced by the telephone 
calls and letters coming in to the editorial office. 
  [Birshteyn] H'm! I have not been asked that question for a 
long time. It is considered that everything is known about 
Seabeco. 
  Well, Seabeco is a group of private companies of different 
profiles which I own. Our sphere of activity includes trade, 
particularly trade in fertilizes and metals. It is a financial 
business and includes industrial projects. We are also engaged 
in the service sphere as evidenced by this hotel in Chisinau 
where we are having our conversation. 
  [Editor] Boris Birshteyn was born in Lithuania in 1947 and 
is 
a graduate of Vilnius University. He reached the pinnacle of his 
career in the USSR as director of a textile plant. In 1979 he 
emigrated to Israel together with his wife, then moved to 
Canada. A year later he founded his "The Seabeco Group." To form 
that name he used the first names of his children--Semen and 
Alona Birshteyn. At present the Birshteyn family resides in 
Zurich, Switzerland. 
  [Koretskiy] What links do you have with Moldova? 
  [Birshteyn] A small human weakness which is called love for 
this remarkable nation and its hard-working people. Coming here 
many years ago I was charmed with Moldova and still feel that 
way to this day. Because of which I am attempting to make and do 
make my most serious investments in Moldova. 
  [Editor] Boris Birshteyn made the first major investment of 
his capital in Moldova in 1990 deciding to remodel the old 
Oktyabrskaya Hotel into a four-star western style hotel. That 
was requested by the then leadership of the republic which 
became mired in debt reconstructing its prestigious hotel. These 
debts owed Vneshekonombank of the USSR subsequently transferred 
to the government of sovereign Moldova and when the question 
concerning their repayment became a pressing one, businessman 
Birshteyn proposed an original move as a result of which dollars 
from the repayment of the foreign currency credit debt in the 
amount of over three million dollars went into the budget of the 
republic. In that manner Seabeco is providing the government 
with interest-free credit. Our Moldovan leu was printed in Paris 
and modern communications, defense, and special equipment for 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs were paid for specifically by 
money from the firm. The Orgeyev Cannery is undergoing 
reconstruction and a zone of farms with a complete service 
complex is being created in Faleshtskiy Rayon on the basis of 
Seabeco designs and at its expense. The firm provides assistance 
through sponsorship of projects in the sphere of public health 
and culture as well as aid for those with low incomes and for 
victims of combat operations. Last year some 50,000 leus, over 
2,000 dollars, and more than 4,000 FRG marks were allocated for 
that purpose. 
  [Koretskiy] Mister Birshteyn, without revealing any trade 
secrets pertaining to your future projects, let us talk about 
where your investments will be going. 
  [Birshteyn] I am proceeding from the fact that Moldova is 
basically an agrarian republic and, naturally, I intend 
investing capital in agriculture and, in particular, in the 
processing industry. Then, taking into account the geographical 
position of Moldova, its climate, and the existence of a 
diaspora both in the far and the near abroad, I believe that it 
is necessary to develop a tourism industry. 
  [Koretskiy] Allow me to disagree with your viewpoint 
concerning the agricultural profile of Moldova and remind you of 
the first-class potential of the republic in the machine 
building and electronic industry. Unfortunately these capacities 
are now idle and the industry is in a decline. On the basis of 
your experience could you suggest a way out of this dead-end 
situation? 
  [Birshteyn] I am not an electronics expert but I am quite 
familiar with the experience of Far Eastern countries which 
created such a powerful market in that branch. Therefore today 
it is extremely difficult to meet the demands of modern 
electronics, that is, to win the market. But not hopeless. How? 
Through the production of unique units and blocs calling for the 
efforts of highly skilled personnel. In the East as well as in 
the West everything is based on high-precision automatic 
equipment, flow lines. Moldova, however, would be able to 
interest producers with its highly skilled workers whose labor 
is relatively cheap. Here it is necessary to look for partners. 
I brought up that question with Muravskiy's government. 
  [Koretskiy] Did you bring it up as a member of the Higher 
Economic Council of the President of the Republic of Moldova? 
  [Birshteyn] Yes. Unfortunately, however, nothing happened. 
  [Koretskiy] Tell me, Mr. Birshteyn, as chairman of the 
Higher 
Economic Council do you see a way out of the crisis in which 
Moldova has found itself? 
  [Birshteyn] I would like you to take into account that this 
crisis has engulfed all countries of the so-called socialist 
camp and it is quite natural. Therefore there is no need to 
dramatize the situation. I personally believe that Moldova will 
get on its feet before other CIS countries providing there is a 
stable political situation, because of its geopolitical 
position, economic base, and the industriousness of the people. 
These are the powerful internal reserves which have not been 
mobilized until now. But help and investments are needed in any 
undertaking. That is the first factor which must come into play. 
  Several days ago I helped to organize a meeting of a large 
group of western businessmen with the president of Moldova. The 
discussion concerned investments, big investment projects which 
open up extensive prospects. A frank business dialogue took 
place in the course of which the head of the republic expressed 
doubt in the current course toward acquisition of credits to the 
detriment of investments. If the policy of the government in 
that area should change, consider it to be my small contribution 
as chairman of the presidential council. After all the investor 
brings not only money into this country but also, what is most 
important, his expertise and knowledge, the ability to organize 
the undertaking so that it profits the investor and the country, 
and this means the people as well. In addition to that it allows 
entry into western sales markets which in turn means the reverse 
flow of foreign currency. Is that not advantageous for the 
country? 
  Very many pilot projects were proposed at that meeting which 
will undoubtedly be followed by others. It is a good sign when 
major western firms manifest interest in investing in Moldova. 
  [Koretskiy] Mr. Birshteyn, again, based on your experience 
of 
cooperation with Moldova what obstacles do you visualize in the 
way of these vivifying investments? 
  [Birshteyn] I believe that the answer is clear to anyone 
with 
even a minimal involvement in business. Conditions for the 
development of business are needed. A legislative base is 
required which clearly differentiates the rights and duties of 
the businessman. The domestic and foreign businessman. In order 
to avoid groundless accusations of nation pilfering. How can I 
be pilfering the nation when I am investing my capital in it and 
building? After all Birshteyn, for instance, cannot take this 
hotel or plant, or a processing line with him to Canada. It was 
and will remain the property of this country. My task is that of 
any investor which is to ensure that the property is viable, 
earns profits and provides employment for people. 
  We also touched on another one of these obstacles--the tax 
policy. When taxes exceed a reasonable limit they discourage any 
interest among investors to inject their capital into this 
country. It is possible to understand the young state which is 
attempting to satisfy its needs through the tax system. But not 
at any price. "At any price" is not always the correct policy. 
Life is already suggesting to the politicians where they made an 
incorrect step in that sphere and everything, one must think, 
will return to a normal, civilized path. After all they were 
able to establish some benefits for agriculture and the 
processing industry. That means not everything is lost. 
  [Koretskiy] Let us return to the search of ways to resolve 
the economic crisis. For some of our politicians the creation of 
free economic zones appears as a panacea against all economic 
ills. What do you think about that idea? 
  [Birshteyn] I will not hide the fact that it appeals to me 
and I was one of those who voiced this repeatedly. Except that 
it was not about the economic zone but about the offshore 
business zone. Similar to Liechtenstein and Monaco. It means 
that for local and foreign capital special preferential 
conditions are created for development. These conditions, which 
are covered in international law, allow the state to develop 
necessary branches to its advantage and receive profits for the 
servicing of investments, while building and growing richer, 
without investing its own funds. 
  [Koretskiy] Boris Iosifovich, you stated that you are making 
your main investments in agriculture of Moldova. Great 
transformations are now taking place in the countryside. The 
reform is destroying kolkhozes and allows joint-stock companies 
to develop, along with peasant farms, and farmers. In your 
business dealings who do you prefer working with--kolkhozes or 
individual farms? 
  [Birshteyn] This question, I see, is a loaded one. I will 
answer frankly--I prefer to work with the state. Always. All 
those projects which I mentioned will be carried out together 
with the government on an equal footing. The government will get 
its share and our firm will get its share. All this will take 
place on a contractual basis and the results can be checked 
through documents at any time. 
  [Koretskiy] Excuse me, but here is another "loaded" 
question. 
You worked on the basis of the same principle, i.e. directly 
both in Russia and Kyrgyzstan, which is what gave rise to 
accusations against the Seabeco Firm. 
  [Birshteyn] These accusations, however, burst like a soap 
bubble once documents and facts were presented. Also I find it 
difficult to understand how it is possible to level groundless 
accusations from a high tribune without troubling to acquire 
information from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. 
After all every figure is reflected in it. Since these 
documents made their appearance my stern critics fell silent. 
For those reasons I released an official statement that I am 
terminating my activity in Russia and Kyrgyzia. 
  [Koretskiy] Here, in Moldova, criticism was also leveled 
against Seabeco regarding accuracy of information. 
  [Birshteyn] You know, I pay no attention to that ballyhoo 
either here or over there. There is no time. The accusations 
themselves are so confused and stereotyped that one begins to 
wonder. Is it not absurd to say that Birshteyn, using his 
private aircraft (Ha-Ha) brought over nuclear waste in order to 
bury it in Krikov mines or somewhere in Siberia. 
  Someone wants to put the blame for all the troubles on 
Seabeco or on any foreigner in order to appear patriotic. Time 
usually provides the best evaluation of such phenomena. Even the 
"great sinner" Rutskoy is now free and criminal proceedings were 
initiated against his "righteous" accusers. 
  [Editor] NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA has a packet of documents and 
official papers compiled by various monitoring organizations of 
the republic at different times. They provide a most thorough 
analysis of all activities of the Seabeco-Moldova firm, citing 
figures and balances and reflecting the legislative base 
underlying operation of the firm as well as audits of the mutual 
settlement of accounts with the co-founder. The only violation 
that the auditors were able to reveal was a delay in deduction 
of funds into the Social Fund of the republic, for which a fine 
was levied in the amount of 17,392 Moldovan rubles. 
  [Koretskiy] By the way, about Rutskoy. Your well-known 
flight 
from Moscow to Chisinau on your personal aircraft was viewed in 
the republic in a highly varied manner. Could you shed more 
light on this unusual visit now, sometime after the fact? 
  [Birshteyn] As commonly known there was a war going on at 
that time and it is the most loathsome thing I have ever known 
in my life. My soul rebelled against blood being spilled on the 
land I love, against the suffering and grief of the refugees and 
the overall depression in society. I was informed that the 
figure of Rutskoy was the spark that ignited that war. His 
presence in Tiraspol was viewed as approval of their course, as 
a carte blanche. Knowing him personally I considered it my moral 
duty to ask Rutskoy to come here and help resolve the conflict. 
To my great delight I succeeded. 
  [Koretskiy] Mr. Birshteyn, your faith in male friendship is 
impressive. You have never renounced your friends who worked in 
the CPSU Central Committee after this seemingly invincible party 
disintegrated. You did not disavow Rutskoy either when he was 
put in jail or any of the others who found themselves in 
disfavor. What is that--a pose, self-confidence, a character 
trait? 
  [Birshteyn] In Moldova, inasmuch as I know, that is called 
"Cei sapte ani de acasa" (seven years of home upbringing). I was 
raised in a cultured family where the concept of friendship, 
keeping one's word, and decency were placed above all. 
  My attitude toward a person whether he is a minister, the 
president, or a driver never comes from the desire for personal 
gain. Many of my friends, as they say, had their ups and downs, 
but that did not alter my attitude toward them because am an 
absolutely independent person and treat my attachments as I deem 
necessary, without caring for the opinion of others or 
proceeding from the political situation. I value true friendship 
and know how to prize it. 
  [Koretskiy] Without beating around the bush, tell me how 
compatible are the concepts of morality and business. 
  [Birshteyn] I know that education using the classics of 
Marxism-Leninism as an example, has imbued people with a certain 
stereotypical way thinking in this regard. I would like to note 
that in the business world, real business, decency and keeping 
one's word are valued above all else. That kind of reputation is 
highly valued. 
  In my business dealings I have always tried to take the 
honest path, engage in good business, and attain a certain level 
so that my firm logo would be associated in people's minds with 
good quality work. A few days ago I met a gentleman who thanked 
me for the high quality of my sports outfits. But, good heavens, 
I was in sports outfits some ten years ago. This means that the 
buyer remembered and appreciated it. This is very important and 
dear to me. 
  To earn money just for the sake of money is a boring 
undertaking. I have always wanted for my capital to bring good 
to people. That is why I have built and will continue to build, 
I am initiating new projects that will remain after I am gone. 
That, after all, is also morality. The fact that such a style of 
work does not appeal to some and they attempt to blacken 
everything is also a peculiar form of morality. Fortunately time 
puts everything in its place. Passions will calm and they will 
be forgotten, while this hotel and much else will remain and 
serve the people and Moldova. 
  [Editor] Boris Birshteyn does not like being over-cautious. 
He is not prone to sentimentality and reflection which are so 
peculiar to the intelligentsia, or apprehension which is 
characteristic of entrepreneurs of Soviet origin. His trusting 
nature is combined with a narrowly utilitarian outlook and 
pragmatism. 
  Mr. Birshteyn cannot "stop and glance back" to show off 
before a mirror, to brag, let us say, about his wealth, and rest 
on his laurels. He sincerely believes himself to be a gentleman 
who has never harmed anyone. Birshteyn has so little time for 
thinking about himself that he hesitated answering questions 
about what color his eyes are or how many languages he speaks., 
  Boris Birshteyn speaks Russian, German, English, Yiddish, 
and 
Ivrit and uses them all in his work. 
  [Koretskiy] A new strata of business people is now forming 
in 
Moldova. What errors would you warn them against? 
  [Birshteyn] Against "grab and rest." That is unpromising. It 
is important to think and act in a broader fashion. Here I see 
one of my own omissions which I am hoping to rectify. The thing 
is that Moldova has no good schools for business training. I 
managed to establish something like that in Kyrgyzia. It is 
staffed by highly qualified foreign professors who teach the 
ABC's of modern business life. Graduates receive not only an 
international class diploma, but also good knowledge which helps 
them start their own businesses. I hope that such a business 
school will appear in Moldova as well. 
  [Editor] We, however, are hoping that not just a business 
school as such will make its appearance in Moldova, but a school 
of Moldovan business in the broadest sense of the word, i.e. our 
own class of business people who will build business on the 
basis of principles propounded by B. I. Birshteyn.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stepan Topal, president of the Gagauz </F>
Republic, by G. Golya; place and date not given: "Stepan Topal: 
'I Believe in the Wisdom of New Politicians....'"] 
  [Text] To the surprise of many people, the residents 
of rayons densely settled by the Gagauz population displayed the 
greatest activity during a parliamentary elections held in the 
republic and the sociological poll "Council With the People." As 
late as two weeks before the election, the local administration 
spoke about the intention of a majority of the population not to 
participate in these actions. 
  However, the politicians of Chisinau and Komrat 
summoned up the courage to rise above past wrongs and to take 
steps toward each other. As a result, about 100,000 citizens of 
Moldova of Gagauz nationality who desire peace and stability on 
this rich land were given an opportunity to take advantage of 
the right to vote. Their hearts are alive with the new hope that 
the confrontation will come to an end, and that the Gagauz knot 
which has been tightly tied over the last three years will be 
untied reasonably. This is how our dialogue with Stepan Topal, 
then president of the unrecognized Gagauz Republic, began. 
  [Topal] The elections proceeded successfully, and political 
life has calmed down somewhat. A session of our parliament held 
on 11 March ratified the results of the sociological poll during 
which an absolute majority of the Gagauz came out in favor of 
Moldova's independence. Simultaneously, we held a referendum 
during which local residents came out in favor of the existence 
of the Gagauz Republic within a united Moldova. 
  We now live in anticipation--anticipating that the 
leadership 
of Moldova in the person of President Snegur and the political 
forces that have come to power will keep their election promises 
and solve the Gagauz problem. 
  We are satisfied with the results of the elections; after 
all, precisely those parties that the Gagauz population 
supported have come to power. Both the Agrarian-Democratic Party 
and the Socialist Party have given positive assurances to the 
effect that they will resolve the Gagauz issue at the very first 
session. 
  [Golya] Did this promise prompt the Gagauz administration to 
reconsider its original decision? 
  [Topal] Not just this. Perhaps the Congress "Our Home--the 
Republic of Moldova" which was held in early February was the 
turning point. For the first time in the last three years 
President Snegur and other leaders from Chisinau officially 
stated at the congress that the Republic of Moldova is building 
its own statehood, not striving to unite with Romania, will 
ensure equal rights for all its citizens, and will not allow 
them to be infringed upon. 
  This coincides fully with our position; for three years we 
have been fighting for Moldova's sovereignty and independence. 
It appears that our intentions coincide at present. 
  Being aware of the situation, we accommodated them, opened 
polling stations, and facilitated active participation of the 
people in the elections, although we were apprehensive about 
being cheated yet again by Moldovan politicians. The ball is in 
Chisinau's court. We would like to hope that our worst 
apprehensions will not come true. 
  [Golya] What is the explanation for the fact that most 
voters 
in areas densely settled by the Gagauz population voted in favor 
of the Electoral Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Unity 
Movement? 
  [Topal] Perhaps it is due to their having worked with the 
voters more. To be sure, quite a few Gagauz voted in favor of 
the Agrarian-Democratic Party. Judging by their programs, these 
very political forces are capable of justifying our 
expectations. A bigger vote for the Socialists might also have 
been due to the fact that most of the candidates from the 
Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova were also members of the 
old parliament. They were not able to resolve the Gagauz issue, 
and for this reason the voters had less confidence in them. 
  [Golya] Stepan Mikhaylovich, at the outset, when fundamental 
differences existed between Komrat and Chisinau, you cooperated 
with the Dniester area and provided feasible support to each 
other. How are your mutual relations developing at present? 
  [Topal] Normally. We have signed a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation and we fully comply with it. The Dniester area has 
helped us with the necessary energy resources and other 
materials. We believe that the problems of the Dniester area and 
Gagauzia should be solved in parallel. Failure to solve the 
Gagauz problem will affect the Dniester area, and the other way 
around. It is necessary to resolve the status of the Dniester 
area and Gagauzia as soon as possible and to determine the state 
structure of Moldova. 
  [Golya] How do you see it? 
  [Topal] We should proceed from reality. We believe that, by 
all signs, a federated or confederated structure is the most 
realistic under current conditions. I do not understand why some 
politicians and statesmen of Moldova are in mortal fear of this. 
After all, there have been dozens of examples throughout the 
world of countries with federated structures retaining their 
integrity. 
  Such is our opinion. It virtually does not contradict the 
draft law on Gagauz Eri autonomous oblast within the framework 
of which President Snegur proposes to solve the problem. 
  However, this should be a draft developed with the 
participation of our representatives rather than the one that 
was written in one night in the office of Mr. Arseni. Many 
questions were raised concerning this document in Strasbourg 
during an expert evaluation. We are now forwarding our 
clarifications to the Council of Europe and hope that the new 
parliament will discuss a draft law which is drawn up with our 
remarks taken into account. 
  [Golya] Perhaps some problems of the Gagauz may and should 
be 
solved within the framework of the Law on Ethnic Minorities, 
too.... 
  [Topal] Possibly. We are prepared to participate in its 
development in order to ensure guaranteed rights for all 
residents of Moldova. However, it should be kept in mind that 
the Gagauz do not consider themselves an ethnic minority. I 
would like to ask those who maintain this: Where do the Gagauz 
form an "ethnic majority?" We will not reach an accord if we 
once again begin by discriminating against an entire people, the 
Gagauz people. In the old parliament we heard enough statements 
to the effect that the Gagauz are strangers, that they are not a 
people. 
  [Golya] Some Gagauz were elected to parliament only on the 
ticket of the Agrarian-Democratic Party because from the 
beginning of the election campaign you actually ignored the 
latter. Are those too few, perhaps? 
  [Topal] The Gagauz should receive a quota of their own in 
the 
new parliament, just as in the structures of executive power. We 
hope that the new parliament will show understanding for this 
problem and will give our representatives an opportunity to work 
within the state structures. Otherwise it would be difficult to 
say that our problem has been completely solved. The point is 
that the Gagauz who came to the parliament on the tickets of 
various parties represent themselves rather than the Gagauz 
people. They live in Chisinau, and their hearts do not exactly 
bleed for their fellow Gagauz. This is not a rebuke to them; 
such is reality. 
  [Golya] How do you structure your foreign policy? 
  [Topal] We consider ourselves to be an autonomous entity 
within the Republic of Moldova, and proceed from this. 
Naturally, if the Gagauz problem is solved we will have no claim 
to pursuing our own foreign policy. 
  We believe that these issues, as well as defense, state 
security, and some other crucial problems should be the 
prerogative of Chisinau rather than the local organs of power. 
At the same time, a close relationship has developed between us 
and Turkey because it is a kindred country. We have specific 
plans concerning economic cooperation. For example, it is 
planned to build a tile plant in Komrat in which the Turkish 
side is prepared to invest 30-35 percent. 
  There are also plans to provide telephone communications in 
Komrat and the entire Budzhak region with the help of the 
Turkish company TRT. In addition, the late President of Turkey 
Turgut Ozal promised to allocate $35 million for the development 
of the Gagauz region. It was planned to use the funds, for 
example, to complete the construction of the "South" canal so as 
to finally provide water for the entire region which has been 
officially acknowledged to be a zone of marginal farming. 
  In a word, there are many plans. The Consulate of Turkey in 
Chisinau is giving us all kinds of assistance. For example, 
owing to the consulate, about 200 of our students are already 
studying in Turkey. 
  Otherwise, implementation of the plan depends entirely on 
how 
the parliament solves our problem. If there is peace and 
tranquility, there will be investment and support from developed 
countries. 
  [Golya] As far as is known, for now you advocate the 
ratification of all agreements within the framework of the CIS 
and the Economic Union. 
  [Topal] Naturally, we believe that there is no other way 
out. 
The abandonment of traditional economic relations in the absence 
of real integration with the West has brought about the economic 
catastrophe all of us are facing. 
  [Golya] What solution to the language problem do you see? 
Are 
you personally fluent in the Moldovan language? 
  [Topal] Personally, like most elderly Gagauz, I know the 
Moldovan language, although I am not perfectly fluent in it. 
  I see a solution to this problem in creating normal 
conditions for language instruction rather than in forcible 
Moldovization or, worse yet, Romanization. Attempts at forcibly 
making us learn the language caused a negative response. The 
Gagauz began to pull their children out of Moldovan day care 
centers and stopped learning the language. This would not have 
happened had an opportunity been given to study the language 
voluntarily and normal conditions provided. The Gagauz are not 
against the Moldovan language; they are against discrimination 
along language lines. The new parliament has a duty to postpone 
certification, if not cancel it; this would substantially reduce 
confrontation in our society. 
  [Golya] We are now in the third year since the day you were 
elected president. During this time you have seen few pleasant 
moments and have heard many threats. Do you regret putting this 
heavy burden on your shoulders? 
  [Topal] I am not a politician; all my life I have worked on 
road construction. However, since the people elected me, I must 
pull my weight until the end. You cannot cheat your destiny.

<F P=106> [Interview of Saeima Deputy Janis Straume by Inara Egle: "`I </F>
Always Remind Myself Why I Came Here'"] 
  [Text] Deputy Janis Straume of the Saeima faction "For 
Fatherland and Freedom" has been a rather visible politician in 
recent years. At least those who followed along with the 
activities of the Latvia Committee of the Citizen's Congress 
noticed him. That is why it is unusual to acknowledge that very 
little is known about Janis Straume. The day that I understood 
why that was so I decided to reveal it to him. 
  [Egle] You smile so rarely and often appear a bit angry. You 
should not do that, otherwise journalists will be afraid to 
address you. 
  [Straume] That is true. I have often been criticized for 
being gloomy. Some people in the faction have said that a 
politician must be more loose. But I am by nature rather closed 
and truly smile only rarely. I do not like loud and bravura-like 
conversations. Changing my nature now is difficult. It would be 
a question of training. 
  [Egle] Synthesizing your open essence with the ideas you 
started out with, one might guess about your past. You, of 
course, have never been, for instance, a Komsomol member? 
  [Straume] I really have never been that. 
  [Egle] A dissident? 
  [Straume] No, a hooligan. 
  [Egle] That, too, might be interesting. Tell us about it! 
  [Straume] That was in 1978 in Sigulda, where we, three 
like-minded fellows, established a nationally-oriented little 
group, which occupied itself with preparing various 
proclamations to inform the inhabitants of Sigulda about those 
things that everyone today knows about. 
  [Egle] Who were your like-minded friends and what are they 
doing now? 
  [Straume] One was my friend from childhood and Klavs 
Elsbergs 
prize winner, the poet Edvins Raups. I do not know anything 
about the further course of the other, Juris Vaiders. 
  [Egle] How old were you then? 
  [Straume] Fifteen. For half a year we worked successfully, 
not getting caught either with the "dictation" of school 
administrators, for in those leaflets each one of us wrote one 
letter and the Chekha could not make anything out from our 
handwriting. Later we became careless and began writing out 
leaflets in our own handwriting. Then there was another 
dictation and within a week we all were taken in. 
  [Egle] But you said that you were a hooligan? 
  [Straume] With the leaflets we were able to educate people, 
not draw attention to ourselves. That is why we rather 
childishly occupied ourselves with breaking windows. 
  [Egle] What system determined which windows you chose? 
  [Straume] We were breaking those in the apartments of party 
functionaries. And to a large degree that saved us. All three of 
us were tried for hooliganism with a prison sentence of one 
year, suspended. No political leaflets figured into this matter. 
  [Egle] Do you remember the name of the judge? How would you 
proceed if you had to vote in the Saeima to confirm him? 
  [Straume] The judge was Voldemars Subrovskis, currently the 
chairman of the judges' association. The Saeima has already 
voted on him. I do not regard it as possible to vote to confirm 
for life tenure any judge, with the current judicial system and 
the associated legal disorder. 
  [Egle] How did you know the truth that needed to be told to 
people when you were fifteen years old? 
  [Straume] It is in my genes. All of my closest relations, 
mother, her brothers, grandmother and grandfather, were exiled 
to Siberia. When I was three years old my father perished under 
mysterious circumstances which are still unclear, while he was a 
draftee in the Soviet army. I was often told that this regime is 
unbreakable, that I should not resist. Those close to me wanted 
to shield me, but that only gave rise to the opposite effect. At 
night I read the real books and I knew what I had to fight for. 
  [Egle] Did holding consistant ideas cause difficulties after 
finishing school? 
  [Straume] Thanks to school principal, Valdis Jekabsons, my 
record did not include the fact that I was tried and after high 
school I enrolled in the Riga Institute of Medicine. In my first 
course, in the first semester I was the only non-Komsomolist and 
the only honors student. And then certain problems did indeed 
arise. 
  [Egle] What sort? 
  [Straume] Attempts to recruit me as a Chekha informer began. 
I was summoned seemingly to see the Rector, then the responsible 
official reminded me of my past and said that in my road to 
advancement I was accepted to the institute and now I ought not 
abuse the hospitality. That very night I called together my 
group members, those closest friends at the institute, and told 
them everything so that they would know, if anything happened to 
me, if I was thrown out of school, why it was done. And with 
that it all ended, for the information obviously was broadcast 
back. 
  [Egle] So you graduated from the institute? 
  [Straume] Yes, and with a clear conscience. I have worked 
for 
ten years in medicine. When the Awakening began and I started to 
look for contacts among people who were working in the 
"Helsinki" group and the LNIM [Latvian National Independence 
Movement], then I worked at Riga Municipal Clinical Hospital No. 
3 as a functional diagnostic doctor and later at the Republic of 
Latvia's Diagnostic Center I specialized as an endoscopic 
doctor. Until the elections I worked in medicine and now I am 
surprised that it is rather easy to survive the interruption of 
medical practice. 
  [Egle] Was it easy to mix it with political activity 
earlier? 
  [Straume] I would not want to connect my life with politics 
completely and I hope to return to medicine. My political 
biography begins with activity in the LNIM, when I was the 
movement's Sigulda area chairman. To bring together people who 
stood against Soviet power, both the "Helsinki-ists" and the the 
LNIM, it was acknowledged: It was necessary to organize a 
political party. Thus was born the Republican party of Latvia, 
which in the Citizens Congress elections won quite a few 
mandates, although it had only a small organization. The next 
fact worthy of mention was connected to the establishment of the 
18 November Union, which united part of the Republican party and 
the radical wing of the PFL [Popular Front of Latvia], which 
left the Front. 
  [Egle] Until the second congress you were the chairman of 
the 
18 November Union? 
  [Straume] Yes. Now we elected Maris Grinblats. Among other 
things we and Maris are helped in the parliament by the 
experience we gained in the Citizens Congress. That provided the 
opportunity also to understand the parliamentary work style, 
which was well organized in the Citizens Congress. It is 
interesting that there in the beginning I was in the opposition, 
as a member of the Republican party, but later I was in a 
leadership post. Along with that it is clear that one must 
function in one instance, as in the other and the process in the 
parliament does not cause alarm. 
  [Egle] You do not make speeches in the Saeima very often, 
but 
when you do the speeches are well prepared. Is it true that they 
are written by your assistant, Aigars Jirgens? 
  [Straume] That is a provocative question. We all write our 
own speeches, but I would not want to deny that Aigars Jirgens 
helps to prepare them, for the faction practices collective 
work, that before any speeches are made, bills proposed to 
[Saeima] commissions, etc, they are carefully prepared and 
discussed, including my speeches. I must also remind you that 
Maris Grinblats and Aigars Jirgens have had authority already 
since the time of the Citizens Congress. 
  [Egle] Why did you decide to work in the Saeima's State 
Administration and Local Government Commission? 
  [Straume] There are only six deputies in our faction and we 
selected the six most important commissions. 
  [Egle] So, you do not have any experience in local 
government 
work? 
  [Straume] I have experience with the Citizens Congress 
internal affairs commission. I must add that "For Fatherland and 
Freedom" already had many proposed laws already drafted, with 
which we arrived at the Saeima, and many of them must be 
reviewed in the State Administration and Local Government 
Commission, which is why it is good that someone from the 
faction participates in its work. 
  [Egle] Was the commission also given the "Fatherlanders'" 
project regarding limitations on appointments to posts? 
  [Straume] The State Administration and Local Government 
Commission, it seems, was the only one that voted that this kind 
of law limiting posts is necessary. The Saeima majority, as is 
known, had other ideas. But we will return again to this 
question, when the Saeima begins reviewing the proposed law on 
State Civil Service on its second reading. If there are no such 
limitations and a mechanism prepared for implementation, the 
state administration reform, about which much is being said, is 
also impossible. 
  [Egle] "For Fatherland and Freedom" is criticized for 
getting 
carried away with political "limitations" at a time when people 
are concerned with economic and social questions. 
  [Straume] The basis of state development is, after all, 
political issues. But our faction is also concerned with 
economic problems. Recently Roberts Zile returned from an 
assignment in Australia; he is a non-voting member of our 
faction's Economic Commission. There is a work group that is 
working also on the question of taxes. But we cannot come 
forward with our ideas right now because we have already 
experienced the governing coalition stealing the ideas of others 
and offering them as their own. 
  [Egle] Could you tell us specifically what you have 
accomplished in the legislative process? 
  [Straume] No one is permitted to loaf in our faction, 
everyone must do something. I could mention that I submitted 
about 20 proposals pertaining to the proposed law on city 
council, district council and township council elections, many 
of which were adopted. Thus, for example, the number of deputies 
in the Riga council was increased from 45 (as found in the 
proposed law) to 60. 
  [Egle] They say that your faction is almost the only one in 
the Saeima that does not have internal discord. Do you really 
not argue in your closed sessions? 
  [Straume] But that is why those are closed sessions, so that 
we can argue it out and afterwords come forward with one 
position. We truly strive to announce ourselves as a collective, 
and, if that succeeds, then we will be able to thank mainly 
Maris Grinblats, our faction chairman. 
  [Egle] You yourself feel good in the Saeima? 
  [Straume] Yes, and why not? But I hope that I never "get 
glued" to this chair. I have adapted to the environment, but I 
strive to mobilize myself, so that the routine does not become 
too pleasant. In my free moments I think about what has happened 
in the Saeima and I always remind myself why I came here.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Randers: "A Person Who Has Never Accepted </F>
Lies"] 
  [Text] The administration prepared a bill for 
yesterday's Saeima plenary session on the candidate already 
approved by the ruling coalition for the newly created position 
in the Cabinet of Ministers -- the naming of OLAFS BRUVERS, 
deputy of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) faction, as State 
Minister for Human Rights of the Judicial Ministry. 
  O. Bruvers explained to LAUKU AVIZE that the offer of the 
position of State Minister for Human Rights from the "Latvian 
Way" (LW) side was already presented to him last summer, right 
after the Cabinet of Ministers was established. Thus, it is in 
no way related to his frequent voting, as opposition deputy, for 
projects proposed by the LW, nor is it an attempt by the ruling 
coalition to gain a faithful voter for their side. Since the LW 
offer to become a member of the Cabinet of Ministers was made 
repeatedly to O. Bruvers, after prolonged conversations and 
meetings with the CDU faction deputies, he finally agreed to 
accept. 
  O. Bruvers was born in Riga in 1947 into a family of six 
children. His father was repressed for being a former German 
army legionnaire, and his mother worked as a medical nurse. 
Since childhood, Olafs was raised within the family in a strict 
Christian manner (the parents were Baptists). During his school 
years, he did not join any of the young "Lenin-type" 
organizations of that era. 
  After mandatory service in the army, Olafs wanted to enter 
the Riga Polytechnical Institute in 1973. But just at that time, 
he became interested in human rights in the USSR and abandoned 
his former wishes. He constantly listened to the "Voice of 
America", "BBC", and "Radio Svaboda", and was heavily influenced 
by the ideas of the Russian writer deported from the USSR, 
Solzhenitsyn (for example, passive resistance to the system of 
lies, not carrying flags in demonstrations, not shouting false 
slogans, etc.). He also studied history (there was a vast 
library at home, where he learned about the "Year of Terror"), 
and through self-education, learned a great deal about Latvia as 
an independent nation and its occupation. 
  Filled with the idealism of youth, together with his younger 
brother Pavils, who was studying at the Institute of Medicine, 
the two decided to fight against the USSR system of lies. At 
first, they wanted to write an open letter to "Soviet Youth", 
but to avoid being placed in an insane asylum, they changed 
their minds and, with the help of a questionnaire (in Latvian 
and Russian), they decide to learn the opinions of the 
citizenship of the empire. Out of 600 questionnaires mailed, 370 
were returned. As a result of their "independent activity", the 
Bruvers brothers ended up, not in an insane asylum, but in the 
basement of a KGB prison in the spring of 1974. The KGB agents 
could not believe that the brothers were not being encouraged to 
perform this anti-governmental activity by some Western 
"sponsor". Both were interrogated for three and one half months 
and sat in single-person cells. 
  Even today, O. Bruvers is very thankful to those Latvians 
living in the West who started the visible campaign for the 
"Olafs and Pavils" case, which was waged outside of USSR 
embassies abroad (among the active demonstrators were also the 
present-day Saeima deputies, the Pavlovskis brothers). Western 
politicians carefully followed the case of the Bruvers brothers 
and their court proceedings. Being quite aware of this fact, the 
Soviet Supreme Court gave the brothers an unbelievably "light" 
sentence: Olafs, as the elder, had to spend six months in a hard 
labor camp, while Pavils was expelled for a defined period of 
one year from the university. 
  In 1976, the entire Bruvers family, because it was "unfit to 
live in the USSR", was told by the USSR soviet authorities to 
emigrate. Political asylum was found in Germany and thus, the 
"anti-soviet element", O. Bruvers ended up in Bonn. O. Bruvers 
established a family of his own in Germany, and later moved to 
the United States, where he lived until July of 1993, when he 
returned to his homeland as a deputy of the Saeima. 
  Because of his heroic actions during his youth, O. Bruvers 
is 
now considered to be a dissident*. He believes himself to be a 
centrist in politics. And in his political activities, even 
until the present, he has never agreed with nor has been 
influenced by lies. In the United States, O. Bruvers studied 
English (he is also fluent in conversational Russian and 
German), earning a degree in Doctor of Sciences in diplomatic 
sciences. His occupation in his country of residence was working 
in the experimental laboratory of a semi-conductor plant. 
  O. Bruvers admits that he is not entirely clear as to what 
the job in his new position will involve. The new state minister 
feels that human rights must be guaranteed fully to all 
inhabitants of the nation. Therefore, he first 
intends to listen to the problems of the entire group of 
inhabitants of Latvia, because, until now, the administration 
has not had an intensive conversation nor a serious exchange of 
information with the non-Latvian audience, and 
second, he feels it is essential to immediately 
initiate the defense of Latvian interests in international 
organizations against falsehoods and lies about violation of 
human rights measures in our nation. 
  * Dissident (dissidens, dissidentis in Latin) -- a person 
who 
does not agree with, nor recognizes the ruling points of view, 
is not afraid to state his point of view and to speak out in 
opposition.

<F P=106> [Article by Valdis Francs: "New Director of Citizenship and </F>
Immigration Department Appointed"] 
  [Text] Riga, March 8. Today, the Cabinet of Ministers of 
the Republic of Latvia appointed Ints Zitars, former head of the 
information center of the Citizenship and Immigration Department 
(CID), as director of the CID. 
  I. Zitars, in his former position, has shown himself to be 
an 
able organizer. An important prerequisite was that the new 
department chief should come from this very department, and thus 
be familiar with its major problems, according to Normunds 
Belskis, Press Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as 
told to DIENA. 
  Since the removal from office of the former department 
chief, 
Maris Plavnieks, the department was being run by his deputy, 
Peteris Zviedris. 
  Ints Zitars was born in 1944, and is Latvian. He graduated 
from the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the University 
of Latvia in 1970. From 1970 to 1978, he worked in the 
experimental semi-conductor laboratory in the University of 
Latvia as junior scientific associate. From 1978 to 1992, he was 
at the Solid-State Physics Institute of the University of Latvia 
as junior scientific associate, then senior engineer. From 1992 
until his appointment as director of the CID, he worked as the 
head of the CID information center.

<F P=106> [Interview of Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs by Valdis </F>
Bekeris: "We Issued the Laws Ourselves and We Must Put Them Into 
Order Ourselves"] 
  [Text] The complaining about disorganized legislation 
right now in Latvia is heard even more, perhaps, than the 
complaining about the bad conditions in the years of communist 
power. What hampered the Republic of Latvia's Supreme Council 
and what hampers the Saeima in finally bringing to legislation? 
Do we really have a deceiving Republic of Latvia and a deceiving 
Saeima, as a few loud and angry people now conclude? Perhaps 
Latvia really should be transformed from a parliamentary 
republic to a presidential republic, as a larger, but more 
moderate group of people think. Is a single and guaranteed 
correct answer to such questions even possible? Leaving the 
answers to them to each reader, RIGAS BALSS inquired of the 
Saeima chairman, Anatolijs GORBUNOVS, about the process, 
procedures and backstage events in the formation of laws. 
  [Bekeris] So, could a critical period arise that the Saeima 
becomes unnecessary and "undefendable" from the inhabitants of 
Latvia and even in the view of its own citizen's interests? 
  [Gorbunovs] I think that in the near future that will not 
happen. Yes, ignoring the critical attitude toward the 
parliament or toward the way in which the parliament operates, 
or toward individual deputies or factions, I think that the 
public does understand that the parliament is a mechanism for 
realizing and regulating public interests with the help of laws, 
so that conflicts can be resolved and compromises can be found. 
If the parliament is regularly democratically renewed then it 
will more or less reflect society itself. It is a mechanism in 
which citizens can realize their goals or also select 
representatives who express their interests and there must, of 
course, be such a place where the interests of citizens can be 
harmonized. International experience has not discovered anything 
better than a parliament. Of course with different emphases, 
different functions, but the basic idea is the same. In the 
developed world this thought and form appeared around the year 
1600, that is, in the 17th century. 
  [Bekeris] Do you directly, as the Saeima chairman, have the 
right to initiate legislation? Does it seem to you that the 
Saeima responds with sufficient sensitivity to all of our 
conflicting life courses? 
  [Gorbunovs] I have the same right to initiate legislation as 
any other deputy, but to do so four more deputies are needed, 
for the constitution stipulates that a legislative initiative 
must have five deputies. If five deputies submit a proposed law, 
then the Saeima reviews it. 
  But regarding the response and recall of conflicting and 
actual life processes, that is a very complicated question. 
Legislators are criticized because we do not have laws 
appropriate to one or another of life's fields and regarding 
various economic or social processes, which would advance 
reforms. And this criticism has some basis. Occasionally it does 
indeed sound very simplistic, as if by adopting a few laws or 
amendments all problems could be resolved. 
  In fact things in essence are that now all areas of life, 
all 
economic and social processes must be reformed and that must all 
be reflected in laws. And here we must have whole legislative 
blocs. Of course, to work out laws conceptually and then to 
polish them juridically requires a large and vast job. We are, 
unfortunately, missing a professional apparatus of clerks as 
foreign parliaments have, who have worked for many years and 
have an accepted procedure for their competitive placement. 
  In addition, the situation in Latvia is too complicated to 
permit simply adopting all of Europe's best legislation. We, 
first of all, must take into account everything that has gone on 
until now, Latvia's legislation in the 1920's and 1930's, for 
that was the basis for the development of the Latvian state. 
Then nationalization. Also the system created in the Soviet 
period: Soviet judicial and socialist economic relations. The 
results of colonization and occupation. And the current task is 
to renew everything at the same time and also to transform based 
on the principle of a law-based and democratic state. In 
addition there is the property question, relations between 
former owners and the current users of property, taking into 
account the mass deportations and emigration of the 1940's, 
mainly among Latvians, largely reducing it to a national 
question. 
  I sometimes think that if we, with our current legislative 
experience only now began to take on reform then indeed.... On 
the other hand, how would we have gotten this experience 
otherwise? 
  [Bekeris] Do the mass media--the press, TV, radio--influence 
the legislative process? Is such influence even desireable and, 
if you acknowledge it, then how does it manifest itself? 
  [Gorbunovs] Of course the mass media have quite broad 
opportunities to influence deputies and that must be done. Often 
such influence is indirect, for radio and television do not 
literally discuss various amendments or changes in editing laws. 
Of course the press, TV and radio influence legislation 
conceptually, for every law or amendment to a law is a political 
fact, it is an instrument to realize a concrete policy. And in 
analyzing specific policies or Saeima faction doctrines, 
expressing the arguments "for" or "against," along with that the 
press, TV and radio bring pressure on political parties, on 
factions, and that is either support or a position of opposition 
and, if this position truly is argued, analyzed, then it 
definitely influences the legislative process positively. 
  [Bekeris] How does the "Saeima Mail" function, which 
receives 
complaints and suggestions from inhabitants? Do the appropriate 
[Saeima] commissions have a mutual contact with these 
correspondences? 
  [Gorbunovs] There is a suggestions bureau, a suggestions 
commission. These suggestions are analyzed and categorized, and, 
of course, the commissions also strive to answer concrete 
letters. Suggestions of a general nature are copied and 
distributed to all factions. But in our election system and 
deputies' responsibilities, the link with voters also has its 
problems, for voters vote for parties and it is clear that in a 
proportional representation system, from which district each 
deputy is elected, but this clarity does not reach beyond 
Kurzeme, Vidzeme, Latgale and Zemgale. Deputies in other, 
foreign parliaments have already told us that this proportional 
system cannot long survive, that it is a transitional period 
system and until now it still exists in Italy, but it is now 
being fixed there too, for the ideal is that each deputy has an 
electoral district. In return for a mixed system, both 
majoritarian and proportional, where a deputy is responsible to 
his party, he has also an electoral district, in which there is 
a direct bond with the voters and responsibility to the voters. 
That, of course, is more effective. 
  About letters. If a letter is written to me personally, then 
I also strive to respond to all of those who have written me. 
But sometimes these letters are addressed to the Saeima, 
including only my surname or post--Saeima Chairman--then I 
address them to all factions. Some letters, which are 
particularly urgent, we copy and distribute to all deputies, 
although they are not addressed to them. In their speeches 
deputies often cite voter letters. 
  [Bekeris] Did the activity of the earlier Supreme Council 
disturb the influence of the so-called lobbyists and is 
something similar sensed right now? 
  [Gorbunovs] Lobbyists personally do not come to me, but that 
does not mean that deputies do not sense lobbyists. Here we 
should analyze what this lobbying is, for I conceive of lobbying 
as political pressure, which is brought by one or another social 
group in defending its interests, and that is completely 
acceptable; without normal lobbying the parliament cannot even 
function. But it is very important that deputies see beyond 
these interests to the context of the interests of the whole 
society, or else he, too, turns into a narrow lobbyist. Since we 
have been working for only less than a year, it seems to me that 
deputies have not yet become connected to narrow lobbying. It 
does show up occasionally, but it has not been so awful. When 
the Supreme Council completed its work this lobbying was more 
pronounced. 
  [Bekeris] How does the work of the Supreme Council chairman 
differ from your current work as Saeima chairman? 
  [Gorbunovs] My situation has changed significantly. Working 
as the Supreme Council chairman I "smoothed out" many things 
during sessions, right in the meeting hall. Now my task is not 
to smooth out conflict, but rather to give deputies equal 
opportunities so that they can always depend on the fact that 
their wishes will be correctly and consistently observed. If 
some deputy today is refused on some procedural question, then 
he knows that his political oppenent will be just as correctly 
refused next time, and that is one of the chief fundamental 
rules for the normal functioning of the parliament. As soon as 
deputies feel injustice, unfruitful discussions of procedure 
begin. In terms of procedural issues the Saeima chairman adopts 
very few rules by himself. 
  In return his rights as a deputy do not become limited. He 
may participate in debates, vote, work as a member of a Saeima 
commission, and also he may stand in for the President in the 
absence of the President. 
  As a member of the team, feeling complete responsibility for 
the work of "Latvia's Way," [LW] I actively work in the "LW" 
faction and coalition, and also on the Economic Commission. 
Leading plenary sessions requires me to be objective and 
tolerant toward all viewpoints, but after surviving a few 
faction and commission sessions I yielded to subjective emotions. 
  [Bekeris] Do you see a possibility that the governing 
coalition will be able to draw in other Saeima factions and 
deputies? 
  [Gorbunovs] First, people will want to evaluate the results 
of what we are doing and how we are doing it in a longer time 
frame. Another thing, that there must be a mutual connection 
between the voters and responsibility. That must happen through 
party members, but I think in any event that forced party 
development in the near term will not happen, not within 
"Latvia's Way," nor anywhere else. 
  Are we thinking about expanding the political union? It is 
doubtful that that would happen in the near term. "Latvia's Way" 
is open to political dialogue on this question. But two 
conditions must be taken into account here. First, that other 
parties would gladly find themselves in opposition for a while 
and not connect themselves with the governing coalition, for 
that would also mean accepting responsibility for mistakes and 
for the fact that much has not yet been achieved. Second, the 
minority government formed by "Latvia's Way" and the Agrarian 
Union, not having achieved a majority in the parliament, causes 
it to work very carefully and to keep together, accepting full 
responsibility, and that, perhaps, is also a basis for a certain 
stability. Whereas establishing a new union, expanding the 
existing one, or establishing a new coalition on a platform in 
which only individual program points are mutual, that would an 
unstable thing and that should not be done. 
  Whether that is normal or a coincidence, "Latvia's Way" and 
the Agrarian Union is developing a coalition whose place is in 
the center and to the right of center. The opposition is found 
on both the right and left wings. That is why it is practically 
not possible to develop a coalition government. That is not 
something for which blame should be assigned or which is to be 
wondered about. That would more readily look like 
irresponsibility or adventurism. That, it seems to me, 
opposition factions also understand, and--my conclusion may be 
in conflict with other conclusions expressed--that causes 
opposition factions also to be constructive, both in introducing 
legislation and various amendments and changes to laws, and in 
actively participating in discussions of proposed laws submitted 
by the government. That, in turn, sometimes causes indignation 
within the governing coalition, as they try simultaneously to 
maintain the capacity to do battle. 
  If there is no internal division within the faction, then, 
it 
seems to me, two scenarios are possible: Either "Latvia's Way" 
and the Agrarian Union of Latvia will honestly work to the end, 
together drinking the bitter herb, or there will be an early 
election for the Saeima.

<F P=106> [Article by Olli Ainola: "Baltic Policy: Arms Sale </F>
Restrictions Being Rescinded"] 
  [Text] Finland has changed the principles of its arms sale 
policy. Prevention of exports has been converted to promotion of 
exports. As its domestic sales are drying up, the defense 
industry is attempting to assure its survival through export 
sales. 
  A promising market is seen in the former Warsaw Pact 
countries, especially the Baltics, after Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the export control 
organization, makes changes in its structure this week. Finland 
is following other Western countries, including the United 
States, that have decided to rescind the arms export ban to 
those countries, even for combat aircraft. 
  The enthusiasm of Finnish arms plants for exporting to the 
Baltic countries has been held in check above all by the 
Paasikivi Doctrine [policy formulated by post-World War II 
President J.K. Paasikivi according to which Finland should 
refrain from actions displeasing to Moscow]. The foreign policy 
leadership has not wanted to provide export licenses for actual 
lethal weapons and equipment as long as there are Russian 
military units in the Baltic countries. 
  A couple of years ago, the Sako arms plant was denied a 
license to export 5,000 assault rifles to any of the three 
Baltic countries. According to officials, the application was 
purely a demonstration of intent, because it the document lacked 
end-user information, among other things. Sako said it had 
provided end-user information, and that the export sale was 
prevented for solely political reasons. 
  If Russian forces withdraw from the Baltic countries and the 
situation becomes stable, authorities promise to free the export 
of arms and combat equipment. Even after these conditions are 
met, however, licenses are going to be carefully considered, 
especially if a deal were to involve a political commitment to 
provide spare parts or resupply in event of crisis or war. 
  The first preview of the new policy may soon be seen. Finns 
have under discussion deals for final assembly work, selling 
components and raw materials to ammunition plants in Estonia and 
Latvia. The licenses officials are regarding these deals 
favorably.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee on </F>
Economic Policy of the State Duma, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent 
Timur Grigoryanets under the rubric "Viewpoint"; place and date 
not given: "The Time Has Come To Swallow Our Pride"] 
  [Text] Not so long ago a group of young politicians and 
scholars made a statement about the creation of the Russian 
patriotic movement People's Alliance, which analysts thought had 
a great future. 
  The authors of the document call for unification in order to 
save the self-respect of Russia and Russians, in order to prove 
that the ideas of patriotism and democracy are inseparable, in 
order through common efforts to prevent the final collapse of 
the state, the degradation of the economy, and the return to 
authoritarianism. 
  "We consider it a primary task to form a policy and strategy 
of national reconciliation...we are convinced that the key to 
national reconciliation could be the idea of citizenship, the 
idea of the good of our common and unified state. The time has 
come to swallow our pride and our claims to the only and always 
correct truth." 
  The majority of the initiators of the creation of the new 
social movement are members of parliament of the preceding and 
present convocations and are, as they say, politicians of the 
"third wave." For them, who already have post-perestroyka 
political experience, the primacy of the law over personal and 
group ambitions is the basic moral principle for their activity. 
  The authors of the statement have appealed to their allies 
and sympathizers in the capital and in the regions, where they 
are now forming local People's Alliance structures: "We are 
asking everyone who cares about the fate of Russia to support 
our initiative." 
  The statement was signed by the following: S. Glazyev, A. 
Golovin, V. Yermakov, A. Krasnov, V. Menshov, V. Mironenko, I. 
Muravyev, D. Olyshanskiy, S. Polozkov, O. Rumyantsev, V. 
Sokolov, A. Fedorov, A. Tsipko, A. Chilingarov, and others. 
  One of the document's authors is the chairman of the 
Committee on Economic Policy of the State Duma, S.Yu. Glazyev. 
He is 33 years old, he was born in Zaporozhye, he graduated from 
Moscow State University in economics and then worked at the 
Central Economics and Mathematical Institute of the Academy of 
Science, he is a doctor of economic sciences, beginning in 1991 
he worked in the government structures of Russia, and in 
1992-1993 he was the minister of foreign economic relations. 
Today S.Yu. Glazyev responds to questions from DELOVOY MIR 
correspondent Timur Grigoryanets. 
  [Grigoryanets] Sergey Yuryevich, among the recent political 
documents public attention has been drawn to the message from 
the president to the Federal Assembly. I would like to know your 
opinion of this document first of all. 
  [Glazyev] This message contains a description of the main 
points of the state's economic and social policy for this year. 
The Duma has attentively discussed the message and responded 
positively to its main ideas. 
  This pertains above all to the idea of conducting a more 
balanced and reasonable economic policy and the point that the 
reforms must not be conducted to the detriment of the people or 
be accompanied by their impoverishment. It is important that we 
first formulate a provision on the social cost of the reforms 
and devote a great deal of attention to questions of structural 
policy and the need to retain our scientific-industrial 
potential. That is, the Duma was pleasantly surprised by how 
balanced, reasonable, and constructive the message was. 
  [Grigoryanets] Does this assessment apply also to the draft 
budget submitted by the government recently for consideration in 
the State Duma? 
  [Glazyev] Unfortunately, no. In general one gets the 
impression that the people who prepared the budget did not read 
the president's message. The budget is practically in no way 
linked to the basic directions of the economic policy formulated 
in the presidential document. After discussion in a work group 
of the Committee on Economic Policy we came to the conclusion 
that, in the first place, the macroeconomic prognosis on which 
the construction of the budget is based is unreliable and, in 
the second place, the goal of the economic policy contained in 
the draft budget does not correspond to the goals formulated in 
the president's message, with the exception, perhaps, of the 
goal of reducing inflation to 7-8 percent by the end of the 
year. But even today it is obvious that events in the economy 
will not develop the way predicted in the budget, and if we 
execute it we risk hyperinflation by the end of the year. This 
will be a result of the sharp decline of production which, 
according to our estimates, could reach 25-30 percent, and the 
figures for the first quarter confirm this. This means that the 
revenue part of the budget will not be fulfilled and there will 
be more manipulations with sequestering of budget expenditures, 
which will introduce even more chaos into the economy. As a 
result, we will inevitably end up in a situation with a very 
large budget deficit and, as a result, extremely high inflation 
growing into hyperinflation. Nor does the budget fully 
correspond to the program of the government itself. That is, the 
president's message is like a thing unto itself, the government 
program is a thing unto itself, and the budget message is some 
kind of third reality which is poorly linked to the first two. 
And that is not even to mention the fact that in reality 
everything proceeds according to some fourth scenario. 
  If we turn to the structural part of the budget and analyze 
the priorities found in it, we discover that of the several key 
branches to be supported in the government program, namely food, 
the fuel and energy complex, conversion, transportation, and the 
social sphere, in reality it is proposed that real resources be 
provided only for the agro-industrial and fuel-energy complexes. 
Actually science-intensive industry, which is the basis and the 
main reserve for reconstruction and economic growth throughout 
the world, and in our country as well, could simply cease to 
exist this year. We have already started to lose certain 
promising technologies; as we were able to determine from the 
results of parliamentary hearings two weeks ago, the list of 
them amounts to several dozen. These are irreversible losses, 
and yet many of these technologies could compose a basis for our 
economic advancement. We must not console ourselves with 
illusions--no boom in the raw materials sector of the economy 
can bring the entire country out of the crisis. We need 
modernization, renewal of fixed capital, we must realize the 
great potential that is concentrated in science-intensive 
industry. Unfortunately, the priorities designated by the 
president in his message and the priorities actually reflected 
in the structure of the budget do not correspond to one another. 
To continue to follow this same track is not simply imprudent, 
it would be insane. 
  [Grigoryanets] And what is your committee's verdict? 
  [Glazyev] The work group of the Committee on Economic Policy 
is inclined to suggest that the government join forces in order 
to develop a new budget that corresponds to the president's 
message and reasonable economic policy aimed at solving the real 
problems of overcoming the economic crisis. 
  [Grigoryanets] You and the experts have done a large amount 
of work during the course of studying the government draft of 
the budget. And what are your proposals in this connection? 
  [Glazyev] I think that today we have no other way out than 
to 
begin to develop a realistic economic program for this year and 
future years. I would like to emphasize that it must be based on 
a reliable economic prognosis. The estimate of the threat to our 
economy, which has already entered into a process of 
catastrophic destruction, must be realistic as well. We also 
need a prognosis of structural changes and any valuation of the 
reserves we have at our disposal. On this basis it would be 
possible to clearly formulate realistic goals and means of 
achieving them, to prepare the corresponding system of measures, 
and to build the budget on this. I think that this work could be 
done in a month. If we concentrate forces and work 
together--both the Federal Assembly and the government. This is 
our common cause, we together are responsible for the quality of 
the policy that is conducted and for the results that are 
achieved. 
  [Grigoryanets] What will it take to do this well-arranged 
work quickly? After all, it is already April.... 
  [Glazyev] Perhaps we do not have the political will to 
recognize that the economic policy being conducted today is not 
adequate to the real interests of the country in overcoming the 
crisis and resuming the growth of national well-being. For our 
part, we have already begun this work; the first meetings of the 
group of experts took place last week. 
  [Grigoryanets] In what ways are you close and attracted to 
the people with whom you presented the initiative to create a 
new social movement? 
  [Glazyev] I have known them for a long time as responsible, 
honest, and purposeful politicians for whom the good of the 
country and national interests are the real meaning of political 
work. I think that the initiators of this movement could create 
the concentration of creative efforts, the impulse in the organs 
of power and among influential sociopolitical movements, 
especially in the regions, which could finally help society move 
in the direction of emerging from the crisis. The group of 
people who initiated the creation of People's Alliance includes 
specialists in the area of social policy, in the area of 
regional policy, local self-government, and many other key 
areas. My role is to coordinate and organize the work on the 
economic program questions, and we have already begun to do this. 
  [Grigoryanets] That is, you have decided to create your own 
economic program? 
  [Glazyev] In our country we have now entered a situation 
where it is time to ask ourselves the question: "If not we, then 
who?" For three months we have been waiting for the program for 
the government, we have been waiting for certain realistic 
measures from the structures of executive power, we have given 
suggestions, we have sent proposals, but no reasonable actions 
are taking place, and we are rolling toward an abyss like 
lunatics. In spite of the fact that we do not yet have 
sufficient possibilities of forming a realistic policy, we think 
that we must exert all efforts to introduce reasonable and 
constructive principles into all spheres of life. And I think we 
have sufficient intellectual resources and skilled personnel for 
such an initiative to work. 
  [Grigoryanets] Do you think that we still have a chance of 
bringing our economy and our country out of the process of 
disintegration in a civilized way? 
  [Glazyev] I think we have that chance right now. For perhaps 
the only positive result of recent months was that the majority 
of our politicians and organizations represented in parliament 
and the structures of executive power have recognized that we 
are indeed entering a process of uncontrollable catastrophic 
destruction of our economy and our society. And a reflection of 
this understanding was the adoption of the Duma of the 
"memorandum on accord" and then the president's initiative on 
the preparation of the Agreement on the Achievement of Civil 
Peace in Russia. Today we see a sincere desire on the part of 
practically all factions in the State Duma and many workers of 
systems of executive power to develop a policy that would be 
acceptable to the people and would be realized to the good of 
the country from the standpoint of overcoming the crisis, 
restoring industrial growth, and restoring Russia's position as 
a great scientific and industrial power. The process of 
consultations, roundtables, exchange of opinions, and search for 
agreement on the main directions of our socioeconomic policy 
that has begun gives us a real chance of developing a program 
that would receive broad support and around which all 
constructive forces of society could rally. Today only the 
government has in no way indicated its attitude toward 
initiatives on agreement from the Federal Assembly and the 
president, but I hope that our criticism of the budget message 
and our proposals for improving it will evoke such an action. 
Because we cannot but see that behind the wasteful consumption 
and the flourishing of a limited number of firms and individual 
branches, behind all this we cannot but see the colossal 
impoverishment of the entire country.

<F P=106> [Interview with former KGB Chairman Vadim Bakatin by Yuriy </F>
Shchekochikhin; place and date not given: "Lubyanka: The Fantasy 
and the Reality"] 
  [Text] [Shchekochikhin] Vadim Viktorovich, you are indeed 
called the destroyer of the KGB, although you were its chairman 
for a very short period of time... 
  [Bakatin] I do not know how I should feel about this label. 
On one hand, I may be proud that I am one of those who broke the 
pillar of the party-state system. Because the KGB (like its 
predecessors) served that system and ensured its security--first 
and foremost, of course, that of the Politburo. Although 
officially all this was presented as "defending the Motherland." 
And if I indeed destroyed this system, it means I was moving 
with the flow of historic trends... But I cannot accept the 
honor of such credit... 
  The KGB is a rudiment of the past. And in the past there 
were 
completely different rules of the game; first and foremost, 
these rules included control over thought. Now all of this has 
collapsed! Not the KGB, but the system which, I repeat, the KGB 
served. It collapsed not because a villain named Bakatin came on 
the scene--the system, of which the KGB was part, lost the game 
of history. 
  I came, however, with the firm conviction that the special 
service should not be disbanded or shut down like any other 
ministry. We cannot leave ourselves without special services, 
especially at such a turning point in history as we are at now. 
How can a nuclear state exist without a special service? Have we 
already reached a universal treaty on the all-out banning of 
special services' activities? Therefore, I did not intend to rid 
the service of all professionals and hire people from the street 
on the basis of being "democrats" or "bearded..." 
  I saw my task not as destroying the KGB but first and 
foremost reforming it. 
  [Shchekochikhin] What did the word "reform" mean for us 
then, 
after the August putsch? 
  [Bakatin] First and foremost, destroying the KGB monopoly... 
In the United States there are 18 or 20 special services, and 
the functions of many of them are absolutely incomprehensible 
for us: For instance, protection of the U.S. President is 
carried out by the Treasury Department. This means that I had to 
see to dismemberment of the KGB. This is one. Second. At the 
time there was hope that a new Union would be formed; could, for 
instance, Kravchuk allow Moscow to have special services in 
Kiev? Therefore it was necessary to set up an interrepublic 
service that would carry out the functions the republics 
themselves would want it to: special equipment, cadre training, 
information support... Both were fairly easy to accomplish. I 
remember how on my only second day Leonid Shebarshin came to me 
with a proposal to separate the First Chief Directorate--that 
is, foreign intelligence--from the KGB, and this was quite 
logical. In the entire world, intelligence and 
counterintelligence are antipodes, competitors... 
  [Shchekochikhin] Just recently the same Leonid Shebarshin 
said in an interview that you were reorganizing the KGB with 
methods typical of a party obkom [oblast committee] secretary... 
  [Bakatin] But I am in fact the product of that system, 
although I am happy that it did not break me. Perhaps because 
before entering party work I worked for 13 years in 
construction... But of course, I have since my obkom days 
retained an intolerance for the viewpoint of others, a lack of 
listening skills. As to rudeness--this is a legacy of working at 
a construction site. So perhaps Shebarshin is right in some 
respects... Although I do not know what it was he did not like. 
He was one of the few people I relied on during my early days in 
the KGB. He was the most democratic of all those I 
encountered... He is probably holding a grudge because when it 
was necessary to make personnel changes in intelligence I 
appointed one of the deputies against his wishes. This was 
actually the pretext for his resignation... 
  [Shchekochikhin] Vadim Viktorovich, despite the fact that 
current FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] officers are 
not particularly fond of you, even they say that the food in the 
Lubyanka cafeteria improved perceptibly during your time, 
because you ate your meals there instead of in a special 
executive room... 
  [Bakatin] I do not know... Do not remember... I did drop in 
there, and scolded them for poor service... But I did not even 
have enough time to become familiar with all the Lubyanka 
corridors... I only remember that people complained about the 
cold, the worn out linoleum... But this is something the head of 
any agency hears. 
  As to people not being fond of me, it is not at all because 
I 
fired some or other person; no! For some, I was first and 
foremost an ideological enemy! I said from the very first day: 
"We have to get rid of the chekist attitude just like we are 
getting rid of Bolshevism. Let us turn an ideologized special 
service serving one party into a nonpartisan special service." 
This is what many did not like. 
  I want to repeat that I was not destroying the KGB as a 
special service. Do you know who was truly destroying it? 
Russian extremists, who after August 1991 strived to pull 
everything under Russia but in reality, while leaving everything 
as it had been, simply replace the sign "USSR KGB" with "RSFSR 
KGB." I can guarantee that this would have been the entire 
extent of the reform. This is what I was not about to allow to 
happen; by the way, Ivanenko supported me. And Boris Yeltsin, 
too... At least in the beginning. 
  Yes, I was working in an environment of confrontation with 
the Russian KGB. It was there--not at Ivanenko's level but at 
the level of his deputies--that our cadres were continuously 
enticed into coming over to them. Naturally, such artificial 
antagonism demoralized the cadres. 
  Still, the most difficult part then was something 
else--changing the internal content of special services' work. 
  When I came to the KGB I saw different people there. Some 
were too smart to sincerely believe in the idea that had died 
before we came on the scene. They simply pretended to believe in 
it. But there also were those who even now are still for 
Marxism-Leninism and are ready to hang those portraits on the 
wall again. By the way, they are still hanging in some offices... 
  [Shchekochikhin] Vadim Viktorovich, when you came to the KGB 
did you see that the thrust toward political surveillance was 
much stronger than that toward national security? 
  [Bakatin] The very concept of security was defined by two 
mottoes. In the external sphere--"struggle for peace," while we 
were building up our military might; in the domestic 
sphere--"purity of ranks," that is, protection of the party 
oligarchy. Gorbachev liquidated the system with one single 
action: by uttering the word "pluralism." It was enough to say 
that one could think differently from Marx and Lenin--and 
everything collapsed. It turned out that the very idea was 
stillborn. 
  For the KGB, security meant first and foremost suppression 
of 
dissent, and therefore of course, political surveillance was the 
predominant area of its work. 
  [Shchekochikhin] But you are accused of liquidating not only 
the Fifth--ideological--Directorate, but also during your time 
professionals who had never been involved in ideology also began 
to leave: specialists on combating crime, smuggling, espionage... 
  [Bakatin] Well, regarding departures... There was 
Stepashin's 
commission, our own internal commission, which was engaged in 
sorting out who did what during the putsch... And I have to say 
that I fired considerably fewer people than the chekists 
themselves advised me to. For instance, Border Troops Commander 
in Chief Kalinichenko: It was suggested to me that I fire him 
just because he gave an order during the days of the putsch to 
put the border troops on heightened alert... I did not even fire 
many generals, although some I probably should have... 
  As to the middle, let alone the lower, level, I did not 
touch 
it at all. On my second day on the job I issued an address to 
all personnel, which said that "there will be no hunt for 
scapegoats..." 
  Because no matter what, the KGB had good specialists. It is 
not accidental that they are now in such demand--look at any 
bank or major company... 
  [Shchekochikhin] And what about those dealing directly with 
suppression of crime? Did they stay? 
  [Bakatin] The way the KGB was combating crime was often a 
mere duplication of militia efforts. Remember how under 
Kryuchkov KGB personnel were put into the so-called suppression 
of economic sabotage, which placed its personnel in the position 
of counting jars in stores? They themselves laughed at it and 
asked one another when they would be issued militia whistles. 
The business of a special service is to combat international 
terrorism, drugs... 
  When I was minister of internal affairs I wrote a memorandum 
containing a proposal to take the entire crime-combating line 
out of the KGB and create an replica of the FBI; that is, I 
wanted to liquidate the duplication between the KGB and the MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs]. In his edict of December 1991 
Boris Yeltsin merged the MVD and the KGB (this was after 
Barannikov's appointment)... An edict which he signed at the 
airport (as he was departing for Rome) and he repealed several 
days later. 
  [Shchekochikhin] I remember that we put a lot of effort then 
into finding out where this edict came from, and never did find 
out... We took a tough stance then against creating such a 
monster... 
  [Bakatin] And you were wrong... You were looking at the KGB 
from the old, Soviet perspective... In those, Soviet conditions 
this could not be permitted under any circumstances... But when 
a society enters a period of democracy, this would have both 
strengthened security and liquidated the KGB as the KGB. When 
the KGB was stripped of its main task--suppression of 
dissent--they started looking for things to keep it busy... 
Kryuchkov came up with sabotage. Bakatin came and said: Let us 
tackle organized crime... That is, we were cutting one sphere 
and strengthening another so that we had at least something to 
do. Otherwise, who needs you? Had this merge taken place, it 
would be like this: counterintelligence--Stepashin; 
intelligence--Primakov; and Yerin, who is responsible for 
combating crime. 
  [Shchekochikhin] But in the same United States there is a 
good dozen organizations combating crime; this is done first and 
foremost in order to reduce corruption inside the special 
services... As to our environment, I want to repeat that 
concentrating all mafia-combating efforts under the same roof 
will do no good. Not to mention the fact that the concentration 
of enforcement structures under one command is asking for 
trouble. 
  [Bakatin] It is only dangerous when there is no law, no 
control... When there is a power vacuum; when one can blast 
apart the parliament... When chaos reigns... 
  [Shchekochikhin] But we are talking about one and the same 
thing! 
  [Bakatin] I do not know now how the FCS and the MVD will 
divide the business of combating organized crime... 
  [Shchekochikhin] It also amazed me in the past, too, that 
MVD 
and KGB reports presented the same facts of suppression of 
crime, and it was not clear who in fact had conducted the 
operations... 
  [Bakatin] But this is precisely how it was! Routinely! I 
remember, when I was the minister of internal affairs indignant 
subordinates used to come in, waving the newspaper: "See, the 
KGB has again taken credit for our operation... But it only 
helped us at the last stage...". 
  [Shchekochikhin] When you came to the KGB, did you see that 
the crime-combating capability there was weaker than in the MVD? 
  [Bakatin] Not weaker... It is just that they had fewer 
people 
by two orders of magnitude than the MVD... But while you have 
more militia, you also have more corruption... Although, of 
course, the KGB is a privileged system which in principle was 
not particularly involved in combating organized crime... But 
the KGB's technical services are undoubtedly much stronger. It 
is like day and night as compared to the militia. 
  [Shchekochikhin] Vadim Viktorovich, there are persistent 
rumors that before your appointment, the KGB archives were being 
destroyed on a massive scale... 
  [Bakatin] The KGB archives were nevertheless in good shape. 
Yes, one can destroy materials in the archive, but some trail 
nevertheless remains. At the very least a protocol of 
incineration... Take for instance the Sakharov file... Kryuchkov 
destroyed the Sakharov file--which consisted of many 
volumes--but a trail remained nevertheless... The documents 
associated with the putsch, however--coded cables, directives, 
orders that had been kept in desks or personal safes--there was 
an attempt to destroy these documents, and some were destroyed 
in order to cover tracks. I knew it, and my first directive 
was... Also erroneous, by the way... 
  [Shchekochikhin] What was it? 
  [Bakatin] I forbade the release of anything whatsoever from 
the archives. 
  [Shchekochikhin] I asked M.S. Gorbachev, when he was still 
president, whether he was afraid of the KGB... He replied that 
he knew its might all too well... When you were a big party 
bureaucrat, were you afraid of the KGB? 
  [Bakatin] And what kind of might did the KGB have? Had it 
been strong enough at least to ensure the security of the system 
it served, nothing would have happened... After all, the KGB has 
not been able to save the system--so what might is this?.. 
  [Shchekochikhin] So you were not afraid of the KGB? 
  [Bakatin] No... I had many friends who worked there, for 
instance, in Kemerovo... 
  [Shchekochikhin] But when I asked M.S. Gorbachev whether 
they 
were listening on him here, in the Kremlin, he replied: "Who in 
hell knows?.." That was the president of a huge country... 
  [Bakatin] Maybe they were in fact listening... 
  [Shchekochikhin] What about you--were you not afraid when 
you 
worked in the obkom that somebody was listening? 
  [Bakatin] I was not, and I am not now. Even if they are 
listening right now, as we sit and talk here at LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA. I do not give a damn... I know that those who should be 
afraid are those who are conceiving something bad... That I am 
critical of this system, I never hid and am not hiding now... 
  [Shchekochikhin] What surprised you in the KGB? Something 
you 
never suspected they were doing? 
  [Bakatin] I have to admit that I came there as an 
outsider... 
And, of course, I did not know many things... Naturally, people 
took advantage of this... 
  [Shchekochikhin] How did you figure that out? 
  [Bakatin] I ask: Bring me the Sakharov file. I am told: "We 
have never had a file on Sakharov," that is, a man is lying 
through his teeth. I tell him: "You are lying!," and he tells 
me: "I am too old to lie..." So I had to replace the chief of 
archives, and only then not only did the act of the archive 
destruction surface but also some bits and pieces of the file 
itself... 
  [Shchekochikhin] That is, if they wanted to hide something 
from you, they could? 
  [Bakatin] Naturally. I repeat: I was an outsider coming into 
a tightly knit corporation... Speaking of what surprised me, 
though, it was this. I had thought in the past that the KGB at 
least was efficient and well-organized in terms of information 
collection. It turned out that this was a myth. In the past it 
always surprised me that for any session or meeting, papers were 
brought to Kryuchkov by suitcase, and he sat and did something 
with them... When I myself saw these papers, I discovered to my 
surprise that almost all these papers were flak--that is, they 
contained things any normal person could learn the day before 
from the newspapers. Of everything I was given to look at, only 
one-hundredth was of interest. This part came mainly from 
electronic intercepts. Therefore, the surprise was that this 
huge system was doing nothing of consequence. I remember, 
Aleksandr Nikolayevich Yakovlev told me how, when he was an 
ambassador, he helped one chekist earn an order--he gave him a 
telephone book... 
  [Shchekochikhin] I was amazed at the trifles KGB agents were 
engaged in... I cannot forget how one secret informer told me 
that he received his 30 rubles (literally 30!) for reporting on 
his coworker--that the latter was reading "Lolita..." Did you 
discover that this system, on which the KGB rested, also was 
wasting effort? 
  [Bakatin] I agree, except that the number of KGB agents also 
is being exaggerated... 
  [Shchekochikhin] You are probably tired of this question... 
But still... The main accusation against you was that you 
revealed the entire system of surveillance in the American 
Embassy building... 
  [Bakatin] You of all people should know that this entire 
system was uncovered by the Americans at the beginning of the 
1980's, and as early as 1982 at a Politburo meeting the decision 
was made to scrap this system as completely blown. This building 
was standing there like a monument to the cold war! Especially 
considering that this surveillance system was created in 1976 
and has long become obsolete. 
  [Shchekochikhin] But I recently read myself in a newspaper 
that by doing this you blew our agent network in Finland, since 
this is where these bugs were being put into concrete blocks! 
  [Bakatin] This was done not in Finland but in Russia... I 
even know where... But I will not tell... What we declassified 
then had long been no secret for the Americans. All right, they 
outwitted us then, so what? The best thing was to openly admit 
it... The clamor began afterwards... When I had left the KGB... 
It is our tradition--a kick from behind as one leaves... 
  [Shchekochikhin] Vadim Viktorovich, in your opinion, did the 
KGB have something to do with the creation of Zhirinovskiy's 
image? 
  [Bakatin] Well, let us look at it this way... There was only 
one CPSU--and it had one special service... The time of 
pluralism came, and it had to ensure that this pluralism would 
not run wild... Therefore, theoretically the KGB could have 
something to do with it in order to somehow counterbalance the 
emerging democratic movement... I have no definite knowledge of 
this, however.

<F P=106> [Report by DEN Analytical Center: "Baturin Is Against </F>
Counterintelligence"] 
  [Text] From the report "Political Technologists in a 
Systems Crisis" prepared by the DEN Analytical Center. 
  The events of the first half of March 1994, and most of all 
the subject of the so-called "state coup" and the "introduction 
of a state of emergency," are indicative of the severe 
exacerbation of contradictions in the present political 
establishment and the beginning of practical preparations by 
various groups for the post-Yeltsin period... 
  Despite his degradation as a political figure (for reasons 
of 
personal health and intellectual incompetence), Yeltsin 
nevertheless continues to play an important role in the existing 
political structure: He is a deterrent to influential political 
groups, preventing them from starting a ruthless "showdown" 
among themselves. 
  ...The main principle of such a game consists of the 
following: The weakest groups (or group) must persistently try 
to clash with key political forces in order to weaken them as 
much as possible. The increase in confrontation between the main 
opponents makes it possible for "weaklings" to intensify their 
influence by playing one against the other. The game becomes 
especially effective if the president himself is involved 
(directly or indirectly). 
  Taking Yeltsin's maniacal mistrustfulness into account, it 
would be rather simple to use him to play out such a maneuver... 
  ...Yuriy Baturin-- assistant to the president for 
national security. Adequate knowledge and experience in problems 
of national security lacking. Main characteristics as an 
individual: tenacious and good memory, manipulator ("Physical 
and Technology Institute"--self-determination) type of 
mentality, pragmatic cynicism, and political immorality. 
Extremely ambitious, but is able to conceal this. A sanguine 
introvert. Has a high indicator on the F-scale. Presence of 
complexes that are characteristic of a schizophrenic type of 
personality. 
  ...Baturin has a different status in the Kremlin structure 
that distinguishes him from Ilyushin and Sukhanov (Yeltsin's 
traditional inner circle), as well as from Filatov (who has 
support in the democratic environment). At the same time, Yu. 
Baturin uses the rivalry of Ilyushin and Filatov rather 
effectively. 
  Yu. Baturin's "brilliant" resourcefulness, which enabled him 
to acquire colossal influence over Yeltsin, who is becoming 
decrepit, was in linking the concept of "national security" with 
the concept of Yeltsin's "security." 
  Yu. Baturin took active part in preparation of the state 
coup 
in December 1992, worked on documents for the March coup (1993), 
and perfected the grievously known Edict No. 1400. He 
simultaneously reinforced his bureaucratic status. At the same 
time, Baturin, as a representative of an independent team, as 
before, is one of the weakest figures of the Russian political 
establishment. 
  Considering Yeltsin's traditional hatred for and fear of the 
KGB, Yu. Baturin prepared an edict on reformation of the FCS 
[Federal Counterintelligence Service], which was already on the 
president's desk in the Kremlin on 2 March. Nevertheless, 
Yeltsin signed a document on the assignment of S. Stepashin 
instead of N. Galushko as director of the FCS (according to some 
information, Filatov lobbied for Stepashin). 
  Literally on the second day, Baturin informed Yeltsin of the 
unsatisfactory work of the FCS, the lack of information from it 
that Yeltsin needs (although the last eight analytical documents 
from counterintelligence were held up on Baturin's desk). 
Simultaneously, he mentioned the negative attitude toward 
Yeltsin of a majority of FCS employees and reported on a speech 
being prepared by Skokov against Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin. 
  On 5 March, Yeltsin arranged a dressing down of Stepashin 
and 
refused to meet with him personally in the future (!), and 
demanded that Stepashin report to him every day at 0900 by 
telephone. 
  It was on Baturin's advice that Yeltsin congratulated women 
on 7 March in order to demonstrate to the whole country that he 
was healthy and able to function. 
  Later, new rumors were also started, in particular about the 
possibility of a coup d'etat on 17 March; a "version 1" appeared 
that was absolutely absurd in its internal contradictions, etc. 
  All serious observers realize that in the current situation 
neither the armed forces nor the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs) will resort to the use of force. Grachev, encountering 
the formation of at least four rival groups among the armed 
forces leadership, once again turned to the formula "the armed 
forces are outside politics." Even "hero of Russia" Yerin 
replied to a direct question from the president that he will 
carry out only a written order (but in his own circle he 
expressed doubt even about this). The "irreconcilable 
opposition" is significantly weaker today than before the 
October events, and therefore it will not be able to undertake 
anything serious. 
  But what did Baturin achieve? First, nervousness and 
uncertainty among the politically active part of society have 
increased. Second, it seems the ground is being prepared for 
unexpected personnel changes "at the top," whose initiator very 
likely will be the "diffident" Yu. Baturin. Third, as a result 
of "the March games," Baturin's ties with some "young" leaders 
have been strengthened. It is not accidental that G. Burbulis 
cooperated with him actively during these weeks (in recent weeks 
G.E. finally realized that he can be transformed from a 
secondary to a tertiary political figure). 
  ...Sixth, the action taken in March has hindered the 
objective process of forming coalition ties inside the ruling 
establishment itself, and it has made the leaders of different 
groups even more cautious. 
  ...So, Baturin has remained a "weakling," but today he is 
already a much more influential "weakling."

<F P=106> ["Speech by V.V. Zhirinovskiy at Seventh Interregional LDPR </F>
Conference"] 
  [Text] Politics is the same as economics. If there is a 
shortage of raw material, you do not, for example, manufacture 
more dictating machines, if you lack the raw material, the 
factory comes to a halt. You are short of engineers. You have 
the raw material, but there are no engineers. Or the workers 
have given up working. Exactly the same in a party. The same 
mechanism. There should be no abstract thinking here: The party 
has divine origins. This has stuck in our minds because of the 
CPSU: The CPSU was God-given, as it were.... There was no other 
such party anywhere. 
  This is the fate of Russia, it was always unique. Tsarism 
was 
for 300 years one family. There was change everywhere, but with 
us 300 years of the one Romanov family. They grew sickly because 
one family means no fresh blood. They marry cousins. It is bad 
when there is no change. This was where the CPSU became burned 
out. The one-party system has its advantages, but if there are 
other parties, which criticize, if there is an opposition. And 
when they are absent, the party is unnecessary also. 
  We are a country just like all others, but our mechanism of 
government does not afford us an opportunity to catch up with 
the advanced countries. And when we lag behind, we have, of 
course, an inferiority complex, and we start to get agitated, 
although at the same time we outpace others in some respects. 
Where we do outpace them is with the army, and we are casting 
this aside. The Russian Army was the strongest at the start of 
the century. We have just gone and broken it up. The Democratic 
Russia types are betraying their people--us--and attempting to 
do everything to please the Americans, failing to understand 
that this will do nothing for us, the Americans will give us 
nothing, they are continually making promises, but they 
themselves have no spare money. And no one will feed a 
competitor. No one will give anything, neither the Japanese nor 
the Germans. Our line, therefore, must be an independent foreign 
policy, and within the country we must approximate the version 
that prevailed in tsarist Russia, that is, introduce territorial 
division--provinces. All these federative treaties are useless. 
The breakup of the state would always be occurring with them 
because Tatarstan, Chuvashia, and Buryatia and the Khanty, 
Mansi, Komi, Permi, and so forth--they would all attempt to 
clothe themselves in a national covering, but the economy would 
not stand this. Bread cannot be Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani. 
Bread is for everyone. We cannot have the Abkhaz going hungry, 
the Georgians replete. 
  Nationalism, therefore, is a weapon that will only lead to 
war, nothing good would come of this. We should have a state and 
normal borders. With slight revision they should be preserved. 
Voluntarily, otherwise there will be war. War not with 
Russia--among themselves. They are now beginning to understand 
this. They are now filing back. They are now ready to return: 
Azerbaijan and Armenia and Tajikistan. Kazakhstan and Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan] are unhappy also. What kind of democracy is it when 
the president himself does not know whether, although he is 
president today, he could be assassinated tomorrow. Because 
terrorism, political included, and gangsterism and 
uncontrollable processes are very difficult. But they are a 
school: If you remove the director and the teachers, the 
students scamper about. A strict director, teachers, and a bell 
are needed, then this school functions. Take away these 
elements, all the classrooms are empty, the desks overturned, 
and the books discarded. Here's an ordinary example. So with the 
state also. We remove the president, we remove the army and the 
police, we remove the borders--there is no state. It is 
stupidity saying that the army can be removed, that the borders 
are unimportant. There would be gangsterism. Gangsters would run 
riot. They are already doing so today. They are already killing 
daily. Blood in Moscow every day. We are in a state of war. All 
hospitals will soon be like field hospitals. Diphtheria has 
already come to Moscow. 
  What is the problem with Yeltsin? The public sector should 
not have been destroyed. Everything would be fine. Dealing with 
the economy, but not destroying the public sector, the kolkhozes 
and sovkhozes, but strengthening them. After all, the country is 
chock-full of spare land. Hands off the kolkhoz land. Give those 
who wish to engage in agriculture--the farmers--the spare land. 
Hands off enterprises that are operating successfully. Hands off 
the AZLK [Lenin Komsomol Moscow Auto Works], authorize private 
automotive services, let the private operators service vehicles 
day and night, and the AZLK consistently improve its production. 
  But this was not done because our leaders did not know how, 
the scenario was different--destruction of the country. This was 
not a mistake of Aganbegyan, Gaydar, or Yavlinskiy's team. The 
predetermined scenario was demolition of our state. They busied 
themselves immediately, therefore, not with economic reform but 
the creation of people's fronts. It was they who attempted to 
ensure that the CPSU depart the political arena as gently as 
possible and that it be replaced by people's fronts. Elchibey 
came to power in Azerbaijan. And when he became superfluous, he 
was driven out, and the old one, Aliyev, returned once more. Or 
in Moldavia [Moldova] the same people's front. Lucinschi--the 
former secretary of the Communist Party of Moldavia Central 
Committee--has returned. And Brazauskas has returned in 
Lithuania. In two years--there they are again everywhere. 
  The army cannot be accused of treachery in a strong state 
because it defends this state, it cannot be a traitor. The 
Chilean option is impossible here: There is no candidate for the 
role of Pinochet. Makashov, Yazov could not have been such. 
Gromov--an Afghan veteran general--could not. Varennikov could 
have performed this role, but he is old, near 70. 
  Who arrested Beriya? Rokossovskiy, commander of air defense 
of the Moscow District. The army assumed this function. Makashov 
and Yazov displayed weakness, they could not do it. 
  Defense Minister Yazov honestly admitted: "I am not 
Pinochet." Had he not committed tanks to Moscow at that time, 
there would have been no Emergency Committee. 
  We have no Pinochet candidate. Zhukov could have been, but 
he 
is dead. Zhukov could have played the part of de Gaulle. The 
period coincides: De Gaulle came to power in France in 1953, 
Zhukov here was removed in 1956. All the other way about. 
Instead of putting General Zhukov, war hero, militant, strong, 
decisive, in the place of Khrushchev, an ignoramus, Khrushchev 
removed him. A general comes to power in a civilized country. 
And Eisenhower in America--a fighting general also. In these 
years America and France put fighting generals in power, at the 
head, as presidents, as civilians. We clear ours out. They, our 
generals, had experience and were decisive and intrepid people. 
They were removed, and such semi-imbeciles as your Khrushchev 
were installed, and around him was this whole team, Podgornyy. 
These people were incapable. The rayon is their level. And they 
were elevated to the height of a vast state. The most powerful 
state in the world. That's what the problem is. 
  We should have a special selection of personnel. This is the 
problem of the one-party system because, had there been 
opposition parties, Khrushchev, Podgornyy, Chernenko would never 
have been in power. But with a one-party system, the ten of them 
together make the decisions. There are ten of them, they decide 
who will head this party, who will be head of the state. The 
whole problem with the communists, the one-party system, was 
that, as they departed, they left an entirely undisciplined 
people: People can decide nothing, they do not want to. They did 
not have to think, everything was decided for them. And the 
party did not support the Emergency Committee. In Moscow alone 
there were 1 million members of the CPSU. In Russia, 10 million. 
Throughout the country, 20 million. And they did nothing. Where 
was the party? We cannot have just one person thinking in the 
Kremlin. The communist rank and file did not think. They did not 
have to: open up PRAVDA--the decisions of the Politburo are in 
there. And the entire country did not think. I am speaking about 
the system. I am not saying that they had some false slogans. 
The system itself was no good. We did not have to think, they 
decided everything for us every two or three months. Ten persons 
would meet in session, and PRAVDA would print it for us: Do this. 
  Some people say that things were good in the stagnation 
times. True, they were good for me also. But the golden days, 
when we would eat up what we did not have, are over. You cannot 
eat everything up, you have to set some things by. Eat a little, 
set a little by, and we use the interest alone--only the 
interest. But we simply ate through our entire income. We are 
now left without anything. Things were good under Brezhnev, but 
what are we to do now? 
  The Democratic Russia people also can objectively do nothing 
now because there is nothing. Our industry demanded renewal: 
Everything here is old. We had giant-mania: more doctors and 
teachers, but little use. We need quality, only quality. We need 
to fight for this. We fought for quantity. We lost out here. 
Quantity is good in a time of war: capture a large amount of 
territory. Quantity is needed then. But in civilian life only 
quality is needed. 
  Having experienced all this, we should not return to what 
was 
bad, to the old ways. We should take from tsarist Russia only 
the country's division into provinces. This was outstandingly 
well done. Catherine II did it over 200 years ago. An excellent 
option. Today we have 89 regions, but they are tiny, 
consequently, Russia needs 70 provinces with 2 million persons, 
approximately, in each. Some 150 persons altogether. It is this 
that should be taken from tsarist Russia. Tsarist Russia's was a 
mixed economy--that could be taken also. The State Duma--the 
first Russian parliament--the name, could be taken, it was 
bicameral, a Senate. This could be taken. 
  Problems of social security could be taken from the 
communists because, regardless of the events in the country, the 
old people are not to blame, each of us will be old. If a new 
revolution is begun when we are all 70, and we are once again 
left without pensions, without accommodations, without health 
care--this is preposterous. Social problems were tackled pretty 
well under the communists. Everyone had a physician for free, a 
pass to a recreation center sometimes and some kind of roof over 
his head, and a minimum diet. A person could live on a pension, 
he could live at least somehow on R50. We could take the 
solution of social problems from the communists, therefore. The 
decisions concerning pioneer camps, say, were pretty good. Is 
this a bad thing? Remove the word "pioneer," simply youth camps. 
But the children had a holiday, it was better than now, when 
they are washing cars. You may wash cars, but let whoever wants 
to go on holiday, go on holiday. Paid tuition is possible, but 
there must necessarily be tuition for free also. Some things may 
be taken from the communists, therefore. And we should take what 
world experience has accumulated, namely, a multiparty system. 
It is better taking the common, tried-and-tested path, we would 
do better to abandon experiments at this time.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Savin: "Elections Nemtsov-Style"] </F>
  [Text] Arkhangelskoye Village, Nizhegorod Oblast--Elections 
to the local authorities in Nizhegorod Oblast are scheduled for 
27 March. The support of no less than 3 percent of the 
district's electorate is required for registration as a 
candidate for deputy of the oblast legislative assembly. Such 
are the requirements of the statute on elections in the oblast. 
It was in accordance with this published law that I began to 
collect signatures. Our District No. 31 has an electorate of 
52,700, consequently, I needed the support of 1,581 persons. I 
managed this task, but all of a sudden there comes news (via the 
newspaper once again) just a few days before the end of the 
signature-collection and candidate-registration campaign that no 
fewer than 2,000 voters of the district have to support the 
candidate for deputy. In other words, the rules of the game have 
been changed during the game. Only with us, perhaps, is such a 
thing possible. 
  Also interesting is the fact that Governor Nemtsov has 
lowered the minimum turnout for the elections to be deemed valid 
to 25 percent of the electoral roll eligible "to vote and to run 
for office." 
  Let us now try to understand all that is going on at our 
elections. First, they will produce no changes in the organs of 
power. The administration heads will remain in place, possessing 
the real power. The village elders will be wholly dependent on 
the rayon mayors, having no command authority and receiving 
purely symbolic wages. 
  Second, the elections to the oblast organs of power have 
been 
planned such that at the first stage even, that is, at the time 
of registration of the candidates, a realistic chance of being 
elected was cut off for the ordinary mortal. Whoever adopted 
this law was either entirely ignorant of the territorial 
disconnectedness of the inhabitants in a rural locality or was 
in fact counting precisely on this. I can say from my own 
experience that it is no easy thing to collect the electorate's 
ID data in such a quantity in the countryside. It is 
considerably easier for whoever either has the money or occupies 
a directive position. In this case they operate not simply but 
very simply--they dispatch their subordinates to the meetings or 
they go to the personnel departments and the councils, where 
they write down all the data of interest to them. 
  Third, in a democratic (that is, power-of-the-people) state, 
it seems to me, the nomination of candidates for deputy by 
representatives of the ordinary working people should be made as 
easy as possible. But the governor of Nizhegorod Oblast has his 
own view of the organization of "democratic" elections. To 
consolidate his power he is prepared to sacrifice the interests 
of 75 percent of the electorate, which, evidently, is contrary 
to the rules of public law in a truly democratic country. I know 
once again from personal experience that even if the requisite 
number of people do not show up at the polls on 27 March, the 
missing votes will be added at the polling stations so that they 
may report and please the authorities. The question arises in 
this connection: Who needs these elections?

does this politician, whose party is amassing ever greater 
authority in society, represent? The recent elections were 
graphic confirmation that a "third force" confidently putting 
the squeeze on the communists and the democrats has appeared on 
Russia's political horizon. What kind of force is this? 
  Our correspondent met with V.V. Zhirinovskiy at LDPR 
Headquarters and asked him to answer a number of questions. 
  [Leontyev] Vladimir Volfovich, how do you evaluate the 
political situation that has taken shape in the country since 
the elections? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Things are bad for the people: As a 
consequence of revolutions, wars, perestroykas we are becoming 
destitute and dying before our time. For us as a political party 
this situation is very beneficial because the communists and 
Russia's Choice undermined their authority in 1991 and 1993. 
They have shown conclusively what they are worth. Voting by 
party slate, the electorate gave them 10-20 percent of the vote. 
The alignment of forces is in our favor, therefore. We are 
content and we believe that we are on the way to power, but we 
are not gloating. 
  [Leontyev] What, in your opinion, is the apportionment of 
forces in parliament? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It consists of three parts: the forces of the 
left--the members of the Agrarian Party, the communists and 
those associating with them, and the radical democrats--Russia's 
Choice--Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, and others, and ourselves. The 
LDPR is a party of a patriotic plane, in the main. The democrats 
will be the fewest. The communists could muster more, they have 
considerable influence in the country. And ourselves. This is as 
yet. But the future elections will make our victory irreversible. 
  [Leontyev] With which parties and blocs do you intend to 
cooperate? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] With none. We are a third force. Let others 
cooperate with us. We will support all sensible decisions, if 
they correspond to Russia's interests, from wherever they come. 
We do not have party interests or a desire to knock down some 
party. If the matter under discussion is right for everyone, it 
is immaterial who sponsored it. But we could never form a bloc 
with anyone because there are no kindred forces. We are not 
communists and not radical democrats. 
  [Leontyev] The makeup of the government. How do you see it? 
Will members of the LDPR be a part of it? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This will be decided by the president. He 
will 
form the government according to the new constitution. We are 
for its replacement.... Shumeyko has gone, Poltoranin has gone, 
Gaydar has gone. Consequently, there remain of that team 
Kozyrev, Chubays.... They must go, and then there will be a 
normal government. And the replacement should be people from the 
factions which obtained the majority. The LDPR could hold four 
positions, say. This would be a good version of a coalition 
government. 
  [Leontyev] Your first steps in the State Duma? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We have prepared a draft decree on a general 
political and economic amnesty in respect to all events and 
cases as of 15 April 1985 in order to close "perestroyka." None 
of the persons who were accused of political or economic crimes 
were guilty. Everything is now clear. We need to release 
everyone from prison and terminate the proceedings in the courts 
and investigating authorities. 
  [Leontyev] A few international questions: Russia has as of 
late abruptly changed its priorities and directions in its 
foreign policy in the Near East. Is this to Russia's advantage? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] In the sense of having turned its back on the 
Arabs? This is bad. This undermines our authority, military 
potential, and the economy. Here within everything is falling 
apart, and we are pulling apart foreign policy. 
  [Leontyev] You said that in the future you would cooperate 
with Iraq. Would this not cause a rupture with other countries? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No. We should have normal relations with the 
whole world. But there are priorities. Iraq owes us $10 billion. 
It would make sense for us to take this into consideration when 
we make a decision on the question of the blockade of Iraq. This 
would be to our advantage. Iraq is our strategic ally on the 
southern flank. 
  [Leontyev] You write in your book that the war in the Near 
East is not over and that it could ultimately become the cause 
of World War III. How do you evaluate the process of a peace 
settlement currently under way there? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Let them attempt to negotiate. God grant that 
everyone negotiate an end to conflicts. But this will not end 
because Israel, as a state, has not for 1,000 years been part of 
this region, where 100 million Arabs live and where there are 
many contemporary problems. There will be enmity, of course.... 
Unfortunately. Thank God, the war in Vietnam ended, and, 
perhaps, Korea will one day unite. Germany has united. But the 
Near East knot is the most complex. There is here the 
geopolitical factor, and the national and religious and economic 
factors play a part. It is the center of the Earth. For this 
reason this conflict will be more protracted, unfortunately. 
  [Leontyev] Could the Near East subsequently become the scene 
of a clash of Russian and American geopolitical interests, in 
your opinion? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This need not happen. We have enough of our 
own oil and gas. Let the Americans and Japanese purchase it in 
tranquillity there. There is no point us sticking our noses in 
there. Our interests will be confined to Turkey, Iran, 
Afghanistan, which lack the oil and gas the West would like to 
obtain. The borders of the Arab world are the borders of our 
economic interests. And Iran and Syria, if they gravitate toward 
us in a geopolitical sense, this would be to our advantage. 
  [Leontyev] You write in your book that it would be to the 
benefit of the majority of mankind were the Muslim world to be 
anatomized, that we need to exclude the Muslim danger. Would 
this not lead to clashes in interethnic soil? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] They are occurring now. They need to be 
averted. Unless there are cohesive Christian and Muslim worlds 
(there is a Christian world also in Latin America and Australia, 
the Muslim world is concentrated in North Africa, Asia Minor, 
and Central Asia), there will be no peace. This concentration 
needs to be cut through, then there will be no possibilities of 
the concentrated offensives of extremist forces, of 
pan-Islamism. As formerly the Crusades subjugated people by the 
sword and blood, converting them to the Christian faith. 
  [Leontyev] Let us return, however, to our problems: Is a 
repetition of the opposition of the legislature and the 
executive possible, in your opinion? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, on the part of Russia's Choice. No one 
would any longer be in opposition. Russia's Choice would very 
much like this Duma to be broken up also. This is a group of 
adventurers that has no future, and for this reason they would 
like in the final phase of the conflict to dash out of the 
country or to ensure their security by way of the establishment 
of dictatorship. They have two options: either leaving the 
country or dictatorship, normal work would threaten them with 
having to leave the government, then a new procuracy and a new 
government would institute criminal proceedings against them. 
Fear in the face of their liability would push them toward 
confrontation. But they are the minority, and we hope, 
therefore, that this will not happen. 
  [Leontyev] And the final question, perhaps it is the first 
also: What, in your opinion, was the reason for the failure of 
Russia's Choice? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is not a party. A purely technical 
failure. 
A party wins. But if on the eve of elections you form some team 
and give it a stupid name--Russia's Choice.... What does this 
mean? What is its political orientation? It is not known.... 
And, second: Those who are to blame for all our troubles were 
assembled there.... They should have gone into hiding, left, put 
up neutral persons, but they are all there in a bunch: Burbulis, 
Gaydar, Yakunin.... They all assembled in this crowd, which has 
bungled so much.... They do not understand tactics: They should 
have left for other structures, moved into the background, and 
made Russia's Choice neutral--some new organization--they might, 
perhaps, have fooled some people, but they could not get their 
bearings even here, and they all barged their way through.... 
And they are still abusing one another in the Kremlin over 
ministerial portfolios and physically coming to blows. They are 
not simply insulting and criticizing, a showdown is under way, 
as among street toughs. That is your grouping. This why they 
lost.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Khinshteyn: "Presents for Barkashov: </F>
He Was Met Not With Empty Hands"] 
  [Text] At a time when the recent prisoner and accused 
Aleksandr Barkashov is carefully hiding from the public in an 
undisclosed hospital, his associates in Russian National Unity 
[RNYe] are not wasting any time. 
  As became known to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS [MK] from sources 
within RNYe, most of its members were recently made aware of 
instructional guidelines from the DSP. On behalf of the Central 
Staff, it was explained to the "Nazis" precisely how they should 
wage propaganda among the population (it is not accidental that 
recent issues of the RUSSKIY PORYADOK party organ appeared in 
exactly a size that could be duplicated by Xerox in A4 format) 
and how to attract citizens into the party ranks. In particular, 
it is stated that it is desirable to make it mandatory for 
newcomers to participate in certain combat actions, in order to 
link them forever with RNYe. The ideologists call upon people to 
resort to any means, so long as they hold onto people who are 
already running off in all directions (recently Unity was 
abandoned by a very large number of its supporters, and some of 
the businessmen who had given money had stopped acting the role 
of Maecenas. Rumors are rampant throughout RNYe concerning a 
certain businessman who, prior to October, had sponsored the 
"idea," but who, after refusing to continue to provide 
financing, had been robbed by "unknown" criminals. 
  The fact that all these indications are coming not from 
Barkashov himself forces one to wonder seriously about exactly 
who in the RNYe is the main person. It is known that chief of 
staff Viktor Krivov, even during the preputsch period, played 
far from the last violin in the party. Especially since people 
are beginning to hear vague news about a forthcoming 
reorganization of Unity. It is not precluded that whereas the 
recently one-man leader had been, by definition, the Chief 
Associate -- Barkashov, and the Central Staff had subordinated 
itself to him, a staff which in turn managed the regional 
organizations, now Aleksandr Petrovich will have to coordinate 
all his decisions with the staff. In a word, the "Nazis" are 
being beset by the very same problems that beset the recent 
Supreme Soviet and the president. 
  Since Barkashov's arrest, the party has already had time to 
hold a few underground meetings (as a rule, in secret warehouse 
apartments where the RUSSKIY PORYADOK and AL-KODS newspapers are 
stored. MK knows, for example, about the existence of a secret 
meeting place like this in the area of the Shchukinskaya subway 
station), at which meetings it was decided to continue the fight 
and to create a commission to investigate the assassination 
attempt on their leader. The basic versions that were put forth 
were: a) it was the work of the Israeli Beytar militarized 
organization; b) it was purely a Mafia action involving money 
(the fact that Barkashov's people engage in the protection of 
commercial institutions is no secret to anyone); and c) it was 
the work of domestic intelligence services. The "investigators" 
doubt very much that this was done by competitors from other 
fascist parties. Probably they do not want to discredit the 
idea. The commission has begun its work and hopes to finish it 
before the already healthy Barkashov convokes the next party 
rally. 
  P.S. When this article was being prepared for the press, MK 
learned that Aleksandr Petrovich Barkashov had returned home to 
his apartment on Ulitsa Vavilova. In a conversation with an MK 
correspondent he stated that he would continue to carry out the 
fight while remaining the permanent leader of RNYe and, if any 
new disturbances occur, his party will participate in them once 
again, defending the interests of the Russian people. In 
Barkashov's opinion, today the chances of their victory are much 
better than they were before October.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ostrosvetov: "The Russian Order of </F>
Alexander Barkashov"; the first paragraph is introductory 
paragraph; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] The Russian National Unity (RNU) movement will hold 
its constituent congress in April, at which the founding of a 
new political party will most likely be announced. The movement 
makes no secret of its intention to come to power in Russia, to 
restore the "single and indivisible Russia in the borders of the 
Russian empire," and then consider expanding it. One of the RNU 
declarations is devoted to the "work for training disciplined 
groups who support a strong, indivisible and powerful Russia for 
active political and, subsequently, state activity." 
<H5>  Leader </H5>
  Alexander Barkashov, the leader of the RNU, was born in 
1953. 
According to information, his grandfather participated in the 
repressions of 1940-50, and held responsible posts in the 
apparat of the VKP(b)-CPSU Central Committee. Barkashov has no 
higher education; his main profession is electrician. He is also 
coach-instructor in karate (he owns a brown girdle). He served 
in the special units of the army. In 1987-90 Barkashov was a 
member of the Central Council of the Pamyat society headed by 
Dmitry Vasilyev. At that time they had a falling out. 
Withdrawing from Pamyat, Barkashov set up his own organization 
in the autumn of 1990 -- "Russian National Unity for a strong, 
free and just Russia." Since 1991 it has been called Russian 
National Unity. 
<H5>  Organization </H5>
  There is some structure underlying the RNU (although it is 
changing). It is as follows: Leader-Main 
Companions-Companions-associates-sympathizers. The leader is 
Barkashov. The companions consist of militants, members of a 
militarized organization within the RNU. Now they number about 
600, much more than during the October events. According to 
press reports, 137 Barkashov militants fought near the White 
House. It is known for certain that two of them died -- Dmitry 
Marchenko and Anatoly Sursky, both officers in the reserve. It 
is common knowledge that RNU militants protected the coup 
leaders -- Barannikov, Dunayev, Achalov, Makashov. Most of the 
RNU members, led by Barkashov, left the White House in advance. 
  In order to become RNU Companions, one needs absolutely 
unstained "racially pure Slav" ancestry (spanning at least four 
generations). Any mixture of Jewish, Gypsy, Caucasian or Central 
Asian blood is categorically ruled out. In order to join the 
ranks of the Companions, a candidate must take an oath. This 
happens after the trial period of one year, but "it may be 
reduced in special cases." After becoming a RNU militant, a 
person loses his individual identity. Although he is not 
permanently living in the barracks, he is still obliged to 
present himself when his superiors call. No considerations of 
personal or family character are taken into account. The 
militants train in shooting and in hand-to-hand combat at the 
bases where they spend from several days to a month. The 
location of the bases is kept secret, but according to some, 
they are in the Moscow Region -- one not far from Balashikha, 
the other -- near the Perlovka railway station. 
  The militants are divided into sub-units under the command 
of 
the Main Companions. A sub-unit consists of 20 people or more. 
The main Companions are included in the so-called RNU Commanders 
Council. 
  Apart from Companions, the organization also has Associates. 
They do not swear an oath and do not fight in combat formations. 
There are several thousand more Associates than Companions. In 
order to become an Associate a trial period is also necessary: 
for a certain period of time a person will serve as a 
Sympathizer, carrying out the assignments of the organization 
and recruiting new supporters. Among the RNU Sympathizers there 
are "high-ranking" generals, officials from the highest 
structures of the Interior Ministry and so on. 
<H5>  `The oath of Companion-in-arms' and `Code of Honor' </H5>
  The oath which the Companions take has 10 points, among them 
the commitment "to be ruthless to the external and internal 
enemies of Russia and the Russian nation," "to be always ready, 
by order of the Chief Companion, to defend the interests of 
Russia and the Russian nation and fight to the last breath 
against the external and internal enemies of Russia and the 
Russian nation within Russia and beyond its borders." Moreover, 
for breaking the oath "Companions must treat its violators as 
the Code of Honor of the Companion" prescribes: with capital 
punishment. The Code of Honor declares that the Companion is 
regarded as "the plenipotentiary of the Russian nation," and 
therefore it is his duty to restore justice for the Russian 
people" "with the power entrusted to him and with his arms, not 
appealing to judicial or other means." For members of the 
organization, no laws exist except their own: "The Companion 
resolves any questions, guided only by national consciousness, 
in keeping with the powers entrusted to him by the Chief 
Companion, and obeys no other laws." A very important point: "A 
Companion must always remember that Russia has no friends," and 
further: "the Companion may cleanse himself of the disgrace only 
with blood." 
<H5>  Members of the RNU </H5>
  There are quite a number of military people in the RNU: 
regular officers, servicemen in the reserve, those in active 
service. There are militiamen and those serving in the interior 
forces. There are also quite a few workers, students and several 
clergymen. 
<H5>  Program </H5>
  The Russian nation must become dominant in Russia. As for 
other peoples, a "differentiated" approach to them is advocated. 
They are divided into "natives" and "non-natives." The plans 
regarding "non-native" peoples are not published, they are 
worked out in secret documents of the organization. It is known 
that Caucasians, Turks, Central Asians will have the right to 
live only on their "historic territories," "a sharp reduction of 
birth rate" is expected in their countries," "a reduction of 
their number to minimum." As for Jews and Gypsies, "they will be 
fully eradicated as soon as possible." Barkashovites maintain 
that "Jews should not be deported either to the West or to 
Israel, because this will only strengthen the positions of world 
Zionism and its subversive work against Russia." It is suggested 
that the laws of Hitler's Germany be introduced in Russia. In 
other words, mixed marriage or liaisons "causing harm to the 
genetic fund of the Russian nation and leading to its dilution 
will be persecuted by law." 
  Russia, being a unitary state, must "as far as its 
administrative structure is concerned, follow the historical 
tradition, be divided into provinces and these provinces, in 
their turn, into districts and then into volosts" (small rural 
districts). The "existence of no autonomous territorial 
formations, splitting up the Russian people and weakening 
Russia" should be allowed on the territory of Russia. 
  Power must be concentrated in the hands of the "Russian 
national leader." Democracy is declared "a naive idea which has 
never been carried out anywhere (since power may realistically 
be put only in the hands of elite). It was invented by Zionists 
and Masons for demoralization of the nation and the seizure of 
world supremacy." 
<H5>  Propaganda </H5>
  The main publication of the RNU, the paper Russky 
Poryadok, has been published for about 18 months. After the 
October events the circulation of the newspaper rose -- the last 
issue claimed a distribution of 150,000 copies. At 100 rubles 
per copy it is not expensive. Its Editor-in-Chief is Kochetkov, 
Deputy Editor-in-Chief is Kremlev; members of the Editorial 
Board: Kokorev and Skirdenko; Marchenko, too, who was killed 
during the October events, was a member of the Editorial Board. 
The Editorial Board of Russky Poryadok are members of 
the Council of the RNU Commanders. 
  The movement made an attempt to publish one more newspaper 
-- 
Russian Banner but the plan failed, only one issue 
was published. In Krasnoyarsk, the RNU publishes the paper 
Russian Nation (circulation about 15,000 copies), its 
Editor-in-Chief is Yemelyanenko. The paper is registered, just 
as the Russian Order (the registration number is 
1184). Recently magazine The Attack was established. 
Apart from these regular publications, the RNU mimieographs and 
distributes leaflets and appeals. In the newspapers and leaflets 
of the RNU, reports often appear which do not correspond to 
reality. Instead of facts, there is only a confident tone. Thus, 
the paper Russky Poryadok (December 1993-January 
1994) maintained that the White House was fired at by the 
snipers of the 6th NATO Brigade and so on. 
  The RNU carries on its propaganda purposefully. After 
selecting a military unit, an enterprises or an educational 
establishment, it begins a "permanent contact," distributes 
literature there and sends agitators. 
<H5>  Relations with other parties and movements </H5>
  The members of the RNU participate in the meetings and 
demonstrations of related parties and movements. However, the 
relations between them and the RNU are strained and often 
hostile. Barkashovites are particularly hostile to Zhirinovsky 
and the LDPR. They regard Vladimir Volfovich as "the agent of 
Zionism, who has made his way into the ranks of the 
national-patriotic movement with the aim of destroying it." 
<H5>  Relations with the Church </H5>
  In theory the RNU is a supporter of Orthodoxy, but "it 
respects and restores Orthodoxy as well as pre-Orthodox Russian 
national traditions," using various "symbols of national 
self-consciousness" (octagonal star, crosses, swastika and 
rotating cross), and the use of "masonic, anti-Russian symbols." 
The RNU does not lay stress on questions of religion and the 
church. The main thing for a person is to be a fanatic 
nationalist, an advocate of "racial purity," since he will be 
ready for Orthodoxy any way. The Barkashovites regard the 
present leaders of the Russian Orthodox church "mostly as 
Zionist-masonic" and insist on their being removed from the 
posts they hold. "The time has come to decide whom you side 
with. And if you do not decide, we shall decide for you and give 
everyone his due." This is the appeal of the newspaper 
Russky Poryadok to the leadership of the Russian 
Orthodox Church. 
<H5>  Sources of financing </H5>
  The members of the organization pay no dues. Despite this, 
the movement does not have financial problems. According to 
information at the disposal of MN, the movement and 
some of its members have shares in commercial structures. Many 
of the RNU members are employed as guards at trade and 
commercial institutions. Barkashovites "maintain order" when 
functions of national-patriotic orientation are held and, of 
course, their services are not free of charge.

<F P=106> Article [Article by Sergey Gulyy, under rubric "Analysis and </F>
Forecast": "Not Quite Statesmen: In Exchange for the Full Price 
the Voters Got Only an Empty Derzhavnaya Bottle"] 
  [Text] A Pioneer is a good example for all children. And a 
deputy is the same kind of mirror of society. Under communism, 
the party used to select the deputies: so many bachelors, so 
many representatives of national minorities, so many women, 
retirees, milking-machine operators... You were supposed to be 
able, on the basis of "the poeople's choices," to judge the 
quality of the initial raw materials. The mirror could also make 
slight improvements. But now anybody can become a deputy. 
  It is curious to compare what the "people" and its best 
exemplars think about one and the same question. If their views 
coincide, that means that something is wrong with the "people." 
So let's take advantage of Citizen Pashkov's Mneniye [Opinion] 
service. A survey involving "international" questions was 
conducted among 211 members of the Duma, who represent all the 
parliamentary factions, and also among ordinary Muscovites and 
other Russians. The results were rounded off to entire 
percentages. 
  Test for "presence of lice." Should Alaska belong to Russia 
or the United States. Exactly half of both groups responded: to 
the United States. 
  What about Crimea? It should belong to us, according to 51 
percent of the deputies and 61 percent of the other inhabitants. 
An additional 40 percent of the parliamentarians agree to a 
compromise. Among the civilian population the number of people 
unwilling to make a compromise is twice as large -- only 18 
percent are in favor of a compromise. 
  "Is Russia threatened by an aggression against it by the 
year 
2000?" "Completely possible" -- 26 percent of the Duma deputies, 
but only one percent of the Muscovites. "Unavoidable" -- one 
percent of the Duma deputies and 22 percent of the Muscovites. 
It turns out that, among one-fourth of the city dwellers, 
including the parliamentarians who are temporarily registered in 
the capital, there is something wrong with the "roof." 
  There is somewhat of a lack of coincidence with regard to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, the longtime 
favorite of Yeltsin's opponents. His resignation is supported by 
17 percent of the Muscovites and by 3 times as many deputies. 
The spread among the various factions is astonishing: 100 
percent of the Zyuganovite Communists vote in favor of 
elimination; and 100 percent of the liberals from 12 Dekabrya 
[12 December] support Kozyrev. The respondents who are closest 
to the Muscovites' opinion are Shakhrayites from PRES. 
  When we evaluate the deputies' attitude to the possible 
secession of the South Kurile Islands and East Prussia from 
Russia, it turns out that, as compared with the evicted 
Khasbulatovites, the Rybkinites, even if they have begun to be a 
bit more tight-fisted, have done so only barely. Thus, four 
years ago 20 percent in one form or another agreed with the need 
to expand Japan at the expense of the "northern territories," 
but now only 17 percent do. Only a slightly larger number of 
Duma deputies are tied to Kaliningrad: 6 percent in 1990 were in 
favor of returning it, but only 2 percent today. 
  In conclusion, the deputies' opinion concerning Yeltsin's 
foreign policy and certain sharp questions about the state 
system. It turns out that they are much less decisive about 
these matters than one would assume. Only 58 percent are in 
favor of cutting off economic aid to other countries; and only 
56 percent are in favor of reinforcing the customs system in the 
CIS, by closing only the transparent borders. An entire fourth 
-- 24 percent --are in favor of letting Chechnya go with our 
blessing, and an additional 21 percent are in favor of letting 
the Dniester region go also (that is, are in favor of the 
withdrawal of the 14th Army). 
  In general, if one believes Mneniye, the members of the 
State 
Duma, 1993 convocation, proved to be much lesser statesmen that 
one could have assumed by listening to their campaign promises. 
They voted, in order to annoy Yeltsin, in favor of outright 
loudmouths who did not necessarily share their views. And with a 
consideration of the deputy metamorphosis, practically speaking, 
they got themselves. The voting "against," plus the 
counterdeception of the people's choices provided the 
preservation of the status quo and the more than adequate 
representation in the Duma of the moods of the "masses," at 
least with regard to international matters. So, children, do not 
become deputies. They are dishonest, they do not love their 
Homeland sufficiently, and, in addition, they secretly support 
Uncle Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Sharonov: "Poor People's Party Is Being </F>
Created"] 
  [Text] It was difficult to look at those who arrived 
at the Forum motion-picture theater in the capital without an 
aching sense of pity and empathy: elderly women in decrepit 
clothing, old men with dried-out faces, disabled people on 
crutches, blind people with guide dogs... 
  It would seem that the rosy-cheeked "reformers" have done 
everything to crush these people, to take away from them their 
last strength and their will to live. But those people, thrice 
deceived, lied to, and robbed, nevertheless have preserved their 
hope of getting a better share. They stood in line waiting to 
sign the petitions, in order to support the idea of creating a 
new party -- the Russian Poor People's Party (PBR). That idea 
had been proposed by Nikolay Ayvazyan, leader of the Charity 
movement. 
  What tasks does the PBR intend to resolve? First of all, the 
task of uniting the efforts of all Russians, two-thirds of whom 
have proven to be at the poverty line, in their search for the 
quickest way out of the economic and political crisis. Secondly, 
the task of defending the interests of the indigent and socially 
unprotected segments of the population -- the workers, peasants, 
and intellectuals -- who have become the victims of the woeful 
experimenters. Thirdly, the task of consolidating the poor 
people to carry out planned and persistent actions to defend 
their legal rights and freedoms, and to strive for the 
development and implementation of a state program to protect the 
indigent. And, obviously, to render specific psychological and 
material assistance to those who need it. 
  The first PBR congress will be held in May. But already it 
has been announced that the payment of dues is not mandatory. If 
this is the case, how will the party exist? In response to this 
question, N. Ayvazyan answered, "There are a rather 
large number of businessmen who are ready to take on the expense 
of maintaining homes for disabled people, boarding homes for the 
elderly, hospitals, and orphanages, to supply food products, and 
give grants in aid for the downtrodden. But the exorbitant taxes 
that are going basically into the maintenance of the apparatus 
of officials who are no less rapacious than racketeers are 
killing people's business initiative and stifling production. 
The PBR will take actions to reduce and even abolish the taxes 
for those entrepreneurs who take close to their hearts the 
misfortunes of their compatriots and who engage dynamically in 
philanthropy. People like this are already expressing today the 
desire to provide material support to the Poor People's Party 
and even to enter its ranks. And I understand them well: with 
the situations that exist, they have the threat of ruination 
hanging over their heads constantly. Where should they be, if 
not in the PBR?" 
  The Poor People's Party is not planning to seize the power 
or 
carry out a revolution. But if it truly becomes a mass 
organization, figures both in the legislative and the executive 
structures will be forced to listen attentively to it. 
  The creation of low-level PBR cells has begun.

Trade Unions Federation: "The Students and the Power: The 
Process Has Started...: On the Eve of a Student Rally the St. 
Petersburg Government Made Important Decisions"] 
  [Text] It would seem that the city government is 
beginning to understand that the situation that has formed with 
the social protection of the St. Petersburg student group is an 
explosive one. (This newspaper has written about the student 
rally that is planned for 12 April.) Today people are already 
demanding the urgent interference of the executive authority in 
order to prevent a French recurrence on the banks of the 
Neva. 
  On 7 April the first session of the Commission on Problems 
of 
the Student Youth was held in the Department of Youth Policy, of 
the St. Petersburg government. That commission was created on 
the order of city mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. Sergey Prushchak was 
appointed chairman of the commission, and Vyacheslav Ryabkov, a 
consultant on youth affairs in the St. Petersburg and oblast 
Trade Unions Federation, became his deputy. The commission 
includes representatives of academy science, the council of 
rectors, and tekhnikum directors, as well as the students 
themselves and representatives of student trade unions. Now 
there has appeared in the structure of the city's executive 
authority an agency that has received the right to prepare 
drafts of decrees for the St. Petersburg government with regard 
to student youth problems. 
  According to tentative information, Vitaliy Mutko, deputy 
chairman of the St. Petersburg government, is supposed to 
allocate from the fund for the social protection of the city's 
population more than 900 million rubles for 1994 in order to 
render assistance to the most needy categories of students. At 
the next commission session, on 27 April of this year, there 
will be a discussion of the procedure for paying grants in aid 
to the most unprotected categories of students.

<F P=106> [Interview with His Eminence Ioann, Metropolitan of St. </F>
Petersburg and Ladoga, by Aleksandr Prokhanov, editor in chief 
of the newspaper ZAVTRA; place and date not given: "Metropolitan 
Ioann: `Russia Is the Footstool at the Throne of God'"] 
  [Text] [Prokhanov] Your Eminence, like every other person 
who is disturbed by the crime of last October, my attitude 
toward what happened is constantly changing. I was involved in 
it indirectly, my friends suffered. At first I felt the 
disaster, the tragedy, in my heart. And during the first two 
days after the gunfire, the firing from the tanks, and the 
burial of the victims I experienced terror, human terror. And 
then this terror was replaced by sadness, apathy, depression. It 
seemed that something great had been lost, that this bloodshed 
would not pass without leaving its mark on our history of long 
suffering. But as time passed and I increasingly came to accept 
what had been done, my depression began to be replaced by a 
strange sense of light. There appeared to be hope that these 
sacrifices, these deaths were not simply bloody absurdity. There 
is some providential, Russian Orthodox point in all this. 
  The martyrs, some of them to their faith, some of them to 
the 
homeland, some to the people, did not die in vain. Their death 
expiates the vileness, the filth, the swinishness, the thievery, 
the disintegration. The October events were a light-producing 
explosion...for example, my comrade Stanislav Terekhov, the 
first to be taken, was beaten up terribly and thrown into an 
artillery enclosure. He said that there he decided to become a 
Christian. And this is a representative of the Red military 
organization, the Union of Officers. Moreover, there, in jail, 
he decided he wanted to get married in the church. 
  It seems to me that this is related to a spiritual 
transformation and I would like to hear your opinion: Am I 
right? How is one to feel about all this? What is the spiritual 
meaning of the recent events? 
  [Ioann] I think Terekhov's example is very telling. The 
Union 
of Officers, as far as I know, has cooperated with a number of 
Orthodox brotherhoods in Moscow and St. Petersburg. And it was 
suggested that Terekhov become a Christian long ago, since he 
has always been very respectful toward Orthodoxy. But, 
apparently, something kept him from it, something was standing 
in his way. And, being an honest person, he probably did not 
want to take these steps just to please others. Some internal 
shift was necessary. Thank God if it occurred after the events 
of "Black October." 
  Even the ancient Greek philosophy included the concept of 
"catharsis"--purging through tragedy. And the teachings of the 
Orthodox Church tell us that any moral improvement is possible 
only through grief. A person pays for his spiritual growth 
through hardship encountered on his path, patience, and the 
ability to endure pain which is found only in the experienced 
and wise. Disaster deprives a person of a sense of external 
well-being and forces him to change his spiritual condition. And 
the first step on the path of Christian improvement is 
recognition of one's lack of well-being. Shock, spiritual 
disturbance. 
  When this happens, a person begins to feel that something is 
wrong in his life, that something is missing. And if at this 
time he fearlessly asks himself the most unpleasant, "accursed" 
questions--he will inevitably come to the Church, he will come 
to a religious experience of the world, to the understanding 
that a full-value existence is impossible without God. "I rebuke 
and punish all whom I love," said the Lord. The main thing is 
for the punishment not to be in vain, so that after spiritual 
vision will follow repentance from sins and a change in life. 
  Now about what happened in October. In the first place, 
nothing supernatural or surprising occurred. All of Russian 
history is catastrophic. Cataclysm after cataclysm, catastrophe 
after catastrophe. The Russian people, carrying through the 
centuries the Orthodox idea of the embodiment of the truths of 
the faith, the ideals of justice and mercy, into surrounding 
life, are endlessly "squeezing" through those circumstances that 
stand in their way. In an imperfect world evil fights very 
effectively against good. And when various theological 
principles are being realized in life they inevitably encounter 
the most stubborn resistance. 
  From this viewpoint there is nothing surprising about the 
October events. They are just another obstacle on the path to 
Russian revival. But at the same time they are an extremely 
serious warning. If we do not draw the necessary conclusions, if 
we are not able to break the negative tendencies in the life of 
Russian society, if we are not able to make ourselves return to 
the historic path of development and restore the connection of 
time that has been broken since the 1917 revolution, then the 
blood in October will have been shed in vain. 
  It seems to me that the outcome of these events is not a 
defeat of the people but a kind of victory, because it was very 
difficult to assume that after the incredible ordeals the 
Russian people have been through during this century, after the 
desecration of the past eight years of "perestroyka," there 
would so many people in Moscow who would come to the White 
House. Because there were very many of them. 
  And this is in spite of the fact that on the opposing side 
were strength and power and a many-century tradition of 
obedience, which is so inherent in the Russian personality. In 
spite of the fact that the opposing side had the media, the 
leaders of the opposition were not so attractive to the mass 
consciousness. The people went "for the idea." This, 
incidentally, escapes the attention of many analysts. 
  On the opposing side everything is clear. They went there 
for 
the benefits, "for the power." There everything is 
psychologically comfortable. But here there is nothing but 
discomfort. There was not even a common leader, not even a 
common banner. But the people came. This means that the charge 
of spiritual energy in society is indeed considerably greater 
than it seems. 
  [Prokhanov] After this disaster, when the crisis in Russia 
had become even deeper and more terrible, when society was even 
more divided, the powers that be came up with a number of plans 
to consolidate the level of victory that had been reached and to 
stop the slide into ultimate chaos, civil strife and 
disobedience, and a general Russian catastrophe. Among all these 
political and cultural-ideological plans, I am taken by one that 
is still not being openly discussed, but they are beginning to 
whisper about it in the back rooms and political clubs. They are 
beginning to speak about restoring the monarchy. The monarchist 
plan is being considered from various angles, and its various 
contours are coming to the surface. For example, one suggests 
transforming the current president into a patron, into a regent 
of the young Cesarevich, who will be crowned for Tsardom and 
become the Russian ruler. Another plan suggests direct election 
of a Tsar involving a convocation of the synod--all-Russian, 
including all classes...and this is surprising! 
  When I was a young man it seemed impossible even to think 
about the revival of Orthodoxy. But my friend who was later 
ordained into the holy orders said even then: "Everything is in 
God's hands. A miracle is possible. On these ruins on which we 
are now standing (we were standing on the ruins of the New 
Jerusalem Monastery), believe me, even in our lifetime the 
cloister will be restored. And perhaps we will become brothers 
in this cloister...." 
  I did not believe him and spoke ironically. But indeed--the 
miracles happened! And not only in Church life. The restoration 
of the monarchy was not being discussed in Russia at all 20 
years ago. It was a daydream, the wish of a tiny group of 
extreme monarchists who could be found in certain Orthodox 
circles. There were none at all in secular life. And now the 
daydream has almost become a real political aspiration which 
could even be achieved this summer. 
  But here is what I would like to hear from you. I understand 
that the Orthodox Church consciousness perceives Russian state 
institutions in the monarchist form which is traditional for 
Russia: an Orthodox monarchy. Not a truncated, constitutional 
one, but an autocratic one that is linked to a mystical 
anointing of the Tsar, one that is consecrated by the Church and 
Christ. But could it not happen that today's planners imbue the 
monarchy with an essentially atheistic context. The more so 
since the classes that at one time developed, brought forth, and 
provided for the actualization of the monarchy no longer exist. 
We do not have the aristocracy through which the monarchy made 
its mark in society, was nourished by its juices, nor do we have 
the nobility by which it was supported through military 
institutions. 
  How can the monarchy be restored in our postindustrial 
society? Will this great cause not turn into a profanation, a 
sham, a discreditation of the very idea? Is this not a 
mechanical, premature action and is there no craftiness included 
in this plan? Will we not be brought some foreign Tsar in a 
snuff box? I am convinced that the Church is far from 
indifferent to these issues.... 
  [Ioann] In the first place, one must say that over many 
centuries the basic creative principles of Russian life have 
been defined by the remarkable phrase "orthodoxy, autocracy, and 
nationality." Officially, it was suggested by Count Uvarov at 
the beginning of the 19th century but in reality it has defined 
all Russian life since the age of the reign of Ivan III, the 
moment when the centralized Russian Orthodox state was formed. 
  We must keep in mind that this phrase is not the product of 
any arbitrary human contrivance but a statement of an objective 
fact--the fact that a harmoniously constructed society must 
contain in its basis three most important elements: spiritual, 
state, and national. The spiritual element is Holy Orthodoxy. 
The state-organizing element is autocracy, and an autocracy may 
be regarded at three different levels, and all three of them are 
quite justified. 
  First. It is possible to regard it as a particular political 
mechanism whereby the supreme power in the state, which is in no 
way limited, belongs to the monarch. This is a mechanical way of 
looking at it, but a correct one. 
  Second. One can regard autocracy as a state structure 
whereby 
the fullness of power, which determines the state of affairs in 
the country, belongs to its internal state institutions. 
  From this viewpoint Russia today is not an autocratic 
country 
because it is half controlled from abroad. Nor was Russia an 
autocratic country when it was under Tatar-Mongol power, since 
the Khan's Baskaks were stationed in Saray and there the Russian 
prince received the edict to reign from the great Khan. Today it 
is quite possible to draw a kind of analogy between these two 
epochs. 
  Then there is a third level of the understanding of an 
autocracy. It is mainly inherent in the Russian soul and it is 
the Church, the spiritual level. In this case autocracy is 
regarded as a moral-religious condition of society, the 
collective national spirit. When people recognize that they want 
to live not under the power of Ivan, Petr, or Sidor, not under 
the power of any "legal" systems created by the weak and corrupt 
human understanding, but they want to build their life according 
to God's law, that higher law of justice, love, and mercy which 
is given to man in Revelations. 
  And then the people, voluntarily accepting the "yoke and 
burden" of Christ and the Gospels, will crown the entire state 
structure with the figure of the anointed sovereign of God--the 
Russian Orthodox Tsar. All three levels of understanding and 
laws are admissible. But we, of course, are necessarily 
attracted most by the spiritual-mystical level. 
  The last element of Uvarov's triad is nationality. He 
suggests the existence of a concrete collective bearer of 
religious-moral ideals. And so the Orthodox spiritual 
foundation, the state form of power, and the people as the 
collective bearer of the moral ideal--such is the universal 
formula for a harmonious social structure. And we will never get 
away from it. We can try to falsify it, emasculate it, to pin 
the "Black 100" label on it and declare it obsolete, out of 
date, and unfeasible--but in vain. Any society, beginning with 
Ancient Egypt headed by the Pharaohs and ending with the modern 
cosmopolitan American society with its "ethnic melting pot," 
lives according to these three fundamental laws. 
  The entire question, of course, is which spiritual and 
religious principles lie at their basis. Today in the West, 
unfortunately, these are blatantly theomachistic, anti-Christian 
principles. As for modern Russia, first of all one must say that 
the monarchy cannot be established from above, just as a person 
cannot be ordered to "be a believer." The people must grow into 
this condition. And there are a number of signs from which it is 
possible to judge that the processes of such spiritual growth 
are going on. For what we are observing in Rus today is a 
miracle. 
  By all human measures, according to all rational 
calculations, this should have been a spiritual desert long ago, 
everything should have been burned and destroyed. We have been 
suffocated, poisoned, and mortified for almost an entire 
century! I think that the backroom architects who planned these 
terrible scenarios for Russia thought that the Russian people 
would never regain their viability, in any case not within the 
fairly long amount of time it would take to set in motion new 
mechanisms of destruction which would on a new level incinerate 
and remold the reviving spiritual energy of the Russian people. 
  But "man supposes while God disposes." It has been no time 
at 
all since 1985--eight years, and since the time of the first 
shock (August '91)--three years. But the changes are taking 
place rapidly, especially, of course, in the world views of 
those elite groups of the population that determine the 
condition of society to a considerable degree. And this speed 
makes it possible for the plans you are discussing to exist. 
  I have already had occasion to hear about them from various 
parties. As of today there is no real possibility of revival 
within the framework of the existing political structure of 
those spiritual ideals which would make it possible to give 
Russian statehood a monarchic form. You cannot put a suit on a 
dog and pass it off as a gentleman. And cosmetic, superficial 
changes in this situation will resolve nothing. 
  But if the changes are deeper, they will set mechanisms in 
motion in the people's soul and energies will awaken which 
nobody will be able to influence. The ideas of Orthodox 
statehood are so deep and so ingrained in the mystical essence 
of the elemental national spirit that if anybody were to really 
decide to play with these issues, I am more than certain that he 
would end up with a quite unpredictable result. 
  As for specific issues related to various names, we must be 
fully aware that the house of the Romanovs is extremely 
disjointed as of today. And, say, the attitude toward the best 
known representatives of this house in Russia--Mariya 
Vladimirovna, Leonida Georgiyevna, and the "heir" Georgiy are 
extremely diverse. For example, the association of the house of 
Romanovs flatly refuses to recognize their grand ducal status. 
So any attempts today to resolve this problem through any kind 
of force of will are doomed to failure. One would have to be 
extremely naive not to understand the objectives pursued by 
present-day propagandists of this kind of false "restoration." 
  And speaking about a synod, the fact is that a real synod 
must follow Church canons and Russian national traditions. And 
if we look at the history of Russian synods we will discover 
that they have a number of features that make it extremely 
difficult to perform any kind of political manipulations with 
them. People today who try to use the synod idea for their own 
purposes would be forced either to pass off some unauthorized 
assemblage as a synod or else encounter insurmountable 
difficulties. 
  I think it is now time to set certain "pre-synod" mechanisms 
in motion in Russia. We must contribute in all ways to the 
creation of various public forms of self-organization which 
could then become support points in preparing for the Assembly 
of the Land. And then sooner or later this process would reach 
its logical conclusion. But a real synod would occur when it 
actually unites the Russian people, when its result is 
all-national, nationwide solidarity around the single high ideal 
that enables Rus to rise up to its full height and the 
people--to recall their ancient historical roots and recognize 
their ultimate religious-moral calling. 
  And when the people, having recognized this, freely say: 
"Oh, 
Lord, we recognize your commandments as our laws, our 
obligations, our mission, and our duty and we will act and build 
our personal and state life in accordance with them"--then this 
will be a synod and it could elect a monarch. 
  [Prokhanov] It does not have to be a Romanov? 
  [Ioann] Of course not. The fact is that the "legal 
jurisdiction" of the synod is unlimited because it expresses the 
opinion of all the Russian land in keeping with the moral and 
religious norms and rests on the unshakable foundation of the 
all-beneficent and all-perfect law of God. 
  [Prokhanov] Modern political scientists use the term "social 
psychology." In analytical centers and groups there are social 
psychologists who investigate the social psychological 
background in which various measures are to occur. Of course 
this is a precise, refined specialty which uses research 
methodology. The professionals manage to understand the 
condition of people's minds over horizontal and vertical cross 
sections over the entire area of Russia. But modern society has 
very inadequate instruments for understanding the spiritual 
condition of the people. 
  It was thought that in an atheistic society this "sensorium" 
would be culture. The artist, the writer "fulfilled the duty" of 
a spiritual guide. And he tried as hard as he could to fill this 
role, partially replacing the clergyman--the person who was 
supposed to professionally understand the very problem of the 
spirit. Otherwise how could one perceive the spiritual condition 
of the human being or the society while denying the existence of 
a soul as such and not understanding those processes, the 
sinusoid along which the soul moves from birth, from the 
rapturous entry into life through the fall into sin, through the 
attempts to avoid or exculpate sin, through the spiritual 
achievement.... 
  And now today when the Church, for which, of course, it is 
also very difficult, is nonetheless increasing its influence, 
its power, its luminescence, you are accepting many people--both 
Orthodox and non-Orthodox--as a spiritual leader, as a person 
filled with radiant knowledge, as a spiritual guide who has a 
theological view of present-day Russia. It is no wonder people 
are drawn to you. I would like to ask you yourself: Is there now 
a word, a formula, an idea that could help Russians to unite, 
join together, surmount the schism, the growing hostility, and 
prevent a catastrophic upheaval? And if the time for the 
monarchic idea has not yet come, on what basis is it now 
possible to unite the nation? 
  [Ioann] In the first place, it seems to me that we are on 
the 
threshold of a catastrophic upheaval. One of the most important 
results of the October events is the substantiated conclusion 
that civil war in Russia is almost impossible today. It would be 
very difficult to start it. You spoke about social 
psychologists. But in Russia all the social technologies 
launched for purposes of its destruction, which have been 
repeatedly tested, calculated, and substantiated in a gigantic 
many-century experiment, have failed. None of them has produced 
the expected result. They have been realized almost fully--by 80 
or 90 percent. But this "almost" has always canceled out the 
final result. 
  Academician Shafarevich once noted that the concept 
"Russophobia" is justified in both of its meanings. There is 
hatred for Russians and there is fear of them. Where does this 
fear come from? The fact is that those masonic mechanisms that 
work beautifully throughout the rest of the world do not work 
here in Russia. After all, they have been tested repeatedly by 
the world underground! Everyone seemed to be counting on them, 
but in Russia--they do not work. And this happens because social 
psychology and rationalistic science in general are not capable 
of carrying out in Russia those tasks that have been set by her 
destroyers. 
  Every science has its own area of application. In order to 
understand Russia, in order to function intelligently here, it 
is necessary to have an understanding of laws of a spiritual 
nature, a complete and clear knowledge of which is preserved 
only by the Orthodox Church. Throughout two millennia it has 
stored not only the truths revealed from above concerning God, 
but also concerning man and the harmonious social structure of 
our earthly existence. 
  As for the unification of the people, it seems to me that it 
has already occurred to a considerable degree. The very fact of 
your question is evidence of this. Today everyone is looking for 
something to unite us. And this search in and of itself is that 
powerful unifying principle which in time will consolidate all 
of us, all Russian people, around the age-old spiritual ideals 
of Holy Rus. 
  In recent years a very considerable event has occurred in 
the 
life of Russia. There has been a recognition of the fact that we 
are living wrongly, and that in order to correct this--so that 
we will begin to live in keeping with our theological calling--a 
certain breakthrough must be made. And the fact that this 
question is now rising to its full height in the Russian 
national consciousness is a very powerful unifying factor. 
  But we must not hurry things. Take, for example, the power 
in 
the state. During the past year its slogans have changed 
radically. Before our eyes the regime has evolved in the 
direction of national interests, in the direction of searching 
for a unique form of statehood. This is no accident. Many people 
are now saying that the people "up above" are simply afraid of 
losing power and this is why they are building on patriotic 
slogans. Let us assume that this is true. 
  But that is not the point. Life itself is forcing the 
authorities to move in the necessary direction. And all of 
Russia's enemies are afraid of this. They know that if given a 
chance to develop peacefully if only for 10 years--the 
many-century, gigantic impetus of national collectivism and 
great-power statehood in various forms will inevitably lead 
Russia onto the main path of revival of Holy Rus. After all the 
historical catastrophes, Russia has always been restored in a 
new capacity, even more powerful and glorious. 
  [Prokhanov] I, who am not really a Church person, a secular, 
everyday person, who has occasion to communicate with people of 
the Church, know the idea that the life of the Church is 
essentially a spiritual metaphor of the life of Jesus Christ in 
all of its manifestations: From the birth, the flight to Egypt, 
the fast, the entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, and the 
confession--to the cup at Gethsemane, to handing him over to 
those who would destroy him, to the agony on the cross and death 
on Golgotha, to the placement in the grave and--the resurrection. 
  Since the Russian people are the bearers of the Christian 
idea, their fate throughout history has also been to a certain 
degree a metaphor for the life of Christ. That being the case, 
various periods in Russian life are like icons in the 
iconostasis of the life of Jesus. It is quite obvious that the 
terrible slaughter and persecution of the Church after the 1917 
revolution were its agony on the cross. And the Church's quiet, 
the speechlessness that prevailed after this on our earth 
reminds one of the death of the Savior and his three-day 
departure from the world. 
  And then something new began, like an awakening. I do not 
know if Christ arose in this sense, whether the angel pushed 
aside the gravestone, but it is clear that a new period began. 
Which icon from Christ's life do we have now, in your opinion, 
which stage of His life is Russian society, the Russian people, 
the Russian spirit experiencing now? 
  [Ioann] Here we must keep in mind that such analogies must 
be 
drawn with extreme caution and reverence because, unfortunately, 
even the well-intentioned part of society, going back to its 
Church roots and not having sufficient Church experience, 
sometimes goes too far in its desire to penetrate into the 
spiritual mysteries of Orthodoxy. One must be gradual, fearful, 
and reverent when approaching the holy and be clearly aware that 
ultimately at the foundation of being lies God's mystery, 
unknowable and rationally inexpressible. 
  "This mystery is great," the Holy Scripture teaches us. It 
can be perceived within the framework of a profoundly intimate, 
personal religious experience, when the human heart encounters 
God, and this personal meeting gives a person a certain 
understanding that "the ear does not hear, the eye does not see, 
and the heart does ache" in the ordinary earthly life. 
  The history of the Russian people and the parallels you have 
drawn with evangelical events, of course, are correct, taking 
into account all the conditions I mentioned. The crucifixion of 
Rus in this comparison is "superimposed" on the crucifixion of 
Christ and the Savior's subsequent entry into public service. 
The hardships experienced by Rus throughout its turbulent 
history evoke clear associations with the sorrows, oppression, 
and persecution experienced by the Savior during His life on 
earth. A comparison is suggested between his sufferings on 
Golgotha and what our people and our country have had to endure 
in the 20th century. And it is quite possible that we are now 
standing on the threshold of Resurrection. 
  But in order for a miracle to occur we need the power of 
faith. If we are able to preserve and increase this power within 
ourselves, then the many prophecies about the Resurrection of 
Holy Rus will come true...let me speak about the concrete 
conditions for the Resurrection: Until the Church pervades 
society, the Russian Resurrection will not occur fully. Until 
the intelligentsia overcomes its innate illness--intellectual 
pride--until it recognizes the primary, saving significance of 
strict Church forms of spiritual life, the revival will not 
occur. 
  Modernism and liberalism are fatal in the area of the 
religious world view. The divine truth does not require 
"updating" or augmentation. From mankind it requires only 
efforts to perceive it, to join with it. Until this happens, we 
will not resurrect Holy Rus. But today we are still too strongly 
afflicted with pride and self-will, which, incidentally, also 
led Russia to the revolution 80 years ago. And to this day we 
think: We have stumbled, and we can put ourselves 
aright--without God's help. No, we cannot put ourselves aright! 
And until we recognize this our domestic rod and staff of 
sorrows sent by the Lord will persecute us, being the instrument 
of the all-beneficent divinity who is concerned about our 
spiritual enlightenment. 
  [Prokhanov] According to Christian teaching, the end of 
history is coming, the Terrible Judgment, the end of this 
sin-filled era. But until the Terrible Judgment occurs, mankind, 
as before, will be concerned about the fate of his homeland, the 
condition of resources, institutions, war, schools, roads, and 
the condition of our minds. People think about geopolitics and 
interrelations with our neighbors, and all of our hopes are 
bound up in the well-being of our homeland. Many people 
understand today that the style and character of life that are 
associated with modern earthly civilization have exhausted 
themselves. This civilization is coming to its end--smoothly in 
some places, and in some places terrifyingly and 
catastrophically. 
  Is a new situation coming to earth, a new way of life which 
people are trying to anticipate, to figure out, and some are 
even trying to build it. Some speak about a certain ecological 
civilization where every creature, and every plant will live in 
harmony; others discuss a sensory civilization where striving 
for material goods will recede into the background and the 
mechanism for religious, philosophical, and rational 
consciousness will come into play. Still others have in mind a 
new, super-integrated earth with rational utilization of the 
remnants of the earth's wealth, the kind of neosocialism, the 
kind of worldwide phalanx that will make it possible to maintain 
universal order. 
  Which is the true one for Russia? Perhaps the image of the 
17th century when it was prepared to be transformed into a 
single monastery, or Russia at the turn of the 20th century, 
when our realm began to acquire the features of earthly, 
material well-being? 
  How would you like to see our homeland? 
  [Ioann] In order to answer this question we must first solve 
the well-known human puzzle: What is the meaning of life? Any 
ideal of social structure, any form of harmonious coexistence of 
people on earth is possible only when people live thoughtfully, 
understanding the purpose of their existence, and build their 
life in keeping with this. 
  The Church gives a completely clear and direct answer to 
this. Of course it has nothing to do with any kind of "sensory 
civilization." It is simple but very difficult to perceive for 
modern humankind, which is excessively caught up in and bogged 
down by the passions of vainglory and pride. The meaning and 
purpose of human life is to return to ourselves that initial 
heavenly combination of purity and holiness, when the human 
heart was inaccessible to evil and sin, the condition Adam and 
Eve were in after the creation, in Eden. The main thing is to 
return to ourselves that invaluable treasure of lost 
communication with God. One of the greatest Orthodox saints, the 
holy Augustine, once said: "The Lord created us for himself and 
the human heart will not be at rest until it unites with Him." 
  Look: Mankind is constantly striving; fighting wars and 
changing boundaries, destroying and creating again, pushing it 
knows not where. This unquenchable thirst for feverish activity, 
the thirst for new things ensues from the fact that the sacred 
heart is empty. The human heart was created as a valuable vessel 
for receiving the gifts of the Holy Spirit. After the fall it 
was deprived of them, and now it is fatally ill. 
  So the Church is the hospital for the soul. And a society 
will be built well when it does everything possible to make sure 
that this hospital is able to treat the human soul most 
effectively, calmly, and peacefully. 
  Russian history knows how the state, social, and economic 
life of the country and the people must be constructed in order 
to accomplish this. Thus, for example, in Russia it is 
impossible to build a healthy economy on the philosophical 
foundation of a "consumer society." This is unthinkable. The 
Holy Scripture teaches us: "Seek first the kingdom of God and 
its truth and the rest shall be given unto you" (Matt. 7:33). 
  It is impossible to build the economic life of Russia based 
on the capitalist principle of unlimited reproduction of goods 
and services. This is absurd. The Lord said: "What good does it 
do man if he acquires the whole earth but his soul is in pain?" 
(Matt. 8:36). The philosophical basis for our life must be 
different from what it is today. 
  All the external riches in this world given to man by God 
are 
concentrated and available for use; there is nothing prejudicial 
or illegal in them. But we must not use them to defile ourselves 
and those around us but, relying on the beneficent properties of 
this world with which the Lord generously imbued it, help our 
soul to restore itself to its initial condition of divine purity. 
  When people say that the conservatism of the Church could 
throw society back 200-300 years, that is stupid. It is 
impossible to go back 10 years, not to mention 300. But to 
restore in society that ancient spiritual tradition with which 
Russia lived for a thousand years is absolutely necessary. 
Religion presupposes a link between man and God. And just as the 
separate human individual has his duty to God, so the collective 
individual of the Russian people has its particular duty to Him. 
  It was advantageous to God in His infinite wisdom to entrust 
the truth of faith to be preserved and protected by various 
peoples. First it was entrusted to the people of Israel, but 
they did not keep these truths, they were not worthy of their 
high calling, and after the terrible crime of deicide they were 
rejected, expelled from holy service. 
  Then this mission was turned over to another people, the 
"people of God"--the Christians, who initially were concentrated 
in the great-power state body of the Roman Empire. 
  But in the 12th century when Rome introduced inadmissible 
dogmatic innovations and fell away from the universal fullness 
of Orthodoxy, its mission was also taken away and turned over to 
Byzantium (the second Rome). It performed it for several 
centuries, but in the 15th century as a result of the most 
powerful military and political pressure it was unable to 
maintain the proper purity and decided to unite with the 
Catholics, that is, it allowed a distortion of the divine faith. 
  Then the duty of the keeper of the Truth went to the Russian 
Orthodox state, to the Russian people, understood as a 
collective spiritual community. We must constantly be aware of 
our responsibility for our mission, following it in everything, 
and build our lives in keeping with our religious duty. Only 
then will we be able to restore the Russia God needs, which will 
become a kind of precious shrine, keeping inviolable and pure 
the ideals of mercy and love, justice and truth, generosity and 
benevolence. 
  [Prokhanov] I recall that in my youth I was captivated by 
patriarch Nikon, and in our circles there were "Old Believers" 
whose idol was archpriest Avvakum. I was Orthodox, a specialist 
in public law, and a Nikonian, and I frequently visited New 
Jerusalem, and all of a sudden it dawned on me: Nikon was 
waiting for the Second Coming of Christ, he wanted to transform 
Russia into a place where the New Jerusalem could exist. He 
thought the Second Coming would occur in Russia. Apparently the 
majority of Russian people believed and expected that Christ 
would come to Rus, that there would be a Russian Second Coming. 
And in order to invite Christ to this place, the New Jerusalem 
was created, where on the suburban Moscow landscape, among the 
suburban Moscow woods, on the Istra River a place with the name 
of the holy places would be created. There were the Jordan, 
Bethlehem, Golgotha, and Favor.... 
  I was struck by the grand scale of this plan. In essence it 
was as though Nikon had changed the coordinates of the earth, 
trying thus to change the cosmic coordinates, shifting the 
meaning and center of history to Moscow. 
  If I have understood you correctly, the ideal of the future 
Russia should amount to preparing through Russia a place for the 
arrival of God, making it agreeable to Christ, and in this sense 
somehow making the image of the homeland more like the New 
Jerusalem, to the extent that this is possible in the 
terrestrial hypostasis.... 
  [Ioann] Not at all, Nikon did not have that kind of pride. 
The building of the New Jerusalem was simply a "material" 
embodiment of the spiritual fact that Russia recognizes and 
accepts its religious mission. But the Second Coming should 
never be discussed too simplistically. This event must be 
awaited in reverential fear and spiritual trembling. 
  While the Savior came first "in the form of a slave" in 
order 
to serve the people, His Second Coming will be "in power and 
glory" in order to judge us according to our deeds. And nobody 
will have to ask: "Where is the Christ?" All will be able to see 
Him, "A bolt of lighting flashing from the East to the West." 
  When the Orthodox ascetics asked how they would know the 
Antichrist, they frequently received the following answer: 
"Sons, if you hear that Christ has arrived somewhere, you will 
know that it is the Antichrist" because when the Lord actually 
comes everyone will understand instantly because this will be 
the coming of the Lord and Master of the Universe, the creator 
of all that is, who is infinite in his accomplishments and his 
wisdom. 
  As for spiritual images, everything here is fairly clear and 
simple: Russia as the universal repository and defender of Holy 
Orthodoxy is the "footstool of the throne of the Lord." This 
understanding has matured in Russian religious self-awareness 
over many centuries and it was formulated most clearly right 
before the revolution by our great saint, the all-Russian man of 
righteousness and prayer Father Ioann Kronshtadskiy. "To be born 
a Russian," he said, "is the gift of a certain mission. For in 
the Church there are no nationalities, 'there are no Greeks or 
Jews'; it distinguishes people only according to their missions. 
There is the Tsarist mission, there is the patriarchal mission, 
there is the monastic mission, there is the secular mission." 
  So the Russian mission, at once sacrificial and heroic, 
lofty 
and humble, human and universal, is to be until the end of time 
an obstacle on the path of the evil that is pressing for earthly 
power, to stand until death defending divine truths in the 
sacred objects of the faith. 
  As long as we remember this, Holy Rus will live, 
unconquerable and a source of terror for our enemies and God's! 
And for our faithfulness to our duty and the work we do the Lord 
will grant his warriors a great and eternal recompense, all the 
blessings of which cannot be accommodated by our present 
pathetic human imagination.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "ZAVTRA Against Luzhkov"] </F>
  [Text] Luzhkov brought the suit to court. This obese 
gentleman diving into a hole in the ice was offended at ZAVTRA. 
The newspaper had published an article by I. Ivanov entitled 
"Third Power," in which Luzhkov is accused of bloodletting. 
Luzhkov, "whose role in the cruel treatment of the demonstrators 
on 23 February and 1 May is well known." This is what was said 
in the article. 
  He denies the blame and, striking an indignant pose, is 
demanding an apology from us. 
  We will not give him any apology and we are going to court 
asserting: Yes, Luzhkov is to blame for the bloody events in 
Moscow on 23 February 1992 and 1 May and 4 October 1993. He is 
also to blame for the bloodshed. This is shown by documents we 
have at our disposal and the testimony of victims. The 
procurator's investigation of this case was suspended but, 
taking it to court, we are resuming this investigation. 
  We hope that all Muscovites who were brutally beaten by 
Luzhkov's special-purpose militia detachment during the 
demonstrations on 23 February and 1 May, all relatives of those 
who died during the brutal storming of the House of Soviets on 4 
October, all people's deputies who were tortured by Luzhkov's 
men in the driveways and in the militia departments will come to 
the courthouse on 5 April 1994. We ourselves will testify about 
how Luzhkov's commandos broke into the editorial offices of DEN 
with automatic rifles and conducted a pogrom. 
  We are not afraid of losing, we are not afraid of the 
corrupt 
bureaucrats in the mayor's office. ZAVTRA, like DEN before it, 
is acting to defend the people. 
  Luzhkov wants to become the president of Russia. We are 
doing 
everything we can to make sure that this does not happen. So 
that the terror and shame of Moscow does not spread throughout 
our homeland. So that the depravity, gangsterism, drug 
addiction, whoring, bribery, corruption of morals, destruction 
of culture, and trampling on the individual do not become the 
norm in the cities and villages of Russia. 
  Luzhkov is a new type of authority who has crawled out of 
rotting Yeltsinism, cruel and merciless, relying on shady 
capital, passing himself off as someone who cares about the 
people. Issuing from this power is a new disaster the likes of 
which Russia has never seen before, but it is known quite well 
by Latin American peoples who have been transformed into slaves 
by "death squadrons." 
  All who value freedom and honor, who do not want a Luzhkov 
dictatorship, come on 5 April at 1000 to the Leninskiy Rayon 
Court at the following address: 7 Rostovskiy Lane, Building 21, 
Room No. 5.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee on Security, recorded by Olga Timofeyeva: "Power Has 
Been Corrupted From Bottom to Top"] 
  [Text] The main threat to Russia's national security is 
undoubtedly domestic in nature, although it is manifested 
through external influence as well. Of course, I do not mean 
direct military aggression. 
  The most important task today is to preserve the country's 
unity, so that the Russian state will not become a "patchwork 
quilt." It is also necessary to provide for Russia's sovereign 
right to dispose of its own wealth: minerals, strategic raw 
material, gold reserves, precious metals, and so forth. We must 
not allow our country to become some kind of colonial appendage. 
If foreign investors and foreign firms are able to penetrate 
deeply into our economy and financial system, Russia will lose 
its sovereignty and national independence, and without military 
aggression. 
  Many people today think that Russia is surrounded only by 
well-wishers. This is a profoundly erroneous position. 
Unfortunately, we have opened wide not only our doors but also 
Russia's borders for penetration of everyone and anyone and we 
have removed all restrictions on access to what was previously 
closed. We have foreigners as advisers to the president and 
government, advisers in the economic structures and financial 
system. Foreigners already have their hands on our property and 
have made their way to our property and have made their way to 
our natural resources. In think this is an uncontrolled 
process--a far from normal phenomenon. But if we begin to 
rectify the situation, I do not rule out the possibility of 
strong pressure on Russia from the states of the West. In other 
words, we have many friends as long as we allow them to operate 
without restriction in the country. But as soon as we raise the 
question of restricting their freedom of activity, their 
attitude toward us changes. 
  I am in favor of national accord, and on this plane I am 
prepared for any interaction with the government and 
presidential structures. But under the condition that they will 
take into account at least the interests of the majority of the 
population, the main social strata. Because when the hungry, the 
unclothed, and the unshod continue to be poor and on an ever 
larger scale and the well-off and the rich increasingly rob the 
poor and down and out with ever greater frenzy, no national 
reconciliation can be achieved. For the sake of universal peace 
and harmony, the course of the so-called economic reforms must 
be changed. 
  No less crucial is the problem of fighting crime and 
corruption. I think that with the present course of the reforms, 
if it is possible to stop their growth at all it is only for the 
time being. Because the social basis of this phenomenon will not 
be eliminated. In the section of Yeltsin's message devoted to 
crime I was struck by the frequent use of expressions like 
"needed," "necessary," and "must," meaning the government, the 
Duma, and the Federal Assembly as a whole. But who has been 
keeping the president from fighting crime up to this point? 
After all, he is the one responsible for the government; 
according to the Constitution he is the one who guarantees 
observance of the rights and freedoms of the citizens and is 
responsible for protecting their interests. And he, the 
president, is the end point of the power structures. So what has 
Yeltsin done to fight crime during his reign besides issue empty 
declarations which we hear in every one of his speeches? 
  Our problem is that the laws are not being obeyed, and not 
least of all--by the president himself. Moreover, the current 
authorities are corrupt from bottom to top and they are never 
going to fight against themselves. Now the post of procurator 
general has been filled by Ilyushenko--a member of the infamous 
"interdepartmental commission." It is difficult to imagine a 
greater tragedy for the procuracy or greater harm to law and 
order in Russia. During the past three years the procuracy has 
lived through three procurator generals and, unfortunately, each 
has been worse than his predecessor in terms of professional 
qualities and persistence in defending the law. Knowing the 
procuracy system and many of its workers well, I can state that 
Ilyushenko will not be taken seriously either by the apparatus 
or by the workers in the localities. And this will have a 
negative effect on the state of procuratorial oversight and the 
organization of the fight against crime. 
  As before, the current authorities will limit themselves to 
exposing only individual cases of corruption and wage the battle 
against it in insignificant forms. The foundation, the essence 
of this phenomenon that is tearing society apart will remain 
untouched. As before, corruption in the higher echelons of power 
will be beyond the reach of anyone who would expose it, and that 
is the saddest part. Honest procuracy investigators and judges 
will perform their professional and civil duties in fear of 
losing their positions, their jobs. There are plenty of examples 
of punishment of principled, "obstinate" workers of law 
enforcement organs. 
  But still, even under the current unfavorable conditions, a 
fight against crime can and should be waged. The first contacts 
between deputies who are members of the committee on security 
and law enforcement organs inspire a certain amount of hope. We 
have already concluded an agreement with the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation concerning joint 
development of legislative acts aimed at stepping up this 
battle. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has assigned a group of 
its own specialists--scholars and experts. We are also arranging 
similar contacts with the Ministry of Justice and the Procuracy. 
We have held work meetings with representatives of the Security 
Council. We have a certain understanding and we can work 
together. 
  Still, in my view, serious progress in this area will be 
possible only with certain changes in the leadership of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and the discharge from the law 
enforcement system workers in all of its areas who compromise 
themselves. It would not be a bad idea for such a "purge" to 
simultaneously affect government structures, administration 
chiefs, and presidential representatives in the localities. 
People must be recruited not according to the principle of 
personal loyalty to the leaders but according to the principle 
of professionalism in combination with steadfastness, honesty, 
and devotion to the people. It would be desirable to take all 
these urgent measures in concert with effective law making, 
improvement of the moral situation in society, and, undoubtedly, 
improvement of the well-being of the people. 
  The first work sessions of our committee revealed a certain 
uniformity of views among its members and a similarity in the 
assessments of the situation and the security of Russia. We have 
declared a need to adopt a law on corruption. We are preparing 
for hearings in the State Duma of a draft law on protection of 
judges, procurators, and workers of other law enforcement 
organs. We have announced a law on protection of victims and 
witnesses. We are working on a draft law that would regulate the 
extraction, production, transportation, and sale of strategic 
materials, precious metals, and gold. 
  In my view, the political amnesty declared by the State Duma 
was an important state toward national accord. The question of 
restoration of justice with respect to the people arrested and 
taken to court for the events of 19-21 August 1991, and 1 May, 
21 September-4 October 1994 was raised by the opposition long 
ago, and above all by the Communist Party. This was a point in 
their election platform and a kind of mandate from the voters. 
  An awareness of the fact that the investigation of these 
cases that has been started and their examination in court will 
not reveal the objective truth and hence will not be fair has 
gradually come to many of the deputies. They have also 
understood that Russian society cannot be constantly in a state 
of civil war, we must get out of this situation somehow, because 
confrontation threatens us with graver consequences. Therefore 
an attempt has been made to find at least certain areas of 
mutual understanding among various factions in the Duma, and we 
have adopted a memorandum on accord. Amnesty is the first step 
toward building bridges among various groups in parliament and 
thus in our society.

<F P=106> [Article by Major General Viktor Filatov: "Army, Save </F>
Russia! Outlines of a Secret Plan"] 
  [Text] Amnesty and freedom--are they the same thing? One 
time I happened to be in Surgut and I could not restrain 
myself--I visited a famous site there--the hard labor colony. In 
terms of the number of "personnel"--1,600 people--it was no 
different from a full-fledged motorized infantry regiment! I 
know barracks: from those of flyers and people serving on 
submarines to those special forces and construction battalions. 
In the sleeping quarters, the dining room, the recreation 
facilities, and the work places in the Surgut hard labor colony, 
at least externally, things were better than in our units and 
subdivisions. The prisoners in the camp looked more cheerful and 
sharper than the soldiers in our garrisons. The commander of the 
colony was a colonel, just as colonels are at the "helm" of our 
divisions almost everywhere.... 
  The "outside" and "demobilization"--what is the difference? 
If they were "taken" or "called up"--how are these different? 
"There" they begin with being "arrested" by the militia, and 
"here"--"recruitment" to the military commissariat. "There" they 
begin with the "agenda" and "here"--the same thing. "There"--"a 
training school" and "here"--"a training school"... 
  But the soldier does not have such a benefit as--amnesty. 
For 
the soldier it is all the way, as for murder. This is true: Our 
army is constantly being threatened with cutbacks, but this does 
not affect people serving their stint on active duty, but for 
officers it means banishment, falling to the bottom. In any case 
amnesty is to the benefit of the government--the benefactor!--it 
always adds those who receive amnesty to the ranks of its 
supporters. The part of the army that is cut back is always an 
army against the government. 
  Today, in addition to everything else, the army knows that 
on 
4 October 1993 it was drawn, through deceit, into the dirty and 
bloody affair against its own people. With its help the regime, 
albeit only apparent and implied, held on--and this is called 
"digging in its heels." The army would not be likely to make the 
same mistake again. 
  Now Yeltsin has a problem--how to get back the written order 
he gave to Grachev for the tanks to fire on the House of 
Soviets. It turns out that Pasha is not that simple--he...took 
it and "lost" it. The entire Ministry of Defense and General 
Staff are "looking" for it today. 
  Amnesty has always been declared in honor of victory and the 
victors. The present amnesty is in honor of the new 
constitution, which essentially legitimizes the regime of 
occupation and plundering of the country. Whose victory is it, 
who is the victor? The new constitution, like any constitution, 
must be defended. But who will defend this one? Logically, if it 
is in honor of the new constitution, the criminals will walk 
through the gates of the camps, and from the moment of their 
release they will defend it. In general has anyone thought about 
the words "the government took advantage of criminals and 
criminal elements for its own interests"? What does this mean 
concretely? 
  It took approximately two years to prepare the army for war 
against fascist Germany: In 1938 it was a standing army, like 
the Germans', and in 1939 a law was adopted concerning universal 
military service, just as the Germans had. Today the Moscow 
rulers are shouting to all the world: A terrible internal enemy 
has appeared in Russia--Russian nationalism. The 
internationalists have a precise formula for this: If the enemy 
does not give up, destroy him. And such things require a strong, 
well-trained army. 
  Approximately two years ago Yeltsin headed up a commission 
on 
fighting crime. All the jails are now overflowing. There are 
three or four people for every bunk. But crime is growing 
immensely. Why? Did they arrest the wrong ones? They "arrested" 
the ones they needed--young people who had been in Afghanistan, 
who had served in the army, former militiamen, workers of the 
Committee on Security--in a word, the military commissariats 
were working, and they were "drafted into the army." 
  Now 220,000 criminals are free. A "small but modern 
army"--the "Kremlin sergeants" say now. The only thing is that 
it is "small" in mind as well. 
  The authorities already purport to be concerned that in 
April-May there could be a "social upheaval." Could this not 
happen at 0400 on 22 June? Why April-May? Is it not because by 
that date it will be possible to "release from the ranks" those 
220,000 amnestied "demobilized" people, to "relocate" them, to 
station them so that they will be able to look around the 
localities, go on "reconnaissance" missions, look over the 
future "battlefield"?... 
  Two years these young people who are supposed to be 
criminals 
have spent in "training school." The brigade--the platoon, the 
shop, section--the battalion...every platoon, every battalion 
has its number. The "battalion of defenders of the Kremlin No. 
666"...throughout the entire world they are called "death 
squadrons." 
  But that will come later; first--the circles of prison camp 
hell. The masters there since the times of the NKVD [People's 
Commissariat of Internal Affairs] People's Commissar Iyeguda, 
for Russians Yagoda. He was the organizer and inspiration for 
the GULags of 1931-1938. Among the GULag chiefs was his 
kinsman-Berman. 
  During this period the main thing is to be able to crush a 
person as an individual, to frighten him to the point of animal 
terror so that it seems to him that there is no way out, and if 
there is, there is only one--the noose. It is impossible to 
bring the present-day criminal to such a condition in the 
camp--he is at home there, he is his own person there. But it is 
the criminal--the sadist and the pervert, the drug addict and 
the tuberculosis patient, the psychiatric patient and the 
torturer--they perform this "educational work" under the wise 
leadership of the "citizen boss." The criminal is like the 
division commander, the senior man in a regiment of new recruits. 
  In the language of criminals, a person who has committed a 
"minor offense" and is in jail, not knowing what for--this 
person is an "ox." And after the "ox" is already beginning to 
try the noose on his neck for size, suddenly the "citizen boss" 
says to him approximately the following: "A new constitution has 
been adopted. It has been signed by President Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin. According to this constitution Yeltsin is fighting for 
your amnesty. Pray for Boris Nikolayevich because out there, on 
the outside, he has many enemies. They do not want you to have 
amnesty but our president is a go-getter..." and he gives the 
person, as they say nowadays, a light at the end of the tunnel. 
The "ox" goes around to everyone explaining that "our own 
father, the savior Yeltsin" must be protected, and there is 
nobody on the outside except him to stand up for the "ox" and 
there are enemies out there: fascists and nationalists. "Do you 
agree?"--This is how the "government has taken advantage of 
criminals for its own purposes." 
  In the colonies and camps this or approximately this was the 
way they asked the people they needed right after Yeltsin pushed 
his constitution through. But this question was raised 
especially pointedly after 4 October 1993. At that time Gaydar 
called out into the streets of Moscow those same "oxen," but 
they were "demobilized" in a different way: "For good 
work"--ahead of schedule. As they say: "Master, the assignment 
has been carried out." 
  In April-May of this year a real "small but modern army" 
will 
be put to work. They will think long and hard, for example, 
about such a "special case" as when the military general and 
hero of Afghanistan Gromov suddenly, when Yazov was still in 
office, became deputy minister of internal affairs. As a 
counterbalance to the patriot and statesman Yazov? To train a 
regular professional army against the internal enemy, about 
which we had not heard a single thing at the time? 
  A few more than 220,000 people are now being released--not 
many more than there were in the 40th Army with Gromov as 
commander. The regimental horizons were calculated and taken 
into account. 
  The patriots: "Hoorah! Our victory!" It is not much of a 
victory when criminals grant freedom to honest people and seem 
to change places with them. The patriots must clarify: This 
amnesty is the beginning of a large-scale operation. It was 
begun by forces that fired from tanks at the House of Soviets. 
Then there was a concrete task--to destroy soviet power. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Yushenkov--a teacher of Marxism-Leninism 
at the Academy imeni Lenin and now one of the fiercest 
supporters of the occupiers, does not conceal the fact that 
amnesty will be the beginning of a civil war in which they, the 
"democrats," will destroy "Russian fascism," meaning everything 
that is national and Russian from time immemorial. 
  They planned this amnesty way back two years ago. "Taking 
advantage" of the Duma's patriotism, they released about a dozen 
of "our" people. Anpilov, for example, immediately took up his 
"atom bomb"--the microphone...but "they" used this amnesty to 
create and mobilize an entire army. It went through its "combat 
training" in such model-demonstration hard labor camps as I saw 
in Surgut. 
  In April-May everything will be like in training sessions 
where they choose up sides: The "reds" will be ardently in favor 
of...the Kremlin, the "blues" will persistently defend and 
protect...the Kremlin. For a large combat training maneuver they 
usually plan for 15-20 corpses, and the causes of death vary, 
but, as a rule, they are caused by carelessness and drunkenness. 
The "reds" and the "blues" are only conventional designations 
for soldiers of the same army of "Kremlin sergeants." Each only 
depicts the opponent, the enemy. 
  More than 15 or 20 corpses are planned for the Kremlin walls 
during April-May. Everything is envisioned, even what Yeltsin 
will say at the funerals. In addition to everything else, he 
will announce an edict there concerning the introduction of a 
state of emergency throughout the country for two years. 
  "Victory!" Yushenkov will shout heart-rendingly. And the 
appointees will rush to their places. To all the posts and 
positions. For two years. And "our people" will be returned to 
their cubicles. 
  The journalists and Poltoranin are worried that there will 
be 
no money for paper. How Poltoranin toys with them! He knows that 
in a month or two all these problems will evaporate because all 
that will be left will be two or three occupation newspapers 
like IZVESTIYA and MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, and there will be 
plenty of paper for them. 
  And they should not delude themselves and placate themselves 
with the idea that confusion and even panic, incoherence and 
even hostility will constantly reign in the Kremlin's corridors. 
This will occur on the floors housing the uninitiated. That is 
the way it is designed. You must know Yeltsin. When he was first 
secretary of the Moscow City Committee he had two party city 
committees: One was his own personal one, almost his family, 
which did all the work, and the city committee which all 
Muscovites knew--it signed papers and hung flags throughout 
Moscow on revolutionary holidays. 
  And today there are two Kremlins: One Kremlin makes the 
decisions and the other one runs around making stupid 
announcements, conducts pointless news conferences, squabbles, 
intrigues, they scheme against one another, and, looking 
intelligent, make predictions and produce models. But all these 
are people "researchers." But they are not allowed within 
machine gun range of Yeltsin's holy of holies. So "that Kremlin" 
works, like a finely tuned mechanism, without interruptions and 
failures. Ultimately to hell with them, with this "second 
Kremlin," if there were any improvement in the country. But, 
after all, it is quite the opposite. 
  Is everything calculated? Have we been sentenced? Is there 
no 
way out? But...and again the last hope--our national army. Even 
today it must know that in April-May or a little sooner or a 
little later under the walls of the Kremlin the "reds" released 
under amnesty from the prison camps and the "blues" from the 
same place will earn their "ransom." They will have no 
"refuseniks," there will be none who are timid. Each has placed 
his life on the line--freedom or back to the hell of the 
criminal zone. If there is a person--an article will be 
found!--everybody who has received amnesty knows this is true. 
  They will burn and slaughter, take scalps and disembowel 
people, as in the House of Soviets on 4 October 1993. The 
reason? Luzhkov will permit Anpilov to hold a rally. Luzhkov 
will permit the National Liberation Front to picket the Kremlin, 
etc., etc. 
  Army, save Russia! 
  Three months is all the General Staff will need to bring 
order to the country's economy. It has all the specialists, 
departments, and administrations needed for this. Three months 
is all the army will need to bring order into the country, to 
put an end to the civil war, even that which is blazing in the 
outlying regions, the mafia, and gangsterism in the cities. 
  What next? Next--that is no longer a problem for the army, 
but for the nationally elected Duma. Armies have a task: To pull 
the cart out of the swamp, to put things on a firm basis--and 
then back to the barracks. The clock has been set, the time has 
been checked. The operation against the Russians has entered its 
final phase....

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Knyazev: "Our Newspaper's Holiday"] </F>
  [Text] A view from the spectator hall, row 16, seat 
2, 5 March 1994 
  Prokhanov deserves a vacation. 
  The titanic work for unifying national forces, the 
constantly 
failing attempts to keep all of the largely different leaders in 
the mainstream of the overall idea, the immense mass of 
believers and people who cannot believe should have been crowned 
with a triumph. 
  Prokhanov should have been able to see this overflowing 
hall, 
to hear the approving voices, to rub elbows and backs with those 
advisers who for a long time supported him just as he supported 
them in his newspaper. 
  There were almost no analysts in the hall. They were mainly 
people who carry on their shoulders the pain and offense to Rus, 
its traditions and catastrophes. They live in that same 
"tomorrow" at which the newspaper is aimed, believing in that 
"tomorrow" and doing everything within their power for it. 
Attending meetings, burning bonfires in front of the White 
House, disseminating the newspaper, they give perhaps their last 
rubles for the holy Russian cause. 
  This is a spectator hall. The people are ready at the will 
of 
the leaders to obey the order, to go, to flee, to shout, or to 
moan. The people, without whom there are no leaders, on whom the 
leaders rely, without whom the leaders cannot live. The foremost 
part of our nation. 
  The leaders are on the stage. 
  Anpilov, Konstantinov, Astafyev, Terekhov, Baburin, Pavlov, 
Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov. 
  On the stage are Ilyukhin, Dugin, Penkov, Bondarenko, 
Chikin, 
Filatov. 
  The last six are not leaders themselves. But they are people 
without whose help and support many of the leaders could not get 
by. They are people whose advice and actions are necessary, 
people who are closest, who could independently decide issues 
within the framework of their authority. Very important leaders 
of the second level. 
  All of them spoke. 
  The main theme of the speeches was not to allow ourselves to 
be provoked to armed uprisings which are called "civil war." 
This was discussed by Dugin on the basis of materials from the 
Spanish press and Ilyukhin after the meeting of Vybros on 2 
March. 
  A peaceful scenario for development is possibly less 
preferable to the president and his team, but all of his 
variants have also been played through. And not in our favor. 
  At first Filatov was struck and then he calmed down. He was 
struck by the fact that the 220,000 criminals to whom the 
president gave amnesty make up 10 divisions of his supporters, 
but he was calmed down by the assurance that a victory would 
require only one division and only because it would be led by 
the General Staff. 
  It is very important to have the support of the creative 
intelligentsia in art, which is provided by the Russian part of 
it. This was in the speech by Penkov, an excellent actor and 
human being. 
  Terekhov just got out of Lefortovo. He looks tired but ready 
for more battle. 
  Anpilov, Konstantinov, and Baburin. What is the behavior 
this 
year of the leaders of 1992, when their phrases and slogans were 
valued? 
  Zhirinovskiy is sure of himself. Today is not only a holiday 
for the newspaper, but also a triumph for the opposition who 
opened the doors to Lefortovo and Sailors' Rest. He in no way 
diminishes his role in the Duma. He is the only one who 
supported the State Committee for the State of Emergency. He is 
the only candidate for president. In general he is a unique 
individual. He is not a Russian Hitler--"why pin that label on 
me?" Zhirinovskiy is a candid human being; he has no secrets. He 
wants to be first, and he tries. But his openness makes him 
extremely vulnerable. 
  Mr. Astafyev took advantage of this, teasing Zhirinovskiy a 
little. Astafyev called for unity. This is not new. A unified 
front in the Duma, a single president for all to back in the 
elections. The only thing he did not do was the main thing in 
such a situation, he did not say: "We have before us the only 
person I believe in" and give his name. "I give him my vote and 
the vote of my party. Lead us!" He also failed to say something 
else: "I will take full responsibility for the future of Russia. 
I know not only WHAT, but also HOW to do this for all of us. 
Entrust your fate to me." 
  Nobody said that. 
  The most stirring speech was Nikolay Pavlov's. "We cannot 
believe the government. They are deceiving us again! They have 
already outfitted us with our former clothing of a red and brown 
color! We are again being subjected to the chaos of unemployment 
and internecine war! We need our own Russian national party!" A 
person who threw himself under the bullets and APC's. 
Personally, he is desperately brave. He walks in the vanguard, 
but he is not a leader. 
  And, finally, Zyuganov. His stated dream is a coalition 
government. 
  I bought two brochures containing his speeches and articles 
on the way out. "Peace--to the people, the land--to the 
peasants, the factories--to the workers"--but for today's 
conditions. 
  If there is a need we will have to do a detailed critical 
survey of everything published by Mr. Zyuganov, but what he said 
on 5 March, in my view, does not answer the question of how to 
arrive at victory. 
  They are all patriots. They are all Russians. And the same 
laws of psychology apply to all of them. 
  The first who is prepared to give himself for the good of 
Russia must cease being an egoist. He must take a risk, giving 
himself and his party to another leader, admit that he is not 
the only one with correct ideas. He must agree to be the second 
or third. But how? 
  Petr turned Russia over to the Romanovs. He went to learn. 
Nikolay II--to Stolypin. Rozenfeld and Apfelbaum--to 
Dzhugashvili. There are precedents, and not all unsuccessful 
ones. If there is no one to whom you can be subordinate and you 
cannot take the burden on yourself--admit it! That you are weak, 
that you cannot do it, leave.... 
  The Siberian Petr Romanov in the issue of ZAVTRA printed on 
the night of 5 March did not say HOW either. But he indicated 
the bottom line of answers to the question WHAT. I would give 
exactly the same answer. 
  HOW--the PEOPLE. How are they to act? How much are they to 
sleep, how much are they to earn, if they are responsible--for 
what? Incentives. Which? Measures of encouragement and coercion. 
Who must work and under what conditions? Who must not impede the 
work and what should be done with them? Who should be taught 
what? 
  I do not have a party. I give myself and everything I am 
able 
to do to Petr Romanov. I believe in him and am prepared to share 
with him both the work and the responsibility for it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Zorkin by Aleksandr Prokhanov; place </F>
and date not given: "Instead of Depression--Will to Action"] 
  [Text] [Prokhanov] Russia has had so many troubles since we 
saw each other last summer, so much blood and tears have been 
shed. Even now there is one alarm signal after another. Entire 
regions are dying out, every hour thousands of motors are 
grinding to a halt. The fields have not been planted, the 
children in certain settlements are eating manufactured 
concentrated animal feed. How are we to cope with this 
catastrophe? And in August 1993 again there were rumors of a 
state of emergency, more use of violence against the people, 
opposition.... 
  At this crisis moment we signed the declaration "Accord in 
the Name of Russia"--a kind of broad coalition that unites 
people with various ideological views and values. You, Valeriy 
Dmitriyevich, were at the source of the idea, the main initiator 
of this movement. I signed the document but I still have secret 
doubts--is it possible to have "Accord in the Name of Russia" 
under conditions where we, judging from everything, are 
"rushing" to the peak of a systemic crisis? 
  [Zorkin] You are right: The crisis is accelerating and at 
extremely rapid rates. During January and February of this year 
the decline of industrial production considerably exceeded last 
year's indicators. Economic, social, and regional antagonisms in 
the country are being aggravated. One can already say quite 
definitely that the current higher-ups of the regime do not know 
exactly what to do. The state power is becoming increasingly 
ineffective. Therefore certain little groups in the upper 
echelons are again trying to place their bets on power methods. 
But that will help the regime now in the same way that it did in 
October. 
  In this situation it is no wonder that the declaration 
"Accord in Name of Russia" was proclaimed. I would even say that 
it is not only a movement of left-wing forces but a movement of 
all people of sound mind in our country. 
  After all, all sober-minded people, regardless of their 
political differences, understand that there is trouble in the 
country, and in order to overcome it we need some form of social 
consolidation. The alternative--civil war--will be suicide. We 
are suggesting that we conclude a social contract of all those 
forces for whom the Motherland is an enduring value. We must 
recognize that perhaps the most dangerous threat of the 20th 
century has been hanging over our Motherland. In the face of a 
threatening catastrophe, political antagonisms and differences 
must recede into the background. At least for a certain amount 
of time. In our declaration we have formulated the most 
important and common goals that both the liberal and the 
communist, the entrepreneur and the worker really do have in 
common. 
  [Prokhanov] Last autumn showed that good intentions can be 
counteracted by obtuse rigidity and gross military force. And 
all the perpetrators of the violence in October understood quite 
well that force in and of itself cannot resolve any 
contradiction in society, and this was clearly demonstrated 
after the October events. The crisis was exacerbated. 
  And again scenarios involving all-out violence are being 
worked out in the narrow interests of the present regime, whose 
social base in becoming ever narrower. What prompts your 
intuition? Is it possible to have a repetition of bloody October 
of 1993? 
  [Zorkin] I would say that the October events were the 
culmination of a clash of two tendencies. One of them was 
capable of bringing Russia to peace under the condition that we 
took advantage of the small chance of proceeding step by step to 
build a foundation that would provide for the rule of justice 
and law. Nobody can transgress this law. Any violator--from the 
rank-and-file citizen to the president--would be specifically 
liable for this. 
  Another tendency was working against this chance and, 
although it officially declared the priority of democratic 
values, it was aimed at establishing absolute rule, a 
totalitarian regime. They were preparing a scenario that has 
been played out in Russia's past--both during the past 70 years 
and even before that, when no law, no rights, and no justice 
were taken into account. And arbitrary behavior occupied first 
place in all of this baseness. 
  These two tendencies were stirred up in October, but it is 
now clear that they lay considerably deeper and had been 
manifested repeatedly in the past. Each was defended by people 
who had their own goals. 
  Did the people share these so-called "consumer" goals? Great 
doubts arise here. After all, there is no need to rely on 
violence if the citizens agree with the ruler. 
  The people live in peace with their ruler and the ruler with 
his people when they have a consensus, agreement, a basis of 
legitimacy. This has been the case in various periods of 
Russia's history. Even in that peak situation when Minin and 
Pozharskiy liberated Moscow, national accord was established. 
And when the great Aleksandr II, the Liberator, began the 
peasant reforms. He had prepared a platform. Yes, there were 
those who resisted, there were backlashes, but there were no 
pogroms or big fires or uprisings or civil wars. And Russia 
began a great reform. "Accord in the Name of Russia" is the 
effort of patriots to overcome the catastrophic course of 
development. 
  [Prokhanov] Yes, they were quite special impressions--during 
those days beginning on 21 September...the candle ends on the 
deputies' desks, the barbed wire, the barricades made of pipes, 
the smell of the fabric of soldier's uniforms. The machine gun 
fire and the explosion. What struck you most at that time? 
  [Zorkin] People were unable to believe that such a thing 
could happen. When they started talking in front of this 
terrible barbed wire, when they began to absorb the information 
that the president had resorted to the extreme scenario, the 
members of parliament still could not believe it! Khasbulatov 
could not believe it. I met with him and I can assure you of 
this. The people refused to believe it because all of this was 
beyond the limit. It is one thing to make a political mistake, 
to show a lack of professionalism, but here everything was 
accompanied by such terrible cruelty, immorality, corruption.... 
  This was indeed the apogee of the politics of evil. And, 
moreover, I was shaken by the easy justification of the 
potentates who committed the gangsterism. Because the people 
invested them with this very power, the defenseless people 
trusted them with their souls. And all this was trampled upon.... 
  Before my eyes passed all these gentlemen in a row, court 
politicians asserting that there simply was no other way in 
Russia, the president, speaking against the Constitution, was 
purportedly defending justice...all this left a memorable 
impression: On the one hand, a lack of acceptance of all this 
cynicism and immorality, and on the other--dumb amazement: Why 
is this so, what for? 
  The question arises: How can we motivate those who do not 
even know the concept of repentance to return to the law and 
legal behavior? 
  I do not think that today we are faced with the dilemma of 
"adventurism-democracy" at all. That was the way things stood 
before the October events, when political scientists close to 
the president told him: "You must switch to authoritarianism as 
quickly as possible." Now because of the efforts of these 
"founders" and even practical workers who have armed themselves 
with these theories, we have ended up in a situation that is 
considerably worse, from which it will take a very long time to 
extricate ourselves. 
  [Prokhanov] After our first meeting I asked myself what kind 
of political thinking I had encountered in you. I told myself 
that you were apparently a type of liberal statesman who is 
absolutely rare in Russian political practice. 
  What happened in October was, in my view, a surfacing of 
ancient, morbid political forces linked to the idea of 
totalitarianism. They pushed through again as water does through 
delicate crystals of ice, through that brief, apparently unique, 
liberal period that began with Gorbachev and lasted through 
these two "Yeltsin" years, the period that you frequently embody 
with your way of thinking and ideology. 
  History, after all, passes through individuals and actions. 
And the drama of what happened is not just a drama of the 
destroyed liberal period; it lies elsewhere as well. The Russian 
national tradition was initially oriented toward the Orthodox 
monarchic ideal, a kind of authoritarianism ordained by God. 
This situation was destroyed by the Bolshevist revolution. 
Another situation appeared--a different authoritarianism that 
was linked to the idea of the leader, the elimination of all 
that was mystical and hence justifiably eternal. 
  The liberal approach in which we have all ended up has 
destroyed the red-Bolshevist dominant and crushed all the 
principles by which our nation lived. Now Yeltsin has also 
destroyed the liberal plan. Throughout this century enormous 
violence has constantly been committed against the national 
consciousness. The national archetypes have been turned into 
trash, to dust. Today the public consciousness, in my opinion, 
is not capable of any kind of construction. It is impossible to 
build anything on trash, on powder, on dust. And the drama that 
occurred, in addition to all the legal, social, moral, and 
ethical aspects, has this one as well. 
  [Zorkin] You have touched upon a very important question 
having to do with the character of power. It seems to me that 
above all it should be fair and based on that which from ancient 
times has inhered in Russia, which is called upon to unite 
freedom and legality. The citizens must finally feel that they 
are free people, not slaves to a despot, general secretary, or 
another Boris. But this can be achieved when the primacy of the 
Constitution is established, when the demandingness of authority 
is combined with restrictions which are placed on it by the law, 
that is, the principles of a rule-of-law state are included in 
the system of social values and we accept them. 
  First of all let us agree: Do we need order? Or would we 
live 
under conditions of arbitrariness, lawlessness, mafia rule, and 
corruption?... Yet order cannot be effective unless it is 
accompanied by development and progress. Order and 
development--join these two words together. But this, in turn, 
is possible only with the achievement of stability. Any reforms 
will simply collapse under the conditions of the present chaos 
and arbitrariness. What kind of entrepreneur is prepared to 
anticipate or guarantee anything today if he does not know what 
could happen in the country in a couple of months? That same 
entrepreneur of ours, as sociologists from legal protection 
institutions assert, will "fork over" to bureaucrats 
approximately four times more than the mafia structures will. 
All this is a cancer that is afflicting society. But why is it 
growing? Because we have neither order nor stability. 
  And with all the loud declarations of our intention to fight 
crime, with all the bloody shooting up of parliament, also under 
the guise of striving for order, we are actually being thrust 
into anarchy and chaos. And the authorities are undermining 
themselves because stability in society can be provided only by 
relying on law and legality. And authorities who resort to 
unconstitutional measures for the sake of immediate political 
advantage will become ineffective in the future. Can they really 
introduce order into the country if they themselves are 
professing the principle of grabbing as much as they can and 
taking advantage of force and lawlessness? Such authority dooms 
itself to inevitable failure, and society--to chaos. 
  Let us begin with the extremely important question of 
relations between the center and the regions. We live in a 
federative state--we must take this into account! After all, 
since ancient times the monarch has taken action when the 
territories resisted. But here, conversely, the territories said 
on 18 September: We are in favor of order, in favor of 
stability, Boris Nikolayevich. And on 21 September he began 
these misdeeds and then brushed aside the Soviet of the 
Federation, which for a month before that had been set against 
the Supreme Soviet. 
  What is this? Friends, do I like it when everyone around me 
is trembling and at each other's throats? That is what happened. 
There was squabbling everywhere: the regions with the parliament 
and with one another, and the executive chief with the chiefs of 
the legislative power. Will this not actually lead us away from 
order and stability? 
  Essentially we have had no transformations. Public wealth is 
being plundered under their guise. And instead of systematizing 
and applying everything positive in the world for changing from 
a centralized system to new principles and giving people 
incentive to work, everything is being done to extinguish these 
incentives. 
  First we devalued the investments, thus eliminating 
potential 
small and medium-sized property owners who, on the basis of 
cooperation, could have bought bakeries, small productions, 
shops, etc., and could have created labor joint-stock companies. 
  Then they began to "give away" all the enterprises according 
to the mafia-bureaucrat principle. For instance, in Omsk or some 
other city immense plants are being sold to people at a symbolic 
residual cost. The next day the new owners issue stocks and the 
prices of them are immediately raised to the real market prices. 
A gang of people get fat at state expense this way. And this is 
called transformation? Why did they not take advantage of the 
experience of Spain or America or even our home-grown communal 
principles? 
  If the labor collective itself owns the enterprise and if 
the 
worker is no longer hired but is part owner, he will work quite 
differently. It has turned out this way for us: People's 
psychology regarding work has not changed--we have the same 
nihilism, the same alienation, although we have a different 
owner; the private property owner has taken the place of the 
state. 
  For me the main thing is this: Regardless of what method of 
privatization may be applied, it is necessary for the people to 
become the owners. Otherwise after a certain amount of time we 
will inevitably arrive at a point where things are divided up 
once again. 
  In order for the people to enter this new economy, the 
underprivileged strata must definitely have insurance. Here 
again it is impossible to avoid assigning the state an immense 
social-regulatory role. But our levers and incentives are first 
weakened and then restored again in a new mafia-criminal 
form--they intervene, they redistribute, and they direct.... 
  We must get away from the past, but not to a new disgrace 
but 
to a normal, healthy, regulated economy that benefits the 
workers. I think the owners of capital are interested in this as 
well. They do not want to be protected by barbed wire or 
defended with automatic weapons from the furious crowd. 
  But what has the government done? Instead of taking this 
reasonable path, it has used force to impose its own version of 
shock therapy, and now they are saying that it is not over yet. 
No, it was not carried out fully, but its elements were launched 
in the most primitive and egregiously criminal form. As a 
result, we ended up with a gang of rich people, and instead of a 
middle class the foundations for democracy and rule of law are 
made up of an impoverished crowd. The people have simply been 
deceived! 
  The main point of the transformations is justice. If certain 
people take but they do not give to others and those that have 
even take away more--this is highway robbery. Justice and truth 
are not simply words, they are not simply our age-old Russian 
values. They contain something like what issues from universal 
reason. Because if values are rejected and society is divided 
into thieves and those who are robbed, it will ultimately fall 
apart. 
  I think that this is the main lesson we must draw from the 
October tragedy. And if the ship of immense Russia is to be led 
further along the path of this narrow-minded, egoistic 
understanding of privatization or if it follows instructions 
from the West, we will end up with a country of beggars, a 
desert country. It will become a foreign colony, a region for 
labor therapy. 
  [Prokhanov] We have just experienced the most severe 
structural crisis in which the political machine in the form of 
the Supreme Soviet was broken. Speaking metaphorically, 
destructive energies were introduced into it and it exploded 
from within. Some different kind of mechanism is being created 
now. What is this, this new Constitution? 
  [Zorkin] The process is contradictory. In order to 
understand 
we must turn to the past, to what we have lost. We had the 
rudiments of real transformations and there was the sense that 
step by step we could arrive at democratic transformations, at 
an adjusted course in the economy. 
  But when the people in power got a sense of this, what did 
they start saying? That the Constitution was Brezhnevian and all 
our institutions were obsolete. This was out-and-out deception. 
The Constitution was changed radically in April 1992 and all the 
institutions were adapted to the new conditions. But the 
tendencies that were developing did not favor the absolutism of 
the executive power. 
  The social problems have been aggravated. Mafia and criminal 
elements have developed to such a point that they have actually 
buried the hope of any law and order under the people who are 
now in power. There has been further degradation of the culture 
and the moral condition of society. 
  There has arisen the question of how we can escape from this 
systemic crisis. It was possible on the basis of consensus and 
accord, not some spineless compromise but a real one accepted by 
society in order to escape from a condition verging on civil 
war. Instead of this, they began to use force to impose their 
own position, which actually led to the collapse of the 
state--economic ties were broken and disintegration gripped not 
only the nearby foreign countries but also the Russian regions. 
Transformed into a minority and defending previous catchwords, 
they were simply forced to destroy even the fragile chances of 
democracy and to switch openly to totalitarianism. 
  But what next? To say that there will be another upheaval 
like the one in October--these are all conventionalities. But 
still we can escape this possible bloody future if society 
recognizes that the authorities have deceived and betrayed the 
people and that it is necessary to consolidate in order to 
emerge from the crisis peacefully. But look at what is 
happening. Today the ruling regime is again dressing itself up 
in foreign clothing and raising a foreign flag. During 1990-1992 
they dressed themselves up as democrats even though they had 
nothing in common with them. Now they are dressing in the 
clothing of patriots, centrists, and statesmen, that is, they 
have seized upon ideas that quite recently they called fascist. 
When they understood from the results of the election that the 
people were in favor of these ideas in a healthy, reasonable 
version, they immediately decided to change colors. But what 
about their insides? In general do they understand the essence 
of what is involved with the Motherland and patriotism? 
  In October our society experienced a shock, there was a 
rebellion. As long as the people's soul is alive, it will never 
put up with the situation, it will gather its forces and 
consolidate. And if the regime does not degenerate, it will 
prepare for this national action. These signs are in evidence: 
They are apparent above all in the reorganizations in the power 
structures making them directly subordinate to the president. 
  Of course, the crisis will also develop further. And the 
task 
is for all positive forces that do not want the destruction of 
the society to consolidate. Which forces? All those that are in 
favor of preserving the Motherland--that immense state, not some 
monster, but a state as a living organism. I think that these 
positive forces will include not only the dissatisfied masses 
but, for instance, entrepreneurs as well. For the present 
entrepreneurship under conditions of a thoroughly corrupt mafia 
regime is simply impossible. Only criminal economic activity can 
succeed. 
  All this is objectively leading to a situation where unless 
consolidating forces arise, this regime will fall. But the 
problem is to make sure that all this occurs in a more or less 
civilized framework. All this must not be overcome by crude 
force or universal war. The task is to restore constitutional 
order and stability and to make real transformations with the 
least possible losses. If these positive forces are 
consolidated, we will be able to hope for a successful solution 
to the crisis. But we must not forget that during 3-4 October 
with the firing of weapons against parliament a crude force was 
placed on the political scene, the road was opened up to it. And 
if we do not conduct a maneuver, if we do not restore the 
constitutional system, I do not think we can rule out the 
possibility of military coups. 
  [Prokhanov] This idea of consolidation is at large in 
society. And the question of how to unite power with justice, 
law, and the Constitution, of course, is one of the most crucial 
ones today. If it were possible to have a broad coalition of all 
who are in favor of such immediate strategic goals as 
restoration of constitutional order and transformations on the 
basis of stability and justice, I think it would be possible to 
escape all this hell. 
  [Zorkin] Such a coalition cannot exist today unless it 
becomes a coalition of all the people, a kind of popular 
agreement. There can be various paths to it, but it absolutely 
must be based on all the strata, classes, and 
structures--entrepreneurs and workers and cultural figures and 
the church etc. 
  We are speaking not simply about economic reform but about 
rescuing civilization in that space that is called Russia. 
Therefore this must be not a party but a kind of popular 
congress based on general agreement, above all spiritual. 
Unification into a coalition has a specific purpose--to change 
the regime. Then, after that purpose is accomplished, secondary 
interests will appear, various ones, and pluralism will arise. 
Society must have various interests, they must compete, and 
there must be a certain amount of struggle, for otherwise there 
will be stagnation and a swamp. But it must be carried out 
according to certain rules. 
  A two-party system corresponds to the natural physical 
bipolar model, to symmetry, and the Americans, for example, have 
simply intuitively adapted it to political life. Or we can make 
sure that those who oppose this coalition are transformed into a 
civilized opposition. 
  Yeltsin's problem is that he is striving for autocracy and 
he 
should have provided for an effective two-power system. For is 
it not understandable that from the very beginning it was 
necessary to support the construction of a strong presidency and 
a strong parliament? This was the guarantee of preservation not 
only of the Russian political organism but also the presidency 
as an institution. The gunfire directed at parliament certainly 
did not make the president strong. On the contrary, he became 
extremely vulnerable. Tomorrow force could be used to eliminate 
not only the president but also the institution itself. And the 
where will they look for a legal mechanism to protect them?... 
  What will the general agreement consist of? Unless we are 
aware that, for example, miners cannot receive normal wages 
while the entire organism is sick, nothing that makes sense will 
obtain. The upper echelons are manipulating: Today they give 
something to the miners, tomorrow--to the teachers, next--to the 
newspaper workers. But we need an entirely different system of 
coordinates: A society in which miners and engineers and 
entrepreneurs and teachers will all live well. 
  We must also recognize that Russia is a unified living 
organism. If the regions are concerned only about seizing as 
much sovereignty as possible or finding a special entry into the 
halls of centralized power and gaining credit--this is fatal 
too. This can work from time to time, but then it will fail 
nonetheless. We need a new federalism. 
  In a word, a renewed Russia--this is what the coalition must 
rally around, what we have been discussing, what we have called 
"Accord in the Name of Russia." 
  [Prokhanov] You speak about the possibility of moral and 
political resistance. But for now everything is in the hands of 
the present power: means of suppression, intelligence, 
finances.... 
  At the same time during the past five years of confrontation 
society has been restructured--at the psychological, social, the 
most fundamental level. And to come together and smoke the peace 
pipe once again will require colossal efforts--moral, 
philosophical, perhaps efforts of some group of irreproachable, 
respected people in society who could unite the un-unitable. How 
are we to overcome this social dissension? 
  [Zorkin] Yes, it is difficult to do, but what are we talking 
about? We are giving a diagnosis: If we cross over this last 
threshold we will die. We must arouse in ourselves an ability to 
understand the rational, if you will, an instinct for 
self-preservation. For example, I have no problem engaging in 
dialogue even with people I do not like, who have ended up in 
the other camp. If we agree not to allow the collapse, the death 
of Russia, we must pass over emotions, antipathies, and mistrust 
for the sake of general survival. I hope that the majority of 
people are prepared for this. 
  Of course the coalition must not be merely an abstraction: 
People say, let us create a program and we do not need power. I 
think we have already passed this stage. It must be prepared to 
take responsibility on itself: to adjust the course, to earmark 
a strict transition period, both in the sense of demandingness 
and in the sense of clearly worked-out stages and deadlines. If 
we come to power as Gaydar did--transformations are needed; let 
us give freedom to the market--the same thing will happen, that 
is, nothing specific and tested, and it is better not to take up 
the cause at all. 
  I think the people must respond to conviction, 
professionalism, honesty, and devotion to justice. Because if 
this coalition of intellectuals, pragmatists, and practical 
workers intends to change our present course and do it without 
truth--that is all, they are defeated. The truth is needed so 
that people will believe. And this is precisely where we must 
begin. 
  Here is a team that is suggesting to all of us citizens of 
Russia that we take our destiny into our hands. That we not 
place our hopes in mythical help from abroad, in another 
leader-savior, in the idea that suddenly everything will work 
out of its own accord, but try ourselves to drag the country out 
of this quagmire. We are uniting so that the force that 
strengthened the present power during 3-4 October will not be 
used for general destruction but will be used for something 
else. Against what will the first drive of our struggle be 
directed? Against everything criminal in society. Unless we do 
this, no transformations will help, because criminals in power, 
in the economy or in any other sphere, will always act in a 
criminal way. 
  The question arises: How can we overcome everything that is 
criminal that has become so terribly overgrown in our society? 
We need a very strong, I would say, strict power that is based 
on the law. But the law in this case must be an absolute 
expression of the principle of justice, that is, it must stand 
on the side of the people, statehood, and Russia. 
  Power and the law can be used for good only if they are not 
used to satisfy personal ambitions to provide personal 
well-being. As soon as the struggle begins, the devilish 
elements will be on the watch. When I say that we need truth, 
this means not only to pronounce it. After all, we have seen how 
those who gave the commands on 3-4 October suddenly started 
talking about saving the people, about patriotism, and even 
about accord. 
  [Prokhanov] I recall a theory developed by one noble 
professor, an old man who had been wounded in battle. He divides 
human types into two categories: rulers and harmonizers. They 
are distributed in all spheres of life. 
  The ruler is the person who wields power in the state, the 
family, the design bureau, or production in order to savor it, 
to experience it, to enjoy it, to use it for his own good. The 
result is almost always the same--destruction and 
impoverishment. He exploits the environment and leads it to 
disaster, conflicts, wars, repressions, and ultimately 
degradation. 
  But the harmonizer is a special person of a religious 
disposition. When he ends up on the throne or at the head of a 
family or in a garrison or the environment is entrusted to him, 
he enriches it, brings it to prosperity, even in war he 
preserves and minimizes losses. By nature this is the pastor, 
the tiller of the fields. This is Marcus Aurelius, this is Tsar 
Aleksey Mikhaylovich...these two types have figured very 
frequently in Russian history and they are noted in religious 
and philosophical thought. 
  But now that we have experienced this period of obvious 
rulers for whom power is a goal in itself and its achievement 
can threaten the nation and the state with collapse, 
self-destruction, apparently the time has come for the other 
type of leaders. God forbid that this regime be replaced by 
another one headed by a general with a thick skull and the 
enormous fists of a paratrooper. In fact Russia is waiting for a 
harmonizer. And this does not mean that in the period of 
restoration, which will be severe and demand sacrifices, that 
this new leader will be soft, vapid, and blissful. No, he will 
be very firm, but he must embody that super-task of the 
harmonizer, the savior, the healer. 
  How do you envision the typological features of the future 
leader? What qualities must he have? 
  [Zorkin] It seems to me that he must combine several 
extremely important qualities. First, I agree with you, he must 
not come to power for its own sake. They say that such negative 
qualities can be registered on modern lie detectors. But I think 
the Russian political elite, when it was viable and led the 
country to greater heights, conducted that kind of testing of 
leaders. 
  Just take the election of Mikhail Romanov. There is the 
opinion that he was a weak ruler. But in that stage, when Russia 
was fragmented, dispersed, when every local ruler was laying 
claim to higher power, who was needed? A unifier. He could not 
lay claim to very much, but had to listen to opinions, be able 
to get everyone to sit down at a roundtable, as we say today, 
and say: Let us decide--either we die or this is the first rule 
of behavior, this is the second, this is the third.... 
  Figuratively speaking, it goes like this: Since we are all 
in 
the same boat, let us agree to row in the same direction, nobody 
has the right to stand up, to go wherever he wants to, or hit 
his partner on the head with the chess board because he has put 
him in checkmate. The modern leader must have a sense of what 
unites people, he must comprehend the ultimate task of the time. 
  His second quality is the will and resolve to carry out this 
task. For instance, Andropov. He by nature seemed to be soft, in 
general he reminded one of a professor: He had such a calm look 
in his eye. That is the impression I got of him. And it seems to 
me that when he was in power decisions were made in this same 
intelligent manner. But he had an immense will. 
  Third--a leader must be in tune with the people. People must 
understand that this person has taken on the burden of power not 
out of selfish motivations: He lives and makes decisions in the 
name of some higher goals. 
  Why did Yeltsin come to power? He was perceived as one of 
our 
own. Why was he not perceived like Ryzhkov? I communicate with 
him--I assure you that he is an excellent person. But people did 
not know him well and after he raised the price of bread--quite 
insignificantly by today's standards--his enemies skillfully 
took advantage of this and turned him into an alien who wanted 
to multiply the people's unhappiness. And then there appeared a 
person who said: "People, I know your needs. I know that you are 
not driving Mercedes but Moskviches--I entered the Kremlin in a 
Moskvich. The majority of you ride buses, and I also ride with 
you. I know that you want peace, confidence in the future, and 
no waiting lines." 
  The next extremely important quality is uniqueness. A leader 
without an idea is nothing. Therefore any elite strives to put 
forth a leader with his own image and ideas, or at least they 
create such an appearance for him. All this is because the 
calling of the leader is to take people forward. He must have 
professionalism, he must be able to anticipate and calculate his 
steps. If he has said that by autumn he will achieve such and 
such, he must do it. 
  [Prokhanov] But then there is another quality that has been 
implied in all of your postulates. The leader is in tune not 
only with the times and the nation, but also with what we have 
become accustomed to calling the spheres. He must be fully in 
tune with Providence and understand that he was called at a 
tragic moment for his Motherland as a person who has been 
entrusted by fate to save the country from disaster. This sense 
of purpose, this absolute harmony with the historical and divine 
has made great Russian people real popular leaders. They were 
not simply politicians singled out by the elite, generated by 
civil wars and strife. They were spiritual personalities.... 
  [Zorkin] I do not know whether they felt this themselves but 
they were definitely in tune with the people. The leader and the 
group of people around him virtually led everyone forward so 
that instead of depression there was hope, a general will for 
action. This heroic conduct has always been based on 
spirituality and morality. I am convinced that if base material 
interests rule the person, he is not capable of contributing to 
the development of society. A noble idea moves the leader. In 
this sense I agree: This could be called a sign from the heavens.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee for Issues of Local Self-Government, by Yuriy Kozlov, 
under the rubric "From the Horse's Mouth"; place and date not 
given: "The Devil's Little Ones"] 
  [Text] [Kozlov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich, is it possible to 
consider that a full-fledged system of local self-government has 
evolved and is in operation in Russia at present? 
  [Sliva] This year Russia will celebrate the 130th 
anniversary 
of the movement toward local self-government. In 1864, three 
years after the abolition of serfdom, the Zemstvo Reform was 
implemented, and subsequently the City Reform also began in 
Russia, that is to say, two branches of local self-government 
began to develop. Later came October 1917 and Soviet power. Only 
in 1989 did the train of local self-government, which, shall we 
say, had been shunted onto the "side track," begin to move 
further with friction. We traveled through a few "stations": the 
Union and Russian laws on local self-government, and edicts of 
the president on reform of local self-government which put an 
end to the operation of soviets. At present, local 
self-government in Russia is in a unique situation: In the 
Constitution the rights of the local organs of power have been 
worded and codified at the level of the most exacting world 
standards, whereas legislation in effect, edicts, various 
decisions, and executive acts have come to clearly contradict 
the Constitution. 
  [Kozlov] What are these standards according to the 
Constitution? 
  [Sliva] The power of communities of citizens of urban and 
rural localities is recognized to be natural. Local 
self-government exercises full rights in resolving issues of 
local significance. Ownership, use, and management of municipal 
property by local self-government are guaranteed. Local 
self-government should have its own budget; its right to 
municipal land is also proclaimed. The structure of the organs 
of local self-government is determined by the population itself. 
Residents themselves will resolve whether the mayor, town 
governor, or settlement administrator is to be or not to be. The 
Constitution says: Self-government shall be performed through 
elected organs. Representative organs are at issue, but heads of 
local self-government may also be elected. 
  [Kozlov] In this case, what is the reason for the 
continuously developing conflicts between the executive 
authorities of components of the Federation and urban 
self-government? Let us look, for example, at the scandal in 
Nizhniy Novgorod. Mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod Dmitriy Bednyakov 
stated live on the air that oblast Governor Boris Nemtsov 
intends to find a way to have him removed from his position by 
an edict of the president. 
  [Sliva] The Constitution says clearly that the organs of 
local self-government do not belong to the system of state 
power. They may not belong to the system, but state functions 
are assigned to them through dozens of laws, edicts, and 
executive acts. Conflicts frequently develop over local budgets. 
Continuous redistribution of financial funds is underway. 
Decisions are made at the level of components of the Federation, 
including those on finance, which the local organs are 
instructed to carry out immediately. This is not just 
unconstitutional; this results in social tensions locally. 
  [Kozlov] And what if the local authorities do not intend to 
obey the dictate? 
  [Sliva] There is the tiny town of Shlisselburg in Leningrad 
Oblast. Last Sunday mayoral elections were held there. There 
were six candidates. A worthy candidate, Svetlana Yurkova, who 
got 42 percent of the votes of those turning out for the 
elections, came in first in a most stubborn struggle. The 
nearest competitor trailed her by 20 points. What did the 
electoral commission do the following day? It did not qualify 
Yurkova for the next round! Their motives? They said that on the 
same day she was elected a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of 
Leningrad Oblast. This, allegedly, was incompatible. This 
decision was completely unlawful. Incidentally, in Shlisselburg 
50 percent turned out for the elections, whereas in the oblast 
on the average--29 percent of voters. So, the struggle over 
local self-government is unfolding not only in Nizhniy Novgorod. 
Budgets have been taken away from many cities, including oblast 
seats. The head of an oblast or kray administration 
single-handedly deprives the population of a city of the status 
of local self-government. Local self-government has been 
liquidated in cities dating back 500 to 700 years! The 
Constitutional Court is not in operation; the procuracy organs 
are silent, while "telephone law" continues to apply just as it 
did.... Meanwhile, this should provide grounds for notorious 
court proceedings to resonate throughout Russia! All of this is 
happening notwithstanding the constitutional requirement to 
structure local self-government with historic traditions taken 
into account. Is this supposed to be a new historic tradition? 
Cities are demanding the natural rights that are 
constitutionally codified as theirs. Governors and heads of 
oblast and kray administrations treat the local organs of power 
far more sternly than the center treated components of the 
Federation at one time. There is a paraphrased saying: "The 
devil is not as horrible as his...little ones." Somehow, these 
"little ones," who are ensconced in lofty seats, have suddenly 
forgotten that local self-government is the root system of 
democracy. By restricting local self-government, the "little 
ones" are signing their own death warrant as politicians. If 
there is no local self-government, there will be no real 
democracy; moreover, there will be no real federalism and real 
rights of components of the Federation. Today they turn the 
screw on those who are under them; tomorrow, those who are above 
them will turn the screw on them. I repeat tirelessly that a 
dictatorship--regardless of its specific form--is a social 
system for beggars; self-government is one for affluent people 
owning property, those who are responsible and law-abiding. Only 
with such people may reform be advanced. Failing to understand 
this means failing to understand why reforms are actually being 
carried out in the country. After all, this is not for the sake 
of the personal power of some heads of oblast administrations or 
governors. 
  [Kozlov] As you see it, what is to be done, after all, about 
mayors or, as the edict of the president calls them, "heads of 
local self-governments?" Are they to be elected or appointed 
along the vertical chain of command? 
  [Sliva] The Constitution specifically disallows appointment 
practices. Although it is not fashionable at present, I will 
recall this: The fundamentals of democracy are violated by the 
bid of the center to appoint or confirm local authorities. Lenin 
said this in June 1917 at the First All-Russian Congress of 
Soviets. The correct answer to the simple problem of whether "to 
elect or not to elect the head of the local administration" is 
not to appoint. Incidentally, the Constitution does not allow 
for appointing governors, either. At present, we are at a 
transitional stage: There are both elected and appointed heads. 
In the event a vacancy occurs, the issue should either be 
resolved by way of a direct election or the head should be 
elected by the local representative organ. It is at the very 
least unwise to frustrate elections, to interfere with them, or 
to strive to appoint the person needed at any price. 
  [Kozlov] Does the State Duma Committee for Issues of Local 
Self-Government have an opportunity to influence the situation 
at least somewhat? 
  [Sliva] I believe it does. The president has instructed the 
government, the State-Law Directorate, and his Administration to 
bring all previously issued edicts, decisions of the government, 
and so on into compliance with the Constitution within one 
month. Instructions have been given. Let us hope that they will 
be carried out.

<F P=106> [Statement of the Tatarstan Unity and Progress Party: "The </F>
Socioeconomic Situation in the Republic of Tatarstan"] 
  [Text] Following the signing of the treaty between 
Tatarstan and Russia, the question of reform of the economy is 
moving toward the center of political processes. Considering the 
intensification of the crisis trends in the republic's economy 
(the slump in production, growth of nonpayments, deterioration 
in society's living standard, and so forth), the party, abiding 
by its program, deems it necessary to state the following: 
  For a strengthening of the economic security of the republic 
and a way out of the crisis a new economic policy in practice, 
not in words, is essential. This policy should include the 
following directions: 
  a structural reorganization of industry, including a 
solution 
of the problems of conversion and the development of high 
technology; 
  regulation of prices, pay, and tariffs, primarily in the 
base 
sectors; 
  an adjustment of the privatization program for the defense 
of 
the interests of the population of the republic; 
  an improvement in the banking and financial systems; 
  the formulation of a fiscal and tax policy stimulating 
production and an inflow of capital, with regard to the 
republic's obligations ensuing from the treaty with the Russian 
Federation; 
  reform of the state organs of administration; 
  the formulation of an effective social policy. 
  The party believes that the economic reforms should be 
accompanied by the continued democratization of society, 
including the assurance, in accordance with the Constitution of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, of the rights and responsibility of 
local government. Democratization also demands economic support 
of the press which guarantees its independence in the expression 
of the interests of the civil society.

Progress Party

<F P=106> [Interview with Farida Gaynullina, chairman of the Tatar </F>
Republic Trade Union Council, by M. Ibragimov; place and date 
not given: "Who Needs Trade Unions? The Opinion of Chairman of 
the Tatar Republic Trade Union Council Farida Gaynullina"] 
  [Text] [Ibragimov] The fourth agreement between the Trade 
Union Council of the republic, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the 
Association of State Enterprises of the republic was signed 
recently. Is the current agreement fundamentally different from 
previous ones? 
  [Gaynullina] The range of coverage of problems reflected in 
agreements keeps growing and getting more specific year by year. 
For example, this year the consumer budget became 1,200 rubles 
[R] weightier: We succeeded in incorporating the services of 
baths and laundry facilities in it. A notion such as the price 
of unskilled labor appeared in the law on the minimum wage; this 
makes it possible to set the rate of Category I above the 
minimum wage. It is envisioned to ensure social protection for 
young people, women, and working people in certain sectors (the 
agro-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, the 
sphere financed from the budget), and to reinforce and develop a 
system for amelioration of the law which would bring together 
various regulatory provisions touching on the rights of the 
people. 
  The second reason is found in the area of politics: There 
have been attempts to belittle our role in society. The 
situation is exacerbated by the fact that in the process of 
privatization, some employers try to reduce our rights in the 
collectives to zero. All this prompts us to look for a legal 
avenue of protection. 
  [Ibragimov] Perhaps the law did not have only supporters? 
  [Gaynullina] No intense opponents came along. However, we 
had 
to fight for certain articles. For example, one article was not 
received well; there was a lack of understanding on the part of 
some deputies, associated with registration. Various norms are 
codified with regard to public organizations. According to some 
proposals, registration is not envisioned, whereas according to 
others it is mandatory. Registration of trade unions is 
forbidden according to international norms and legislation in 
effect. 
  There are various versions. We propose to submit copies of 
the charter documentation as a notice. 
  [Ibragimov] Does the new draft law include the right to form 
independent trade unions? 
  [Gaynullina] I think this is behind us. To be sure, there is 
the Yedineniye in Chelny which has about 1,500 members in its 
ranks. However, such a right is included; various principles of 
trade union formation are envisioned. 
  [Ibragimov] As you see it, what are the drawbacks of the new 
law? 
  [Gaynullina] I do not at all think that the law is perfect. 
At present, it is being revised by a Supreme Soviet commission 
for acceptance in the second reading. This will be the law of 
the transition period, and it reflects today's realities. 
  [Ibragimov] Despite all the difficulties, the number of 
nonstate enterprises is increasing. It is common knowledge that 
they do not have trade unions. 
  [Gaynullina] Moreover, giving up trade union membership is, 
unfortunately, one of the conditions for hiring at some 
commercial enterprises. People are deprived of the right to 
protect their interests before the employer. We have already 
encountered such complaints in conjunction with illegal 
dismissals. We had to interfere for purely humane 
considerations. Women end up being deprived of their rights more 
often. There have been cases of work-related accidents, even 
fatalities. A certain amount of arbitrariness is felt. This 
issue was considered specifically at a recent plenum of the 
republic council devoted to occupational safety. 
  Taking advantage of this occasion, I call on the employees 
of 
commercial enterprises to unite--it is easier to protect your 
rights in this way. 
  [Ibragimov] Many people are criticizing the policy of 
privatization pursued in the city and the republic. Thus, 
recently the sociopolitical movement "Economic 
Breakthrough--Third Force" (for now, the only one to do so) 
expressed its opposition to the privatization program by way of 
putting leaflets on the stairways of houses. What is the 
position of trade unions on this issue? As I see it, this is 
something that merits consideration. 
  [Gaynullina] Unfortunately it is impossible to think up an 
ideal version. Procedures for the privatization of housing 
contain elements of social injustice. Some have managed to 
obtain free housing while others have not. At present, the 
social norm comes to 16.2 square meters of housing per capita. 
It would be fairer if an additional fee to benefit those who do 
not have housing were collected when floor space above the 
established norm is privatized. 
  Procedures for the privatization of enterprises on the first 
model also cause some concern; to my mind, they encroach upon 
the economic interests of labor collectives. However, we should 
also be mindful of employees in the sector financed from the 
budget. 
  [Ibragimov] There has been talk in the corridors of power 
about providing compensation payments for employees of 
enterprises who are forced to work short work days or weeks. 
  [Gaynullina] The draft decree is ready. We have familiarized 
ourselves with it and made our proposals. A source of funding 
has also been found: For the most part, compensation to those 
putting in short work weeks will be paid out of the employment 
fund, and partially from the republic budget. 
  We think that the decree will be signed shortly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stewart M. Thompson, chief of the ICL </F>
representative office in Russia and the CIS, by Zhanna 
Khidiyatullina; place and date not given: "ICL Is Together With 
the Government of Tatarstan"] 
  [Text] ICL is the first large Western company that 
has resolved to make a major investment in the economy of 
Tatarstan. It is a computer company with the second largest 
volume of profits in the world. ICL was formed in 1968 by a 
merger of several companies. However, it became truly 
competitive and came to possess state-of-the-art technologies 12 
years ago when a contract was signed with the Japanese company 
Fujitsu, which now owns 80 percent of ICL stock. The company 
employs 24,000 people in 80 countries of the world. ICL consists 
of 26 autonomous divisions or production facilities which 
operate under general leadership on an integrated plan, 
implementing a common strategy. 
  A correspondent of the TATAR-INFORM information agency 
asked Stewart M. Thompson, chief of the ICL representative 
office in Russia and the CIS, to discuss prospects for 
cooperation between ICL and Tatarstan. 
  [Khidiyatullina] When talks began in Tatarstan last year 
about transforming the ICL-KPOVS joint venture into a 
joint-stock company with the participation of the Government of 
Tatarstan, this news surprised many people. Whose initiative was 
it? 
  [Thompson] Our joint venture feels quite confident in Kazan. 
As recently as a year ago we were not planning any radical 
changes. The initiative in organizing the new joint-stock 
company belongs to the government of your republic. However, 
ICL's management showed understanding for the government's 
desire to participate in the profits of an enterprise located in 
Tatarstan. As far as I know, your government already has such 
business experience. 
  [Khidiyatullina] Indeed, the Republic of Tatarstan Cabinet 
of 
Ministers acted a few years ago as cofounder of the first 
Tatarstan-Turkish joint venture, Taturos. However, in that 
instance it made its contribution to statutory capital in the 
form of crude oil. 
  [Thompson] Apparently the same will occur in our case. The 
proportions of investment will change so as to take into account 
the interests of your republic in the distribution of eventual 
profits. You must pardon me for being unable to give precise 
numbers before the meeting of the board, which will most likely 
be held within a few days. Only after this will it be possible 
to schedule the date for signing the principal contract. 
  [Khidiyatullina] It may be surmised that business contacts 
will not be restricted to the framework of the joint-stock 
company.... 
  [Thompson] Of course not. They are much broader than that 
even now. In the fall of this year we will mark the 25th 
anniversary of operations in the market of CIS countries and 
Russia. Much has been accomplished during this time. Our 
computers and banking and retail trade equipment are installed 
not only in Russia. The large oil enterprises of Tatarstan, the 
Administration of Kazan, and the Government of the Republic of 
Tatarstan have been able to duly appreciate the advantages of 
working with our computers and programming. 
  [Khidiyatullina] Why are you convinced of the advantages of 
ICL products? 
  [Thompson] Last year ICL was perhaps the only large computer 
company to make a profit. Of course, it was less than 
expected--only $4 billion, increased sales notwithstanding. This 
is a general problem. Nonetheless, it can be understood that 
close linkage to progressive developments by the specialists of 
the Japanese company Fujitsu made it possible for ICL to not 
only make a spurt in technical development but also to sharply 
reduce production outlays. 
  One does not have to be a specialist to understand that the 
superior quality of the company's products was complemented by 
the ability to reduce prices. Owing to the development of 
so-called "open systems," we help enterprises to ensure 
communications and management of production processes with 
finely developed programs while using the previously purchased 
computers of various companies. In the process, we not only 
deliver, install, and provide training for specialists but also 
stand ready to provide assistance in the continuous upgrading of 
programs. As early as 1985 ICL understood that the development 
of services is the future of computer companies. All our 
advantages are based on the growing volume of services. 
  [Khidiyatullina] It is a pity that despite a respectable 
duration of operations on the market of Russia, the ICL brand is 
not as widely known as the names of not only other large 
companies but also small companies. In Tatarstan, you are 
likewise little known. 
  [Thompson] It is hard to disagree with that. However, ICL is 
now mounting an extensive advertising campaign in your country. 
An invitation to a group of journalists from Russia and 
Tatarstan to visit London has become one of the programs. We 
hope that you will be able to tell your readers in detail about 
the ICL corporation. 
  [Khidiyatullina] Many people believe that for companies such 
as yours Tatarstan is of interest primarily as a cheap labor 
market. 
  [Thompson] Each company is mindful of its profits. Nobody 
will strive for higher costs. For example, it is important to 
select the location for the construction of a production 
facility correctly. However, you must really perceive that, 
according to assessments by the leading economists of the world, 
the territories of North America and Central and Eastern Europe 
will have the decisive role in profit generation. The objective 
of any company, ICL included, is not just to produce but also to 
sell. This is why Russia and Tatarstan are primarily our 
business partners and a market for product sales.

Mukhametshin held a conference yesterday with the participation 
of the chairmen of the standing commissions of the Supreme 
Soviet, Deputy Prime Ministers R. Muratov and F. Khamidullin, 
Minister of Finance D. Nagumanov, Minister of Foreign Economic 
Relations Sh. Arslanov, and the heads of a number of banks and 
departments of the republic.

economic operations. These remarks will be taken into account by 
the government in the process of refining the budget message.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Bakulina under the rubric "Politics. </F>
Words and Deeds": "A Rehearsal of the Southward Charge?"] 
  [Text] Krasnodar-Moscow--It is hard to work with the 
common voter at present. No inducements will lure him into 
politics. Besides, Zhirinovskiy has set Russia on its ears, and 
he still will not quit. 
  However, the Communists of the Kuban would not surrender. 
They have traditionally called on their electorate to be active, 
hoping to keep their position in the region through elections to 
the local legislative assembly. However, there is no way that 
they will outdo the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. 
The people will not be carried along by the mind, the honor, and 
the conscience now. The school of communism is behind us, and 
Zhirinovskiy's PTU [Vocational Technical School] is beginning. 
In the Kuban the PTU is headed by Vladimir Serdyukov, whose 
hallmarks are a quick wit and obedience. So, he appeared to have 
made it to the State Duma on the LDPR ticket, and he would be 
now sitting in Moscow, at the Mir hotel, eating bananas. 
However, following a meeting with the leadership in Moscow he 
did not covet bananas, but surrendered his seat to whoever it 
was due. Well done, fine fellow, everyone should know his place. 
This is the kind of cadres Vladimir Volfovich has! Communists 
and democrats who man different sides of the barricades are 
looking on with envy. However, this is not the only forte of the 
hero of the LDPR. Working in the kray newspaper KUBANSKIY 
KURYER, in the past the only powerful democratic newspaper, he 
adapted it to the needs of the party. The newspaper produces the 
right advertisement, gets the brains of the electorate ready for 
the difficult moment of elections, and...the LDPR headquarters 
has premises, too. However, it is, of course, not Serdyukov 
alone that makes the Kuban of the LDPR tick. Paid emissaries 
annunciate Zhirinovskiy's truth to the cities and villages day 
and night, at times enticing (or perhaps fooling) 40-50 of our 
citizens at one go. By now there is not a rayon seat, not even 
the most inconsequential, in which an LDPR chapter has not been 
created out of its supporters. Are there 50 seats in the 
legislative assembly of the kray? This means that there will be 
50 candidates, one in each district. Serdyukov is confident, he 
has done good work with the branch; besides, there is money. 
Therefore, 20-30 LDPR candidates will definitely make it to the 
assembly. However, Serdyukov is modest and keeps silent about 
the main actual invention, the patent for which is worthy of a 
PTU. How and where did he come up with the candidates for power? 
So, the Zhirinovists (or more precisely, Serdyukovists--knock on 
wood, or it might go to his head) work with the second echelon 
of the now active executive authorities. Young deputy leaders 
with promise who have authority in the collective are the 
objects of their closest attention. 
  A marvelous pie emerges: In some places the Communists have 
made their way to the top of the bill, and the Zhirinovists are 
second. The former think that they are in in earnest and for a 
long time to come once again, and they even put portraits of the 
beloved Ilich back in their old places. The latter yawn 
apathetically--power is almost within their grasp, and suddenly 
look back convulsively to see whether the first ones have not 
joined up with the third ones. 
  Since time immemorial the agro-industrial complex has been 
the third political force in the Kuban. It is very powerful. 
However much Dyakonov, former governor of the kray, tried to 
convert to owner-operated farming and to organize strong peasant 
farms (17,000 peasant farms were created under him in 15 
months), he was "made to go" long ago. This statistic has not 
increased; on the contrary, it is about to slip sharply. The new 
governor Yegorov is convinced that only kolkhozes can feed 
Russia. This is precisely what the agrarians named the block in 
which they united: "Rich Kuban--Rich Russia." The block does not 
intend to engage in doing the old material over. Its membership 
is respectable: In addition to the leading kolkhoz members, the 
corps of directors and the leaders of the largest organizations 
of Krasnodar Kray belong to it. Besides, the task set by the 
powers that be is respectable, too. The supreme echelons of 
power have resolved to flex their muscles and play Russia's card 
by creating the Azov-Black Sea Republic. Given this, one sees 
the name of the bloc as ambiguous. 
  In theory this maneuver should get Mr. Shakhray interested. 
We will set out further into the boundless political expanse of 
the Kuban, this time looking for democrats. Where are they? Will 
we hear their voice from the Kuban? 
  Valeriy Fisyun, chairman of the executive committee of the 
Congress of Democratic Patriotic Forces of the Kuban, informed 
us with a hint of sadness: "Indeed, very little room is left for 
the democrats; the political niche has been virtually filled. 
Finding 50 candidates in order to win the elections to the 
legislative assembly is a very difficult task." 
  What kind of organization is this one that stands ready to 
pick an unequal fight with the local colossi? 
  "The Congress was formed in October of last year. Virtually 
all democratic parties of the region, the Cossacks--the 
so-called White Cossack host of the Kuban, the Cossack 
association of Russia, the farmers--AKKOR [Association of 
Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], and 
various creative arts and scientific unions joined the Congress. 
In the region, most of the parties are small and cannot 
influence the political situation on their own. This is why the 
idea of an association developed, all the more so that an 
election to the Federal Assembly was forthcoming, during which 
we got our first 'baptism by fire.' Along with the Congress, 
which adopted programmatic resolutions On Power, On Grain, On 
Land, and On Privatization, a party was created--the Kuban 
Revival Union. The democrats stated that at present there is no 
democratic power in the Kuban; this means that it should be 
fought for, and it should be explained to the population that 
the democrats were not the ones to bring about decay in the 
Kuban, the perversion of privatization, and other troubles. They 
have never had anything to do with this. The party has got 
itself a newspaper now; its first issue is being prepared for 
publication under the title KRAY KUBANSKIY. Much is being 
concealed from the population. It will wake up once and learn 
that nothing belongs to it anymore, that land, means of 
production, and everything else have owners. We must tell the 
population the truth. Very soon people will learn the documented 
truth. We are preparing, and will soon hold the second congress 
on the topic 'Corruption of Power.' It is a pity that Kazannik 
has quit as prosecutor general." 
  "What would you have told him about?" 
  "We would have told him about the political underpinnings of 
the affair involving the merger of the city of Anapa with 
Anapskiy Rayon and plans for the creation of the resort region 
of Anapa, in keeping with which the liquidation of the city 
executive authorities is planned, as well as the removal from 
his duties of the mayor of Anapa, Korolev, who (in keeping with 
a directive of the government) has for two years been preparing 
documents on granting Anapa the status of a federal city and the 
all-Russian family-type children's resort for recreation for 
parents with children. 
  "We would have told him about a gas terminal which they 
intend to build on the Taman; this may influence the ecological 
situation in the area of Anapa adversely. However, this private, 
joint Russo-American enterprise has close ties to Chernomyrdin's 
son. 
  "We would like to tell many things. We have enough documents 
in which the personal interests of supreme officials in the 
Kuban are traced." 
  As you can see, the democrats have things to say; the 
agrarians have things to dream about; the Communists know how to 
restore order, whereas the Zhirinovists will take power in the 
Kuban by creeping into the legislative assembly without any 
unnecessary noise.

<F P=106> [Marina Kyasova, Tazal Mashukov report on news conference </F>
given by V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria, at Government House in Nalchik on 19 March: 
"V.M. Kokov: 'The Situation Today Is Such that the Struggle for 
Power and Questions of Politics Must Be Relegated to the 
Background, and We Must All Concentrate on Constructive Labor 
and the Economy'"] 
  [Text] The conference was opened and anchored by V. 
Kudayev, leader of the Office of the Press of the President of 
the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. 
  V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, 
began the meeting with journalists with the traditional opening 
remarks. He said, in part: "A political situation is shaping up 
both in Russia and in Kabardino-Balkaria today which differs 
fundamentally from that which prevailed prior to 12 December. 
However anyone might care to characterize the present situation 
from the viewpoint of politics, it is more definite and more 
distinct than prior to 12 December. And the reason for this is 
primarily the Russian people's adoption of the constitution of 
our federative state. The constitution has enshrined 
unequivocally the fact that human rights are the priority in our 
state. It has also unequivocally enshrined the integrity of our 
fatherland, and these are strong aspects of the constitution, 
and this is why we voted for it. But what I would like to 
emphasize is this: The constitution is now a dependable basis of 
the separation of powers. Not of a struggle for power but of the 
legal separation of the various branches of power. Today the 
Russian state represents in terms of form of government a 
republican, presidential state combined with parliamentary 
activity. And it is this particular feature of the situation now 
taking shape that should be recognized by all people who live in 
our fatherland. Each branch of power is called on to concentrate 
exclusively on its own powers determined by the constitution. 
The period when the representative authority adopted and decided 
under its own jurisdiction all questions without exception came 
to an end on 12 December. 
  "And we must recognize this also. It must be recognized by 
both the legislature and the executive. And they must cease the 
wrangling over whose chair is the higher. Proceeding from this 
situation, I say: The period of political blather must end both 
in the Russian state and in Kabardino-Balkaria. 
  "Not questions of politics but questions of the economy are 
moving onto the agenda today. And we shall not for this reason 
get far with slogans: Let us live in unity, let us live in 
friendship, let us live in harmony. For the economy has reached 
the point beyond which lie destitution and a powerful social 
explosion. And the organs of power and administration in 
Kabardino-Balkaria, therefore, should concentrate all their 
thoughts and efforts on the accomplishment of specific economic 
and social tasks. We are for this reason entering into a period 
when we must do everything possible to ensure that all 
enterprises and all forms of ownership work for the good of the 
people of Kabardino-Balkaria. We proceed from the simple 
formula: Let all forms of management and enterprises of all 
forms of ownership develop equally in Kabardino-Balkaria, hence 
let there be many rich people in our republic, but let there be 
no poor people in Kabardino-Balkaria. That is, our policy must 
consist of ensuring freedom of development for enterprises of 
any form of ownership and at the same time of ensuring a strong 
program of social protection of the populace so that we have no 
families or people living in poverty here. 
  "Can the Government of Kabardino-Balkaria cope with this, in 
words, seemingly, simple and comprehensible task. We believe 
that it can. A message of the president to the Parliament of 
Kabardino-Balkaria will be ready in a few days, and if we obtain 
its approval there, a specific government action program in 1994 
will be confirmed on the basis of this document. Today we are 
working intensively on making the present year a year of a 
change in the dynamics of the economy of Kabardino-Balkaria. The 
endless decline we have had in the past five years must be 
stopped in 1994. Industry and agriculture and other sectors must 
in the present year make a turn toward their ascent, toward 
normal conditions and forms of development. 
  "A living standard of society is shaping up in 
Kabardino-Balkaria today that may be regarded as the limit. The 
consumer basket in Kabardino-Balkaria, say, costs approximately 
R60,000, and we have today one-third of the population below 
this R60,000 in terms of income, and this means a great many 
people. We must do everything to ensure that the level of 
personal income at least cover the subsistence minimum, which is 
calculated by various methods, but which is close to reality. We 
will in this connection adopt very serious measures in the very 
near future, on questions connected with the organization of pay 
included. Note that people employed in the nonproduction sphere 
receive more than R90,000, those working in the production 
sphere, only R60,000 approximately. It should, it would seem, be 
the other way about, and those who do not produce material 
benefits should at least be on the same footing as those who 
manufacture commodities. But this is the paradox, the distortion 
in the organization of pay. We intend to implement, as I have 
repeated many times, a strong program of targeted subsidies 
also. We will necessarily arrive at a level of the organization 
of social protection of the populace where all additional 
payments we make to the populace will be brought together in 
single compensation payments, and they will be granted on the 
basis of an application. That is, to those who come and apply to 
the social protection authorities and declare their income, that 
is, in targeted fashion. A situation is now shaping up, 
therefore, in which struggle for power and questions of politics 
must in Kabardino-Balkaria, as, equally, in the Russian 
Federation also, be relegated to the background, and we must all 
concentrate on constructive labor in the name of emergence from 
the profound crisis in which the economy and policy have found 
themselves." 
  After the opening remarks of V.M. Kokov, president of the 
Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, journalists put to him a number 
of questions. 
  Iskhak Guzeyev (of the newspaper ZAMAN): 
  "The state of the economy at present for both Russia and 
Kabardino-Balkaria is, truly, a most important issue. Leaders of 
the republic's social and political organizations are saying 
that they also are concerned by this and are declaring their 
intentions and their desire to assist, contribute, and 
participate in the development of the economy of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria. How do you see their participation here?" 
  [Kokov] I am familiar with this gathering, which calls 
itself 
the Assembly of Political Parties and Movements of the Republic 
of Kabardino-Balkaria. But the assembly's entire tone is not one 
of help for the government but of the emphasis of manifest and 
clearly expressed opposition to it. I reject, therefore, such 
help and such cooperation in categorical form. If specialists of 
the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria have specific proposals, this 
is another matter, and the doors of both the President's Office 
and of the government are open, and we will officially even 
solicit their proposals pertaining to the government's future 
program of activity. In addition, the text of the message of the 
president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria to the 
republic's parliament has today already been distributed to 
approximately 50 percent of senior officials and specialists. 
And it is from the proposals that have been received, with their 
maximum possible consideration, that the message will be 
modified and presented to the Parliament of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria. It is this form that could be a practicable 
mode of the social and political movements' participation in the 
elaboration of the government program for 1994. We are prepared 
to make available to any political movement or party today all 
the material at our disposal. 
  Tazal Mashukov (of the newspaper KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA 
PRAVDA): 
  "There have been especially many letters in the newspaper's 
mail in recent days connected with your edict 'On Certain 
Measures of Rehabilitation of the Balkar People in Connection 
With the 50th Anniversary of Their Repression,' which was read 
out at the mourning assembly on 8 March. It was not published in 
the press, and for this reason everyone is interpreting it each 
in his own way. What is the future of this important document?" 
  [Kokov] I will say that this edict was not born on 8 March 
1994. In all recent years, which have been called restructuring, 
the community of the republic and the authorities have been 
involved in problems of the complete rehabilitation of the 
repressed Balkar people. And not only the Balkar people. 
Representatives of other nationalities suffered measures of 
repression also. 
  A principal demand of the national movements, on the basis 
of 
which they emerged, essentially, was the restoration of the 
rayons. A second point was the formation of a parliament which 
would take account to a greater extent of the interests of the 
peoples populating the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. A third 
desire, absurd, in my view, of a certain negligible part of the 
Balkar people was separation from Kabardino-Balkaria and the 
creation of their own state. Such things were the basis of all 
these movements in recent years. And, if you recall, the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria approved the 
decision of the first congress of the Balkar people in defiance 
of my wishes and my protest. I said at that time literally the 
following: "We have today turned not the best page in the 
history of the relations of the Kabarda and the Balkars." 
  Then that same Supreme Soviet adopted a decision on the need 
for the restoration of the rayons. You remember this also. 
  But on 8 March 1994 I signed an edict with regard to the 
developing political situation. Some people believe that I 
exceeded my authority. I, however, believe that I did not exceed 
my authority by writing: "to rename Sovetskiy, Cherekskiy 
Rayon." I would like to ask normal people: How is this bad for 
anyone, to whatever nationality he may belong? 
  Another point. There is written there: "To consider it 
essential to restore Elbrusskiy Rayon, incorporating the village 
of Kendelen with the consent of its inhabitants." I ask you: 
Whom does this formula not satisfy, what is unreasonable about 
this? 
  Or another point--the formation of a commission and the 
submittal to parliament of a proposal concerning the 
territorial-administrative arrangement of Kabardino-Balkaria. 
What is unreasonable or incomprehensible here? I would like to 
say that the meeting hall, the thousand people present at the 
assembly, accepted the edict with complete understanding and 
approval. And I consider this a normal step in satisfaction of 
the moral damage which was caused the Balkar people. 
  If the head of the Russian state finds it possible at this 
time to make profuse apology on behalf of the Russian state to 
the Balkar people, why can the head of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria, accommodating long-standing desires, not 
rename one rayon and not form another rayon following 
consultation with the people who will be called upon to live in 
this rayon? This today is merely a subject of speculation, and 
it would seem time to stop this. This step is aimed at adjusting 
the protracted, if not opposition, then at least strained 
situation in the relations of the peoples inhabiting our 
republic. I, as a citizen of Kabardino-Balkaria, not as an 
official, am absolutely sick and tired of the period of 
fruitless opposition. And I believe that each day of such 
opposition works against each Kabarda, each Balkar, each 
Cossack, and each individual residing on the territory of our 
republic. Aspirations to have done with the opposition and to 
secure peace and harmony in the republic were the motivation for 
this edict. And I will insist before parliament that it approve 
this edict, schedule a referendum in the village of Kendelen, 
and form a commission to consider other questions of the 
administrative-territorial arrangement of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria. And not only of the Balkar rayons. Of both 
the Cossack and Kabardin rayons also, perhaps, if this is 
economically expedient and corresponds to the present times. 
  This is my attitude toward this edict. And its future is 
this: We will uphold and defend it in parliament, and I hope for 
the good sense of our corps of deputies and that they will 
support the edict and I am absolutely convinced that this 
document will serve as a good foundation for stable work in the 
future. 
  As far as other parts of the edict are concerned, such a 
part 
as, for example, the instruction to the Constitutional 
Commission to work on the formation of two chambers, in one of 
which all the peoples of the republic are represented, I have 
never seen nor do I now see anything wrong here. If we want to 
live in peace and harmony. After all, we are all maintaining 
that we are today for a united Kabardino-Balkaria. Then please 
explain to me, a Kabarda, what is threatening about the fact 
that there will in one chamber be, say, 11 Balkar deputies, 11 
Russians, and 11 Kabarda? What is the threat to me? There is no 
threat, especially since we live in the Russian Federation, 
whose constitution has clearly determined that all changes of 
the borders of components of the Federation are possible only by 
mutual consent, that is, a power solution of territorial 
questions is 100 percent excluded. And whoever summons us to 
this, to power solutions, is a criminal, a criminal before the 
constitution, and we will deal with him with the full severity 
of the laws of the Russian Federation. 
  Marina Kardanova (of the newspaper SOVETSKAYA MOLODEZH): 
  "Last Saturday the NSBN [National Council of the Balkar 
People] adopted a resolution demanding the restoration of all 
the Balkar rayons and a solution of the bicameral parliament 
question. It stipulates that unless these questions have been 
settled by our government and president within a month's time, 
the NSBN will go to the leadership of the Russian Federation and 
the Federation Council with a request for consideration of the 
question of the creation of a Republic of Balkaria within the 
Russian Federation. 
  "How do the government and the president of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria intend to react to this and what is the 
possible response of the Federation Council to this request? 
  "And the second question. At what stage is our relationship 
with the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation in 
respect to the payments of the promised compensation to the 
persons who suffered from political repression?" 
  [Kokov] To speak of questions of territorial rehabilitation 
of the Balkar people, in Kabardino-Balkaria it has progressed 
the best compared with any other repressed people. This is my 
assessment. Some may agree with this, some may disagree. But 
judge for yourselves. I will give you some approximate figures. 
Thirty-five thousand persons of Balkar nationality were forcibly 
deported. Today the Balkar population constitutes, in the 
Russian Federation at least, 90,000. Thirty-five thousand are at 
the present time living in the ravines, and these ravines could 
not physically sustain a larger population. Everything is 
distributed there down to the last scraps. Putting up an extra 
house there is a problem. Where does the rest of the population 
live? On different territory, most likely. And whoever is 
campaigning for the separation of Balkaria is pushing his people 
onto a disastrous path because the day this happens, a large 
part of the population would be "squeezed" into the ravines. And 
would be "squeezed" by various methods. Power methods, 
necessarily. This would mean blood and a tragedy for the people. 
So it is that all these years I have been trying to show that 
the people that experienced such a tragedy in their history 
should not once again take a path that would lead to blood and 
to senseless loss of human life. This is the elementary content 
of all our efforts geared to ensuring that the republic be 
united. We are today so integrated that no one could disunite 
us. And this is, therefore, an absurd preoccupation. 
  As far as the response to the decision of the NSBN is 
concerned, this is an organization that is not even registered 
as yet, I believe. Yet it was formed to create the Republic of 
Balkaria, and the Constitution of Russia permits this only with 
general consent. There has been no consent, that is, the subject 
of the creation of this organization is played out. I am not, 
therefore, thinking of any special response to any such 
statements. I have already responded to these statements. And if 
some people have nothing to do and want to take this matter 
further, let them do so. But the prudent part of the Balkar 
people reacted to this at the time of the ballot in the 
elections for the Federation Council with unanimous support for 
the candidacies of both the president and the prime minister for 
the Federation Council. Not of Kokov, not of Cherkesov, but of 
the president and the prime minister and their program. And our 
program is unequivocal--the republic must live eternally, as 
thus far, as a united family and must tackle the urgent tasks 
that confront its inhabitants. There will, therefore, be no 
reaction on the part of the government. 
  As far as the Federation Council is concerned, it will not, 
I 
assure you, respond to the territorial division of Russia. I do 
not recognize any divisions or any movements that could lead to 
a confrontation and to innocent victims and I will put a stop to 
them with all the powers at my disposal. In short, the 
Federation Council will, I am sure, not respond to such 
requests. Because the corps of deputies there now is 
sufficiently serious and balanced. 
  Concerning the second question. If you noticed, the edict of 
the president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which is 
being criticized once again by certain figures of various 
movements, contains the following point--rendering persons of 
Balkar nationality who suffered repression in the period 
1944-1957 lump-sum material support. Why did we write this in? 
Because the question of the payment of sums of compensation to 
all persons in the Russian Federation who suffered repression is 
today economically onerous, and a consummate unified procedure 
in Russia has not been worked out. Some people say: Pay on a 
family basis, others, on an individual basis. Some say: The 
minimum salary times 100, others, 40. This question is at the 
discussion and modification stage. But we are participating 
actively, and the question of compensation payments for people 
who suffered repression will, most likely, on the whole, in the 
very near future be settled on the scale of the Russian 
Federation. But lest we plunge it into a common precedent of 
such a kind, we sought to ensure that the edict of the president 
record a clause not on compensation payments but on material 
support for persons of the Balkar nationality who suffered 
repression. And it is this question that we will have settled in 
the very near future. In addition, we already have R1 billion 
here, which many people are mentioning frequently. We will start 
payments from this R1 billion to the most elderly people. 
According to our, Kabardino-Balkar, procedure, if it is not a 
part of the Russian procedure, we will adjust it. But holding on 
to this money any longer without doing anything with it would be 
simply criminal. The money must work either for man or for the 
republic. And we will begin these payments to persons who 
suffered repression in 1944. 
  Miloslav Bityukov (of the newspaper YUG): 
  "Your message to parliament. When will it be delivered? What 
is its main idea? Is it a political or economic document?" 
  [Kokov] The main idea of my message will consist of the 
righting of the economy of the republic in 1994 and making the 
latter a year of change. But jettisoning policy from the message 
absolutely would be wrong. And I would describe my document as 
political and economic. But I am sure of one thing--it will 
determine the main directions of our activity and will be a 
sound basis for a specific program, bolstered by figures, of 
government activity. All this is to take place in April, within 
the framework of the present sitting. I will have it in finished 
form next week, probably. I want to get more opinions and have 
more support for the message in advance in order that the debate 
in parliament might be more productive. This is my mission. 
  [Bityukov] Could you in this connection familiarize us at 
least with the heads of the message? 
  [Kokov] I promise that the leading newspapers will receive 
it 
and that they will have an opportunity to discuss it. And I 
would be sincerely grateful for any criticisms and suggestions 
you express. We all ultimately have a single goal--the 
well-being of our republic. Who conceives of the achievement of 
this well-being in what way is another matter. This could be 
disputed also, but if we were to adopt a program of activity in 
1994 which is consummate and which has been approved by the vast 
majority of the people of Kabardino-Balkaria, its successful 
realization would be predetermined. 
  Oleg Guseynov (of the newspaper SEVERNYY KAVKAZ): 
  "What is your attitude toward the proposal of Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov, president of Kalmykia, concerning the abolition of 
his constitution and the recognition in Kalmykia only of the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation, which, incidentally, was 
supported by NSBN Chairman S. Beppayev?" 
  [Kokov] I take a negative view of this. The richness of our 
fatherland consists of the fact that more than 150 peoples and 
nationalities live here. This multilingualism, this diversity, 
is the might of the Russian fatherland. But at the same time we 
have all been speaking for several years now about our 
sovereignty, about the right to self-determination. This is why, 
participating in the constitutional process and the work of the 
final commission, I sought to ensure that the Federal Treaty be 
an official appendix to the present constitution (even if it 
might to some people appear formal). And, thank God, 2 million 
copies of the constitution, to which the Federal Treaty is 
officially appended, have been published. In addition, this 
problem was once again discussed at my last meeting with the 
president of the Russian Federation, and the following agreement 
was reached--constitutionally structured or formally structured, 
the Council of Heads of the Republics will function. If only so 
that the president of Russia and the leaders of the republics 
might exchange opinions on various matters. 
  Second, we agreed that Kabardino-Balkaria and the Russian 
state would conclude an official treaty. And literally yesterday 
we discussed who would take part on the side of the Russian 
state, and who, on the side of Kabardino-Balkaria. And the task 
is to ensure that the treaty satisfy our requirements and at the 
same time strengthen the Russian state also. The proposition of 
the president of Russia on this matter is that he and the center 
do not need one gram of the authority which could be realized 
locally, in the regions and components. He needs merely the 
authority that guarantees and ensures the integrity of the 
Russian state and its security. Therefore, the president of the 
Russian Federation suggests, work out a treaty that satisfies 
you in full, and we will sign it. 
  And this, in my view, is the correct solution of the 
questions of relations with Russia. We will move along the path 
of full federalism, along the path of the formation of a truly 
federative state. And what is wrong with this? Abolishing the 
constitution of a republic, in which there are particular 
features characterizing this people or the other, for that 
matter, and the wishes of this people or the other would be at 
least abnormal, therefore. I am absolutely sure that national 
distinctions persist today and I consider it premature, 
therefore, to rush to abolish one's constitution. And it is 
Kalmykia's business according to which constitution it should 
live, according to the Russian Constitution or some other.... 
  We are thinking of devising a constitution in the course of 
this year and, as I said earlier, adopting it. A constitution 
that accommodates in full the interests of all the peoples of 
Kabardino-Balkaria. 
  Tatyana Mochalova (of the Kabardino-Balkaria Television and 
Radio Company): 
  "You have said that this year will be pivotal in an economic 
sense. What ways out of the economic crisis do you see if it is 
considered that ours is a subsidized republic and that the 
financial position of the industrial enterprises continues to 
deteriorate? 
  "And, second, if the conflict at the Tyrnyauz 
Tungsten-Molybdenum Works has been resolved, how?" 
  [Kokov] The government and also a parliamentary commission 
and many specialists of the republic are today working on 
specific ways out of the crisis. But the main thing I have to 
say is this: The spring-field operations will begin in literally 
a few days' time, and it is important that agriculture in 1994 
work at full stretch. The wavering is over. We held a meeting of 
activists of the agro-industrial complex and determined our 
positions in respect to the main directions of our activity in 
this sphere. Not one square meter of land in Kabardino-Balkaria 
must be left uncultivated. Not one normal, fit Kabardino-Balkar 
inhabitant will be left in 1994 without something to do in 
agricultural production. 
  We intend to cater in full for the requirements in respect 
to 
truck gardens of everyone who desires this. We also intend to 
satisfy all applications in rural localities for adjoining 
personal plots of land before 15 April of this year. Do the 
financial possibilities for this exist? I believe that we have 
such possibilities, and our contacts with the federal government 
afford me reason today to give the firm assurance that we will 
cover agriculture's needs for financial resources, however 
pessimistic some people might be. Specifically, since the start 
of the year we have channeled R17 billion into agriculture. In 
addition, there are documents in the Ministries of Finance, 
Economics, and Agriculture of the Russian Federation, which have 
been coordinated with higher authorities, for a sum total of 
over R70 billion. Even if we do not manage to materialize 
everything, these funds are sufficient for ensuring that the 
agro-industrial complex operate to the full extent. 
  Another point. We in the Russian Federation have settled 
questions connected with the development of a resort and tourism 
in Kabardino-Balkaria. There is a special decree, which we will 
obtain shortly, which determines the main paths of the 
development of these traditional sectors of our republic. 
  The next direction. We have designated quite distinctly a 
program of hydropower construction in Kabardino-Balkaria. 
Whether there will be R38 billion, whether there will be R30 
billion, it is a fact that this work in the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria will proceed apace, that is, this will be a 
sizable chunk in capital construction. We have designated 
perfectly distinctly the extent of highway construction. 
  A large amount of work is scheduled in housing construction. 
And we will first and foremost display special concern for the 
needy, large families, the handicapped, and those who have been 
on the waiting list for many years. We will build for families 
of the inhabitants of hostels and barracks in the city of 
Nalchik approximately 1,400 apartments altogether. We will make 
a start on houses whose foundations have not been laid and will 
continue those whose foundations have been laid. 
  The main problem for us is to secure the stability of the 
operation of the enterprises. It is this that we are all now 
working on: the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, 
and individual directors of large enterprises. We will join the 
conversion program and will obtain some amount of money. But 
even if I am unable to get anything resolved within the 
framework of federal conversion programs, we have a backup move 
even here--we will have preferential credit for the industrial 
enterprises amounting to no less than R50 billion. I intend 
discussing this problem with the president of Russia in the next 
few days, incidentally, if possible. If not, it will be settled, 
most likely, 4-5 April, when the next sitting of the Federation 
Council takes place. But the most important thing is the 
intrinsic potential, which we have and are using far from fully. 
Many directors are, if you will excuse the expression, 
unfortunately, "totally ensconced" in office, not just present. 
And are giving no thought to the future and are not concerned 
for the fate of their work force. Today's criterion for the 
evaluation of any director: If the outfit is working, has steady 
wages, and makes the compulsory payments, thanks are due him. No 
one requires of him either plans or a product list and so forth. 
But if a person fails to cope with this task, does he have any 
right to be a director? Undoubtedly not. And for this reason 
many people are accusing us of saying that the skilled 
operatives should not be broken up. They should be. Operatives 
who have not blended in in five years will not do so in five 
months. This is futile. We must make personnel changes and 
entrust the work to those who are capable of operating under 
market conditions. 
  Further, we must find a way out of the situation that has 
taken shape in respect to banking in Kabardino-Balkaria. Either 
we--the republic--have the right to dispose of our own financial 
resources or we will demolish the state by default. This is what 
I am talking about. Either an enterprise or myself are in debt 
to someone or someone is in debt to me, in either case, who is 
the winner? Only the bank. The multimillion-dollar fortunes of 
the present bankers and their institutions are being racked up 
on the nonpayments alone. Many enterprise leaders are 
"stripping" their work force through this loophole alone. So it 
is that I say that all state resources in Kabardino-Balkaria 
should be in the hands of the state bank. If the National Bank 
cannot handle this, we will establish a Bank of Reconstruction 
and Development, which would be entirely responsible for state 
funds. But all the billions we solicit and take from our 
populace amass interest via these banks in three or four months 
of mutual nonpayments, and the interest is pocketed. That is, we 
will adjust this matter also. We will also tackle questions of 
taxes, streamline and support some, stimulate others, and take 
from whoever today has possibilities. 
  Now as far as the Tyrnyauz Works is concerned. We have long 
been involved in a persevering study of this works. Only 
understand that the works--the city--is a single whole. And we 
have already "hung" the entire infrastructure of the city on 
ourselves and have been financing it for more than a year. Is 
this not assistance to the works, which earlier supported this 
entire city? 
  Another point. We obtained for them privileges in the 
electricity tariff, and the electricity tariff with them 
constitutes more than half of their prime costs. We are 
currently preparing a directive of the prime minister of the 
Russian Federation especially on the Tyrnyauz Works. And of the 
R700 million we had in reserve for the purchase of meat on the 
special quota, that is, for kindergartens, hospitals, and so 
forth, we recently gave them R600 million directly, I believe, 
so that they might square accounts down to a single kopek in 
respect to the miners' pay. 
  And for this reason a conflict, whoever wanted to fan one in 
Tyrnyauz, did not eventuate. It was not, strictly speaking, the 
work force that assembled there but a small part of it, those 
who would like to have a separate state. There was for this 
reason no conflict there. We warned the management: If some 
people other than you can assemble your work force, they, the 
other people, should be the directors of this works, not you. 
This most likely had an effect. At least, they asked of us: 
Don't come here, we will sort it out ourselves. And they did so 
and reported that no decisions were adopted there. 
  It is a fact that the miners are today in a difficult 
position, and may the entire population of Kabardino-Balkaria 
understand us if sometimes we make another gesture and take 
another step in support of them. Their working conditions are 
difficult, and we will do everything within our power to ensure 
that the Tyrnyauz Works function normally as a state enterprise. 
  Igor Terekhov (of INTERFAX): 
  "The structure of the Government of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria was formerly brought into line with the 
structure of the Government of the Russian Federation. There 
have now been changes in it. Will there be similar changes in 
your government? If so, of what kind? What is your attitude 
toward the proposal of V. Ardzinba, chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of Abkhazia, concerning the integration of the economy of 
the Republic of Abkhazia in the economy of the North Caucasus 
region?" 
  [Kokov] The structure of the government is not something 
frozen and given once for all. It should change. And the 
Government of Kabardino-Balkaria should now be changed both in 
terms of structure and in terms of numbers. If I am successful 
in all that I have in mind, and I am working on the papers, 
calculations, and feasibility at this time, the Government of 
the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria and the entire system of the 
executive in general will in terms of numbers shrink by a 
minimum of 20 percent, optimally, 30 percent. Thirty percent is 
what I would like. I would not argue about anything over 20. 
This as regards the numbers. 
  As far as the structure is concerned, we have 31 members of 
the government. This is the case, I believe. Estonia, a state, 
has 13 members of the government. But even if we are conditioned 
by Russian canons, 30 structural subdivisions is a lot, all the 
same. There are offices that could perfectly well be part of a 
single complex. And for this reason the number of ministries and 
departments, if I am successful, having convinced people and not 
having evoked serious opposition, in reducing them to 21-23 (I 
have both versions), I would consider my goal to have been 
achieved. But the system of the executive must under all 
conditions be competent, highly efficient, and operational. 
  The executive should, I am convinced, encompass all 
components of the state, from the smallest homestead and 
settlement through the republic. And in this respect I am in 
confrontation, in disagreement, with the provision of the 
constitution which says that local government is separated from 
the state. I do not understand such a state, a Russian state, at 
least, in which people may at the bottom do what they want and 
at the top squabble endlessly. We should not have this. The 
smallest community should have, therefore, an authorized 
representative of the executive. Whether he is elected or 
appointed is another matter. This may be argued, but there 
should be such a person. I am for such a format and for such 
changes. 
  Concerning the second question. I have the proposal from 
Abkhazia. I have the telegram. But when we discussed it, we 
framed the question this way: Would this not be interference in 
the affairs of another state? Would we not hereby be pushing 
Ardzinba himself and his parliament into a new confrontation? 
And it was for this reason simultaneously my suggestion that 
this meeting be held in Nalchik. These same thoughts had in 
parallel, apparently, taken possession also of the Krasnodar 
leadership, which also announced its desire for these meeting to 
take place in Krasnodar. 
  I believe that questions of Abkhazia's integration in the 
economy of the North Caucasus are absolutely realistic and do 
not conflict with any international laws. And we should do 
everything possible to ensure that this integration take place 
at a durable level. 
  As far as political problems are concerned, they should be 
discussed at a meeting of leaders of the North Caucasus and 
Abkhazia. These matters were the subject of a brief examination, 
incidentally, at the present sitting of the Federation Council, 
from which I have just returned. I noted in a brief speech that 
the techniques of the conclusion of Russia's treaty with Georgia 
contained a statement of the president of the Russian Federation 
prior to its signing to the effect that the treaty would take 
effect only after the all-embracing Abkhaz-Georgian question had 
been regulated. 
  And the treaty, which has now been concluded, records in one 
article that it will take effect, like any other treaty, only 
after ratification. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation will not be submitting this treaty for 
ratification even within the first six months, consequently, the 
agreements we reached at that time will hold up. As far as other 
problems are concerned, they should be resolved only 
politically. I repeat: Now is not the time when territorial 
issues can be decided by force. 
  Zufar Kambiyev (of the newspaper ADYGE PSALE): 
  "Elections to local government authorities are being held in 
many regions of Russia at this time. When is it planned to hold 
such elections here?" 
  [Kokov] If you recall the edict on elections to the 
parliament of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria and the changes 
we made to our constitution, it follows from these documents 
that we must form a durable constitutional commission to draw up 
a constitution in the course of the first six months, and then 
we would discuss it and adopt it before the end of November. I, 
for example, do not consider it necessary to once again plunge 
the population of the republic into some elections before the 
constitution is adopted. Consequently, we need to work 
intensively on the elaboration of the constitution and its 
adoption. And to hold elections to the local authorities with 
regard to the provisions of the new constitution. But there is 
another opinion also: Let us adopt a law on local government as 
soon as possible and hold elections in accordance with it. We 
will discuss these problems. But I would consider it possible to 
hold elections to the local authorities only in accordance with 
a new constitution, consequently, some time around 
October-November. There are boards under the auspices of the 
administration chiefs, and I believe that the administration 
chiefs could work without major errors and provide for control 
of both the economy and other social processes until then. 
  Marina Kyasova (of the newspaper KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA 
PRAVDA): 
  "A memorandum on civil peace and harmony is being made ready 
for signing at the Russian level. Could you, as a participant in 
the meeting in the Kremlin at which this matter was discussed, 
not express your attitude toward it? 
  "Should a similar memorandum be drawn up in our republic?" 
  [Kokov] I was invited to this consultative conference under 
the aegis of the president of the Russian Federation. Of all the 
republics, only Kabardino-Balkaria participated. I supported the 
idea of the memorandum and said there that any step in a 
direction providing for political stability should be supported. 
But in doing so I said also that we should not put our hopes in 
this document. There have been many agreements of all kinds, but 
they are not producing tangible results. I say: Let us live 
according to the constitution, and no memoranda will be 
necessary. Give us, consequently, a package of laws and a 
mechanism making it possible to realize all articles of the 
constitution that has been adopted. 
  Were we to live and work according to the constitution, no 
memoranda would be needed. Such a memorandum would do no harm in 
the Russian state. It could do some good even. At least, those 
who are in charge of political parties and movements would, 
having signed this document, be compelled to abide by it, of 
course. And another point: Those who occupied extreme positions 
and who refused to sign it would be showing the whole people 
their true colors, that is, their reluctance to live in peace. 
This is important also. I support the memorandum, therefore. 
  I do not consider it necessary to prepare a similar 
memorandum in Kabardino-Balkaria. Why? Because there are 
legitimately elected authorities and there is the constitution. 
And all parties and movements, whoever is in charge of them, 
should live within this framework. We, the authorities, are 
called on to ensure the functioning of all movements only within 
the framework of the constitution. [end Kokov] 
  In conclusion V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria, appealed to the journalists as follows: "I 
have repeated this many times and repeat it now also--peace and 
harmony in the republic depend to a decisive extent on what you 
have to say. Let us bethink ourselves. Let us not bring to the 
people, the masses, information that agitates the public mind. 
Let us not support those who are endlessly pushing us toward the 
abyss. We do not need this. I repeat: Neither the president nor 
the parliament are forever. They are today allotted by the 
constitution a particular length of time. Let us in the name of 
the peace and prosperity of the republic support the activity of 
the legitimate authorities. The time will come when we will 
elect others. Prepare for new elections, consequently. This is 
prudent, this is normal. And, strictly speaking, should we some 
day live in a state based on the rule of law!? Yes. And we need, 
therefore, to expunge from our consciousness completely the 
possibility of the use of force to achieve our political ends. 
It is on this that I would ask you to target and concentrate 
your efforts."

<F P=106> [Release by the press service of the Parliament of the </F>
Kabardino-Balkar Republic: "Equal Development Opportunities for 
the Three State Languages. From the Proceedings of the Soviet of 
the Republic--Parliament of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic"] 
  [Text] After discussing very quickly the proposals 
concerning Temporary Regulations of the Chambers of the KBR 
[Kabardino-Balkar Republic] parliament, on which Kh. Shogenov, 
deputy chairman of the Commission for Legislation, Legal Order, 
Security, and Human Rights, made a report, the deputies moved on 
to the draft KBR Law "On Education." It was presented by V. 
Tlupov, chairman of the Social Policy Commission. 
  Let us note that an extensive draft was prepared by the 
relevant commission of the Supreme Soviet in its time, but was 
never passed. 
  According to the draft, the sphere of education is 
proclaimed 
to be a priority. A republic program for the development of 
education which would be prepared and revised on a competitive 
basis would be the foundation of the state policy of the KBR in 
the area of education. All citizens of the KBR would be 
guaranteed free general education and, on a competitive basis, 
free vocational education. Conditions would be provided for 
developmentally impaired children to receive education; those of 
outstanding ability will be assisted in receiving an elite 
education. 
  Having passed through the first section without much 
disagreement, the deputies dwelt for a long time on the second 
section devoted to education and national culture. Despite 
clarifications from Z. Nakhushev, the speaker of the chamber, to 
the effect that the law was being developed for the long term 
(this is also stated in Point 3, Article 6 of the first section: 
"State educational standards for new educational programs shall 
be introduced, as a rule, five years after the beginning of work 
under the programs in question"), members of the Social Policy 
Commission who introduced the draft had to answer many questions 
and stoically defend a number of its provisions and articles. 
  Citizens of the KBR are entitled to receive primary general 
education in their native languages, as well as to select the 
language of instruction within the framework of opportunities 
provided by the educational system (Point 2, Article 7). In this 
case, queried V. Protasov, why adopt Point 6 of the same 
article: "The language of one of the indigenous peoples (either 
Kabardin or Balkar), at the option of the student, as one of the 
state languages of the KBR shall be introduced as a required 
course in all educational establishments (general-educational, 
secondary) in which instruction is offered in the Russian 
language." It was explained to him that the language of 
instruction and the subject of study are different things, and 
that the three languages proclaimed to be the state languages of 
the republic should have equal opportunity for development. 
  Differences over the language policy were quite substantial 
and led to many hours of discussion which, however, proceeded 
quite properly, in parliamentary form and expression. There was 
no dearth of arguments from both sides, with each side trying to 
convince the other that its particular arguments were weighty. 
The polemics were protracted, and the words of KBR Deputy 
Minister of Public Education V.V. Shibeleva, who attended the 
proceedings, sounded, in a way, surprisingly conciliatory: "The 
problem is indeed great, but the children have no doubts. They 
have this subject (Kabardin or Balkar) on their curriculum, and 
they study it in peace. Everything will be normal--given that 
the approach is professional and the methodology is competently 
developed. Nobody will be harmed by knowing another language." 
  They settled on this, although repeated disputes arose 
later. 
Thus, having read in Point 2, Article 8: "...Any politicization 
of the history of KBR nations shall not be allowed," the members 
of parliament began to have doubts: Is this possible? After all, 
history in itself is politics. Nonetheless, they resolved that 
they should strive for lay, unpoliticized education. 
  In two days the deputies covered only two sections out of 
seven. Well, the draft law "On Education" is one that applies to 
all without exception. In essence, the kind of society we will 
create directly depends on this draft law. Therefore, such 
painstaking work should be justified.

<F P=106> [Interview with N.A. Klimenko, chief of the Main Branch of </F>
the Russian Federation Central Bank for Kabardino-Balkaria, by 
R. Kronik; place and date not given: "Nikolay Klimenko: The Laws 
of Banks Are the Rules of the Road for Money"] 
  [Text] This phrase in a conversation with Nikolay 
Alekseyevich Klimenko, chief of the Main Branch of the Russian 
Federation Central Bank for Kabardino-Balkaria, struck me in 
particular, perhaps because it presented money as something that 
is both alive and significant rather than as generic inanimate 
capital. 
  Klimenko confirmed: "To me, this is indeed so. I have been 
working in finance organizations for 33 years. I was assigned to 
a job here upon graduating from the Saratov Economic Institute. 
I started out in the position of credit inspector at the Terskiy 
Rayon Branch of the bank, gradually climbed up all the rungs of 
the official ladder, and have been heading the republic branch 
since 1984. 
  [Kronik] Has the work ever seemed dull to you? It is very 
specific, after all. 
  [Klimenko] It never has. As it is, you can take different 
views of any job. I was always attracted by personal work with 
clients, even at the time of rigid restrictions imposed by all 
kinds of instructions, and it is even more attractive at present. 
  [Kronik] You may find this offensive, but until recently we 
only recalled the existence of the bank twice a month, 
associating purely run-of-the-mill situations with it: "The 
cashier has gone to the bank." For this reason it is still 
difficult to get used to the fact that the bank has now become, 
in a way, the principal figure not only in economics but also in 
politics. 
  [Klimenko] I could not agree with you more. We did indeed 
turn into a cashier's window for the payment of wages in a 
socialist planned economy, acting under instructions and 
directives. Certainly, reforms in the economy called for 
restructuring financial structures, too. Unfortunately, many 
hasty and ill-conceived steps were taken along the way. As a 
result of recurring reorganizations, our bank, which previously 
pooled the best cadres of specialists, was forced to start from 
scratch. 
  [Kronik] Has your status been determined now? 
  [Klimenko] As you know, a two-tier system has been created 
in 
Russia: the Central Bank and a network of commercial banks. 
  Regardless of its name and structure, in all countries of 
the 
world there is one main bank which puts money into circulation 
and withdraws it, as well as accomplishes a number of other, 
highly necessary tasks. The Central Bank has been declared the 
main bank of the country, and has been charged with pursuing a 
uniform federal monetary policy, regulating monetary 
circulation, ensuring the stability and reinforcing the 
purchasing power of the ruble, and financing capital investment. 
The Central Bank establishes settlement procedures for the 
national economy, protects the interests of depositors, issues 
the banks licenses to perform banking operations, including 
those with foreign exchange, registers charters, and supervises 
the conduct of operations in foreign economic activities. 
  The KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] National Bank, which is 
a 
structural subdivision of the Russian Federation Central Bank, 
must also accomplish all of the aforementioned principal tasks. 
  [Kronik] Incidentally, what is your attitude toward being 
made a member of the KBR government? 
  [Klimenko] I view this as an expression of the recognition 
of 
the role and significance of the KBR National Bank in the 
development of the economy of the republic. This was a personal 
initiative of KBR President V.M. Kokov, who has an excellent 
idea and understanding of the operation of the banking system 
and wishes to take advantage of our closer cooperation to meet 
the needs of the KBR as much as possible. 
  To be sure, participation in the work of the government 
takes 
extra time, but at the same time, interaction with the organs of 
state power makes it possible to resolve pressing issues jointly 
and more promptly. 
  [Kronik] Nikolay Alekseyevich, the views of the second tier, 
the commercial banks, are most contradictory. 
  [Klimenko] A market economy without commercial banks is 
impossible. Please recall that under the old system money was 
squandered right and left; it was frequently invested in 
patently unprofitable projects. Of course, no commercial 
operator who wants to survive would do this. 
  [Kronik] How many commercial banks operate in the republic? 
  [Klimenko] Eleven independent banks and four branches, 
including the Kabardino-Balkar Regional Branch of the 
Rosselkhozbank, with five offices in the rayons, and the 
Joint-Stock Commercial Savings Bank with a chain of branches. 
  [Kronik] Is this a little or a lot? 
  [Klimenko] I think that this is a sufficiently extensive 
network which is in a position to perform the entire complex of 
banking operations in the republic. The establishment of new 
subdivisions has now been suspended, although we do have 10 
petitions; this is primarily associated with higher requirements 
for the newly established banks. 
  [Kronik] Does the operation of commercial banks produce real 
returns? 
  [Klimenko] The independent commercial banks operated in a 
stable manner and turned a profit last year. Proceeding from the 
requirements of the Russian Federation Central Bank, they 
increased their statutory capital to 100 million rubles [R] or 
more. As a result, even under the conditions of inflation, the 
banks were able to considerably raise, out of their proceeds, 
the level of interest rates on funds attracted from the 
population and be worthy competitors for the institutions of the 
Savings Bank. 
  [Kronik] Is their role in investment in the national economy 
of the republic perceptible? 
  [Klimenko] The KBR National Bank still plays a leading role 
in controlling funds from the budget which are earmarked as 
capital investment. In 1993 their volume came to R19 billion. 
  The volume of credit outlays of commercial banks for the 
economy of the republic grew by a factor of 5.8 last year. 
However, centralized resources allocated by the Bank of Russia 
account for one-half in the process, and in some commercial 
banks--for 70 percent. These resources are provided primarily 
for the extension of loans to enterprises and organizations of 
the preferred sectors of the national economy of the KBR, in 
coordination with the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Last year, the increment of centralized credit resources in 
our republic came to 335.4 percent. It was higher than in the 
Russian Federation on the whole, and the highest in the North 
Caucasus region. The credit support provided by the state 
facilitated a degree of stabilization in production in the KBR. 
  However, it is of course necessary for the commercial banks 
to attract the spare funds of enterprises as deposits in order 
to operate in a more stable manner. The banks themselves make a 
poor effort, while economic units are reluctant to give up their 
spare funds, preferring to use such funds for their own needs in 
the environment of continuously high inflation. As a result, the 
commercial banks use in their transactions the temporarily spare 
funds of economic units in settlement and current accounts, thus 
exposing to risk not only themselves but also their clients. 
  [Kronik] You have mentioned that the National Bank has the 
right to monitor the operation of the commercial banks. 
  [Klimenko] The monitoring of the authenticity of accounting 
and statistical reporting and compliance with economic norms is 
entrusted to us. In July of last year we established the 
inspections department. In the time since, two commercial banks 
and three branches have been audited. It came out that the 
monitoring of compliance with cash discipline by enterprises and 
organizations and the proper use of monies from the consumption 
fund is lax. The conditions and the principle of credit 
extension are violated. At times the resources issued are not 
used as earmarked, which brings about late repayment or the 
impossibility of recovering them, and ultimately creates losses 
to the banks themselves, as was the case with the branch of the 
Eurasia commercial bank. Violations were revealed in the conduct 
of accounting and operational work and the drawing up of 
monetary settlement documents. 
  [Kronik] Can you take any enforcement measures? 
  [Klimenko] Directives and warnings on the use of sanctions 
are forwarded based on the results of audits. The sanctions are 
substantial: If economic norms are not complied with, or 
operations that run counter to the law are conducted, we are 
entitled to raise with the founders the issue of taking measures 
to ameliorate the bank's financial situation, replacing its 
manager, or even reorganizing and liquidating it. 
  However, the legislation in effect does not envision control 
over the operation of branches whose banking headquarters are 
located outside of the republic. In general, this legislation 
does not precisely specify the rights of banking commercial 
structures. So it turns out that everything that is not banned 
is allowed. 
  Meanwhile, laws on banks are the rules of the road for 
money. 
Such laws may be good or bad, but they should definitely be the 
same for all. Otherwise, nothing will be in order in the 
country; there will be chaos. 
  [Kronik] There is a reason they say "as safe as in a Swiss 
bank" when they want to stress the reliability of the 
safekeeping of valuables.... 
  [Klimenko] Certainly, the reputation of a bank means a lot; 
it is built over centuries, not even decades. Please recall that 
in prerevolutionary Russia even the bank buildings themselves 
were imposing and respectable, underscoring how serious and 
significant the operations performed inside them were. 
  [Kronik] In this reference, we would like to know how the 
notorious case in which a number of commercial banks of the KBR 
credited false transfers in April and May 1992 ended. 
  [Klimenko] At the time a wave of crediting sums under forged 
transfers swept over Russia. Despite a warning from the Central 
Bank, no due attention and vigilance was shown here, which 
brought about forged transfers being credited to the accounts of 
commercial structures from Nalchik, Nartkala, and Baksan 
totaling R1,387,009,000 (the Nalchik commercial bank, a branch 
of the Rosselkhozbank, the Chegem, and the Savings Bank). 
  A large proportion of such forged transfers was intercepted 
through the joint efforts of the KBR National Bank and the 
commercial banks of the republic. The remainder, approximately 
R300 million, still has not been recovered. The KBR law 
enforcement organs have instituted criminal proceedings based on 
all of these cases. 
  [Kronik] What does the KBR National Bank do to protect 
banking documents? 
  [Klimenko] We have implemented a system of up-to-date 
technical protection features for payments; we are using the 
method of data coding. A new system for transporting banking 
documentation within the KBR has been organized. Methods for the 
exchange of information between banks have been modified. We 
should note in particular that all work, even top secret work, 
is done by specific employees whom they tried and are still 
trying to bribe and whom they threaten with physical harm. In 
order to avoid unpleasant facts, personal chains for mutual and 
repeated control over the processing of banking documents have 
been established at all Clearing Centers. If a forgery gets 
through at one stage, it will certainly be detected at others. 
Of course, special attention is being paid to the selection of 
cadres, their reliability and integrity. 
  [Kronik] What measures have you taken to speed up 
settlements 
in the national economy? 
  [Klimenko] Our answer to this question should be divided 
into 
two parts. They are settlements within the KBR and settlements 
effected with other regions of the Russian Federation. 
  Since the middle of last year our Clearing Centers have been 
effecting settlements between the banks of the city and in the 
rayons within the same day, with funds being credited to the 
accounts of clients on the following day. The introduction of a 
new method for the exchange of information on magnetic media 
(computer diskettes) and the extensive use of technical assets 
facilitated this procedure. 
  Intrarepublic settlements with all rayons of the KBR are 
effected on the second or third business day, with funds being 
credited to the accounts of clients on the third or fourth 
business day. We have rejected postal services and deliver all 
correspondence there ourselves. Incidentally, such deadlines for 
effecting settlements are in line with commonly accepted foreign 
norms. 
  [Kronik] And outside of the republic? 
  [Klimenko] With a view to speeding up the movement of 
banking 
documents outside the KBR, solely the state courier service has 
been used since July 1992. The service delivers documents within 
two to five business days to all oblast and kray seats of 
Russia, with their protection guaranteed. 
  Standard deadlines for cable and postal transfers have also 
been established. However, numerous instances of forged 
transfers, so-called "Chechen advice notes," being sent have 
unfortunately forced the Central Bank of the Russian Federation 
to establish special control over settlements effected, for the 
most part, in the region of the North Caucasus, where 
Kabardino-Balkaria is. This considerably delays the crediting of 
funds outside the KBR. 
  However, practice indicates that such control is not at all 
in vain. In the last 1.5 years alone the employees of our bank 
and the Clearing Centers have prevented the theft of R10.307 
billion, as well as detected forged advice notes ostensibly 
generated at the KBR National Bank for R52.067 billion. 
  [Kronik] When will regular procedures for settlements of the 
KBR at the interregional level be restored? 
  [Klimenko] This depends on the effectiveness of the efforts 
of law enforcement organs to put an end to forced transfers and, 
most importantly, on the speed of the introduction of a more 
reliable transmittal of banking information. Thus, the plan is 
to introduce the Bankir satellite communication system which 
should ensure interbank settlements in the territory of Russia 
on the same day before the end of 1994. A special-purpose 
program for information services developed by the Central Bank 
of the Russian Federation is also being implemented. It is based 
on a system of electronic payments which makes it possible to 
exchange banking information without paper documents, through 
communication channels, with the necessary protective features. 
  [Kronik] At the moment the banking system is frequently 
blamed for the existing, most complex situation involving mutual 
nonpayments. 
  [Klimenko] This criticism is not leveled at the culprits. 
The 
liberalization of prices, the severance of economic relations, 
the introduction of prepayments for goods and services, and a 
multitude of other objective and subjective causes have brought 
about an "eating away" of the internal working capital of most 
enterprises and organizations. All of these have caused mutual 
nonpayments to snowball; in the KBR, mutual nonpayments exceeded 
R100 billion. 
  Last year, the repayment of loans to the banks deteriorated. 
The defaulted debt increased sharply. A particularly difficult 
situation developed in the agro-industrial complex. 
  The KBR Cabinet of Ministers resolved to conduct the 
offsetting of mutual claims in order to reduce the mutual 
indebtedness of economic units. However, it is necessary for the 
Government of the Russian Federation to allocate funds for 
conducting an offset throughout the territory of Russia because 
the enterprises of our republic also engage in settlements 
outside of its territory. If this is not done, the chain of 
nonpayments will in all likelihood reach commercial banks, which 
may drive them to the brink of bankruptcy. 
  [Kronik] Residents of our republic are traveling abroad more 
and more often. For this reason, the foreign exchange policy is 
of special interest. Have there been any changes in the new year? 
  [Klimenko] Without infringing on the freedom of commercial 
banks, the KBR National Bank monitors compliance with 
legislative and regulatory acts concerning foreign exchange 
operations. In January of this year new procedures were 
introduced for currency control over the receipt in the Russian 
Federation of foreign exchange proceeds from the exports of 
goods. All exporters now must draw up transaction profiles for 
contracts at authorized banks prior to the shipment of the 
freight abroad, and submit the profiles to the Customs 
Committee. Previously an exporter could leave foreign exchange 
proceeds at a foreign bank, whereas the new procedure which 
provides for three layers of control will make it possible to 
rule out the outflow of capital abroad. 
  [Kronik] Where can foreign exchange be purchased and sold 
locally? 
  [Klimenko] Seven authorized commercial banks in the republic 
hold licenses to conduct foreign exchange operations issued by 
the Russian Federation Central Bank: Nalchik, Bum-Bank, 
Prokhladnyy, Nart, Oshkhamakho, Namys, and Kavkaz-Inkombank, 
along with two branches: of the Rosselkhozbank and the Savings 
Bank commercial bank. 
  Settlements in foreign exchange cash have been banned on the 
territory of Russia since January. Nonetheless, the demand of 
the population for foreign exchange is growing, and the reserves 
are being replenished in a timely manner. 
  [Kronik] A majority of the population is concerned about 
regular rubles, after all. Will we receive them in a timely 
manner? 
  [Klimenko] Unlike the year 1992, when a cash shortage was 
felt, the KBR National Bank and its Clearing Centers met the 
needs of the national economy of the republic for currency fully 
and without delays last year, including coins whose total weight 
came to about 108 tonnes, or almost two railway carloads. 
Therefore, all talk of the bank not issuing money is a result of 
a lack of funds in the settlement accounts of enterprises and 
organizations. 
  [Kronik] However, are you not concerned with safekeeping 
this 
cash? 
  [Klimenko] A reliable security and alarm system exists to 
this end. At any rate, there have been no emergencies so far.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker under the rubric "Lobbying": </F>
"The `Siberian Accord' Demands Revision of Taxes: MASS 
Recommends the Government Increase Region's Budget Financing"] 
  [Text] The economic conference on problems of the 
development of Siberia which opens today in Novosibirsk with the 
planned participation of Leonid Abalkin, Yegor Gaydar, and 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy subscribes to the plan of the "Siberian 
Accord" Interregional Association (MASS): to raise its political 
status in order to lobby successfully in the center for the 
region's interests, as the local elite groups understand those 
interests. Just a month ago in discussing the concept and 
strategy of Siberia's development in Moscow, MASS announced that 
the economic reforms had not resulted in "stabilization of the 
economic situation in Siberia," but, on the contrary, "a number 
of base complexes are on the verge of complete disorganization 
and collapse." Naturally, the association decided to take on the 
"creation of constructive mechanisms for the positive reform of 
the economy." 
  The development of "constructive mechanisms" was above all 
focused on changing relations between the federal and 
territorial budgets and on making adjustments in tax policy. 
Lamenting Moscow's subjectiveness in calculating the income and 
expenditures of Siberia's krays and oblasts, MASS proposed a 
typical solution--increase the region's state budget financing. 
But in fact, in order to remove Siberians' suspicions of one 
another on the subject of "whom the Ministry of Finance favored 
more," the leadership of the oblasts should have published the 
local budgets. On this basis, the question could have been posed 
of redistributing within the region amounts already pledged to 
the federal budget. But the "Siberian Accord" instead proposed 
that the government increase the proportion of value-added tax 
(VAT) left to the territories. 
  Seeming to forget that this proportion had already been 
raised starting this year, MASS is prepared to act as the 
disrupter of the entire budget design. It proposes to revise the 
rates of the personal profit tax, VAT, and income tax. To 
decrease them, naturally, but only that part which goes for 
republic-wide needs. Apart from demanding that state injections 
of capital be increased, the Association gave the recommendation 
"to form a special reserve fund for financial support of regions 
in the federal budget." But MASS did not indicate, as is 
customary in such cases, the source of the fund's formation. 
  The appeal to the Council of Ministers to revise its decree 
No 1233 "On Reappraisal of Working Capital" is no less 
surprising. MASS explains its concern by saying that reappraisal 
of the value of enterprises leads to a jump in prices of their 
output, and after that comes another sequence of nonpayments, 
lower profits, and reduced tax revenue to the budget. It is 
remarkable that it was precisely enterprises and territorial 
authorities which bombarded the Cabinet of Ministers all of last 
year, demanding that working capital be reappraised, saying that 
otherwise it would be impossible to increase depreciation 
deductions and capital investments for developing production. 
But now MASS announces: "An alternative to this variant is an 
increase in monetary capital in circulation equal to the rise in 
prices." In this way, MASS is essentially advising the 
government to add the inflation of demand (the rise in prices 
through the increase in the amount of money the consumer has) to 
the supposedly inevitable inflation of the seller's costs. 
  But, perhaps, another recommendation of Siberians is out of 
competition, to abolish Point 8 of the State Tax Committee 
instructions which defines the procedure for enterprises and 
organizations to pay tax on profit to the budget. Commodity 
producers complain about this instruction because supposedly it 
prevents them from lowering prices for goods and output. In 
answering such claims made at one of the conferences of 
directors, First Vice-President Oleg Soskovets said: "Consider 
there to be no such instruction." But the tax organs have 
repeatedly caught enterprises for artificially reducing prices 
of output (for the purpose of formally reducing profit and 
thereby taxes). Frequently Russian enterprises trade at real 
prices and list "reduced" prices in the transport invoices. And 
as a rule this is not accompanied by any resolution of 
nonpayments or any freeing of warehouse space. 
  On the whole, MASS's approaches to regulating foreign 
economic activity, pretentions to price and rate controls on 
energy and railroad shipments, desire to revise relations of 
ownership between the federal and territorial levels, and 
readiness to adjust budget and tax policy confirm that the 
"Siberian Accord" is attempting to revive the economic 
organization of the 1950s, the sovnarkhoz [regional economic 
council].

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Illarionov: "How the Reduction of the </F>
Administrative Apparat Is Understood in Novosibirsk"] 
  [Text] In recent months the mayor's office in Novosibirsk 
has cut the administrative apparat by one-quarter. This 
happened, strange as it may seem, quietly, perhaps because it 
was drowned out by the noisy events of September-October in 
Moscow. And then by the elections to the federal and local 
assemblies. 
  Studying the structure of the mayor's office, I was quite 
puzzled. The basic functional subdivisions pretentiously called 
departments all the same correspond, in my opinion, to the 
present basic tasks of the city executive authority for managing 
economic and social life. But the "mayor's department" caused 
considerable doubt. Why, I wondered, turn the necessary and 
practical managerial secretariat into some kind of apparat over 
the apparat or department over the departments? We must give due 
credit to I. Indink, mayor of Novosibirsk at the time, whose 
initiative it was to establish this department. The mayor was 
objective and self-critical enough to eliminate it himself. 
  Another thing which struck me in the former structure of the 
Novosibirsk mayor's office was the inventiveness of its authors 
in the names of sections and officials. For example, there is 
the interaction and ties with organs of local government section 
or the economic advisor-chief of the 
organizational-administrative section. Today, the functions of 
the sections have been clarified as personnel have been reduced. 
There are fewer advisors and consultants, who were more likely 
to consult with their own highly competent managers. 
  The reductions for the most part affected those associates 
of 
the mayor's office who did not live up to the expectations of 
them. And some of them very sensibly quit, without waiting for 
it to be suggested to them. The present mayor, V. Tolokonskiy, 
must be given due credit for his practical and consistent 
approach to implementing this delicate and difficult measure. 
  Can one say that the mayor's office is closer to the optimum 
model after the reductions? There are no miracles: even 
administrative structures, especially in a time of transition, 
are doomed to constant and acutely painful refinement. So it is 
in Novosibirsk too. Essentially structural changes were 
suggested and made back before the reductions in personnel were 
completed. For example, the architectural construction and power 
engineering departments were combined into one. This was 
obviously dictated not so much by the need to save money as the 
need to get away from primitive cliches. 
  It is very difficult today for great Siberian science. And 
in 
the mayor's office the question has arisen of creating a small 
but qualified group to see to its survival. Today this is very 
important for Russia, and for the oblast, and for the city. 
  The next thing is creation of the apparat of the Novosibirsk 
oblast administration. The development of the corresponding 
program is being completed. It is a different matter that the 
search for the optimum structure of the mayor's office or the 
administration would better be made not through trial and error, 
but on the basis of competent scientific recommendations, and to 
do that Russia needs scientific collectives which have mastered 
the problems of organization of the work of the administrative 
apparat.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Maltsev: "Criminal Millions"] </F>
  [Text] One scandal follows another: Corporations and 
consortiums collect a bit of money from trusting citizens, and 
later disappear into thin air along with large sums of money. 
The citizens moan and groan and...once again take their money to 
the next "benefactor." 
  Three major swindles burst forth almost simultaneously: two 
in Moscow and one in Novosibirsk. Muscovites "were made happy" 
by the Independent Oil Concern, which collected 260 billion in 
three months of existence, and by the investment fund 
Oil-Diamonds-Invest, whose business was also not 
inconsequential. But if the words "oil," "diamond," 
"investment," and so forth, sound magical to the capital's 
investors, it seems it was even easier to deceive residents of 
Novosibirsk. 
  A certain joint-stock company of the closed 
type--Fineko--which allegedly was a branch of the Irkutsk Credit 
Industrial Bank, simply announced in a TV commercial that it was 
beginning to pay b-i-g interest rates for money it collected, 
specifically, 30 percent per month. The minimum payment, of 
course, had to be not less than a million. But, as can be seen, 
the matter did not stop here: In one week, 150 million was 
collected. Were it not for the vigilance of the law enforcement 
organs, the volume of the swindle would be no less than the 
capital "oil swindle." 
  Absolutely all Fineko's documents were fakes, including the 
license granting the right to financial operations. 
  The victims of the fraud were mainly people of pension age. 
  The victims of the Moscow swindle in those days even came to 
a rally demanding protection from the authorities. 
  This is a very difficult task, given the current legislative 
base and the unstable economic situation. It is precisely for 
this reason that people fall for the bait, inasmuch as they want 
to guard their money against inflation. After all, each time 
they were induced by promises of high interest. 
  "Such promises in fact do not always reflect a capability to 
fulfill them, but rather they are a signal for the law 
enforcement organs to be interested in how legal the activities 
of the `enrichers' is," Viktor Sushentsev, deputy chief of the 
West Siberian Regional Administration in the Fight against 
Organized Crime, to whom the editorial office turned for 
information on this matter, commented about the Fineko swindle. 
  This time, intuition did not let our protectors down, 
otherwise many more people would have been deceived. Still, what 
is to be done, if you want to guard against similar unpleasant 
occurrences? 
  The most general advice is provided by an historical example 
of a highly inflationary period in Italy. People were simply not 
saving at all. It is said that at that time stores and 
restaurants there were filled: The Italians were attempting to 
get rid of money on their own pleasures, since it was no longer 
possible to accumulate it. 
  The second piece of advice: Before turning over your money 
it 
is necessary to convince yourself that the receiving side has 
the right to engage in investment operations. 
  Nikolay Beloslyudtsev, deputy chief of the main 
administration of the Central Bank for Novosibirsk Oblast, said 
that such a right is granted by a license to conduct banking 
operations. 
  What is to be done if the license is forged, what does a 
genuine one look like, and what if the ordinary investor does 
not know? 
  The main administrations of the Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation in the territories has all of the information on the 
issuance of licenses. If the clients of Fineko had inquired at 
the main administration concerning the Irkutsk Credit Industrial 
Bank, it is very likely they would have been able to ascertain 
that such a bank did not exist at all. 
  One should not take extreme positions and think that 
everyone 
who does not have a banking license but who works with money 
received from the population is an outright swindler. Of course 
not. But in any case it is necessary to be concerned about 
guarantees for your money and get the maximum information about 
those firms with which you intend to do business. 
  A banking license, of course, is the reliable guarantee 
here, 
inasmuch as its owner is obligated to form insurance funds in 
the event of its ruin, so that investors do not suffer at the 
same time. It is mainly banks that possess such licenses. Among 
nonbank structures there are not many as such, and almost all of 
them are located in Moscow. 
  A law on advertising could be a distinctive protective 
mechanism. If the advertiser bore legislative responsibility for 
texts published in the press and broadcast on radio and TV, then 
probably it would be possible to institute proceedings 
immediately, without waiting for a scandal. After all, it is 
clear to every reasonable person: A yeast fungus has not been 
invented yet for cultivating money. And the capabilities of 
known catalyzers of this process are very limited.

<F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent Aleksandr </F>
Bulygin, Krasnodar: "The Kuban `Hawks' Are Already Dividing the 
Portfolios"] 
  [Text] It would seem that the dream of ruling to one's 
heart's content has so mastered even the minds of certain of our 
fellow journalists that it gives them no rest, even by day or by 
night. Krasnodar has a regional newspaper, KUBANSKIY KURER, and 
at its editorial office is the kray headquarters of the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the leaders of which 
cannot be suspected of having an excessive amount of modesty. 
More than three months before the election to agencies of local 
self-government, the Kuban "hawks" announced the formation of a 
kray Legislative Assembly and a governmental cabinet. 
  The main portfolios were distributed, naturally, among the 
closest retainers. The person who was seated in the chair of the 
shady governor was Vladimir Serdyukov, the head of the LDPR kray 
organization, who also performs the duties of head of the 
Sociopolitical Research Department at KUBANSKIY KURER. The job 
of chairman of the Legislative Assembly was yielded to Igor 
Kolomiytsev, with this action apparently emphasizing 
faithfulness to their principle of not forgetting services 
rendered to them. Because Igor Pavlovich had done rather well in 
providing services: during a short period of time the KUBANSKIY 
KURER that is edited by him was converted into a mouthpiece for 
the Zhirinovskiyites. So the deputy of the main Kuban "hawk," 
Sergey Kamarinskiy, had to be satisfied with the title of the 
shady general director of the department for the fight against 
corruption. 
  As you compare these personnel assignments, you have to 
sympathize with the professionals, for example, with military 
jurist Anatoliy Vetrov, who was given only the job of business 
manager of the kray Duma. One can only guess how the already 
appointed shady prefects of Anapskiy, Yeyskiy, Korenovskiy, 
Labinskiy, and Mostovskiy rayons, and the mayors of the cities 
of Yeysk and Sochi, will execute the "assignment" issued by the 
LDPR kray organization, of making up cabinets for the local 
agencies of authority within a one-month period. 
  As early as January, the leader of the Kuban 
liberal-democrats, Serdyukov, publicly and with complete 
seriousness, stated that Nikolay Yegorov, the present 
administration head of Krasnodar Kray, "sooner or later will 
have a need to join up with us... If Yegorov establishes contact 
with us, and gives us several departments today, then we shall 
not forget him tomorrow." But the "hawklets" had a misfire: the 
governor did not react in any way to the bait put out by the 
Zhirinovskiyites. Andrey Ivanov, press secretary of the kray 
administration head, stated that the kray's executive authority 
had been formed from professionals and is operating in 
everyone's full view. No personnel shakeup in favor of anyone's 
political vanities is foreseen. Everything will be decided by 
the voters. 
  A valid question is: whom can the authority trust? How will 
the people of Kuban evaluate (or will they evaluate?) the zeal 
of the local "hawks, their struggle for seats in the kray Duma, 
and their emulation of Communists at such time? Because the 
Zhirinovskiyites do not spare even the Travkinites. Serdyukov 
has indeed stated, "We do not have anything against former CPSU 
members. But for all 'demorossy' [members of 
Democratic Russia] the path to us is closed..." 
  As the saying goes, the masks have been thrown aside. And 
apparently in time. So that the voters will have time to 
scrutinize the situation a bit more attentively. There is still 
time: it is a few months until autumn and the election.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Nesmeyanov, chairman of the Communists of </F>
Maritime Kray electoral bloc coordinating council, by KRASNOYE 
ZNAMYA correspondent Vitaliy Mogil; place and date not given: 
"April Is Thesis Time"] 
  [Text] Kray communists were one of the political 
forces objecting to the kray administration decision to move the 
duma elections to the fall. Our KRASNOYE ZNAMYA correspondent 
met with A. Nesmeyanov, chairman of the Communists of Maritime 
Kray electoral bloc coordinating council. 
  [Mogil] Anatoliy Vladimirovich, it is well known that there 
is no unity in the national and kray communist movement. 
Nevertheless, members of different parties of a communist bent 
are going into the elections to the kray duma and local 
self-rule bodies as a bloc. What has prompted them to unite? 
  [Nesmeyanov] The stimulus for joining forces was our failure 
at the elections to the State Duma, when the two largest party 
organizations: the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and 
the Russian Communist Workers Party--nominated their candidates 
independently of one another and did not gather the needed 
number of votes. 
  Now the Communists of Maritime Kray electoral bloc, in 
addition to the aforementioned parties, includes the kray 
organization of the VKPB [All-Russia Communist Party of 
Bolsheviks] (I do not think the abbreviation needs expansion) 
and the public movement in defense of V.I. Lenin. 
  [Mogil] Is the combined force being successful? 
  [Nesmeyanov] We think so. The stage of candidate nomination 
and registration has been completed successfully. Of 39 kray 
duma electoral districts, our candidates are registered in 21. 
Registering so many candidates also has served another cause. 
The communists have been able to break the information blockade 
the mass media, especially television and radio, had placed on 
us. Thanks to air time on radio and television set aside for 
candidates' appearances, we have been able to tell people about 
ourselves and our program. 
  [Mogil] Tell us then about the substance of your program. 
  [Nesmeyanov] The main goal of the communists has not 
changed. 
It is socioeconomic protection of the workers. I think that in 
the current situation that exists in Maritime Kray we will find 
voter support. Therefore, the kray administration's decision to 
move the elections to the fall is not at all to our benefit. 
  [Mogil] Have you reconciled yourselves with it? 
  [Nesmeyanov] There is not much hope that we will be listened 
to, but the Communists of Maritime Kray bloc sent a protest 
against this decision to the kray administration, State Duma, 
and Central Electoral Commission. As the governor's decree 
states, the postponement of the elections was prompted by 
"numerous requests from the administrations of kray cities and 
rayons." This violates the democratic norms of separating the 
executive and legislative branches of power--something the 
current democrats were so intent on just recently. Today all the 
levers of authority are concentrated in the hands of 
administration heads and their staff, without any effective 
oversight of them by the people. Such structures have the 
coloration of dictatorship--and not faded at that--and once 
again unmask the system of presidential authority, and its 
inability to ensure free and truly democratic elections in 
Russia. 
  Overall, we firmly oppose Yeltsin's reforms and, 
consequently, the kray administration, which is the conduit of 
these reforms in Maritime Kray. The communists are always open 
to dialogue, however. 
  [Mogil] Still, if we assume that the elections will be held 
in the fall... 
  [Nesmeyanov] We will continue our work. At a recent meeting 
at which our candidates for deputy were present, they were 
instructed to continue the election campaign and meet with the 
people more.

<F P=106> [Interview Vladimir Kolesnichenko, vice president of the </F>
Maritime Joint-Stock Goods Producers Company, by VLADIVOSTOK 
correspondent Vitaliy Korytko; place and date not given: 
"Vladimir Kolesnichenko: PACT Is Ready To Take Upon Itself the 
Burden of Structural Restructuring of the Kray Economy"] 
  [Text] As is known, the "PACT [Maritime Joint-Stock 
Goods Producers Company] case," which certain circles have very 
persistently tried to make look strictly criminal, drew a 
blank--the competent organs did not find any serious violations 
in this organization's activities and therefore refused to 
initiate criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, let us not forget 
that for a long time PACT's name has been literally a permanent 
fixture on the pages of some local newspapers (now no longer 
published), which organized the hounding of "red directors," who 
allegedly [line missing] of Maritime Kray's economic 
potential... PACT's real work meanwhile remained, as they say, 
outside the framework. 
  Our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent asked PACT's Vice 
President Vladimir Kolesnichenko to describe what this 
organization was really doing and what it intends to do after 
its "exoneration." 
  [Kolesnichenko] All this time we have been doing the same 
thing as before--developing within PACT's framework a mechanism 
for structural restructuring of the kray economy. 
  Why did we of all people undertake this task? PACT, which is 
a financial-industrial group, or consortium, is the first 
structure in Russia set up on the Western model, with an 
orientation toward a high degree of survivability in a 
free-market environment--both of the corporation as a whole and 
each of its component enterprises. 
  In short, we took as a basis the "keiretsu" 
system--currently 
the most effective form of enterprise integration in the world. 
Having integrated themselves into a multisectoral concern, which 
typically has its own bank, trading companies, joint ownership 
of stock, and so on, these enterprises orient themselves in 
terms of earning profits mainly at investing in the most 
promising developments, as well as further commercialization of 
interrelated products and markets. This, by the way, explains 
why Japan, where the "keiretsu" system is most widely used, is 
winning the competition against the United States today. 
  In September of last year the Ministry of the Economy 
approved the initiative to create PACT; a decision was made to 
conduct an experiment and then extend our experience to all of 
Russia, testimony of which was the president's December decree 
on the creation of financial-industrial groups in the country. 
Then, however, political intrigues around PACT began, involving 
audits by uncountable commissions from the government, financial 
organs, the procuracy, and even state security, which, although 
not quite paralyzing the organization's activities, did 
considerably slow down the work on structural restructuring that 
had at first taken off very energetically. Now the situation has 
changed. 
  No matter how much Government Decree No. 1001 is berated, it 
has been implemented at least in one respect: The kray has been 
granted a very preferential rate in paying for electric power 
(40 rubles [R] per kilowatt). Had it not been for this, the kray 
economy would have ground to a halt as early as last fall. In 
May, however, we expect a sharp jump in thermal-electric power 
rates for industrial consumers--the government says that it is 
no longer able to maintain such low rates. It is not difficult 
to predict what will happen then--half the enterprises will find 
themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, and a considerable part 
of the labor force (in our estimates, between 20 and 40 percent) 
may be laid off. That is, we have practically approached the 
point of having no time left for "contemplation." 
  A considerable part of PACT is comprised of former defense 
enterprises reorganized into joint-stock companies and 
undergoing conversion. The situation there is very difficult 
now. Military production at these enterprises for all practical 
purposes has been suspended; people are not paid wages (or if 
they are paid, it is in miserable amounts), but neither are they 
told what to do. Maintenance of these "dead" production 
facilities is done essentially at the expense of stockholders, 
which is a road straight to bankruptcy. 
  In other words, collectives have found themselves in a sort 
of economic trap. Very soon annual stockholder meetings will 
begin at these enterprises, and people may demand dividends on 
their stock. They have a right to ask the board of every AO 
[joint-stock company]: Why do banks and investment funds produce 
capital and pay dividends, and you cannot? What we would like to 
do is to decide at each such meeting--taking into account 
stockholders' opinion, of course--what to produce, which 
production may be halted, where to sell the products, and so on. 
But first the government must decide where it stands and finally 
say clearly that at such and such enterprises in the kray it is 
in the interests of the state to produce such and such output in 
such and such volume, etc. Our proposals in this respect, 
including full conversion of defense enterprises, are already in 
the State Committee on Industry and are a component part of the 
kray program of structural restructuring of the economy. The 
government is preparing its own version of such restructuring, 
but in principle the entire burden of practical implementation 
will fall on the kray. 
  We have to our own thinking--no good uncle will help us in 
this--on how to preserve jobs by starting production of 
competitive products that consumers need, and finding markets 
for their distribution--including abroad. It will probably be a 
very painful process. Structural restructuring of the economy is 
no rose garden; some lay-offs are inevitable, and therefore, I 
want to repeat, the priority problem we will have to deal with 
is how and where to employ these people. This is not a problem 
that is limited to PACT. Structural restructuring will extend to 
the entire kray, and this is at a time when we cannot really 
count on any significant help on the part of the state. 
  In our calculations, structural restructuring of the kray 
economy in 1994 will require R2.3 trillion in current prices; 
nobody will give us this kind of money, of course. But we have a 
kind of counterproposal to the state: Since you do not have this 
money, let us work on signing an agreement with China on sales 
of Maritime Kray products in its markets, first and foremost in 
its northern provinces. There is no doubt that our industrial 
potential is higher than that at many Chinese enterprises, and 
therefore we can be competitive with them. The same may be said 
regarding the markets of North Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and 
Indonesia. We should not be afraid to take our products there; 
we also need to look for investors and find them. For instance, 
we already have concrete developments with respect to investment 
intents on the part of a number of Taiwanese companies. 
  Over the past year the consolidated profit of PACT 
enterprises amounted to R87 billion. This is a considerable 
amount, but probably is not enough for every one of the 
corporation's component enterprises. What enterprises are in 
most acute need of today is first and foremost capital, money. 
Since we cannot count on outside help, we in PACT intend to 
apply internally the method of "pulling ourselves up by the 
bootstraps." The substance of this is that the government will 
give us the right, so to say, on a tax-free basis to direct part 
of the profits generated, for instance, by Dalpribor, into the 
development of, for instance, a Vladivostok meat-processing 
plant. We are not talking about "charity" here--this project 
will be presented to Dalpribor stockholders, with the length of 
time needed to receive a payoff and returns on investment, the 
prospects for the new production, etc. This is what structural 
restructuring is: First we pull up one segment, then another... 
I am convinced that today this is the only real way, which we 
need to take. 
  Of course, some may think that there is too much abstract 
reasoning in this. What structural restructuring of the economy, 
they say--people have to live today, and wages are low... But in 
most cases this is precisely why they are so low--there is no 
way to pay more if production is either idle or operating at 
half capacity, producing goods that accumulate in warehouses and 
cannot be sold. Therefore, as I have already said, the 
"wait-and-see" period is over, unless we shift production as 
soon as possible into making products everyone needs, while 
preserving jobs (or creating new ones), unless we find new 
distribution markets, unless we train a completely new type of 
managers to run these enterprises, and do many other things, the 
crisis in the kray economy may indeed reach extremes. 
  The time of uncertainty and talk is over; it is time to act 
now. PACT is ready to be the first to start this difficult work.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Ignatenko, Russian Federation presidential </F>
representative in Maritime Kray, and V. Maslakov, director of 
Far Eastern plant Zvezda, under the rubric "Official Version": 
"The Problem of Radioactive Waste in Maritime Kray Is Not Going 
To Be Solved on a Populist Wave"] 
  [Text] Lately, kray (and not only kray) mass media have 
been discussing especially energetically and quite intensely the 
problem of utilization of liquid radioactive waste accumulated 
by the Pacific Fleet both in its arsenals and at the Far Eastern 
plant Zvezda. Unfortunately, a rather considerable number of 
these materials are of a clearly populist nature and are not 
distinguished by objectivity or a balanced approach. And such 
irresponsible statements as "the bay will die and the population 
will have to be evacuated," give rise to all sorts of rumors and 
conjectures that any time now the end of the world is coming to 
Maritime Kray. Residents of the town of Bolshoy Kamen are being 
especially subjected to this kind of scare tactics. 
  Such a frivolous approach to an extremely serious matter not 
only does not help solve the problem but also aggravates its 
moral and psychological aspects and distracts Maritime Kray 
residents from the substance of the matter and the way to deal 
with it. 
  It is true that large quantities of liquid radioactive waste 
(LRW) have accumulated in Pacific Fleet arsenals at the Far 
Eastern plant Zvezda. TNT-5, TNT-27, and Pinega tankers, as well 
as two floating reservoirs of PEK-50 type with a capacity of 100 
tonnes, are being utilized for its collection, temporary 
storage, and transportation. However, the TNT-5 tanker, which 
was decommissioned in 1992, is practically falling apart. 
  These capacities will be able to accept over the next half a 
year about 170 tonnes of LRW. One would think that we still have 
a safety margin of six months to take steps in the direction of 
creating new capacities for utilization or storage of LRW. This 
is not so, however. We do not have this margin, because 170 
tonnes of LRW is clearly not enough to fulfill the current 
year's state program for ship repair and utilization. Not only 
will an important state defense order not be fulfilled, but also 
a great number of Bolshoy Kamen residents will be left without 
work. Moreover, as specialists point out, it is impermissible to 
continue keeping TNT-5 in the plant's aquatic area. Its tanks 
contain 794 tonnes of LRW with a total activity of 0.78 curies. 
There is simply no solution other than towing TNT-5 outside the 
plant's territory and dumping its contents into the sea (which, 
by the way, is what other countries that possess nuclear fleets 
do). Otherwise, we cannot avoid the serious consequences of the 
tanker's depressurization. 
  It should be emphasized that today the practice of 
radioactive waste (RW) disposal at sea in our country represents 
the only possible way to ensure functioning of nuclear-powered 
ships and vessels. France and England do the same, as a matter 
of fact. They have been granted this right, however, under the 
International Convention for Protection of Marine Environment in 
the Northeast Atlantic Area, which envisages a phase-out of RW 
disposal at sea by the year 2018. 
  In our case, the critical situation with TNT-5 is 
exacerbated 
by the fact that the Russian Federation government adopted a 
decision in the fall of 1993 to ban dumping waste into the sea. 
Having imposed the ban, however, it has not made the second 
step--offering a solution to the problem. What needed to be done 
was to provide our Russian scientists with the opportunity to 
implement their versions of LRW reprocessing and allocate the 
necessary means for it. This has not been done. As a result, we 
have a dilemma: either idle the plants and limit the activities 
of the Russian Navy, or violate the government ban and carry out 
unauthorized dumping of LRW in the Sea of Japan or other part of 
the Pacific Ocean. The former "either" is simply impossible. 
This leaves the latter--dumping into the sea. 
  In our opinion, kray Governor Ye. Nazdratenko, looking into 
the root of the problem, made the absolutely correct statement 
that in the event the Russian government does not provide 
financing for resolution of the problem of LRW storage and 
reprocessing, in order to avoid an ecological catastrophe 
Maritime Kray authorities will be forced to order a halt in 
production resulting in LRW and dump the waste stored at TNT-5 
and TNT-27 in specially designated areas of the Sea of Japan, on 
the concurrence of the president. This is a very important and 
courageous decision, and all Maritime Kray residents ought to 
support it. 
  Now regarding waste reprocessing. The technology for its 
utilization is more or less the same. Solid radioactive waste 
(SRW)--equipment dismantled from nuclear power generation 
systems, such as pumps, steam generators, pipelines, and so 
on--are reprocessed with the purpose of reducing their volume 
and activity level. SRW is collected in containers and then 
buried at disposal sites specially designated and equipped for 
this purpose--as a rule, on the territories of countries that 
own this waste. These sites must meet a considerable number of 
requirements that are in line with both state and international 
rules and terms. 
  There are two options for purification of liquid waste. 
  One is evaporation. In this case the resulting substances 
are 
purified water and brine. Brine has a high level of activity, 
and therefore is subjected to further reprocessing in order to 
reduce its volume and subsequently bury it at SRW disposal 
sites. This option has a serious shortcoming--it is very 
energy-intensive and is not a good solution in the environment 
of constant energy crisis in Maritime Kray. 
  The second option is water purification through filtration 
by 
special compounds. The setup itself is simple: an unpurified 
water tank, pumps that push the water through filters, a 
purified water tank, and a control and automation system. 
Servicing this system is quite simple and does not require great 
expenditures--in terms of either energy or labor. For reliable 
operation it requires six to eight persons for a two-shift 
operation. 
  In our opinion, a temporary and easiest-to-implement version 
of this system is installed on a pontoon or a barge. In the 
current situation this is the preferable option. Such a mobile 
system could play the role of an "ambulance" of sorts--they can 
be quickly towed to wherever LRW storage is reaching capacity. 
  Regretfully, Russia does not yet have a service (which it 
should have within the Ministry of Atomic Energy system) engaged 
in utilization of radioactive waste--both liquid and solid. The 
leadership of the Russian Navy believes that this is not their 
problem: The task of the Navy is to ensure defense of the state 
at sea. Ship-repair plants, of which Zvezda is one, exist for 
the purpose of ship and vessel repair, and reprocessing LRW is 
not their specialty. What is the Maritime Kray administration to 
do in this situation? 
  This is a far from rhetorical question; it long ago moved 
into the realm of practice. Our Japanese neighbors, having 
resolved it long ago, have offered to help. Their systems 
operate not only in Japan and not only for purification of LRW 
but also for purification of higher toxicity waste. 
  Russia also has specialists and scientists in the area of 
LRW 
reprocessing, including in Maritime Kray. What our scientists 
offer, however, is only at the laboratory stage. It will take 
time and money to organize a competition for the best project 
and then implement it. We do not have either. 
  Therefore we see this potential solution to the current 
situation: support Ye. Nazdratenko's proposal to ask Japan, 
which is an interested party, to provide monetary aid or LRW 
reprocessing systems. Bring Japanese firms into resolution of 
these problems, and provide aid directly to Maritime Kray, 
bypassing Moscow. 
  This solution, however, also requires certain time: Japanese 
companies estimate that at least six months will pass between 
the time financing is provided and the system is put in 
operation. While the matter of financing is being resolved in 
the Russian "top echelons," however, the clock is ticking 
inexorably, and the accumulated LRW will be sitting right in our 
lap, in a decrepit vessel. Simple logic brings us back to the 
already advanced idea: While talks continue about the system 
construction and passions are raging around LRW, we need to dump 
this waste into the sea, as was done before the 1993 ban. 
  As practice and the latest research by specialists show, the 
low-activity waste accumulated at the Zvezda plant will have 
practically no effect on the ecology of the ocean, whose water 
naturally contains metal salts carrying radioactive nuclides. 
This is one point. Another is that special areas for waste 
dumping are designated quite far from the shore, taking into 
account the current, which will quickly dissipate the waste, 
practically bringing its radioactivity to a minimum. LRW loses 
its negative qualities as ecologically dangerous when it mixes 
with the general background of the world ocean. All waste is 
stringently documented. And, third, expeditions monitored the 
situation at the site of waste dumping. Instrumentation showed 
an increased radioactivity of sea water for an hour to an hour 
and a half after the dumping. When the LRW dissolved, the water 
reacquired its natural background level. 
  If we calculate the damage to nature during tanker accidents 
resulting in oil spills, this damage is far more serious and 
dangerous than dumping the same quantity of LRW into the water. 
  As to construction of a system of waste reprocessing, it 
cannot be built in Bolshoy Kamen, which is a densely populated 
area. This is the opinion of most Bolshoy Kamen residents; they 
do not object--and neither do specialists for that matter--to 
using the unfinished complex for LRW storage and processing in 
Sysoyev Bay. Enormous money was pumped into this complex back in 
the 1960's, but, as is quite common, it was never finished. It 
is up to specialists to say what should be done: a new one built 
or the already existing one put into operation. 
  We would like to see us take an united stand in the 
resolution of these problems instead of throwing words against 
one another at popular referendums and in the press. Today, both 
in the kray and in Russia, we cannot be divided into ours and 
strangers. The LRW problem is our common problem, our common 
trouble.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Mikhaylov, VLADIVOSTOK: "Most Maritime </F>
Kray Residents Live Below or Near Poverty Level"] 
  [Text] During this difficult time of transition to 
the market, kray statistical administration specialists are 
surveying 550 Maritime Kray families on a monthly basis. The 
social snapshot provided by this is quite sufficient to arrive 
at certain conclusions regarding the current life of the 
"average" Maritime Kray resident. 
  The latest survey showed that as of 1 April monetary income 
per family member has increased somewhat and amounts to 120,420 
rubles [R]. Of this amount, 40 percent goes for food, and this 
expense continues to grow. 
  Prices grew at a slower rate in March and even fell with 
respect to some products; this to a certain extent increased 
their consumption in some families. For instance, consumption of 
meat and meat products increased by 200 g, milk--by 700 g, and 
eggs--by three eggs. At the same time, consumption of fish and 
fish products declined because of higher prices. 
  The statistics also registered that of the 12 groups of 
monitored basic foodstuffs, only potato consumption remains at 
the rational norm level (8.8 kg a month per person). As to meat 
and milk products, fish, vegetables and fruit, their consumption 
lags below the norm by a factor of 1.5 to three. 
  The cost of the physiological maintenance minimum in March 
amounted to R96,149; 38 percent of kray residents have income 
below this level. Among them are first and foremost pensioners, 
whose average monthly pension amounted to only R43,000. 
  Differentiation of the population by level of income and 
material situation may be seen from the table.

  As we can see, there is considerable stratification of the 
kray population by income level. It should be noted that if the 
"poverty line" is defined as R96,000 and 38 percent of the kray 
population are below it, we can hardly call the situation of 
those with an income between R96,000 and R200,000 enviable. And 
such people account for 47 percent of the kray population. We 
should not assume, however, that the number of wealthy people 
with an income of R400,000 in the kray is precisely as the table 
shows. This is only the official data. In reality, there are 
many more rich people in the kray, but they do not particularly 
wish to advertise their income.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of Maritime Kray </F>
Administration, by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Vladimir Oshchenko; 
place and date not given: "Yevgeniy Nazdratenko: I Defend the 
Interests of the State and Maritime Kray"] 
  [Text] Head of the Maritime Kray Administration 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko spent 11 days in April outside the 
territory entrusted to him. He was in Seoul--the capital of 
South Korea--for a day, and then without a stopover in 
Vladivostok flew to another capital--Moscow, where he 
participated in the work of the supreme legislative chamber of 
the Russian parliament--the Federation Council. 
  Immediately on his return from this long trip, Yevgeniy 
Nazdratenko met with our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent. 
  [Oshchenko] You have emphasized many times that you select 
your foreign travel priorities in such a way as to avoid places 
where the Maritime Kray governor is invited mainly for 
representation. In other words, you go abroad only when there is 
an opportunity to solve some of the kray's problems with the 
help of foreign states or companies. What prompted you to go to 
Seoul? 
  [Nazdratenko] Seoul was the site of the third annual joint 
conference of the Committee for Cooperation Between the Russian 
Far East and Siberia and the Republic of Korea and the 
Association for Cooperation Between the Republic of Korea and 
the Russian Far East and Siberia. I was invited as a chairman 
for the Russian side. Heads of administrations of practically 
all Siberian and Far Eastern territories, including ethnic 
entities, also participated in the conference. 
  This conference was conducted on a very representative 
level; 
in essence, its task was to prepare Russian-South Korean 
economic projects, which will be discussed during the upcoming 
visit of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam to Moscow. Among 
the conference participants were the ministers of the most 
important ministries of South Korea--foreign affairs, labor, and 
industry. 
  As the association's chairman from the Russian side, I 
delivered an extensive report. I will be honest--I did not write 
it myself, but specialists from the Maritime Kray 
administration's foreign economic services did a very 
professional job, and the report did not have even a hint of 
overstressing the special role of Maritime Kray. Although one 
has to admit the simple truth that today the Maritime Kray 
population, counting the military, numerically exceeds the 
population of Khabarovsk Kray, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Magadan 
Oblast taken together. 
  Unfortunately, local interests were brought up at the 
meeting 
in Seoul, in particular, by Vladimir Saganov, chairman of the 
Republic of Buryatia's Council of Ministers, who announced the 
intention to conduct separate negotiations and sign separate 
agreements. I was compelled to remind all Russian participants 
of the conference in Seoul that there is one single Russian 
Federation, which has one president--Boris Yeltsin. And that 
agreements may be signed either with the president of Russia, or 
with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Not with a chairman of 
the Buryat council of ministers or a Maritime Kray governor... 
  Of course, South Korea continues very active cooperation 
with 
Russia, despite the fact that foreign investment in our country 
is hampered by the existing imbalance between political, 
economic, and legal relations. Recall for instance the 
Hende-Svetlaya [as transliterated] company, and the 22-story 
South Korean business center currently under construction in the 
center of Vladivostok... These are concrete contributions to our 
economy. 
  I hope that the meetings in Seoul and the work of our 
foreign 
economic relations specialists will allow us to expand this work 
with South Korean companies. First and foremost in the direction 
where Maritime Kray has the worst bottleneck: I mean, of course, 
power generation. For us, freight rates turn coal from other 
regions of Russia into gold. If we continue bringing coal from 
the outside, in the winter of 1994-95 a kilowatt-hour of 
electric power will cost 270 rubles [R]; this winter, which was 
very hard for industry, a kilowatt cost R40. Therefore, in 
searching for a solution we decided to open work on several coal 
deposits on kray territory. The idea is simple, although this 
is, of course, an emergency program: to strip open before winter 
several coal deposits--where stripping is about 2-4 meters. It 
would be good to get several Korean companies involved in 
construction of these strip mines. Although we do have a problem 
with respect to payment: The Koreans would like to get this coal 
as payment in kind, but we desperately need it ourselves. Still, 
I sensed that the Korean side is showing interest in working in 
Maritime Kray. 
  Perhaps rich Maritime Kray companies can join this 
project--those that already have began to invest money in the 
kray economy, such as for instance AKFES (Mikhail Dalman) or 
Roliz (Sergey Darkin). They are building, and we are very 
grateful to them... 
  [Oshchenko] What happened during your trip to Moscow? 
  [Nazdratenko] I took part in the work of the Federation 
Council. Unfortunately, this work did not produce a lot of 
results. The Federation Council accomplished only one concrete 
thing: It accepted the budget message for the second quarter. 
Although the budget has some shortcomings, the main one being 
that the money does not get to the territories, it has good 
figures built into it. At the same time, we have to acknowledge 
that this is an interim document. 
  Otherwise, the Federation Council got bogged down in a 
boring 
politicized intrigue, and this is very disappointing. The 
incident with the firing and resignation of General Procurator 
Kazannik is nothing more than the desire of the anti-president 
opposition to look for any pretext to hit Yeltsin. I was among 
those 68 deputies who voted for Kazannik's resignation; 74 voted 
against it. I said at the Federation Council that if the general 
procurator had read the Russian Constitution, he should know 
that it is the Federation Council that relieves him from the 
job. Why then did he write his resignation letter to the 
president and then disappear in Tomsk for a month and a half? 
Anybody who does not show up for work for a month and a half 
should be fired for absenteeism... 
  The Federation Council spent two days discussing the problem 
of crime and its suppression, but did not adopt any real 
decisions. 
  [Oshchenko] I assume that you certainly had some official 
meetings in Moscow on the subject of the situation with liquid 
radioactive waste storage in Bolshoy Kamen. Were you able to 
resolve anything? 
  [Nazdratenko] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of Ecology of the Russian Federation have prepared a 
document stating that dumping from the tanker cannot be done 
without the government's consent. Meanwhile, the tanker with 
liquid radioactive waste [LRW] may simply burst without asking 
permission from the government and Nazdratenko. I met with 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, and our positions on this 
matter are close: The money (whether from the Russian government 
or Japan, if the latter decides to help us) for LRW utilization 
must be used in Maritime Kray--not by some firm in Moscow which 
for some reason will solve our problems better than we can 
ourselves. I also met with Japan's ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary in Moscow, and during this meeting emphasized 
once again the kray administration's extreme concern at the 
situation with tankers and our desire to quickly and safely 
resolve this problem--preferably with the participation of 
Japanese companies, which have already developed effective 
methods. We could solve this problem in 20 days, were it not for 
all these diplomatic games. The Japanese ambassador also told me 
that if his government does decide to allocate money, it will be 
only on the condition that the money goes to Maritime Kray. 
  [Oshchenko] Recently rumors started spreading in Vladivostok 
that your lengthy trips to Moscow are not accidental and very 
soon you will leave "our city" with a promotion. Rumor has it 
that some government bulletin published a list of members of the 
future government, where you are listed as the minister of 
industry... 
  [Nazdratenko] I am not going anywhere. This is what 
happened. 
PRAVITELSTVENNYY VESTNIK magazine published a preliminary list 
of members of the government, and my name was listed as one of 
the candidates. I talked to both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and 
told them that I am not going anywhere. I have made a promise to 
work in Maritime Kray (for better or for worse is for the people 
to decide)... 
  [Oshchenko] And you cannot be tempted by any job whatsoever? 
  [Nazdratenko] No... I love Maritime Kray so much, and it is 
so important to make life better here that a bureaucratic career 
is not for me. I also want very much to remind kray residents: 
At the kray soviet session in May 1993 I told the deputies that 
for two more years we will retreat and move backwards under the 
pressure of crisis and ruin. At what speed is another 
question... We have not yet left the crisis behind us, and I 
simply cannot in clear conscience abandon Maritime Kray for 
Moscow high offices.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Korytko, VLADIVOSTOK: "It Will Now Be </F>
Necessary To Pay as Much for Energy as It Costs"] 
  [Text] As the press service of the Kray 
Administration reports, the government is preparing a draft 
decree in keeping with which a subsidy in the amount of 30 
billion rubles [R] will be allocated out of the federal budget 
to the Maritime area (specifically, the Dalenergo Joint-Stock 
Company), apparently for the last time, in order to cover the 
difference between preferential electricity rates and the actual 
producer cost. 
  Implementation of this measure will make it possible for the 
power industry of the Maritime area to purchase some of the fuel 
and, most importantly, embark on repairing power equipment which 
is extremely (70 percent) worn out. 
  However, as Deputy Head of the Kray Administration Sergey 
Demin, who "pushed through" this government document in Moscow, 
stressed, the Maritime area will not receive such subsidies any 
longer. Point 1 of Government Decree No. 1001, in keeping with 
which payments for electricity at the level of R40 per kw-hour 
were established, was pronounced void by a directive of Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. As Sergey Demin said, the 
government categorically demanded that the kray switch to actual 
rates for heat and electric energy. This applies to both 
industrial and household consumers of energy. 
  At the same time, it may be expected that the abandonment of 
the use of preferential rates may as early as April and May 
bring about a further crisis of insolvency in the kray because 
new debts will "pile up" on top of old ones, and a certain 
proportion of enterprises will actually go bankrupt, with all 
the ensuing consequences.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Kutenkikh, VLADIVOSTOK: "Miners in Artem </F>
Go on Strike"] 
  [Text] On 13 April employees of the Artemugol 
Enterprise began a strike of indefinite duration. 
  The situation of coal industry workers is critical. The 
people have not been paid for January, February, and March, and 
the money for December has not been paid either to 15 percent of 
workers. There is nothing with which to buy foodstuffs or 
clothing, nothing with which to pay for housing and day care 
centers (in some day care centers they are already turning 
children away). 
  According to Boris Lesovskiy, deputy general director of the 
Primorskugol Production Association, the debt to the association 
comes to 62.162 million rubles [R]. The government of the 
country is not keeping its end of the rate agreement. At present 
the cost of solid fuel in the Maritime area is the lowest in the 
country; its price has stayed at the level of the beginning of 
1993. Moscow must cover the difference, but it is not doing 
this. Even now, the debt comes to R26 billion. Money is not 
being allocated for current expenditures. Arrears for the 
development of production and razing dilapidated housing already 
come to R20.5 billion (miners still live in huts, but funds to 
build new housing are simply not available). The list could be 
continued. 
  It has been learned from unofficial sources that Moscow 
began 
to transfer money towards its arrears the day before yesterday. 
However, it was too late. Miners from Artem had stopped working. 
Yesterday they discussed the possibility of expressing their 
lack of confidence in the government and its prime minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Berres and Aleksandr Maltsev, under </F>
rubric "The Case of the Vladivostok Mayor": "No Accusation Has 
Been Leveled at the Administration Head"] 
  [Text] In Vladivostok the scandal is still raging 
around the figure of the city's mayor, Viktor Cherepkov (on 18 
March KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote about the mayor's ejection from the 
city administration building). Yesterday in the city's Leninskiy 
Court there occurred the latest session in the suit brought by 
Vice-Mayor Vladimir Gilgenberg, who contested the appointment of 
a kray administration employee as the acting mayor. Meanwhile 
eight local journalists who had spoken out in the mayor's 
defense requested the United States consulate to grant them 
political asylum, since they "feared for their life." 
  As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already written, the scandal began 
with the procurator's office initiating a criminal case based on 
instances in which employees of the Vladivostok mayor's office 
had received bribes, although the fact of the bribes themselves 
is confirmed only by a certain person offering the bribes, who 
is named Volkov. Mr. Cherepkov's lawyer, Semen Ulitskiy, 
reported to a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the kray 
administration's reports to the effect that an accusation had 
been made against the mayor are false, and, consequently, the 
procurator's office's decree concerning the mayor's removal from 
his position is illegal. 
  Meanwhile, according to the lawyer, associates of Mr. 
Cherepkov are currently being barred from entering the city 
administration building. These include, for example, Vladimir 
Gilgenberg, the acting mayor during the latter's illness. 
Gilgenberg himself feels that this is the consequence of his 
dismissal by order of the acting administration head of 
Primorskiy Kray, Igor Lebedinets, who was contested by the 
vice-mayor in Vladivostok's Frunzenskiy Rayon Court. But so far 
the documents concerning who specifically had dismissed Mr. 
Gilgenberg have not been presented to the court, and therefore 
the case is dragging out. The vice-mayor also protested in the 
Leninskiy Rayon People's Court Lebedinets' order concerning the 
appointment of kray administration employee Konstantin 
Tolstoshein as acting mayor of the city. Yesterday there was no 
court session -- this time the judge was ill. 
  Viktor Cherepkov himself has his own opinion about the 
reasons for the scandal, and he expressed that opinion in an 
interview with a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. According to 
him, even as early as the mayoral election he was threatened, 
and told to withdrawn his candidacy. But when he nevertheless 
became mayor, "dual authority formed" in the city. On one side 
was the "Pakt" [Pact] grouping of Primorskiy Kray 
industrialists, who occupied key positions in the kray 
administration, and on the other side were the "democrats," 
headed by the mayor. Mr. Cherepkov feels that "Pakt" monopolized 
the sale of the output produced by the Primorskiy Kray 
industrial enterprises, which sell their output cheaply to 
"Pakt," which then resells it at substantially higher prices. 
The mayor asserts that he began openly to oppose this, and that 
resulted in the present criminal case. As long ago as late 1993, 
certain people "began replacing" him with Mr. Volkov (who has 
accused the mayor of taking bribes). The mayor was warned that 
he should avoid Volkov, and he met with him in the presence of 
witnesses, with the conversation being recorded by a video 
camera. 
  Mr. Cherepkov also reported that the local journalists who 
had spoken out in his defense are currently experiencing a large 
amount of pressure on the part of unknown individuals -- for 
example, Sergey Shakolenko, editor in chief of PRIMORYE 
newspaper, was beaten up in the street. Therefore Mr. 
Shakolenko, as well as Anatoliy Lelyakin, editor in chief of 
BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK newspaper; Pavel Kiyevskiy, chief of the 
Vladivostok administration's television center; Vadim Karyagin, 
director of the Vladivostok administration's television studio; 
and four more journalists had asked the United States consulate 
to grant them political asylum.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladivostok City Center for Disease Control: </F>
"Number of Infected Persons Increases"] 
  [Text] The incidence of disease in Vladivostok not 
only is not going down--it is rising. For instance, the 
incidence of diphtheria in 1993 as compared to 1992 increased 
17-fold, measles--48-fold, and whooping cough--fourfold. 
  This situation has been caused by unjustifiably broad 
contraindications against vaccination and underestimation of the 
importance of the latter by city residents. 
  The vaccines we use meet international standards and cause 
fewer side effects than foreign analogues. There are currently 
practically no contraindications against the use of preventive 
vaccination. Even if a child or an adult suffers from some 
chronic disease, including an allergy, vaccination can be done 
after consulting a specialist and a preparatory medication 
therapy. 
  Analysis of the spread of infections that can be controlled 
by preventive vaccination (diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, 
polio, tetanus) show the effectiveness of vaccination. It is not 
accidental that the Russian Federation law on the hygiene and 
disease control welfare makes vaccination against these 
infectious diseases mandatory. 
  In the event vaccination is rejected even on an individual 
basis, collective immunity is not created and the danger of 
infectious disease is actually the greatest for those ill 
children and adults who are temporarily exempt from vaccination. 
Therefore, besides responsibility for one's own health, each 
person also has an obligation with respect to the health of the 
people around him. 
  Only preventive vaccination can stop the rise of infections 
transmitted through the respiratory channel. Vaccinations are 
given free of charge in all city polyclinics.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of State </F>
Duma committee, by Karl Rendel; place and date not given: 
"Deputies Will Have Things To Work On"] 
  [Text] On 18 March the president issued an edict 
suspending a decree of the oblast government on holding a 
referendum on the draft Statute of Leningrad Oblast on 20 March, 
thus dispensing with the plans of the oblast leadership, which 
had counted on approving its own "minor constitution" before the 
formation of the representative authorities. The failure of the 
decree to comply with Article 66 (Point 2) of the Federal 
Constitution, according to which a statute may only be approved 
by a legislative assembly, was grounds for taking this step. 
  As is known, the oblast government tried to collect certain 
dividends. On 20 March a poll of the population on the draft 
statute was held. Although not legally binding, it made it 
possible for the government to enlist the support of residents 
of the oblast. A majority of the electorate--54 
percent--approved the draft. 
  How does this document square with the reform of local 
self-government? Our correspondent put that question to Anatoliy 
Sliva, chairman of a State Duma committee: 
  "Thank God, the draft statute was not put up to a 
referendum, 
after all! In the greater scheme of things they do not have 
local self-government there at all. I believe that it is better 
to wait but to adopt such oblast laws as it actually needs. 
  "The reform of local self-government should be implemented 
with regard to each city and inhabited locality. This is an 
all-Russian problem. First of all, reform of the budgetary 
system of the Russian Federation and a clear-cut separation of 
financial sources at all levels should be at issue. All cities 
should know ahead of time what funds they have at their 
disposal, and build their social policies around this. 
  "Municipal property has yet to be generated. This problem 
has 
not yet been solved at this point. Ownership has not been 
codified by the relevant acts; property is being stolen. 
Privatization of municipal property frequently proceeds under 
programs confirmed in Moscow. This cannot be done. Programs 
should be regional or, better yet, local. 
  "As far as the structures of local self-government go, the 
population is their object. However, the mechanism of local 
referendums has not been set in motion yet. We must definitely 
come to this. I think that the future statutes of cities should 
be ratified by the entire population after relevant preparation 
and discussion. 
  "At present, the issue of a representative organ of local 
self-government is very acute. If there is no such organ, what 
discussion of local authorities can there be?! The number of 
deputies, representatives, or municipal counselors (call them 
what you please!) is not the point. That the population is tired 
and does not see a perspective is not the only reason for which 
the people do not turn out for elections at present. They do not 
believe that the representative organ will have a regular budget 
of its own."

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Statsenko: "What Did Sobchak Mean?"] </F>
  [Text] Appearing on TV on 29 March, Mayor of St. 
Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak announced that the law enforcement 
organs, with support from the military, would shortly mount an 
extensive offensive against the criminal underworld. What did 
our mayor mean? 
  In the words of GUVD [Main Directorate of Internal Affairs] 
Chief Arkadiy Kramarev, it is indeed planned to conduct a 
special operation similar to "Signal-2" this spring (the 
beginning date of the operation has already been determined, but 
it is an official secret). The internal troops of the 
Northwestern District of the Internal Troops of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs and assets of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia will be used in the 
operation. The chief of the Main Directorate did not know 
whether Sobchak meant this operation when he declared a war on 
organized crime. 
  The staff of Lieutenant General Leonid Chervotkin, commander 
of the Northwestern District of the Internal Troops of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs, explained to 
our correspondent that the Internal Troops have always provided 
support for the militia in combating violations of law, and will 
do so in the future. However, they have nothing to do with the 
army because they belong to the organization of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. In the opinion of the commander's adjutant, 
the mayor's words on "support from the military" most likely 
refer to the army. They could not give us an intelligible answer 
at the Leningrad Military District, either. Nonetheless, it came 
out in a conversation with Vladimir Balonkin, chief of the press 
center of the Leningrad Military District, that our military 
district does not intend to assign any military units to combat 
crime because the tasks of the military are different.

You at the Elections on 3 April. A Round Without Winners"] 
  [Text] The city electoral commission is continuing to 
verify the results of the elections. Chairman of the Electoral 
Commission Vladimir Fomichev stated yesterday that, as of 
yesterday, the elections might be considered validly held in 
only 25 districts, with a winner not being revealed in any one 
of them. Voting is to be held yet again on 3 April 
everywhere. 
  Democratic Unity was the most successful among public 
associations that took part in the campaign: All of its 
candidates qualified for the second round. All of St. Petersburg 
managed to qualify six candidates, the City We Love--two 
candidates each [as published], and Business St. Petersburg and 
the Motherland--one each. Another 15 participants in the second 
round were nominated by the voters in their districts. 
  The city commission is continuing to review petitions 
concerning violations. However, observed Fomichev, even if the 
case of propaganda on election day is proven, it is not clear 
what sanctions can be used. The commission is not entitled to 
bump a candidate out of the competition; meanwhile, ruling the 
elections invalid would result in punishing not only the 
violator but also his competitor. 
  Meanwhile, the future of the new representative organ of 
power in the city remains uncertain. According to the 
regulations, the first meeting of the City Assembly should be 
held no later than the 30th day after the elections. However, it 
is already clear that the City Assembly will have legal 
incapacity until the repeat elections are held (the date has not 
been determined yet). No fewer than one-half of the established 
number of the elected representatives of the people should be 
present even in order for a meeting to have the right to make 
decisions. Besides, many fundamental decisions (this is 
particularly the case with mutual relations with executive 
power) may only be passed by the assembly by two-thirds of the 
votes. Vladimir Fomichev refused to comment on this situation. 
He stressed that the directive of the mayor to extend voting was 
addressed directly to precinct electoral commissions, whereas 
the city commission restricted itself to establishing procedures 
for sealing ballot boxes. When journalists inquired whether this 
means that precinct commissions report to the mayor, Fomichev 
merely shrugged his shoulders: "You are asking strange 
questions." 
  To this day the legitimacy of the mayor's decision to extend 
the elections by one day has not been determined. As is known, 
on Monday the procuracy lodged a protest with the mayor's office 
which points out that the length of voting is established by 
Article 33 of the Basic Regulations on Elections to the 
Representative Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation 
Components, which were confirmed by an edict of the president on 
27 October of last year, and cannot be changed. 
  Yesterday, Anatoliy Sobchak signed a response to the protest 
of the procuracy. In the response he rejected the complaints. 
The response reads: "An organ that has issued a regulatory act 
is entitled to amend it." In the opinion of the mayor, Article 
33 of the Basic Regulations imposed a ban on changing the length 
of elections for district electoral commissions, but not for the 
organ which has issued election regulations. Besides, the mayor 
recalled that the Basic Regulations are advisory in nature. 
  The procuracy refused to comment on Anatoliy Sobchak's 
response, referring to the fact that this document has not been 
received through official channels yet. In any case, under 
legislation in effect the procurator is left with just two 
possible alternatives for action: accept the arguments of the 
mayor's office or forward the protest to the courts. 
  What is to be done? Representatives of seven electoral 
associations tried to answer this question yesterday. Igor 
Artemyev (the City We Love) and Aleksandr Belyayev (Democratic 
Unity) informed their colleagues about a conference held at the 
mayoralty. Anatoliy Sobchak expects to conduct a second round in 
the fall in the belief that the Goodwill Games will improve the 
mood of the citizens. In his opinion, the elected deputies 
should focus on working with the voters. 
  A majority of those in attendance proceeded from the need to 
acknowledge that the elections were not validly held in all 
districts because the extension of the elections made them 
illegal. 
  Aleksandr Belyayev voiced a different point of view. 
According to him, Anatoliy Sobchak was entitled to change the 
voting schedule. 
  An agreement in principle on forming councils of electoral 
associations was reached at the meeting. The issue of the future 
of executive power is up in the air. The Motherland and Great 
Russia insist on restoring the powers of the old city soviet. 
Our City--Our Home proposed to create an organ which is new in 
principle for the duration of the transition period--the public 
chamber of St. Petersburg. A law on such chambers could be 
passed by the State Duma. 
  On Friday the State Duma will consider the issue of the 
elections in St. Petersburg. Sobchak has already stated that he 
will challenge any decision of the parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Kudrin, first deputy chairman of the </F>
Government of St. Petersburg, by Dmitriy Travin; place and date 
not given: "`The City Will Become More Manageable'"] 
  [Text] The creation of the Government of St. Petersburg 
cannot be considered a surprise. Such a reorganization of the 
mayoralty had been planned for a long time. However, until the 
very last moment there had been no precise concept of this new 
organ. It had not been clear whether the government was to be 
created to emulate Moscow, or to enhance the status of city 
leaders, or to carry out a truly important reform of the 
management. 
  To a degree the situation has become clearer now. The system 
of city management has indeed been reorganized, affecting the 
financial and economic block to the greatest degree. The united 
Economy and Finance Committee (KEF) is being created out of two 
old committees of the mayoralty. The committee will be headed by 
Aleksey Kudrin, who has been appointed first deputy chairman of 
the Government of St. Petersburg. 
  Kudrin is 33. He graduated from St. Petersburg University; 
he 
is a candidate of economic sciences. In 1990 he made a change 
from a scientific to an administrative career by creating, 
together with Anatoliy Chubays, the Economic Reform Committee of 
the Leningrad City Executive Committee. After the mayoralty of 
St. Petersburg was established, Kudrin worked first as deputy 
chairman of the Economic Development Committee (KER), and 
subsequently as chairman of the Finance Committee. 
  Today Aleksey Kudrin shares with readers of NEVSKOYE VREMYA 
his reflections on the role an organ such as the government can 
play in the life of St. Petersburg. 
  [Travin] Aleksey Leonidovich, why does St. Petersburg need a 
government, after all? Is this a fad or a reflection of changes 
that are now taking place in the country? 
  [Kudrin] Of course, this is associated with changes. The new 
Constitution has substantially enhanced the rights of components 
of the Federation, of which St. Petersburg is one. The 
enhancement of rights goes beyond mere words. Following 
ratification of the Constitution, absolutely specific regulatory 
documents appeared which created a new working environment for 
us. On one hand, the city authorities will now have to hustle 
much more in order to make ends meet. On the other hand, they 
have been given new rights to ensure the regular course of life. 
  [Travin] The rights of regions have been growing in our 
country for a long time, since as early as when Yeltsin was 
travelling throughout the country and saying (under the 
functionary Gorbachev): "Take as many rights as you can." 
However, until recently the real potential of the regions was 
determined by their clout in the lobby of the minister of 
finance. 
  [Kudrin] Precisely--"until recently." Perhaps not everyone 
in 
St. Petersburg knows that effective this year, the minister of 
finance "put a large lock on his door." At present, the amount 
of funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance to support a 
certain region (ours, in particular) is determined by strictly 
objective criteria. We will not succeed in "shaking anything 
loose." Therefore, we must procure all possible funds ourselves 
in order for the city to be able to live. 
  Previously the head of the administration could say that he 
was responsible for these facilities, and the federal organs of 
power--for those facilities. Now he should essentially be 
accountable for everything. For example, in St. Petersburg the 
largest museums which are the most valuable to us, such as the 
Hermitage and the Kunstkammer, should technically be financed 
out of the funds of the entire country. However, last year they 
had it worse than the facilities financed by the city because 
the Government of Russia was clearly not providing enough money. 
We could not allow this situation to occur and helped out the 
leading museums. If the Hermitage sustains any damage, it will 
make no sense to shift the blame to Moscow. At present, we have 
no other way out but to assume complete responsibility for the 
life of St. Petersburg. However, we are demanding greater powers 
since the responsibilities of the city authorities are greater, 
and we are already getting such powers. 
  [Travin] Can you distinguish specific questions in resolving 
which St. Petersburg is becoming more independent? 
  [Kudrin] First, all decisions of the federal authorities 
associated with increases in expenditures from local budgets are 
now nonbinding. I would like to invite the attention of the 
citizens of St. Petersburg to the fact that no matter how 
generous the edicts and decrees are that are issued in Moscow, 
we will have to come up with the funds to implement them 
ourselves. For example, the recent decision to extend the war 
veterans' preferences to the survivors of the blockade was not 
backed up by a single kopek from the federal authorities. 
  The survivors of the blockade are sacred to us; we did 
allocate funds for the implementation of this decree. However, 
in general we will now have to determine ourselves in each case 
whether a particular measure can be financed. 
  Second, now we can introduce new taxes and fees ourselves 
and 
reduce or increase, up to a certain limit, the rate of profit 
tax. The city authorities will now have to decide how to find 
the optimal form of taxation so as, on one hand, not to do in 
the economy of the city by high requisitions while, on the other 
hand, not leaving sectors financed from the budget without 
funding. We have made a difficult decision today--to support 
entrepreneurship and to not increase the overall burden of taxes. 
  Third, components of the Federation have now been granted, 
for the first time, the right to sign intergovernment agreements 
in their own name. We can establish direct contacts with any 
foreign state in order to solve problems facing the city. 
  [Travin] The formation of the KEF instead of two committees 
represents the greatest structural change in the government of 
St. Petersburg (compared to the structure of the mayoralty). 
Such an organ as the KER has actually been liquidated. 
Meanwhile, it was always a key organ within the structure of 
city management. Are the transformations associated with 
objective changes in economic processes or with a personnel 
reshuffle? 
  [Kudrin] Generally, the merging of the two committees is not 
surprising at all. Please note that as soon as reforms began in 
Russia, the issue of merging the Ministry of the Economy and the 
Ministry of Finance at the federal level was raised. Gaydar's 
first government title in 1991 was "deputy prime minister, 
minister of the economy and finance." So, the reformers 
immediately raised the issue of coordinating efforts in these 
two most significant areas. To be sure, coordination 
subsequently petered out as the position of radical reformers in 
the Government of Russia weakened. 
  [Travin] Why is close coordination in the areas of the 
economy and finance so important right now? 
  [Kudrin] Let us recall what the work of the Planning 
Commission of the Leningrad City Executive Committee, 
subsequently transformed into the KER of the mayoralty, was all 
about. It collected and collated the plans of individual 
enterprises and regions. It was an element of an administrative 
management system. The collected data were submitted to the CPSU 
Central Committee and the government. 
  The industrial enterprises of the city have now become 
independent, and for the most part even privatized. The 
Government of St. Petersburg does not engage in managing 
industry. However, the methods of work of the KER have, 
unfortunately, changed little. What need is there to keep an 
organ operating under a scenario that is at least three years 
old? 
  In turn, the functions of the Finance Committee have grown 
sharply because in a market economy money plays an incomparably 
greater role than in the environment of the administrative 
management system. We should take into account changing economic 
conditions, inflation, the possible decline in the volume of 
production, the intake of conversion credit, the influx of 
foreign capital, as well as quite a number of other factors. The 
city just will not survive in the absence of a thorough 
analytical effort in this area. 
  [Travin] Do the city authorities really have to know the 
projected state of affairs at the Kirovskiy or Izhorskiy Plants? 
After all, the authorities do not manage their operations. Would 
it not be sufficient to analyze the state of affairs at 
municipal facilities, public transit, health care, and culture, 
that is, the areas for which the government of St. Petersburg is 
directly responsible? 
  [Kudrin] If we do not project the situation at the Kirov 
Plant, we will not be able to evaluate the volume of tax 
revenues taken in by the city treasury, to plan our 
expenditures, and therefore to maintain our municipal 
facilities, transportation, health care, and culture in a 
regular manner. The Finance Committee has been really interested 
in projections, whereas the KER has so far lacked a precise 
notion of who it was preparing projections for: either still for 
a report to the CPSU Central Committee (in which case old 
methods are needed) or for drawing up the city budget (in which 
case new methods are needed). A real opportunity to restructure 
the operation of organs involved in making projections has now 
appeared. 
  The system of mutual relations with investors who invest 
money in our city is also changing. They no longer come to the 
KER for permits to open branches or build plants. Enterprises 
plan all of this themselves. However, they do come to the 
Finance Committee to ask for tax relief, deferments, and loans. 
We must analyze the proposals made from the standpoint of their 
significance for the city, the probability of credit repayment, 
and so on. From this point of view, work on projections should 
also be subordinated to financial tasks. 
  The reform of the system of city management on the whole and 
the restructuring of the financial and economic block in 
particular will help the authorities to better solve the 
problems of St. Petersburg. I hope that in the immediate future 
the citizens will feel that the city is becoming more manageable 
than before.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Statsenko and Ilyas Vasipov: "The </F>
`Signal' Came Through Loud and Clear"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's briefing at the GUVD [Main 
Directorate of Internal Affairs] was devoted to the results of 
the two-week-long active and preventive operation 
"Signal-2." 
  According to Arkadiy Kramarev, chief of the St. Petersburg 
GUVD, the operation produced quite good results. Militiamen 
worked 12-hour shifts; about 9,000 people participated in 
operational and preventive efforts daily. Not only militiamen 
but also soldiers in compulsory military service and militia 
functionaries from Murmansk, Vladimir, Kaliningrad, Kirov, 
Pskov, Smolensk and other oblasts took part in the effort. The 
operation was controlled directly by the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] of Russia. 
  In the course of "Signal-2," 4,907 inspections of hotels, 
dormitories, and other facilities for the temporary residence of 
citizens were effected; 7,190 locations for the storage and sale 
of material valuables were checked out, along with 1,164 
facilities of the licensing system. 
  The results of "Signal-2," which lasted only two weeks, were 
two times greater than the statistics of militia activities in 
the previous month. Some 3,513 crimes were solved, including 43 
murders, 90 cases of grave bodily injury, 58 bandit assaults, 
282 robberies, and 213 cases of theft of motor vehicles and 
carjacking. 
  A total of 3,360 criminals were apprehended, of whom 1,815 
were "while the trail was hot." Some 292 crimes committed by 
criminal groups were uncovered. A total of 313 firearms and 681 
units of cutting and piercing weapons, 16 grenades, 48 stolen 
motor vehicles, about 48 kilograms of drugs, money and valuables 
totalling 718 million rubles, $29,000, and 110 tonnes of 
rare-earth metals were confiscated from criminals. 
  Lieutenant General Leonid Chervotkin, commander of the 
Northwestern District of the Internal Troops of the Russian 
Federation MVD, who was present at the briefing, assured those 
in attendance that St. Petersburg would be "cleansed" before the 
Goodwill Games. 
  Among other issues, journalists were interested in new 
information concerning the talk about the dismissal of Arkadiy 
Kramarev, which had not died down in two weeks. 
  Without starting a discussion, General Kramarev said: "There 
has not been an official document to this effect yet." 
  A briefing at the SZ UVDT [Northwestern Directorate of 
Internal Affairs for Transportation] was held on the same day. 
The results of the "Signal-2" operation were also announced 
there. 
  The leadership of the SZ UVDT is particularly concerned 
about 
the process of preparations for the Goodwill Games. The 
Organizational Committee of the games still has not familiarized 
the SZ UVDT with the schedule for the arrival and departure of 
the guests. 
  However, despite the difficulties the directorate is already 
developing a plan of measures for the period of the Goodwill 
Games. Thus, it is planned to set up 13 operational protection 
lines at railway terminals and airports effective July. Some 910 
people will be used to man them along the travelling route of 
the participants and guests of the Goodwill Games. 
  According to SZ UVDT Chief Viktor Vlasov, the average number 
of crimes committed on transportation conveyances has so far 
dropped by a factor of two.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of </F>
the president of the Russian Federation in the former Yugoslavia 
and deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia, by Yelena 
Shchedrunova; place and date not given: "Vitaliy Churkin: 
Negotiations Should Be Conducted Before, Not After, War Starts"] 
  [Text] The EC recognized Bosnia-Hercegovina's 
independence two years ago. This decision in fact provoked the 
war that is still lacerating this Balkan republic. SEGODNYA 
offers on this topic an interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special 
representative of the president of the Russian Federation in the 
former Yugoslavia and deputy minister of foreign affairs of 
Russia, who returned from Zagreb the day before yesterday with a 
new diplomatic victory: With his direct assistance the 
leadership of Croatia and the leaders of the Serbs of Krajina 
reached agreement on an end to armed operations. 
  [Shchedrunova] What, for all that, was the cause of the war 
in Bosnia, in your opinion? 
  [Churkin] There was a historical structure going by the name 
of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which, by 
virtue of certain political conditions, lasted for several 
decades. Then, when, in 1980, Tito died, it gradually began to 
weaken, and many experts began to express fears that it would 
collapse. This in fact happened. At the time of the 
disintegration of the Socialist Federative Republic of 
Yugoslavia the most vulnerable spot was Bosnia-Hercegovina, 
where three national groups with complex historical relations 
were most closely intermingled. And they were unable at this 
difficult time to achieve political solutions that would have 
made it possible to avoid war. The fact that the international 
community moved in haste to recognize, specifically, 
Bosnia-Hercegovina did not, most likely, help either. This was 
done on the basis of the parties' preliminary accord on the plan 
of the Portuguese diplomat Cutellero. This plan, which was 
devised in March 1992, is reminiscent of the present proposal 
concerning the creation of a union of three states. After Bosnia 
had been recognized by the EC, a succession of other 
recognitions followed. The intention was very good--to support 
by the authority of the international community the new 
realities--but the result proved the opposite. The Muslims and 
Croats adopted a decision on independence without the consent of 
the Serbs. A war, which subsequently developed according to its 
own laws, began. It is not only soldiers who are fighting. 
Hostility has begun among the peaceful inhabitants also. 
  [Shchedrunova] One has the impression that the Serbs have, 
for all that, won this war. 
  [Churkin] Well, yes, certainly. There need be no doubt about 
this. This is their tragedy, to a certain extent. Because while 
they are asking why the international community is up in arms 
against them--they are capturing territory. They now control 72 
percent of the territory, although even by their estimates they 
are entitled to 64 percent. Yes, in the military plane they have 
proven more successful. As for the question of who the aggressor 
in this war is, I have from the very outset employed the 
following wording, which was recently repeated by President 
Clinton, incidentally: It is a civil war aggravated by outside 
interference. This also is understandable. These were, after 
all, internal borders. And here is the conclusion the 
international community needs to draw: Some realities in the 
world exist independently of borders. Particularly when these 
are borders within a mononational state. Borders are borders, 
and the peoples lived cross-wise, paying no attention to them. 
The border of the conflict did not coincide with the borders of 
the republic. A more involved preliminary political period of a 
search for solutions should have been negotiated, obviously, 
before the proclamation of independence by the Muslims and 
Croats and the world community's recognition of it. 
  [Shchedrunova] About the efforts of the world community. 
Following the London conference, which afforded some prospects, 
there has been a break in diplomatic work of many months. 
  [Churkin] This is, indeed, the case. It seems to me that a 
principal reason for such a protracted conflict was the fact 
that originally the format of the coordinating committee created 
by the London conference was insufficiently convincing for the 
parties. Because neither Russia nor the United States were 
sufficiently vigorously engaged in this format. The United 
Nations and the EC lacked, for all that, sufficient political 
weight. Generally, granted all the respect for the EC, a 
conclusion is that a serious crisis, even if it is purely 
European, cannot be resolved by the EC independently. The 
inclusion of heavy artillery in the shape of Russia and the 
United States was needed. But under no circumstances can all 
efforts be turned into a purely Russian-American operation. 
Everything should be done in an alliance with the EC. And we 
have now approached the most successful option here. It was 
actually this new format--Russia, the United States, and the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia, that is, the 
EC and the United Nations--which is at this stage the most 
effective, most likely--which emerged in Zagreb. Although not 
one guaranteeing rapid success. But I now have more of a feeling 
that the parties themselves have approached the fact that it is 
time to negotiate. 
  [Shchedrunova] As far as the relations of Russia and the 
United States on this question are concerned. One sometimes has 
the impression that certain actions of Russia have been inspired 
by actions of the United States, that is, that Russia has tried 
to keep pace with it, as it were. 
  [Churkin] I would not, to be honest, be opposed to such 
"socialist competition" with the Americans in respect to who 
would do more for a settlement of the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia, provided that we worked together, keeping one 
another informed. But as far as recent events (the signing of 
the agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim federation in 
Washington and the agreement on a cease-fire between the Croats 
and the Serbs in Krajina in the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb--Ye.Shch.) are concerned, this was pure coincidence. 
Before my last tour of the "towns and villages," which began on 
11 March, it never crossed my mind even that such a round of 
negotiations would be organized in the Russian Embassy. 
Everything was born in the course of conversations with Tudjman 
and Milosevic, which left the impression that the parties were 
really interested in finally signing an agreement. I jumped at 
this. 
  [Shchedrunova] Your opinion of the development of the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Churkin] There are three or four sore points, agreement on 
which having been reached, the problem of the borders of the new 
republics could be resolved. The most important point is 
Sarajevo, where the parties' positions are directly opposite. 
Whereas the Muslims are saying that Sarajevo "must be ours," the 
Serbs are declaring that they cannot conceive of any kind of 
agreement without part of Sarajevo. We see as a solution the 
preservation of the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and Sarajevo as the capital of this state. A capital consisting 
of two parts. The problem, true, will be how to reestablish 
normal life in the city in order that it not be divided. Despite 
the fact that politically it would belong to two parts of one 
and the same union. Specialists say that this is possible. But 
the division of territories is, of course, a complex issue, and 
rapid success is not to be expected here. As far as the plan for 
the entry of the new state formations on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into a confederation with other states is 
concerned, the proposal according to which the Croatian-Muslim 
federation would form a confederation with Croatia, and the 
Serbian Republic, with Serbia, would seem perfectly fair. That 
is, Bosnia-Herzegovina would not wholly become part of a 
confederation with anyone. The Croats are not objecting to this 
plan. 
  [Shchedrunova] But this would be unprecedented in world 
politics. 
  [Churkin] Yes, this is a unique plan, but perhaps it would 
pave the way toward the solution of other conflicts also. But 
this needs to be approached very cautiously, for we are talking 
no more, no less, after all, about one state entering into 
confederative relations with part of another state.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Zamyatin and Aleksandr Koretskiy: </F>
"`Kuntsevich Case' May Replace `Mirzayanov Case': United States 
on Russia's Possession of Biological Weapons"] 
  [Text] Yesterday THE WASHINGTON POST newspaper, 
quoting an anonymous source in the Clinton administration, said 
that Russia continues to develop biological warfare 
agents--despite Boris Yeltsin's assurances to the contrary and 
the fact that the then-USSR signed the 1972 Convention on 
Banning Biological Weapons. The United States, however, does not 
accuse Yeltsin personally. The Clinton administration believes 
that he is "not in the loop." 
  According to an anonymous source from Clinton's inner 
circles, the White House allegedly has "irrefutable proof that 
Russia has a biological warfare program." Specifically, 
according to the newspaper, the point is the existence in Russia 
of some "biological infrastructure of noncommercial purpose." 
According to the same anonymous source, information on the 
existence in Russia of a program to develop and produce 
biological weapons had been received from sources in the United 
States in Great Britain, including from a Russian scientist who 
immigrated to the United States last year. However, another 
anonymous source from the American White House, whose opinion 
THE WASHINGTON POST also quotes, believes that there is no proof 
to support such a sensational accusation. In his opinion, what 
may be meant here is the existence in Russia of "specialized 
equipment of nonmilitary purpose," which nevertheless ought to 
be dismantled along with the military one. 
  So far there is no reaction from Russia. It is interesting, 
however, that the scandalous newspaper item in the United States 
coincided with the resignation of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the 
chairman of the Committee on Convention-Related Problems of 
Chemical and Biological Weapons under the president of Russia. 
Lately he had been Russia's "chief chemist," and many varieties 
of second-generation toxic agents had been developed with his 
direct participation. His functions included the development of 
a chemical weapons destruction program and monitoring its 
implementation (Moscow had always denied that it had biological 
weapons but nevertheless had a committee on its "convention" on 
the grounds of ensuring compliance with the 1972 Convention). 
The reason for Kuntsevich's resignation, given yesterday at a 
briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov--"giving consent to 
transportation and storage of a serious consignment of toxic 
agents within the limits of a large city"--is questioned by 
everyone who is even minimally familiar with the chemical 
weapons problem. It is laughable to remove from the job a 
person, who in the past had sanctioned transportation and 
destruction of entire arsenals of toxic agents in densely 
population areas of the Volga region, just for giving consent to 
carry out only part of this program. 
  An interesting suggestion came from one of KOMMERSANT's 
competent sources, according to whom there is a connection 
between Russia being accused of continuing work on biological 
weapons and Mr. Kuntsevich's resignation (the assumption is that 
there has been a leak of certain information, which was the true 
reason for resignation). This assumption is indirectly supported 
by the fact that at the hearings in the former Supreme Soviet 
and in the State Duma Kuntsevich persistently understated the 
true size of Russia's combat toxic agents arsenal by a factor of 
seven or eight at a minimum (according to estimates by 
independent observers). 
  There is only one way, however, to counter Washington's 
accusations: The Yeltsin-Clinton joint statement, issued in 
Moscow in January, allows for the "possibility of mutual visits 
to facilities and holding meetings of experts in order to 
monitor compliance with the Convention on Banning Biological and 
Toxic Weapons."

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Chernobrov: "The Only One Sitting At the </F>
End of the Chain Was a Wise Tomcat: Today Nothing Can Restrain 
Scientists Who Are Rushing to the Transoceanic Lukomorye"] 
  [Text] "Relative to science in Russia: until the day I die, 
nothing will change there. And I'm never going back there 
again!' Those words ended the interview given to American and 
Russian newspapers by Academician Aleksey Abrikosov, the head of 
the theoretical group at the (Argoni) national laboratory in the 
United States, and the former head of the High Pressures 
Institute in the Moscow suburb of Troitsk. Of course, the job of 
heading a famous institute is much more prestigious than that of 
heading a small group consisting of 14 persons. But all this, in 
the scientist's opinion, is in the past. 
  What prestige can we be talking about if, during the last 
years before his emigration, the academician met with his 
renowned associates Roald Sagdeyev and Yakov Sinayev most 
frequently while waiting in line for groceries? Add to that the 
incomparable difference in the "equipment level" (expressed that 
way, in parentheses) between our own laboratories and the 
American laboratories with regard to computer technology, 
instruments, and materials, as well the tremendous difference 
(by a factor of many times) in the salaries, and you will get 
the answer to the question of "Why do these and other scientists 
now meet one another at conferences in German and American 
institutes?" Because the number of specialists from the 
Institute of Theoretical Physics imeni Landau and the Leningrad 
Physical Tekhnikum imeni Ioffe is so large that scientific 
arguments begin in English, but end up in Russian. One would 
scarcely expect a meeting like this to occur in any Texas 
supermarket... 
  As Mikhaylo Lomonosov said (incidentally, he too did 
probationary work abroad), if you lose something in one place, 
you will invariably gain something somewhere else. The largest 
"gain" occurred in Germany, Israel, and the United States: many 
personnel problems were also resolved at the expense of Russian 
scientists in Greece, Australia, Finland, and Canada. But it is 
one thing when our professors, like poor relatives, leave no 
stone unturned at various companies (in the United States 
approximately one-half of the Russian scientists do not have a 
permanent job). One can in this instance act a bit arrogantly 
and offer an academician the job of junior scientific associate. 
But it is a completely different thing when the same "oppressed 
and outraged" individual is invited to take a managerial chair 
somewhere in a "threshold" country (that is, a place where 
nuclear weapons are being developed). 
  Of course, the number of people who have set out for the 
"threshold" third countries is definitely not a million (the 
Americans were afraid of that number) or even a thousand: last 
year Iran "bought" approximately 50 specialists for $5000 a 
month to assemble nuclear warheads; Libya "bought" specialists 
from the Kurchatov Institute to work within the confines of one 
project near the Gulf of Sidra for $100,000; Algeria, Ukrainian 
specialists to develop a nuclear power plant... They barely 
managed to remove from an aircraft a group of engineers who were 
departing for North Korea to work in accordance with a 
contract... 
  According to evaluations given by the RAN [Russian Academy 
of 
Sciences] Institute of Comparative Political Studies, the 
intellectual migration from Russia in 1993-1995, with various 
alternatives in the development of the political and economic 
situation in the country, can constitute from 90,000 to 600,000 
specialists with higher education. We might note that this is 
with higher education in general, where there already a million 
nuclear scientists (although just one smart professor, by his 
departure, can considerably mix up the politicians' cards). At 
the same time the internal drain, the move of former scientists 
into commercial kiosks, shops, and simply to the church porch, 
will be several times greater --from 300,000 to 2 million. That 
is, at the maximum we can lose during that three-year period no 
more than 2.6 million scientists, and as a minimum... just 
390,000? "Rumors about the demise of Russian science are greatly 
exaggerated. But it actually has been knocked flat on its back 
and is scarcely breathing" -- one can understand the restrained 
"optimism" of I. Goldmen, the general director of the 
international ScienceInform Agency, since, with the favorable 
development of events, Russia may end up, as a result of the 
"brain drain"... on the positive side of the ledger! 
  It is expected that from 200,000 to 500,000 Russian-speaking 
specialists from the near abroad will emigrate to Russia, but 
"nowhere farther than that." True, for us there is no hope that 
at least they will self-relentlessly throw themselves into the 
breach in Russian science. 
  Intelligent planning does exist in a free market economy: 
relying on forecasts of a Russian "brain drain," a number of 
countries have already reduced the number of students studying a 
number of specialties. Why study for five to ten years and spend 
money on a young specialist, when you can get, from distant and 
mysterious Russia, one who is already more experienced and 
also... a bit cheaper? 
  This is also, of course, a counteraction to this process: 
hundreds of Russian scientific "masters" are already getting 
salary increases as a result of their title and also "for 
nondeparture," and thousands of scientists of a slightly lesser 
rank are receiving money from the state budget, while the 
scientific institutions themselves are attempting at any cost, 
by using true statements or false ones, to get bank credit. But 
how serious are these actions? According to evaluations made the 
European Council's Commission on Education, the loss from the 
"brain drain" will constitute for Russia $50 billion! In the 
meantime, however, in order to avoid those losses, we have 
expended amounts of money that are smaller by a factor of 
hundreds or thousands. That means that, with the passage of 
time, we will be like the miser in the famous saying, and will 
end up paying twice as much. 
  But even this is not the most important thing. If, for a 
long, long time you remove from any country the most intelligent 
people, as a result of the process of selection you will have a 
situation in that country in which, as the Europeans say, "the 
only thing left between their ears will be hair!"

<F P=106> [Interview with Igor Ivanov, deputy minister of foreign </F>
affairs of the Russian Federation, by Dmitriy Osipov, RIA 
NOVOSTI, special for SEGODNYA, in Damascus; date not given: 
"Igor Ivanov: No Matter How Difficult the Path of Negotiations 
Is, There Is No Alternative"] 
  [Text] After completing his visit to Syria last week, 
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation 
Igor Ivanov provided some details of his visit to an RIAN 
correspondent before his departure for Moscow. 
  [Osipov] To what extent is Russia satisfied with Syria's 
position in the Near East settlement? 
  [Ivanov] It is impossible to say that someone should be 
satisfied with someone else's position on this question. After 
the tragedy in Hebron, Syria, as is known, together with other 
Arab countries, stopped participating in negotiations; 
therefore, the main task now is to renew negotiations. Damascus 
is not satisfied at present with their progress, inasmuch as it 
does not see any specific results. At the same time, both Syria 
and Russia agree that there is no alternative to the negotiating 
process and, no matter how difficult the path may be, it is 
necessary to follow it. During the meeting with President Asad 
mutual interest was expressed in activating cooperation in this 
direction. The Syrian president noted that the negotiating 
process has a lot of enemies, and any disruption plays into 
their hands. He assessed the role of Russia highly, emphasizing 
that the presence of Russia is an important stabilizing element 
in the Near East, an element without which it is difficult to 
count on the achievement of a truly just and all-encompassing 
peace. 
  [Osipov] The opinion exists among Syrians that the "peak" of 
our mutual relations has passed into history. Some are even 
saying that Russia has turned its back on Syria. Actually, 
Damascus of late has repeatedly received U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher and his predecessor, while the head of our MFA 
[Ministry of Foreign Affairs] has still not visited Syria. 
  [Ivanov] I would put it differently. The "peak" in the fall 
of our relations has passed. I passed a message to President 
Asad from President Yeltsin that speaks absolutely definitely of 
our firm intention to develop full-fledged relations with Syria. 
A similar statement is contained in the reply that I am taking 
to Moscow. That is, there is a definite political will to take 
the path of building our relations. There really was a 
slump--for objective reasons associated with many factors in our 
country and with the international situation; however, it is 
impossible to say that someone tried to turn away from someone. 
Incidentally, the Syrian president did not dramatize this 
situation, and he perceived it as objective reality. He said: We 
have always believed that this was a transition period, and that 
the future of Russo-Syrian relations will be based on the past 
many years of history and not on the current state of affairs. 
As for the visit of the minister, such visits should be preceded 
by specific preparations. I do not rule out the arrival of 
Minister Kozyrev in Syria in the future, as well as the arrival 
of high-ranking delegations along other lines. I think that we 
will increase contacts in various directions. 
  [Osipov] Including in the sphere of military-technical 
cooperation? 
  [Ivanov] We are ready to develop this sphere as well. A 
Russian delegation was in Syria recently and prepared a draft 
intergovernment agreement, which we expect will be signed and 
will create the basis for cooperation. Military contacts at the 
highest level are also expected. 
  [Osipov] Was the question of Syria's debt to Russia 
broached? 
  [Ivanov] We inherited this serious question, and it is 
necessary to resolve it. We arranged with President Asad that a 
delegation of Russian experts from the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations would come to Damascus in the near future in 
order, jointly with the Syrian side, to prepare such variants of 
decisions that would not infringe on the interests of either 
side. However, the task is not simple, and a quick resolution 
should not be expected. 
  [Osipov] Is the Syrian side moving willingly to settle this 
question? 
  [Ivanov] No one moves willingly to pay off debts, but I 
sensed a quite constructive mood and desire to resolve this 
problem--today, perhaps, this is the sole sore point that is a 
definite irritant in our relations. Considering that both we and 
the Syrians are interested in ridding relations of all 
irritants, it can be assumed that their attitude is quite normal.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin: "Russia-Germany: Problems </F>
and Prospects of Cooperation"] 
  [Text] After the collapse of the former USSR many political 
scientists in both West and East Europe assessed the outlook for 
the development of Russo-German relations rather gloomily. Of 
course, there was a reason for this skepticism. After all, 
relations between Russia, which started on the path to 
democracy, and a united Germany were supposed to be built on a 
principally new basis. But it is not that easy to establish such 
a basis in a short time. Especially since both countries are 
experiencing great difficulties in the economy, the social 
sphere, and domestic political life. 
  However, daily difficulties have not overshadowed the 
long-term promising objectives of bilateral cooperation. In the 
opinion of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Germany 
remains, as before, a key country for Russia, and an important 
trade-economic and political partner. Seventeen percent of our 
foreign trade turnover falls to it. The regular meetings of the 
top leaders of Russia and the FRG indicate the scale of current 
Russo-German relations. It is known in Western capitals that no 
other state leader in Europe will maintain such close contacts 
with Moscow as Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  But, of course, by far not everything is smooth in relations 
between Russia and Germany. First of all, the Germans are 
disturbed by the fact that until now Moscow has not been in a 
position to pay its total debt in the amount of DM87 billion, 
which piled up as far back as Soviet times. To regulate the 
situation, in 1993 the Russian Federation and the FRG signed an 
Intergovernment Agreement on Consolidation of the Debt of Russia 
and the Former USSR, in accordance with which we were granted a 
deferment for 10 years. Germany is making considerable efforts 
to include Russia in the system of world economic relations, to 
a considerable degree assisting the development of Russia's 
relations with the European Union. There is talk in particular 
about the formulation of a treaty on cooperation and partnership 
on conditions that are acceptable to Russia. The Germans are 
also supporting Russia's officially becoming the eighth member 
of the G-7, first and foremost in the political sphere. 
  Moscow and Bonn support multilateral contacts on military 
policy. Joint military-naval exercises of large units of the 
Russian and FRG navies will be held this year. Troop exercises 
on the tactical subunit level are also being planned for the 
future. A center for training and retraining our servicemen who 
are returning from Germany for civilian specialties was opened 
recently in the Russian capital with the financial assistance of 
the FRG. 
  Russia and Germany are activating cooperation in 
international affairs that has attained significant maturity, 
first and foremost in UN and CSCE policy. The FRG has declared 
its readiness to support Russia's application to join the 
Council of Europe. Bonn, which has many times shown itself a 
supporter of creating strategic partnership relations between 
Russia and NATO, supports the inclusion of Russia in the new 
structures of collective security of Europe. 
  Bonn has welcomed the efforts of Russian diplomacy to lift 
the crisis situation around Sarajevo, and it supported Boris 
Yeltsin's proposal on convening a meeting of the leaders of 
Russia and the leading European states and the United States to 
consider questions of a Bosnian settlement. 
  Leading circles in the FRG pay appropriate attention to the 
appeals of representatives of the Russian leadership to use the 
FRG's influence on the question of observing the rights of the 
Russian-speaking population in Estonia and Latvia in the spirit 
of the decisions of international human rights organizations. 
They believe that the problem of ethnic Russians in these 
countries should not become a "bone of contention" in interstate 
relations, and they appraise pertinent anti-Russian statements 
of individual Baltic leaders as unacceptable and out of place.

Germany Will Not Increase Our Wealth"]

  --State economic commission under the president of the USSR 
(1990) 
  --Commission under the president of the USSR on questions of 
withdrawing Soviet troops from Germany (1991) 
  --Commission under the Government of the Russian Federation

Federation, placed under the jurisdiction of Vice President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy (established on 1 March 1993 and dissolved on 
28 June 1993) 
  [End boxed item] 
  The government decree "On State Property of the Russian 
Federation in the FRG," which was put into official distribution 
yesterday, assigns to Goskomimushchestvo the right to manage all 
Russian real estate in Germany, except that which is under the 
operational jurisdiction of "Russian ministry establishments 
abroad." The latest attempt to regulate the relations of Russian 
departments associated with property abroad was undertaken when 
what is most valuable for Russia in Germany--the legacy of the 
Western Group of Troops--is already being turned over to German 
authorities; moreover, free of charge. 
  There is nothing new in the text of the decree. Its central 
point is this: Decisions on the sale, assignment as security, 
placement in authorized capital, or removal of Russian property 
in the FRG are made by the Government of Russia on the 
representation of the State Committee for Management of State 
Property, and in no other way. 
  The former Union property in Germany will be transferred yet 
again to the management of Russia's State Committee for 
Management of State Property, although Ukraine continues to 
demand a foreign share that is due it. While the Ukrainian 
reasoning may not be clear, the fact that the decree does not 
mention the Western Group of Troops requires comment. There is a 
presidential edict--"On Procedure for Selling Military Property 
Being Released" of 30 November 1992--according to which military 
property is sold by the Ministry of Defense, while the functions 
of control are reserved for the State Committee for Management 
of State Property. On the other hand, on 16 December 1992, Boris 
Yeltsin and FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared jointly that 
real estate of the Western Group of Troops will be transferred 
to the German authorities without compensation. Thus, the train 
has already left (it is worth mentioning that the not unknown 
Dmitriy Yakubovskiy in his time valued Union military property 
in Germany at the lower level of DM12 billion.) 
  What does the civilian Russian property held in abeyance in 
Germany represent? The "apparatus of representatives" of the 
State Committee for Management of State Property in Germany, the 
weak descendant of the State Economic Mission in Germany under 
the president of the USSR, is seeking an answer to this 
question. The genealogical tree of the "apparatus of 
representatives" is branching out, reflecting the abrupt changes 
regarding military property, and has naturally taken on a 
political coloration. Some answers have been found. A typical 
example--the former House of Soviet Science and Culture has been 
transferred by presidential edict to the Federal Information 
Center. As is known, on 6 May 1992, Mikhail Poltoranin tried on 
behalf of the Russian Government to transfer the building free 
of charge to a German company with limited responsibility; 
however, the transaction was declared invalid. As a result, the 
State Committee for Management of State Property will have to 
bear responsibility for the possible commercialization of 
Russian real estate that remains in Germany.

<H5>  Expenditures on the First Stage of Reconstruction of </H5>
Novosibirsk Airport 
  The total cost of the project is $1.2 billion. The first 
stage of reconstruction envisions the building of cargo 
terminals (volume of investments--$70 million): Development of 
the infrastructure of cargo terminals--$11 million, construction 
of the air terminal building--$45 million, and the organization 
of the auxiliary complex and technical services (customs, 
militia, loading platform, service system, hotels, etc.)--$14 
million. 
  [End boxed item] 
  A business plan for the reconstruction of the 
Novosibirsk international airport developed by a consortium of 
U.S. consulting firms headed by the Ernst &amp; Young Company was 
approved on 4 April. Thus one of the largest projects in the 
reconstruction of Russian airports, in terms of the volume of 
capital investment, acquired a technical and financial 
basis. 
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already repeatedly talked about the 
situation concerning the planned reconstruction of Novosibirsk 
airport (see 24 and 27 January issues). At the end of March, 
during the visit to the United States of a delegation of the 
joint-stock company Transsibavia, studies were approved of a 
business plan for the reconstruction of the airport by a group 
of American firms headed by the Ernst &amp; Young Company, and on 
the evening of 4 April its final variant as well. 
  The total cost of reconstruction is estimated by specialists 
of Ernst &amp; Young at $1.2 billion. Inasmuch as the total 
volume 
of reconstruction work may continue until the year 2030, its 
implementation is envisioned in stages. Reconstruction in the 
first stage is planned to use up about $60-80 million (see boxed 
item). An important condition for the implementation of the 
project, as is noted in the business plan, is the conduct of 
structural changes and the resubordination of the Novosibirsk 
airport Tolmachevo from federal to oblast property, which will 
make it possible to activate work on reconstruction and control 
the expenditure of resources. 
  As was reported by Aleksandr Fokin, deputy director of 
foreign relations of the joint-stock company Transsibavia, the 
consortium of firms headed by the consulting firm Ernst &amp; 
Young 
Company conducted a study of the business plan starting in April 
1993. During its preparation, consultations were conducted with 
16 aviation companies of the world, the U.S. Treasury, the IMF, 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, and also airports at 
Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
  So reputable a list of consultants indicates the 
significance 
that is being given abroad to the appearance on the 
Transsiberian main line of a large air terminal complex that 
meets world standards. The fact is that practically all the 
large aviation companies in the world (for example, Lufthansa, 
JAL, and a number of others) use the Transsiberian route for 
flights to Japan and Alaska, which makes it possible to save 
almost 30 percent flight time and fuel in comparison with 
flights across the Polar Circle. Naturally the aviation 
companies (including Aeroflot) are interested in the development 
of the infrastructure of one of the world's most important air 
routes. This gives reason to suppose that general contractors 
and sources of financing will be established in the near future.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Andrey Kozyrev and </F>
Margaretha af Uglass Meet in Pskov; Negotiations Conducted in 
the Context of Russia's Regional Policy"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Diplomacy </H5>
  The "private setting" of the visit to Pskov of Swedish 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas, where Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs [MFA] Andrey Kozyrev conducted 
negotiations yesterday within the framework of an official trip, 
was disturbed by a "newspaper phantom" that appeared the day 
before in the Russian media. A Xerox copy of a "directive of the 
president of the Russian Federation," which was provided by an 
official of the MFA and which came to Smolensk Square from 
Latvia and became a startling incident (including if not most of 
all for the Russian MFA), directed, "for the purposes of 
guaranteeing the security of the Russian Federation and the 
states of the Commonwealth" (the Latvian Republic also was on 
the list of well-wishers), the dispositioning of military bases 
on the territory of the CIS states and Latvia. This directive 
from the office of the president became the subject of Andrey 
Kozyrev's morning meeting with Russian Minister of Defense Pavel 
Grachev, the result of which, it must be assumed, enabled the 
diplomat to make the comment: "The appearance of this directive 
is very reminiscent of version number 1..." After evaluating the 
"newspaper phantom" as an attempt to verify the degree of mutual 
understanding between the president and the government, and 
between the Russian Ministry of Defense and the MFA, Kozyrev 
expressed the view that similar startling events are not able to 
influence the style of work of the Russian Foreign Policy 
Department. The negotiations with Swedish Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas, he said, are occurring within the 
context of the regional policy of Russia, just like the 
creation, with Russia's well-known efforts, of the Baltic Sea 
States Council and the "Barents-Council." Given the 
participation in the negotiations of Vladislav Tumanov, the head 
of administration of Pskov Oblast, the Russian side proposes as 
a subject of negotiations the construction of housing and the 
creation of new jobs for settlers from the Baltic region and 
other regions of the former USSR, and also housing of the 
contingent of troops that is being pulled out. According to the 
ecology program, it is proposed to build a series of 
purification facilities and extensive processing of silt residue 
within the scope of the ecological program for the protection of 
the Baltic Sea basin. Projects in the sphere of the development 
of the foreign economic potential of the Russian province 
pertain to the participation of Swedish entrepreneurs in the 
establishment of a joint-stock company, Pskov International 
Trade Center. The development of transport communications within 
the scope of the program Via Baltika with respect to Pskov 
Oblast supposes the establishment of regular cargo, passenger, 
and tourist runs, with the joint use of the Pskov international 
airport and international highways that are being planned on the 
territory of the oblast. Considering the data of the export 
fund, according to which about 10 percent of Russian exports 
transited through bordering Pskov Oblast, it is proposed to 
establish a network of freight terminals on the border with 
Belarus, Latvia, and Estonia. The program also proposes to 
expand and intensify contacts in the spheres of health services, 
culture, and tourism. The investments of the Swedish business 
world in the economy of the oblast should involve extensive 
processing of timber and peat beds, the processing of 
agricultural products, the establishment of enterprises and 
highly technological products in the area of machine building, 
electronics, and light industry. Individual paragraphs discuss 
close regional cooperation in the sphere of joint operations in 
the processing of flax. 
  At the conclusion of the negotiations, in a news conference 
arranged for domestic and foreign journalists, Russian Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev said that the meeting of old 
friends (that is the way he introduced his relations with the 
Swedish colleague) was taking place within the context of 
Russia's regional policy. The idea was expressed in the reply of 
Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas that 
Sweden, expecting to become a member of the European Union on 1 
January of next year, hopes that it will be able through its 
authority to make a contribution to the cause of strengthening 
stability in the Baltic region. "It is necessary to build a new 
Europe together with Russia," the head of the foreign policy 
department of Sweden is convinced. Concerning the territorial 
claims of Estonia and the hypothetically possible role in them 
of Sweden, Ugglas said that Sweden recognized Estonia within the 
framework of the existing borders. But border questions, in her 
opinion, can be resolved within the framework of practical 
contacts.

<F P=106> [Article by Goran Ek: "South Coast To Become Important Trade </F>
Area"] 
  [Text] The coastal belt along the eastern Gulf of Finland 
will, according to a just-released development program, be 
developed into a strong economic center, which at the same time 
will be a hub for traffic especially with the St. Petersburg 
area. 
  The development plan covers some 10 subprojects concerning 
traffic, environment, and trade with areas to the east. 
Sponsoring the program and the coastal project regarding the 
Gulf of Finland are such private groups as the regional 
associations of the Kymi River Valley, eastern Uusimaa, and 
Uusimaa, as well as the individual municipalities along the 
coast. 
  Among other things, it is proposed that Europe Highway Route 
18 [E18] be improved, and that the train between Helsinki and 
St. Petersburg be able to transit the stretch in two and a half 
hours. The sponsoring groups also want to improve know-how on 
trade with Russia and Russian business culture, as well as to 
increase teaching of the Russian language at all levels of 
education. 
  "The coastal project has been under way for two years, and 
the purpose has been to introduce cooperation in order to 
develop business, improve the environment and promote regional 
culture in the area." This was said by Tapio Valinoro, director 
of a landscape company and chairman of the Kymi River Valley 
Development Association. 
  A basket with 60 concrete development projects are included 
in the development project for the Gulf of Finland. From these 
60, the involved parties--the state, municipalities, businesses, 
and private associations--can select which individual projects 
concern them, and can in conjunction with others move them 
forward. Those elements considered of overall strategic 
importance are: improvement of land communications--E18 and the 
rail route; developing environmental technology; improvement of 
knowledge regarding Russia; betterment of safety; and 
establishing planning cooperation over the border. 
<H5>  Transit Traffic for 6-7 Billion Markkas </H5>
  The better the communications to St. Petersburg, the more 
attractive will be the coastal region to those businesses 
wanting to establish themselves in the Russian market, reason 
the drafters. 
  The coastal zone in southeast Finland is the most rapid and 
secure transportation route from the United States (via 
Rotterdam and Amsterdam) and West Europe to Russia and the other 
countries of the former Soviet Union. 
  "This now involves a market of perhaps 2 billion markkas per 
year, but if the entire transportation chain is taken into 
account, this is estimated to be at least from 6-7 billion 
markkas," says Valinoro. 
  E18 should be [re]built as a four-lane highway or 
expressway. 
The most difficult bottlenecks are found on the Russian side of 
the border and in Vyborg. The railroads are going to be even 
more a key factor in the Russian transportation system, and rail 
will therefore be the only realistic alternative when large 
volumes of cargo are to be transported for long distances. 
<H5>  Time Works in Favor of Helibannan [new Helsinki-St. </H5>
Petersburg Rail Route] 
  "Considering all this, it is clear that time is working in 
favor of a future Helibannan," Valinoro claims. 
  The present rail route to Russia should be improved so that 
the Pendolino train can transit the Helsinki-St. Petersburg 
stretch in four and a half hours. 
  With this is would be possible to make one-day round trips 
between the two cities, either for purposes of business or 
shopping. In the long term a new, more direct rail line to the 
east is going to prove necessary, and then the travel time can 
be reduced--in the best case--to two and a half hours. 
  Development of environmental technology relates to the key 
industrial areas along the Gulf of Finland's coastal belt. 
  The adjacent areas within the CIS and the Baltic countries 
are to constitute the most important markets for Finnish 
environment companies. An action program must now be drafted 
which will make it possible for Finnish companies to participate 
in environment projects requiring international financing 
arrangements in the former Soviet area. Such a program should 
cover needs in Russia and, at the same time, involve 
international financing and Finnish know-how. 
  In comparison with many other areas, especially Tallinn and 
Riga, which are in competition for the role of entry ports to 
Russia and the East, the Finnish areas along the Gulf of Finland 
have an important weak point: our knowledge of the Russian 
language, and our familiarity with Russian mores and practices 
and the Russian culture are poor. 
<H5>  Head Start of 5-10 Years </H5>
  At the same time, we have a time jump of perhaps 10-15 years 
in comparison to Finland. 
  This should be exploited as soon as possible, according to 
Valinoro. 
  "The opportunities for studying Russian should be expanded 
at 
all educational levels. To awaken a greater interest in Russian 
new teaching materials should be developed which reflect the 
new, dynamic economy and culture now going on, instead of the 
bygone Soviet era and its linguistic usages. 
  "It is also important to activate cooperation in education 
and research, and to create new programs for practicum 
exchanges, as well as exchange programs in culture and sports." 
  The border between Finland and Russia is perhaps the world's 
deepest living-standards gap. This creates tension and strong 
undercurrents. To master them is a difficult job which will 
likewise yield profit if handled well. The situation in Russia 
is instable and its future prospects partly concealed in 
darkness. This creates insecurity and risks, but also 
opportunities for progress for capable business people. A 
careful but, at the same time, flexible border regime is under 
these circumstances a necessary precondition for crossborder 
economic cooperation, as well as cooperation in general, to run 
safely and smoothly.

<F P=106> [Article by Olli Ainola: "Baltic Policy: Arms Sale </F>
Restrictions Being Rescinded"] 
  [Text] Finland has changed the principles of its arms sale 
policy. Prevention of exports has been converted to promotion of 
exports. As its domestic sales are drying up, the defense 
industry is attempting to assure its survival through export 
sales. 
  A promising market is seen in the former Warsaw Pact 
countries, especially the Baltics, after Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the export control 
organization, makes changes in its structure this week. Finland 
is following other Western countries, including the United 
States, that have decided to rescind the arms export ban to 
those countries, even for combat aircraft. 
  The enthusiasm of Finnish arms plants for exporting to the 
Baltic countries has been held in check above all by the 
Paasikivi Doctrine [policy formulated by post-World War II 
President J.K. Paasikivi according to which Finland should 
refrain from actions displeasing to Moscow]. The foreign policy 
leadership has not wanted to provide export licenses for actual 
lethal weapons and equipment as long as there are Russian 
military units in the Baltic countries. 
  A couple of years ago, the Sako arms plant was denied a 
license to export 5,000 assault rifles to any of the three 
Baltic countries. According to officials, the application was 
purely a demonstration of intent, because the document lacked 
end-user information, among other things. Sako said it had 
provided end-user information, and that the export sale was 
prevented solely for political reasons. 
  If Russian forces withdraw from the Baltic countries and the 
situation becomes stable, authorities promise to free the export 
of arms and combat equipment. Even after these conditions are 
met, however, licenses are going to be carefully considered, 
especially if a deal were to involve a political commitment to 
provide spare parts or resupply in event of crisis or war. 
  The first preview of the new policy may soon be seen. Finns 
have under discussion deals for final assembly work, selling 
components and raw materials to ammunition plants in Estonia and 
Latvia. The licenses officials regard these deals favorably.

"The Border as a Region of Cooperation: That Is What the Border 
Guards of Russia and China Want"] 
  [Text] Local Russian contacts between border guard 
districts and military and border guard structures in the 
People's Republic of China regarding protection of the state 
border, underway for several years already, now require the 
involvement of central ministries. Resolution of the political 
and professional matters that have arisen in the process of 
establishing a system for protection of the state border was the 
subject of an initial visit by a delegation of senior members of 
the General Staff (the agency which, together with the PRC 
Ministry of Public Security, deals with border protection 
matters) to Moscow, where talks are underway with the Russian 
Federal Border Guard Service. 
  At a joint press conference held at the conclusion of the 
first stage of the Russo-Chinese talks, Col. Gen. Andrey 
Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of border guards and head of the 
Russian Federation Federal Border Guard Service, and Maj. Gen. 
Kui Fulin, assistant chief of the General Staff, Chinese 
People's Liberation Army, were unanimous in the opinion that 
"the borders between the great countries of Russia and China 
must become a region of peace and cooperation." In order to make 
that wish a reality it will be necessary to sign bilateral 
agreements at the level of border guard agencies and 
governmental structures in both states (primarily at issue is 
protection of the eastern sector of the Russian border and the 
Kirghiz and Tajik sectors of the CIS border). The Russian side, 
according to Col. Gen. Nikolayev, is prepared to present its 
packet of proposals during a visit to China by Russian head of 
government Chernomyrdin. The Chinese delegation, elaborately 
noting the "great amount of time required for documents to move 
through official agencies in China" is not at all inclined to 
link its efforts with that high-level guest's visit to China. 
  The main focus of concern for border guard administrations 
in 
both states should be the establishment of a "civilized" border 
guard regime along the so-called first and second lines, i.e. at 
the border crossing level, with the number of crossing points 
commensurate to the region's economic needs. Consideration 
should also be given to professional contacts between Russian 
and Chinese border guard structures in the Russian Federation's 
Pacific, Far Eastern and Transbaikal border guard districts and 
China's corresponding border guard provinces with regard to 
interdiction of violations of the state border, for the purpose 
of combatting organized crime in both countries. 
  In the opinion of Andrey Nikolayev the negotiations on 
reduction of arms and armed forces and on confidence-building 
measures and demarcation work along the Chinese-Russian border 
that are being conducted between diplomatic ministries in the 
Russian Federation and the PRC attest to the normal relations 
between our countries, and Russia's border guards are prepared 
to reinforce and expand those diplomatic successes. It did not 
seem that their Chinese colleagues had any objection to doing 
so, either.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Gavrilov under the heading "Analysis": </F>
"Security in the Asia-Pacific Region: Conflicts Between 
Countries in the Region Could Change the Balance of Power"] 
  [Text] The potential sources of conflict in the 
Asia-Pacific region at the present time are more closely 
connected with economic, territorial and interethnic disputes 
than with sociopolitical development and the struggle against 
the "Red menace," the slogan under which various opposing groups 
of states in the Asia-Pacific region long existed in the postwar 
period. 
  The new realities of the modern world have resulted in the 
emergence of new opportunities for the states of the 
Asia-Pacific region relative to Russia in view of: its role in 
possible elimination of tension on the Korean Peninsula; 
negotiations between Moscow and Tokyo over the future of four 
islands in the Kuril archipelago that would have been 
unimaginable literally just a few years ago; the clear interest 
by South Korea, Japan and, to some extent, China in relations 
with Siberia and the Russian Far East, which they believe with 
their investments could become a new source of economic growth 
in Asia; and reduction of Russia's armed forces and military 
presence in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Analysis indicates that on the whole Russia's role as the 
subject and object of policy in the region has shifted from a 
leading role to one on a par with Australia, Taiwan or South 
Korea. This was the inevitable result, of the one hand, of the 
disintegration of the USSR and, on the other, of policy by the 
Russian MFA that is not adequate to the newly emerging 
conditions of the international situation. In addition, the 
states in the region remain somewhat cautious with regard to 
Russia's political future. 
  Much greater concern currently exists due to the fact that 
one now finds a paradoxical situation in the Asia-Pacific region 
as a result of lessening East-West confrontation: disarmament by 
the great powers is prompting efforts by the smaller states to 
arm, negatively affecting security in the region. 
  What is the reason for this paradoxical situation, in which 
not a single state in the region has taken advantage of the 
peace dividend to reduce its defense expenditures? One must 
define several of the most significant factors. The first is 
economic conflicts within the Asia-Pacific region. The unequal 
economic development of states in the region contributes to a 
certain degree to tensions based on envy -- North Korea, 
Cambodia and the Philippines have found themselves left out of 
economic prosperity. 
  Distrust and hostility in relations between the United 
States 
and Japan have tremendous destructive potential, due to American 
dissatisfaction over the closed nature of the Japanese market, 
the Japanese economic invasion of the United States, and tax 
evasion or failure to pay taxes by Japanese companies operating 
in the United States. It has been asserted that over the long 
term a possible emotional gap could tear apart the 
Washington-Tokyo alliance and replace it with keen competition 
which would undoubtedly impact other Asian countries and the 
region's security as well. 
  There is a fairly great likelihood that economic and 
consequently political disputes will arise between the states 
that comprise the "Asian economic realm," the North American 
free trade zone (NAFTA) and the European Union. Even now East 
Asia accounts for 62 percent of world automotive production, 82 
percent of telecommunications manufacturing and 81 percent of 
computer equipment production. According to a projection by the 
Japanese Center for Economic Research made in February 1992, by 
the year 2010 the "Asian economic realm," extending from eastern 
Russia to Myanmar and including both Australia and New Zealand, 
is expected to be producing as many goods and services as North 
and South America combined. Asia's overall GNP will be $11.8 
trillion, in comparison with $11.2 trillion for North and South 
America and $11.4 trillion for Western Europe. In 2010 prices 
Japan alone will have a GNP of $16 trillion, or 84 percent of 
the U.S. GNP. In this situation it is very likely that there 
will be sharp competition, particularly between East Asia and 
NAFTA, and that could significantly affect stability in the 
region. 
  Another group of disputes stem from the struggle for 
political leadership in Asia and the various concomitant 
manifestations of various peoples' national consciousness. 
  We are beginning to see the prospect of a Greater China 
being 
formed through a merger of the PRC's economically developed 
coastal provinces with the economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Macao. Eventually Greater China could become the main force 
capable of opposing the Japanese economic battering ram. 
  In South Korea there are some politicians and business 
people 
who dream of a "Greater Korea." They believe that after 
reunification Korea could become one of the most important 
economic zones in the world, with the one million ethnic Koreans 
in China and the approximately 300,000 in Russia added to 
Korea's population of 70 million. They also include the 
surrounding Chinese and Russian population, coming up with the 
possibility of creating a demographic base of 200 million people 
and, consequently, a new center for the Asian economy. 
  The question is how fast Korean unification can proceed. 
Considering Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, it is possible that 
the agreement reached by North and South Korea in December 1991 
regarding nuclear-free status for the Korean Peninsula, economic 
exchanges, rapprochement and unification might not be 
implemented. On the other hand, politicians literally break out 
in a cold sweat at the thought of a unified Korea with nuclear 
weapons. Furthermore, much remains unclear about how North Korea 
will behave after Kim Il-Song is gone. 
  A certain degree of unclarity exists concerning China's 
political outlook in the post-Deng Xiaoping era. Specifically, 
analysts are considering the possibility of political 
instability and disorder in China, as a result of which a flood 
of refugees could pour into the Southeast Asian countries. 
However, there are clear signals that although there are fairly 
serious disagreements and a certain degree of ideological 
instability within the Chinese Communist Party -- China's ruling 
party -- Chinese communists are united against the threat of 
disorder, anarchy and spontaneous disintegration of their 
country. 
  However, the Chinese leadership understands the needs for 
accelerated reforms in the economy, as successes in that area 
would undoubtedly be a factor in the stability of Chinese 
society. Therefore one may assume with a fair degree of 
certainty that though there might be some retrenchment after 
Deng Xiaoping due to a stronger position for the conservative 
political wing of the Chinese leadership, it is likely that this 
would be followed by stronger reformist tendencies. 
  One significant factor is the current state and outlook for 
development of Russo-Chinese relations. Here no struggle for 
leadership is at issue. Geopolitical interests -- mutual efforts 
to ensure the security of borders, a need to ensure favorable 
external conditions so that reforms can be implemented, 
Beijing's interest in Russian economy and military capability, 
reduction of the two sides' armed forces and armaments, stronger 
confidence-building measures, Russia's interest in developing 
economic and military relations with China, and, finally, a 
certain mutual attraction in the search for a counterweight 
against the West's political offensive -- all prompt Russia and 
China to seek means of rapprochement. 
  One significant obstacle to the development of relations 
could be a possible upsurge in Chinese nationalism and the 
pro-Western slant which, in the opinion of the Chinese, exists 
in Russia's policy. A significant negative role could also be 
played by the personality factor when members of the "Cultural 
Revolution" generation come to power in China. 
  However, both sides are interested in developing economic 
cooperation. That interest is reinforced by mutual pragmatism, 
as a result of which certain differences on various issues would 
not likely be allowed to stand in the way. 
  Much remains unclear regarding Sino-American relations. 
China, in its effort to assume an appropriate place in the new 
world political structure, has unofficially accepted a mission 
as leader of the developing countries. In the opinion of Chinese 
political scientists, the disintegration of the USSR is a 
fait accompli and the USSR will never be reborn. 
Meanwhile, according to them, the United States, which remains 
the sole superpower in the world, is losing influence. China is 
outraged by the fact that since the collapse of the USSR the 
United States feels that it has a right to intervene in the 
internal affairs of other countries and impose its own values. 
China believes that the new world order should be based on fair 
political and economic principles in order to prevent a widening 
of the gap between a wealthy North and an impoverished South. 
  Nevertheless, China definitely does not intend to get into 
an 
open confrontation with the United States. It remains interested 
in developing relations with the leading Western countries 
because it needs new technology and investment. In the opinion 
of Chinese political scientists, the fact that in the future 
global disputes may develop along West-West lines (between the 
United States, Western Europe and Japan) could give Beijing 
greater room for political and diplomatic maneuvering. 
  It is quite possible that as disputes between the various 
sides become more numerous their relations will be typified by 
ever-increasing harshness. It is also possible that the United 
States, in its usual forceful manner, might attempt to force 
China to behave in a way that is advantageous to the United 
States. How successful the Americans are in doing so would 
largely depend on Russia's position.

<F P=106> [Article by Lyudmila Zaslavskaya, senior scientific </F>
associate, Institute of Legislation and Comparative Legal 
Sciences, under the RF [Russian Federation] Government, 
candidate of legal sciences, RF honored jurist, under rubric 
"Legislation on Mineral Resources": "Survey of Laws on Mineral 
Resources of the Republics That Make Up the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] In accordance with the delimitation of the subjects 
of jurisdiction and powers between the federal agencies of state 
authority of the Russian Federation and the agencies of 
authority in the republics that make up the Russian Federation, 
legislation on mineral resources is included in the joint 
jurisdiction of the federal agencies of state authority of the 
Russian Federation and the agencies of state authority in the 
republics that make up the Russian the Russian Federation. 
  With regard to these questions the federal agencies of state 
authority of the Russian Federation publish the Principles of 
Legislation, in conformity with which the agencies of authority 
of the republics that make up the Russian Federation carry out 
their own legal regulation, including the enacting of laws and 
other legal acts. 
  On 21 February 1992 Russian Federation Law "Mineral 
Resources" was signed. In Article 1 of this law it is indicated 
that the law is in effect on the entire territory of the Russian 
Federation. The legislative and normative acts of the republics 
that make up the Russian Federation must not contradict this law. 
  An analysis was made of seven laws on the mineral resources 
of the republics that make up the Russian Federation, one code, 
and two decrees: Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources," 12 February 
1992; Udmurt Republic Law on Mineral Resources, 13 February 
1992; North Ossetian Republic Law, "Use of Mineral Resources in 
North Ossetian SSR," 27 October 1992; Republic of Buryatia Law, 
"Mineral Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral 
Resources," 28 October 1992; Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law, 
"Mineral Resources," 22 December 1992; Republic of Tatarstan 
Law, "Mineral Resources," 18 February 1993; Republic of 
Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources, 28 October 1992; 
Mordvinian SSR Supreme Council decree, 9 April 1993, "Procedure 
for Application of RSFSR Law, Entitled `Mineral Resources,' on 
the Territory of Mordvinian SSR"; and decree of the Government 
of the Republic of Tuva, 28 January 1993, No. 41, "Measures to 
Regulate the Relations in Use of the Mineral Resources of the 
Republic of Tuva." 
  Only two laws were enacted several days prior to the signing 
of the "Mineral Resources" Law; the others were enacted later. 
Therefore they must not contradict the "Mineral Resources" Law. 
At the same time, study has indicated that the republics that 
make up the Russian Federation are not taking into consideration 
the fact that the territory of the Russian Federation includes 
within itself territories of subjects of the Federation and 
those republics view themselves as independent sovereign states 
that are not subordinate to the Federation's central authority. 
  Certain republics that make up the Russian Federation, in 
laws on mineral resources, do not always mention the Russian 
Federation's "Mineral Resources" Law as the basis for 
promulgating their own act on mineral resources. 
  For example, in the Republic of Buryatia Law, "Mineral 
Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources" 
(Article 1), it is stipulated that the Republic of Buryatia 
legislation on mineral resources is based on the corresponding 
principles enunciated in the Republic of Buryatia Constitution 
and the Federative Treaty, in accordance with which the mineral 
resources of Buryatia are the property of the peoples living on 
its territory. 
  In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law (Article 1) it is 
stipulated that the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) legislation on 
mineral resources is based on the corresponding principles 
enunciated in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Constitution and 
the Russian Federation (Russian) Constitution. Similar 
formulations exist in the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on 
Mineral Resources and the laws of certain other republics. 
  The Republic of Tuva Government has limited in time the 
application of the RF Law "Mineral Resources." In a decree dated 
28 January 1993, entitled "Measures to Regulate the Relations in 
the Use of the Mineral Resources of the Republic of Tuva," it is 
indicated that, pending the enactment of the Republic of Tuva 
Law, "Mineral Resources," state regulation of the relations in 
the use of mineral resources on the territory of the Republic of 
Tuva is carried out on the basis of RF Law "Mineral Resources"; 
the statute governing the granting of licenses for the use of 
mineral resources, which was approved by RF Supreme Soviet 
decree, dated 15 July 1992, No. 3314-1; and the Statute 
governing the rules and conditions for collecting payments for 
the right to use the mineral resources, which was approved by RF 
Government decree dated 289 October 1992, No. 828. 
  The Udmurt Republic, in its Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 
4), has stated that the Russian Federation's legislation on 
mineral resources is in effect on the territory of the Udmurt 
Republic so far as it does not contradict the Udmurt Republic 
Law on mineral resources. According to Article 7 of that law, 
questions that have not been included in the competency of the 
Udmurt Republic and the local soviets of people's deputies are 
under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation with regard to 
the regulation of mining relations. 
  Despite the fact that Russian Federation Law "Mineral 
Resources" failed to mention the question of the ownership of 
the mineral resources, and also failed to divide the state's 
mineral resources fund into any component parts, the republics 
that make up the Russian Federation have expressed their own 
point of view with regard to these questions. 
  In Komi SSR (Article 2) the mineral resources on the 
territory of Komi SSR are considered to be the republic property 
of Komi SSR; and in Udmurt Republic (Article) the mineral 
resources are the state property of the Udmurt Republic, and the 
use of the republic's mineral resources can be carried out for 
the benefit of the peoples living on its territory. 
  In North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), Republic of Buryatia 
(Article 2), Republic of Bashkortostan (Article 2), Republic of 
Sakha (Yakutia) (Article 2), and Republic of Karelia (Article 
2), stipulation is made for republic mineral resources funds. 
  In accordance with Russian Federation Supreme Soviet decree, 
dated 27 December 1991, entitled "Delimitation of State Property 
in the Russian Federation Into Federal Property, State Property 
of the Republics That Make Up the Russian Federation, Krays, 
Oblasts, Autonomous Oblast Autonomous Okrugs, the Cities of 
Moscow and St. Petersburg, and Municipal Property," the 
resources of the continental shelf pertain exclusively to 
federal property. Despite this fact, the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia), in Law "Mineral Resources," stated that the republic 
fund is made up of the parts of the mineral resources that are 
being used and that are not being used, as well as the 
continental shelf of the territory of the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia). The disposition of the republic mineral resources 
fund in the interests of the peoples in the Republic is carried 
out by the Government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). 
  In Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 2) it 
is stipulated that the disposition of the state mineral 
resources fund is carried out in the interests of the peoples 
living on the corresponding territories, and all the peoples of 
the Russian Federation. Meanwhile the Udmurt Republic (Article 
2) and North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia) (Article 2), and the Republic of Karelia (Article 2) 
stipulated the disposition of the republic mineral resources 
fund only for the benefit of the peoples residing on the 
territory. 
  In a number of acts the competency of the Russian Federation 
in the sphere of regulating the relations in the use of mineral 
resources is not mentioned at all, or is defined in abbreviated 
form. According to the Law of the North Ossetian SSR (Article 
2), sectors can be allocated from the republic mineral resources 
fund for the purpose of guaranteeing state security and the 
protection of the environment. The borders of those sectors and 
the procedure for using the mineral resources on them are 
established by the enacting of joint decisions by the agencies 
of authority of the Russian Federation and the North Ossetian 
SSR. 
  This proviso does not guarantee the subject of the 
jurisdiction of the federal agencies of state authority of the 
Russian Federation, which already include the federal energy 
systems, nuclear power engineering, splitting materials, federal 
transportation, railroads, and activities in space. 
  All of these areas require mineral resources. 
  According to the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on Mineral 
Resources (Article 1), individual powers with regard to 
promulgating acts of legislation concerning the mineral 
resources of the Republic of Bashkortostan can be transferred to 
the Russian Federation in accordance with the Treaty on the 
principles of international relations between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Bashkortostan. Legislative acts 
of the Russian Federation concerning mineral resources with 
regard to questions transferred by the Republic of Bashkortostan 
to the Russian Federation are mandatory on the territory of the 
Republic of Bashkortostan, and in Article 3 of this Code it is 
stated that the Republic of Bashkortostan can transfer 
individual powers with regard to regulating the use of mineral 
resources both to the Russian Federation, and to the republic's 
rayons and cities. 
  Thus, the interrelations between the agencies for 
administering the Republic of Bashkortostan state mineral 
resources fund and the agency for administering the Russian 
Federation state mineral resources fund in questions of the 
functioning of the Russia-wide methodological and normative base 
for the use of mineral resources and the single base for 
geological information about mineral resources, as well as in 
other questions of use of mineral resources, are defined by 
bilateral agreements between them. 
  According to Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 5, 
paragraph 2), the interests of the Russian Federation in the 
area of the efficient placement and use of the mineral 
fuel-and-energy base are reinforced by treaty and other 
agreements with the Russian Federation. The Republic of Karelia, 
in its Law "Mineral Resources," states in detail the competency 
of the Russian Federation in the sphere of regulating the use of 
mineral resources. 
  In our opinion, it would be desirable to prepare, instead of 
the Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources," Principles of 
the Russian Federation Legislation on Mineral Resources, to 
define the owner of the mineral resources, to give a more 
clear-cut formulation of the concept of the mineral resources 
fund, and, to the extent possible, to reduce the competency of 
the Russian Federation in the sphere of the relations for 
regulating the use of mineral resources. Then there will be the 
possibility of enacting laws on the mineral resources of the 
republics that make up the Russian Federation in a new wording. 
  The Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources" provides a definition 
of 
the concept of mineral resources. It is the surface of the land 
and the space under it, excluding the agricultural stratum, with 
rocks, minerals, and containers. This definition omits the 
bottom of bodies of water, which is not the surface of the 
earth, and also the lower limit of the mineral resources to 
depths that are accessible for geological study and assimilation. 
  The Udmurt Republic also provides a definition of the 
concept 
of mineral resources. According to Article 1 of Law "Mineral 
Resources," the mineral resources of Udmurt Republic include 
that part of the natural environment within the confines of the 
republic's territory that lies below the soil stratum and the 
bottom of bodies of water to depths that are accessible for 
assimilation. This definition omits depths that are accessible 
for study. 
  The Republic of Udmurtia provides a definition of the fund, 
calling it not a mineral resources fund, but the Udmurt Republic 
state mining fund. According to Article 1 of its law, the 
mineral formations contained in the mineral resources, as well 
as other objects there that represent interest for study and 
industrial assimilation, constitute the state mining fund of the 
Udmurt Republic. 
  It is not completely clear what is meant by objects 
representing interest for study and industrial assimilation. One 
wonders whether these objects include a subway or an underground 
airfield. 
  According to Republic of Tatarstan Law "Mineral Resources" 
(Article 1), the mineral resources of the Republic of Tatarstan 
constitute that part of its natural environment that is situated 
under the soil and vegetation stratum, and under the bottom of 
lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, with the minerals contained in 
them, from their outcroppings to the daylight surface to depths 
that are accessible for geological study and assimilation. In 
our opinion, the definition of the concept of mineral resources 
is most precise in the Republic of Tatarstan law. 
  The same Tatarstan law contains Article 3, concerning mining 
relations. According to that article: 1) relations arising 
during the possession, disposition, and use of the mineral 
resources constitute mining relations; 2) the owner of the 
mineral resources, and the user of the mineral resources, are 
the subjects of mining relations; 3) the agencies of state 
authority and state administration of the Republic of Tatarstan, 
as well as the local administration, cannot be the user of the 
mineral resources; 4) the sector of the mineral resources 
(mining claim) that was granted to the user in the procedure 
established by this law is the object of the mining relations; 
5) the license and the mining-claim document which are issued in 
conformity with this law are acts that result in the arising of 
mining relations; 6) the license is a document that certifies 
the right to use the mineral resources within the confines of 
granted sector within a period of time established by the 
license, with the observance of the terms stipulated by it; 7) 
the mining-claim document is a document that grants the user of 
the mineral resources the right to carry out his activities 
within the confines of the mining claim in conformity with the 
purposes indicated in the license; 8) state administration of 
the use of mineral resources is carried out by the Government of 
Tatarstan or through agencies empowered for that purpose. 
  The overwhelming content of the article is nonnormative. It 
consists of definitions of concepts (of mining relations; of 
subjects and objects of mining relations;of acts that result in 
mining relations; of the license; and of the mining-claim 
document). In several laws this is usually stated at the 
beginning of the law, under the title "Terms Used in the Law." 
  As for the substantive content of the article, in our view 
the concept of mining relations does not encompass the 
protection of the mineral resources. This is an independent 
element of mining relations, and it must be pointed out. 
  Something that is not completely precise is the absolute ban 
preventing agencies of the state authority and state 
administration of the Republic of Tatarstan, as well as the 
local administration, from using the mineral resources. It would 
scarcely be desirable to deprive them even of the right to carry 
out the mining of generally widespread minerals, which right is 
granted to owners of sectors of land in accordance with Article 
5 of the law. 
  An article that is of definite interest is Article 4 of 
Republic of Tatarstan Law "Mineral Resources," which is devoted 
to objects of the right of ownership. According to this article, 
the property of the Republic of Tatarstan includes: 1) the 
mineral resources and the deposits of minerals that are located 
in them; 2) deposits situated on the territory of Tatarstan and 
contiguous territories in that part in which they are located in 
the Republic of Tatarstan; 3) deposits of minerals and sectors 
of mineral resources that were acquired by the republic within 
the confines of other territorial-administrative and 
national-state formations of the CIS and abroad; 4) information 
concerning the geological structure and mineral and 
raw-materials potential of the mineral resources that is 
received at the expense of funds from the state budget; 5) 
tailings of removed, surrounding, and side-recovery rocks, and 
storage facilities for other waste products, which form 
technologically exploitable resources of mineral raw materials 
that accumulate during the extraction, dressing, and processing 
of natural minerals. 
  From the text of the article on objects of the right of 
ownership it is evident that the republic is attempting to 
define as precisely as possible the limits of everything 
valuable that is its property. Unfortunately, it has not 
revealed in the law the methods by which the republic acquires 
deposits of minerals within the confines of other 
territorial-administrative and national-state formations of the 
CIS and abroad. 
  In the preamble to the Republic of Buryatia Law "Mineral 
Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources," there 
is a statute concerning the use of mineral resources in the 
drainage area of Lake Baykal, which is regulated by conditions 
governing special use of the natural environment, which are 
aimed at the unconditional preservation of Lake Baykal as 
national property of the Russian Federation. 
  The section of the law that is devoted to the efficient use 
and protection of the mineral resources contains Article 32, 
"Special Rules For Use of the Mineral Resources in the Drainage 
Area of Lake Baykal." According to this article, the use of the 
mineral resources in the water-protection zone of Lake Baykal is 
allowed only with the application and observance of 
technological schemes that preclude any runoffs or emissions 
that are capable of harming Lake Baykal or its ecosystem. The 
use of the mineral resources in the shore zone of Lake Baykal, 
with the exception of the study of the mineral resources without 
the carrying out of mining operations, the extraction of 
generally widespread minerals, and the construction of 
underground and water-intake structures with a depth of up to 10 
meters for their own needs by the owners and leasers of sectors 
of land, is prohibited. 
  In Article 19 of the Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources 
it is emphasized that users of the mineral resources to whom 
they are granted for purposes that are not linked with the 
abstraction of minerals, in the event that minerals are detected 
or appear on the sector that has been allocated to those users, 
must immediately report that fact to the agency that issued the 
license.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Verk: "Interests Will Decide Everything: </F>
Parliament in Cross-Section"] 
  [Text] Only the indolent, perhaps, have not made 
forecasts concerning today's event--the commencement of a 
professional parliament. The future of an "appendage" of the 
executive and pocket body or, on the contrary, a "nest" of the 
opposition, which for precisely this reason will shortly be 
"ravaged," has been predicted for the new corps of deputies. A 
grain of sense could, if so desired, be found in each of the 
adduced viewpoints. Nonetheless, we will venture to make one 
further forecast: The new parliament will be by no means a 
monolithic fifth column of the ruling state bureaucracy. It may 
with substantial reason be called an arena of the confrontation 
of group interests. And the country's future will, perhaps, 
depend on whoever gains the upper hand. 
  The past 70-plus years were marked by the consistent 
realization of the interests of a group of high-ranking party 
bureaucrats within a strict ideological framework. A vigilant 
eye was kept on the permanency of this framework by the powerful 
and well-oiled administrative-command machine--the CPSU. With 
the disintegration of the Soviet Empire new "interest groups" 
began to appear--primarily the national bureaucracy. Although 
today it is the interests of this group which are being realized 
the most fully, it aspires to enshrine this process and make it 
irreversible. It is this that explains to a considerable extent 
the attempts, first, to shape a single national ideology of 
"market reforms in the name of the prosperity of Kazakhstan" (we 
recall if only the birth of the SNEK [Union of People's Unity of 
Kazakhstan] in February 1993) and, second, to legitimize its 
power (the self-dissolution of the former parliament--a "result 
of the totalitarian past"--and the elections of a new one). 
Analyzing the events of the end of the last and the start of the 
present year, it may be affirmed that the sponsors of the 
process of the "renewal" of the legislature have not at this 
stage achieved their goals. 
  In this context the new parliament should be regarded as a 
kind of patchwork canvas, each "patch" of which is endeavoring 
to pull over to its side the whole "blanket." After all that has 
been said, it remains to analyze each fragment of this canvas 
individually. 
  It is impossible in a single newspaper article, of course, 
to 
take account of all the factors influencing the correlation of 
forces in the corps of deputies (national, religious, clan, and 
so forth). The observations offered here are merely an attempt 
to distinguish the main political and economic interests which 
will, possibly, determine the strategic course of the new 
parliament. 
<H5>  Corps of Directors of State-Owned Enterprises </H5>
  It has an objective interest in economic upturn, economic 
and 
political integration in the CIS, in securing guarantees of 
preservation of its social status in the event of a cancellation 
of the contract with the state, and in a share of the profit in 
the enterprises it manages and also in the stability and 
efficiency of legislative instruments. It is not interested in 
the proposed plan of privatization, and the majority are 
opponents of the new economic structures. For a number of 
reasons it frequently acts as a brake on the structural 
reorganization of the economy. In its endeavors it frequently 
relies on the work force of the enterprises. 
  The upper part of the corps could be temporarily neutralized 
by the transfer of part of the block of shares in the 
privatization process. But there will be no long-term 
neutralization inasmuch as the economic recession rules out 
tangible dividends on the stock and is reducing considerably the 
value of the block itself. The transition to a contract system 
of the hire of enterprise managers, the venture remuneration of 
their labor, and a guarantee of the acquisition of part of the 
block of shares of the enterprise upon fulfillment of the terms 
of the contract would make it possible to realize the interests 
of the said group sufficiently fully. The anticipated strength 
of the parliamentary lobby is approximately 25 persons. 
  It is the corps of directors (more precisely, the group 
lobbying for its interests and consisting of deputies who have 
entered parliament from large industrial structures and also 
from the scientific and technological milieu) which could in 
principle be an ally of the "irreconcilable" parliamentary 
opposition composed chiefly of deputies of the former parliament 
and novices elected from the opposition parties and movements. 
Both have an interest in the realization of an "intelligent" 
anticrisis program and, most important, in a reorientation of 
the present privatization strategy. But their ultimate goals are 
fundamentally different. The "irreconcilables" are preoccupied 
with an improvement in the political and socioeconomic 
atmosphere in the country and, ultimately, with an upturn in 
society's living standard. The corps of directors has an 
interest primarily in the political and economic defeat of the 
"holding company barons," who have seized the initiative in the 
control of the economy. 
  Nonetheless, it is the efforts of the directors' lobby in 
parliament that could create a legislative base limiting to a 
considerable extent the appetites of the national-state 
bureaucracy and placing the executive within the strict 
framework of the law. 
<H5>  Administration Chiefs </H5>
  A process of federalization of the state is actively under 
way in Kazakhstan, in an unlawful form, it is true. There are 
more than sufficient prerequisites for this process. The 
inevitable flow of command authority from the ministries to the 
administration chiefs has led to a redistribution of real power 
between the higher (central) and local bureaucracies in favor of 
the latter. It is its interests, which are today being realized 
unlawfully, that will be partially legalized by the new 
parliament in a brutal struggle with the representatives of the 
central bureaucracy. 
  "Political relaxation" of the strict dependence on the 
president, decentralization of the state budget, a diminution in 
the role of the cabinet of ministers and other central 
structures in the management of state property, and a reduction 
in the powers of the local representative authorities, control 
powers primarily, are in the interests of this group. 
Realization of these aspirations would enable the chiefs to 
acquire political hegemony with all the ensuing consequences in 
the sense of privatization of property. This group has a sizable 
lobby in the Supreme Council, on the official slate included. 
The chiefs are not interested in the establishment of a regime 
based on the rule of law but would support with pleasure the 
demands for strict supervision of the activity of the cabinet. 
They are objective supporters of the concept of a strong 
regional policy. As of today this is one of the most influential 
groupings, whose financial possibilities and degree of freedom 
are very substantial and growing constantly. The anticipated 
size of the parliamentary lobby is approximately 40 persons. 
Considering what has been said above, it may be assumed that the 
deputies from the ranks of the former chiefs and the figures 
close to them will play in the new parliament the part of Trojan 
Horse. People who in terms of their former status were duty 
bound to be loyal to the president will embark with particular 
zeal on attacking the government (which under our conditions 
means an indirect blow at the head of state). At the same time, 
on the other hand, the deputy-chiefs will be the principal 
obstacle to the "irreconcilables" in the latter's aspiration to 
consolidate the corps of deputies on all-Kazakhstan interests. 
It is by the efforts of the chiefs' lobby that parliament could 
begin a gradual drift down the stream of regionalism (which, 
incidentally, is feared in earnest at the upper levels of power). 
<H5>  State Bureaucracy </H5>
  Not only part of top government officialdom but also the 
majority of bank "generals" and the top leadership of the 
holding companies, concerns, and so forth may be attributed to 
this group. They are represented in parliament by part of the 
official slate and also the party factions of SNEK and the 
People's Congress. The continued centralization of the executive 
up to and including its "absolutization" is in the interests of 
this group. They will aspire to the maximum limitation of 
parliament's control functions, remembering the lessons of the 
Control Chamber of the former Supreme Council. It is most 
probable that this group will enjoy the tacit support of the top 
executive structures, including the top persons of the state. 
Nor is it ruled out that it is they that will try to obtain (and 
will obtain) a majority in the key parliamentary committees 
(primarily those in charge of the economy and finances), having 
supplanted the representatives of other groups. In this case 
hopes of intelligent opposition to the government's present 
economic policy are not destined to be realized. The anticipated 
strength of the parliamentary lobby is from 30 to 50 persons. 
<H5>  Middle Class </H5>
  The group with substantial capital, but lacking a sure 
outlet 
to power, is the one the worst represented in parliament. For 
this reason the middle class has in practice been sidelined from 
the redivision of property and, consequently, will lose more 
than it gains as a result of official policy. It is represented 
in parliament by deputies from the unions, the middle and petty 
commercial structures, and certain social and political 
formations. The establishment of a truly democratic, law-based 
regime, a strengthening of market institutions, and the 
assurance of tax and other privileges for the producer and, 
ultimately, a rise in the living standard of as large a part of 
society as possible are in their interests. Proceeding from 
this, we may forecast a direction of their parliamentary 
activity aimed at limitation of the omnipotence of the 
"executants," fair privatization, and a broadening of the 
political and social opportunities of all members of society. 
Aside from all else, it is the middle class that is capable, 
given support on the part of other social groups, of really 
effecting a structural reorganization of the economy consonant 
with the aims of the "irreconcilables" and the corps of 
directors. Consequently, the lobbyists of this group could count 
on the support in parliament of all the above-mentioned groups, 
other than the state bureaucracy and the administration chiefs. 
In addition, the middle class has in the new corps of deputies 
potentially outstanding leaders. If this leadership acquires 
real outlines, the forecasts concerning the 
constructive-opposition character of the new parliament would 
seem reasonably justified. We have thus logically approached a 
problem of extreme importance for this corps of deputies--the 
candidacy of the speaker. 
<H5>  Speaker </H5>
  In the context of present-day political realities there is 
no 
doubt that the person who occupies this seat will find himself 
in a difficult situation. If he fully supports the official 
course (primarily in the sphere of privatization), conflicts 
with the interests of the majority of parliamentary groups and, 
thus, the emergence of a parliamentary crisis "from within" are 
inevitable. Many observers are inclined to use this to explain 
the rumors that have arisen as of late concerning the refusal of 
the "big house" to take a chance on Kuanish Sultanov, whose 
candidacy was even recently seen as being a sure thing, 
virtually. The former vice premier himself, it would seem, is 
sincerely convinced of the soundness of the "reform" policy that 
is being pursued. Speaking on the eve of the elections in a 
northern oblast, he spoke about the reasons for the crisis as 
being objective and independent of the government and the 
president, from which it followed that struggle against the 
crisis was a secondary preoccupation. "The main thing today is 
privatization," Mr. Sultanov declared. And although this logic 
coincides in principle with the precepts of the top persons of 
the state, they have to understand that the aspiration of the 
leader of the SNEK to be "holier than the pope" would hardly 
meet with understanding on the part of the present deputies. In 
addition, account needs to be taken of the manifestly negative 
image of the SNEK, which was merely reinforced in the period of 
the election campaign. 
  Olzhas Suleymenov could be named in this category also, but 
he could be hampered by problems of a linguistic nature: the 
speaker must, according to the constitution, know the official 
language. In addition, the speaker must have a grasp of the 
economic situation, which the leader of the Kazakhstan People's 
Congress clearly lacks. But if Mr. Suleymenov decides, for all 
that, to let his name go forward, he could "draw off" onto 
himself the votes of some of the deputies, exerting a 
considerable influence on the final result. 
  Some people are inclined to speak seriously about the 
candidacy of Abish Kekilbayev, former state counselor, who 
acquired certain political capital on the Aral problem. But this 
figure, many informed people believe, enjoys far more support in 
his native west than here, in the south. And the positions of 
the southerners in this parliament are quite strong. 
  Particular meaning has come to be invested as of late in the 
"foothills" of the political Olympus in the mentions of Umirbek 
Dzholdasbekov--former dean of the Kazakhstan State University 
and president of the Engineering Academy. To his credit are, 
first, successful activity, in the view of some people, as dean 
and, second, a correct (from today's standpoints) line of 
behavior in December 1986. At the same time, on the other hand, 
his role in the successful "self-dissolution" of the former 
Supreme Council is well known (to be persuaded of this it is 
sufficient to take a look at the stenographic accounts of the 
final sittings of the 11th Session). Mr. Dzholdasbekov was not 
only a member of the so-called 11-man "action committee" but was 
also an active inspiration behind and conductor of all its 
undertakings--together with Zamanbek Kurkadilov and his 
ilk--former corps of deputy colleagues. And at the sitting on 10 
December he even delivered the report on the draft law on 
delegation of the powers of the Supreme Council to the 
president. It is notable that prior to this the academician had 
spoken at the sessions quite infrequently, and on matters of 
procedure, more often than not. Old-timers recall just two 
exceptions: the impassioned monologues of "Uncle Dzho" during 
discussion of the coat of arms (1992) and the government awards 
(1993). In the first instance, what is more, the member of 
parliament favored the central component of the attribute of 
statehood with a comparison with an intimate part of a lady's 
attire.... 
  According to the latest information, Mr. Dzholdasbekov 
recently assembled the Alma-Ata [Almaty] deputies and persuaded 
them to support the draft law "Legislative Assembly of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan" containing a provision concerning a 
bicameral parliament. Although not long before this, at a 
meeting of the working group preparing the agenda, it was 
declared that this bill would not be put to the session. It is 
perfectly probable, however, that it will, for all that, surface 
at a plenary sitting in the very near future. In any event, a 
high-ranking government official communicated to your author the 
perfectly realistic prospect of such a development of events. In 
his opinion, there is behind this the endeavor of backstage 
"scriptwriters" of the parliamentary performance to "decapitate" 
the corps of deputies according to the principle: two heads, 
hence, none. And to thereby exclude the possibility of the 
arrival on the captain's bridge of a powerful politician of an 
opposition persuasion. Gaziz Aldamzharov, cochairman of the 
Socialist Party, for example, who is known for his 
uncompromising position in the office of chairman of the Control 
Chamber of the former Supreme Council. Despite all the apparent 
ease of this maneuver, it turns on the need for an amendment to 
be made to the constitution, and the consent of two-thirds of 
the corps of deputies is necessary for its revision. Obtaining 
the latter would seem highly problematical inasmuch as the 
majority of deputies would easily read behind the prospect of 
their division into two chambers the artless scenario of a 
counterpoise of the parts of the corps of deputies to one 
another, which would signify a blocking of the legislative work 
of parliament and its virtual loss of control functions. 
Observers do not rule out the possibility of the speaker's chair 
being taken by a person around whom a majority of the opposition 
groupings examined above would consolidate. In this case very 
interesting events await us. It is even possible that the 
president would be forced to "surrender" to the deputies the 
present cabinet. And then, instead of a parliamentary crisis, we 
would be witnesses to a government crisis, whose consequences 
would be truly unpredictable.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Kabayev: "This Is Not a Conservatory for You. </F>
Everyone Is Monitored Here: Chekists in Kyrgyzia Have Started an 
Apparatus War"] 
  [Text] Bishkek--"Hello, is this the hospital? No? Then 
excuse me..." 
  What does this mean? If you are not a statesman, not an 
important businessman, or, finally, not a "hard-boiled" 
journalist, the error can be written off to lousy telephone 
communications. But if you fall into the aforementioned category 
of people, then you should think twice. 
  A special cable stretches from each of the 16 operating 
telephone stations in Bishkek to the department with three, now 
four, initials--GKNB [State Committee for National Security]. 
The KGB has its own people on each shift at the 16 stations. 
With some degree of exaggeration, the Ministry of Communications 
can be safely called a daughter of the KGB firm. 
  A note with a request to monitor one or another subscriber 
(addressed to the chairman of the KGB) is submitted by the 
manager of one of the two leading directorates of the office. 
After an appropriate endorsement, the paper is returned to the 
executor. Further--it is a matter of equipment. A ring can be 
heard at the necessary ATC [automated telephone station]: 
  "Masha (Aigul, Sveta, Larisa...), hook us up with this 
number." 
  Soon a small light shows up on a panel in a special KGB 
room--"the subscriber is on the line!" In order to determine 
whether the "object" is in place in the apartment of the person 
who is "under surveillance," the buzzer rings: "Hello, is this 
the hospital (hotel, bathhouse, kindergarten, etc.)?" The 
trustful master of the house replies indignantly that, no, this, 
he says, is an apartment... As a rule, it is here that the 
recorder is turned on with each incoming and outgoing telephone 
call. By the way, the click in the telephone receiver that is 
described in detective stories cannot be heard. The GB's [state 
security] apparatus is well balanced. Sometimes conversations 
are listened to directly. But in both cases in the apartment (or 
the office), a noticeable deterioration in sound quality occurs. 
Approval to monitor a telephone is granted for a period of not 
more than one month; however, this does not mean that the 
approval cannot be extended. According to the testimony of 
reliable persons, up to 20 subscribers are monitored in Bishkek 
each day. 
  However, the situation in an apartment (or office) can also 
be monitored without lifting the telephone receiver. In this 
case, the telephone apparatus itself acts as a microphone. 
Therefore, knowledgeable people either disconnect the apparatus 
from the system or turn on a source of additional sound (two is 
better, in different corners of the room)--a radio, a television 
set. The author of these lines frequently had occasion to be 
witness to this during conversations with highly placed Kyrgyz 
officials. 
  Notes containing approval for monitoring are supposed to be 
kept in a special archive. However, if a note is "lost" for any 
reason, the loss may not even be noticed. Thus, it has become 
known that in December of 1980, after the murder of Chairman of 
the Council of Ministers Sultan Ibraimov, several notes of 
approval and deciphering of telephone conversations of suspected 
persons disappeared. 
  With the victory of democracy in Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan], 
discussions about telephone monitoring have not diminished. 
Complaints and suspicions are coming both from governmental 
figures and also from journalists and politicians. 
  There are a lot of examples. When leaving for home Felix 
Kulov, former vice president of the state, sealed the door of 
his official office and, while talking with someone, 
disconnected the telephone apparatus from the system. Topchubek 
Turgunaliyev, head of the Erk Party, suspecting the "office" of 
monitoring his telephone, officially appealed to the head of the 
KGB-GKNB. 
  Alas, the essence of the department did not change with the 
change of signboard. Just as in the epoch of totalitarianism, 
the department continues to engage in political investigation, 
and it actively intervenes in the affairs of the state and the 
personal life of its citizens. 
  After the downfall of communism in the Baltics and Eastern 
Europe, the state security organs were the masters of the 
political Olympus for three or four years. With their assist, 
parliamentarians divided each other into "clean" and "dirty." 
The chiefs of committees removed objectionable figures from the 
political arena without particular problems. Undoubtedly, given 
all its antiespionage (read anti-state security) orientation, 
this prolonged action was managed and coordinated by departments 
that "were being criticized." It is sufficient to mention that 
after the accusations of "cooperation with the KGB," Kazimiera 
Prunskiene was forced to resign as prime minister of Lithuania. 
But who else could have arranged the compromise of the prime 
minister except the KGB? No one! The axiom says: "Divulgence of 
agent information is a matter for the hands of the department 
that put such agent network together." The intelligence services 
of Czechoslovakia were able to isolate Aleksandr Dubcek, who 
recently died in an automobile accident under strange 
circumstances. The state security people of Poland were not 
satisfied with Lech Walesa, who there and then was accused of 
cooperation with the organs. Moreover, rather convincing 
documents were leaked to the press. 
  Kyrgyzia, apparently, is also no exception.. 
  In the opinion of a number of former employees of the Kyrgyz 
KGB, the firm in one way or another controls up to half of the 
state employees and members of parliament. Some of them were and 
are secret agents, others were seen in the organs at one time 
carrying out delicate instructions of the KGB, and still others 
were driven at one time "to do the devil's work" by writing a 
denunciation against a neighbor, and the paper providently 
settled in the "office." Today (as they believe), the 
publication of three to five names that are well known in the 
republic (with a specific demonstration of their agent activity) 
is capable of causing a profound governmental and parliamentary 
crisis. 
  Getting ahead of the story, it should be noted that with 
this, apparently, these state security people have captured 
parliamentarians who are scared to death. At the last session of 
the Kyrgyz parliament the people's representatives unanimously 
passed a law concerning the organs of state security. 
  According to this law, the Chekists acquired the right of 
unimpeded entry into dwellings "and other premises belonging to 
citizens" (a reason will always be found!), and the procurator 
has to be notified of this only after 24 hours. Now state 
security people can quite informally intervene in the activity 
of commercial structures, "demand and receive from them 
necessary information, check the presence of property with 
registered and current data, and receive information in banks on 
operations, accounts, and deposits." Where is the guarantee that 
the commercial information will not be turned over (sold) to 
competitors afterwards? Where is the guarantee that the Chekists 
(and today they are graduates of Kyrgyz higher educational 
institutions who have merely gone through a Bishkek system of 
personnel selection) will not ruin the firms and organizations 
they are checking up on? After all, the law does not say a word 
about the measure of responsibility of the employees of the GKNB 
in the event of causing moral, physical, or economic damage. 
  The state security people have retained control over 
governmental special communications, they have retained for 
themselves the investigative isolation cells that just a year 
ago were filled with then "foreign money speculators," though as 
it turns out today--with legal financial brokers. Now the 
Chekists, suspecting someone (and, as is known, anyone and 
everyone can be suspected), can quite informally check the 
contents of your pockets and go through your car and personal 
things. Moreover, without the approval of a procurator. 
  Incidentally, Kyrgyz Chekists now enjoy the use of all types 
of public transport (except taxis) free of charge. 
  And more: The services of state security informers will be 
paid from the republic budget. 
  Thus, in the most democratic Central Asian republic, the 
parliamentarians not only did not restrict the activity of its 
monster, but, on the contrary, placed it above all society, 
having legalized the penetration of all spheres of Kyrgyz state, 
public, and economic life. 
  Only the president has the last word. After all, whether the 
law on state security organs passed by the deputies will be 
confirmed depends only on him. But the president is keeping 
silent. For the time being.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kh. Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State </F>
Railroad, by V. Veys, GUDOK correspondent: "The Site of the 
Meeting Is Ashkhabad"; Ashkhabad, date not given] 
  [Text] As we know, the next, 11th meeting of the 
Council for Railroad Transport of the Commonwealth Member-States 
is to be held in Ashkhabad. In connection with this, Kh. 
Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State Railroad, answers our 
correspondent's questions. 
  [Veys] What caused this decision and what is the state of 
readiness for the coming meeting? 
  [Khalykov] At the previous meeting in Voronezh, our 
railroad's proposal was accepted. It was supported by the 
government of Turkmenistan. We are preparing to receive and 
house the delegations, and wish to create for our guests the 
optimal conditions for work and leisure. The necessary 
accommodations have already been selected, and by the beginning 
of May everything will be ready to receive the delegations from 
the Commonwealth countries. 
  [Veys] What are the main problems for the participants in 
the 
meeting to discuss? 
  [Khalykov] We already have some preliminary outlines of the 
coming agenda, and they are the logical outcome of the decisions 
made at previous meetings. Most important, probably, will be the 
problem of applying a new procedure for making out transport 
documents and exacting carriage charges to transport freight in 
interstate and international service. 
  Today each administration, each road must wait for someone, 
in order for them in turn to pay their debts. But how to do this 
in a civilized manner is the problem. The well-being of more 
than just the roads -- of the commonwealth and of the countries 
themselves to whom these roads belong -- depends on the correct 
solution to it. In Voronezh, incidentally, it was decided to 
convert to making settlements in Swiss Francs and, obviously, 
the first results of the clearing operations will provide a 
great deal of practical material for those participating in the 
meeting. 
  The experts on the Council consider it quite important to 
include in the coming agenda for the meeting, questions of 
official-claim work, the application of unified norms for 
transporting freight in interstate service and the introduction 
of new locking-sealing devices. 
  [Veys] What is the position of the Turkmen government on 
setting up relations with the railroads of the Commonwealth? 
  [Khalykov] All the Council's decisions are interpreted 
positively. Right now Turkmenistan is actively developing its 
transport system. In fact, until the declaration of 
independence, our country had only spur railroad lines in the 
south and west. It is fully realistic and expedient to extend 
them in this direction, which will make it possible for 
Turkmenistan to have rail links with Iran and Turkey, and across 
them -- to other countries. Today our railroad is a member of 
the International Union of Railroads. The country's government 
has been of great service in this. 
  [Veys] Is the Turkmen state railroad under any special 
conditions, as compared with other Commonwealth roads? 
  [Khalykov] We have quite a few problems. It is particularly 
important today to develop a reliable base for rolling stock 
repair. We are seeking the possibility of manufacturing the 
basic elements of track installation and communication and 
signalization systems that are new in principle. We are also 
seeking to electrify the mainlines and acquire new diesel 
locomotives and railcars. This has been achieved to quite an 
extent through setting up warm relations with the railroads of 
the CIS countries, and with Russian and Ukrainian enterprises. 
Railroad specialists from European and Asian countries come to 
us more and more often. 
  As the previous meetings of the Council showed, concern for 
our railroad is inseparable from the problems of other 
Commonwealth mainlines. It would appear that, for their more 
successful solution on a collective basis, it is important to 
improve the Council's work in the future, as well. Until the 
meeting in Ashkhabad!

collective agricultural enterprises, state farms, village 
(farm-type) enterprises, and other goods-producers for purposes 
of sowing in 1994. A total amount of 125,000 tonnes of seeds 
have been allotted. Provision has been made for the Ukrainian 
railroads to allocate additional freight cars for loading and 
unloading seeds at the request of enterprises of oblast-level 
production associations of the grain-elevator and 
grain-processing industry without collecting fees for the 
supplemental allocation of mobile storage facilities.

<F P=106> [Interview with B.V. Demchenko, administrative head of </F>
Derzhsilhosprod, by B. Polishchuk, correspondent: "How Will We 
Sow the Fields With Spring Seeds?"] 
  [Text] 
  [Polishchuk] Borys Veniaminovych, what's the situation now 
with regard to developments on the spring fields? 
  [Demchenko] It is a complex matter. In connection with the 
fact that last autumn considerable areas were not plowed due to 
a lack of fuel, as well as shortfalls and spillages of winter 
wheat from freight cars for technical reasons, we must increase 
the sowing by a factor of 1.5 at a minimum. 
  [Polishchuk] How many hectares, in particular, must be 
resown 
in winter wheat? 
  [Demchenko] Approximately 2,600,000 hectares. That includes 
areas which were insufficiently sown last autumn. 
  [Polishchuk] What's the situation with regard to seeds? 
  [Demchenko] In my opinion, we will have no problems with 
regard to seeds for the spring sowing. We need 2 million tonnes 
of them; the farms already have 1,788,000 tonnes; and 
approximately 300,000 tonnes of such seeds will be released from 
the state reserves. 
  [Polishchuk] But the farms are entering upon the springtime 
period with empty cash-boxes. 
  [Demchenko] We have taken that into account, and several 
variant solutions have been proposed. If the grain-products 
system owes a particular farm money for grain that the latter 
sold to it last year, such a farm will be able to obtain seeds 
by way of a mutually agreed-upon procedure. Provisions have been 
made to loan seeds at a certain interest rate, payable after the 
crop has been harvested. And if a particular farm has money of 
its own, it can simply buy seeds. 
  [Polishchuk] But what about prices? Won't it be the case 
that 
a farm sold a tonne of wheat last year for 500,000 krb 
[karbovantsy], but now it will have to pay triple that amount 
for an equivalent number of seeds? 
  [Demchenko] The prices are tolerable. A tonne of seeds for 
spring crops will have a price ranging from 1.5 to 2 million krb. 
  [Polishchuk] And what about corn seeds? Because, of course, 
a 
great deal of land will also be planted in this crop. 
  [Demchenko] It was planned to sow 1.5 million hectares in 
this grain crop. But it is now clear from all the evidence in 
connection with the spillage losses of winter wheat that we will 
have to sow 1.8 million hectares in corn--that plus 3 million 
hectares for silage. Therefore, there will be a total of 4.8 
million hectares sown in corn. With regard to seeds there is--so 
to speak--good news and bad news. As a whole, there are enough 
corn seeds in Ukraine. We need 120,000 tonnes of them, and the 
state reserves contain 125,000 tonnes. It is stored and can be 
delivered to various sites in accordance with the following 
procedure: Whoever has the means to buy corn seeds can do so. 
For example, more than 10,000 tonnes from the Cherkassy region 
and 7,500 tonnes from the Vinnitsa region. The terms of 
agreement are the same as for the spring-wheat seeds: sales, 
mutually agreed upon considerations, or loans. Agreement has 
been reached with the railroads about providing freight cars. 
  [Polishchuk] But why did you say that there is also some 
"bad 
news"? 
  [Demchenko] There are two things that I'm afraid of. First, 
that we may not collect these seeds rapidly enough. Spring is 
already knocking on our door. And second: that a great deal of 
harm may be done to us by a kind of selfish provincialism. This 
already happened last year, when certain farmers sold to foreign 
countries a portion of the corn seeds which had been distributed 
to them by our state. At present corn seeds are primarily 
located in seven oblasts. Let me repeat that there are enough of 
them for all Ukraine. But some persons may be tempted again by 
the lure of easy money, even though here in our country the 
price of a tonne of corn seed is really quite decent--ranging 
from 15 to 18 million krb. We must clearly inform people as 
follows: Ukraine anticipates a difficult year in agriculture and 
in the economy as a whole; it would be a sin to complicate 
matters even more than they already are.

  [Text] Upon the orders of the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers 110,000 tonnes of seeds for spring grain crops have 
been allotted from state reserves for distribution to the 
government of the Crimean Republic, as well as to oblast-level 
state administrations for release in the form of loans to

<F P=106> [Article by S. Shandar, correspondent: "Superfluous </F>
Plant-Breeders?"] 
  [Text] Because they failed to pay their electric bills on 
time the production sections of the Plant-Breeding and Genetic 
Institute had their power shut off by the Odessa Electric-Power 
Company. Unstable financing had driven the creators of new 
strains and hybrids of agricultural crops into an impasse. The 
production requirements are scarcely half-met, and the earnings 
of the institute's staffers are extremely low. 
  This situation could be rectified somewhat if various 
agricultural enterprises were to pay back to the institute the 
approximately 2 billion krb [karbovantsy] owed in debts, and if 
the institute managed to sell some 4,000 choice varieties of 
seeds for spring crops. Such seeds, which used to be snapped up 
instantly, are now lying idle because the state has no money 
with which to buy them. 
  The scientists, who have been brought to a halt by the 
above-mentioned lack of funds, have been forced to gather up 
their own research and plant-breeding work and seek out ways to 
exist within commercial structures, as well as in other states. 
Over the course of the last few months close to 40 scientific 
and technical staffers have left the institute. Doctor of 
Agricultural Sciences V.D. Navolotskyy has also submitted his 
resignation. He is a prominent plant-breeder, whose varieties of 
barley are being grown on an area of approximately 5 million 
hectares in our country and abroad. Veniamin Dmytrovych will be 
working in Russia, where he will be paid several times what he 
used to make here in Ukraine....

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Hruzdeyev, administrative head, Ministry </F>
of Agriculture and Food, by B. Polishchuk, correspondent: "Let's 
Honor and Respect Spring Wheat"] 
  [Text] 
  [Polishchuk] Have the predictions regarding the need to 
resow 
winter wheat over considerable areas been confirmed? 
  [Hruzdyevev] Yes, they have. We must resow winter wheat on 
2,300,000 hectares and perform supplementary sowing on 339,000 
hectares. That represents one-third of the areas involved. 
  [Polishchuk] And how does that compare with last year? 
  [Hruzdeyev] Twice as many tracts were dropped as occurred 
last. This is particularly true in Nikolayev, Odessa, and 
Kherson oblasts, where 45-63 percent of the appropriate areas 
must be resown in winter wheat. At many sites it did not sprout 
during the autumn because of the drought, or it was damaged by 
frosts, as was also the case in the Sumy, Poltava, Zaporozhye, 
Kharkov, Donets, and Crimean regions. 
  [Polishchuk] With what crops do you plan to resow? 
  [Hruzdeyev] Basically with barley, oats, peas, corn, millet, 
rye, and sorghum. Such operations are already widely underway in 
the southern oblasts. 
  [Polishchuk] Viktor Hryhorovych, at the very beginning of 
spring last year our newspaper brought up the matter of the 
underestimation for extreme situations of spring wheat as an 
insurance crop. It was a matter of expanding the areas to be 
sown in that crop in a year of mass resowings so as to 
compensate in case there was a shortage of grain for making 
bread and pasta-type products. Was there some movement in this 
regard? 
  [Hruzdeyev] There was. This past year more than 22,000 
hectares were sown in spring wheat. 
  [Polishchuk] This year--as they say--even God has commanded 
that the grain reserves be filled to overflowing. 
  [Hruzdeyev] Yes. There is a clearly manifested tendency to 
expand the area sown in spring wheat. Whereas formerly there 
were some farmers who were quite dissatisfied with its varieties 
because of a low crop yield, nowadays there are several 
varieties of spring wheat which have a high yield. Among these 
are, for example, Kharkov-15, Kharkov-16, Kharkov-37, and a 
number of others. In testing fields they have produced 45-50 
quintals of grain per hectare. 
  [Polishchuk] Does Ukraine have a large enough supply of 
spring wheat seeds for the present sowing? 
  [Hruzdeyev] There are enough seeds to sow this crop over a 
larger area than last year. They are kept principally in state 
reserves and in the system of seed farms under the Institute of 
Vegetation, Plant Breeding, and Genetics imeni V. Yuryev, which 
is located in Kharkov. A certain quantity of such seeds could be 
made available subsequently by the Ukrayina Experimental Farm, 
which is located in the Myronivskyy Rayon in the Kiev Region. 
Its farms, which were already engaged in studying spring wheat 
last year, now have these seeds. 
  It's important to bear in mind that the value of spring 
wheat 
consists not merely in filling up the grain reserves when and if 
there is a reduction in the area sown in winter wheat. At 
present spring wheat seeds are also valuable--so to speak--as a 
kind of national currency. At one time Ukraine's services, in 
particular, those of the Kharkov plant-breeders, were utilized 
to good advantage by entire regions of the former Soviet Union. 
With the latter's disintegration, the demand for spring wheat 
seeds at first declined, but now it is abruptly increasing. 
There are many requests from the near abroad. If we had enough 
of these seeds, we would not have to beg for fuel. We could 
exchange one commodity for the other. 
  [Polishchuk] And so we ought to apologize to spring wheat 
and 
accord it the honor and respect that it has come to deserve. Is 
that what you mean? 
  [Hruzdeyev] I certainly do. We have to calculate everything 
and not give in to extremes. If we do, the mistakes we make 
could take years to overcome.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Fields of Spring"] </F>
  [Text] This year work in the fields began almost 10 days 
earlier than it did last year. The sowing of perennial grasses 
is now being finished up. Among the first to succeed in this 
task were farms located in the Crimean Republic, as well as in 
Volyn, Zhitomir, Zakarpat, Zaporozhye, Lvov, and Nikolayev 
oblasts. 
  Because of the lack of mineral fertilizers--the present 
demand for them is being satisfied only to the extent of 17 
percent--the vitalization of winter crops has been restricted. 
  Winter crops have been resown on 1,013,400 hectares, 
including grains and legumes on 939,400 hectares. According to 
the latest data, the area of ruined winter crops will reach 2.5 
million hectares. 
  The Crimean Republic, as well as Odessa, Nikolayev, Kherson, 
Zakarpat, and Chernigov oblasts have successfully coped with the 
tasks of sowing early spring crops and resowing winter ones. 
  Work has begun on sowing sugar beets, in which close to 1.5 
million hectares have been planted. Taking part in this work 
have been farms in the Vinnitsa, Odessa, Chernigov, Nikolayev, 
Cherkassy, and Kiev regions.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Lykhovoy: "The Dried-Up Channels Will Be </F>
Filled With Water, Won't They?"] 
  [Text] Not so long ago we celebrated the opening of 
the clearing house at the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine], after 
which the directors of the NBU stated (as they continue to state 
nowadays) that the Ukrainian system of making electronic 
payments is deserving of important attention and that it has no 
peers among other similar systems. After a short time, however, 
it started to snow, and here and there the negative aspects of 
the electronic transfer system began to be noticed. Therefore, 
in order to shed some light on interbank electronic accounting 
and accounting in general, let's profit from the commentary on 
this matter by the NBU's deputy chairman of the board, Oleksandr 
Kyreyev. 
  The Ukrainian system of electronic payments comprises a 
system of channels which need to be filled with water--that is 
to say, with money--in order for movement to be observed there. 
Money is not lacking--and the channels have dried up. How is 
money to be made? As of now, the conditions are not favorable 
for economic entities to trade: The longer that items can be 
kept in storage warehouses, the more favorable it will be to 
sell. Other factors ruining the payment system include an 
essential barrier in accounting operations between 
enterprises--payment in kind (this occurs particularly in rural 
areas and may be seen when you drive through Ukraine: Bila 
Tserkva is surrounded by tires, Novomoskovsk--by pans, the 
Vinnytsa and Cherkassk regions--by sacks of sugar, which people 
have received in lieu of payment and which they want to sell). 
And until monetary operations have been normalized at the 
enterprise level, until we succeed in raising money for unsold 
products, and until we turn around the postponed "grain" 
credits, there can be no talk of the normal operation of a 
system of electronic payments. The disease of "dried-up 
channels" cannot be overcome by purely banking measures. 
  The National Bank was hardly able to stand up under the 
storm 
of criticism that was evoked by the prohibition of a debit 
balance. But: in the first ten days of February five banks went 
bankrupt (Blagobank, Ekomedbank, Universalbank, Niva, and 
Olevskyy); at present there is another bank which is on the 
brink of closing down. Information about the above-mentioned 
bankruptcies spread at the speed of sound, and many banks having 
free access to the debit wire began to throw their own debts 
onto the bankrupt banks. The latter, thereby, closed down with 
very large debts. On one occasion we managed to trace the path 
taken by a certain sum of money: In the space of a single day 
this money turned up in five different banks and was shifted 
across two oblasts. And so, taking into consideration the fact 
that electronic payments are extremely fast, the NBU decreed the 
following: A commercial bank must first recognize a demand made 
by another commercial ban, and then pay whatever is necessary. 
Other payments must be put on hold. 
  At present the commercial banks are complaining particularly 
about correspondence-type accounts introduced by the National 
Bank. They say that they cannot conduct accounts this way. But 
we have already been living for a long time under the conditions 
of a nonmonolithic banking system. Indeed, five or six years ago 
there was in effect a system of interbranch turnover or 
circulation whereby money was only calculated on the accounts of 
the enterprises involved, but the actual payment would take 
place in the bank accounts themselves. Nowadays, when numerous 
commercial banks have begun to handle their own accounts and 
clear their own money, the National Bank--as the sole 
currency-emission center--is insisting that the commercial banks 
pay for its account, for the state's account, as--in the final 
analysis the taxpayer. Why can commercial banks carry out 
currency emissions in their own names when they do not agree 
upon the volume of such emissions? And if a commercial bank 
complains that a debit or negative balance does not allow it to 
make payments or pay from clearing accounts, that means that 
such a bank is finished as a bank: The money received from 
customers has gone into credits, and the customer-depositors 
cannot conduct transactions or even obtain ready cash. That is 
to say, if a bank is capable of performing only the third of its 
three basic functions (servicing cash-type savings accounts, 
clearing services, and handling credits), can it be called a 
complete bank? Or is it not a bank at all? There are quite 
enough such institutions among our banks. 
  However, many bankers have justifications for their 
behavior. 
To be sure, how can they support the liquidation of they own 
banks if--during the hectic period of this year--they have 
approved credits to the state, and the latter was subsequently 
unable to settle their accounts? The problem of paying back the 
credits could bring about the next banking crisis inasmuch as 
the "grain" and "sugar" money already deposited at the new 
prices for these goods to be purchased by the rural areas has 
not yet been paid back. No matter what measures may be taken 
within the framework of the new payments system--Oleksandr 
Kyreyev emphasizes--they will not yield a positive result 
without a complex of state actions regarding the stabilization 
of the economy. 
  According to Mr. Kyreyev, the National Bank has not rescued 
any type of account; it has merely designated certain 
technological changes. All types of accounts are operative. But 
of those that we have happily mastered, the most effective forms 
of handing accounts are the systems of payment deliveries via 
electronic mail (which includes checks, letters of credit, and 
everything else), and the most handy and recommended form of 
handling accounts at present is payment delivery.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Onenko: "A Great Ministerial Secret: Many </F>
Oblasts Lack Corn Seeds"] 
  [Text] In the Sumy region a very large area--155,000 
hectares--has been set aside for corn; but the sowing is 
threatened with disruption. 
  "Never before have our farms been hit by such a crisis-type 
situation," laments V. Miroshnyk, duty chief of the oblast-level 
Agricultural and Food Administration. "In former years corn 
seeds were already in the storehouses of our farms as early as 
March. But this year such seeds have not even been brought to 
the grain-product combines. Moreover, they are skinning us alive 
for these seeds--ranging from 23 to 33 million karbovantsy per 
tonne, which is almost double what was recently promised in your 
newspaper by the responsible staffers of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food. Although the former State Committee on 
Grain Products was absorbed by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food, we have not yet sensed any improvement in the operation of 
its structures. All through the winter the department kept 
referring to the lack of money for the purpose of buying seeds. 
Now that credits have been allotted, the banks are playing 
tricks. But we still need to have more than 5,000 tonnes of 
seeds delivered from the southern region to our farms. If such a 
pace of solving this problem continues, we will not be able to 
start sowing corn until it is already harvest time...." 
  The supply of corn seeds is also quite small on the farms of 
Lvov, Chernigov, Ivano-Frankovsk, Rovno, Zhitomir, Khmelnitskiy, 
and other oblasts. 
  I tried to obtain an explanation of this situation from the 
chief of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food's Grain-Elevator 
Administration, B. Slyvchak, but he merely made the following 
statement: "I will not talk to you without orders from my 
superiors. That's the way we do things here...." 
  After some time I came to understand the reason for such 
strict secrecy with regard to the holdup in the delivery of corn 
seeds to our country's farms. This important work has collapsed 
with a resounding crash, even though on paper everything would 
seem to be just fine. Back on 27 January the Cabinet of 
Ministers issued an order with regard to delivering corn seeds 
to farms. It is written therein who are to obtain such sowing 
material, as well as how much, and from which oblasts; 
appropriate tasks were also assigned to Ukrainian railroads. 
However, by the beginning of April none of the kind persons 
responsible for this matter had so much as lifted a finger to 
help. The leading officials of the Main Administration for Grain 
Products under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food cite the 
fact that there was no money for mutually agreeable settlements 
among the grain-receiving enterprises. But they are all within 
the system of a single department. Is is really possible that 
they could not find a compromise-type, variant--as was 
frequently done in previous years--for conveying corn seeds from 
the southern oblats to the western and northern regions? 
  Just a few days ago the government resolved the matter of 
allotting credits to the grain-receiving enterprises. Some 1.3 
trillion karbovantsy were granted. But this is a mere drop in 
the bucket because this money was earmarked not only for 
purchasing seeds, but also to pay for grain, flour, and groats. 
  Unfortunately, even these crumbs cannot positively bring 
about a solution to the task at hand; the banks in the various 
oblasts are holding up monetary payments from the accounts 
because of miscalculations therein. 
  But even if this obstacle--one artificially created by the 
bankers--is overcome, there is another obstacle lurking around 
the bend--that of the railroads. The latter are demanding 
payment up front before they will provide the necessary freight 
cars. 
  An impasse-type situation has evolved here: The 
grain-receiving enterprises do not have the right to take a 
single karbovanets from the allotted credits, whereas there is 
nothing but wind blowing through their own accounts. For 
example, a few days ago the leading officials of the Nikolayev 
Elevatorzernoprom Associationsent a telegram to the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food, informing the latter that all the 
enterprises of this association had gone bankrupt. Now the 
grain-receiving oblasts of most oblasts are also in the same 
financial jam. What will happen? One cannot carry tens of 
thousands of tonnes of grain on one's own back.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Shandar, correspondent: "It's Already Time </F>
for Sowing, But Sunflower Seeds are Still in Storage Facilities"] 
  [Text] The apricot trees have begun to bloom, and that is a 
sure sign that it's time to sow sunflowers. But their seeds are 
not being bought by collective and state agricultural 
enterprises, nor by private farmers: They simply do not have the 
money to do that. Approximately 60 tonnes of such seeds are in 
the storage facilities of the Kholmskyy and Hlavan KSP's 
[collective agricultural enterprises] in Artsyzkyy Rayon and 
other farms, which have been growing the Odessa 122, Odessa 123, 
and Odessa 249 hybrids from the Plant-Breeding and Genetic 
Institute on a contractual basis. There are enough seeds here to 
sow 12,000 hectares. On some collective and state agricultural 
enterprises located in Zaporozhye, Poltava, and Lugansk oblasts 
the persons in charge intend to sow their fields with random 
varieties and hybrids, while keeping their own high-quality, 
enhanced hybrid varieties in storage facilities. The 
agricultural producers have been compelled to knowingly take the 
path of a shortfall in the harvest by from four to five quintals 
per hectare. That is the added amount of the yield from the 
hybrids from the Plant-breeding and Genetic Institute in Odessa. 
  An even more alarming situation is evolving with regard to 
the native forms of hybrids stored in sections here. The 
Plant-Breeding and Genetic Institute has received requests to 
obtain 50 tonnes of such seeds, but only about 10 tonnes have 
been purchased. These will be enough to sow no more than 2,000 
hectares within a total need for 10,000 hectares. 
  "Because of this situation," says Doctor of Biological 
Sciences V. Burlov, chief of the Institute's Plant-Breeding and 
Vegetable-Oil Crops Section, "as early as next year Ukraine will 
not have enough high-yield, high-quality hybrid seeds for 
commercial sowings." 
  Therefore, we could be faced with a situation 
whereby--because of our present-day poverty and 
short-sightedness--we will be without vegetable oil as early as 
next year. In order to prevent this from happening, staffers of 
the Plant-Breeding and Genetic Institute, along with its choice 
seed organizations, are proposing that farms and private farmers 
accept seeds on credit. This would be in exchange--on the basis 
of mutually agreeable conditions--for a portion of the crop 
after it is harvested. In particular, they would agree that the 
agricultural producers--in exchange for the hybrids obtained 
from them--would give them 100-120 kilograms of seeds from each 
hectare 0f sowings. The advantages to be gained by the farmers 
and private farmers from this arrangement are obvious. Because 
certainly the additional yield from the Odessa hybrids is 
substantial, and the oils derived from them is much higher than 
that obtained from random varieties and hybrids. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture and Food must also pay heed and 
concern itself with solving this extremely important problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Vardan Petrosyan: "A Capricious Guarantor of </F>
Legality"] 
  [Text] On 5 April, already for the third time in the last 
year and a half, the people's court of Spandaryanskiy Rayon 
attempted to start the trial of the ARF [Armenian Revolutionary 
Federation] Dashnaktsutyun [Union] versus Levon Ter-Petrosyan; 
however, the attempt failed in view of the failure of the 
defendant--citizen of the Republic of Armenia Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan--or his representatives to appear in court. Of 
course, we are not at all inclined to assume that the president 
of the republic was not informed by the appropriate authorities 
that this was the third attempt to try the case. Such an 
assumption would simply look naive. Something else causes 
concern--L. Ter-Petrosyan, using his status as president, is 
being guided by the psychology of a person who is free of any 
kind of responsibility, and not by the logic of a leader who is 
building a rule-of-law state. But the time of monarchs has 
passed, and today's president may not be tomorrow's president. 
What will defend him before the law then? The belated sympathy 
of the people? Hardly... The citizens of some other country? 
Possibly... However, there is still time before one of these 
situations arises, and we should give some thought to realities. 
And think out loud, inasmuch as what evokes our concern today 
should without fail to arouse the concern of all our countrymen. 
After all, under the slogans of building a rule-of-law state and 
affirming the principles of democracy, violations of the law are 
being committed before our very eyes, including also on the part 
of the president of the republic, who, in accordance with the 
presidential oath, should be the symbol and guarantor of 
democracy and legality in our country. But perhaps our 
conclusions are hasty? 
  "Perhaps, as a matter of fact, the president does not yet 
want to 'squander his gifts on trifles,' perhaps it is still too 
early to talk about the lack of arguments," citizens of the 
republic and his former admirers and comrades in arms might 
think, possibly desiring to preserve the last memory of their 
trust in the president. Possibly, they have the right to cherish 
their last hope, but for every more or less experienced person 
this question was closed long ago, as if it had not existed at 
all. Among these are people who are sufficiently informed of the 
history of the ARF Dashnaktsutyun, and, consequently, also about 
Dashnaktsutyun moral principles, and also those who in the last 
five years have succeeded in sufficiently recognizing the value 
of the words and deeds of the present authorities (headed by the 
president). In particular, with the help of the latest mutual 
exposures and self-exposures of the president's closest circle. 
  At the end of his television speech on 29 June 1992 the 
president declared his readiness to present the pertinent facts 
and justify the accusations raised in his speech against the 
Dashnaktsutyun and its representatives, if... the "accused 
party" calls for the legal answerability of the president. It 
was already evident in those days that the real aim of the 
president's speech was to influence the psychology of the 
masses, to dispose them against Dashnaktsutyun and, by obtaining 
the silent consent of a majority of the people, to make short 
work of the party. The president, not having the legal grounds 
to carry out his plan, intended to make use of the support of 
the crowd. 
  The ARF Dashnaktsutyun accepted the president's challenge, 
because not to accept it would mean, in fact, concurring with 
the declared accusations, especially because it was already 
apparent, as it is apparent now, that these accusations have no 
factual basis and that what has happened is just an 
anachronistic political "farce" undertaken for the purpose of 
diverting the attention of the people and the opposition from 
the main problems. 
  Any political party, or any political figure, especially the 
president of the republic, should be well aware that their words 
and deeds should be calculated not for one day and not even for 
one year, if, of course, they do not intend to limit their 
activity to such a short period. They must also not forget, of 
course, that people can be deluded for a certain time, but no 
one has been able to do this for a long time, and especially 
continuously. And if anyone tries to be guided by a different 
logic, this will sooner or later reveal itself, it will reveal 
itself, and it will turn against them. 
  This very same logic in our country lies at the basis of 
actions and resolutions on national questions; therefore it 
should be no surprise that those guilty of political terrorism 
are not being exposed, or that those who are exposed are not 
punished. The behavior of the authorities on many questions has 
boomeranged against them. For example, many are openly evading 
service in the army. No matter how reprehensible this phenomenon 
is; nevertheless, there are definite reasons for this, and we 
will not be wrong if we say that first among them is the bad 
example set for the population by the authorities, in particular 
by the president himself. It is now obvious that the watershed 
in the mutual relations of the people and the authorities 
continues to deepen, which in these decisive days can lead only 
to extremely dangerous consequences. These are questions which 
every Armenian should ponder seriously, especially the president 
of the republic.

  [Text] The activity of the Ministry of Industry of the 
Republic of Armenia and the Ministry of Light Industry of the 
Republic of Armenia in 1993 was the main item on the agenda of 
the meeting of the presidium of the Government of the Republic 
of Armenia held on 16 April under the chairmanship of Prime 
Minister Grant Bagratyan. A report on the results of the 
activity of the two ministries, presented by Minister of 
Economic Affairs of the Republic of Armenia Armen Yegiazaryan, 
noted that the volume of industrial production produced by 
enterprises of the Ministry of Industry in 1993 amounts to 99.5 
percent of the volume produced in 1992 and 74.3 percent of the 
volume planned for 1993. For enterprises of the Ministry of 
Light Industry, this volume amounts to 89.4 percent and 66.2 
percent respectively. 
  In presenting the big picture of the activity of his 
department, Minister of Industry of the Republic of Armenia 
Ashot Safaryan paid particular attention to problems of 
stabilization of the economy and strengthening positions on the 
international market. Of 168 enterprises of the ministry, 94 
enterprises provided the level of the previous year. In 1993 
industrial enterprises adopted 417 new product designations and 
numerous new technologies. 
  In his report, Minister of Light Industry of the Republic of 
Armenia Rudolf Teymurazyan emphasized the introduction of 
advanced and energy-saving technologies. Of 134 light industry 
enterprises, 57 were able to provide the level of the previous 
year. Work is being done at 22 industry enterprises on uniforms 
and insignia for subunits of the National Army. 
  In the process of the exchange of opinions that unfolded 
after listening to the reports, the activities of the ministries 
were in general considered satisfactory. But at the same time 
some serious deficiencies and miscalculations were noted. It was 
recommended that special attention be paid to work on the 
establishment of reliable transportation systems and 
infrastructures.

<F P=106> [Article: "Volume of Migration in Latvia Has Declined"] </F>
  [Text] The Latvian State Statistics Committee has compiled 
data and performed an analysis on the migration of inhabitants 
in Latvia in 1993. It shows that migration in the last year, in 
comparison with previous years, has declined. The number of 
inhabitants of the Republic of Latvia, according to inter-nation 
migration, has declined in 1993 by about 28 thousand people. The 
total volume of inter-nation migration (the total number of 
persons who have entered and those who have left Latvia as a 
place of permanent residence) in the last year, in comparison 
with 1992, declined by 39 percent, with emigration declining 
more rapidly -- by 39.6 percent, than immigration -- by 32.5 
percent. 
  The decline in both immigration and emigration volume is 
attributed to the flow of immigration to our neighboring 
countries of Lithuania and Estonia, and especially to the CIS. 
Immigration from the CIS countries in 1993 declined by 38.2 
percent, while emigration to these -- by 41 percent. Emigration 
from Latvia to western countries in 1993 continued at the same 
volume as for the previous year -- 2,487 persons in 1992, and 
2,319 persons in 1993. Emigration from Latvia to western 
countries continues to be almost 8 times greater than 
immigration from these. 
  The greatest effect of migration is the decline in the 
number 
of inhabitants of Latvia's largest cities of Riga, Liepaja, and 
Daugavpils, which could be considered as a positive result, and 
also in the rayons of Bauska, Cesis, Ogre and Preili. A positive 
migration balance in 1993 was found in the city of Rezekne and 
in the rayons of Rezekne, Kuldiga, Ludza and Balvi. But during 
this time period, no positive migration balance from abroad was 
registered for any of the cities or rayons of Latvia. 
  Statistical data show that the number of Latvians in cities 
continues to decline as a result of migration: in 1992 by 4.5 
thousand, while in 1993, by 1.4 thousand. This indicates that 
Latvian families, for various reasons, are relocating to live in 
rural areas.

<F P=106> [Article by Martins Kibilds: "`Accord' to Split into Two </F>
Factions"] 
  [Text] Riga, March 18. Today, the board of the People's 
Accord Party, which had been led by Janis Jurkans, adopted a 
resolution on the creation of separate Saeima factions. 
Saturday, the other "Accord" group of deputies -- the Economists 
Union, led by Edvins Kide, will hold a founding meeting, which 
will likewise resolve to create its faction. 
  Next week, J.Jurkans and his followers will sign a statement 
announcing the formation of the faction and present it to the 
Saeima Board of Officers. Accordingly, already next week, in 
place of the current faction Accord for Latvia, there will be 
two independent factions in the Saeima. 
  The People's Accord Party (PAP) faction will have four 
deputies -- J. Jurkans (faction chairman), Ludmila Kuprijanova, 
Igors Bukovskis and Andris Ameriks. The founding document of the 
Economists Union (EU) faction was signed by seven deputies -- E. 
Kide (chairman of the former Accord faction and, apparently, of 
the new faction), Vilnis Bresis, Irene Folkmane, Juris Janeks, 
Janis Lucans, Leonards Stass, and Jevgenijs Zascerinskis. Two 
deputies -- Ernests Jurkans and Eriks Kaza, who, in their 
voting, have not infrequently shown their support for the ruling 
coalition, have not joined with any of the potential factions 
for now, but if they do join, it will probably be the PAP. 
  The first signs of a split in the election union of Accord 
for Latvia -- Rebirth of the Economy, which shortened its name 
in the Saeima to Accord for Latvia (AL), were already evident in 
the fall of last year. 
  Differences in the viewpoints of the factions did not permit 
the formation of a unified political party, although the AL 
deputies promised that they would remained united at least in 
the Saeima. Even though both sides are still keeping alive the 
idea of the formation of a united voting bloc, which would be 
permissible in accordance with the Saeima's rules of order, 
neither of the sides is exhibiting any particular enthusiasm. 
  "We could create something similar to the National bloc, but 
we can already see that the effect of such a bloc is doubtful," 
admitted J. Jurkans in a conversation with DIENA. When the other 
leader -- E. Kide, was asked whether the formation of the bloc 
was a reality, he told DIENA: "We will take a look at the other 
side's position. At present, such a development is not out of 
the question". 
  The main reasons for the split according to J. Jurkans were 
the other side's inconsistent policies, the realization of the 
pre-election program, and he was particularly embittered about 
E. Kide joining the ruling coalition in the projected 
citizenship law. E. Kide, in turn, is more at ease and feels 
that there are no main differences in opinion between PAP and 
EU, although their programs differ primarily in "nuances". He 
does admit, however, that these "nuances" do not permit the 
Accord unity to exist. 
  Despite the split of the third largest faction in the 
Saeima, 
which is the first largest since the election, the overall 
political picture in the parliament will not change -- and both 
J. Jurkans and E. Kide are in agreement on this. Neither of the 
new factions sees any reason to change its present viewpoint and 
show more favor towards the ruling coalition.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Randers: "First Professional Official Starts </F>
Working for State] 
  [Text] Today marks one week since the Cabinet of 
Ministers confirmed the position of the first professional 
official -- INDULIS TUPESIS was named State Civil Service 
Administration Chief. In January, he moved from the United 
States to live in Latvia permanently, and will be the person 
who, within the so-called reform program for officials, will 
organize the certification of all officials (approximately 30 
thousand, in total) -- the first step toward the creation of a 
staff of professional officials, because, until now, it seems 
that the officials employed here have only been amateurs. 
  At present, the new Chief of the Civil Service is compiling 
a 
list of positions for all state ministry officials, which will 
then be reviewed and confirmed by the Cabinet of Ministers. As 
soon as the Saeima adopts the law "On the State Civil Service" 
(at present, it has only been adopted in the first reading), the 
commission set up by I. Tupesis and confirmed by the Cabinet of 
Ministers will start the certification of Latvia's officials. 
  The very first to be certified will be the state secretaries 
of the ministries (for example, the State Secretary of the 
Ministry of Agriculture is J. Lapse). Those who pass the 
certification examination (first, a questionnaire to determine 
whether the applicant meets the requirements as prescribed by 
law, second, an essay, and third, a conversation or "interview") 
will be granted a standing as candidate for official, which will 
give them the right to receive an increase in salary. In order 
for a candidate to become a professional official, the applicant 
will have to complete several years of studies at the newly 
established State Administrative School. 
  The State Civil Service Board reports to the Ministry of 
Reforms. As I. Gailis, the Minister of Reforms told LAUKU AVIZE, 
I. Tupesis was named chief of the board as a result of a 
competition held by the Ministry. While I. Tupesis, as a 
Latvian from exile, has one drawback -- a temporarily poor 
understanding of local conditions -- with his knowledge and 
experience (for 20 years, he has worked in the Civil Service of 
the United States in America, Europe and Japan), he has still 
managed to surpass the local applicants for this responsible 
position. 
  I. Tupesis is 43 years old. He came to Latvia for the first 
time in October of last year, and at that time decided to 
relocate here permanently. He is a dual citizen of Latvia and 
the United States of America. His last place of employment in 
the United States was Director of Contracts for the Naval 
Regional Contract Center in Washington. He has received his 
education from the Munster Latvian High School, the universities 
of Wisconsin and California, the Kennedy School of Government, 
the United States civil service administration's higher 
education institute in Virginia (the main topic of studies -- 
how to deal with staffs of officials in a democratic country). 
He is fluent in English and Latvian, and has some knowledge of 
German and Italian. 
  In contrast to his brother, Saeima deputy Janis Tupesis (he 
has another brother, who works in the United States civil 
service, and a sister, who teaches English in Poland), Indulis 
is not considering a political career in Latvia. The civil 
service law will contain the regulation that an official cannot 
be a member of any party, work in a side position, accept a post 
in a state or private business organization, -- and the first 
professional official in the state must set the example.

<F P=106> [Article by Ilya Lotkin under the rubric "On the Other </F>
Side": "Siberians Take Care of the Kindred Folk"] 
  [Text] Omsk--Reports on the aggravation of interethnic 
tension in Northern Kazakhstan have recently been published in 
the mass media of the city of Omsk with both a progovernment and 
oppositional orientation. Directive No. 31 of the minister of 
justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which suspended the 
operation and revoked the registration of all Russian 
communities in that country, was the reason for the above. This 
caused an extremely negative reaction in Omsk and spawned a new 
surge of territorial claims against Kazakhstan. In particular, 
the article of S. Suprunyuk, chairman of the Duma of the North 
Kazakhstan Oblast Russian Community entitled "...And Then the 
Nation Loses" (OMSKOE VREMYA, No. 3, 1994) plays on the 
historical fact that until 1921, Petropavlovsk was an uyezd seat 
within Omsk Gubernia, and that until 1936 all of Northern 
Kazakhstan was a part of the RSFSR with an autonomous status. 
However, specific facts cited in the newspaper--the breaking up 
of the republic-wide conference of the Slavic cultural society 
Lad in Pavlodar and the Cossack circle in Petropavlovsk by the 
authorities of Kazakhstan, as well as judicial prosecution and 
the ban on the Russian-language newspapers ZNAMYA SVOBODY, GLAS, 
and VOZNESENSKIY PROSPEKT in North Kazakhstan Oblast--testify to 
infringements of the rights of the Russian population in 
Northern Kazakhstan that have actually occurred. 
  The local oppositional press has published a declaration of 
the deputy faction Russian Way of the Russian Federation State 
Duma (Yu. Vlasov, S. Baburin, A. Lukyanov, and others). In 
particular, the declaration says: "The Russian way in 
interethnic relations means bringing back the relationship of 
friendship and fraternity among all peoples populating an 
ethnically diverse Russia, removing all obstacles to the 
development of national culture, language, and educational 
system...Russia as a united, genuinely federated state which 
consistently translates into life the norms of the Federation 
Treaty...Russia as the main attracting force for the recreation 
of a new, voluntary unity of peoples residing in the territory 
of the erstwhile USSR." 
  Against the background of these events, the formation of the 
Siberian Cossack Host out of various Cossack societies that 
recently occurred in Omsk will create an unpredictable and 
explosive situation in our region; the Host will soon become a 
component of the Siberian Military District. If emergency 
measures are not taken, after a certain period of time Omsk and 
Kurgan Oblasts of Russia, as well as Pavlodar and Northern 
Kazakhstan Oblasts of Kazakhstan may become the zone of a 
broad-scale interethnic conflict. As I see it, a way out of the 
existing situation is found in forming a united economic space 
out of Omsk, Kurgan, and Tyumen Oblasts of Russia and Northern 
Kazakhstan Oblast of Kazakhstan, even more so because the 
Trans-Siberian Main Line that connects Siberia with the central 
regions of Russia runs through this territory, and in 
implementing to the full extent Decree No. 205-II by the head of 
the Omsk Oblast Administration, dated 1 June 1993. In 
particular, the decree refers to the need to create zones of 
free crossborder trade in the rayons of Omsk Oblast adjacent to 
the Republic of Kazakhstan and the establishment of free 
enterprise zones in Omsk Oblast.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy: "There Are Two Inflations in </F>
Russia: the Official One and the Real One; The Increase in 
Nonpayments Will Either Destroy the Myth of a Drop in Inflation 
or Will Put an End to Russian Industry"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  On the Eve? </H5>
  Official inflation indices continue to amaze the observer 
with their order and downward trend. It will be recalled that in 
February inflation did not exceed, according to these data, 10 
percent, and in March--9 percent. Sergey Dubinin, acting 
minister of finance, expects a further drop in the rate of 
inflation. Viktor Gerashchenko came out with a statement that 
the Central Bank will possibly lower the rate of refinancing to 
100-110 percent in the second half of the year, that is, by a 
factor of two. On Friday a memorandum of the government and the 
Central Bank on economic policy was signed. It supports 
benchmarks of 7 percent monthly inflation by the end of the year 
set by the prime minister. And the IMF, in the person of the 
administrative director, treated the policy of the Russian prime 
minister kindly, promising to express his approval of the policy 
being conducted at a meeting of the board of directors: The 
government has maintained its monetarist priorities in the fight 
against inflation. 
  Meanwhile, the grounds for choosing this policy, and indeed 
Russian inflation itself, deserve a lot of attention. What, 
nonetheless, is the real rate of inflation in Russia? Most 
likely, no less than 15 percent (taking into account the 
so-called "debt" prices). 
  Inflation is calculated by the government center for 
economic 
conditions by sectors. The increase in consumer prices in the 
market is really less than 10 percent per month. But the 
increase in prices for services to the population in March 
totaled about 15 percent, and the increase in energy 
prices--13.9 percent; moreover, this indicator even seems 
surprisingly low for energy sources--by comparison with the 
previous month of this year. 
  Thus, as before in the fight against inflation, production 
and the agro-industrial complex, which deal in the sluggish 
consumer market, are the most suppressed--they are affected by 
demand restrictions and the competition of imports. "The 
obviously increased" producer prices that, on the one hand, are 
being squeezed by an almost stable ruble and imports and, on the 
other hand, energy sources, judging by everything, are not used 
in calculating inflation, inasmuch as formal calculations on 
them are not conducted, but only "mutual indebtedness emerges." 
  Proving to be extremes, industry and landowners do not 
perform the role of extras (the agro-industrial complex, 
together with the coal miners, draw on the budget generously); 
however, with industry the government prefers to resolve 
problems individually. What is left of plants everywhere and the 
increase in hidden unemployment are reflected in the White House 
only by meetings on problems of the giants like ZIL [Likhachev 
Automobile Plant]. 
  Demand restrictions, whether being conducted by virtue of 
the 
inertia of the government machine or because of a sincere 
conviction of their necessity (it was Fedorov who shamed the Red 
directors), have led to the formation of hidden inflation; that 
is, an overhang of a mass of accounts between enterprises 
(nonpayments) not reinforced by money. A situation reminiscent 
of the summer of 1992 is being created when, after the Gaydar 
"squeeze," the sum of nonpayments amounted to 2.5 rubles [R] for 
each ruble enterprises had. Today this figure is 30-40 kopeks 
less; that is, the ratio is more than 1:2! "Unaccounted money" 
not only continuously makes a mess of the budget for tax 
revenues (in the first quarter less was collected than predicted 
by a factor of three), but it also generally removes the feeling 
of the severity of economic policy. For those who have not 
forgotten the inflationary "splash" (i.e., the emergence of 
tendencies that were not taken into account and that were not 
counted as inflation before mutual offsets) in the fall of 1992, 
the government's dreams of vouchers and other attempts to give 
the appearance that money can be done without in payments are 
quite indicative. And if Sergey Dubinin does not succeed in 
making this monetary overhang zero without eliminating industry 
as a class (after which, naturally, their debts to one another 
will disappear, and "debt prices" and inflation will be 
calculated by the movement of prices on the consumer market, 
where imports that are influenced only by import duties and the 
ruble rate of exchange dominate), given the assistance of an 
immediate all-Russian distribution of vouchers and the 
development of commercial credit, then even Viktor Gerashchenko 
will go down in the history of the Russian state as the grave 
digger of native producers, despite all his earlier services in 
their defense. Because if there is no method of resolving the 
problem of nonpayments without increasing the monetary mass, 
then it will not be resolved, because the method of resolution 
contradicts the policy of the government, and this means digging 
a hole for the economy. (But the government with the Central 
Bank has already sworn in a memorandum not to produce mutual 
offsets; under pressure from Yeltsin, import duties are about to 
be revised.) 
  An overall illusion, engendered by official figures, not 
only 
replaces reality in the estimate of inflation itself but also 
becomes a picture placed for us in the window depicting an 
idyllic scene in the economy everywhere. 
  We can vouch even less now that the dollar exchange rate 
established by the Central Bank reflects reality. After the 
introduction in Moscow of the new tax collection at the MMVB 
[Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange], the volume of trades there 
fell by a factor of three to four, and the main transactions are 
conducted now on the interbank market. Talks about economic 
integration in the CIS remain just that--there are no concrete 
results even with Belarus. "Experts" propose to conduct agrarian 
reform until the sowing campaign and to establish a system other 
than the American federal reserve system (only in the United 
States is there such a variant of the Central Bank). 
Privatization is being conducted according to the old scheme, 
although with greater deviations than previously--both in Moscow 
and in the regions. No mention has been made of an industrial 
and complex social policy, it also does not exist in the budget, 
bankruptcies are expected like common manna, and Oleg Soskovets 
is already being shot down by "little tin soldiers." 
  A paradoxical situation is developing: The forces that, it 
is 
generally admitted, previously used slogans of liberalism as a 
cover but then did something else are now being covered by this 
"something else," and they are creating liberalism exactly at a 
time when the voters and the producers are fighting against it, 
but the so-called reformers (from among the radicals) have ended 
up in a parliamentary minority. 
  There are paradoxes and paradoxes, but the creation of the 
illusion of the success of reforms can be interpreted in two 
ways. Either Chernomyrdin with Gerashchenko decided to pretend 
to be Gaydar and Fedorov--or the illustration of the success of 
economic transformations is needed for political use, whether it 
is for speeding up the signing of a memorandum on accord and/or 
the acceleration of integrational processes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Garyevich Nuzhnikov, deputy </F>
chairman of the Federal Service on Currency and Export Control, 
by Igor Ostrovskiy; place and date not given: "Currency Is 
Accumulating Beyond the Cordon; a Federal Service Was 
Established in Russia To Prevent the Plundering of the Country"] 
  [Text] Western experts think that Russia is 
shortchanged $12-$13 billion annually for commodities sold 
abroad. Therefore, specialists of the IMF and the International 
Bank do not always believe our leaders who give assurances that 
Russia is not in a position to either pay debts or do without 
outside assistance in the structural restructuring of industry. 
How is the money flowing abroad to be returned? The answer to 
this question is supposed to be given by the Federal Service on 
Currency and Export Control. Aleksandr Garyevich Nuzhnikov, the 
first deputy director of the service, talks about this. 
  "It must distress you as well, and many others. It will 
hardly be possible to return the dollars that have already 
accumulated in foreign banks to improve our economy. There are 
no domestic mechanisms or international agreements for this. We 
will have to build a normative-legal basis that henceforth will 
not allow even one Russian kopek to accumulate anywhere whatever 
except in the state treasury." 
  [Ostrovskiy] Aleksandr Garyevich, this means once again 
rules, instructions, methods... But specialists assure: Even 
without this, we are swamped by controlling and regulating 
documents! 
  [Nuzhnikov] I agree. The amount of paper is growing like a 
snowball. But the state of affairs, unfortunately, is almost 
unchanging. Many instructions, especially departmental ones, 
duplicate each other. At the same time, they do not provide 
answers to other questions. Do you know who works today on 
control in the currency-export sphere? The Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of 
Economics, the Main Customs Administration, and the Central 
Bank. But too many cooks spoil the broth. Inspections show that 
there are many holes in the legislation through which money 
flows past the treasury. 
  [Ostrovskiy] For example? 
  [Nuzhnikov] The splitting up and transfer of quotas. Even 
though this is forbidden, quotas for the export of strategically 
important raw materials are endlessly transferred from 
intermediary to intermediary until the possibility of monitoring 
the transaction vanishes. And accounts get blurred because of 
the great number of banks. There is no reliable control over the 
returnability of the currency to the country. 
  [Ostrovskiy] Can you propose another procedure? 
  [Nuzhnikov] There already are outlines for new rules. The 
right to export strategically important commodities will be 
granted only to major exporters. Strong, qualified, authorized 
banks will handle these operations. On government instructions 
we will verify the fulfillment of quotas allocated last year for 
the export of oil and the export operations of the Magnitogorsk, 
Cherepovets, West Siberia, and Norilsk metallurgical combines. 
We will examine conditions of contracts, their fulfillment, and 
the return of the share of currency belonging to the state. When 
we finish the work, a lot will be clarified, and we will be able 
to make the new documents more accurate and reliable. 
  [Ostrovskiy] There are a lot of commercial structures in the 
country that are engaged in currency operations without the 
right to them. Will they also fall within your field of vision? 
  [Nuzhnikov] What is first and foremost for us here is not so 
much punishment of the guilty as creation of a legal base. You, 
for example, know about the discussions concerning the firm GMM, 
which accepts hard currency and rubles at interest from physical 
and juridical persons without having a bank license. A lot can 
be done today, there is no legal base. However, it is not only 
this firm, but any commercial bank can cash any amount of hard 
currency and give permission for its export. 
  [Ostrovskiy] But are you not afraid of being accused of 
restoring a state monopoly in currency-export operations and 
thereby of hampering market reforms in Russia? 
  [Nuzhnikov] State control is compatible with the market. In 
France, currency control is a function of the customs service as 
a subdivision of their finance ministry. England had strict 
control over currency-export operations until it created an 
orderly system of laws that protected the interests of the 
state. I think that we will take specifically the English 
experience as a basis. 
  [Ostrovskiy] Will there be a long wait for the new 
legislation? 
  [Nuzhnikov] In the near future, we will submit to committees 
of the State Duma drafts of supplements and amendments to laws: 
"On Currency Regulation, Banks and Banking Activity," and to the 
Criminal Code and the Civil Code. After all, there is nothing in 
today's legislation except for the notorious Article 80, 
according to which anyone can be made answerable. Or there is 
also this kind of a passage: Violations and those guilty have 
been found. Who will recover that which belongs to the state? 
Who is confiscating property and selling it? In our opinion, 
such powers should be assigned to tax police. 
  [Ostrovskiy] In a word, the immediate task is to perfect the 
legislation. Where will you get the people for such work? 
  [Nuzhnikov] There are no specialists with this kind of 
profile in the country. We are learning and learning. Primarily 
specialists of the former Gosplan [State Planning Commission] 
and other state services come to us. Former state employees who 
have experience in work in commercial structures are especially 
valuable. 
  Russia undoubtedly needs a federal service that is 
capable of weaving a dense net from the laws and rules in order 
not to let even one kopek into foreign borders. But there is 
something in the plans of the managers of this service that 
compels one to ponder. First of all, the desire to subordinate 
all and everything that concerns currency and export to the 
state and its structures. Has the experience of Ukraine really 
not taught anything, where a similar practice could only 
aggravate the crisis in the economy and finances? Also not 
understandable are the hopes for future legal acts as a means of 
fighting violators. After all, even today's legislation makes it 
possible to make criminally answerable firms that work with 
finances and currency without a license of the Central Bank. God 
forbid that the new structure sees its purpose only in petty 
control and guardianship over exporters, banks, and 
businessmen.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Petrovich Rasskazov, deputy chairman of </F>
the Board of the All-Russian Exchange Bank, under the rubric 
"Viewpoint": "The Central Bank of Russia Should Establish the 
Rules of the Game"] 
  [Text] The theory and practice of world economics 
confirm that when changing a political and economic system in 
any state, the first stage of reforming the entire economy 
should be a reform of the banking system. As soon as the banking 
system in Russia really adapts to the market economy and assumes 
civilized features, the economic reforms will be set in motion. 
This is the opinion of the author of the article published 
below, who in the recent past was deputy chairman of the Central 
Bank of Russia and is now deputy chairman of the All-Russian 
Exchange Bank, Vladimir Petrovich Rasskazov. 
  How should the banking system be in our country? Recently 
the 
newspaper BIZNES I BANKI ran a well-researched article which 
contains an answer to this question (A.V. Molchanov and A.M. 
Tavasiyev, "The Banking System of Russia: What Should It Be?", 
BIZNES I BANKI No. 2, 1994). The article's authors sketch out 
the basic features of the banking system toward whose creation 
we should strive, perceiving it as having two levels with a 
certain amount of specialization of sublevels. They also 
indicate the requirements for individual parts of this system. 
While fully supporting the concept presented there, I would like 
to touch upon several important aspects of our banking future. 
  In order for the banking system, like the state of which it 
is a part, to be monolithic, it must have a foundation that can 
bring all of its parts together into a unified whole. Such a 
foundation--the financial-monetary system--of course, is 
unified, with a unified currency, and unified rules of the game 
pertaining to money. And these rules can only be established by 
the Central Bank--the sole regulator of the system. 
  If everything is more or less comprehensible regarding 
commercial banks as parts of a unified system, in my view there 
are many problems with the Central Bank. Let us begin with the 
fact that the Central Bank has 85 of its own administrative 
entities in various areas and regions of the country. And this 
means that the Central Bank is practically uncontrollable. 
Therefore significant changes are needed here. Why not do this, 
for example: Have the main branch of the Central Bank in Moscow 
and a maximum of 9-12 regional branches, each of which, in turn, 
would have direct jurisdiction over 8-12 subregional 
branches--according to the principle of the Sovnarkhozes 
[Soviets of People's Commissars] of Khrushchev's time. 
Incidentally, the Federal Reserve System of the United States 
was built according to this principle. As for the apparatus of 
the Central Bank, it can be cut by at least half--because its 
structures are poorly controlled as well. They are bloated with 
auxiliary personnel, they have a tendency toward further growth, 
and there is a duplication of control and management functions. 
  Today our Central Bank has not yet ceased to be remind one 
of 
a former branch of the USSR Gosbank [State Bank]. We must 
prohibit it from directly extending credit to financed entities. 
Yet to this day the Central Bank has an investment 
administration. It should not have such subdivisions--after all, 
the Central Bank should engage in refinancing commercial banks. 
If the state decides to build something or implement some large 
program, the Central Bank should issue special-purpose credit to 
the state or transfer these funds to commercial banks, and they 
will do the direct investing. But since the Central Bank issues 
credit, it should have a powerful organ controlling the activity 
of commercial banks. And here is where conflicts arise between 
the Central Bank and the commercial banks. The latter do not 
like it when somebody carefully oversees them. Recently, for 
example, the leaders of one well-known bank stated that they 
would not allow anybody from the outside into their bank, 
including representatives of the Central Bank. This, of course, 
is wrong because our Central Bank, like central emission banks 
throughout the world, has every right and obligation to oversee 
the commercial banks with respect to any aspects of their 
activity. How else could it be? When the Central Bank grants 
permission for the opening of a commercial bank, how can it tell 
its future clients that, having decided to open this bank, it 
takes responsibility for it and therefore they can invest money 
in it without worrying. And if the Central Bank acts as the 
guarantor of the commercial bank, it must know everything about 
it. Protection of confidential information received by the 
Central Bank from the commercial bank is another matter--here 
the parties must reach some kind of agreement between 
themselves. In any case, this can be regulated today. 
  With all the achievements in the regulation of relations 
among the parties, dissension among them will not cease until 
there is a law directly regulating these relations. I have in 
mind a so-called bank act which defines the problem of banking 
secrets and the nature and procedure whereby commercial banks 
convey information to the Central Bank. In other words, this 
document must determine the entire policy for overseeing the 
activity of commercial banks and all procedures for relations 
among the parties. In my view, it would not be out of place to 
create such a legislative document regulating relations between 
commercial banks and their clients as well. Only then will the 
Central Bank become a guarantor of the protection of the rights 
of clients, including the right reimbursement for damages caused 
to them. And the Central Bank, of course, must have special 
insurance funds and reserves in the event that the commercial 
banks go bankrupt. That is, these funds could guarantee the 
operation of the entire banking system. And no commercial bank 
could even think of encroaching on these funds. Moreover, the 
Central Bank, like the commercial banks, must bear 
responsibility if there are cases of "laundering" of money used 
in criminal activity. And all this should be backed by 
legislation. 
  As concerns the credit-monetary policy, I see the main tasks 
here as implementing it through the establishment of norms for 
reserves, liquidity, currency regulation, the discount rate for 
centralized credit (and it should be at least higher than the 
rates of inflation at any given moment) and others. As one of 
the authors of banking legislation, the Central Bank must 
establish these norms for commercial banks, and in order to 
control them effectively it must have feedback in the form of 
statistical information. Consequently, the country's main bank 
must constantly be gathering and generalizing statistics on the 
banks, which at the same time will serve as a basis for 
management of the national economy. Central Bank statistics are 
the most precise and accurate figures with valuation in rubles. 
Incidentally, the Central Bank should introduce centralized 
norms for banking statistics, since sooner or later Russian 
banking institutions will have to "merge" into the world banking 
system. Of course, this must be preceded by a transition to 
unified international bookkeeping standards. And it is still 
just being started, but even now we have a strange picture: Each 
commercial bank has its own plan for accounts, and sometimes 
they are extremely far removed from what is recommended by the 
Central Bank. It is hardly necessary to convince any specialist 
of the importance of introducing standardized international 
accounting and reporting documentation. And it is also necessary 
to standardize documents not only in form and content but also 
in size so that they will be "readable" by all machines--in 
Russia and abroad. I have had occasion to hear from leaders of 
certain commercial banks that they intend to introduce their own 
methodology for settling accounts. This cannot be allowed. The 
Central Bank must provide this methodology for the other banks. 
Otherwise this will be like creating some kind of separatist 
state with its own laws within the framework of our country. 
Therefore proponents of this kind of "banking separatism" are 
either incompetent people or people who are deliberately trying 
to make it easier to conduct certain illegal operations. 
  The interests of the matter demand also the development of a 
system of economic indicators which would be included in the 
primary accounting documentation and the settlement-payment 
documents, including checks and credit cards. These indicators 
should become the basis for statistical reporting as well. 
Without doing this the Central Bank cannot solve a single 
important problem, including the problem of nonpayments. This is 
the basic preparation of the so-called software. Unfortunately, 
as it were, this matter is not even off the ground yet. 
  The next important problem is the organization of 
settlements. I am convinced that there is no longer any 
alternative to cash settlement centers. But we must immediately 
start to optimize and standardize them. But sometimes things are 
reduced to the absurd. For example, in Leningrad Oblast, with a 
population of approximately 6 million, there are four to six 
cash settlement centers in operation that complete settlements 
in three days. But in Krasnodar Kray, with a comparable 
population, there are 38 cash settlement centers which cannot 
complete their work within acceptable periods of time. The 
picture is the same in Altay and also many other places. The 
quantitative distribution of cash settlement centers throughout 
the oblasts of the country has a striking lack of uniformity: 
from three to 54! And, after all, cash settlement centers, from 
the standpoint of common sense, should span rayons, with one 
center for every three to four rayons. They should have 
communications for delivering settlement documents taking into 
account the availability of storage facilities for cash 
reserves, transportation mainlines, and information networks. 
The Central Bank must not give anyone a system of settlements. 
In the event that alternative centers are created, copies of all 
postings must still be entered into the central computer of the 
Central Bank. What are alternative centers? I will explain with 
an example. Let us say that three or four banks create a 
clearing center on the basis of one of the commercial banks and 
process clearing documents for a group of commercial banks in 
one of them. A duplicate of all postings must then be sent to 
the Central Bank. Otherwise it will not be able to get an idea 
of the condition of monetary turnover, the situation with cash 
money, or how things are going with credit in the country. And 
as a result it would be impossible to establish an optimal 
discount rate or a realistic exchange rate for currencies. And a 
realistic exchange rate for currencies must be established with 
a special information system (analogous to the REUTER one) which 
would include all commercial banks working with currency and 
each day (and best of all in real time) would submit all 
information on currency operations to the Central Bank. The 
procedure followed now for establishing the exchange rate 
through the exchange creates preconditions for manipulating 
currency exchange rates in the interests of particular political 
and financial groups. 
  I must not fail to touch upon several more essential 
aspects. 
  Today many commercial banks (about 90 percent of them) are 
largely state banks. Their charter capital was formed, as a 
rule, from funds of state enterprises. I think it is time to 
solve the problem of privatization of these banks and return of 
state funds to the budget or to the state treasury--taking into 
account the inflation index during all the time of the 
withdrawal of state funds. We must not forget that the money 
lying in these banks as charter capital is our public money. 
Nothing terrible will happen here--after all, these banks have 
gotten fairly firmly on their feet. But here it is up to the 
Central Bank and parliament, which must adopt the corresponding 
legislative provisions. And the funds returned by the banks will 
be sources of investment in industry. 
  In order for our Central Bank to operate normally I think it 
has to have in its structure a powerful analytical subdivision 
which would analyze the national economy and the economy of the 
commercial banks. Moreover, it would be expedient to create 
under the Central Bank a public supervisory council with the 
right to make recommendations--consisting of representatives of 
science, industry, and commercial banks. The task of the council 
would be to conduct expert appraisals of important decisions of 
the Central Bank as is done abroad. I am categorically against 
the idea put forth by certain commercial banks of turning the 
Central Bank into a joint-stock company. In the present 
transition stage with our unruly market environment the Central 
Bank must remain a state institution. The Savings Bank of 
Russia, with more than 50 percent of its shares belonging to the 
Central Bank, is another matter. It is a monopolist subject to 
immediate privatization with the formation of regional, 
municipal, or territorial banks based on it. But today it seems 
to be advantageous both to state bureaucrats and to the Central 
Bank to have this kind of pump for extracting money from all of 
Russia, and they certainly do not spend all of it on the 
regions. And in the regions, because of the shortage of monetary 
resources, separatist sentiments are arising. 
  We absolutely must define and create a system of strict 
currency regulation. So far we have passed up important elements 
of this system--access of foreign banks for operation on Russian 
territory. And we should have done this for two reasons. First, 
hard currency would not then leak out of the country. What is 
the point in transferring it, say, to France if this money could 
be put in the Russian branch of the same French bank. The result 
would be the same, but it would be achieved at less cost. 
Second, foreigners would create healthy competition on our 
domestic market for banking services and would demonstrate the 
art of working, which would be to the advantage of domestic 
banking. But this step must be accompanied by a certain 
protectionism of these banks on the part of the Central Bank. 
Allowing foreign banks on our territory should be restricted and 
the privilege should be granted to only certain banks with good 
reputations that are significant and have a developed world 
infrastructure. Moreover, these banks could help their Russian 
colleagues to train bank specialists. 
  We will not change much unless we adhere in practice to the 
well-known administrative postulate: A new business must be 
created by new people; reforms cannot be conducted through the 
hands of those who are interested in retaining old procedures. 
It is necessary, for example, to promptly renew the 
administrative apparatus of the Central Bank, bringing in young 
talented and highly educated specialists. Chiefs of oblast 
special bank branches who have been working in this system for 
15-20 years, as a rule, are fairly conservative people. Their 
mentalities were formed at a different time and they will never 
become market players in the best sense of the word. The 
Americans say that if you are 35 years old and you do not have 
experience working with a computer, you will not acquire it 
because you are simply afraid of the computer. Thus for these 
people the "fear effect" will not allow them to master new 
banking technologies. 
  Now about work with cash money. The Central Bank should make 
some changes in this area as well. In my view, the Central Bank 
must return to the "Russia" checks. But they should be 
introduced gradually, being used at first in settlements with 
the population for durable goods only within the autonomous 
formations: The city or at most the oblast, when the main 
administration (city or oblast) is capable of developing a 
mechanism for the introduction of the checks and monitoring 
their migration. As for credit cards, for now they are 
acceptable in Russia only for businessmen and people who are 
simply rich. These cards will not soon become widespread in 
Russia. In order for credit cards to be in mass use it is 
necessary to have many things. For example, they must be 
produced in large quantities; it is necessary to have fairly 
costly devices--automatic teller machines; in stores, kiosks, 
cafes, train stations, airports, etc. there must be special 
devices for reading the information from the credit cards. All 
this will take a minimum of eight to 10 years. And the Russian 
mentality is not ready for them. That is, there are no 
alternatives to checks in Russia so far. 
  Incidentally, in the area of the introduction of an 
electronic payment system, like electronics in general, the 
Central Bank must show patriotism. It should not provide money 
to support foreign firms by buying their technical equipment, 
but this money should be used to convert domestic enterprises so 
that they will master the output of mass banking equipment. And 
not only computation equipment but also automatic teller 
machines, devices for reading credit cards, and the main 
thing--sorting machines for processing checks. 
  We will have to switch to international standards in 
electronics. And if representatives of the European Community 
gather in Geneva to develop a technical policy and particularly 
to decide which banking equipment to buy, we are resolving this 
problem with extraordinary ease: Each bank buys whatever it 
sees. Whatever country its representatives have managed to get 
to, there they make their purchases. But this is fatal for 
Russia. We need standards for technical policy. Otherwise we 
will get ourselves tightly involved in an electronic system of 
settlements without really understanding it. 
  And the last thing. Today we are discussing the problem of 
reducing the budget deficit by having the Ministry of Finance 
sell precious metals to the Central Bank. I think that in this 
case the Central Bank would only increase the liquidity of its 
capital by issuing empty money or, rather, at the expense of its 
long-suffering taxpayers. In my view this is a political 
solution that will harm the country's economy.

<F P=106> [Text of speech by D. Vasilyev, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation State Property Committee, given at the All-Russian 
Conference "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and 
Development of the Stock Market" held in Izhevsk in late March: 
"Completion of Check Privatization: Problems of the Present and 
Future"] 
  [Text] Check privatization is coming to a close. What 
are the results of it? To what degree was the path of market 
transformations chosen the correct one? What did the citizens of 
Russia receive? What will happen with the check investment 
funds? The participants in the All-Russian Conference "Problems 
of Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the 
Stock Market" held in Izhevsk in late March sought the answers 
to these questions. 
  Today we are presenting an account of the speech made 
at this conference by the chairman of the Russian Federation 
State Property Committee [GKI], D. Vasilyev. 
  Privatization has taken place. By 1994 most Russians had 
become stockholders. Last year 39,000 enterprises were 
privatized, in all 86,000 enterprises since the start of 
privatization. Thirty-one percent of the enterprises were 
privatized through the creation of joint stock companies, and 69 
percent--through their sale. As a result, large and medium-sized 
enterprises became truly private and the state's share in them 
is now less than 25 percent. Half of the people employed in 
Russian industry work in these enterprises and half of the 
country's industrial potential is concentrated there. 
  So, half of Russia is already bourgeois, although the other 
half remains socialist. Our job in the remaining 3 months is to 
privatize 70 percent of all enterprises, turn Russia into a 
more-or-less bourgeois country, and create the foundation for 
continued progress toward private ownership and market trade. 
  At the present time, privatization encompasses all sectors 
of 
the national economy, including, despite the long-time 
opposition, the fuel and power engineering complex. The 
military-industrial complex has also embarked on privatization, 
and the proportion of enterprises banned from privatization 
there is only about 30 percent; the rest will be privatized, and 
most of those will undergo check auctions. 
  Despite the difficulties, more than 85 million checks have 
been collected. This is of course not enough to say that all the 
problems have been resolved. As we certainly assumed, the 
situation in terms of regions is very differentiated. Even now, 
against the general background there are 10-15 outstanding 
"peredovik" [leader] regions (that is the old term, but there is 
no other as yet) where the number of people employed in private 
enterprises is on the order of 69 percent. They include St. 
Petersburg, Samara, Sverdlovsk and Vladimir oblasts, 
Arkhangelsk, and others. In those places the question being 
resolved is not so much privatization as it is attracting 
investments. The enterprises are preparing for a second issue, 
developing business plans, and deciding questions of raising 
economic efficiency. 
  But the situation is more complicated in some regions. And 
accordingly certain social, economic, and political problems may 
arise there. These are regions where the number of checks 
collected is substantially lower. About 20 regions are included 
among those where less than 20 percent of the checks have been 
collected. The GKI's task is to provide them with all kinds of 
help. This is necessary since the population takes a fairly 
serious attitude toward the checks. 
  But just what problems related to this will arise in the 
near 
future? What is the situation regarding use of the population's 
checks? 
  Unfortunately, a large part of the population (this is an 
objective reality) have not used their privatization checks and 
are confused over how to do it. In accordance with Russian 
peculiarities, a large part of the population will go to give up 
their checks at the last minute. That is to say, if we do not 
take advantage of April and May to actively influence the 
behavior of people as investors, June will be a tense period for 
some territories. That means those regions where there are many 
checks and a sufficient number of privatized enterprises have 
not been readied. If we do not rectify the situation, 
disappointment awaits people. They will have the right to ask 
the question, why their vouchers were not supported with the 
necessary objects of investment. 
  But what must be done to avert the looming conflict? 
  The first direction is to speed up check auctions. In 
accordance with the instructions of Mr. Chubays, more than 160 
of the largest enterprises in Russia are being put up for 
auction in May-June. Among them are more than six oil industry 
installations, Gazprom [Gas Industry], "Norilsknikel" [Norilsk 
Nickel], the largest nickel-producing monopoly enterprise, and 
most steamships. It is remarkable that for the first time 
military-industrial complex installations are being included in 
our schedule. They will be sold at interregional check auctions. 
  Apart from GKI activity, it is important to assess the 
results of the work at the local level. How are the 
opportunities being utilized for those enterprises which are 
being sold throughout the country's territory (for example, the 
Russian Joint Stock Company YeES [Unified Power System] of 
Russia)? Very poorly. That is precisely how we can describe the 
situation where a region participates in an all-Russian check 
auction and collects 100-200, a maximum of 1,000 checks, and the 
enterprises put up for auction are enormous. Usually four 
regions collect 75 percent of the checks (Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and Omsk). The rest of the regions do 
a poor job of taking advantage of these opportunities. The 
reasons are on the surface, as always. Information-explanatory 
work is being handled extremely badly, and there is not enough 
of it--people do not know the elementary things. But they must 
know them; namely, what is being sold, at what times, and where 
the application can be made. 
  A great deal depends on the local organs of power. We are 
going to survey the regions and find out how their 
organizational potential is being utilized. We can no longer 
talk about how there are no enterprises for sale now. Every week 
5-7 major enterprises are put up for auction and they are sold 
within a month. So on the order of 23-30 major enterprises will 
be sold at the same time. Accordingly, the effectiveness of the 
use of receiving points will be raised, and so on. 
  The second direction is regional check auctions. What is 
happening here? An ordinary person who makes rational judgments 
above all gives priority to local enterprises, since it is more 
convenient for him to participate in assembling stockholders, 
the location is more familiar, and the like. But, judging from 
the existence of plan schedules for regions (and there are now 
55 of them in the GKI), by-no-means all territories are ready 
for this work. 
  If the process of privatization is analyzed from the 
standpoint of selecting possible ways to create joint stock 
companies, clear preference is given to the second variant which 
allows the labor collective to obtain the controlling bloc of 
stock. Three-quarters of the enterprises which became joint 
stock companies chose this variant of privileges. One often 
hears that such an approach closes off opportunities to 
influence an enterprise and control it. I do not quite agree 
with that. For example, in St. Petersburg the danger of the 
second variant does not particularly disturb anyone, since a 
simple process occurs because the securities market is developed 
and privatized enterprises are fairly attractive. The altogether 
normal, healthy process of buying up stock from the enterprise's 
employees begins right during the closed subscription or after 
it is over. And two forces operate here; on the one hand, the 
director buys up the stock, and on the other, the outside 
investor, who usually acts through brokers. As a result, the 
proportion of the outside investor increases substantially if he 
puts effort into it. 
  The picture is different in regions with an undeveloped 
securities market, where the directors face the task of making 
themselves the "chairmen of the kolkhoz" at their own 
enterprises. The solution to this situation is to continue to 
accelerate development of the stock market and buy up stock from 
the labor collective members and the directors. How much time 
will be needed to do that? In St. Petersburg this process takes 
an average of only 9 months. And essentially there is no 
enterprise where such an opportunity would not exist. 
  Privatization in Russia has brought a new institution with 
it, check investment funds [ChIF]. We can now already say that 
ChIF's not only have come into existence, but they represent a 
real economic force. They have collected more than one-third of 
the vouchers and represent the interests of more than 30 million 
stockholders. Their activity does not contradict the fundamental 
interests of developing the Russian economy. When they interact 
with the management of privatized enterprises, ChIF's make such 
demands as investing in production and following a market 
strategy. The ChIF's are a new institution in the stock market 
which has the smallest interest in inflation; this distinguishes 
them from commercial banks. The latter pump preferential state 
credits through themselves and are completely indifferent to how 
they are used in the economy and whether they are returned or 
not. The ChIF's occupy an altogether different position. They 
have a real social base to resolve the question of financial 
stabilization. Such a base did not exist in 1992-1993 and 
accordingly the problem remained. The situation has changed now. 
And that inspires the hope that there will be a turn for the 
better in 1994-1995. 
  The GKI is trying to assist the ChIF's, and that includes 
using measures envisioned in the state privatization program. 
Basic attention has been devoted to tax questions, the 
possibility of having blocs of enterprises' stock, and 
determination of the ways to conduct stockholder meetings. Today 
the question of corporate management is becoming the focus of 
the agenda after making enterprises joint stock companies is 
complete. Very soon the Law "On Joint Stock Companies" is to be 
discussed. I think that in connection with this the government 
faces serious disputes, since the question will arise: how will 
enterprises be managed when the lack of control over directors 
reaches the maximum. 
  There is one more problem: who will participate in the 
capital of our enterprises? I have been, am, and will remain an 
opponent of commercial banks' participating in the capital of 
industrial enterprises. Only investment banks and investment 
institutions which will engage in long-term crediting but not 
cashier service to clients can have this right. Let them invest 
and participate in the capital of industrial enterprises. That 
is the fundamental issue. 
  These and other important questions must be resolved soon. 
"Voucher" privatization is coming to an end, and we must 
determine what has been accomplished, and how, and where we 
should go from here. Life itself will answer many questions. 
But for now the agenda includes developing a strategy for the 
next stage of market reforms.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Aleksandr Shokhin by Nikita </F>
Kirichenko, Aleksandr Privalov, and Andrey Shmarov at the 
KOMMERSANT publishing house; date not given; published under the 
rubric "Very Important": "Wait for Your Debt Far Away and for a 
Long Time"] 
  [Text] Last Wednesday, 23 March, Aleksandr Shokhin came to 
the KOMMERSANT publishing house. Thus a good tradition of 
informal communication between high-ranking statesmen and 
KOMMERSANT experts was continued. Boris Fedorov started this 
tradition last year. However, two months after visiting 
KOMMERSANT Boris Fedorov left the government, whereas Aleksandr 
Shokhin originated a new tradition--one day after his visit to 
KOMMERSANT he was given the post of deputy prime minister with a 
portfolio in the government. 
  However, we have always proceeded from the fact that status 
is not the only thing to grace a person, as long as he says 
interesting things. 
<H5>  Shokhin on Camdessus, the Duma, and the People </H5>
  Naturally, the foremost desire of KOMMERSANT experts meeting 
with a man with whose participation credit exceeding $2 billion 
had just been shaken loose was to find out how this is done and 
how the outcome of negotiations with the IMF can determine the 
domestic array and correlation of forces with regard to economic 
reform. 
  Regarding the intrigue itself involving negotiations about 
the second tranche of IMF systemic credit, Aleksandr Shokhin 
informed us that the Russian position on, or rather opposition 
to, G-7 was set forth in early December. A meeting was scheduled 
for 17 December at which it was planned to begin the development 
of a new plan for supporting Russian reform so as to begin a new 
cycle of financial stabilization scheduled literally day by day 
as early as 1 February. 
  However, according to Aleksandr Shokhin, the Duma elections 
and subsequent events caused the negotiating schedule to fall 
through. In the opinion of the minister, the first blow to the 
progress of negotiations was struck by the former advisers to 
the government, Mr. Sachs and Mr. Oslund, who "tried to create 
an atmosphere such as not to provide financial support for this 
government--it is patently conservative and antireformist. If 
Gaydar and Fedorov are not in it, it would be better to delay 
assistance until they return to the government again." 
  In the process, as our guest noted, "Yegor Timurovich and 
Boris Grigoryevich themselves support a line of this kind. Yegor 
Timurovich made a statement of this kind in Bonn; although he 
later denied this fact, the stenographic record says what it 
says." 
  Touching on the contents of the negotiations with the IMF, 
Aleksandr Shokhin observed with some pride that for the first 
time they proceeded according to the scenario of (what we seemed 
to hear was virtually "to the dictation of") the Russian side. 
  During a meeting with the prime minister, Michel Camdessus 
named certain parameters which the IMF considered acceptable as 
conditions for the extension of credit, in particular, a 7-8 
percent rate of inflation by the end of the year. The minister 
noted: "In the process they of course did not fail to say that 
Mr. Yeltsin was setting correct tasks (3-5 percent by the end of 
the year) and, they said, the government should not be avoiding 
implementation of the president's message. Nonetheless, IMF 
experts grasped our arguments; this already amounted to 
readiness to shift their old dogmatic positions in a more 
realistic direction." 
  Before finally making a determination as to how realistic 
the 
budget projections of the government for 1994 were, Michel 
Camdessus met at the Duma with Nikolay Rybkin and Sergey 
Glazyev, who fervently supported the government. Aleksandr 
Shokhin said: "This made a strong impression on Camdessus; it 
turned out that the Duma was monetarist, perhaps even more so 
than the government. Of course, it is hardly so, but he found no 
opposition to the government there nonetheless." 
  Aleksandr Mikolayevich also told us that Mr. Camdessus 
"visited a working man in the village--he wanted to see how the 
people were doing. He happened upon a working man whose entire 
hut was overflowing with books, and he spun tales for Camdessus 
for three hours. I do not rule out that this was also a factor 
in moderating the position of the IMF. It was good that he did 
not drop into a neighboring hut." It turns out that this is how 
a creditor needs to be boxed in tightly, from three directions 
(the government, the Duma, and the people), so that he will loan 
more. 
  Further on, we decided to cover in our conversation another 
aspect of the issue--debt repayment or, in other words, the 
manner in which the fact of signing the agreement with the IMF 
will influence negotiations concerning the foreign debt. The 
minister answered: At present the entire problem is that the 
agreement with the Paris Club, dated 2 April 1993, specifies 
that interest for the restructuring of the foreign debt in 1994 
shall be set at 100 percent, whereas in 1994 we paid 40 percent, 
or $2 billion less. 
  At the same time, a new round of negotiations just could not 
begin while Russia had no agreement with the IMF. As 
subsequently came out in our conversation, the club had, to put 
it mildly, certain grounds for this. Aleksandr Nikolayevich 
recalled how last year "we said: We have $2.5 billion in the 
budget for all of your business; we do not even know what the 
restructuring pattern will be; we do not know about your 
intricacies. Here is money for you, think yourselves about how 
to do it. They said: This is without precedent; it is not done 
this way, with payments being reduced to zero for entire items, 
including interest payments. This had never happened indeed. 
Nonetheless, at the time we pressed the point home with them." 
  At this point we somehow legitimately recalled apprehensions 
which are now being voiced concerning the fate of repayment of 
the domestic foreign exchange loan of the VEB [Bank for Foreign 
Economic Relations] (see KOMMERSANT, No. 9, pp. 6-10). On one 
hand, if we succeed in economizing on payments to the Paris 
Club, and if money from the monetary fund arrives quite promptly 
(according to Shokhin it may arrive as early as late April), 
chances for the regular (on-time) servicing of the domestic 
foreign exchange debt will improve. On the other hand--you will 
know yourselves (see above).... 
  As the saying goes, "debts follow debt," and thereafter the 
conversation smoothly moved on to the issue of ruble-denominated 
debt. 
<H5>  Shokhin on Nonpayments and the Domestic Debt </H5>
  The issue of nonpayments surfaced in the 
conversation every now and then. Thus, when Mr. Shokhin was 
discussing the proposal of the Ministry of the Economy to 
eliminate quotas and licensing for oil exports, he directly 
indicated what caused this proposal to be made: In the immediate 
future, the combination of quota-setting and the nonpayments 
crisis may bring about a stoppage in the oil industry because 
the latter has no opportunity to compensate for the insolvency 
of Russian customers by increasing exports. 
  It subsequently came out that, in the words of the minister, 
the current "semi-market" mechanism for carrying out 
intergovernmental agreements with CIS countries is breaking down 
because of the nonpayments crisis and the insolvency of Russian 
enterprises. For example, Roskontrakt purchases oil in Russia, 
pushes it through to Uzbekistan, sells it, buys cotton, and 
brings the latter here--and it turns out that nobody is in a 
position to buy cotton at these prices. "It is easier for 
precisely the Uzbeks and Kazakhs to meet such obligations. 
Everything is centralized there. This is why we should either 
change the arrangement, too, and use the arrangement for the 
administrative regulation of deliveries under such agreements, 
or altogether abandon them." 
  The same topic resurfaced in the discussion on the need to 
augment budget revenues. Aleksandr Shokhin said that it is not 
simple to raise taxes and not only because "in some instances 
the physical limit for these taxes is being reached. There are 
other motives, too. For example, the excise tax on gas may be 
increased, but will this generate real revenues for the budget? 
Nobody knows whether the excise tax will become merely a 
calculated value because of nonpayments." 
  At the same time, Mr. Shokhin clearly led us to understand 
that the government does not at all intend to undo the 
nonpayments crisis by the "traditional method." What is the 
situation with "nontraditional methods?" The deputy prime 
minister noted with satisfaction that "the mentality" of the 
captains of industry "has finally begun to change--they have 
already stopped seeking credit from the government and have 
rushed to commercial structures, and are indeed prepared to 
accept any terms in order to ensure the infusion of money into 
production." He himself added: "However, this is just beginning; 
we are not managing to make it through...." Since we are not 
making it, plants will be idled. 
  This position of the minister of the economy makes a 
particularly strong impression against the background of data 
from his own ministry (see KOMMERSANT, No. 10, p. 11): The 
Ministry of the Economy calculates that each ruble of public 
debt generates 2-3 rubles [R] in the debt of enterprises. 
  However, we hate like hell to pay back the debt. If, as we 
remember, Mr. Shokhin has managed to restructure the foreign 
debt brilliantly, if he has convinced hard-boiled Western 
creditors that a country with a trade budget surplus of 
approximately $20 billion is just not in a position to pay more 
than $2.5 billion on its obligations--will he really be 
intimidated by restructuring the domestic debt? Do Russian 
agrarians or defense sector people surpass the Paris and London 
Clubs in terms of negotiating steadfastness? Even if they do, it 
means that they are inferior to the Paris and London Clubs on 
some other score.... 
<H5>  Shokhin On Attracting Nonstate Investment </H5>
  Aleksandr Shokhin answered our question about how the 
minister views restructuring and a pick-up in investment 
activities as straightforwardly as a Roman--there is no money in 
the budget, and for this reason, he views centralized investment 
as merely a continuous patching up of economic holes. The 
minister explained: Social projects (for example, housing) and 
conversion will account for the lion's share of investment 
outlays. As far as capital investment in effective production 
projects is concerned, according to the budget about R4 trillion 
will be allocated for it, which is mere scraps. 
  Besides, the minister confirmed in principle the supposition 
of KOMMERSANT experts that the government also lacks a reliable 
mechanism for the placement of state investment; moreover, the 
investment arrangement proposed once again by the Ministry of 
the Economy is patently unworkable. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin reasons absolutely soberly that a draft of 
the compilation of the state investment program which, in 
particular, calls for investment through state agents (the 
Gosinkor [expansion not identified] and the Russian Finance 
Corporation) does not ensure the main point--guarantees of the 
recovery of investment. "So, we will give money to Nechayev 
(president of the Russian Finance Corporation--note by 
KOMMERSANT), but he will not pay it back. Well, it did not work 
out. And what is the Russian Finance Corporation going to be 
liable with? Its building on Georgiyevskiy Lane?" 
  It makes sense, and yet the minister has something up his 
sleeve. Aleksandr Shokhin stated that a draft decree on a 
contract between a government commission and a certain 
consortium of commercial banks is already on the prime 
minister's desk. As we understood from a not too extensive 
commentary by the minister, the idea of this contract is as 
follows. 
  Shokhin believes that demand constraints have finally 
started 
working at this particular time--there are no sales, enterprises 
are screeching to a halt, but directors, on the contrary, have 
begun to hustle. If so, state investment for them, the 
directors, is no longer pennies from heaven but rather a rare 
genuine opportunity to survive. Therefore, it is logical to 
surmise that this investment should be fought for. 
  And just how? By "matching" one's own or private funds with 
those of the state. The minister gave an example: The Tekhnokhim 
Association from St. Petersburg insisted on having its project 
financed from the budget; representatives of the enterprise 
showed up at the ministry on this business regularly. Ultimately 
a condition was set for them: Bring in a reputable foreign 
investor, and you will get money. An investor came along fast: 
In turn, he was promised that state funds would be invested in 
the project, and some foreign investors in certain places still 
believe on occasion that if the state is forking it over, 
recovery will be no problem. 
  It is for this arrangement that the project with the 
participation of the bank consortium has apparently been 
developed; Shokhin thinks that each R1 in state funds must 
attract R4 in private capital. 
  Of course, it is a good idea, if for no other reason than 
because it envisions some kind of partnership between the state 
and business. However, we are afraid that we will not go very 
far even with this idea. 
  The reason is very simple. If total capital investment in 
the 
national economy is calculated with the fourfold investment 
multiplier--in keeping with Shokhin's arrangement--taken into 
account, it turns out that investment will "give off" 10 percent 
this year (an estimate of the Ministry of the Economy itself). 
It is clear that no investment policy can be made with such 
scant capital, and that the 12 percent projected drop ("active 
stabilization" scenario) which was "approved" by the government 
last Thursday (after the minister's visit to KOMMERSANT) will 
have to be discarded. Moreover, in this case there is perhaps no 
dodging a 20 percent drop, as presented in a different scenario 
of the projection. 
  However, the saddest point which our conversation with the 
minister suggests: Shokhin is terribly averse to "working" the 
investment multiplier a little. Meanwhile, there are 
possibilities there: It is lucrative indeed to emit a ruble, 
place it with the mysterious consortium for an effective 
project, and tie up R4 in private capital. Of course, it is 
clear that the multiplier will decrease as emission proceeds: 
Private money is short, whereas emission will bring about the 
growth of the budget deficit. However, money will not be spent 
in vain, either. 
  But the minister just will not budge. He talked with regret 
about the need to pay back the domestic debt, and with virtual 
horror about the growth of the budget deficit. Nonetheless, 
KOMMERSANT experts got the impression that ("I know that you 
know that I know") everything has not yet been lost, and that an 
affair between the minister and the economy is still possible. 
  Of course, special piety has to be shown for the budget 
while 
Camdessus is around. After a period of time it will be possible 
to recall that "the tiger is made of paper": After all, the 
level of intake of taxes by the state budget dropped by a factor 
of two in the initial months of the year--from 18 percent of the 
gross domestic product last year to 9 percent this year. If the 
budget still cannot be implemented--with this kind of 
nonpayment--it may be treated more liberally. After all, a 
softer budget cannot be smuggled past the Duma and the IMF 
anyway, but life needs to go on....

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kalmykov, minister of justice of the </F>
Russian Federation, by Miroslav Buzhkevich, DELOVOY MIR 
political observer; place and date not given: "Laws for the 
Market"] 
  [Text] Russian businesspeople justifiably complain 
about the weak, fragmented legal base for entrepreneurship. It 
has become an impediment to the development of market relations 
and stands in the way of expanding all areas of business. What 
is being done to overcome the legal "inadequacy"--this is the 
subject of the discussion between Russian Federation Minister of 
Justice Yuriy Kalmykov and DELOVOY MIR political observer 
Miroslav Buzhkevich. 
  [Buzhkevich] The position of our entrepreneurs is 
unenviable. 
In addition to objective difficulties related to the decline of 
production and the disturbance of economic ties, at each step 
they encounter all kinds of legal restrictions that hamper their 
initiative. Is it true, Yuriy Khamzatovich, that the legal base 
for entrepreneurship in our country is that weak? 
  [Kalmykov] The first steps to its creation were taken a 
couple of years ago. The Union parliament adopted a most 
important Law on Property and also the Fundamentals of Civil 
Legislation. After these came analogous Russian legal acts: On 
Property, On the Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Activity, On 
Banks and Banking Activity, etc. So it would be wrong to say 
that we do not have a base for development of the market. It is 
another matter that this base is painfully inadequate and still 
weak. 
  Not only do we not have enough concrete legal acts, but we 
are lacking the main thing--an integrated system of 
interconnected and mutually conditioned laws based on common 
principles of market relations. We are wrong to hurry to create 
special normative acts, say, concerning the coal industry or 
grain without relying on specific initial positions. Throughout 
the rest of the world they have begun with basic codified acts 
such as the Civil Code, the Trade Turnover Code, etc. The 
practice of issuing particular government decrees is being 
reflected in the regulation of the entire market space. There 
are still frequent cases of the appearance of legal acts that 
contradict those that already exist. For example, a draft of 
Fundamentals of Land Legislation was prepared in which all the 
questions--conclusion of purchase and sale transactions, 
leasing, inheritance policy etc.--were resolved differently from 
the way they are in the Civil Code. And regulation should be 
standard for all objects of market circulation. If, for example, 
securities are inherited according to one set of rules and 
buildings and motor vehicles according to another, if each 
special law introduces its own norms--there will be no market. 
  [Buzhkevich] You mentioned the Civil Code. It is considered 
to be the main market law and is even called the business bible. 
Why? 
  [Kalmykov] I would call the Civil Code the constitution of 
market relations. It is head and shoulders above any special 
federal law and has great legal force. If particular provisions 
of the latter contradict it, preference is always given to the 
norms established by the Civil Code. 
  The first, so-called general, part of it contains 
descriptions pertaining to participants in market turnover. Both 
citizens and legal entities. And also the Russian state, 
components of the Federation, and municipal structures. They 
used to be participants not in civil relations but in 
subordinate, administrative ones. Additionally, this same part 
of the Code contains a practically complete description of all 
subjects of civil relations: economic partnerships, companies, 
associations, concerns, etc. Conditions are determined for their 
creation, organization, and liquidation. It also discusses what 
commercial organizations and institutions are. 
  The draft recognizes: Civil law applies to all 
commodity-monetary relations. Including everything related to 
the land and other kinds of immovable property. 
  At the same time the draft does not envision regulation of 
market relations. And it recognizes the need for direct 
indication in the law of cases where price regulation, mandatory 
conclusion of agreements, etc. are allowed. Such a system is 
typical of developed market relations. 
  It is extremely important that the new Civil Code be in 
effect in a society with a socially oriented market economy. And 
it envisions guarantees and means of protecting the interests of 
the weak party in legal relations, which most frequently is the 
citizen. 
  [Buzhkevich] I would like to hear the extent to which the 
new 
Code takes into account and protects the rights of 
entrepreneurs? This interests our readers. 
  [Kalmykov] The entire content of the Code, its letter and 
spirit, are aimed at providing for free development of civilized 
market relations. But before speaking about protecting the 
rights of businesspeople I would mention their responsibilities. 
When engaging in entrepreneurial activity they must act in good 
conscience, reasonably, fairly, observing the requirements of 
the law, moral principles of society, and the rules of business 
ethics. 
  The draft of the Code, naturally, contains many innovations 
which simply could not have existed previously. I would say the 
primary one is granting commercial organizations (with the 
exception of state and municipal enterprises) general legal 
capacity, which makes it possible for them to participate in all 
kinds of business without changing their charter documents. 
Further, companies and partnerships, including full 
partnerships, are becoming the main participants in the 
entrepreneurial practice. 
  All property owners are given guarantees of their rights to 
possession, use, and disposition of their property. At the same 
time an exhaustive list of cases in which forced confiscation of 
property from its owner, which is allowed only by a court 
decision, will be created. 
  Liability for violation of commitments related to business 
is 
also interpreted in a new way. Previously the entrepreneur or 
firm paid for failure to observe a contract or agreement only 
when this occurred because of their own fault. According to the 
draft Code, the only person relieved of liability is the one who 
can prove that his failure to meet his commitments was caused by 
an insurmountable force, that is, a natural disaster or 
something similar. 
  Freedom of contract has been established, whereby its 
conditions are determined by the parties themselves. In order 
for this principle not to lead to unlimited arbitrariness on the 
part of the entrepreneurs, especially those who hold a 
monopolistic position in the market, and also in the interests 
of the consumers, the concept "public contract" is introduced. 
It applies to commercial organizations engaging in retail trade, 
passenger traffic on public transportation, electricity supply 
for housing, and medical, hotel, municipal, and consumer 
services. They do not have the right to refuse these services to 
citizens or establish any advantages or privileges for anyone. 
  The second, special part of the Civil Code has to do with 
specific kinds of market turnover: contracts for delivery, 
purchase-sales, leasing, shipment, insurance, the procedure for 
capital construction, etc. Related to it are relations involving 
intellectual property (inventions, copyrights, etc.) and also 
problems of bequeathment and inheritance. 
  [Buzhkevich] When can we expect the completion of the work 
on 
the Civil Code and its ratification? 
  [Kalmykov] I think that the special part of the new Code 
will 
be ready by May or June. And the first, general part was 
completed long ago by scholars of the Research Center of Private 
Law and other scholarly institutions as well as specialists of 
our ministry. The government has approved this part and it would 
be possible to examine it, but the draft has not yet been turned 
over to the State Duma. 
  Here I would like to make a digression. The idea was that 
all 
draft laws related to economic problems were to be prepared in 
the government and, as legislative initiative, sent to the 
parliament. The whole problem is that the Cabinet of Ministers 
has no mechanism for this. The prepared draft laws drown in the 
waves of bureaucratic red tape. For example, the first deputy 
prime minister orders that the prepared draft of a legal act be 
turned over to parliament, but the bureaucrats begin to discuss 
whether or not it is expedient and timely to do this. Days and 
weeks pass, and during this time other structures turn in 
similar drafts of their own and thus cross the road to the 
government. 
  The same thing happens in the apparatus of the presidential 
administration. It is apparently no accident that B. Yeltsin 
recently said in a public statement that the bureaucratic 
apparatus is holding everything in its deadly embrace. 
  The fate of the draft of the general part of the Civil Code 
can serve as a clear example of this. As I have already said, 
the government has approved it and it was turned in to the 
State-Legal Administration (GPU) under the president. And they 
are able to hold documents for a good long time. More than two 
months have passed but the draft is still not being studied or 
evaluated. I cannot understand what motivates its leaders to 
create such red tape. Perhaps they never find the time to gain 
an understanding of the draft. Sometimes a "seditious" idea 
occurs: How can it be that such a serious action, which will 
have an extremely significant impact on the country's future, 
was prepared without their participation. But there is no 
special point in trying to find the causes of red tape. It is 
more important to get the draft of the Civil Code turned over 
for discussion in the State Duma. The GPU has long been 
competing with the Ministry of Justice (that began back under 
Minister N. Fedorov) and it cannot understand that this kind of 
"competition" only harms the cause. 
  [Buzhkevich] You said that the new Code or, rather, its 
general part could be approved by the middle of the summer. 
Where do you get your optimism? In the Duma there will probably 
be people who oppose the draft. 
  [Kalmykov] Yes, the debates will be heated. One of the 
stumbling blocks is the problem of buying and selling land. I 
think that certain factions of agrarians and communists are 
trying to block the point about complete freedom to conclude 
such agreements. 
  The Duma includes representatives of the so-called economic 
law, which existed in Soviet times as a part of jurisprudence 
which was actually against commodity-monetary relations. They 
have advised in favor of the dominance of administrative 
regulation of such relations. Today supporters of economic law 
have been forced to hedge their bets and are no longer opposing 
a transition to the market. But they think that the movement 
toward it should be different from what it is now. They assert 
that instead of a civil code it is more important to adopt a 
trade code. But we think that it is necessary to enact the Civil 
Code and see how it "works." It is quite possible that it will 
be able to encompass all problems of commercial credit as a 
whole. Then there will be no need for a trade code. But we 
cannot rule out the possibility of adopting a trade code after 
the civil code. 
  [Buzhkevich] But still one cannot consider the Civil Code to 
be the only and all-encompassing legal act, which removes all 
legal and organizational barriers from the path to 
entrepreneurship and market relations. Concrete, as you say, 
special laws are also needed. 
  [Kalmykov] And quite a few of them. To begin with I will 
mention the law on the joint-stock company. In principle its 
draft is ready. But the developer, the State Committee for 
Administration of State Property, having received our remarks, 
will not finish "digesting" it. 
  There is an extreme need for a law on the state enterprise. 
Regardless of how widely the market economy may spread, a 
certain and considerable part of the fixed capital of the 
national economy, including factories, plants, etc., will remain 
in state hands. And all of these must be controlled and their 
fate must be decided: Should they be reconstructed or closed 
down? And this can be done by using a special law. 
  There is an especially great need for an act on registration 
of legal entities, that is, companies, partnerships, concerns, 
etc. This area is now nothing but anarchy and confusion. 
Registration is handled, and far from professionally, by the 
mayor's offices and other municipal structures. And dishonest 
bureaucrats are blatantly getting rich at the expense of 
entrepreneurs and even certain private organizations. If you do 
not give bribes you risk not being registered until several 
months after you submit the document, or else you might be 
refused altogether. 
  The law on registration will put an end to this confusion 
and 
arbitrariness. It will introduce a standard policy for this 
operation for all legal entities. A Russian State Register of 
them will be created. All this will increase the protection of 
the interests of civilian participants and thus market relations 
as well, and it will open up to them the possibility of 
verifying the real state of affairs of their partners and it 
will also make it difficult to commit abuses when reorganizing 
or liquidating entrepreneurial structures. The Ministry of 
Justice will take charge of state registration of legal 
entities. Perhaps we will create a special service. 
  Finally, there is the problem of transportation relations. 
Today they are a Tabula rasa--a clean slate. All transportation 
regulations and codes have "long beards": They are antediluvian, 
the rules they set do not correspond to the present day or 
market relations. Look at what is being done on the railroads. 
Deadlines for delivering freight are not being met, freight is 
frequently lost, and sometimes it is stolen. There is nothing 
you can say about the position of the passengers either. None of 
the transportation workers--neither the railroads nor the 
airlines nor the motor vehicle services nor the river 
transportation services is responsible to them in any way at 
all. We have not come a step closer to international standards 
here. 
  All this is completely out of keeping with the rules of 
market turnover. The regulations for rail and automotive 
transportation and the aviation code must be created from 
scratch. And they must correspond fully to the Civil Code. And 
transportation workers and those who defend them in the state 
structures must understand that the stricter the demands for 
service to the clients, the more the railroad workers and 
airline personnel themselves stand to gain because life will 
force them to work honestly and in an organized way, and they 
will finally be rid of the constant insulting, although fair, 
criticism against them. 
  [Buzhkevich] You mentioned those who protect the interests 
of 
transportation workers in state structures. This kind of 
protection is frequently called lobbying. How do you feel about 
this phenomenon, which until quite recently was considered to be 
purely capitalistic and is now spreading to our country? 
  [Kalmykov] There is lobbying and then there is lobbying. In 
countries with developed market relations lobbying has long been 
an important institution of political and economic life. They 
have a multitude of forms which undertake to help joint-stock 
companies, commercial firms, and political parties to conduct 
their transactions, projects, and programs. In a number of 
countries experts of these firms are credited with the 
parliament, the government, and the presidential administration. 
It is not easy to obtain this accreditation. It is necessary to 
be not only a specialist with a degree in the area in which the 
firm is engaged but also to be well versed in public and private 
law. Any concealed lobbying is punishable by law or becomes an 
occasion for scandalous disclosures that cost the careers of 
political figures and commercial and financial bigwigs. 
  And I am for this kind of completely civilized lobbying. 
  But now, during the period of transition to the market, the 
proper conditions for this kind of activity do not exist. And 
what we now call lobbying has nothing in common with it and 
causes harm to society and the economy. Because it is based on 
corporate or personal connections and frequently on corruption 
and bribes. And most often it leads to the transfer of materials 
and funds to those regions and those branches of the national 
economy which you cannot call the most needy, the ones in a 
catastrophic situation. 
  When the state budget for this year was being formed I 
observed how the chairman of the government did everything he 
could to hold up under the pressure from involved individuals 
and groups who were trying to pull apart the cost side of the 
budget in the name of branch, corporate, and other interests. 
And they basically managed to do this. 
  [Buzhkevich] But it still stood up under the demands of the 
agrarians.... 
  [Kalmykov] Not entirely. There are such things as unpaid 
debts. Under conditions of a normal economy and a rule-of-law 
state, they are ruled out because there is a reliable mechanism 
in place for compulsory collection of money from debtors. 
  Everything is different here. The economy is in a transition 
period and it is far from being a normal, market economy. And 
the state has to pay for this. 
  For instance, they say that we must not take on debts and 
subsidize certain branches. They say we must stick to our guns 
for otherwise we will not be able to cope with inflation. From a 
formal economic standpoint this might be true. But there is the 
real situation, the actual pit in which we are all sitting. And 
we have to get out of it. And we have no time for formalities 
because then we will not achieve anything. 
  Of course, we can say to the director of an enterprise: If 
your debtor will not pay, take him to court. But if he does not 
have a shirt on his back, you will not be able to get any money 
from him. Perhaps it is better (half of our enterprises cannot 
declare bankruptcy) to help him, to give him a little support 
through the state. Then you might look and see that the 
enterprise is on its feet. We have already said that we are in a 
transition period. That being the case, the state must exert a 
regulating influence on the situation. That is what President 
Franklin Roosevelt did 60 years ago when the United States was 
establishing a market. 
  I think that our prime minister was right to support the 
petition to allot funds to agriculture, part of which were a 
state debt. How can we leave the peasantry without funds, 
materials, and fuel right before planting. From here it is not 
far to disaster--the country could be left without food and 
other agricultural products. 
  It is another matter when they demand additional credit, and 
at preferential rates. Here again is a manifestation of 
subjective lobbying. 
  Various viewpoints and opinions, mainly regarding concrete 
problems, exist in any government. People frequently say that it 
is a single team and must think the same, they must be playing 
the same song. But that is pure utopia. In government structures 
there are people who think in different ways, and this is 
probably a normal phenomenon. It is important for the government 
to be unified in the main thing, the overall line of behavior.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov, including statement by FITUR </F>
Chairman Mikhail Shmakov, under the rubric "FITUR Position": 
"Champagne for Three... The Skeptics Will Say `It Was That 
Close'"] 
  [Text] Finally! After many assemblies and much 
debate, members of the Russian Trilateral Commission signed the 
General Agreement Between the All-Russian Trade Union and 
Employer Associations and the Russian Federation Government for 
1994. A cheerful atmosphere prevailed in the well-known building 
at Old Square; in what has become a tradition, champagne was 
served (for the third time). 
  Actually, there are enough reasons to be cautious in 
evaluating the events, apart from the desire to malign and 
"cloud." First, this fundamental document in the life of our 
society was too long in coming. Given that it overflows with 
phrases such as "prepare proposals" and "develop drafts," when 
is its effect to be expected? Second, it is known that pickets 
are posted in front of the White House continuously, 
simultaneously with the meeting of the RTK [Russian Trilateral 
Commission]: Nuclear industry workers take over from miners; 
yesterday, textile industry personnel joined in, and 
today--students. We must admit that there is a measure of 
discord in this. Will the discord weaken or disappear? The 
feeling is that the RTK aspires to this. 
  FITUR [Federation of the Independent Trade Unions of Russia] 
Chairman Mikhail Shmakov, head of the trade union delegation 
within the commission, stated this for RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers: 
  "The very fact that an agreement was signed is 
positive: As the economic crisis continues to worsen and 
passions in our society are seething, a step is being taken that 
makes confrontation less likely and safeguards peace in our 
house. 
  "Furthermore, we succeeded in incorporating into the 
text of the General Agreement a sufficiently large number of the 
proposals by trade unions which are designed to protect the 
material interests of the working people. I will say right away 
that this is not all we wanted, but rather the maximum of what 
was possible in reaching a compromise. In particular, a 
provision is included that did not exist before: Decisions to 
use foreign labor in Russia will only be made with the findings 
of associations of trade unions and employers taken into account. 
  "This is the wording of one of our main demands: 'A set 
of measures shall be taken to provide coordinated regulation, 
including by the state, and control over prices (rates) for 
energy resources, individual socially significant foodstuffs 
(regulated at the regional level), principal types of medicinal 
preparations and drugs, the services of passenger and freight 
transportation, communications, municipal and other services to 
the population, and products (goods, services) of monopoly 
enterprises.' 
  "The General Agreement includes a new section 
concerning obligations of the parties with regard to social 
security and social insurance which provides protection measures 
for millions of working people: procedures for payment of 
temporary disability benefits, preservation of the technical and 
legal inspectorate of trade unions, as well as their certified 
physicians, provision of reduced-price sanatorium vouchers for 
low-income categories, and so on. 
  "We did not succeed in pushing through the demand to 
bring the size of the minimum wage to 70 percent of the 
subsistence minimum by the end of the year. (In the last 
agreement, "to 50 percent" was laid down, but actually this 
remained merely a benign wish.) 
  "However, as I see it, the main point is that 
representatives of all the three parties are now proceeding in 
the common direction--toward comprehensive cooperation." 
  Let us knock on wood at this point. At the same time, let us 
recall (inappropriately?): "He is blessed who is a believer...." 
  Oh, I nearly forgot! As the first item, the RTK heard a 
presentation by Deputy Minister of Railways I. Besedin 
concerning a raise in railway rates. Valeriy Ochekurov (Trade 
Union of Forest Rangers) asked him a question: "Can you bring 
down prices for tickets following our discussion here, or have 
we missed the train?" Besedin just threw up his hands, and 
everybody felt somewhat awkward because of their tactless 
colleague.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduard Mokhorov under the rubric "Point of </F>
View": "Economic `Selective Breeders' Have Taken the Country 
Onto a Proven Path, But in the Opposite Direction"] 
  [Text] Bryansk--In his time, a self-taught village 
selective breeder, a former disciple of Michurin, tried to grow 
a new vegetable-fruit unknown to science out of plain potatoes. 
Like its American progenitor, this plant had a root system on 
which potato tubers grew, whereas the surface part was graced 
with tomatoes. I do not remember the name of this selective 
breeder, but I know for sure that the hybrid he produced was 
called the PUKS or, if the abbreviation were to be expanded, 
"Path to Socialism." Of course, you have guessed that this is 
about the notorious "Chonkin" by the venomous writer 
Voynovich. 
  Due to well-known causes and events, our people gave up the 
PUKS after August 1991. We are now producing a new hybrid, 
likewise unknown to science, which is officially called "Path to 
Capitalism," PUKK in short (of course, with two k's at the end). 
All of us, from the president to the common kitchen maid, are 
producing PUKK willy-nilly. Although no one knows what the 
underground-surface part of this hybrid will look like, everyone 
has already managed to fully partake of its fruit. It may very 
well be that, due to our doing everything the other way around, 
the tomatoes will end up in the underground segment while tubers 
will ripen amid rustling tops. 
  Yegor Timurovich Gaydar may be rightfully called the main 
selective breeder of the Russian PUKK. Despite the entire 
fantastic nature of the project, PUKK has turned out to be a 
tenacious hybrid. Despite Gaydar having been removed from his 
favorite agronomic experimentation for a second time now to the 
sound of gun salvos in front of the White House, his PUKK has 
managed to strike root in the very thick of the Russian economy, 
regardless of who is in charge of the selective breeding effort 
at present. 
  They say that this is a sick economy. They frequently liken 
it to a precipice which we need to jump across no matter what. 
We would have jumped across with our characteristic enthusiasm, 
but for three things accompanying PUKK that are getting in the 
way: inflation, the nonpayments crisis, and a universal 
recession in industry. Mass unemployment promises to be the 
fourth evil. 
  The government swears on a daily basis that it is 
fighting these misfortunes that are threatening to blow up our 
society in every way possible. By all signs, the evil would have 
been vanquished had it not been for the agrarians and miners 
taking turns at being bothersome. The most intelligent and 
learned people, from G. Yavlinskiy to B. Kurkova and Granny 
Vanga from Bulgaria, propose fast-acting prescriptions for 
fighting inflation. The discontented segment of the population 
(members and candidates for the underclass) associate the three 
evils plaguing the Russian economy with PUKK and Gaydar. We must 
acknowledge at this point that in this instance, intuition does 
not fail our public. 
  All kinds of abusive words have been hurled at Yegor 
Timurovich in recent years! "Lab chief" is the gentlest of the 
swear words. Meanwhile, Gaydar smiles coolly. He feels 
superiority over the crowd of ignoramuses. None of them has 
understood and appreciated the titanic feats accomplished in two 
years by the father of the Russian PUKK. At best, our irritated 
philistine has noticed a commercial stand opposite his house and 
begun to patronize it on a regular basis in order to buy Dutch 
sausage, Greek oranges, a jar of Brazilian coffee, or a bottle 
of Royale at any time without standing in line. As long as you 
have money, purchasing the erstwhile goods in short supply is 
now everyone's privilege. 
  It appears that everything is just fine now as far as Greek 
oranges are concerned. Now let us try to figure out the things 
that are not at all in plain view but are hidden, like tomatoes, 
in the underground segment of the present-day political economy. 
Those who brand the Gaydar team with infamy for being incapable 
of creative actions in the economic sphere are making a big 
mistake (or perhaps are not being entirely truthful). 
Nonetheless, the blood-curdling cries of conservatives who would 
like to take the country back to PUKS are still being heard. 
Their charges sound trivial: "They have dragged the economy into 
a global crisis, but do not know themselves how to get out of 
it." 
  Comrade conservatives, you are in error! Gaydar knows 
everything. The reform has not failed, as we are being 
persistently told at present; it is rather being successfully 
completed. The endeavor on which Yegor embarked two years ago 
has already been accomplished in the rough. The building has 
been erected; what remains is to take down the scaffolding and 
start finishing the building. In all of that, you, the credulous 
philistines, have been intimidated for over two years in every 
way possible with horrendous shock treatment. However, we have 
done without physicians. This was merely a feint. Highly 
professional butcher-surgeons from the International Monetary 
Fund performed the surgery with precision: We did not even 
manage to shriek. 
  The postoperative pain made itself known when 9.5 out of 10 
Russians found out that the big, tasty-smelling pie of state 
property has been virtually carved up, and none of them 
personally was in any danger of tasting that delicacy. 
  The ideological anesthetic wore off later, and then the 
opened-up society sensed the smell of PUKK: The once united 
Soviet people ended up divided into poor and rich. In the 
process, a narrow stratum of chosen ones ended up in the sun of 
a capitalist paradise on the other side of the precipice, while 
the rest--sovietized creatures, that is, the superfluous, 
unnecessary, and for this reason dangerous elements of 
society--are still awaiting the miraculous leap across the 
precipice which was promised by the prophets of 1991. Miners, 
collective farmers (under whose feet the ground is literally 
giving way at present because it will be taken away at any 
minute) ended up among the sovietized creatures, or the 
superfluous ones. Retirees, the military (with the exception of 
the loyal elite), workers of the military-industrial complex, 
and the working intelligentsia also ended up as such. 
  Therefore, the surgeons have done their job without 
publicizing the results. The rest was up to ideologists, those 
who console and distract. They are trying hard, especially on 
TV. The main point is to be persistent, to tirelessly drum into 
your souls and minds a few magic formulas on a daily basis. You 
never sweated previously, but if they recommend to you a 
patented deodorant day in and day out, you will wake up in a 
cold sweat in the middle of the night on some occasion and, to 
the sound of music playing in your sick head, utter: "Khlavin 
Cosmetics, Israel, Ben Gurion Boulevard." 
  With the same importunate inevitability, specialists in 
political advertisements will impress upon you, gentlemen, 
former Soviet and currently superfluous people, that you have 
not lost all that much by acquiring PUKK. After all, the 
completely illusory guarantees of the old Brezhnev-Soviet 
Constitution were taken away--such as the right to low-paid 
labor and second-grade recreation on a trade union voucher, and 
unskilled medical services. 
  What else was there? Oh, yes: the prospect of being given 
the 
"Labor Veteran" medal and a free "Khrushchevian slum" with a 
view of the belching smokestacks of a plant before one retired. 
In addition, it was demonstrated to the superfluous people on 
TV, on 4 October of last year, that the state which had 
previously protected them from thieves will now protect the 
peace and comfort of the new elite from them, from the 
Sovietized creatures whom nobody has any use for. 
  They are now impressing on all the superfluous people that 
the difficulties they are experiencing are temporary in nature. 
The brainwashing department that has now replaced the agitation 
and propaganda arm of the CPSU Central Committee gently induces 
us to think that inflation is the main enemy (next to the 
Reds-and-Brownshirts) at this stage in history. If we overcome 
this perfidious evil, the Russian people will live no worse than 
the British in their vaunted Lemonia (as is known, this 
geographic discovery was made by Vasiliy Aksenov). 
  However, how is inflation to be overcome, along with the 
other evils of the period of transition? The segment of society 
on whose backs the chosen ones have gotten across to the other, 
promised side of the precipice live with this burden on their 
minds at present. 
  Prescriptions for the struggle have already matured in many 
brilliant revolutionary minds. As far as the miners are 
concerned, they are prepared to act straightforwardly. These 
guys know how to get to the top of their "game" in a cavalier 
manner. Were they not the ones to yell in 1989 louder than 
anyone else: Give us PUKK, and down with the commies? Now they 
are also yelling: "Gaydar is gone, down with Chernomyrdin and 
the president to boot! Since the war, 40 governments have 
changed in Italy, but now they gorge themselves on spaghetti 
with Uncle Ben's sauce every day. We will keep toppling prime 
ministers and presidents until such time as we elect those who 
know how to cancel inflation, corruption, and nonpayments by a 
single decree." To the sound of such inflammatory rhetoric, a 
certain well-known gentleman who is counted among the fascists 
is already walking about and stroking his gilded belly. 
  If we disregard emotions, it would be worthwhile to think 
hard: Yegor is, of course, a "lab chief" and the "Mephisto of 
the Russian economic reform." But how did he manage to produce a 
budget that patched so many gaping holes literally with nothing, 
literally out of thin air, without being distracted for a second 
from his principal objective? 
  This is where we learn Gaydar's main secret. The Russian 
PUKK 
which he has reared and cherished has three sources and three 
components, as Marxists said at one time. You will be very 
surprised, but these are inflation, the nonpayments crisis, and 
a paralysis of the state industrial system. While our liberals 
and conservatives fought the ills of the economy at 
get-togethers and on the pages of the press, Yegor Timurovich 
knew for sure that the treasury was empty, that he would not be 
given credit from overseas, and that his path toward the market, 
i.e. capitalism, could become yet another utopia under the real 
conditions of Russia--the existence of a monolithic community of 
directors and labor collectives which guarded so-called 
all-people's assets like the apple of their eye--unless the 
mechanism of antieconomics operated to counterbalance these 
forces. 
  Yegor Timurovich was not an indecisive tearful 
Bolshevik, one of those who are scared by the forthcoming 
difficulties. Very soon the entire industry of Russia was on its 
last legs due to inflation and the universal plague into which 
the nonpayments crisis had turned. There were no orders. Working 
capital and credit ran out. There was nothing to pay wages with. 
This turned out to be enough for the directors, the erstwhile 
sworn enemies of the elements of the market, to turn into the 
most faithful allies. It was not without their assistance and 
the interested consent of labor collectives that universal 
privatization was completed within mere months. The once 
prosperous standard-bearers of Soviet industry were auctioned 
off at scrap prices. The predominant group thought that they had 
become masters: After all, they struck an advantageous deal and 
got control of half the plant free of charge. However, what is 
to be done next about these shares and about the plant, which 
has no orders? The new-fangled owners do not know it. Instead, 
this is known by the tycoons of private financial corporations, 
although they are in no hurry to make an appearance on 
stage. 
  To some, inflation is worse then the plague. However, to 
Yegor Timurovich and the future owners it has become a mighty 
lever of Archimedes. The crisis ruined many people; but others 
managed to accumulate powerful capital of their own without 
producing anything at all. People who had access to loans, 
licenses, and quotas grew rich playing for the fall of the 
exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar. Drawing on 
inflation and other companion phenomena, the father of the 
Russian PUKK conducted the historical process of primary 
accumulation of capital in Russia in two years. Mother Europe 
needed hundreds of years to accomplish this. 
  To be sure, Gaydar's adversaries have one argument against 
PUKK which is irrefutable in a way. They say that, first, Gaydar 
abandoned regulation in the economy, relying only on the 
elements, and second, neglected a program for social protection 
of the dispossessed. The opponents are in error yet again in 
this instance. Prices, and even the entire economy, were 
regulated by the printing press. 
  I believe that Yegor Timurovich was secretly rubbing his 
hands with glee in all this: His provider, inflation relieved 
the government of many of its past debts and obligations: 
Payments happened to be made with another kind of rubles. In the 
process, Gaydar said publicly: "Guys, I had nothing to do with 
it. You were the ones to demand that the delayed wages be paid, 
you demanded new bonuses; so as a result you got an inflationary 
cycle not planned by the government." 
  Now about the social protection program. Who said that 
Gaydar 
has forgotten the poor, the impoverished, and the indigent, 
retirees, and war veterans? Indeed, inflation swallows our 
money. However, it is a veritable boon to the socially 
unprotected strata of the population. After all, it is precisely 
through inflation and delayed payments that Gaydar has taken 
away from some (we might say from all of us) in order to give to 
others (that is, once again to almost all of us). 
  Besides, under Russian conditions cataclysmic inflation 
is even a humane means to implement unpopular reforms. The 
previous rulers reached into our wallets and passbook accounts 
from time to time, justifying themselves bashfully. However, as 
a rule, such one-time expropriation induced universal shock. 
  Khrushchev raised meat prices (to 2.6 rubles per 
kilogram) just once, pointing to prices abroad. He was not 
forgiven for this fault of his as long as he lived. Brezhnev 
introduced the annual date of 1 April as a merry state holiday 
during which it was allowed to "temporarily" raise individual 
prices. He was not forgiven for that either (and not at all for 
his senile weakness and the golden stars), even after his death. 
Prime Minister Pavlov froze our savings for a few weeks once, 
but where is he now? 
  Unlike all his unpopular predecessors, Yegor Timurovich 
created a system for continuous rather than just one-time 
action. Everything we have managed to receive in the form of 
wages, bonuses, retirement benefits, profits, and dividends is 
now siphoned away from us every second of every day rather than 
just once a year. We cannot name anyone personally as the robber. 
  After all, it is inflation, something like Gogol's elusive 
nose which once abandoned the face of a St. Petersburg official 
and lived autonomously and independently in the surrounding 
space. Gaydar has left the stage, but the nose continues to 
cruise and circulate, sometimes surfacing in a provision of yet 
another edict or under the guise of an important statesman. In 
the process, all of us are frequently left holding our noses. 
  In general terms, inflation now amounts to a powerful 
accelerator of the collapse of state property and the 
establishment of private property. The need for this catalyst 
will no longer exist when the process is completed (in 1991 we 
called ourselves supporters of market reforms, i.e. PUKK, almost 
to a man), when private owners of all plants, minerals, and land 
come along. Inflation will disappear, and a hard currency will 
appear. There will also be firm laws protecting the gains of the 
owners. Believe me, the long-awaited international capital will 
then appear on the Russian stage, too. 
  Russia has not appreciated its great man, Yegor Gaydar. 
Rather than drift as the waves and currents command, he made the 
clumsy, heavy ship of our domestic economy sail into the wind, 
against hostile whirlwinds, tapping in the process the energy of 
the winds and whirlwinds themselves. The people on the deck are 
groaning and cursing. Rolling makes some sick. Some are 
threatening the helmsman with mutiny. However, gentleman, you 
are forgetting that in 1991 you were the ones to give the 
ultimate assignment to the captain: "Give us PUKK!" So, we are 
sailing to the promised country of Lemonia in keeping with it. 
The captain is filling the social order accurately.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Astanin, chairman of the Board of </F>
Directors of the Russian Selling House, by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 
correspondent Mikhail Volkov in Volgograd; date not given: "The 
Russian Selling House Is a Truly Unique Finance Company in 
Russia"] 
  [Text] Why so? Everything is quite simple. The 
Russian Selling House is perhaps the only private finance 
company for now which makes it possible for you, my dear reader, 
to get rid of the fear of having things stolen on a train or 
plane, at a railway terminal, and so on. 
  For example, you live in Vladivostok, and you are about 
to travel to Moscow. How much money does one need for the trip? 
Certainly a full wallet.... However, you will not have this 
problem at all if you become a depositor of the Russian Selling 
House. That is to say, you will pay in the money to its 
Vladivostok office, and as soon as tomorrow, or a month or a 
year from now--whenever you need--you can withdraw all or some 
of your money, but certainly with interest, in Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, or dozens of other cities in Russia and even 
Ukraine.... 
  Aleksandr Astanin, chairman of the Board of Directors of the 
Russian Selling House, began our conversation by saying: "For 
now, only Ukraine outside of Russia. However, we are planning to 
open branches, first throughout nearby foreign countries and 
then in many distant foreign countries. 
  [Volkov] Do you mean to say that you will work with the 
currencies of the former Union republics? 
  [Astanin] Precisely. Potential depositors, for example, in 
Kazakhstan will be given an opportunity to deposit their 
tenge-denominated savings at our local branch and withdraw 
rubles in Russia--naturally, at the exchange rate we set. 
  [Volkov] Aleksandr Valentinovich, it appears to me that you 
yourself are not aware of the full significance of this project. 
I for one am from the so-called near abroad and, as the saying 
goes, have learned the hard way about the problems of the 
segment of the local population which some silly politician 
named "Russian-speaking." Some 30 million Russians who remained 
after the disintegration of the Union in its former republics 
were, in essence, robbed once again after the introduction of 
national currencies. When they leave these states, the money is 
exchanged for them with a lot of friction, or the exchange is 
rejected outright, with references made to a lack of Russian 
rubles. The exchange frequently occurs at locally set, 
unrealistic, extortionate rates. If you succeed in carrying out 
your project, millions of Russians will be forever grateful to 
you. 
  [Astanin] It is no accident that our house is called 
Russian.... However, one would think that this project would be 
advantageous in every sense for the authorities of nearby 
foreign countries, too. First of all, we will relieve them of 
some of the problems of conversion; the population will be 
happy; what else do the authorities need? 
  [Volkov] How do you manage to attract depositors? 
  [Astanin] By absolute trust and the ever present desire to 
comply with the will of our clients. For example, a client 
brings his money to us today, but tomorrow changes his mind and 
wants it back. We will give him the money back right away, but 
with interest for the day. Who else, apart from us, will add the 
daily dividend for him? Incidentally, we have never promised 
people fabulous profits. However, our depositors have always 
known that each 1,000 of their rubles "gains" 3 rubles [R] per 
day, and effective 1 March of this year we "threw in" another R2 
on our own. From now on, each R1,000 invested yields R5 per day 
to our clients. I will stress--it is R5 per day, with a 
100-percent guarantee of receipt of the invested funds in full 
and with interest immediately upon demand in virtually any city 
in Russia. 
  [Volkov] In Volgograd, the "cradle" of the Russian Selling 
House, the company has not, so to say, always been in the 
clover.... 
  [Astanin] Correct. At first they looked askance at us; some 
members of officialdom viewed us disapprovingly: What if the 
leaders of the company "make tracks" for foreign lands with the 
cherished attache case? However, the Russian Selling House has 
never intended to swindle anyone. On the contrary, in April of 
last year we indexed the deposits of the population by 30 
percent at once. The house invested and is still investing its 
spare funds in real estate and many other things that will not 
be carried abroad in any manner. I will now divulge just one 
commercial secret: We own real estate throughout Russia on a far 
greater scale than some companies that specialize in this. It 
appears that something is afoot in Volgograd, too. 
  [Volkov] Indeed, at a recent press conference the governor 
of 
the oblast stated that he is not against selling to your company 
an unfinished hotel building downtown--the sickening 
construction project without an end. 
  [Astanin] We will be happy to buy this "masterpiece" of 
Soviet industry and turn it into a "dandy." Of course, it is 
nonetheless quite offensive, in human terms, that they took so 
long to accommodate us, and what did this result in? A few days 
ago two well-known soccer teams played at the local stadium, the 
Rotor and the Uralmash.... Who would you have us root for? For 
our Rotor from Volgograd, or for the visitor Uralmash, which our 
company bought not so long ago? 
  [Volkov] Nonetheless, as you put it, something is afoot in 
Volgograd. But what about other regions? 
  [Astanin] We find good shelter almost everywhere. They know 
about us, and local leaders very frequently facilitate our 
"acclimation" in every way possible. Difficulties with the 
central departments continue. To this day we have been unable to 
get a license in Moscow. The Central Bank passes off all our 
letters to the Ministry of Finance, and the latter passes them 
off to the Central Bank. We intend to finally break the vicious 
circle. We will take the matter to the courts. Besides, we will 
open several banks at once in the large cities of Russia. 
  [Volkov] Are these the immediate prospects? 
  [Astanin] The most immediate. At the same time, we resolved 
to invest funds in establishing powerful facilities in the 
construction industry (we are projecting a construction "boom" 
by the end of the 1990's), the development of communications, 
transportation, and many other economically advantageous 
projects. 
  [Volkov] Therefore, you plan your operations, do you not? 
  [Astanin] Definitely. This is a guarantee of success and the 
necessary condition for founders, who are young and energetic. 
S. Gruzin and A. Solomadin were there at the outset of the 
Russian Selling House, and at present they are the originators 
of most if not all fruitful ideas that sustain the company. I am 
not afraid to say that it is precisely due to planning our work, 
both in the long run and on a daily basis, that we have more 
than 1 million depositors and a wonderful infrastructure all 
over Russia, that we are establishing contacts with various 
countries, and that we have provided jobs for 10,000 people. To 
be sure, we are not the trailblazers in this area: Japanese and 
American businessmen have always planned their operations....

<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  The current index of prices for consumer goods and 
services measured 108.7 percent in March, including for 
foodstuffs--106.2 percent, nonfood items--111.3 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--114.6 percent. 
  Since the beginning of the year, prices for goods and 
services have increased by 44.5 percent, including for 
foodstuffs--by 40.6 percent, nonfood items--by 37.6 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--2.3-fold. 
  Over the period 22 to 29 March, prices for goods and 
services rose by 1.8 percent, including for foodstuffs--by 1.2 
percent, nonfood items--by 2.6 percent, and for-fee services for 
the population--by 1.6 percent. The highest rate of 
increases in prices for goods and services was registered in 
cities of the East Siberian economic region (4 percent), and the 
lowest--in the Volgo-Vyatka region (0.8 percent). 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services were as 
follows: 


                 (as % of the preceding observation date):

vegetables 


  As during the preceding week, over the period 22 to 29 March 
vegetable prices in organized trade rose at an 
anticipatory rate: onions--by 15 percent, fresh cabbage--by 9 
percent, and carrots--by 7 percent. High rates of price 
increases persisted with respect to frozen fish, salt, and some 
varieties of cereals (4-7 percent). There was practically no 
change over the week in prices for poultry meat, butter, sugar, 
eggs, bread, vodka, and potatoes. 
  Over the month of March vegetable prices went up by 26 
percent; those for frozen fish--by 23 percent; bread, bakery 
products, and cereals--by 12-14 percent; milk products--by 10 
percent; and meat and meat products--by 6 percent. There was a 
considerable increase over the month in the price of salt (28 
percent). 
  Similarly to organized trade, the greatest price increases 
in 
nonorganized trade were registered with respect to 
fresh produce: prices for onions went up by 6 percent, fresh 
cabbage--by 7 percent, and garlic--by 32 percent. With respect 
to other products, there was practically no change. Since the 
beginning of the month vegetable prices have gone up by 22 
percent, and those for meat and milk products remained 
practically unchanged. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs increased over the week by 1.4 percent and as of 
29 March amounted to 44,300 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured 
a factor of 4. In terms of the cost of consumer basket, St. 
Petersburg and Moscow ranked 34th and 39th among 132 monitored 
cities (R49,200 and R48,000 on a monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood items. </H5>
  Prices for basic medicines increased over the week by 6.6 
percent, and for fabrics--by 3.4 percent. Prices for light 
industry goods increased by 1.7-2.8 percent. 
  Over the month of March prices for medicines increased by 24 
percent; fabrics--by 14 percent; garments, knitwear, and 
household and cultural goods--by 10-11 percent; footwear--by 7 
percent, and tobacco items--by 4 percent. 
<H5>  For-fee services for the population. </H5>
  Over the week there were no substantial changes in the cost 
of for-fee services for the population. 
  Over the month the greatest rate increases were registered 
with respect to municipal housing and hot water (1.5-fold). In 
some cities (Krasnoyarsk, Petrozavodsk) local administrative 
bodies made the decision to postpone putting in effect new rates 
for municipal services. The cost of city bus fares rose over the 
month by 31 percent, and that of services of cultural 
establishments and some categories of consumer services--by 
22-28 percent.

<H5>  Export and Import Through Barter Operations </H5>
  According to Russian Goskomstat [State Committee on 
Statistics] data, Russia's barter (exchange of goods not 
involving monetary payments) turnover with far abroad foreign 
countries in 1993 amounted to $8.678 billion and increased as 
compared to 1992 by 30 percent, including $4.941 billion worth 
of exports (by 37 percent) and $3.737 worth of imports (by 22 
percent). 
  The value of barter operations is estimated either at world 
prices or at prices of individual deals for similar goods. 
  Of the total volume of Russia's export-import operations in 
1993, barter accounted for: exports--11.5 percent (8.5 percent 
in 1992); imports--13.8 percent (8.3 percent in 1992). 
  The predominant items in barter exports were raw materials 
and semifinished goods (about 70 percent); received in exchange 
were consumer goods (more than 60 percent).

barter

  Russia's barter operations turnover with China in 1993 
amounted to $2.965 billion (34 percent of the total volume of 
barter turnover); with Germany--$526 million (6.1 percent); 
Switzerland--$412 million (4.7 percent); Hungary--$296 million 
(3.4 percent); Great Britain--$250 million (2.9 percent); the 
Netherlands--$238 million (2.7 percent); and the United 
States--$227 million (2.6 percent). 
<H5>  Housing Conditions of the Population </H5>
  As of the beginning of 1994, 9.1 million families, or 18 
percent of all families, were on waiting lists of local 
authorities, enterprises, and organizations for housing. As 
compared to the preceding year, the number of families on the 
waiting list in Russia as a whole dropped by 542,000. 
  Of the total number of families on housing waiting lists in 
Russia, 15 percent live in communal apartments, 13 percent--in 
dormitories, and 4 percent--in decrepit and dilapidated housing; 
15 percent have been on the waiting list for 10 or more years. 
  In 1993, 897,000 families, or 51,000 fewer than in 1992, 
received housing or improved their living conditions; of them, 
826,000 had been on waiting lists; 828,000 new families were put 
on waiting lists and 640,000 removed for a variety of reasons. 
  The dynamics of improvement in the population's living 
conditions over a number of years are characterized by the 
following data:

<H5>  Status of Coal Production in Main Coal Basins </H5>
  In 1993 production of coal in Russia as a whole and in the 
main coal basins continued to decline. Indicators that 
characterize the situation with the main coal basins in 1993 are 
shown in the table below:

  The decline in the volume of coal production stems to a 
considerable extent from the diminished investment in sector 
development. In 1993 alone the volume of capital investment from 
all sources of financing has dropped as compared to 1992 by 25 
percent. 
  The shortage of money speeded up the process of shrinkage of 
the coal production base. Over 1991-1993, as a result of 
depletion of deposits and changes in mining and geological 
conditions, capacities for production of 78.6 million tonnes of 
coal went off line, while capacities for production of only 21.2 
million tonnes were put on line, including for 20.8 million 
tonnes and 6.8 million tonnes in 1993, respectively. 
  Higher prices for the coal produced do not solve the problem 
of lack of money to invest in sector development. In 1993 coal 
prices grew as compared to 1992 10.2-fold, while rates for 
railroad freight increased 18.2-fold. 
  Nonpayments for products shipped keep growing. The total 
amount of coal enterprises' accounts receivable as of 1 January 
1994 amounted to R1.1 trillion. As of 1 March 1994, 20.2 million 
tonnes of coal had accumulated at coal-producing enterprises' 
warehouses, which is twice as high as the norm. 
  Loss of work time as a result of strikes is increasing. 
While 
in 1992 it amounted to 91,000 man-days, in 1993 the number grew 
to 140,000, of which 64,000 were lost in January-February of 
this year. 
  The decline in coal production is to a large degree a result 
of the reduction in the volume of preparatory work and the 
resulting diminished front of mineral extraction work. In 1993 
the volume of opening and preparation work declined as compared 
to 1992 in Russia as a whole by 12 percent, including at 
Kuznetsk Basin enterprises by 13 percent, at the Primorskugol 
association--by 16 percent, at Severovostokugol--by 17 percent, 
while at the Yakutugol association it increased by 11 percent. 
The average operating length of stoping faces decreased by 7 
percent, including at Kuznetsk Basin--by 10 percent, and 
Severovostokugol--by 26 percent. The level of labor 
mechanization in the sector is falling. The proportional share 
of coal production in faces with hydraulically operated lining 
where integrated mechanization is used fell from 84 percent in 
1994 to 80 percent in 1993. Maritime Kray and Sakhalin mines 
remain the least mechanized--the share of coal produced by the 
aforementioned kind of faces there comprised 52 percent and 57 
percent in 1993, respectively. 
  In January-February of this year 50.3 million tonnes of coal 
was produced in the Russian Federation, which is 8 percent less 
than over the analogous period of last year, including in the 
Kuznetsk Basin--10 percent less, Donetsk--5 percent less, and 
the Far East--23 percent less. Production of coal in the Pechora 
Basin increased by 3 percent, and in Kansk-Achinsk--by 7 percent. 
<H5>  Material and Technical Base of Farmers Markets </H5>
  As of the beginning of the current year, 1,874 farmers 
markets were operating in the Russian Federation. As compared to 
the beginning of 1993 their number declined by 111 (6 percent). 
  Of the total number of markets, 57 percent were the property 
of consumer cooperatives, 24 percent were state-owned, 15 
percent--privately owned, and 4 percent were of mixed ownership. 
  The status of the material and technical base of farmers 
markets is characterized by the following data:

  Currently, one out of every four markets are of the enclosed 
variety. There are no enclosed markets in the republics of Tuva, 
Karachay-Cherkessia, Kostroma, Tula, and Astrakhan Oblasts, and 
Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast. Half of the markets are not 
equipped with mechanically powered refrigerating equipment. On 
average there are only two mechanically powered refrigerators 
per market, one cooler or one refrigeration chamber. One out of 
two markets does not have a veterinary and health inspection 
laboratory. 
  Hotels and farmers boarding facilities exist only at one out 
of 20 markets (of them, one-quarter are in Moscow and 9 percent 
in St. Petersburg). 
<H5>  Consumer Services Enterprises </H5>
  As of the beginning of 1994 in Russia the organs of state 
statistics counted officially on record 86,556 consumer services 
enterprises of all forms of property, which is 5 percent fewer 
than a year ago--a result of the liquidation of some of them. 
  The distribution of consumer services enterprises by form of 
ownership as of 1 January 1994 is characterized by the following

  The share of the private sector is higher among enterprises 
engaged in custom shoe-making (45 percent of the number of 
facilities providing this service), shoe repair (47 percent), 
and beauty salons (45 percent). 
<H5>  Serving Passengers in Intercity Transportation </H5>
  The organs of state statistics have conducted a selective 
survey of the quality of passenger service in airports and on 
airplanes, at railroad stations and on long-distance trains. The 
sample of passengers who answered the questionnaire at railroad 
stations and long-distance trains included 1,643 persons, and in 
airports and airplanes--703 persons. 
  The survey showed that quality of service, which should be a 
decisive criteria of an enterprise's ability to compete, 
currently remains low.

  At railroads only one half of the respondents had been able 
to purchase train tickets at advance ticket sale facilities; 39 
percent of respondents were able to do so only at the ticket 
window at the station on the day of departure. In doing this, 
873 persons (53 percent) spent more than half an hour waiting in 
line for the tickets, and of them, 272 persons (17 percent) 
spent between one and three hours, and 113 persons (7 percent) 
more than three hours. 
  Long waiting lines at rail station ticket windows (between 
one and three hours) was noted by many passengers in Kursk, 
Saransk, Moscow, Tambov, Kirov, Volgograd, and Samara; more than 
three hours--in Tambov, Kirov, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Saransk. 
  Passenger complaints regarding the operation of ticket 
windows note first and foremost the tactless behavior of ticket 
window personnel (41 percent dissatisfied), as well as the fact 
that they were offered a different category of car (26 percent), 
not the train they wanted (13 percent), or a different departure 
date (14 percent). 
  Unmet demand for rail tickets gives rise to abuses: 107 
persons (6.5 percent) had to buy tickets from scalpers. The 
greatest number of such instances was noted in Saransk (18), 
Tambov (12), Lipetsk (8), and Kirov (6). Shortage of rail 
tickets is frequently created artificially or arises from poor 
organization of ticket window operations. This is supported by 
the fact that 284 persons (42 percent of the number of those 
dissatisfied with ticket window operations) noted a great number 
of vacant seats on the train while no tickets had been available 
at the window. Many such instances were noted especially on 
trains departing from Saransk, Moscow, Kirov, Tambov, 
Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk, and Astrakhan. 
  Two-thirds of the survey respondents--1,085 persons--were 
dissatisfied with waiting hall operations. The greatest number 
of complaints (68 percent of those dissatisfied) were prompted 
by the fact that waiting halls are overcrowded--people have to 
sit on the floor and on their luggage--as well as stations' 
unsatisfactory sanitary conditions (66 percent). An especially 
great number of passengers noted the crowded waiting halls at 
rail stations of Vologda, Orenburg, Ulyanovsk, Rostov-na-Donu, 
Tyumen, Khabarovsk, Cheboksary, Saransk, Orel, Tambov, 
Vladivostok, Kazan, and Moscow; and unsanitary conditions--in 
Arkhangelsk, Saransk, Khabarovsk, Astrakhan, Volgograd, St. 
Petersburg, Yaroslavl, Vladivostok, Ivanovo, Kostroma, Moscow, 
Krasnoyarsk, and Orenburg. 
  More than 1,000 respondents were dissatisfied with the 
organization of public catering at stations. The situation is 
worst with respect to this service in Cheboksary, Saransk, 
Krasnodar, Stavropol, Vladivostok, Lipetsk, Tyumen, Izhevsk, 
Tomsk, Kazan, Novgorod, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Petrozavodsk, 
Yekaterinburg, Belgorod, Ryazan, Pskov, and Blagoveshchensk. 
  Of almost 500 persons who needed to use mother-and-child 
facilities, only 44 percent were able to do so. 
  Most passengers who participated in the survey traveled in 
sleeping compartment (36 percent) and regular sleeping (50 
percent) cars. The condition of cars left 714 persons, or almost 
half of all respondents, dissatisfied. Of them, the overwhelming 
majority (69 percent) pointed out the unsanitary conditions of 
restrooms; one half noted malfunctioning lighting, electric 
outlets, or wire radio; 37 percent--unsatisfactory ventilation 
of rail cars; 33 percent--dirt in passageways; and 30 
percent--unavailability of boiled water. 
  The greatest number of complaints regarding the unsanitary 
condition of trains was voiced with respect to trains operated 
by the Moscow, Gorkiy, and Baykal-Amur Railroads; various 
malfunctions of doors, windows, and various equipment--on trains 
operated by the Moscow, North-Caucasus, Sverdlovsk, Transbaykal, 
and Baykal-Amur Railroads. 
  Half of surveyed passengers were not offered tea on the 
train. More than three-quarters of passengers were not provided 
this elementary service on the trains operated by the Volga, 
West-Siberian, Far-Eastern, and Baykal-Amur Railroads. 
  Only 162 persons, or less than 10 percent of respondents, 
used the services of the dining car (on-board food service 
counter). Of them, 63 percent were left unsatisfied with the 
quality and assortment of food, and 36 percent encountered poor 
service. The greatest complaints were noted with respect to 
operation of dining cars on trains operated by the Moscow, 
Kyubyshev, South-Urals, and Far-Eastern Railroads. 
  In air transportation, despite considerable fare increases 
the population's demand for transportation is still not fully 
met. For instance, 31 percent of surveyed passengers were not 
able to purchase a ticket for the departure date they wanted, 
and 22 percent--for the desired flight. At the same time, 46 
percent of respondents noted that while no tickets were 
available at the ticket window, there were vacant seats in the 
aircraft cabin. Eight percent of passengers spent more than 
three hours in order to purchase tickets; 7 percent spent 
between one and three hours, 19 percent--between 30 and 60 
minutes, and 66 percent--less than 30 minutes. 
  As a result of lines and tactless ticket window clerks, 33 
percent of passengers expressed dissatisfaction with this 
service. A great number of complaints were voiced by passengers 
in Voronezh, Kazan, Groznyy, Kurgan, Irkutsk, Kyzyl, 
Vladivostok, Tyumen, Blagoveshchensk, and Krasnodar. 
  Passenger service at airports is also characterized by low 
quality. These days, when scheduled flights are frequently 
canceled and passengers forced to spend several days at the 
airport waiting for their flight due to disruptions in fuel 
deliveries, the problem of quality service is especially acute. 
The survey showed that airport services cope poorly with this 
task. More than half of surveyed passengers were dissatisfied 
with waiting halls operations; of them, 49 percent noted 
overcrowding, 64 percent--unsatisfactory sanitary conditions, 25 
percent--malfunctioning ventilation and lighting, and 27 
percent--too few restrooms. Unsatisfactory operation of 
communication services at airports was noted by 47 percent of 
passengers; of them, 35 percent noted too few functioning 
long-distance telephones, 44 percent--poor organization of 
coin-changing operation, and 15 percent--no facilities to send a 
cable. Operation of airport information kiosks was found 
unsatisfactory by 30 percent of respondents. Half of the 
passengers encountered poor luggage handling, of whom 25 percent 
noted difficulties encountered in checking luggage at the 
checkroom, 37 percent--absence of automatic storage lockers, and 
52 percent--long wait for luggage after the flight; 42 percent 
of passengers had their luggage damaged or lost in 
transportation. 
  Especially low quality of service was noted at airports in 
the following cities: Groznyy, Samara, Yakutsk, Gorno-Altaysk, 
Magadan, Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk, Makhachkala, and Kurgan. 
  Passengers these days also get minimal convenience and 
comfort on board the aircraft as well. Of passengers 
dissatisfied with the condition of the aircraft cabin, 43 
percent pointed out unsatisfactory sanitary conditions, 78 
percent--malfunctioning passenger seats, lighting, and 
ventilation, and 32 percent--unsatisfactory condition of 
lavatories. 
  Especially many complaints regarding the condition of the 
aircraft cabin came from passengers flying on aircraft of the 
Domodedovo production association (59 percent of respondents) 
and enterprises that are part of the Yakutsk (50 percent), 
Southern (40 percent), and Komi (38 percent) regional civil 
aviation administrations. 
  The most common service offered to passengers aboard 
aircraft 
was refreshments (this service was offered to 69 percent of 
respondents). In addition, 29 percent were offered newspapers 
and magazines, 15 percent--souvenirs, 6 percent--board games, 
and 1 percent--a video to view. One-fifth of passengers were 
offered no services at all.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Stepanov: "Over the Air Waves -- the </F>
`Deputy's Daybreak': Freedom of Speech Does Not Have Long to 
Live"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has taken decisive action to carry 
out a program for the radical brainwashing of the citizens. For 
this purpose a decree is being prepared, to create a special 
Duma television company, and a law that requires the state SMI 
[mass media] to publish the "acts" enacted by that house is 
already practically finished. 
  The need for the law is obvious: the Duma enacted a decree 
on 
amnesty, but it proved to be unable legally to implement it, 
that is, to promulgate it. This time Speaker Rybkin proved to be 
in luck. The execution of his desire depended not upon an honest 
procurator, but upon the lady who manages a newspaper that does 
not belong to the Duma. In general, the little problem was 
worked out and the little matter was settled. (On the eve of the 
amnesty, true, V. Isakov, a farsighted strategist in the 
opposition, attempted to push through a piece of paper to the 
effect that the Duma was authorizing itself to promulgate its 
own decisions in state newspapers.) In one way or another, the 
Duma is preparing a federal law to assure the prompt 
promulgation of its statements. But, pending the approval of 
that law by the Security Council and the president, there 
remains the danger that one of the editors in chief might refuse 
to publish the Duma's opinions in his newspaper. 
  As for television, the situation is even more interesting. 
On 
the one hand, the state does not have any money for 
broadcasting, and, on the other hand, it is proposed that the 
Duma television and radio company will be given air time every 
day (that's right, every day!) up to 45 minutes of prime time. 
Obviously at the expense of the state television and radio 
companies. Why should the taxpayer have to spend money? Well, 
because the journalists, in the deputies' opinion, just as they 
did during the Khasbulatov days, came to an understanding, are 
expressing "incorrect" opinions, and are asking questions not of 
those who have accumulated a greater number of them. Obviously, 
no consideration is being taken of the fact that the Duma 
deputies, even without decrees, appear regularly on television. 
The citizens can have absolutely no desire to see their deputies 
and faction leaders on the screen (although they are paying for 
this!), but the election is almost upon us and, under the sauce 
of Duma news, political associations can carry out their 
campaigns at no cost to themselves. Can anyone refuse that? 
  The question of who will manage the Duma's television 
service 
would seem to be unessential if the person who was accepted 
promptly into the Duma's press center in the position of the 
head of the television and radio sector had not been Yuriy 
Marechenkov, who had been the manager of Khasbulatov's press 
service and whose television creation "Parliamentary Hour" is 
still alive in the memory of television viewers. 
  This is, however, only one side of the problem. The other 
side -- how the Duma can make itself safe against criticism -- 
also has not failed to attract attention. A Duma decree on how 
the mass media are supposed to illumine its activities has 
already been enacted. Soon there will be a federal law, entitled 
"Procedure for Illumining the Activities of State Agencies of 
Authority in the State Mass Media," and a new wording of the law 
entitled "Television and Radio Broadcasting" (the law will be 
reviewed in the Duma in late April). 
  The only thing that is completely unclear for the time being 
is how the Duma plans to conceal these charms behind such a big 
smoke screen.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Kachkayeva under the rubric "Recurrence": </F>
"TV Is Still Outside the Law. Could This Be for the Better?"] 
  [Text] Last week, the Union of Journalists of Russia, the 
Glasnost Defense Fund, and the Committee in Defense of Freedom 
of Speech and Rights of Journalists held hearings on the draft 
Regulations on the Federal Service for Television and Radio 
Broadcasting of Russia. The Federal Service, which was 
established by an edict of the president in December 1993, 
became the successor of the Ministry of the Press and the 
Federal Information Center. As the regulations show, it did not 
just inherit but also multiplied the functions of the two 
predecessor organizations. The text betrays a certain nostalgic 
desire to recreate some kind of Ministry of Propaganda. 
  As the anonymous authors think, the new agitation and 
propaganda arm will not just control, verify, and issue and 
revoke licenses but also monitor off-budget funding for TV and 
radio companies and analyze the content of audio and visual 
materials, which may be interpreted as the introduction of 
censorship. 
  The duties of the chairman are as specific as can be: The 
chairman of the Federal Service may directly influence the 
information policy of the state because he is granted the 
absolute right to appoint and dismiss the heads of all-Russian 
state broadcasting and regional TV and radio companies, as well 
as approve regulations on territorial TV and radio broadcasting 
services. 
  This cannot fail to remind us of the rigid pyramid of the 
State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting with its 
local committees still before the federal era! 
  The new centralized organ is ready to extend its influence 
to 
independent TV and radio companies. As Igor Malashenko, general 
director of the NTV [Independent Television] independent TV 
company, put it, only the right to mint its own coins is not set 
forth in this "delirious" text. 
  As is usually the case, such documents see the light of day 
under quite mysterious circumstances. The text of the 
regulations was discussed with bewilderment at a conference of 
chiefs of regional TV and radio companies; thereafter, it 
accidentally ended up in the committee for defending the rights 
and freedoms of journalists. It came out at the hearings that 
the authors of the regulations have not been found. The 
preparers did not wish to show up at the discussion of their own 
creation, either. So, it is still unclear who penned the 
document. 
  The management of the Federal Service has stated that it has 
nothing to do with this opus. According to Kirill Ignatyev, 
chairman of the Subcommittee for Television and Radio 
Broadcasting of the parliamentary Information Committee, 
Aleksandr Yakovlev said in a conversation with him that the 
draft regulations are actually the "typist's version." 
Apparently, the "typist" is the proverbial "fall guy" with whom 
Russians are so familiar. 
  Representatives of the parliamentary committee, the court 
chamber for information disputes, state and nonstate TV and 
radio broadcasting companies from Moscow and the regions, 
experts, and journalists were of the same mind: The document 
contradicts existing legislation and broadcasting practices to 
such a degree and, in essence, violates the right to freedom of 
information that serious discussion of it is out of the question. 
  However, the opinion on the regulations expressed at the 
hearings is, after all, emotional in nature, it is called upon 
to put the authorities on notice about what the community of 
journalists thinks. It does not at all mean that the Regulations 
on the Federal Service, which are "making the rounds" of Kremlin 
offices and, according to some information, collecting 
endorsements, will not become official. Their circulation may be 
a trial balloon floated in order to determine the attitude 
toward the maximum program, some details of which may later be 
abandoned. 
  Therefore, it is premature to close the discussion, all the 
more so because participants in the hearing familiarized 
themselves with the draft of a new edict of the president, 
according to which the Federal Service should be abolished, 
along with the Committee for the Press. It is planned that a new 
Federal Information Service of Russia will be established 
instead of them which will coordinate the activities of 
newspapers, television, radio, information agencies, and 
publishing houses. If the draft edict is to be believed, it will 
be headed by the already mentioned Aleksandr Yakovlev. 
  P.S. Early last week quite a number of other documents 
associated with television and radio were discussed at the 
Russian-American Information Press Center: the draft laws on 
television and radio broadcasting, on federal communications, on 
state protectionist measures with regard to the mass media, and 
on procedures for coverage of the activities of organs of state 
power by state-owned mass media. All of them drew many 
bewildered questions from those in attendance. To be sure, 
lawyers who were conducting this meeting "reassured" the 
audience: The Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting (as well 
as other legislative acts) will hardly be passed by the current 
membership of the State Duma. Apparently, television will have 
to exist, just as before, outside of the law. Who knows--it 
might be for the better, especially if we take into account the 
imperfection--to put it mildly--of most documents submitted to 
the public for judgment.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kobich: "Lawsuits by Vladimir </F>
Zhirinovskiy Against the Mass Media: The Deputy Denies His KGB 
Connection"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Deputy of the State Duma Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy filed all at once five lawsuits for protection of 
his honor and dignity against various mass media at the 
Savelovskiy, Ostankinskiy, and Presnenskiy Courts of Moscow. The 
deputy priced the moral damage he suffered at 1.5 billion rubles 
[R] (the amounts of the lawsuits range from R100 million to R500 
million). Meanwhile, three other lawsuits by the LDPR 
[Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] are already being 
considered by the courts. Mr. Zhirinovskiy is demanding 
compensation for the moral damage inflicted on him by 
unsubstantiated accusations of being a fascist and cooperating 
with the state security organs. 
  According to Mr. Zhirinovskiy's attorney, Sergey Belyak, his 
client brought the first lawsuit for protection of honor and 
dignity against the POSTFACTUM agency, the newspaper MOSKOVSKAYA 
PRAVDA, and former LDPR comrades-in-arms Yevgeniy Smirnov and 
Vladimir Bogachev. As early as 1990 they disseminated a leaflet 
in which they called Mr. Zhirinovskiy "a KGB secret associate 
and adventurer." MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA published, quoting 
POSTFACTUM, an interview with Mr. Bogachev in which similar 
expressions were used. However, in January 1993 proceedings in 
the case were postponed indefinitely. Zyuzinskiy Court Judge 
Galina Rodina was unable to evaluate the meaning of the words 
"seksot" (secret associate) and "adventurer." The records of the 
case were submitted to the Institute of the Russian Language for 
expert review. In the opinion of Mr. Belyak, rumors about Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy being a KGB agent started at that moment. Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy has already collected through the courts R20,000 
from the STOLITSA magazine and R50,000 from the newspaper 
ROSSIYA over such charges. 
  At present, Mr. Zhirinovskiy is defending his honor and 
dignity in two other courts. On 21 March proceedings were 
postponed in a case instituted against MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, 
which had accused Mr. Zhirinovskiy of having a KGB connection 
since his college years. Sergey Belyak stated that the case may 
be resolved amicably if the newspaper publishes a refutation. On 
25 March proceedings were postponed in a case instituted against 
the newspaper MOSCOW TRIBUNE because of the failure of the 
author of the article, Colleen Sanders, to appear. In a report 
on his visit to the LDPR, Mr. Sanders stated that there were 
people wearing SS uniforms in Zhirinovskiy's entourage who were 
"cocking automatic rifles." The attorney maintains that the LDPR 
Statute does not call for armed units and fascist symbols. 
  Yesterday, Mr. Zhirinovskiy filed a lawsuit at Ostankinskiy 
Court against the RGTRK [All-Russian State Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Company] Ostankino and Oleg Kalugin, who stated in 
the documentary "Hawk" shown on the eve of the elections to the 
State Duma that Zhirinovskiy was a recruited agent of Soviet 
special services. Moral damage to the LDPR leader was evaluated 
to be R300 million. Mr. Zhirinovskiy filed two lawsuits in 
Savelovskiy Court: against the VIP magazine and Anatoliy Sobchak 
(the amount of the lawsuit is R300 million), who believes that 
the LDPR "is a typical creature of the KGB," as well as against 
the VTRK [All-Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting 
Corporation], and Yegor Gaydar, who said in one of the 
broadcasts that Zhirinovskiy reminded him of "Hitler in 1929." 
Two lawsuits by Mr. Zhirinovskiy were lodged with Presnenskiy 
Court. The first is against the TV company NTV [Independent 
Television] and Andrey Kozyrev (for R300 million), who 
attributed to Mr. Zhirinovskiy the phrase "Russians above all" 
and on this basis accused him of being a fascist. The second 
lawsuit names the newspaper KURANTY (the amount of this lawsuit 
is R100 million), to which Mr. Zhirinovskiy allegedly stated 
that "clan and tribal societies" (the Balts, Tajiks, and Uzbeks) 
should starve rather than live at the expense of Russians. 
Sergey Belyak noted that the General Procuracy has instituted a 
criminal case against his client for war propaganda (see 
KOMMERSANT, 27 January 1994) on the basis of this publication, 
as well as the book "The Final Thrust Southward."

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "You Will Feel Like a </F>
Civilized Person: Federal Counterintelligence Service Fits Into 
Statute"] 
  [Text] The Statute on the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS], signed by the president on 5 January 1994, has 
been protected from outsiders' eyes until now by the "For 
Official Use Only" designation. This designation is not part of 
the law on state secrets, but continues to perform its service 
in some agencies along with the "Not For Publication" stamp. 
Therefore we learn what kind of special service taxpayers are 
financing almost four months later, when the absurd designation 
is removed from the statute and the FCS' organizational 
development is already complete. 
  This is how "imperceptibly" Russia took its first step down 
the path to creating a civilized special service. We also have 
to name the project's authors. Most likely we should count as 
such former FCS Director Nikolay Golushko, Security Council 
Secretary Oleg Lobov, Sergey Stepashin, and Yuriy Baturin, 
although the latter joined the "process" at a later stage. And 
it will be Sergey Stepashin, FCS current director, who will have 
to prove that the mechanisms offered by him, first, will work, 
and second, are civilized. 
  In the uncivilized category in the former organs was the 
ability to conduct political surveillance. On the other hand, 
over the past few months the MB [Ministry of Security] was 
constantly being accused of reluctance to take on radical groups 
and inability to keep the president and society informed in a 
timely manner on the political situation in the country. Such 
criticisms were heard after 1 May 1993, when an OMON [Special 
Designation Militia Detachment] soldier was killed, and after 
the events of 3-4 October, at which Barkashov commandos 
appeared. The authors of the statute defined this sphere of FCS 
activities very delicately as "suppression of illegally created 
or banned public associations encroaching on the constitutional 
system of the Russian Federation." Also, they included it in the 
same point as "combating terrorism, illegal arms distribution 
and drug trafficking, and illegal armed formations," which 
indirectly indicates the administration to which the transformed 
functions of the former Fifth--ideological--Directorate for 
Protection of Constitutional System will be transferred. In 
addition, according to the statute, among FCS tasks now are: 
  --counteracting foreign special services; 
  --obtaining information on threats to the Russian Federation 
security; 
  --providing this information to the president; 
  --protecting state secrets; 
  --counterintelligence support for state borders. 
  The FCS staff is set at 75,000 persons, although Stepashin 
himself considers this figure inadequate; the statute gives him 
the right to submit to the president a proposal to increase it. 
  According to the statute these thousands of 
counterintelligence officers are divided into military 
counterintelligence organs in the armed services, and 
territorial organs. Also, their independence from local bodies 
of authority is emphasized. There is also a separate point that 
emphasizes FCS independence from the legislative branch: Point 
3--"The FCS is subordinated directly to the president of the 
Russian Federation." There is not a word in the statute about 
the parliament. One can easily foresee great arguments in the 
future around this point. Quite possibly this summer the State 
Duma will be adopting the law on the FCS, similar to the law on 
foreign intelligence, already in effect since 11 August 1992. In 
the new draft law the deputies will probably attempt to move 
away from such a categorical wording, at least closer to the one 
written in the law on the FIS [Foreign Intelligence Service]: 
"The general leadership of foreign intelligence organs is 
carried out by the Russian Federation president." 
  In addition to general provisions, tasks, and functions, the 
statute sets forth the special service's administrative organs. 
It is "headed by the director, appointed to the job and relieved 
from the job by the Russian Federation president." The director, 
his deputies, as well as several other high-ranking officials 
comprise the FCS collegium, which "considers and makes decisions 
by simple vote on the most important issues. The director, 
however, has power of veto." 
  The productivity (that is, what kind, how much, and the 
quality of information the president will receive) of the new 
special service is limited by the financial abilities of the 
state. At a press conference on Friday Sergey Stepashin for the 
first time announced approximate figures for his service's 
budget. "All in all" it is envisaged to appropriate for the FCS 
"about 700-800 billion--up to 1 trillion rubles [R]." One would 
salute such openness on the part of the director if he also told 
us how long this money is supposed to last. If this is the 
annual budget, one can only sympathize with FCS staff: There 
will be only about R100,000 a month per each of them. 
  One should not judge the statute's authors harshly. First, 
because they had only two weeks--which included New Year 
celebrations--to draft it. And second, nobody in Russia so far 
had any knowledge as to how a civilized special service is 
supposed to function. 
  Therefore, the best thing to do is not rely on the statute's 
dry provisions but count on time, willy-nilly, making a real 
special service out of the former organs.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Baturin, national security adviser to the </F>
president of Russia: "The Special Service That 'Came In From the 
Cold'"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Mikhaylovich Baturin is a doctor of law. 
He was born in 1949 in Moscow. In 1973 he graduated from the 
airspace research department of the Physics and Technology 
Institute in Dolgoprudnoye. He worked in the Energiya 
Scientific-Industrial Association. Since 1980--in the State and 
Law Institute. He graduated by correspondence from the All-Union 
Juridical Institute and the Moscow University School of 
Journalism. The topic of his doctorate dissertation was computer 
law. In 1990 he went through internship in Washington, and since 
1991 worked on the staff of G. Shakhnazarov--M. Gorbachev's 
aide. Since 1992--in the Gorbachev Foundation. On 17 March 1993 
he was appointed a member of the Presidential Council, and in 
June of the same year--the Russian Federation president's 
adviser on legal issues. In January 1994 he was appointed the 
Russian Federation president's national security adviser. Since 
March 1994 he has also chaired the commission on supreme 
military positions, supreme military and supreme special ranks 
of the Personnel Policy Council. He has authored many works. He 
was one of the authors of the draft law on the mass media. 
  "In from the cold"--this term, not quite precisely 
translated after Le Carre's novel was published in 
Russian--today reflects rather precisely the true situation of 
Russian security organs. The structure that kept society 
fettered by cold fear and mutual suspicion, and then itself 
experienced harsh criticism bordering on revenge, is gradually 
thawing, acquiring a normal human face, and becoming capable of 
carrying out its real tasks. Russian citizens' natural interest 
in the topic of special services cannot be explained by vain, 
idle curiosity, or by the fact that the shroud of secrecy 
surrounding the activities of this kind of structure always 
arouses interest. And not only because reforms of our security 
services are frequently accompanied by disturbing details. To a 
large extent this interest is a logical trait of an emerging 
civil society. 
  A society coming out from under the state's control and 
intending in turn to control the latter has a vital stake in 
getting the maximum possible information on state structures 
whose activities to some or other degree affect human rights. 
Especially our, Russian, society. However, for well-known 
reasons heightened public sensitivity to the topic of special 
services is manifested in morbid forms. The pulling down of the 
Dzerzhinskiy monument in front of the KGB building in Moscow, as 
well as the demand to liquidate "competent organs," became the 
symbol of the public mood in recent times. 
  Today we see this as somewhat romantic, but also 
somewhat naive. Russia is gradually regaining its historical 
memory. The picture of the past is emerging increasingly fully 
and in more detail. Of course, we do not want to return to state 
arbitrariness, but we also reject other things--sedition, 
anarchy, in other words, "grass-roots arbitrariness." The 
reasons for the latter are known--a weak, impotent state. The 
symptoms of this dangerous disease manifested themselves 
graphically last year, and seriously alarmed most citizens. The 
Russian special services felt this change in the public mood, 
too. By now it is possible to formulate on the whole the social 
order Russia's nascent civil society placed with them: to 
effectively ensure the security of the country and its citizens, 
and to protect Russia's national interests, one of the central 
among which is the protection of democracy. 
  Last year, at a conference of high-ranking personnel of 
the central staff department of the Russian Ministry of Security 
[MB], President B. Yeltsin said that it puzzles him that there 
are legally existing organizations in the country that openly 
and publicly propagate ideas of seizing power and ethnic and 
social strife, form and train armed commando brigades, and 
openly operate as a mafia and control individual regions, while 
the MB is either unaware of this or not showing the proper 
initiative. Each of these questions is topical today. They 
represent a threat to our national security. Russian special 
services currently have the legal base to combat them. 
<H5>  In Search of Balance </H5>
  The Statute on the Federal Counterintelligence Service was 
recently published in the open press, and anybody may 
now read it. 
  The document directly defines the area of the service's 
responsibility. Among other things, it is tasked with 
identification, prevention, and suppression of intelligence and 
sabotage activities of foreign special services and 
organizations, as well as unlawful encroachment on the 
constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
defense capability of the Russian Federation. 
  This general definition is elaborated on in the form of a 
detailed list of tasks set for Russian counterintelligence. 
Among them: combating smuggling, corruption, international arms 
trading and drug trafficking, illegal armed formations, as well 
as illegally created or banned public associations encroaching 
on the constitutional system of the Russian Federation. 
  The Russian Federation president's message to the Federal 
Assembly outlined the priorities as we move toward a strong 
state capable of ensuring conditions for safe development of the 
individual and protecting him from criminal encroachment. Those 
who see the idea of a strong state as equivalent to state 
arbitrariness either are not being honest or simply are not 
aware of the vitally important needs of modern Russian society. 
For instance, the need to combat runaway organized crime aimed 
at seizing command positions in the state. 
  At the same time, boosting the FCS's effectiveness, as well 
as strengthening the state as a whole, today no longer may be 
based on the notorious "at any cost" principle. 
  While constantly lamenting the lack of a law-based state and 
neglect of legal norms, we clearly underestimate the processes 
of disintegration of totalitarian traditions in Russian society, 
which actually served as the main pillar of arbitrariness; 
moreover, they continuously reproduced the need for it. 
  During the memorable times of the Communist Party's 
political 
hegemony, the lack of detailed legislation regulating 
operational work was not considered a serious problem. State 
security officers were guided mainly by the orders of their 
superiors, and the latter--by the directives of party honchos 
(the consequences are well known). Currently the situation is 
already different. The very meaning of what is commonly called 
military discipline is changing. It no longer represents a lever 
one may use arbitrarily, outside of boundaries of the law. 
  Let us put it straight: The current legal base is far from 
perfect. What we have so far is only the foundations for 
regulating special services' activities. There are many 
unresolved issues. 
  In special services' practical activities, a collision 
frequently arises between political, operational expediency and 
prohibitions imposed by legal acts. Undoubtedly a contradiction 
between expediency and legality must be resolved in favor of the 
latter; however, neither should the latter be reduced to 
democratic slogans: It must ensure that we move along the road 
of long development of democratic society and remove the 
obstacles encountered along this road. 
  Russian legislation is oriented to a greater extent toward 
protection of citizens' rights than toward giving special 
services freedom of action. In principle, this is correct. 
However, shifting the center of gravity in the matter of 
ensuring the vitally important interests of the individual, 
society, and the state at the expense of the latter, without 
taking into account concrete realities in the life of our 
society, may in the final analysis jeopardize the security of 
the individual as well. 
  The priority for our lawmakers is to find the balance which 
would allow human rights to be guaranteed and at the same time 
ensure effectiveness of law enforcement organs' activities. 
There are problems in this respect that require their immediate 
attention. I will give just one small illustration. 
  The law on operational-investigative activities permits 
listening to telephone conversations only with respect to a 
specific person, regarding whom there is information 
that he is at the stage of preparation of an especially grave 
crime or has already committed one. But what does one do if such 
an individual has not yet been identified? 
  The simplest example are foreign special service stations, 
which operate, as high-ranking officials of foreign services 
contend, under the cover of embassies in Moscow. Naturally, 
foreign intelligence officers do not register themselves as 
such; they must be identified, and, given their skills, 
accomplishing this through regular methods is a hopeless 
undertaking. 
  It is a vicious circle: In order to identify a specific 
individual, who intends to commit a violation of the law, an 
operational-technical measure is needed. But in order to obtain 
permission to conduct such, it is necessary to have valid 
information that the specific person has violated the 
law. There are also other examples of the impossibility of 
effectively conducting a counterintelligence investigation among 
criminals. You may ask: Then how did counterintelligence act in 
these circumstances? It varied, depending on the point of view 
of the procurator who issued the sanction. 
  Since the new constitution has gone into effect, 
operational-technical measures involving individual rights are 
conducted on the basis of a court decision. Questions arise, 
however: In obtaining such a decision, is it permissible to 
present materials obtained as evidence for court consideration, 
as is done in many countries? Within the framework of which 
procedure? These questions, which define the specificity of 
special services' work, remain unanswered. 
  On the other hand, neither are legal departments of security 
organs very active in helping lawmakers find a way to resolve 
these problems. Those abroad, on the other hand, actively seek 
ways to influence Russia's leadership in the direction of 
"fundamental reform of Russian special services." For instance, 
the Heritage Foundation on commission from the U.S. Congress has 
drafted a document with recommendations of how to bring 
activities of Russian special services into line with Western 
standards. The document proposes modification of normative acts 
covering counterintelligence activities, specifically, for it to 
stop monitoring foreign citizens' travel inside the country and 
cut down on the use of covert sources of information. It also 
recommends urging the Russian leadership to publish as soon as 
possible drafts of new laws regarding special services' 
activities and their financing. 
  We, too, want clear legal regulation and civilized methods 
of 
special services' operations, but of course on a parity basis. 
For instance, a kind of gentlemen's agreements are reached 
between special services of some countries on methods that 
preclude violence. As to a common espionage 
practice--recruitment and use of agents, use of technical means 
for penetration and information-gathering, and so on--everything 
in this respect is the same as before. No agreements will remove 
the eternal problem of espionage. 
  In any case it is hard to imagine reaching such agreements 
with terrorist organizations, organized crime groups involved in 
illegal arms trading and drug trafficking, and illegal armed 
formations. 
  Thus, what our counterintelligence lacks is not a civilized 
demeanor, but rather aggressiveness, initiative, and 
concentration on the greatest threats to the state. The 
practice of years past, when, for instance, counterintelligence 
officers were sent to monitor compliance with trade regulations 
in stores and maintain order in the streets, and lately to 
inspect motor vehicles in search of contraband, should be 
completely eliminated. Special services are an expensive item 
for society, and therefore they must produce the maximum return. 
The task of counterintelligence is to select several targets 
that are commensurate with its great capabilities, and try to 
hit them. 
  Strictly speaking, some of the tasks included in the Statute 
on the Federal Counterintelligence Service are not really 
counterintelligence but rather belong in the sphere of domestic 
intelligence, and all of them are part of the sphere of state 
security. 
  One may argue to what extent the agency's name reflects the 
range of tasks it is charged with. Still, I think that this is 
not the main problem. The main issue is what place the FCS 
should take among special services in order to successfully 
carry out its functions. 
  The first thing one notices in reading the statute is a 
certain crossover of FCS authority and that of a number of other 
special services, as well as of law enforcement organs. There is 
a temptation to concentrate efforts, for instance, on 
suppression of corruption in one agency--for instance, the MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs]. But then by the same criterion 
the tax police should be merged into this ministry, although 
this is not done anywhere in the world. The simplicity of such 
solutions is deceptive, since the sphere of law enforcement 
needs a certain margin of safety. 
  The danger of duplicating activities between special 
structures may be overcome by increasing the degree of their 
coordination and, so to say, dividing spheres of interest. There 
are examples of this both in our practice and foreign practice. 
For instance, thanks to existing agreements no particular 
conflicts arise between services engaged in intelligence 
gathering (the FIS, the GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate], the 
FCS, and others). A good example is the U.S. FBI, which over the 
past few years has concentrated its efforts--thus making it 
different from other law enforcement organs--on penetrating the 
top organizational echelons of the drug mafia. 
  In addition, while considering the advantages of 
concentrating all special forces along selected directions, we 
also cannot dismiss another point of view presented by a number 
of responsible politicians, who emphasize the lack of a sensible 
balance of forces among organs of internal affairs and security. 
  Thus, in an organizational sense and in the matter of 
interaction with other agencies the FCS occupies its own 
specific niche in the system of special services. What remains 
is the issue of coordination, but this is achievable on the 
basis of the existing system of working liaison between agencies 
participating in this work. 
  In keeping with the FCS Statute, counterintelligence organs 
are subordinated directly to the head of state--the guarantor of 
the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and hence its 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Their 
independence from local authorities is quite justified by the 
specificity of the period our country is going through and gives 
it sufficient freedom of action for aggressive offense against 
corrupt groups and anticonstitutional manifestations. 
  Some corrections regarding counterintelligence could be made 
through the law on counterintelligence which is currently being 
drafted. In particular, it involves investigation of espionage 
cases. Counterintelligence needs a reliable, professionally 
trained investigative staff that specializes along these lines; 
this is a necessity, not a sign of the FCS's punitive functions. 
During the confirmation of the FCS Statute there were debates on 
this matter and, it is becoming clear, it has not been fully 
resolved. The idea of creating an investigative committee 
remains an idea, while skilled cadres capable of investigating 
complicated cases remain unutilized. Perhaps we should come back 
to this problem once again. Consider it, weigh all the pros and 
cons, and prepare proposals. 
  The organizational, legal, financial, and material-technical 
conditions being put in place for the FCS are only half of the 
matter. The main part is a trained corps of counterintelligence 
professionals, without whom it will not be possible to get the 
activities of this service going effectively, meeting the 
demands of modern Russian statehood. Certification of Russian 
counterintelligence cadres has been completed recently; it 
showed that the FCS has sufficient potential. Evidence of this, 
among other things, is the recent successes in disrupting the 
activities of German and British agents in Russia. Any 
counterintelligence operation requires a lengthy preparation 
stage; therefore, the latest of the publicly known successes of 
our counterintelligence are the result of the painstaking 
activities that preceded them. 
  Whether there are many such successes or not is another 
matter. The times when an NKVD [People's Commissariat for 
Internal Affairs] oblast administration received a quota for 
catching a certain number of Australian, Mexican, Thai, or other 
spies--which was always met and exceeded--are past. But if we 
compare the current effectiveness of counterintelligence work in 
Russia and, for instance, the United States, the achievements 
are roughly comparable. With respect to other lines of work, 
however, Russian counterintelligence still has a long way to go. 
<H5>  "Feel the Difference" </H5>
  Almost none of those who support the creation of a law-based 
state argue, for instance, the need for a democratic state to 
have such a special service as foreign intelligence. No wonder. 
Intelligence organs as a rule do not work against their own 
citizens--their activities are aimed outside, and this situation 
almost everywhere is codified in the law. 
  This means that when the interests of the state do not 
conflict sharply with the interests of its citizens, as is the 
case with intelligence, the problem of special services 
violating rights and freedoms does not look all that topical. 
The main heat of criticism is reserved for domestic intelligence 
used in combating terrorism, organized crime, etc., as well as 
counterintelligence. But while the former, which is frequently 
associated with political surveillance, is simply rejected as an 
instrument of a totalitarian state, counterintelligence 
seemingly is permitted to exist but under a constant fire of 
criticism from all sides: from the authorities--for being 
passive in uncovering and preventing internal threats against 
the state; and from the public--for attempts to expand its 
sphere of functions. 
  Against this background the public is offered time and again 
novel but rather lightweight reasoning on the ways to 
reorganize Russia's security organs. In it, the 
authors usually work mainly from two premises: the need to 
remove the threat to democracy presented by the heirs of 
"competent organs" and foreign experience of building a special 
service. 
  Let us leave aside at this point deliberate attempts to 
mislead the public. The reason the authors of reform schemes do 
not understand the substance of the issue, in my opinion, is 
that they apparently incorrectly formulate their goal. After 
all, if the goal is to remove a potential threat presented by 
special services, the easiest way to achieve it is to liquidate 
them. In other words, the best cure for a headache is the 
guillotine. 
  If, however, the task is to create a democratic state that 
possesses all means of maintaining its stability, the solution 
should be sought in the balance of strength and efficiency of 
special organs and the ability to keep them under control. 
  In this, it would be wrong to disregard extensive foreign 
experience--without, of course, succumbing to the other extreme 
of automatically copying other models without consideration for 
the important special features of Russian reality. 
  Since there is an opinion that MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS 
forecasts usually come true, let us take as an example 
information received by the newspaper from a "reliable" source 
about potential disbandment of the FCS and the transfer of its 
component administrations to various ministries and agencies. 
(Actually, this version was mentioned in other publications as 
well.) 
  The economic counterintelligence administration allegedly 
will go to the Ministry of the Economy. The counterintelligence 
operations administration will find its rightful place in the 
Ministry of Justice and will become something like a Russian 
FBI. Everything almost like in the United States. But that is 
the point--almost. 
  It would be appropriate to recall that many ministries which 
have similar or even identical names here and abroad carry out 
different functions. For instance, the U.S. Department of the 
Interior deals with land development, management of natural 
resources, and is in charge of natural preserves. The American 
Department of Justice is more like the Russian general 
procuracy. It is responsible first and foremost for monitoring 
compliance with federal laws, represents federal organizations 
in civil litigation, and acts as a prosecutor when violations of 
the law are committed. By the way, the head of this organization 
is at the same time, using our terminology, the general 
procurator of the United States of America. "Feel the 
difference," as the famous commercial tells us. 
  Besides, the FBI, strictly speaking, is not so much 
counterintelligence, which is the task of only one of the 
bureau's many services, as it is a special combination of a 
special service and a law enforcement organ. Along with 
counterespionage, the FBI's tasks include: combating bank 
robberies, aircraft hijacking, bribery, and corruption; 
kidnapping investigations; and other functions. Thus, 
implementing the project "Let Us Do As They Do in the West" may 
lead to the situation described in a fairy tale, where the genie 
Khottabych made a precious-metal telephone apparatus. It looks 
like a real one, but you cannot make a call on it. 
  This is the kind of "counterintelligence apparatus" we may 
get under this version. In order to avoid this we would have to 
make dramatic modifications to the functions of the Ministry of 
Justice, special services, and law enforcement organs. But this 
is already reorganization on a much greater scale, which will 
demand an all-out reshaping of the structure of executive 
authority. When are we to work then? And how much will such a 
"reorganization"--performed for the sole purpose of bringing it 
more or less closer to the American original--cost the taxpayer? 
Continuing the polemics with such a proposal, it would make 
sense to ask one more, most important, question: Will such a 
structure work effectively in our conditions? 
  An example of a more or less successful reorganization of 
security organs along Western models is the separation of the 
Foreign Intelligence Service into an independent agency. The 
relatively low cost of this undertaking (and there is cost 
attached to everything) is the result first and foremost of the 
fact that its predecessor--the First Chief Directorate--had 
quite considerable autonomy even when it was part of the KGB. 
The Border Troops were split into a separate service without any 
particular complications for the same reason. However, such a 
straightforward "improvement" of counterintelligence is 
impermissible. 
  First, even within one counterintelligence 
service, coordination of activities against diverse foreign 
services aiming at different objects and persons in Russia 
already represents a rather complex problem, which even now is 
being handled with difficulty. 
  What will happen then if counterintelligence were broken up 
into independent agencies responsible for individual foreign 
services or objects or, even worse, both attributes at the same 
time? A complex and very expensive setup for control and 
coordination of all domestic special services will be 
required--something like a Ministry of Coordination. 
  Second, in additional to actual operational units, 
counterintelligence has support units--such as technical support 
for operations--which in their current state simply cannot be 
divided. This means that additional money will be needed to 
create their own, "pocket" technical services, or the 
aforementioned units will have to be given the status of 
interagency bodies, with the resulting need for an additional 
bureaucratic structure. 
  The situation is the same with respect to reference records 
and information funds, dividing which and subsequently working 
with them presents an awesome problem. 
  Third, what do we do about local 
counterintelligence organs in republics, krays, and oblasts? 
Divide them by offices-"departments"? 
  In principle, we could experiment, using any model of 
building a system of national security organs--German, American, 
French, or some other. But this is a costly undertaking for our 
current situation, with the Ministry of Finance trying to save 
every ruble. It is even more impermissible in the atmosphere of 
political instability, where each imprudent move causes 
thunderous reverberations. 
  Reforming the special services is normal practice even in 
the 
life of states where democracy is an established practice and 
problems of distribution of authority have been resolved. But 
nowhere in the world will we find reorganization for the sake of 
reorganization. 
  New geopolitical realities and the emergence of new threats 
after the end of the "cold war"--all this requires from any 
state greater attention to special structures. 
  Reorientation of special services is quite natural. The 
organizational capabilities, technical equipment, and financial 
resources of criminal organizations in a number of instances are 
on par with those of the intelligence services of some 
countries. For instance, the income of South American drug 
cartels is comparable to the budget of the U.S. CIA. One can 
hardly hope to successfully uncover and disrupt extremely secret 
activities of criminal groups without using special methods and 
means. 
  One can hardly find a country these days where the tasks of 
special services, as well as organizational methods of carrying 
them out, are not being revised to some or other extent. 
  Our country is no exception in this respect. It has tried a 
great variety of forms--from the VChK [All-Russian Special 
Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Sabotage, and 
Speculation], OGPU [United State Political Directorate], NKVD, 
NKGB [People's Commissariat for State Security], MGB [Ministry 
of State Security], and KGB to MSB [motorized-rifle battalion], 
AFB [Agency for Federal Security], MBVD [Ministry of Security 
and Internal Affairs], MB [Ministry of Security], and finally 
FCS. There have also been attempts to merge the special services 
with neighbor organizations. For instance, an Information 
Committee under the USSR MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] was 
created and functioned, and even had its own intelligence 
school. One can only be amazed at the variety of forms. It seems 
that only the word "bureau" (if we leave aside the Komintern 
[Communist International] intelligence service) has not been 
used in the names of domestic security organs. It is a rare 
ministry or agency that can boast a history so replete with 
numerous transformations. 
  It is expected that we learn lessons from the past. One of 
them is that any reform, in addition to planned positive 
results, inevitably produces negative ones as well. First of 
all, with respect to cadres. A special service is not just 
buildings, equipment, and methods of operation--it is first and 
foremost professionals. If they leave, succession is 
broken; the ability to self-reproduce is lost, which is 
absolutely counterproductive for a self-contained organization, 
which special services always are. 
  One must also mention persons who assist security organs, 
including on a covert basis. Successful use of a covert agent 
network, without which special services' operations are 
impossible, is predicated first and foremost on public awareness 
of the tremendous role of these specific state structures, which 
they play in protecting the civil society. 
  Let us draw some conclusions. For instance, how delicate is 
the sphere of national security, which to a considerable extent 
is linked with the general problem of distribution of authority 
in a state. That society's expectations, its reserve of 
patience, have reached the limit, and we cannot make any more 
mistakes. That each reorganization is another trial for 
professionals, and that an organizational failure, which 
practically undermines the authority of counterintelligence, is 
the worst propaganda anyone could conceive. 
  Thus, we can hardly qualify as an informational or 
analytical 
breakthrough of some mass media the fact that they regularly 
spin out a version of another reorganization of the FCS. 
  Let us emphasize that standards for special services' work 
are set not on the basis of theoretical models and foreign 
analogies, but are based on the existing state system and the 
tasks the state is dealing with at any particular moment in 
history. How and with what resources counterintelligence organs 
will be handling the task of ensuring national security, and 
what changes are necessary in the FCS structure must be defined, 
among other things, also at the initiative and with the direct 
participation of the counterintelligence service itself. 
  On the whole, however, it may be said that the task of 
reorganization has been solved by the Russian 
Federation President's Edict No. 19 of 5 January 1994, which 
approved the Statute on the Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
These documents protect Russian special services from "cavalry 
attacks," from destructive temptations--wherever they may come 
from. It may be a paradox, but they complete the succession of 
continuous transformations of special services that has long 
acquired the attribute of ill-conceived perpetuality. The 
meaning of these decisions is to protect the structure necessary 
for society and the state from emotional, incompetent, faddish 
changes; to create conditions not for future reorganizations but 
for normal work of the Federal Counterintelligence Service in 
the new situation. 
<H5>  Access to Special Kitchen? </H5>
  It is obvious that a strong state needs strong special 
services. For a country that wants to strengthen the state 
foundation, the might of the special services must be 
commensurate with the obstacles that will have to be overcome 
along this road. However, in order for special services 
themselves not to become such an obstacle, their activities must 
be subject to strict state and public oversight. The creation of 
such oversight is a problem for any state, since it inevitably 
conflicts with such an attribute of any special service as 
secrecy. 
  We know, for instance, of a recent incident involving Lady 
N., head of the British MI-5 counterintelligence service, whom 
the press "tracked down" after her name was made public. In 
their evaluation, it would present no difficulty for numerous 
terrorist groups in the country to organize a kidnapping of 
Great Britain's counterintelligence chief from her home. This 
scandalous incident is another argument in favor of those who 
insist on preserving the British tradition of complete secrecy 
when it comes to special services and their personnel. 
  British law sets very strict limitations on public access to 
the special services' "kitchen." For instance, it is considered 
a crime for any staff member (including former) to make public 
any information about his organization. Even committed by a 
regular civil servant, disclosure of information on special 
services may fall under a criminal statute. There is also 
liability for disclosing information concerning the activities 
of intelligence and counterintelligence organs if such a 
disclosure is made abroad. If we had such laws, perhaps this 
article could not be published. 
  Nevertheless, the British taxpayer is not deprived of the 
ability to find out through parliament what his money is spent 
on in the case of special services. Let us note, however, that 
Westminster is in no hurry to introduce broad parliamentary 
oversight of special services and relies on a very small circle 
of persons who have access to the shrine, first and foremost the 
prime minister, who is personally responsible for the 
organization of activities and oversight of special organs. 
  We should not blindly copy any democratic experience, but it 
makes sense to study it. Especially considering that we do not 
have our own traditions in this sphere. Therefore I 
would like to warn those who advocate comprehensive deputy 
oversight: A special service that is under open oversight is 
finished. In this respect, our lawmakers must accomplish 
extremely delicate work in creating and fine-tuning an 
appropriate oversight mechanism, and certainly do so in 
interaction with the judiciary and executive authorities. 
  Within the boundaries of his authority, the president of the 
Russian Federation not only organizes the activities of main 
Russian special services, including the FCS, but also conducts 
oversight, and is responsible for them before society and the 
state. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Special services per se are not a threat to democracy and 
society. The threat stems from the desire to subordinate their 
activities to any one political force or, worse, political or 
nationalistic clan or group. In order to keep this from 
happening in Russia, each branch of authority should provide in 
an appropriate form a legal base for the activities of 
intelligence and counterintelligence structures. However, these 
structures, too--and first and foremost the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service that "came in from the cold"--will 
have to make a tremendous effort as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuznetsov, former inspectorate chief of </F>
the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety 
Central District, with introduction by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA 
special correspondent Kirill Belyaninov, published under the 
heading "Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl": "Nuclear Power 
Industry Through the Eyes of An Unemployed Nuclear Oversight 
Inspector"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  A Peaceful Atom For Every Home: Alas, This We Have Already </H5>
Achieved 
  I am sick and tired of it all. Of endless competition in the 
speed of printing documents fabricated by one political group in 
order to destroy another; of careful calculation of the arc of 
fire at the headquarters of hostile political groupings and 
pocket-size parties; the national pastime of watching the state 
of the liver of the also nationally elected president and of 
bringing in astrologers to tell us the dates and details of 
future coups. In the endless flak of arguments about how to 
conduct another revolution, we have somehow forgotten that there 
are far more real problems. 
  We have forgotten that in the Far East "friends and business 
partners" from North and South Korea will soon leave 
nothing--not even stumps--in centuries-old taiga; that 150 
companies from America and West Europe are flooding the country 
with toxic waste in exchange for Russian metal; and that, 
finally, because of our own negligence and indifference the 
threat of a new Chernobyl has become far more real than the 
threat of a coup. 
  I am sick and tired of it, because dozens of LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA materials--and we wrote about it all: the "black market" 
in nuclear materials, the Western radioactive waste coming into 
our country, the catastrophic situation in the domestic nuclear 
power generation--did not elicit any response from our own 
government circles, which are busier attempting to reposition 
themselves in the shadow of the ruling chair. 
  I am sick and tired of it because the almost two-year-long 
struggle of Vladimir Kuznetsov, former Gosatomnadzor [Russian 
Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] inspector, 
fired for his attempt to shut down 10 unsafe nuclear reactors, 
has not produced any results. Among the people he appealed to 
are the first persons in the Russian "ecological" establishment: 
presidential adviser A. Yablokov; Social-Ecological Union 
Chairman S. Zabelin... None of them supported Kuznetsov, while 
the truly horrible information he collected is still gathering 
dust in the safes of highest-level offices. 
  You need facts? There are many of them in the article V. 
Kuznetsov brought to the newspaper. Judge for yourself whether 
coup rumors are more important than something that affects our 
life. 
<H5>  Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl </H5>
  Last year I had an honor my "colleagues" in the line at the 
employment agency could only dream about. Can you imagine an 
unemployed American being is invited as a consultant to the U.S. 
Senate, let alone the White House? Nevertheless, anything can 
happen in Russia, and an officially registered unemployed 
Russian may work for an equally official presidential adviser. 
There are numerous advantages to this method: If the finished 
report attracts the "highest attention," there is no need to 
introduce the author, who has not gained any status in the 
nomenklatura; in the event of failure, however, one may resort 
to a tried and tested remark: "Well, you know, we have to use 
the services of questionable characters, but after all, we do 
not get any support from ministries and agencies...." 
  This in itself would not be too bad--one can swallow 
personal 
insult if the information you collected literally crumb by crumb 
did indeed bring about at least some result. But time goes on, 
and nothing changes. Presidential advisers shove the material 
you prepared to the back of the desk drawer; ecological 
organizations of the Social-Ecological Union and Physicians of 
the World for Prevention of Nuclear War type shrug their 
shoulders helplessly; and ministerial bureaucrats simply dismiss 
the facts and figures they are shown. 
  It is easy to understand the reason for such attitudes. All 
the reports and memoranda are devoted to the activities of only 
one, albeit very impressive agency--the Russian Minatom 
[Ministry of Atomic Energy], which has always held the status of 
"sacred cow" in domestic industry. Nevertheless, let us try to 
sort out what is hidden behind the polished sign of the 
omnipotent ministry. 
  Radioactive waste disposal is perhaps one of the items at 
the 
top of the list of Russian ecological problems. 
  Existing capacities simply are insufficient, and the size 
and 
safety of storage facilities are limited, while construction of 
new ones involves immense expenditures of technical and monetary 
resources. At the same time, existing plans for dismantling 
nuclear arms and nuclear power generation systems far from 
always comply with the ability to safely store the resulting 
radioactive waste. At the end of 1992 the total area of 
contaminated land amounted to 52,263 hectares. Of them, 16 were 
recultivated over the year. According to official data of the 
Ministry of the Ecology alone, Russian Minatom enterprises have 
accumulated radioactive waste with a total emission power of 1.7 
billion curies, which are kept in 227 storage facilities, and of 
these, 81 have already been sealed. 
  If only the problem were limited to the number of storage 
facilities, though! At some enterprises the waste is kept in the 
open; most solid radioactive waste disposal sites do not meet 
elementary safety standards. And the system of handling solid 
radioactive waste in our country not only does not meet IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] standards but is contrary 
to the practice of developed countries. 
  The problems of enterprises whose names have been mentioned 
in the world press for many years--Mayak Production Association 
(Chelyabinsk-65) and Siberian Chemical Combine (Tomsk-7)--still 
have not been resolved. 
  In 1992 the maximum allowable discharge of strontium-90 at 
Mayak was exceeded by a factor of 1.8. The waste was dumped into 
the Techa river. At the same time, at the Siberian Chemical 
Combine norms of discharge of phosphorus-32 were exceeded by a 
factor of 1.14. The average annual concentration of this 
radionuclide in the Tom river was 2.9 times higher than the 
allowable level. 
  In 1993 serious accidents involving radiation occurred at 
both enterprises. Serious and very representative commissions 
visited the sites; tonnes of papers were written, but no 
particular conclusions were drawn from the events. Suffice it to 
mention that the already approved program of replacing equipment 
presenting nuclear danger at these enterprises is still not 
being implemented. 
  This, however, is just a concrete case involving only two 
nuclear facilities. Of much greater interest is something else: 
In February of this year the Russian Gosatomnadzor, known in the 
past for the extreme caution of its statements, suddenly 
subjected the state of the Russian nuclear complex to sharp 
criticism. Inspection of practically all domestic nuclear 
installations showed that "the state of nuclear and radiation 
safety in the Russian Federation as a whole cannot be called 
satisfactory. Numerous problems associated with the use of 
nuclear energy are being resolved extremely slowly and are not 
regulated by law..." 
  After such a serious statement, however, which for the first 
time indicated a split between Minatom and Gosatomnadzor, 
information came out which at first glance completely refuted 
the Federal Oversight's conclusions. The Rosenergoatom concern's 
vice president, B. Antonov, representing the main user 
organization, said that on the contrary, the safety of Russian 
AES's [nuclear power stations] has increased: There were 45 
fewer incidents at stations in 1993 than in 1992. 
  For a specialist this is a strange argument, to say the 
least. The decline in the number of incidents is not at all an 
indicator of AES safety. Last year a considerable number of 
AES's were operating at reduced capacity. This happened because 
of the considerably greater length of the repair season at power 
generators of all stations: electric power consumers simply did 
not pay their bills on time, and the AES's did not have the 
money to buy materials and component parts in the needed 
quantities. 
  In addition, controller-imposed restrictions on capacities 
(up to 23.9 percent, plus the restrictions introduced by the 
Federal Oversight--26.1 percent of the rated level) together 
produce a figure equal to a 50 percent loss in power generation 
output. The figures above confirm not only the thesis of 
Rosenergoatom's imperfect--to put it mildly--calculations and 
the resulting conclusion regarding the increased safety of the 
AES's, but also bring up a no less important question: Can it be 
that electric power produced by AES's at the old level of output 
is not needed by the Russian economy, which constantly complains 
about energy shortages? And what has caused these restrictions 
if, in the opinion of Minatom bureaucrats, everything is going 
so well in their industry? 
  Somehow, the No. 2 and No. 3 generators at the Balakovo 
station and the No. 5 Generator at the Novovoronezh station, 
which had been under long-term repair, as well as Balakovo's No. 
4 generator, which was recently brought on line, have 
disappeared from the list of AES's to be inspected. According to 
the results of last year, it was these stations' power 
generators, as well as those at the Kola AES, that were found to 
be the worst in terms of reliability and stability of operation. 
  In June 1993 a "medium-gravity incident" was registered at 
the No. 2 generator at the Balakovo AES--jamming of 11 
regulation devices in the control and protection system; at the 
Novovoronezh AES No. 5 generator in February last year there was 
an incident classified as "insignificant:" the water-chemical 
condition was off balance. At the Kola AES the incident was far 
more serious: As a result of a hurricane, high-voltage lines in 
the Kolenergo system were damaged, which resulted in the 
shutdown of all four of the stations' power generators. 
  As to work on increasing AES safety, this is not even on the 
agenda at this point. Actions in replacing technical channels at 
RBMK [high-power pressurized tube reactor] power generators and 
steam generators at power generators with VVER [water-moderated 
power reactor] reactors do not increase safety as compared to 
the design level--they only remove design faults discovered in 
the process of exploitation. Technical substantiation of safety 
factors at most power generators is still at the stage of 
development; there is no systematic substantiation of planned 
measures with respect to power generators' technical 
retrofitting and modernization. As to exploitation of all 
nuclear reactors and systems without exception, it is still 
being conducted in accordance with safety norms developed at the 
time they were built--that is, 15-20 years ago--and today does 
not even come close to modern standards. As to Minatom's 
contention that an IAEA commission that visited most AES's 
appraised their safety condition as satisfactory, this is no 
guarantee. The conclusions of various IAEA commissions are of a 
purely advisory nature and are not mandatory for compliance. 
  Nothing has changed since then, and our power generation 
industry is still ruled by the kilowatt-hour, not by safety. 
  Speaking of research nuclear installations, the situation 
with respect to them is even more difficult than that with 
nuclear reactors. The reason is not only the extreme 
obsolescence and physical wear and tear of the equipment and 
technological systems, but also the absence of practically any 
norms and safety systems. There is no normative-technical 
documentation; there is no statewide program of utilization of 
research systems, which would allow a definition of the 
necessary volume of work on these systems; there is no system 
for localizing accidents, and no simulator facility for 
personnel training. 
  The situation with respect to spent nuclear fuel at 
scientific research centers that use nuclear reactors is 
critical. In the NII [scientific research institute] of Atomic 
Reactors in Ulyanovsk Oblast, in the Physics and Energy 
Institute in Kaluga Oblast, and in the Kurchatov Institute in 
Moscow, facilities for storage of spent nuclear fuel are filled 
to 80-90 percent of capacity, while the technology for 
reprocessing it simply does not exist. 
  The practice of liquid radioactive waste disposal in the NII 
of Atomic Reactors simply does not have any analogues. Medium- 
and low-activity waste in Ulyanovsk Oblast is simply pumped 
underground into so-called "absorbing collector beds." As a 
result, more than 2 million cubic meters of waste with a total 
activity of 100,000 curies have already accumulated in 
underground storage. By law, however, waste disposal can be done 
only after it is "converted into solid explosion-, fire- and 
nuclear-proof form." In other words, waste must be converted 
into a form that ensures its reliable isolation in a geological 
medium. 
  Fifty years of operations of the Russian scientific center 
Kurchatov Institute produced an extremely difficult problem 
associated with rehabilitation of land set aside for temporary 
storage, and taking off line obsolete research systems. At the 
territory of the institute, which is located in the heart of the 
city of 9 million inhabitants, temporary storage--which, by the 
way, has remained "temporary" since the time it was built in the 
1940's--occupies an area of two hectares. It is estimated that 
it contains more than 200 tonnes of highly radioactive waste. 
  Normative documents, which have been at the development 
stage 
since 1989--nuclear safety rules for research reactors and many 
others--will not come out any time soon. The explanation is 
simple: The Kurchatov Institute is the leading scientific 
organization with respect to almost all Russian research 
reactors, and it is apparently not in its interests to introduce 
stricter safety regulations. This will require considerable 
financial investment and bringing the system to the required 
level or shutting it down. 
  The shortcoming and problems I have enumerated involve the 
activities of only one agency--the Russian Ministry of Atomic 
Energy, as well as of the structures it has set up. But even in 
the new political environment the methods Minatom utilizes for 
solving its problems remain the same old ones. As in the past, 
the atomic industry is trying to "twist the government's arm." 
Otherwise how can one explain the clamor recently raised by this 
agency in the press? (A good dozen newspapers published the 
outcry that nuclear stations are running out of fuel during the 
peak period of fall-winter demand, and soon nearly half of 
Russia will be without heat and light unless a number of 
decisive steps are immediately taken.) But the answer to this 
question is not that complicated: Having bungled things up once 
again, Minister V. Mikhaylov is trying to cover it up by 
grabbing a juicier chunk of state subsidies. It is no secret to 
anyone that both enterprises producing nuclear fuel and nuclear 
power stations are under the roof of one and the same agency, 
and therefore what we have is obviously an elementary 
miscalculation. Neither does Minatom's panicky tone fit with the 
recently signed agreement to sell nuclear fuel to the United 
States. If we cannot provide for ourselves, how can we talk 
about selling it to other countries? 
  Nothing will change unless in the nearest future a package 
of 
legislative acts is adopted on the use of nuclear power 
generation, and a state safety program is drafted and backed up 
by priority financing. 
  Without this first step, nothing will change. And who knows, 
perhaps in just another 10 years Russia will turn into a huge 
Chernobyl zone.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Lagovskiy: "The Close Circle of the </F>
Unified Energy System"] 
  [Text] Soon enterprises that have "forgotten" to pay for 
electricity could possibly be reminded of their debts by having 
their electricity cut off. At least such a harsh suggestion was 
heard at the regular conference of the first deputy chairman of 
the Government of Russia, Oleg Soskovets. The measure is highly 
favored by economic managers since it sometimes enables them to 
solve operational problems. At this one they were considering 
various ways of stabilizing the financial situation of nuclear 
power plants and enterprises of the nuclear fuel cycle. 
  The situation is such that nuclear power plants may be 
transformed quickly and easily from energy producers to energy 
consumers. Many of the plants are threatening to shut down. 
  Representatives of nuclear power plants state that they have 
no money for fuel because the Russian Joint-Stock Company 
Unified Energy System Rossiya owes them 450 billion rubles [R]. 
The latter, in turn, does not consider itself to blame--the 
direct consumers of energy owe it even more. 
  The government has promised credit in the amount of R50 
billion to settle the accounts of the nuclear power plants. But 
that will apparently not solve the basic problem. The money will 
be spent on plugging up holes, and after a month or two the 
situation will return to its original impasse. Therefore, in the 
opinion of the majority of those present, it is necessary to 
change the system: to create a market for electric energy. It 
must be sold and not "released." 
  The conference earmarked a number of immediate measures 
which 
could possibly help to emerge from the crisis. Among them are 
deferring payments on taxes to the republic budget and granting 
nuclear power plants the right to conclude direct agreements for 
the delivery of electric energy to regional consumers. 
  There was an amusing side to this. A representative of one 
of 
the nuclear power plants who was among those picketing the White 
House was interested to hear a proposal from the Ministry of 
Nuclear Energy to find additional funds by reducing the wages of 
the workers at the plants. He said something to the effect that 
for the sake of the country's safety he could take such a 
measure if he received his "gigantic" wage of 200,000 every 
month. But for now he cannot, since the last time he was paid 
was in February.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Novikov: "ZIL Did Not Get Far on the </F>
Wheels of Privatization"] 
  [Text] The beginning of this year was marked by a 
severe crisis in Russian machine-building. Productions at GAZ 
[Gorkiy Automotive Plant], Rosselmash, and AZLK [Automotive 
Plant imeni Leninskiy Komsomol] were shut down or switched to a 
partial work week. Yesterday there was a conference of the labor 
collective at the enterprise, in which FITUR [Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia] Chairman M. Shakov 
participated. ZIL general director Ye. Brakov briefed the worker 
association on the situation at the plant. 
  In his words, ZIL operated relatively stably during 
1992-1993. During this time it produced 373 billion rubles' [R] 
worth of products. And the net profit remaining with the 
enterprise amounted to R38 billion. But today the plant has 
encountered the problem of selling its products. Mainly because 
of the inability to pay on the part of the traditional motor 
vehicle consumers--the army, agriculture, industrial enterprises. 
  Moreover, the enterprise, like, incidentally, all 
law-abiding 
domestic taxpayers, is gasping under the pressure of taxes. In 
spite of the fact that ZIL is maintaining all of its facilities 
of the social sphere at its own expense, the enterprise has to 
make considerable deductions into the state budget and nonbudget 
funds for social development. 
  As a result, ZIL first switched to a four-day work week and 
soon after that production had to be halted. In Ye. Brakov's 
words, for this year the enterprise concluded agreements for the 
delivery of 159,000 motor vehicles. But according to the 
estimates of experts, it will manage to sell only 55,000. 
Because of the sharp drop in demand and the reduction of 
production, the number of workers at the enterprise decreased 
this year from 92,000 to 84,000. Wages average only R90,000. 
Apparently the deterioration of the situation at ZIL threatens 
to be catastrophic. 
  In the opinion of the leaders of the enterprise, the state, 
which owns 20 percent of the ZIL shares, should help the plant. 
ZIL specialists have calculated that R30 billion would save the 
plant today. And ZIL would be able to repay this credit and 
settle some of its debts, which have already reached R115 
billion. Moreover, it would seem that the state should settle 
first of all with those who purchase products from ZIL. 
Obviously, the plant would not then start holding out its hand 
for regular aid.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report "The Great Lukoil Initiative"] </F>
  [Text] The largest company in Russia is freezing 
prices of petroleum and petroleum products. 
  This sensational announcement was made on Monday at a 
news conference of the Lukoil Petroleum company by its vice 
president, Leonid Fedun: The company's leaders have decided to 
freeze prices of the petroleum and petroleum products it 
produces during the second quarter of 1994 at the level of 
prices of the first quarter. 
  "This is a purely economic step," emphasized L. Fedun. "As 
calculations show, Russia's current overproduction of petroleum 
and petroleum products amounts to 25-30 percent of the overall 
volume. At the same time the potential capacity of the petroleum 
complex exceeds the overall demand of the country's enterprises 
1.5- to twofold. Taking into account the constant reduction of 
the effective demand, the real demand for petroleum and 
petroleum products amounts to about 60 percent of production and 
has a tendency toward further decline. 
  Under these conditions raising the price of oil is 
economically inexpedient. The only effective means of preventing 
a fatal development of events is for the country's largest 
producers to maintain the existing price level for their 
products.

Ukraine and generally recognized principles of international 
procedure in the sphere of information, this Law governs the 
social relations connected with the designation of information 
as state secrets, its classification and its safeguarding with 
the aim of protecting the vitally important interests of Ukraine 
in the sphere of defense, economics, foreign relations, state 
security and the safeguarding of law and order.

state secret under the procedure stipulated by this Law, and is 
subject to safeguarding on the part of the state. 
  The degree of secrecy is a category that describes the 
importance of that information, the possible damage as a 
consequence of divulging it, the degree of restriction of access 
to it and the level of its safeguarding by the state. The 
criteria for the designation of the degree of secrecy of 
information are established by the State Committee of Ukraine on 
Issues of State Secrets. 
  Article 2. The legislation of Ukraine on state 
secrets 
  The legislation of Ukraine on state secrets is based on the 
Law of Ukraine "Information," and is composed of this Law and 
other acts of legislation of Ukraine adopted in accordance with 
it. 
  The force of the legislation of Ukraine on state secrets 
does 
not extend to relations associated with the safeguarding of 
commercial or banking secrets or other confidential or secret 
information, if the latter is not simultaneously also a state 
secret. 
  Article 3. State policy with regard to state 
secrets 
  State policy with regard to state secrets, as a constituent

secrets, including the establishment of a special regimen for 
the use and disposal of information that is designated a state 
secret and its media, are designated in accordance with this Law 
by agreement between the owner of the information or its media 
and the State Committee of Ukraine on Issues of State Secrets. 
  If the restrictions on the right of ownership of information 
that is regarded as a state secret and its media as designated 
in an agreement cause harm to their owner, then that harm is 
compensated to the owner in full, including income not received 
because of the state. 
  If the owner of information that is designated as a state 
secret or its media refuse to reach an agreement on the 
safeguarding of state secrets or violate it, that information or 
its media may be taken under the ownership of the state by 
decision of a court. The procedure and amounts of compensation 
for such a taking are defined by the Cabinet of Ministers of 
Ukraine. 
  Article 5. Financing of measures to designate 
information as state secrets and its classification and 
safeguarding 
  The measures to designate information as state secrets and 
its classification and safeguarding are financed through the 
state budget, the budgets of bodies of local and regional 
self-government, and the funds of enterprises, institutions and 
organizations that carry out activities connected with state 
secrets. 
  Measures with regard to the designation of information as 
state secrets, its classification and safeguarding at 
enterprises with non-state forms of ownership are financed on 
the basis of an agreement with the customer enterprise for the 
performance of the operations associated with state secrets.

seal to the corresponding document, item or other physical 
medium of the information. 
  The secrecy seal is a mandatory requisite of each physical 
medium of information that has been designated a state secret. 
It must contain information on the degree of secrecy of the 
information ("particular importance," "top secret" or "secret"), 
the time period of the classification and the official who 
affixed the indicated seal. 
  If a secrecy seal cannot be affixed directly to the medium 
of 
the information, it may be affixed to the accompanying documents. 
  The affixing of the secrecy seals stipulated by this Law to 
the media of other secret or confidential information that is 
not a state secret is prohibited.

seal to information media is approved by the head of the

activity connected with state secrets. 
  After the conclusion of the stipulated time periods for the

Law. It may not exceed 30 years for information of "particular 
importance," 10 years for information that is "top secret" and 
five years for information that is "secret." 
  The term of classification begins at the moment the secrecy 
seal is affixed to the corresponding information medium. 
  The President of Ukraine, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
Ukraine or the Prime Minister of Ukraine may extend the term of 
classification of information, either on their own initiative or 
on the basis of a decision by other state experts on issues of 
secrecy. 
  Article 15. Appeal of the unwarranted 
classification of information 
  Citizens and legal persons have the right to submit to 
officials who have affixed a secrecy seal to information media a 
well-founded proposal for the declassification of information, 
which is mandatory for consideration. The indicated officials 
shall provide a written response to the citizen or legal person 
on this score within a month. 
  A decision to declassify information may be appealed to an 
official of a higher level to whom the official who affixed the 
secrecy seal to the corresponding information bearer is 
subordinate. In the event of a failure to satisfy the complaint, 
the citizen or legal person has the right to appeal the unlawful 
actions of officials to a court. 
<H5>  Part IV </H5>

information that constitutes state secrets and their safekeeping 
  Uniform requirements with regard to the manufacture, 
utilization, assurance of good physical condition, transporting 
and accounting for the media of information that constitutes 
state secrets, as well as their safekeeping, are established by 
the State Committee of Ukraine on Issues of State Secrets. 
  Article 19. Licensing of enterprises, institutions 
and organizations that perform activity connected with state 
secrets 
  The granting of the right to perform activity connected with 
state secrets to enterprises, institutions and organizations is 
accomplished by means of the drawing up of the corresponding 
permission (license) by the State Committee of Ukraine on Issues 
of State Secrets. 
  The procedure and terms for granting the indicated 
permission 
(license) are defined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  The enterprises, institutions and organizations to which the 
permission (license) indicated in this article is granted gain 
the right of access to specific information that constitutes 
state secrets in accordance with the directive of state bodies 
authorized to do so by a finding of a state expert on issues of 
state secrets. The transfer of information that constitutes 
state secrets or their media to other enterprises, institutions 
and organizations that have the corresponding permission 
(secrecy regimen) of the State Committee of Ukraine on Issues of 
State Secrets is accomplished in coordination with those bodies. 
  Article 20. Special regimen for the activity of 
enterprises, institutions and organizations 
  A special regimen for the activity of enterprises, 
institutions and organizations connected with state secrets 
(secrecy regimen) is instituted under the procedure established 
by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  Article 21. Access of citizens to state secrets 
  Access to state secrets is granted to competent citizens of 
Ukraine at least 18 years of age who require it under the terms 
of their official or scientific-research activity and who have 
completed the corresponding clearance under the procedure 
stipulated by this Law. 
  The decision to grant access to specific information that 
constitutes state secrets is made by the heads of the state 
bodies, enterprises, institutions and organizations at which the 
work is conducted or the information media connected with that 
information are stored. 
  A refusal to grant citizens of Ukraine access to specific 
information is possible only in the absence of the grounds 
stipulated in the first part of this article, and may be 
appealed to an official at a higher level to whom the official 
who refused the citizen access to specific information that 
constitutes state secrets is subordinate. The citizen, in the 
event the complaint is not satisfied, has the right to appeal 
the unlawful actions of officials to a court. 
  Foreign citizens and individuals without citizenship are 
granted access to state secrets in exceptional cases on the 
basis of international agreements or the written directive of 
the President of Ukraine. 
  Article 22. Clearance of citizens for state secrets 
  Clearance for state secrets is granted on the basis of the 
order of the head of the enterprise, institution or organization 
where the citizen is working, completing service or being 
educated. 
  If the need of a citizen for information that constitutes 
state secrets is not connected with the place of work or 
education, clearance may be granted at the place where the 
activity connected with the state secrets is being performed. 
  The granting of clearance envisages: 
  --determination of the necessity of the individual for the 
information that constitutes state secrets; 
  --checking out of the individual in connection with 
clearance 
to state secrets; 
  --assumption by the citizen of the obligations with regard 
to 
the safekeeping of the state secrets that will be entrusted to 
him; 
  --the receipt in written form of the citizen's agreement to 
the restrictions on rights as stipulated by legislation with 
regard to clearance to state secrets; 
  --familiarization of the citizen with the standards of 
responsibility for violations of legislation on state secrets. 
  The forms of clearance to the information necessary to the 
citizen ("particular importance," "top secret," "secret") are 
established independently of the extent of their secrecy. 
  Decisions on the clearance of a citizen to state secrets are 
made no later than five days after the completion of the 
check-out of the individual in connection with clearance to 
state secrets. 
  Article 23. Refusal to grant clearance to state 
secrets 
  Clearance to state secrets is not granted in a case: 
  1) the citizen's lack of a well-founded necessity for 
working 
with information that constitutes state secrets; 
  2) the ascertaining, in the course of checking the 
individual 
in connection with access to state secrets, of instances of his 
promoting the unlawful activity of the bodies of foreign nations 
and foreign organizations, or participation of the individual in 
associations of citizens whose activity is not subject to 
legalization or is prohibited under judicial procedure, or his 
failure to fulfill obligations with regard to the safekeeping of 
state secrets that were earlier entrusted to him;

"Public Companies," and shall be not less than 50,000 times the 
minimum wage defined at the moment of the registration of the 
investment company. 
  19. The investment company, in conducting its activity with 
regard to joint investments, is obligated to found a mutual 
fund, register the issue of investment certificates, and publish 
the investment declaration and information on the issue of 
investment certificates by it. The investment certificates that 
are issued by an investment company shall conform to the 
requirements stipulated in Paragraph 9 of this Statute. The 
restrictions indicated in Paragraph 17 with regard to investment 
funds extend to joint investments that are made by means of the 
issue of investment certificates of an investment company. An 
investment company obtains investment certificates in an amount 
that corresponds to the value of the property transferred by it 
to the mutual fund. The investment certificates of the founders 
are kept in a depositary, and may not be offered for sale. The 
restrictions indicated by Paragraph 4 of this Statute extend to 
the founders of an investment company that makes joint 
investments. 
  20. The mutual fund is an affiliate of the investment 
company 
that is created by decision of its supreme body. This body also 
approves the statute and the investment declaration of the 
mutual fund. The decision to create a mutual fund is considered 
to be made if no less than 3/4 of the shareholders 
(participants) present and taking part in the voting at a 
general meeting of the investment company have voted for it. The 
mutual fund has a separate balance sheet and business account, 
and is subject to state registration under the procedure 
envisaged for the registration of affiliates of the subjects of 
business activity. The investment company may transfer property 
in the form of securities and real property to the balance sheet 
of the mutual fund. Penalties under the obligations of an 
investment company not connected with the activity of the mutual 
fund may not be imposed on the property of a mutual fund. The 
investment company obtains profits from activity connected with 
joint investment in proportion to the value of the property 
transferred by it to the mutual fund, if not otherwise specified 
in the investment declaration. The investment company may found 
open or closed mutual funds that conduct activity pertaining to 
joint investment under the procedure stipulated by this Statute 
for investment funds. The investment company is obligated to 
submit information on the activity of the mutual fund to the 
general meeting of shareholders (participants) no less than once 
a year. 
<H5>  Section III. The Activity of an Investment Fund and a Mutual </H5>
Fund of an Investment Company Pertaining to Joint Investments 
  21. Investment funds, as well as investment companies, that 
have founded mutual funds (hereinafter, funds), issue investment 
certificates that are offered for placement among the 
participants in order to carry out joint investment. Open funds 
invest the funds that are received from the participants in 
securities of other issuers. Closed funds have the right to 
invest in securities and acquire real property, and the portions 
and shares that belong to the state in the property of public 
companies in the process of privatization. The investment 
certificates of open funds may be acquired for the funds of the 
participants, and those of closed funds for the funds of the 
participants and privatization vouchers. 
  22. The issue of investment certificates is accomplished 
after the registration of their issue at a financial body under 
the procedure defined by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The 
funds have the right to make a general issue of investment 
certificates in an amount whose size should not exceed 15 times 
the amount of their authorized capital. Open funds issue 
investment certificates that are not subject to unrestricted 
resale, and closed funds issue certificates that are subject to 
unrestricted resale. The investment certificates are offered for 
placement and are redeemed by the fund at a price that is equal 
to the value of the net assets, at the time stipulated by the 
investment declaration. The value of the assets in which the 
funds of the founders and participants of the fund are placed in 
current prices at the moment of valuation is deemed to be the 
net assets of the investment fund. 
  23. The investment certificates of closed funds may be 
exchanged for privatization vouchers, if those funds have 
received permission to carry out commercial activity with 
privatization vouchers under the procedure stipulated by the 
State Property Fund of Ukraine. The closed funds serve the 
owners of privatization vouchers with the restrictions that the 
investment certificates are subject to redemption by the fund no 
earlier than the conclusion of the term of utilization of the 
privatization vouchers, and that the participants in the 
investment fund are not guaranteed a fixed amount of dividends. 
Privatization vouchers that are under the ownership of the fund 
are subject to indexing in a case of the general indexing of 
privatization vouchers. The fund has the right to make 
additional issues of investment certificates at 50 times the 
amount of the privatization vouchers accepted for placement, 
under a procedure that is approved by the State Property Fund of 
Ukraine and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. 
  24. The valuation of the net assets of the fund is performed 
in accordance with the Statute on the Procedure for the 
Valuation of the Net Assets of Investment Funds and Mutual Funds 
of Investment Companies as approved by the Ministry of Finance 
of Ukraine. The value of the net assets per investment 
certificate of an open fund is calculated quarterly, on a date 
that is stipulated by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. A 
mutual fund is obligated to redeem the investment certificates 
from the fund participants at that price. 
  25. The income of the fund is formed from dividends and 
other 
receipts from securities that are under the ownership of the 
fund, and income from operations with securities and other 
assets. The income of the fund and its founders and participants 
is taxed in the payment of dividends under the procedure 
stipulated by prevailing legislation. The profits of the fund 
are subject to division among the founders and participants in 
the form of dividends. The profits of the founders of the fund 
may be applied, in accordance with the investment declaration, 
toward increasing the size of the authorized capital. 
  26. The fund composes and publishes information on its 
activity at the times and in the amounts that are defined by 
prevailing legislation. The accounting and monitoring of the 
activity of the fund with regard to the placement of 
privatization vouchers are performed under the procedure 
stipulated by the State Property Fund of Ukraine and the 
Ministry of Finance of Ukraine. The open funds are obligated to 
report to their participants every six months and publish in the 
press a financial report, which shall contain the accounting 
balance sheet with a listing of the investment fund (quantity, 
types and market value of the securities that are under the 
ownership of the fund), a report on income and expenses, as well 
as dividends paid over the period, a report on the value of the 
net assets of the fund, a report on the quantity of investment 
certificates issued by the fund, the nominal value of one 
investment certificate and the value of the net assets of one 
investment certificate as of the date of compilation of the 
report, and information on changes in the composition of 
affiliated individuals and members of the oversight council, as 
well as changes in the investment manager and depositary. The 
financial report on the results for the year must be verified by 
the auditor. Closed funds every six months publish the following 
data: the value of the net assets of the fund (including the 
value and quantity of non-utilized privatization vouchers that 
are certified by the findings of an auditing organization), a 
listing and the quantity of securities from a single issuer (in 
an amount greater than one percent of the assets of the fund) 
that are under the ownership of the fund, the value of other 
assets that are under the ownership of the fund, a report on the 
indebtedness of the fund, and data on the overall quantity of 
investment certificates of the fund that are in circulation at 
the end of the six months. The investment company conducts an 
accounting of the presence and circulation of the property of 
each mutual fund separately from its own property. The funds 
that place privatization vouchers are obligated to save the 
documents on all agreements made by them with privatization 
vouchers for a term of five years. If the funds are liquidated 
prior to that time, the documents on their activity with 
privatization vouchers are transferred to the State Property 
Fund. 
  27. State monitoring of the activity of a fund is provided 
for, in accordance with the Law of Ukraine "Securities and the 
Funds Exchange" and this Statute, by the Ministry of Finance of 
Ukraine and local financial bodies. State monitoring of the 
commercial activity of funds with privatization vouchers is 
provided by the State Property Fund of Ukraine. Violations of 
the requirements of this Statute entail civil, administrative 
and criminal liability in accordance with prevailing legislation. 
  28. Monitoring of the upholding of anti-monopoly legislation 
in the process of carrying out joint investment by an investment 
fund, investment company or mutual fund of an investment company 
is provided by the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine in 
accordance with prevailing legislation. The investment fund or 
investment company should inform the Anti-Monopoly Committee of 
Ukraine, either directly or through the investment manager, on 
their conclusion of agreements between the investment fund, 
investment company or mutual funds of an investment company and 
third parties pertaining to the acquisition of securities, as a 
result of which the fund or company obtains more than five 
percent of the securities of a single issuer. That information 
is submitted within five days from the moment of reaching the 
agreement on the purchase of the securities. 
  29. The fund curtails its activity in accordance with 
prevailing legislation and with a regard for the requirements 
stipulated by this Statute. Closed funds that serve the owners 
of privatization vouchers may be liquidated before the end of 
the time period for the use of privatization vouchers only by 
decision of a court of arbitration. In a case of the bankruptcy 
of an investment company, penalties may be imposed on the 
property of a mutual fund only after settlements with all 
participants in the mutual fund except the founders. The 
liquidation commission publishes in the print media, by location 
of the fund, information on its liquidation and the procedure 
and time periods for the making of claims by creditors. The 
commission shall publish the first information a week after its 
creation, and repeat it not less than twice for a period of two 
months. The property of the fund is sold exclusively at auction. 
The receipts from the sale are applied toward satisfying the 
demands of creditors. The funds that remain after this are 
distributed among the participants in proportion to the quantity 
of investment certificates. In a case where the value of the 
property per investment certificate is less than its nominal 
value, the difference to the participants is covered at the 
expense of the funds of the founders. The fund is considered to 
be liquidated from the moment of its deletion from the state 
register. A closed-type fund curtails its activity after the 
completion of the declared time frame. A closed fund may also be 
converted into an open fund by decision of its founders.
