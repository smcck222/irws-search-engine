<F P=106> [Report by Vladislav Borodulin and Yelena Kotelnikova under </F>
the rubric "Meeting of the Government Presidium": "Voucher 
Privatization Has a Successor"] 
  [Text] The numerous attempts of the members of the 
government to look past 1 July 1994 took the form of a document 
yesterday; at a closed meeting of the government, Anatoliy 
Chubays presented a five-page "Concept of Post-Check 
Privatization." But the meeting was closed for a different 
reason--the government was beginning to prepare for the 
"economic" meeting with Boris Yeltsin. 
  According to the authorized representative of the prime 
minister, Valentin Sergeyev, at the meeting reports were heard 
from several ministers on progress in fulfilling the 
government's March decree. This document is essentially the 
Chernomyrdin cabinet's program of action. As was expected, the 
ministries in fact failed to fulfill the decree and the premier 
expressed "dissatisfaction" with his subordinates' work. His 
discontent is even more justified since the top government 
officials are to meet with Boris Yeltsin in the near future. At 
that time the government is supposed to present its plan of 
action for the future. In a talk with the KOMMERSANT 
correspondent, the leader of the analytical group under the 
president, Aleksandr Livshits, noted: "The government holds 
meetings and discusses some matters, but the main thing is still 
lacking--reforms." He promised to "complain" about the 
government to the president. Thus, from Chernomyrdin's 
viewpoint, examining the concept of post-voucher privatization 
becomes crucial--some of the president's complaints regarding 
the lack of an overall concept in the work of the executive 
branch of power can be eliminated in that way. 
  The concept of the second stage of privatization prepared by 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Property Committee--GKI] specialists 
illustrates that the ideologues of denationalization are 
prepared not only to promote but even to defend the new 
priorities related above all to creating conditions needed to 
adapt to the market during an enterprise's privatization. Basic 
attention will now be devoted to selling large blocks of stock 
to those investors who are prepared to invest the most capital 
as soon as possible. Small investors will acquire stock at 
specialized auctions. All this differs fundamentally from the 
idea of voucher privatization, the essence of which is achieving 
social accord while implementing destatization 
["razgosudarstvleniye"] of enterprises by using checks as the 
main means of payment and granting preferences to the employees 
of the enterprises. But now GKI specialists acknowledge that 
voucher privatization has exhausted its social role (of the 
20,000 medium-sized and large enterprises subject to 
privatization, 80 percent have been made joint stock companies, 
and about 40 million citizens have become owners). The nature of 
the privatization procedures must also take into account the 
nonpayment crisis and the drop in production--standardized 
methods are unacceptable here. And the new concept is based on 
liberalizing those methods and individualizing the approach to 
each enterprise (bankrupt enterprises in particular), as well as 
extensively enlisting local authorities and interested 
ministries in the privatization process. This obviously gives a 
chance that not just the government will approve of the new 
concept. At the same time, however, the change in the tactics of 
privatization gives the GKI ideologues reason to expect that 
this process will remain under their department's control.

<F P=106> Interview with Sergey Glazyev, former RF Minister of Foreign </F>
Economic Relations, by Yuriy Kozlov, time and place not given] 
  [Text] Sergey Glazyev, formerly the youngest Russian 
minister, was born on 1 January 1961 in Zaporozhye. He graduated 
from MGU [Moscow State University] with distinction in the field 
of economic cybernetics. He is a doctor of sciences. He has 
published some 100 scholarly works and articles on issues of 
Soviet and Russian economic development. Since the early 1990's 
he has worked on problems of the structural crisis in the Soviet 
and Russian economy and development of approaches to overcome 
it. From 23 December 1992 to 21 September 1993 he was Russian 
minister of foreign economic relations. During the time that he 
worked in this post he was able to overcome the downward trend 
in exports, increase the export of finished products, and reach 
a stable positive balance of trade. He retired on 21 September 
1993 in disagreement with Presidential Edict No 1400, entitled 
"Constitutional Reform in Stages," which he believed violated 
the Constitution. He is a deputy to the State Duma and chairman 
of the State Duma Committee on foreign economic policy. 
  [Kozlov] Sergey Yuryevich, how would you describe the 
present 
state of affairs in the Russian economy? 
  [Glazyev] As not very reassuring. The paramount problem now 
is the state budget, a draft of which is being reviewed in the 
Duma right now. The actual economic policy which is concealed in 
this draft will not help the country out of economic crisis and 
gives no guarantees against plunging into hyperinflation and a 
disastrous decline in production. The validity of the 
macroeconomic hypothesis on which the draft budget is based 
raises grave doubts. The budget itself does not fit this 
hypothesis in its income and expenditure parts. For example, the 
income part for foreign economic activity is greatly 
understated. Budget income from the profit tax is exaggerated. 
  [Kozlov] And yet the budget was written by professionals... 
  [Glazyev] We can assume that they were guided by the 7-8 
percent growth rate which occurred at the end of last year. 
Beginning from this they calculated the approximate levels of 
income and expenditures. The reality, however, proved much 
harsher. According to expert estimates the drop in production 
may be much more than expected and could be somewhere on the 
order of 20-25 percent. Naturally, this will make it impossible 
to reduce the rate of inflation and will put the country on the 
brink of a plunge into hyperinflation. In January of this year 
the drop in machinebuilding production reached almost 50 percent 
compared with last year. Possibly this is not felt much in 
governmental structures, but the workers whose enterprises have 
shut down and the sectors whose production volume has decreased 
several times over are undergoing a disaster today. 
  [Kozlov] Can we speak of even a rough balance in the budget? 
  [Glazyev] There is an obvious discrepancy in priorities in 
the expenditure part. It is contemplated that enormous amounts 
of money will be spent to maintain the fuel-energy complex and 
agriculture, while inadequate amounts are envisioned for 
science-intensive industry, conversion, and stimulating growth 
in high-tech production areas. The obvious disproportions of the 
budget message, its unreliability to put it one way, lead me to 
think that we have to help the Government formulate a normal 
economic policy and an acceptable budget. 
  [Kozlov] Isn't that what the Supreme Soviet, of sad memory, 
was striving for? 
  [Glazyev] Well, so everything in life repeats itself. In all 
likelihood we will propose to the Government that they join 
forces with specialists from the State Duma. This kind of 
initiative is in the spirit of recent steps of the Federal 
Assembly, President, and the opposition to achieve civil peace 
and consensus. 
  [Kozlov] When can we expect adoption of a refined and 
amended 
budget? 
  [Glazyev] We must try to see that the country enters the 
second half of the year with a ratified budget for 1994. Then we 
will immediately be able to begin work on the budget for the 
next year. 
  [Kozlov] Incidentally, what happened to the recently 
published anticrisis program of academicians Abalkin, Petrakov, 
and Shatalin, the Saburov program, and indeed, your own program, 
Sergey Yuryevich? 
  [Glazyev] They were certainly considered in preparation of 
the President's Message to the Federal Assembly, but they were 
not actually reflected in the Government's economic policy. 
  [Kozlov] What do you think of the term "Ukainization of the 
economy?" Much has already been said about the similarity of 
negative processes occurring in the Russian and Ukrainian 
economies. What differences do you see? 
  [Glazyev] The term "Ukrainization" is improper from the 
start. Objectively speaking, Ukraine is in a completely 
different foreign economic situation than Russia. Russia today 
has a stable positive balance of trade with a very significant 
excess of export over import. Ukraine, on the contrary, has a 
large and chronic trade deficit. It seems to me that without 
large-scale foreign aid it will be hard for Ukraine to overcome 
its economic crisis. 
  [Kozlov] What can you say about the current structure of 
Russian export? The anticrisis program which you authored 
envisions mechanisms to get back the many billions of dollars 
which have settled in the foreign bank accounts of a small 
number of Russians. How do you intend to do this? 
  [Glazyev] The structure of Russian export has now changed 
for 
the worse. Its raw material component has intensified anew. As 
for domestic capital abroad, by last summer the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations had introduced a system to monitor 
foreign currency revenue from export of raw materials. It was 
fairly well thought out and had technical support, but 
unfortunately, in the second half of the year it practically 
ceased operations. We were not able to stop the leakage of 
foreign currency income abroad. Generally speaking, there is 
nothing difficult in monitoring export and import. The 
appropriate instruments have been well-known for a long time. 
Everything depends on the desire of the Central Bank, Ministry 
of Finance, State Customs Committee, and Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations to take the appropriate measures. Judging by 
everything, they still do not have this desire. But everything 
is determined by the macroeconomic situation in the country. 
Repressive measures produce little here. But if conditions for 
stabilization are secured the investment climate will change for 
the better and legal capital will begin to return. As for 
investment by Russian natural and legal persons in physical 
assets abroad, in particular in real estate, this capital is 
lost forever. 
  [Kozlov] What is your attitude toward the method established 
in Russia for determining the exchange rate of the ruble in 
auctions at the interbank currency exchange? How well does the 
rate that is formed correspond to the actual ratio of the ruble 
and the dollar? 
  [Glazyev] It seems to me that determination of the exchange 
rate should be a significant, independent element of government 
economic policy. The rate today is established in a largely 
unplanned way. It is subject to such fluctuations that exporters 
and importers cannot make long-term or even medium-term 
forecasts. It is essential to have an exchange rate policy that 
is independent, intelligible, and predictable for all 
participants in economic activity. I do not think that the 
exchange rate of the ruble today is too low, though. That is, of 
course, if you do not take account of non-commodity, embodied 
Russian assets. The stock market, the market for capital still 
has not started working in Russia. Therefore the exchange rate 
is formed exclusively in the commodity market. 
  [Kozlov] The last 100 days of voucher privatization have 
come. In your view, has it been possible to accomplish the 
assigned tasks within the framework of the model chosen by 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on Administration of State 
Property]? 
  [Glazyev] I do not think so. Effective ownership mechanisms 
have not been created in the economy. We do not know who 
three-quarters of the privatized enterprises today belong to. If 
we consider the fact that 80 percent of the commercial banks 
were formed by industrial enterprises, we will see that the 
ownership system which has developed among them is the system of 
an undeveloped market economy--the so-called "Yugoslav model." 
It leads to chronic depression, galloping inflation, economic 
disintegration, and separatism. Perhaps the time has come to 
look around and move toward creation of an effective system of 
market-based ownership relations and not carry this hopeless 
scheme to its final "triumph." 
  [Kozlov] On the one hand everyone talks of consensus and 
national reconciliation, while on the other they intimidate you 
with another round of confrontation... 
  [Glazyev] The dividing line does not run between advocates 
and opponents of the reforms. It lies between those who want to 
establish order, attain economic success, and overcome the 
crisis and those who continue to rock the boat, instill 
radicalism in public opinion, frighten the people with civil 
war, and stir things up, creating muddy waters which they 
themselves take advantage of.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zverev, chairman of the </F>
Inter-Departmental Commission for Economic Security of the 
Russian Federation Security Council: "The Reforms and the 
Country's Economic Security"] 
  [Text] The forecasts of political scientists and 
economists about a possible economic collapse are not so far 
from the truth. The most important economic and social 
indicators bear witness: a headlong drop is continuing in 
practically all sections of the national economy. In comparison 
with 1992 the gross domestic product has declined by 12 percent 
and the physical volume of production by 16.2 percent. A real 
threat to the economic security of the country has emerged. What 
are its basic features and what needs to be done in order to 
deflect the approaching calamity from Russia? The author of this 
report reflects on these and other questions. 
  In the strongly centralized unitary state with a planned 
economy that was the USSR, the problem of economic security was 
to a considerable extent subordinate in importance relative to 
military and foreign policy activity and concentrated primarily 
on the maintenance and augmentation of the resources of the 
defense industry and of state reserves and the barring of a 
large payments balance deficit. The main goal of the solution of 
these problems was to secure the economic, military, and 
ideological invulnerability of the country from external forces. 
Internal security was maintained in general by non-economic 
methods. 
  Under the present conditions of the absence of a single 
national economic plan and the contradictory action of market 
mechanisms, the achieving of the country's economic security 
requires special economic, informational, and managerial 
procedures. 
  What is meant here? 
  The economic security of any state presumes such a state of 
its economy under which, as a result of steady progressive and 
efficient economic development, internal social and political 
stability and the required defense potential, defined as the 
level of reasonable sufficiency, is secured, the country's 
international economic position is strengthened, its position on 
world markets becomes stronger, and its political role and 
influence in the world community is increased. 
  This problem has become extremely acute in our time. The 
achievement of economic security is determined both by external 
factors--the drastically increased openness of the Russian 
economy to the world market and the intensification of its 
dependence on its active influence--and by internal causes 
related to the acquisition of economic development mechanisms 
and stimuli completely different than before. 
  The command-administrative system has been dismantled. 
Centralized planning relationships are being more and more 
widely replaced by market mechanisms--economic interest and 
consumer demand. Thus, already in 1993, only a year after the 
beginning of large-scale reforms, the volumes and list of 
products being produced, intersectorial relations and 
proportions, the utilization of the capacities of enterprises 
and their operating mode have been practically totally 
determined by demand, market requirements, and financial 
limitations. This is the most important result of the reforms 
under way--the development of market relationships and a 
beginning to orienting production to authentic and realistic 
requirements. 
  At the same time, analysis of economic development in 
1992-1993 reveals that far from all the shifts and 
transformations taking place under the influence of the market 
correspond to Russia's national interests and its economic 
security. While positively evaluating the movement toward a 
market economy, one nevertheless needs to note the continuously 
increasing excessive "price" which society has already paid and 
will be forced to pay for the strategy and tactics selected for 
the conversion to the market. The scale of the present crisis 
and its internal structure are having an extremely painful 
effect on the solution of social problems and are fraught with 
the irreversible destruction of the country's economic and 
scientific-technical potential. 
  During the last two years alone the drop in production based 
on the most important macroindicators has come to about 30 
percent, and relative to the pre-crisis level has approached 40 
percent (even more according to some estimates). The drop in 
production during the last two years is steady in character from 
month to month (with certain individual exceptions). At the same 
time it is important to emphasize that recently the drop in 
production, which in some measure was previously structural in 
character, is acquiring the attributes of universal degradation, 
striking the most progressive and highly technological sectors 
and types of production to the greatest degree. Under present 
conditions the loss of production volumes is the loss of a 
market, moreover not only the world market but also the internal 
market. Once having yielded place on the market, occupying this 
niche anew is extremely complicated. 
  Collosal slumps in production, primarily in the fuel 
sectors, 
the emerging deficits of resources intended for maintaining the 
army and fleet in proper condition even now do not permit one to 
provide the required regimen of training exercises, drill, and 
sometimes even of operational duty. An enormous number of 
warships are at anchor. The air and ground armed forces are not 
performing the full volume of training programs. 
  The state doesn't have the right to further withdraw from 
the 
fact that the greatest demand limitations and drop in production 
are observed primarily with respect to products which can in no 
way be placed in the category of the non-competitive and, 
especially, of the unnecessary. Thus, given an overall drop in 
production in 1993 of 16 percent, the output of mineral 
fertilizers fell by 22 percent, protein feed--by 33 percent, 
rolled sheet--by 21 percent, diesel locomotives--by 33 percent, 
tractors--by 35 percent, fabrics--by 27 percent, and shoes--by 
34 percent. It is impossible not to take note also of the 
uncontrollably developing redistribution of industrial output in 
the direction of the raw material sectors. 
  The debate concerning the degree of the interference of the 
state in the economic life of society and first of all in the 
sphere of money-credit and financial relations has become the 
core of discussions concerning the subsequent paths of the 
reforms. This dispute is not original. The fact is that the role 
of the state in regulating the economy was discussed over the 
centuries. With us this problem has boiled down to rather 
primitive questions--is there a Gosplan [State Planning 
Committee] in Japan or isn't there, will the government allot 
money for the agro-industrial complex or quite the opposite? So 
low a level of discussion indicates at least two things--first, 
the unwillingness of the "marketeers" to debate about rather 
incontrovertible and obvious things, and precisely about the 
fact that the state in Western countries in actual fact actively 
and at times even aggresively interferes in all spheres of the 
economy and, secondly, the inadequate theoretical level of their 
opponents, the "statists," who don't know, apparently, that 
there was such a scholar as J. M. Keynes, who has created a 
doctrine under the name of "Keynesianism," the basic idea of 
which is precisely the interference of the state in the economy. 
  Let us note, however, that to argue about who is right, 
Keynes or Friedman, and whose recommendations to adhere to 
during the conversion to the market, means to run to the same 
extremes by which the disciples of the plan and of the market 
sinned at the end of the 1980's, or, let's say, to assert that 
it's better to break an egg from the blunt end and not from the 
sharp end. 
  One-sidedness is also quite fatal under our conditions of 
market conversion. One can encounter the idea that it is enough 
to "liberate" prices and to not interfere in the economy and all 
will be in order, the hostages of which we are already for the 
third year, perhaps only in textbooks as an illustration of how 
one must not do. 
  The key thought of the adherents of the "Chicago school" is 
to overcome inflation at any price. In the process the 
sequestering of budget expenditures and the reduction of the 
money supply emerge as the main weapon of this struggle. 
However, it is generally known that inflation is a category not 
only of the sphere of monetary circulation but also of 
production. In essence, inflation is a multi-factor process 
which affects both monetary circulation and production. This is 
an axiom. That is why to restrict emission while not paying 
attention to the catastrophic state of affairs in industry is a 
fatal policy. Of course, it is possible to not pay debts to the 
budgetary sphere for the sake of lowering the inflation level 
but what happens with debtors is well known. A bitter hangover 
after the banquet of the "deflationists" of 1992-1993 awaits the 
economy in the spring and summer. 
  It would be a dangerous delusion to assert that a given 
model 
approved in other countries is suited for Russia. Yes, of 
course, there are economic laws which operate in any country. 
But the conclusion that Freidman's doctrine is eternal because 
it is true should not at all follow from this. Russia needs its 
own path, which under present conditions can be formulated as 
"stop and go," simply put, to balance on a tightrope, to pass 
between the Scylla of hyperinflation and the Charybdis of mass 
unemployment and social shocks. 
  Let's examine, for example, the extraordinarily complex 
situation developing in the agrarian sector of the economy. 
Agrarian reform is a measure which has long since come to a head 
which is directed to the creation of a mixed agricultural system 
and its adaptation to market relationships. At the same time, 
while the overall trend of the reform is positive, the agrarian 
sector is presently in profound crisis. The reform began here 
spontaneously to a certain degree, which has had an effect on 
the character of its development. Despite the great number of 
decisions adopted, up to now we don't have an integral program 
for the development of the agrarian sector even for the next few 
years. 
  Meanwhile, the situation with the supplying of the 
population 
with foodstuffs even earlier (prior to 1990) represented the 
most important problem of achieving economic security and always 
was a cause giving rise to social tension. The population's 
tobacco and milk "riots" of 1990 and 1991, which took place even 
with a higher saturation of the food market than now, are 
memorable. The transition to a market system of food 
distribution--when its shortage is manifested not in empty store 
counters but in the weekly increase in the prices of top 
priority food products--at first glance somewhat lessens the 
acuteness of the problem. However, such a situation cannot last 
for long. The social tension in this sphere remains hidden so 
far and does not spill out into the streets. However, with a 
continuing tendency towards an increase in the prices for basic 
foodstuffs and a simultaneous reduction of real money incomes, 
ever broader strata of the population can slide into a situation 
that is "beyond the limit" for them. And this is fraught with 
the manifestation of very serious social consequences. 
  The drop in investment activity is no less profound and 
dangerous regarding its social and political consequences. 
During the last two years alone the volume of investments in the 
Russian economy has shrunk more than two times and today comes 
to about 40 percent of the pre-crisis level. With such 
investments there can be no talk not only of expanded but also 
of simple reproduction. Not only progressive structural 
reorganization, but even simple maintenance of production 
volumes at a fixed level, is impossible. The special criticality 
of the situation in the investment sphere is related to the fact 
that the depreciation of fixed production capital is approaching 
60 percent, i.e., the threshold beyond which the destruction of 
the country's production potential begins. 
  The basic factors which have been responsible for the 
investments crisis have been primarily high inflation and the 
drop in production. Inflation has especially strongly restricted 
the internal investment opportunities of the enterprises and 
substantially reduced the basic source of capital 
investments--depreciation allotments. The complex financial 
situation of the enterprises has not permitted them to 
compensate for the reduction of the real volume of depreciation 
allotments by funds from profit, which were distributed in the 
direction of current consumption. The internal funds of the 
enterprises being directed to investment are inadequate already 
even for the simple reproduction of fixed capital. At the same 
time, under conditions of high inflation, the banks are not 
interested in granting long-term loans of an investment 
character, in connection with which about 60 percent of all 
capital investments are accounted for by the meager internal 
funds of the enterprises. Some 15 percent of the financing from 
the republic budgets and 16 percent from local budgets came from 
centralized funds in 1993. In 1993, of 149 facilities for which 
commissioning at the expense of budget funds in accordance with 
the federal program was envisaged, only 10 have been 
commissioned. 
  The process of the accumulation of incomplete construction, 
the volume of which increased by 20-25 percent in 1993, 
continues. 
  Despite the increase in the influx of foreign investment 
into 
the Russian economy ($400 million USA in 1993 as compared with 
$290 million in 1992), their amounts remain still so 
insignificant that they don't play any appreciable role in the 
overall process. 
  The problem of increasing proven mineral resources requires 
special attention. The inadequate financing of geological 
exploration work has resulted in the disruption of the required 
ratios between production and the growth of new reserves. For 
example, for normal reproduction it is necesssary to accrue 2.5 
tonnes of new reserves for every tonne of oil produced. In 1993 
oil production amounted to 352 million tonnes but the growth of 
reserves to only a little more than 300 million tonnes. This 
threatens a drastic drop in the production of oil in the future, 
the overcoming of which will require very lengthy periods of 
time. The same situation is developing with respect to many 
non-ferrous metals and, in particular, with respect to gold. As 
a result Russia, which possesses enormous potential mineral 
reserves, may find itself on the verge of a fuel and raw 
material famine. 
  The expanding crisis has also struck the sphere of science 
(including basic and sectorial, planning and design work and 
experimental production). First-class, world level, collectives 
are breaking up. Leadership in a number of directions of 
scientific and technical progress is being lost and the material 
base is hopelessly aging. The country is losing intellectual 
potential and with it also hopes for the revival and prosperity 
of Russia. 
  The state of scientific and technical potential should be 
evaluated as critical, which directly broaches questions of the 
country's economic security. The crisis in the 
scientific-technical sphere, which is reflected in the drastic 
decrease in the share of expenditures for science, the reduction 
in the number of those employed in this sphere, and the closing 
of a number of scientific schools with a world recognition with 
respect to certain very important directions of basic research 
strategically dooms the country to technical backwardness and 
undermines its scientific and technical independence. 
  The drastically increasing openness of the Russian economy 
to 
the world market and the increase in its dependence on its 
active influence should be included, first of all, among the 
external factors exacerbating the problems of economic security. 
  Historically, the structure of Russia's export-import 
relationships developed under conditions of a "directive" 
economy and "willful" prices, which in many respects do not 
correspond to real material and labor costs. This determined the 
substantial effectiveness of foreign trade at the level of the 
high world prices for the goods being exported from Russia. 
  With the transition to market relationships and the gradual 
establishment of equilibrium prices for exported and imported 
goods, the effectiveness of foreign-trade relationships is 
undergoing substantial deformation, which already at the present 
time is resulting in the transformation of relations in foreign 
trade. 
  The correlation of external and internal prices will give a 
rather clear idea about the change in the effectiveness of 
foreign trade. At the same time the dynamics of external world 
prices is under the substantial influence of Russian exports, 
especially in those cases when trading operations are being 
carried out at dumping prices. 
  The most negative processes connected with the effectiveness 
of foreign trade are to be noted with respect to petroleum 
products and non-ferrous metals. Thus, for petroleum products 
internal prices are ever more persistently approaching world 
prices, which already makes their export unprofitable in 
comparison with the export of crude oil. Such a situation is not 
to be observed in any of the petroleum-exporting countries. The 
effectiveness of export is steadily decreasing for all 
non-ferrous metals. Among export goods a significant excess of 
internal prices over external is still maintained only for crude 
oil, although even here the process of a definite convergence of 
these prices is present. At the same time, apparently, crude oil 
will still be able to remain a profitable export resource for 
some limited time. 
  The rather high volume of exports in 1993 has been achieved, 
basically, through a significant increase in the physical volume 
of raw material exports. However, such growth has not resulted 
in a growth of foreign currency earnings identical to it. In 
comparison to 1992 the effectiveness of the export of petroleum 
products has come to 67 percent, that of phosphate 
fertilizers--52 percent, fabrics--66 percent, and aluminum--66 
percent. 
  An increase in the effectiveness of foreign trade has been 
noted only for ammonia and nitrogen fertilizers (109 and 156 
percent respectively). 
  The steady dynamics of a reduction of the effectiveness of 
the export of basic resources and the convergence of the 
internal prices for these resources with world prices poses the 
problem of the prospects of Russian foreign-trade relations and 
of Russia's place in the international system of the division of 
labor exceptionally acutely. 
  This question is becoming further exacerbated against the 
background of the convergence of external and internal prices 
for imported goods (primarily foodstuffs). The trend now 
beginning to show brings Russia closer to the place of an 
exporter of primary raw material resources, an exporter of 
products whose production is the most "dirty" and ecologically 
dangerous. 
  Determination of the most important parameters 
characterizing 
the population's living conditions and standard and elimination 
of the possibility of social, national, territorial and other 
conflicts is the most important task of achieving economic 
security. 
  Price liberalization and restraint of the growth of wages 
and 
social payments has led to a drastic fall in the real value of 
the population's money incomes. Miscalculations and errors in 
the development and implementation of the economic policy of 
recent years have resulted in the catastrophic reduction of the 
people's living standard. The nominal increase in the 
population's monetary incomes in comparison with the end of 1991 
has been able to half compensate for the growth of prices. Based 
on the level of the consumption of goods Russia has found itself 
thrown back to 10-20 years ago. 
  One of the most negative results of the economic refoms 
being 
carried out has been the drastic fall in the real value of the 
population's money savings. The deflator of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) has increased 431 times since 1991. As for the 
financial assets of the population being kept in the Savings 
Bank, they have increased only 6.5 times. Thus, taking the 
reduction of the purchasing power of the ruble into account, the 
monetary savings of the population have been devaluated by 98.5 
percent. 
  According to the calculations of the Ministry of Labor a 
stratum of super-rich people, about three million persons, 
exists in Russia at the present time. Primarily these are the 
heads of brokerage firms, commercial banks and exchanges and 
persons engaged in export-import operations. One should also 
group with them the representatives of the criminal 
world--corrupted representatives of the executive power and the 
leaders of organized crime who form part of the group of the 
population possessing super-high incomes. The primary sources of 
the initial accumulation of capital are: speculation, usury, the 
appropriation of rent revenues which previously went to the 
state, as well as criminal activity. Thus, society is rapidly 
stratifying into a relatively small prosperous stratum and the 
basic mass of the population which is growing poorer. According 
to the data of the Ministry of Labor the "poorest" constitute on 
the order of 40-50 percent, and the "ordinary poor" 30-35 
percent of the population. 
  The most numerous in the past middle layer of the population 
today comes to only 10-15 percent. A drastic deterioration of 
its professional and social structure is occurring at the same 
time. Previously skilled workers, the intelligentsia, and 
managers basically represented the middle class. Now all these 
strata have sunk to the social bottom. The growing distinction 
in the sphere of material goods depends on personal efforts only 
to a minor degree. The enrichment of some through the 
impoverishment of others is taking place on a scale never seen 
before. 
  The level of the education and the skill of the overwhelming 
portion does not correspond to the size of their wages since the 
social stratification that is going on both by its scale and by 
its directions does not correspond with the changes in the 
economy and the structure of the population's employment, the 
parameters of which are equal to the majority of developed 
countries. 
  There are no objective preconditions in the present year of 
1994 for a change in the trends that have developed. Apparently, 
the forming of a very extensive, but possessing insufficient 
purchasing power, lowest stratum of the population, which will 
be compelled to direct all its monetary incomes to satisfy 
primary needs and not for savings, will continue. The 
preconditions for creating a base for stable economic growth are 
also thereby undermined. 
  The most important task for assuring economic security is 
achievement of the economy's resistance to external influences 
and its ability to quickly and effectively adapt to changing 
conditions. Relationships of an excessive dependence on external 
factors develop otherwise. Thus, excessive dependence on 
external deliveries of components and materials and a high share 
of imports in the consumption of foodstuffs are factors which 
impair the country's economic security. 
  In the final analysis security from external influences 
means 
the attaining of national sovereignty in the area of control 
over production resources and retention of independence in the 
sphere of developing and conducting economic policy. It stands 
in the way of the establishment of the effective control of 
foreign companies over the key sectors and individual most 
important enterprises of Russia. 
  Under conditions of an increase in spontaneity in the 
economy, given inadequate legal regulation, the difference in 
prices on the internal and world markets, the low ruble exchange 
rate and high rates of inflation, commodity-money flows, being 
inevitably subordinate to the law of the maximumization of 
profit, are oriented primarily to external relations. The chief 
negative consequence of this is primarily the outflow of capital 
from the country, proceeding mainly through illegal deals, and 
the intensified export of strategic raw material. A real drain 
of material and financial resources from the country is taking 
place, which undermines prospects for economic stabilization. 
  The high degree of its foreign debt is a significant 
external 
disturbing factor for Russia's economy. 
  The factors mentioned bring Russia's attention acutely to 
the 
problem of achieving foreign currency and credit security. At 
the present moment the state doesn't have a sufficient quantity 
of foreign currency to service the external debt. The country's 
credit rating, which could ensure access to world credit, is 
very low. And that is why we need to the highest degree a 
foreign currency policy which would prevent the drain of foreign 
currency from the country and promote its influx into Russia. 
  The process of privatization under way can potentially serve 
as one of the threats to economic security. This is connected 
primarily with an exchange rate of the ruble relative to the 
dollar which is extraordinarily low and is continuing to fall. 
By virtue of this the need arises to protect state property from 
cheap sale and from the establishment of the control of foreign 
capital over key sectors of the economy. 
  Quite reasonable and well-founded complaints about the 
extremely low profitability of privatization and about the 
exclusion of commercial structures, primarily the banks, from 
this process are now being expressed ever more frequently. A 
concept of coordination and interconnection between the 
structural policy of the state and its share in the capital of 
enterprises being made joint-stock companies (the so-called 
golden share) is also lacking. 
  The growing unemployment is also connected with the 
privatization process to a considerable degree. The overall 
number of unemployed in Russia came to 3.8 million persons at 
the end of January 1994, including the 893,600 persons 
officially registered in the employment service. However, this 
is only the beginning. A sudden surge of unemployment awaits us 
in the very near future, to which, firstly, the start of 
"voucher-less" privatization, secondly, extension of the process 
of clearing up the finances (sanirovaniye) and of the bankruptcy 
of enterprises, thirdly, the coming broad diffusion of the 
circulation of bills of exchange (veksel) and the right secured 
in the law of recourse to the recovery of debts on the property 
of debtors unable to pay, and, finally, fourth, the forthcoming 
sale of the "golden" shares, which as is known, were left in 
state ownership only for three years, will contribute. 
  The prompt development of mechanisms for regulating the 
labor 
market as well as for the social protection of the temporary 
non-working population is necessary in this connection. 
  By now crime in Russia has come to represent a real threat 
to 
Russia's national security and the course of the reforms that 
are underway. Like in a mirror, Russian crime reflects the 
overall state of our society and, first of all, its 
foundation--the economy. Organized crime is especially dangerous 
in a period of political and economic changes. More than 4,000 
organized criminal associations have been unmasked in Russia; 
moreover, every fourth one of them is protected by corrupted 
officials in various structures. According to expert estimates, 
up to 40 percent of the entrepreneurs and two-thirds of all 
commercial structures have been drawn into these relationships. 
  The growth of social and political instability and the 
weakening of state structures is not the least of the factors in 
the expansion of crime. Corruption represents a special danger. 
The illegal utilization of a state post to obtain personal 
benefits is a special "culture medium" for criminal groupings. 
However, the most terrible thing in this abnormal phenomenon is 
the fact that the corruptability of officials of the law 
enforcement and other state institutions engenders among the 
public a profound distrust of the authorities and undermines the 
faith of the people in the law and the state. 
  The striving of organized crime to penetrate the country's 
economy increases. Arguments are being heard lately that the 
investment of illegally obtained funds in the legal economy will 
contribute to its stabilization. World experience indicates that 
organized criminal activity destabilizes all areas of the 
economy and upsets the natural action of market forces, since 
the huge revenues of criminal groups are taken out of normal 
market circulation. 
  And that is why it is quite obvious that curbing crime is a 
national task. It must be carried on in parallel with all 
measures to strengthen Russian statehood but be implemented far 
more rapidly and effectively. 
  An especial threat to the security of Russia as a state is 
that today the same disintegrating processes which led to the 
break-up of the USSR are gathering force in Russia. Apart from 
the very complex ganglions of inter-nationality contradictions 
conveyed to us as a legacy from the past, no less acute problems 
are emerging as derivatives from the present state of the 
economy. 
  The new growths of a civilized economy and hopes for 
national 
rebirth of peoples have in many instances become the hostages of 
extreme forces, political adventureres of various kinds, and 
criminal and corrupted structures. Inter-regional and 
inter-nationality conflicts and the weakness of the federal 
power are leading to the appearance of local dictator candidates 
who play the separatism card, behind which only a striving for 
unchecked power is quite often to be divined. 
  The process of the delimitation of the powers of the center 
and the territories proceeds spontaneously. The regional organs 
of administration either secretly appropriate extra powers to 
themselves or get them with the help of various edicts, decrees 
and directives. The lack of solution of the problem of budget 
federalism, which has provoked a very real tax war with the 
center, has become a problem of economic security. The result of 
this is the delay of tax transfers to the federal budget. The 
actual inequality of the territores both in the creation of the 
revenue portion of the budget and also in the distribution of 
subsidies, which together with other factors has been a cause 
for the process of sovereignty declaration which has begun, has 
become more pronounced. 
  There are a great number of examples of the granting of 
privileges to individual regions. The situation when its 
economic situation depends on the status of the region is the 
objective basis of the striving of subjects "done out of their 
share" for an increase in their own status and a declaration of 
sovereignty. 
  The differentiation of regions according to the level of 
economic development inherited as a legacy from the past is 
being further intensified through the ignoring of the regional 
sector in the policy of the reforms being carried out. The 
regions where the sectors which have found themselves 
"depressed" at the present stage--light industry, non-ferrous 
metallurgy, the timber industry, the chemical industry, the 
military-industrial complex--were dominant in the structure of 
production have turned out to be in the most difficult economic 
situation. 
  The transition to market relationships and the weakening and 
rejection of the state regulation that previously existed, which 
at least to some degree maintained the balanced nature of 
inter-regional development, has intensified the acuteness and 
contradictoriness of territorial problems. As a result almost 
the entire territory of Russia now has problem regions of 
various kinds. A complex and extreme social and economic 
situation is characteristic for all the zones of the North and 
the militarized regions of the Center, the Urals, and South 
Siberia. The social and economic degradation of Kalmykia, Tuva, 
the republics of the Northern Caucasus and certain regions of 
the Non-Chernozem Zone is accelerating against the background of 
the weakening of territorial regulation. 
  In connection with these ever more sensitive problems the 
achievement of economic security at the regional level is 
becoming more urgent. This gives rise to the immediate need for 
developing as rapidly as possible an economic mechanism of 
federal relations and for developing firm and unshakeable 
principles for the interrelations of the Center with the 
subjects of the Federation. 
  The government is taking steps to achieve stabilization in 
the economy. In this connection it is important to note that at 
the 4 March expanded session of the government it was decided to 
examine such questions as the development of the budget system 
of the Russian Federation in 1995, which envisages the further 
improvement of the process of budget formation, strengthening 
budget discipline, improvement of the tax system, and the 
putting of accounts in the national economy in good order, etc., 
in as short a time as possible. The solution of these questions 
as soon as possible may change the situation in the economy for 
the better. 
  In summing up what has been said, let us note that the 
situation can get out of control in the very near future. A 
situation may emerge which chess-players call tsugtsvang [as 
transliterated]--each new move leads to a worsening of position. 
And then, despite all the calamities of the last two years, this 
period will appear as a time of universal prosperity. 
  Now, it seems, it is necessary to consider the basic 
approaches and criteria for the introduction of a state of 
economic and financial emergency. Many are thinking and writing 
about this, but it is not clear what this means and what 
specific forms and mechanisms it is to take. The development of 
such a concept is an urgent matter. 
  In principle the notion of "emergency" is alien to Russia 
and 
to Russians. During recent years the people have repeatedly 
lived in emergency conditions. A normal, stable situation and 
the creation of a favorable climate for the domestic producer 
are, on the contrary, needed now. Preferably one needs in the 
economy not a special or emergency situation but the setting 
(even legislatively) of basic macroeconomic 
parameters--regarding the gross domestic product, the budget 
deficit, inflation, unemployment, etc.--lower than which one 
cannot sink in any case whatsoever. 
  We have touched upon only some of the problems which to one 
degree or another determine the country's economic security. The 
development of a "National Economic Security Doctrine," which 
will define its basic criteria and give concrete expression to 
them in a system of economic and production indicators, is the 
most important task of the country's administration at the 
present time. The system of criteria and evaluations created 
must serve as a guide for the activity of the Government so as 
to not permit the approach of the economy to dangerous limits 
and to reduce the risk of harming Russia's vitally important 
interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "The Commission on </F>
Operational Questions: The Antimonopoly Committee Revolted 
Against the System"] 
  [Text] The members of the governmental commission on 
operational questions yesterday unequivocally accepted the 
opinion of the Antimonopoly Committee that fundamental reform of 
the Russian system of goods certification is needed. However, 
the GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of 
New Economic Structures] did not really expect to convince all 
opponents immediately; obviously one of its objectives was 
simply acquainting first vice premier Oleg Soskovets with an 
alternative viewpoint on this problem. 
  Sergey Bezverkhiy, chairman of the Committee on 
Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, presented his 
view of the department's problems in present conditions. 
According to him, Russia has now joined three international 
certification systems and is already completing negotiations to 
join several others (certification of metals, composites, and 
railway transport). But there are a number of unresolved 
problems in the domestic system. Above all this means the weak 
legislative base; in Russia only 6 normative enactments "cover" 
this area, while there are 33 of them in Japan, 160 in the 
United States, and more than 300 in the European Community. 
Moreover, the switch from the Soviet certification system to a 
purely Russian one--GOST R [All-Russian State Standard]--must be 
accompanied by a concurrent reworking of the "Soviet" standards. 
But the Committee's capabilities do not allow it to conduct 
refinement of the 26,000 old GOST's quickly. 
  Oleg Soskovets gave his opinion on the report briefly: 
"Resounding, but nonsensical." The first vice premier treated 
the Antimonopoly Committee expert's report, which generally 
questioned the feasibility of preserving the Russian 
certification system in the present form, with much greater 
attention. In the GKAP's opinion, at least two defects are 
inherent in it. The first is, that from a practical standpoint, 
the mandatory procurement of a certificate of compliance with 
national GOST's (which, incidentally, is a purely Russian 
invention) provides the Russian exporter with no advantage--the 
quality of the Russian (Soviet) standards themselves is yet to 
be proven in the West. By the way, even on the domestic market 
the system of total certification has not resulted in better 
quality goods. The second defect is that monitoring and 
commercial functions are combined in the Committee--the right to 
issue certificates of compliance is delegated only to testing 
centers and laboratories under the Committee's jurisdiction. At 
the present time, GKAP specialists possess information on 
"arrangements" (for example, by the certification company 
"Rostest-Moskva" [Russia-test Moscow] with Moscow customs) which 
result in the formation of a monopoly on this type of services. 
  [First Box] 
  During the period 1992-1993, more than 225,000 certificates 
were issued on Russian output, including 180,000 for foodstuffs. 
Moreover, about 108,000 certificates were issued for imported 
output, and of them about 100,000 were for food products. More 
than 2,600 types of goods did not receive certificates because 
they did not meet safety requirements, and that includes 2,000 
types of food products. 
  [Second Box] 
  Russia has joined the following international certification 
systems: 

  -  highway transport means certification system 
(Geneva Convention of the United Nations European Economic 
Commission); 
  -  MEK [International Electrotechnical Commission] 
electrical equipment testing system for compliance with safety 
standards (accreditation of Russian laboratories within its 
framework scheduled for May 1994); 
  -  Brussels Convention on Mutual 
Recognition of Control Marks for Firearms and Ammunition 
(accreditation of Russian laboratories scheduled for June 1994).

<F P=106> [Survey results reported by Professor O. Mushtuk, head of </F>
the Political Sociology Department of the Moscow Institute of 
Economic Statistics and director of the Institute of Political 
Management of the the Moscow International University of 
Business and Information Technologies: "Business: A Group 
Portrait Against the Background of Politics"] 
  [Text] Among the mysterious strangers who have suddenly 
appeared in society as a result of Russia's movement toward the 
market, perhaps the most unfamiliar and mysterious is the 
class of Russian entrepreneurs. Because of the almost 
complete absence of reliable information on the entire range of 
"specific" characteristics of this class, it is more likely to 
be perceived by many Russians with a "minus" sign rather than a 
"plus": if one is not a "highway robber," then he is not "one 
involved in hard work." 
  This perception is far from wrong all the time. However, it 
can hardly be considered a mirror image, that is, an objective 
reflection of reality. It should be taken into account that in 
the exceptionally complex and agonizing processes of "class 
formation" and "class creation," it is not always what comes to 
the surface and is apparent to the naked eye that represents the 
deep-seated essence of a phenomenon. In order to establish a 
really true picture of what is taking place, painstaking work 
with "reality"--that is, serious scientific research work by 
sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists who are 
engaged in applied science in the very midst of the 
entrepreneurial class--is required. 
  The Center for Political Research attached to the Institute 
of Political Management of the Moscow International University 
of Business and Information Sciences [MMUBiIT] conducted a 
survey of students in a special department of the institute in 
February. These are young Moscow entrepreneurs (average age 30 
to 35) who work in the finance field and are studying the 
"subtleties" of market economics in time "outside their 
principal employment"; they are clearly aware that their future 
(and the future of Russia's entire entrepreneurial class, 
incidentally) depends primarily on knowledge. The 33 respondents 
were given a questionnaire with testing elements in the 
questions integrated with the problem of relationships between 
business and politics. 
  Question: Which of the three definitions of 
politics is closest to reality in Russia? (A. 
Politics is a method of producing legal orders and directions 
for society; B. Politics is the struggle for power 
and competition among individuals and groups in the distribution 
of rewards and benefits within society; C. Politics 
is the art of living together, the art of unifying a large 
number of people.) 
  Results of the answers (A-0, B-30, C-3) speak for 
themselves: the overwhelming majority of respondents perceive 
politics not as socially useful management, but solely as 
an arena of struggle for power and access to "the state feeding 
trough." There is no need to demonstrate that in Russia, 
where property and power continue to be intertwined with each 
other, this is really the predominant aspect of politics. 
  Question: Which of the three statements impresses 
you the most? (A. When the authorities become 
involved in economics, it is bad; B. Any state 
intervention in economic life is useful to the extent that its 
harm is recognized; C. The state's regulatory 
intervention in the economy is a necessary condition for its 
balanced development.) 
  Results of the answers (A-4, B-7, C-22) reflect 
the realization that a market economy cannot exist in 
Russia without the appropriate state support. Removal of 
the state from this sphere entirely is no more than social 
utopia. 
  Question: Is the solution of most of the problems 
related to the public's survival a priority function of the 
state? (A. Unquestionably; B. To a certain 
extent; C. No.) 
  Results of the answers (A-6, B-23, C-3, and 
undecided-1) indicate the predominance of those who 
advocate a socially oriented model for the market, within 
the framework of which the state provides for a certain 
guaranteed level at which the public's needs are met for the 
services of public health, education, housing, and so forth and 
provides for social protection of the poor and unfortunate. 
  Question: What obligations with respect to 
business should be assumed by the Russian State, in your opinion? 
  The answers received make it possible to establish three 
basic groups of such commitments: 
  --provision for the personal safety of entrepreneurs and 
protection from mafia structures, racketeering, and extortion by 
officials; 
  --reasonable taxation which stimulates entrepreneurial 
activity; and 
  --legal support for entrepreneurial activity and improvement 
and strict observance of the laws. 
  Question: Do you agree with the statement "A free 
market has many advantages, but they do not include fairness" 
(AFL-CIO President L. Kirkland)? (A.I fully agree; 
B. I agree in part; C. I do not agree.) 
  Results of the answers (A-9, B-19, C-4, and 
undecided-1) indicate that the majority of respondents are not 
afflicted with the "market romanticism" syndrome (such as:"give 
complete freedom to business, and order and fairness will be 
established automatically in society"). Most of the 
respondents realize that entreprenuerial activity needs a 
definite system of checks and restrictions (primarily 
legal), so that those with economic power do not cross over the 
line beyond which private interest conflicts with the public 
interest. 
  Question: Define the ideological orientation of 
the author of the following quotation: "The task of an 
enterprise is to produce for consumption, not for easy profit or 
speculation. Speculation with finished products has nothing in 
common with business--it is mo more and no less than an 
acceptable form of stealing" (H. Ford, Sr.) (This was stated by 
A. a communist; B. a social-democrat; 
C. a liberal-conservative.) 
  Results of the answers (A-21, B-5, C-6, and 
undecided-1) show that most of the respondents have a hazy 
idea of the functional role of business (production and the 
supply of socially useful goods and services) and its 
moral and value principles and imperatives. 
  Question: Name the principal difficulties you are 
encountering in your entrepreneurial activity. 
  The spectrum of problems identified (aside from those 
indicated in the answers to Question No. 4) is as follows: 
  --nonfulfillment of contract commitments and dishonorable 
conduct by partners; 
  --lack of support in the organs of executive authority and 
their corruption; 
  --bureaucratism and amateurishness of officials; 
  --poor information support (especially with respect to 
demand 
and competition); 
  --political instability and the unpredictability of politics 
and the absence of a clearly defined government policy; 
  --inflation and the instability of the dollar; 
  --the lack of funds and essential contacts; 
  --the lack of practical skills and the ability to work with 
people; and 
  --the lack of knowledge and other factors. 
  Question: Which one of the following 10 political 
figures would you give preference to: (B. Yeltsin, V. 
Zhirinovskiy, V. Chernomyrdin, N. Travkin, Ye. Gaydar, K. 
Borovoy, S. Shakhray, A. Sobchak, G. Yavlinskiy, G. Zyuganov)? 
  Results of the answers (9 for G. Yavlinskiy, 4 
each for Ye. Gaydar and B. Yeltsin, 2 each for S. Shakray and A. 
Sobchak, 1 each for K. Borovoy, V. Chernomyrdin, and N. Travkin, 
and 9 undecided) enable us to conclude that leading 
Russian politicians, with the possible exception of G. 
Yavlinskiy, do not inspire particular confidence from the 
respondents. This distribution reflects the need for new 
faces to make their appearance on the Russian political scene. 
  Question: Who holds the real power in Russia at 
present, in your opinion? 
  Results of the answers enable us to conclude unequivocally 
that the overwhelming majority consider two forces to be 
the holders of real power--the shadowy mafia structures (25 
"for") and the bureaucratic machinery (21 "for"). Further, to a 
lesser degree: the VPK [military-production complex] (5 "for"), 
the president and major financial-commercial corporations (4 
each), the government (3), and the SMI [mass information media] 
(2). If it is taken into account that nine-tenths of the private 
enterprises in Russia today are under the influence of organized 
crime to one degree or another, it is apparent that the 
respondents are not so far from the truth. 
  Question: Which of the following personality types 
best describes your attitude toward politics? A. an 
apolitical citizen; (B. a passive citizen; 
C. a competent critic; D. a competent 
observer; E. an activist.) 
  Results of the answers (A-5, B-9, C-8, D-11, E-1) 
lead to the conclusion that practically all the 
respondents dissociate themselves from politics. Meanwhile, 
the position "I do not want to be involved in politics, I want 
to engage only in business" is inadequate in the current 
situation in Russia, when the formation of a market economy 
depends mainly and fundamentally on policy and who is directing 
this policy. The right "to be outside of politics" has really 
been earned and provided for only by the developed market 
democracies. But for us, in light of what has been stated above, 
this is an impermissible luxury, especially for those who seek 
to become the masters of their destiny and do not want to depend 
on the "mercies" of the state. 
  Question: What is the principal reason for 
Russia's current problems, in your opinion? (A. those 
in power are not professionals; B. professionals are 
in power, but they are constantly interfered with; C. 
both.) 
  Results of the answers (A-2, B-2, C-26, 
undecided-3) enable us to draw this conclusion: at the level of 
the structural and functional organization of state authority, 
the overwhelming majority of respondents adequately 
reflect the subjective reasons for the processes of crisis in 
Russia. On one hand, the country is really suffering from 
the lack of professionalism and incompetence, a lack of 
responsibility and actions "on the off-chance" peculiar to many 
"new" politicians who came to power on the wave of 
democratization and who are learning the art of state 
administration "on the job." On the other hand, the intense 
opposition to changes from the numerous "holders" and "managers" 
of state property, those who have "privatized" the state 
authority of the nomenklatura and bureaucratic circles, the 
mafia structures, and others is having an effect. 
  Question: If new elections to the State Duma were 
held today, which parties and voting blocs would you vote for? 
  Results of the answers: 6 each for "Russia's 
Choice" and "Yabloko," 4 for the RDDR [Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms], 2 for the PES [Economic Freedom Party], 1 
each for the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], DPR 
[Democratic Party of Russia], and "Women of Russia," and 12 
undecided. We may speak of the "lack of party affiliation" 
in the political consciousness of most of the respondents 
and their "vote of no confidence" in the parties and blocs which 
are actually taking part in the exercise of political power in 
Russia today. 
<H5>  General Conclusions </H5>
  We are dealing with representatives of the class of Russian 
entrepreneurs which is being "born in torment" (taking into 
account that this is not a very favorable environment, and, in 
places, one that is even openly hostile), and one that has been 
formed only as "a class in itself" at present. The overwhelming 
majority of respondents are "standing firmly on their own feet," 
that is, they view life quite realistically (without romanticism 
and illusions) and perceive it most often as it actually exists. 
The majority distinctly acknowledge their own special interests 
and the numerous problems facing private enterprise activity in 
Russia. The obligations which the state should assume toward 
business are also expressed very specifically. However, as 
far as the public obligations and value imperatives of business 
itself are concerned, there is a certain "flabbiness" and 
"haziness" here. 
  The respondents' perception of the state as an institution 
which "has an obligation to business because of its position" 
(as well as of such specific holders of political power as 
parties and their leaders) is more negative than positive. 
Social criticism and skepticism predominate. At the 
same time, we do not see a sufficient amount of awareness that a 
state "obligated to business because of its position" (with the 
present distribution of political forces) will turn to this by 
itself, and that it must be constantly pushed in this direction, 
and even "forced" to do so. The economic power concentrated in 
entrepreneurial circles should be turned into a political 
resource for "power" pressure on the state and its structures 
and "incentive" for them to take part in a business partnership 
with equal rights. Both from without (through a developed 
political infrastructure of parties, public associations, and so 
forth) and from within (through direct "assumption of authority 
by individual entrepreneurs" and by putting "their own people" 
in parliament and other representative organs, and so forth). 
And this in turn assumes a target-oriented investment of capital 
and development of the special field of free enterprise and 
political business, with broad participation by specialist 
professionals (economists, sociologists, political scientists, 
jurists, and so forth).

<F P=106> [Article by A. Degtyarev: "Three Misfortunes in Russia: </F>
Fools, Roads, and Taxes"] 
  [Text] The chief misfortunes in present-day Russia 
are three: fools, roads, and taxes. Taxes, moreover, are looked 
on as a misfortune not only by the economy, which has been 
assessed to the max, but also by the government, which has been 
utterly unable to collect them and so keeps coming up with new 
ones. 
  The three misfortunes seem primordially given us. Let us 
turn, for example, to the era of Ivan the Terrible, since just 
like our blessed perestroyka, it developed smoothly into a great 
Time of Troubles. 
  Over the third quarter of the sixteenth century, sovereign 
assessments increased by a factor of 10. The peasantry answered 
this increase with a massive curtailment of taxable 
landholdings, moves, and wholesale flight to the south--to the 
frontier. The government parried the popular challenge with 
edicts on enserfment and a new increase in collections. By the 
beginning of the seventeenth century, the situation had become 
absurd. A landholding that had been worked for half a century 
before by a single peasant now came to accommodate 150 
households. Not that each of them began to till less; the tilled 
fields simply became secret, and so not subject to the heavy 
tsarist assessment. To put it in modern terms, the economy 
became substantially a shadow economy. As a result, many fewer 
taxes now reached the treasury. And the government, in the 
person of the expanded departmental apparatus, never tired of 
devising more and more new assessments. All kinds of money was 
collected: from the Strelets special military corps, from 
colonists, from town dwellers, from convicts, gross taxes, road 
taxes, and so on and so forth. 
  The state just couldn't get rich, though! Because collecting 
taxes from a shadow economy, as we well know today, is 
impossible in principle. At the time the clerks of the Boyars 
Council, the glorious Gaydars of those times long past, decided 
to replace the land tax with a household tax. The unexpected 
result was not an increase in taxes collected but a sharp 
increase in household size. Within a few years there were 20-30 
huts behind a single gate, with tens of families living in each 
hut. But it was a single household! The same taxes were paid as 
on a single household. 
  The keen struggle between state and subjects continued for a 
hundred years--until the Great Transformer introduced the per 
capita tax, which functions in the form of an income tax even 
now. 
  However, it is not enough to introduce a tax. You have to 
know how to collect it. The methods Petr I used to collect them 
in our homeland are remembered to this day. One way or another, 
though, taxes began to flow into the treasury, and the state was 
even able to carry out a few investment programs--for instance, 
to build our nation's supremely powerful navy, whose three 
hundredth anniversary we are about to celebrate. 
  The current rulers are a long way from achieving an 
effectiveness of tax policy on Petr's level. They seem to be 
somewhere in the early seventeenth century, for their actions 
(like taxpayers' answering measures) are stunningly reminiscent 
of the situation sketched out above. 
  The situation that arose around the drafting and approval of 
the 1994 budget convinces us without a doubt that the mentality 
of the present-day Russian government has not advanced very far 
from the experience of previous centuries. I will cite merely 
the latest observation of parliament economic figures, published 
last Thursday in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. The tax burden is 
increasing notably, they state gloomily, after studying the 
draft budget. The profit tax has been increased to 6 percent, a 
3-percent "special tax" has been introduced, property tax has 
been raised to 2 percent, a 1-percent transportation tax has 
been introduced, and duties have been raised on imports. 
  But to promulgate an edict about raising taxes is by no 
means 
the same as increasing the income to the budget. The same 
parliamentary authors state with a heavy sigh that even with an 
increase in the total tax burden, the government is too weak to 
pass specific and real measures to increase the income to the 
budget. Or, to speak in ordinary language, they don't have what 
it takes to collect the taxes. They write up a resolution 
increasing them with one hand, and with the other pass out (or 
cannot cancel) various tax privileges, "tax breaks" for giant 
bankrupts, and so on. Finally, the state lacks effective means 
for influencing the shadow economy with the goal of its speedy 
emergence under the bright spotlight of the tax department. 
  Collecting taxes even close to in full is a task that is far 
from resolved. The gloomiest skeptic-observers say that only 
10-20 percent of taxes are actually collected. The rest--by 
various legal but primarily illegal methods--are hidden from the 
state. In other words, the greater part of the contemporary 
economy is essentially a shadow economy, that is, concealed from 
the state. Let me emphasize that we are not talking about the 
criminal economy--the drug business, or traffic in arms or 
children. We are talking about the Snickers trade and the 
production of stockings, about unregistered transportation, 
unreported services, and the uncontrolled traffic in securities. 
For a year and a half, for example, a voucher bacchanalia has 
been raging in the country; 150 million vouchers have changed 
hands several times each already. The count of operations with 
these securities is going into the several billions, but what 
profit has the treasury gained from this traffic? A big 
fat--nothing. 
  And so it goes in any sphere of economic life you like. 
Compare two figures. Over the last three years, production has 
been cut by a half, and energy consumption only by 13 percent. 
How is this paradox to be interpreted? In my opinion, it speaks 
to the fact that at least one-fourth of production has gone into 
the economic "shadow," hidden away from state statistics and tax 
assessment. 
  This is the problem to end all problems. But cabinet members 
and the gigantic apparatus of the executive power are involved 
in everything--the creation of political parties, trips to 
international fora, excursions to halted factories, fruitless 
clashing with deputies and journalists--except the main thing 
they are up against: the provision of vital activity to the 
state organism, which is impossible without an efficient system 
for tax collection. There isn't one today. And the paralysis of 
the state budget everyone has observed is engendered not by 
disagreements over the size of its articles. The matter is both 
simpler and more tragic. That which the authorities have been 
able to collect from subjects in principle cannot be enough even 
for the most essential state expenditures, to say nothing of 
investments in forward-looking branches, subsidy support, and so 
on. 
  It cannot be said that nothing is being done about creating 
a 
system for collecting taxes. No, money is going to this and is 
being spent successfully by numerous budgetary mouths. Lobbying 
groups are attempting with varying degrees of success to pull 
strings for their foreign developers--some for Americans, some 
for Taiwanese, some for Siemens, some for somebody else. As 
usually happens in Russia, the authorities as yet have paid no 
attention to our own prophets, which, as always happens in 
Russia, we have. Well known, for example, is the so-called 
Kemerov Task, a program that can help increase significantly the 
efficiency of mid-level tax departments. Promised developments 
connected with the problem of coordinating tax and investment 
policy have been carried out at the initiative of the State 
Committee for Industrial Policy. 
  However, one of the most effective automated information 
systems for a territorial-level tax service has been developed 
not with state money but in the private sector. About five years 
ago, a group of economists, graduates of TsEMI, other 
institutes, and state structures, joining together into the 
Bureau of Information Technologies, addressed the problem of 
resolving this task given the special prose of Russian economic 
life. Today a system has been created with the Bureau's funds 
and introduced in several tax inspectorates. The developers were 
counting on their product finding a relatively quick demand, 
given the market reforms, and the costs being paid off. So far 
this hasn't happened, and when it will is unclear; in the 
Russian market its own special laws are operative. 
  The Sprut [Octopus] system that the Bureau people worked out 
truly does correspond to its name. According to the testimony of 
the head of the Moscow Thirtieth State Tax Inspectorate, L. N. 
Grin, introduction of the system made it possible to increase 
additional payments to the budget by a factor of eight in a 
single quarter. 
  It takes only a few months to pay off the costs of 
introducing Sprut, and for a few tasks--for example, exaction of 
fines--just two or three weeks. 
  For those who are looking for a tax-collecting body 
overseas, 
let me cite the testimony of a foreign authority, the kind 
people so love to cite nowadays. Specialists from the U.S. 
federal tax department, under the leadership of the director of 
the tax service's programming department, F. Konrad, having 
acquainted themselves with Sprut, gave the following written 
testimony: "The computer program shown to us is well elaborated, 
and we think that it is a solid basis for further work." The 
conclusion is dry enough, of course, and short on ecstasy, but 
it was made by people who know how to collect taxes like no one 
else in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Lyubov Volkova: "That Means Someone Needs It: On </F>
Diamonds in the Voucher Check Caves Once Again"] 
  [Text] On 5 November 1993, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA [RG] 
printed a perfectly harmless article entitled "Do Not Count 
Diamonds in the Voucher Check Caves," where specialists 
questioned the sincerity of advertisements of the check 
investment fund "Neft-Almaz-Invest" [Oil-Diamond-Invest]. As it 
became clear, however, the claim hit a sore spot, and the fund's 
managers proposed that the editorial office publish a retraction 
and compensate for moral damages with a monetary sum of 50 
million rubles [R], and in addition threatened to sue the 
newspaper. 
  And although instead of money and a retraction, they 
received 
an even more expositary article entitled "Ship the Diamonds in 
Barrels" (RG, 22 December 1993), for some reason they did not 
sue the newspaper. 
  As it turned out, state offices had begun auditing the fund. 
As a result, the fund's license was revoked and criminal 
proceedings were instituted against its management. 
  But several days ago events took an altogether different 
turn. On 11 April, the finding of the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly Commission of Independent Experts on 
the audit of the activity of the "Neft-Almaz-Invest" check 
investment fund, the "Dante-Capital Management Company" and 
"Depositariya" [Depositary] was faxed to the editorial office. 
The first lines of the finding confirmed that the high 
Commission (with a capital letter) had been created at the 
instruction of the leadership of the State Duma Committee on 
Ownership, Privatization, and Economic Activity. And then over 
several pages came a complex denial of any violations by the 
fund. That was the Commission's finding. The fund works in 
accordance with Russia's laws and its charter and it operates 
efficiently. The fact of 572,700 missing privatization checks 
was not established. 
  The Commission considers incorrect the claim of the GKI 
[State Investment Committee] employees that the 
"Neft-Almaz-Invest" ChIF [check investment fund] illegally 
issued and sold stock worth R11 billion. It also does not 
recognize the claim that the fund does not follow established 
procedures in keeping a stockholders' register and thereby does 
not protect stockholders' rights properly. 
  The Commission believes that the GKI and the law enforcement 
organs have done serious damage to the cause of privatization in 
Russia, which should also be reimbursed by them following 
established procedures. 
  Yes, RG rightly wrote, the bosses of investment funds easily 
imagined that a Soviet citizen would take any word spoken on 
television and in the press as the absolute truth. Despite the 
exposes in our newspaper, they were earnestly counting on 
catching even us journalists through our gullibility and using 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to influence the minds and feelings of 
Russians. In the Commission's opinion, journalists should have 
"saluted" and printed the finding after looking at the list of 
members of the Commission: 
  "V. M. Simcher, academician, doctor of economic sciences, 
and 
chairman of the Commission; V. S. Martemyanov, State Duma 
deputy; Yu. M. Ruda, State Duma deputy; V. V. Grigoryev, expert, 
doctor of economic sciences, and docent; V. V. Ivanov, expert, 
candidate of economic sciences, and docent; A. V. Filippov, 
expert and department chief of the Control-Budget Committee 
under the State Duma; and A. K. Solodov, expert and auditor. A 
representative of the Procurator's Office of the city of Moscow, 
A. A. Bratchikov, and a representative of the RF Tax Policy 
Department Administration for the city of Moscow, Major A. P. 
Klishin, were enlisted for the Commission's work." 
  But we decided to call the chairman of the Committee on 
Ownership, Sergey Burkov, at the State Duma. And it turned out 
that in the Committee they first heard of the Commission from 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. Here is the text of the official 
announcement of the committee delivered specially for 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: 
  "The State Duma Committee on Ownership, Privatization, 
and Economic Activity states that the Committee did not make a 
decision to create a certain Commission To Study the Activity of 
the `Neft-Almaz-Invest' Fund. Moreover, this question was not 
discussed or even raised. If such a Commission was in fact 
created, the Committee did not authorize it to do the study. All 
the facts cited in this connection are only the opinion of 
certain deputies." 
  Why was this needed, and who needed it? Sergey Burkov 
answered this question with the conjecture that a serious 
political game is underway and large amounts of money have been 
used. He promised to inform our readers of the details in a few 
days when the circumstances of the matter are cleared up.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Baranovsky: "A Russian Bath for Dirty </F>
Rubles"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Laundering dirty money has traditionally been one of 
the most "intellectual" and highly paid trades in the West's 
underworld. The masters of financial intrigues have to turn 
themselves inside out, inventing intricate operations to pass 
dirty dollars, lire or yen through innumerable banking filters 
and get a 100-percent clean product. In our country, however, 
there is no need to make any great effort to achieve this -- the 
circulation of criminal money has been almost legalized and, 
were it not for several nuances, it would be absolutely 
pointless to discuss the techniques of laundering dirty capital 
in Russia. 
<H5>  Fearless billions </H5>
  The sources from which dirty money originate are the same 
throughout the world -- narcobusiness, illegal trade in arms and 
antiques, and prostitution. In the opinion of experts, in 
present-day Russia, in contrast to the West, there is no need to 
clean the money gained from these operations -- without any 
treatment it can be safely used in legal turnover. There are 
hundreds of variants: transferring money from one bank account 
to another, lending or loaning, purchasing realty, investing in 
a business. In none of these cases is the mafia, as are 
individual law-unabiding citizens, threatened with an unpleasant 
question from a financial inspector -- "where's the money from?" 
  During the past year not a single person in Moscow has been 
condemned for concealing incomes or for evading the submission 
of a declaration on money receipts, although it is perfectly 
well known to everyone that fantastic sums are not taxed in 
Russia today. Last year Moscow's taxation police checked a mere 
236 of the tens of thousands of commercial and state 
organizations. It also checked 423 individuals. This kind of 
"activity" means just one thing -- no serious control over the 
movement of money has been established in Russia. This means, at 
least, that no one is interested in the origin of capital in our 
country. But does it also mean that there are no problems with 
laundering money? 
  "Russian criminals still have to `rub' their money," says 
Mikhail Zotov, section head at the Investigation Department of 
Moscow's Main Directorate of Internal Affairs. "This is true 
only in cases when money is earned through large-scale crimes 
which, incidentally, seldom occur in the West. The real issue is 
`air money' -- the billions and trillions that are removed from 
bank accounts on forged documents." 
  Indeed, criminals have to invent new miraculous ways to 
convert this money into cash and to cover their tracks. 
<H5>  Playing hide-and-seek </H5>
  Domestic mafiosi got their first serious experience in 
laundering money when they used false letters of advice in 
1992-1993. To this day this episode has remained the biggest 
"emergency" in the entire history of the existence of Russia's 
financial and credit system. Upwards of 1.5 trillion (!) rubles 
were stolen from the state with forged documents. Public money 
was involved and therefore definite efforts were required to 
take the stolen money away from under the nose of 
law-enforcement bodies and then to clean it. The criminals 
succeeded with flying colors. 
  "The scheme of laundering stolen money is always typical," 
says Mikhail Zotov. "Some commercial structure sets up a 
peculiar buffer zone for itself -- a group of fictitious firms 
allegedly having no relation to it, although in fact they are 
its subsidiaries. Moreover, they may be scattered all over the 
country. Then, of course, the commercial structure opens 
accounts for all of them at different banks. Now it is already 
possible to manage serious illegal operations. 
  "For instance, the mother firm concludes a fake contract 
with 
its own dummy structure in a different city, say, for the 
delivery of farm produce. Immediately it puts through the 
banking network a false letter of advice -- the non-existent 
payment for the specific commodity. By way of multistage 
machinations the real money is entered on the head 
organization's account. That is all -- dirty money has been 
received. Now comes the laundering: the mother firm 
instantaneously transfers the money stolen from the state to the 
bank account of yet another one of its fictitious subsidiary 
organizations, again with a fake contract -- allegedly for the 
purchase of specific products. On the face of it everything is 
in accordance with the law. Over there, the received rubles are 
turned into cash and laundered, whereupon the false firm is 
liquidated and the stolen money disappears without a trace. In 
fact, now the fraudulently earned capital is fully controlled by 
the organizers of the multistage swindle. This is all -- the 
circle has been closed. Where the stolen billions will surface 
is another matter. In any case, nobody will ask where the money 
came from -- it is quite suitable for legal financial-economic 
operations. "It is practically impossible for law-enforcement 
bodies to find the culprits. 
  But though the financial and credit system is a common area 
where criminals launder money, it is not the only way, of course. 
<H5>  Medellin cartel respects Russia </H5>
  The casino is perhaps one of the most traditional 
"laundries" 
for washing dirty capital in the West. Without any doubt, 
domestic gambling institutions are also used for these purposes. 
All the more so since according to the militia's summaries, more 
than half of them (and there are about a hundred of them in 
Moscow) are controlled by criminal structures. The system of 
laundering is simple: dirty money is passed through the casino 
as winnings. And since our New Russians are hot-tempered, 
reckless and, moreover, rich people -- it is possible to declare 
daily very large sums on financial reports. And there is one 
more interesting peculiarity: gambling houses have a lot of 
foreign capital. This makes it possible for criminals to clean 
their pounds, dollars and marks, which then safely return home 
as the large sum snatched in an "honest" game with the Russians. 
  In general, laundering money through transnational mafia 
syndicates is prevalent on the Russian market. One need not have 
a rich imagination to presume that not one billion of "narco 
dollars" are hidden in Russia's troubled waters. But, strange as 
it may be, neither the Federal Counterintelligence Service nor 
the Interior Ministry has specific data on these operations. 
  The international mafia can launder money in different ways 
in our country. For instance, through its Russian colleagues or 
its own legalized structure it may invest its unclean money in 
the purchase of timber, oil and metals. Then the commodity is 
shipped to the West (generally through our near abroad) where it 
is sold and clean dollars appear on someone's account in a Swiss 
bank. It is very difficult to find faults with these savings -- 
the money seems to have been earned as a result of an honest 
commercial deal. 
  One more variant of laundering is the investment of money 
through dummy firms in Russia in lucrative financial and 
industrial projects. And, of course, the acquisition of real 
estate, land, enterprises and banks. The range of maneuver is 
great and, moreover, I repeat, nobody in Russia takes any 
interest in the origin of capital. So it will hardly be a 
surprise when with time the shadows of Camorra, Yakuza or the 
Medellin cartel become apparent behind many of our industrial 
and financial giants. 
<H5>  Offices for exchange of criminal experience </H5>
  And lastly, active use is being made in today's Russia of 
the 
numerous currency exchange offices for laundering operations 
with cash in rubles and foreign exchange. Already the fact that 
not a single exchange office, not even the Central Bank, knows 
even their approximate number makes one wonder. Although, 
according to strict instructions, every authorized bank must 
present exhaustive information on all its exchange offices to 
the territorial departments of the Central Bank. 
  "Of course, almost nobody does that -- it is not profitable: 
there will be check-ups, inspections and reports," says Alexei 
Belov, deputy head of the 4th section of the Moscow Criminal 
Investigation Department. "Therefore we decided to take a look 
ourselves: how many exchange offices are there in Moscow? In the 
course of our operation we checked about 1,000 such centers. In 
fact, I believe, there are many more in the capital -- at least 
2,000-2,500. The Social Development Bank alone had about 400 
exchange offices until recently." 
  The results of our investigation were stunning. No more than 
a dozen exchange offices in Moscow worked without violating 
instructions and legislation. In 61 banks there were no orders 
in opening exchange offices, practically none of the offices 
filled out Form No. 377 which requires that they record all 
exchange operations. A record number of violations was 
registered at the centers of the All-Russia Exchange Bank, 
Kristall Bank and First Investment Bank. 
  "It is evidently not worth explaining in detail why this 
happens," Belov goes on. "Going around in those banks is a vast 
quantity of uncounted cash, quite often of absolutely unknown 
origin. Rarely is it possible to understand where the office got 
the dollars which it sells for rubles or the rubles with which 
it buys dollars -- there are no accounts whatsoever. That is, 
any money you like -- whether stolen from the state, amassed 
through rackets or received on a fictitious payment -- may be 
and is put into circulation. 
<H5>  Fifth column </H5>
  Needless to say, it is not thanks to phenomenal intellect 
that our local mafiosi and their foreign colleagues have scored 
such impressive results in laundering money. At every stage of 
implementing their criminal plants they have been actively 
assisted by the multimillion army of Russian officials, perhaps 
the most resourceful in the world. 
  Take the false letters of advice. According to most of the 
Interior Ministry's experts, the banks through which fictitious 
papers passed have, to one extent or another, taken part in this 
swindle. Of course, this statement seems too categorical but, on 
the other hand, it is not so groundless. For example, the 
investigation has shown that the Soyuzprombank made its own 
letters of advice. A criminal case has been brought up on this 
fact. Or one more case: in 1992 four false letters of advice to 
the sum of 2.2 billion rubles were received at the address of a 
client of the Moscow subsidiary of the Severny Bank run by the 
Zhilremontstroi firm from the small enterprise Svim in Grozny. 
The bank did not demand a contract with Svim, but remitted this 
money in small batches to the accounts of over 20 commercial 
enterprises indicated by the client. Whereupon the director of 
Zhilremontstroi vanished without a trace, whereas no Svim could 
be found in Chechnya, of course. However, in the course of a 
subsequent investigation eight million rubles of the stolen sum 
were found on the account of the Sirius firm, on whose payroll 
was Alan Gabisov, the chief accountant of the Moscow subsidiary 
of the Severny Bank. Another 1.5 million was found on the 
account of the Alan enterprise, one of whose founders was 
Gabisov's father, and another 31 million -- in the firm of the 
chief accountant's childhood friend. 
  There have been at least dozens of such scandals. 
  There is one more problem conducive to the success of 
swindlers -- the absence of a normal data bank on likely 
business partners: commercial banks, firms and natural persons. 
Moreover, no track is kept in Russia of stolen and lost 
passports, and registration chambers, even in Moscow, have not 
yet been computerized. Hence the thousands of fictitious firms 
which exist solely on paper and through which the underworld 
launders its money. It is more than easy to start such a fake 
enterprise. You find, steal or buy a passport from some hobo, 
glue your photo on it and off you go to the registration 
chamber. You get registered there and immediately go to the bank 
to open an account. That's all: yet another fake office is born. 
  In short, conditions are very good for thieves in our 
country, one might even say extremely favorable, to such an 
extent that seditious thoughts occur form time to time -- for 
example, legislators are preoccupied solely with checking their 
projects with swindlers: so as not to harm them or not to cross 
their path. And until journalists get rid of these strange 
perceptions, they will for a long time continue lacking 
materials on financial-economic swindles and on the mafia's 
laundering operations. 
  MN [MOSCOW NEWS] file 
  Last year 110,000 economic crimes, 4,300 of them in the 
financial and credit system, were committed in Russia. According 
to the Central Bank's data, false payments are brought to light 
every quarter to the tune of 120 billion rubles. Exposed during 
this round were 429 criminal groups specializing in business and 
banking operations. The law-enforcement bodies averted the theft 
of sums which totalled two trillion rubles. 
  According to reports by French special services, in the 
first seven months of 1993 alone the commercial structures of 
the CIS countries and the Baltics earned 1,045 billion francs on 
the re-export of Russian raw materials to France -- 96 percent 
of these deliveries passed through Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania 
and Georgia. Of course, some of the illegally exported raw 
materials were intercepted -- 97.8 tons of oil products, 17.8 
tons of different grades of metal -- but that is nothing in 
comparison to the whole volume of materials. 
  According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as many 
as 1,500 officials violated the Russian president's decree on 
the fight against corruption in 1993. Of this number, 25.8 
percent were staff members of law-enforcement bodies, 42.7 
percent -- of ministries, different committees and their 
structures at grassroots level, 11.3 percent -- workers of the 
financial and credit system, 2.5 percent -- employees of the 
Customs Committee. Over the same period of time 4,500 persons 
were found to be taking bribes.

<F P=106> [Article by jurist Sergey Zamoshkin, under the rubric </F>
"Expert Opinion": "Crime Report: Reality or Myth?] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] has 
published a "Report to the Citizens of Russia" on its work over 
the year. It is a notable fact. But the real sensation is in the 
data it published on the state of crime. The report says 
proudly: "For the first time over the past five years, through 
the common efforts of state and regional structures, the growth 
of crime has been somewhat contained. In 1993 it increased by 
only 1.4 percent." One would think we should cheer such a 
progress. But somehow we are not happy. 
  Over the entire past year militia officers of all ranks, led 
by Minister Viktor Yerin, had been scaring us with tales of 
crime, quoting figures and facts, and saying that it was growing 
at a horrible rate. They also explained the causes: imperfect 
laws, insufficient powers of the MVD, loyalty to criminals, and 
so on. So what happened? Is it that we were being scared on 
purpose and now the deception has come out? More likely it is 
now that an attempt is being made to deceive us. Many jurists 
maintain that there has been no real improvement in the 
situation. 
  If one carefully reads the MVD report, it becomes clear that 
it contains far more significant data than the miserly 
percentage points of the total increase in crime. Judge for 
yourself. What kind of success are we talking about when grave 
offenses--those that really frighten everyone--have increased 
over the year by one-quarter? Premeditated murders are up by 27 
percent; grave bodily injury, by 24 percent; assaults, by 32 
percent; robberies, by 12 percent; incidents of hooliganism, by 
31 percent; and the increase in the registered incidence of 
swindling amounted to a whopping 140 percent. The overall 
decline is achieved mainly by "trifles." But the worst part is 
that crimes are not being solved. In one-half of the 
instances--which is 1,360,000 crimes--the culprits have not been 
found. 
  One more important point. Departmental statistics do not 
correspond to reality--they embellish it. A considerable number 
of crimes by different means are deliberately kept out of 
reporting by the militia. Many of those who have been victimized 
by criminals know that local militia precincts are reluctant to 
register citizens' claims. Under all sorts of pretexts the 
victims are persuaded not to file a claim or are forced to 
change the circumstances of the event. The purpose is simple--to 
avoid registering the crime. If they succeed, it immediately 
improves two indicators of militia work: reports on crime and 
reports on solving crimes. For the sake of good indicators, 
criminal proceedings are not initiated, investigations are not 
conducted, nobody looks for criminals, and they continue with 
impunity, committing new crimes. The situation with respect to 
car theft is indicative. According to the MVD report, over the 
past year there have been 60,415 -- 3,067 fewer than in 1992. 
Who will really believe that fewer cars get stolen? The 
explanation is quite different: Not all victims' claims are 
registered by militia. 
  It is impossible to develop reasonably effective measures 
for 
combating crime when we have reports that so clearly contradict 
real life: It is hard to cure a disease when one does not know 
the diagnosis. But our militia commanders want so much to look 
good in the eyes of their superiors. As a result, while 
admitting in the report that crime is a social phenomenon, and 
that problems are growing, the MVD nevertheless promises to 
somewhat "restrain" crime. The MVD is willing to admit its "own 
shortcomings and considerable reserves to increase the efforts," 
but insists that their department still "is a steadily 
functioning state structure capable of mobilizing and 
effectively carrying out the tasks set for it. Attempts of some 
political forces to weaken it and compromise it have been 
unsuccessful." With such conclusions, it is hard to count on 
truthfulness in MVD reports on its activities. Because any 
criticism of the agency may be labeled a subversive action. 
  Of course, from time to time manipulations involving 
failures 
to register crimes come into the open. Sometimes it happens 
because citizens complain; more often, as a result of procuracy 
audits. Last year, for instance, the Procuracy registered more 
than 40,000 crimes unregistered by militia--almost five percent 
more than in 1992. It is impossible, however, to place a 
procurator to look over every militiaman's shoulder. Besides, 
what can the auditors do considering that their bosses, too, 
demand that crime be "reduced?" 
  What to do? At this point, probably the only solution is in 
a 
more active position of local authorities. To a great extent, 
the material and technical equipment of militia and personnel 
matters are in their hands. The national crime suppression 
program is useful, of course, but it will not be a panacea--the 
main burden will still remain on the shoulders of local budgets. 
So why pay for fake crime reports when people are afraid to 
leave the house at night?

<F P=106> [INFORM-KURANTY report: "Do `Godfathers' Own the City?"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Government is still readying the 
law on protection of all persons--from investigators to 
witnesses--aiding in the criminal justice process. It is long 
overdue, because fear of retaliation keeps those who know 
something quiet. The latest victim of contract murder was 
sportsman, businessman, and philanthropist Otari Kvantrishvili, 
who was killed by a sniper. Shots from hired guns sound 
increasingly often on the streets of the capital. And with 
impunity. Is it really true that `GODFATHERS' OWN THE CITY? 
  Moscow was shocked and intrigued by the latest, clearly 
contract murder. An unidentified sniper fired several shots and 
killed O. Kvantrishvili, a controversial personality about whom 
there had been a great variety of opinions while he was still 
alive. For some, Kvantrishvili was a famous philanthropist, who 
kept out of poverty many previously famous athletes and a 
well-known coach, and one of the founders of the Lev Yashin 
Foundation for Social Protection of Athletes and of the 
sportsmen party. In the opinion of others, behind Kvantrishvili 
was a trail of questionable connections, which in the final 
count led to his sad demise. Anyway, let us wait and see what 
conclusions the investigation will reach. Meanwhile let us try 
to reconstruct some events that preceded the tragedy. 
<H5>  Nine Months Before the Murder </H5>
  In the beginning of August of last year, O. Kvantrishvili's 
brother Amiran--an "exposed" kingpin in the Moscow criminal 
world--was killed in a classic mafiosi score-settling. The 
shooting, which took the life of Amiran and his people, happened 
right in front of a commercial company on Yakimanka. Crime 
kingpins (many did not make any particular effort to hide on 
that day) held a posh funeral for A. Kvantrishvili in the style 
of criminal novels. A burial service was performed in the 
Vagankovskoye cemetery church, and he was buried right there, 
next to the grave of... Vladimir Vysotskiy. Many recalled then 
that several years before Amiran's funeral another kingpin from 
the Caucasus--Valerian Kuchuloria--was buried at this 
prestigious Moscow cemetery. 
  In the evening, in the Hotel Moscow restaurant, the deceased 
was remembered, noisily and with pomp. Among the invited guests 
were quite a few famous Moscow personalities with whom the crime 
boss was friendly. The only person who did not attend the wake, 
according to some sources, was one of the chiefs of the Dagestan 
mafia, S. Lukmanov, who was supposed to be in hiding from the 
authorities and very carelessly "exposed" himself at the 
cemetery. 
  A little later many mass media also began mentioning direct 
connections with the criminal world of the other Kvantrishvili 
brother--Otari. Members of the law enforcement community in 
confidential conversations advanced guesses regarding his weight 
in the criminal world. There were also questions regarding the 
Yashin Foundation, which to some looked like a convenient cover 
for money-laundering. 
  Meanwhile, Otari Kvantrishvili continued, with visible 
pleasure, to attend society mingling parties and to "shine" on 
television. 
<H5>  Two Days Before... </H5>
  Nikita Simonyan, first vice president of the Russian Soccer 
Union, was one of the last persons to see Kvantrishvili alive: 
  "It just so happened that I saw Otari Vitalyevich literally 
a 
couple of days before this. He felt fine, was in a good mood. 
Together, we had a conversation with Russian Hockey Federation 
[RHF] President Vladimir Petrov. We talked about the conflict 
between the RHF and the leadership of a number of clubs in the 
International Hockey League. By the way, Otari Vitalyevich was 
always very interested in the problems of our sport and, being 
the president of the Yashin Foundation, gladly helped 
impoverished athletes and the disabled. Most of all, however, he 
rooted as a fan of Moscow Dynamo. Very often I saw him in the 
bleachers at the stadium." 
  INFORMATION: As our correspondent was told by the 
Sports Wrestling Federation, Otari Vitalyevich has done 
free-style wrestling for quite some time. He has not earned any 
particular laurels in this endeavor, however, and has never been 
a member of the USSR national team. He did find success as a 
coach. One of his disciples--Yuriy Vorobyev--even rose as high 
as two-time European champion. Later Kvantrishvili was awarded 
the title "Distinguished Coach of Russia." 
<H5>  And the Shots Sounded </H5>
  From various sources, we have been able to reconstruct the 
picture of the murder. Otari Kvantrishvili left 
Krasnopresnenskiy bath house on Tuesday at 1730 in the company 
of friends. When he reached the parking lot, three shots 
sounded. One bullet hit him in the head, one, in the neck, and 
the third, in the chest. Kvantrishvili's companions immediately 
took the wounded man to the Botkin Hospital. But it was too 
late... Several minutes after being brought to intensive case 
unit, Otari died. 
  Militia personnel who arrived at the site of the incident 
established that the shots had been fired from the attic window 
of a corner building, No. 4 (No. 29 on Presnenskiy Bank), 
located next to the baths. The operatives found a German-made 
small-gauge rifle (5.6 mm gauge) with a telescope and magazine, 
and three spent cartridges. That the assailant was a 
professional the investigators have no doubt. It is quite 
possible that having received his "honorarium" the hired killer 
had already left Moscow, or had been immediately "removed" by 
his own customers in order to cover the tracks. 
  There are several versions of the cause of the killing. Some 
believe that Kvantrishvili was killed on order from the 
so-called Slavic mafia, which had been lately very actively 
"pushed" by Caucasians. It is possible that the killing is 
somehow linked with the recent--second--attempt on the life of 
one of the Moscow mafia kingpins going under the nickname 
Raspisnoy. Others believe that the three fateful shots are 
"greetings from Lubyanka," which decided to sow discord between 
two largest criminal groups so that in the fight among 
themselves they would eliminate as many of each other as 
possible and at the very least would not unite--the latter 
holding a threat of unforetold consequences for the city's 
safety. 
  There are also other versions, including some related to 
Kvantrishvili's "sports" activities. In particular, with the 
sportsmen's party, which the Ministry of Justice had been 
refusing to register for quite some time despite tremendous 
pressure brought. 
  Having visited the site of the incident yesterday morning, 
our correspondents did not find anyone from internal affairs 
organs: "Investigative work" on the site had been completed 
during the night. Neither could anything be learned from bath 
house employees who, as if on a prompt, totally clammed up. 
There were, however, several cars with bored "riders" in them. 
  INFORMATION: It is a known fact that Otari 
Kvantrishvili was a good acquaintance of Iosif Kobzon. 
Unfortunately, we were unable to find out the singer's reaction 
to the event: He is currently on tour in the United States. In 
the office of his company, Moskovit, we were told that Kobzon 
already had been informed of the tragedy, but no detailed 
information is available yet. 
  The Yashin Foundation for the Social Protection of Sportsmen 
distributed a list of the deceased's achievements: raising 
several athletes who earned high titles; founding the foundation 
itself; helping Great Patriotic War and Afghan war veterans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Valentinovich Kiselev, general </F>
designer of Russian Legal Informatization, by DELOVOY MIR 
correspondent Eduard Suvorov: "Success Is Ensured by Openness"] 
  [Text] An international conference on "Legal and 
Information Problems in Creating a Unified Economic Space for 
the CIS" will be held on 26 and 27 April 1994 at the Russian 
Federation President's State Legal Administration. The very fact 
that it is being held is important for the business and 
practical scientific contacts of jurists, scientists, 
economists, and representatives of the organs of state authority 
and administration and the public. The need for a dialogue on 
various important problems in creating laws and regulating 
collaboration in the field of legal information and 
informatization is obvious. The success of this dialogue gives 
all of us a chance at a better future. 
  Boris Valentinovich Kiselev, the general designer of 
Russian Legal Informatization, is our guest at the editorial 
staff today. Our correspondent Eduard Suvorov has a conversation 
with him. 
  [Kiselev] The conference is charged with resolving the 
problem of legal informatization. The need for this is dictated 
by the qualitative renewal of society and the formation and 
development of a market economy. Under these conditions, the 
formation of a unified legal and information space is being 
advanced to the forefront: for it, and only it, will be able to 
provide for the dissemination of legal information to all 
structures of society. 
  [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, doesn't it seem to you that 
it 
is somewhat late for the creative process of building up legal 
informatization? 
  [Kiselev] You are right, unfortunately. But this is not a 
spontaneous reaction to the situation that has taken shape, but 
objective-oriented and purposeful work that has been carefully 
reasoned. It should give us confidence in the quality of our 
knowledge, so that we may have a real opportunity to influence 
the course of social processes and work for a rapprochement of 
views and lasting harmony in society. 
  [Suvorov] In the concept of Russia's legal informatization 
confirmed by the Russian Federation President's edict of 18 June 
1993, it states that the state policy of the Russian Federation 
in shaping and utilizing legal information resources and meeting 
the country's requirements for social and economic development 
with these resources is implemented by taking into account the 
interests of the subjects of the Russian Federation, the trends 
of international cooperation in legal information science, and 
the real opportunities for the informatization industry under 
the conditions of a market economy. Can this be transferred to 
the CIS? 
  [Kiselev] There is increasing realization that reintegration 
of the unified economic space is essential. And this gives me 
the right to speak about taking into account the interests of 
CIS states in shaping and utilizing legal information resources. 
Especially as there is a critical shortage of even elementary 
legal information services today. This has a very harmful effect 
on the public sense of justice and law and order. And not only 
in Russia, but throughout the CIS as well. 
  [Suvorov] A natural question: how do we solve this problem? 
  [Kiselev] I think that the legal informatization of society, 
based on a twofold task--informatization of the legal field, on 
one hand, and provision for legislative regulation of legal 
relationships in the field of informatization, on the other 
hand--will contribute to this to a substantial degree. 
Legal informatization should be considered the process of 
creating the best possible conditions to fully meet the legal 
information requirements of state and public structures, 
enterprises, organizations, institutions, and citizens based on 
the efficient organization and use of information resources. 
  The task is extraordinarily complex. After all, to provide 
for the legal informatization of the Russian Federation alone we 
will have to build a national legal information system which 
covers all regions, organs of authority and administration, and 
law enforcement organs. 
  [Suvorov] But who will be involved in bringing all this 
about? 
  [Kiselev] The functions of head organization have been 
entrusted to the "Sistema" Scientific and Technical Center of 
Legal Information of the Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and Information. This agency possesses powerful 
scientific and technical potential, combined with developed 
telecommunications facilities, and it can provide for the 
construction of a national system of legal information based on 
the highest achievements of science and technology and the 
integration of existing service lines and communications which 
accompany the different legal information systems. 
  [Suvorov] There is no universal legal information system in 
Russia yet. Collections and card files of official documents, 
automated systems, and legal data banks are functioning in the 
higher organs of state authority and administration of the 
Russian Federation and the republics within Russia, and in 
ministries and departments. But they are not linked with each 
other at all and serve only their own departments. 
  [Kiselev] You are right. Nevertheless, systems which make it 
possible to store and process individual sections of legal 
information have already appeared in the programming products 
market. It is another matter that most of them are the product 
of enthusiasm by local groups of developers, and they all do not 
have official status. Moreover, although the laws and formal 
government documents being adopted are published in the 
periodical press and in special collections and bulletins, far 
from all of them are entered into the data bases of the legal 
packages being sold. Let us point out that normative documents 
are modified and supplemented periodically in connection with 
current legislation that is developed, so it is essential that 
they are always up to date. It is even more complicated to work 
with departmental documents, the documents of republics in the 
Russian Federation, and the documents of local organs of state 
authority and administration. Most of the latter are not even 
published. 
  But the information which may be accessed through existing 
information systems is often contradictory and very limited in 
its variety, quantitative indicators, and forms of presentation. 
A developed program of specific measures is needed at the 
federal level of administration; practical realization of the 
program in combination with the efforts of the republic and 
regional systems of executive authority will make it possible to 
accomplish the most important state task of providing legal 
information support for subjects of the Russian Federation. Such 
a program is under development. 
  [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, it seems to me that these 
problems are typical not only in the Russian Federation, but in 
all the CIS member states. Can the forthcoming international 
conference help in resolving them somehow? 
  [Kiselev] Yes, of course. It has been called upon to work 
out 
proposals, and I think it will be able to do so, to reinforce 
practical cooperation by CIS member states in the field of legal 
informatization and the creation of a unified economic space. 
Especially as the development of an effective legal and 
contracting basis for overall development and expansion of 
economic relationships among the CIS member states, based on 
realization of the Agreement on Establishment of an Economic 
Union, is one of the principal directions and the gaze and 
thoughts of politicians and jurists are fixed on it. We need to 
find qualitatively new forms of cooperation in the field of 
politics, economics, law, the social sphere, and defense in the 
interests of the historic relationships among the peoples of the 
CIS states. 
  In addition, it is very important to work out a mechanism 
for 
interaction of the states' legislation in effect in conformity 
with the recommendations being adopted by the Interparliamentary 
Assembly, for coordination of efforts and close interaction by 
the parliaments of CIS member states in legislative support for 
economic reforms, and for a coordinated policy in the 
international arena. This can by helped by the international 
conference as well. 
  [Suvorov] Let us return to the subject of building Russia's 
legal information system, especially as it will probably be 
serving as a guidepost for the CIS countries. 
  [Kiselev] I have already said that a key role in realizing 
Russia's legal informatization is being played by the "Sistema" 
Scientific and Technical Center. As the central hub for the 
legal information system, it creates, shapes, and maintains the 
currency of the data bank of legal information, it coordinates 
the development and introduction of information and 
telecommunications technologies within the framework of building 
a system of legal information, and it conducts work related to 
legal information support for users of the legal information 
system. The tasks of the "Sistema" NTTs [Scientific and 
Technical Center] include keeping copies of the standard data 
banks of legal information up to date, duplicating them for use 
in regional legal information hubs, and providing for the 
practical and methodical activity of the developers. We should 
be concerned with keeping records on and classifying the laws of 
the Russian Federation, the decrees of the Federal Duma 
(parliament) of the Russian Federation, the edicts and 
directives of the Russian Federation President, and decisions by 
the Council of Ministers and Government of the Russian 
Federation, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, 
the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and the Higher 
Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation, as well as the 
legal documents of CIS member states, foreign laws, and other 
essential information which is used to provide legal information 
support. 
  In addition, our functions include expert analysis and 
sampling of hardware and software solutions, taking into account 
the requirements of world standards, the preparation of 
practical recommendations on introduction of the latest 
information technologies, and the application of standardized 
model solutions and hardware and software. I will say further 
that the acquisition of legal information directly "from the 
pen" of legislators, which guarantees its complete reliability 
and currency, is fundamentally important for the "Sistema" NTTs. 
  [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, the effectiveness with which 
the legal information system functions depends to a substantial 
degree on the completeness and reliability of information and 
the regularity with which it is received not only from central, 
but regional sources. 
  [Kiselev] Exactly! For this reason, it is advisable to 
resolve this problem from two sides at the same time: from the 
center and from pivotal regional informatization zones, which 
are the base centers for regions' legal information and 
communications systems for the transit movement of data for 
regional systems. Such regional hubs will be entrusted with the 
main volume of work in providing legal information for a wide 
range of customers. 
  [Suvorov] Has an analysis been made of the information 
surveys and what kind of results have they provided? 
  [Kiselev] Yes, an analysis has been made, making it possible 
to single out the following types of output flows: inquiries 
about legislative and normative documents, thematic sets of 
legislative and normative documents, texts of legislative and 
nmormative documents, inquiries about cases under consideration, 
inquiries about citizens' appeals to law enforcement organs, 
statistical inquiries, inquiries about case proceedings, and so 
forth. But this analysis enables us to state that each 
department is provided with information based on its own 
understanding of what information systems are and what automated 
data processing systems are, and so forth. 
  Meanwhile, the formation of state information resources in 
the legal field presupposes orientation toward the creation of a 
common information space, and consequently, the basis for 
building up and improving unified information technology in the 
legal field should be the principle of integrated, coordinated 
development of all the elements in the system. This will make it 
possible to effectively resolve the problem of information 
interaction among state structures, which in turn will provide 
for increased efficiency and correctness of the decisions made 
to regulate the various areas of public life. 
  In conclusion, I want to say that we must not be slow to 
bring order to public relations in the field of legal 
information and informatization, and that there is a critical 
need to prepare draft laws making it possible to legally define 
the affirmation and protection of the right of information 
ownership, protection of the information itself, and the 
affirmation of guarantees of the right to information and the 
protection of citizens' rights. 
  In other words, an open and clear state policy is needed in 
the field of legal informatization.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "Russia's Poor: The </F>
Government Will Give to Everyone"] 
  [Text] The general agreement signed yesterday by the 
trade unions, employers, and the government attests to the fact 
that the Chernomyrdin cabinet, under the threat of an outburst 
of public dissatisfaction, is prepared to turn the system for 
minimal protection of the poor into a kind of social shock 
absorber, which even the wealthiest countries do not permit 
themselves to have. 
  The signing of this kind of document in countries with a 
traditionally strong orientation toward a mechanism for social 
protection financed through the budget (the Scandinavian 
countries, for example) becomes an event that is more 
significant than presentation of the country's budget. Though 
foreign documents similar to the Russian General Agreement are 
not considered every year, but are sometimes in force for 
decades--in Sweden, for example, relationships among employers, 
trade unions, and the government are defined by the 
(Saltshebaden) Agreement signed in 1938. 
  The specific nature of the Russian agreement was apparent in 
the content. At present, neither entrepreneurs nor the trade 
unions have sufficient influence (chiefly on each other), and 
for this reason they look upon the government not as an 
arbitrator in disputes, but the only force capable of meeting 
their demands. Based on the text of the agreement that was 
signed, the conclusion may be drawn that the government has 
consented to this role, since it essentially made no 
counterdemands. 
  This conclusion is confirmed by unofficial information that 
"the social lobby" has practically succeeded in breaking down 
Ministry of Finance opposition and in bringing about an increase 
in the minimum wage (it is now 14,620 rubles [R]). It is assumed 
that the president's edict on increasing the minimum wage by 
roughly 1.5 times as much will be issued at the end of April. In 
addition, the government has committed itself to provide for the 
electoral support of commodity producers, to regulate the prices 
for "socially important" commodities at the local level, and to 
review the question of reducing the NDS [value-added tax] and 
customs duties on individual types of foods imported into 
Russia. The government's rejection of an active policy to create 
new jobs is much more substantial. 
  But the situation in which the official number of unemployed 
is less than one-third of the true number of unemployed is 
maintained by the methods proposed. The government's commitment 
to draft special legislation to pay allowances to employees who 
have been sent on administrative leave or who do not work for 
full days attests to this, in particular. This actually 
encourages an increase in "hidden" unemployment. The commitment 
to define the maximum levels of unemployment that are socially 
acceptable at the local level is a logical continuation of such 
a policy. "Extreme measures to prevent mass dismissals" which 
have never been made more specific are being undertaken to 
achieve these indicators (in the early stages of preparing the 
agreement, freezing privatization and implementation of 
procedures to improve economic conditions were considered). 
  However, the government's failure to make clearly formulated 
demands of the trade unions may be considered as giving them a 
distinctive kind of advance payument--in the hope that the trade 
unions will not be too active in initiating a strike movement.

<F P=106> [Article by Marina Denisova, IZVESTIYA: "Reuters Gives </F>
Molchanov Carte Blanche"] 
  [Text] The largest television companies of the world have 
already been introduced into our television. Only the Reuters 
agency was left. In April on Channel 1 a program will be aired 
which for now has the conventional name "Post Scriptum." Thanks 
to the Ostankino television company, Reuters will finally break 
into our information field. 
  On Saturdays there will 50 minutes about all over the world. 
It will be an information vinaigrette made up of video materials 
on any subject: from fires in the forests of the Amazon to the 
Oscar ceremonies--the topics for the program will come from 130 
Reuters bureaus scattered throughout the world. 
  The agency's Moscow office receives "pictures" from all over 
the world 24 hours a day. Then the short subjects are sold to 
television companies--each takes a maximum of two minutes. And 
90 percent of the items are not used. "Post Scriptum" will work 
with this material. Initially they wanted to call the program 
"The World and Us." Incidentally, this name reflects the subject 
matter of the program better, but it sounds fairly hackneyed for 
our TV. 
  Ostankino is placing great hopes in this program. The deputy 
chairman of the television and radio company, Grigoriy Shevelev, 
at a news conference devoted to the grand new project proudly 
emphasized that in principle Russian journalists could create 
such a program even without help from Reuters. The problem is 
that, as always, we lag behind in technology--both the 
production of programs and technical support. Cooperation with 
Reuters, which can offer fantastic possibilities for our 
television--from the organization of television bridges from any 
point on the planet to live interviews with the Queen of England 
or Bill Clinton--is extremely advantageous for Channel 1. On the 
other hand, Ostankino's image, in Shevelev's opinion, is costing 
a great deal. True, this can be debated. At the present time the 
television company has lost its best information personnel in 
Yevgeniy Kiselev, Tatyana Mitkova, Mikhail Osokin, and other 
stars, and the news programs on Channel 1 are regularly 
withering before our eyes. 
  Representatives of the Reuters agency have not spoken about 
the project's commercial advantage for their side but they have 
not insisted on being called patrons either. 
  The Ostankino leaders are hoping for the project to be 
incredibly successful also because the extremely popular 
television journalist Vladimir Molchanov has agreed to host the 
program. According to the contract he will not only draw on the 
information agency's bottomless well but also will be able to 
order Reuters material himself. This is a privilege that none of 
our television journalists has ever had before. He will have 
complete freedom and independence in selection. And we will be 
able to see and judge the results ourselves. 
  Most likely Reuter's topics will acquire a Russian 
interpretation on Vladimir Molchanov's program. 
  This project is just the beginning of cooperation with 
Reuters, which even today is thinking about taking the next 
step--creating a joint news program. 
  "Post Scriptum" will be an information program, but it is 
not 
intended to have anything in common with "Itogi," "Namedni" or 
"Voskresenye." In turn, Molchanov announced that his program 
would not be political. Perhaps the viewers will actually see 
normal present-day life and not reminiscences of the accursed 
past or somber thoughts about a gray future. Looking at the last 
authorial programs of the popular journalist and host, many 
people were about to decide that Molchanov was "finished." It is 
no wonder that his journalist colleagues ask themselves if they 
were seeing a dying Molchanov. But we still did not forget that 
Vladimir Molchanov is a high-class professional and his 
remarkable information-entertainment program "Before and After 
Midnight" became a lively political program after the fourth 
broadcast. At the same time the lyrical Molchanov cannot get 
used to live broadcasting and the fast pace: In times that are 
now long past he hosted the "Utro" and "Vremya" programs. 
  Vladimir Kirillovich himself thinks that the program will be 
devoted primarily to the main aspects of the life of 
civilization: "We have become very gloomy people. I am afraid 
there may not be any people in all the world gloomier than those 
in Russia and the former republics of the Soviet Union. So we 
want to recall that the world lives not only with problems of 
murders, gangsterism, poverty, and racketeering. We hope that 
many of our programs will deal with special subjects. Perhaps 
the very first program will be devoted to the world of the press 
and television." 
  But fans of the "early" Molchanov should not foster 
illusions 
about a revival of "Before and After Midnight," which so many 
loved. The more so since the old team (Irina Zaytseva, 
Aleksandra Livanskaya, and Aleksey Denisov) have their own work 
and programs. Moreover, Molchanov does not want "Post Scriptum" 
to be called his program.

<F P=106> [Article by Marina Denisova, IZVESTIYA: "The Television </F>
Business in Russia"] 
  [Text] Skeptics who think that the television business in 
Russia is not profitable and sometimes operates at a loss are 
wrong. Of course, on the scale of the television company, a 
gigantic, almost uncontrollable business, it is not easy to find 
a gold mine. Filling many hours of air time is still too costly 
a luxury. 
  A more rewarding occupation for those who have decided to 
get 
in on the ground floor of the television business is to create a 
television agency. In essence world information journalism has 
been supported by such agencies for many years now. The largest 
television agency, Reuters, for example, serves more than 600 
television companies of the world. But for our country such a 
practice is a rare exception to the general rule. 
  Journalists Mikhail Beglov and Andrey Korotkov, who 
previously worked at the Main Editorial Office for Audiovisual 
Information of TASS, two years ago left state service and 
organized their own agency. At first, of course, things were 
tight--they borrowed money from acquaintances, friends of 
acquaintances, acquaintances of friends of acquaintances, and 
they took out unsecured credit in order to buy their first video 
camera. But now RTA, the only private independent television 
agency in Russia, is flourishing: It has complete independence 
with no sponsors, it has its own equipment, and two clipping 
rooms. It has a total of 20 staff correspondents and five film 
crews. RTA actively recruits stringers to cooperate, but it has 
no editors or correspondents in the usual sense. It has 
producers who can combine jobs and work as sound operators, 
lighting men, and even drivers, in spite of their ambitions. So 
as distinct from a film crew of state television, which 
consists, as a rule, of three or four people, the private agency 
can allow itself the luxury of maintaining two workers for one 
camera--otherwise, it would be threatened with ruin. 
  RTA is experiencing no shortage of clients who are thirsty 
for information and the "footage" that goes with it. More 
frequently they have to make a choice of whom to give preference 
to: a German company or an American one. No television company, 
even the wealthiest Western ones which have four to five film 
crews in Russia, can cover all the events in our turbulent 
country. All the conditions are stipulated ahead of time--each 
television company has its own style for presenting video 
materials. 
  RTA works not only on order, but also on its own initiative. 
Early in the morning in the RTA office there are reports from 
large information agencies (like INTERFAX and RIA). It also has 
its own personal sources of information--wherever they are 
possible and necessary. The producers determine where to send 
film crews and why. On busy days they can shoot up to 20 hours 
of video film. This was the case, for example, during the 
elections and the putsches. But it sometimes happens that they 
all sit in the office for a whole day smoking and looking at one 
another because nothing is happening and there is no news. As 
distinct from state structures, nobody forces anybody to work 
just to keep busy: There is no plan for the quantity of material 
produced during a day or quarter. On the other hand, there is no 
such concept as a regular day off either. If it is necessary to 
film on Sunday night then they do it, in spite of the fact that 
the day before they had returned from a week-long trip and had 
not slept for two days in a row. RTA never refuses its clients, 
even if the orders seem crazy at first glance. 
  Once in the Crimea against the background of Lastochkinoye 
Gnezdo an RTA crew filmed a meeting between Yeltsin and 
Kravchuk. The operator told the correspondent where to stand, 
but he suddenly disappeared from the frame. It turned out that 
he took a step backwards and fell, fortunately, not into an 
abyss but down a steep slope. But according to responses from 
German television viewers, who had seen the clip later, it was 
very emotional and brought some people to tears. It was apparent 
how excited the correspondent was about the negotiations between 
the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. The work of RTA workers is 
dangerous--not only in zones of combat activities when you fly 
in a helicopter and where you can be fired at by a Stinger at 
any moment or when you are filming material at the Semipalatinsk 
test site where the Geiger counter is registering off the dial, 
or where you go to film the headquarters of a fascist 
organization where they might simply punch you in the face and 
break the camera at the same time. Therefore all agency workers 
are insured for large amounts. 
  It cannot be ruled out that the producer will offer video 
materials to clients and all of them will refuse it. Some have 
shot their own film on a particular subject and some are not 
interested. The French, for example, prefer to use their own 
film. But such cases, even though they obviously cause losses, 
do not hit the overall pocketbook especially hard. They are 
individual cases. And then RTA has a group of permanent clients. 
Foreign television companies pay two to three times more for 
video news than ours do. This certainly does not mean that RTA 
does not want to deal with Russian television companies whose 
finances are constantly on the downturn. On the contrary, RTA is 
prepared to offer its video materials and services even free of 
charge. But our companies have still retained a certain inertia 
of thinking--both Ostankino and the Russian channel have become 
accustomed to relying on their own forces. And it is not even 
that they do not trust others. It is simply necessary to give 
their own staff correspondents something to do. Although 
materials with the RTA mark will show up on "Vesti" once in a 
while. A daily morning program on the Russian channel "Formula 
730" is also being created on the basis of the RTA agency. But 
this is episodic so far. 
  "Journal of Main Events of the Day" is enjoying minimum 
success. The most costly materials and the ones most interesting 
to the clients are exclusives. Such as interviews with wives of 
members of government (how they met their husbands, how they 
fell in love, where they lived and on what) with the title 
"Kremlin Wives." This "commodity" immediately found consumers. 
The RTA producers are trying to film outside Moscow as much as 
possible--any information from outside the capital sells like 
hotcakes. For example, a piece on a nuclear missile silo or a 
report on diamond mining in Yakutia. It is not easy to get 
permission to film such things. Agency workers--who are in 
principle against bribes which open all doors--have been trained 
not to give them. Therefore the main asset of any producer is 
not a personal bank account but the connections he has developed. 
  The reaction to video topics is unpredictable. Once a piece 
was filmed for ZDF on refugees from Kazakhstan. In the words of 
the bureau chief, the German public was struck most by a 
restless cat which the owner had abandoned in an empty 
apartment. They were immediately flooded with offers from people 
who wanted to bring the cat to Germany. The foreigners did not 
feel as sorry for the Russians who were forced to flee their 
homes as they did for the unfortunate animal. Or there was the 
piece about Moscow Siamese twins Masha and Dasha that affected 
everyone in Germany so much that the German television company, 
under pressure from phone calls from television viewers, brought 
the sisters to Berlin for treatment at its own expense. 
  The political independence and the reliability of RTA have 
led to a situation where its news is a marketable commodity. 
Mikhail Beglov and Andrey Korotkov, the founders of RTA, working 
with the producers, think that their brainchild has found its 
niche in the video news market and they feel comfortable there. 
So much so that the agency is expanding the sphere of its 
activity: from assisting television companies in creating 
studios to buying interesting programs from foreign production 
firms.

<F P=106> [Untitled report prepared by Marina Denisova] </F>
  [Text] As of today about 260 independent television and 
radio companies are registered in Russia. Starting next year the 
issuing of licenses will be suspended temporarily, but the 
immense waiting list of people wanting to have their own 
television and radio stations continues to grow. There are 600 
of them today. In the opinion of the representative of the board 
of the Fund for Protection of Glasnost, Aleksey Simonov, the 
influence and audience of independent and state companies are 
practically equal. 
  Muscovites, "spoiled" with six television channels, do not 
even suspect that in Siberia television viewers have a choice as 
well. Way out in Krasnoyarsk, in addition to Channel 1 
Ostankino, Russian television, and Channel 6 St. Petersburg, it 
is also possible to see programs on commercial Channel 11, in 
which four nonstate television stations are concentrated, and 
Channel 9, which belongs to the independent television company 
Afontovo. It began 24-hour broadcasting on 2 April 1993. 
Incidentally, state companies of the capital, which are groaning 
under debts to the Ministry of Communications, can broadcast at 
night only on holidays. 
  Over the year Afontovo has become the most popular channel 
in 
Krasnoyarsk. They have managed to buy their own transmitter. 
Today Afontovo has its own information service which prepares 
local news for three 20-minute broadcasts daily. 
  The Afontovo information-entertainment channel is not 
worried 
about the problem of filling air time. Thank God it has plenty 
of sources. It buys programs and films from 2X2, Russian Video, 
KTV-1, and Channel 6 St. Petersburg. Afontovo also produces its 
own programs. The services of production firms from the capital 
are very costly. 
  Almost all the independent companies earn money through 
piracy. In the words of the general director of Afontovo, 
Aleksandr Karpov, the volume of pirated products today is 
approximately 30 percent of the overall number of programs and 
films. And just a year ago his television company was an evil 
100-percent pirate. Everyone understands quite well that it is 
necessary to join up with civilization. 
  The Tomsk independent television company TV-2 is a veteran 
and has been in operation for three years already. It broadcasts 
13 hours a day. Its potential audience includes 700,000 viewers. 
TV-2 is a heroic company; during the August and October putsches 
it was the only one in Tomsk that did not stop operating. Local 
Afghanistan veterans had to protect the station so that they did 
not chop down the transmitter. Incidentally, in October, when 
the commandos stormed Ostankino, on that same Shushenskiy they 
were receiving BBC-Asia programs through a satellite with direct 
relay, and the entire Siberian region was abreast of events 
developing in Moscow. Moreover, Siberians received more complete 
information than Muscovites. 
  Samara state television does not have its own channel, it 
covers the air time of the Russian channel and successfully 
sells it to commercial organizations. So before and after 
"Vesti," instead of clips propagandizing the activity of Check 
Investment Funds, in the glorious city of Samara there is local 
advertising. The situation is unique--state television has 
managed to drive its air time in twice. 
  The association of regional independent television companies 
actually exists. The largest of them--representatives of 10 
cities of Russia and Kazakhstan--have created an enterprise 
whose goal is to provide all stations with licensed products and 
centralize the search for advertisers. Nonstate companies of 
Siberia have managed to sell their air time to large foreign 
advertising agencies, which have offered in exchange a package 
of 40 films. As a result the independent television companies 
now have not only high-class films but also advertisers of the 
world level like Coca-Cola. 
  Through collective efforts independent television companies 
are trying to work out a system for transmitting the television 
signal through the Gorizont communications satellite, which 
makes it possible to cover the territory from the Urals to 
Baykal.

<F P=106> [Report "from foreign and Russian press materials": "Gold </F>
Extraction Is Increasing"] 
  [Text] According to information from officials of the 
Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones, gold production in Russia in 1993 increased by 3.4 
metric tons over 1992, reaching 149.5 metric tons; of this 
amount, 136.2 metric tons were extracted at gold-bearing 
deposits, 8.3 metric tons were derived as a by-product in the 
processing of nonferrous ores, and 5 metric tons were obtained 
from recycled raw materials. In 1994, it is planned to increase 
gold production in the country by 3 to 4 percent over 1993. 
  In the opinion of the committee's managers, the adoption of 
a 
number of economic and organizational measures has contributed 
to relative stabilization in the sector. For example, the rights 
of the administration in regions have been extended to the 
issuance of licenses to extract precious metals and stones and 
the attraction of foreign capital in developing the deposits and 
selling the metals produced. The introduction of world prices in 
1992 to pay for the gold extracted was important as well. 
  The Russian Ministry of Finance has announced plans to 
introduce a new system this year for gold purchases in the 
country, in accordance with which producers will sell half of 
the metal they turn out in the domestic market. Under the new 
arrangement, the state will buy 50 percent of the gold produced 
in the country, 20 to 30 percent of this through the Central 
Bank and commercial banks which have licenses to conduct 
transactions in precious metals. Producers will sell the 
remaining metal in order to reinvest the funds received in 
production development. 
  A competition has been announced for the right to develop 
the 
Asachinsk and Rodniki deposits where reserves of the metal is 
estimated at 70 metric tons and the ore here has a high gold 
content--20 grams per metric ton. Interest in the competition 
has been expressed by several foreign and joint venture firms, 
including "Caminco Venture Gold" and "New Grest Mining." An 
application has also been made by the "Russian Gold Mining 
Corporation." It is expected that results of the competition 
will be reported in June. 
  The American company Morrison-Knudsen Corp. ("MK") should 
begin extracting gold in Kyrgyzstan in 1995 at an enterprise in 
which $100 million is being invested. Under the agreement 
concluded with the country's government, the wholly-owned 
subsidiary firm "MK Gold" will develop the Dzheruy gold deposit 
jointly with the Kyrgyz state company "Kyrgyzaltyn." Reserves at 
the deposit, which can be worked by the open method, are 
estimated at roughly 80 metric tons of gold, extracted from ore 
with a gold content of 6 grams per metric ton. 
  The new enterprise is expected to turn out over 4.5 metric 
tons of gold annually. Under the agreement, "MK Gold" will 
receive 30 percent of the profit from operating the mine and the 
country's government will receive 70 percent. The "Kyrgyzaltyn" 
company will acquire the right to sell the gold in the domestic 
market and in other countries. 
  Tajikistan, through the "Tajik Gold" firm, concluded an 
agreement a year ago with the "Gulf International Minerals" 
company for technical assistance in reequipping the existing 
"Kansay" enterprise. In the near future, the Canadian "Gulf 
International" company expects to receive results of the gold 
concentrates shipped to Japan from this mine. 
  Work is now under way at the Tajik mine mentioned to 
increase 
gold output, and in addition, a survey of other gold deposits in 
the country has been completed. The joint venture company has 
concluded an agreement with the Tajikistan Government to process 
tailings from the Darvas region. Under the agreement, "Gulf" 
will pay the expenses for fuel, install new equipment, and 
provide technical supervision, while the government will provide 
the mine with manpower, available equipment, and electricity. 
  According to official data, about 22 metric tons of gold 
have 
been produced in the Darvas region, where the largest alluvial 
deposit of gold in Tajikistan is located. According to the 
"Gulf" company's estimate, there are about 5 metric tons of gold 
in the tailings from this deposit, with a gold content of 2 
grams per cubic meter. The company has also surveyed the primary 
reserves of placer gold at this deposit, which are estimated at 
18 metric tons, with a gold content of 0.95 frams per cubic 
meter. "Gulf" has preference for further joint activity with 
"Tajik Gold" in developing these reserves. 
  As reported by EKOTASS, the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development will grant a loan to Uzbekistan to complete 
construction of a gold mining complex being carried out by the 
Uzbek-American joint venture "Zarafshan-Newmont." The projected 
cost of the operation is estmated at $150 million. The new 
enterprise plans to extract gold from tailings at the Muruntau 
deposit, the world's largest gold deposit where the gold can be 
extracted by the open method. 
  In Kazakhstan, the "Zoloto Kazakhstana" program, aimed at 
increasing the country's gold production, has been drafted and 
is now under way. It is assumed that by 1997, Kazakhstan may 
become one of the world's 10 largest gold-producing countries. 
  According to a report from the INTERFAX agency, Georgia 
plans 
to extract 1.5 metric tons of gold in 1994 and to increase its 
production of this metal to 4 metric tons in 1997. Georgia 
produced 1.9 metric tons in 1991, but the economic crisis in the 
country led to a decrease in the country's gold output. It is 
estimated that 1 metric ton was turned out in 1993. 
  The company "Hol-Lac Gold Mines," headquartered in Toronto, 
has concluded an agrement with the Ukrainian state company 
"Geoprognoz" for geological exploration operations to locate 
precious metals (as well as the basic nonferrous metals and 
diamonds) in Ukraine. "Hol-Lac Gold Mines" will will finance the 
operation over a 5-year period. "Geoprognoz" will provide 
assistance in obtaining authorization for prospecting and will 
provide a group of geologists to search for the minerals.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Androsenko (Yakutia): "In the North, </F>
They Pan for Gold in the Summer and Spend the Rest of the Year 
Stewing"] 
  [Text] Kular has provided the country with 153 tonnes 
of the metal. It could provide dozens more. Will it get the 
chance? 
  "We want normal living and working conditions. The 
decision is yours: If Russia and the Sakha Republic want gold, 
you have to give us a chance to mine it, provide us with all of 
the financing for the 1994 program, and make adjustments in the 
system of taxation. If you plan to continue ruining the gold 
industry of the republic and Russia, if we and our labor are no 
longer needed, give us a chance to leave Yakutia with dignity, 
allocate money from centralized funds for this purpose, and give 
us a friendly sendoff. We earned this by living in the severe 
conditions of the polar region." 
  These blunt and resentful statements are taken from a 
message 
from the miners of the polar Kularzoloto Combine to the 
president and Government of the Russian Federation and the 
president and Government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). This 
is a response to the local Ministry of Industry's decision to 
close the combine. Suddenly the hottest topics of discussion are 
the obliteration of the settlements of Kular, Severnyy, Vlasovo, 
and Entuziastov, the placement of people in new jobs, and their 
resettlement. The northerners are understandably infuriated by 
these developments. Once again, without consulting anyone or 
trying to find a compromise acceptable to all of the parties 
concerned, officials are prepared to abandon the common laborers 
to the whims of fate, leaving them defenseless against the 
present state of bedlam in Russia. 
  Yes, it is true that gold mining is a costly undertaking in 
this region, but it cannot cost more than money, as the saying 
goes, and the yellow metal is the world equivalent of money--the 
world equivalent, but not the Russian equivalent. In its efforts 
to leap into the planetary market, our government is buying gold 
from the miners at fixed prices based on the London exchange 
rate, but the miners have to buy vehicles, mining equipment, and 
fuel at domestic "floating" prices, which escaped the 
government's control long ago and are now two or three times as 
high as world prices. What kind of profit margin can they expect 
under these conditions? 
  Furthermore, that is not the only problem. Gold can only be 
panned in the summer in the Far North. The rest of the year is 
spent in preparations--the dredging of gold-bearing sand, and so 
forth. All of this work has to be done on credit. Enterprises 
have no working capital of their own, and our market-based 
government's tax rates have deprived the mining combines of any 
chance of accumulating this capital. Meanwhile, the Ministry of 
Finance and the Committee on Precious Metals have refused to 
provide advance financing for mining operations. It is a vicious 
circle. 
  Is there really no alternative to closing the mining 
enterprise and stopping the extraction of the precious metal? 
There probably is. One possible option would entail a lighter 
tax burden or even total exemption from taxes. More than half of 
the value of the gold mined by the combines is now appropriated 
for the budget. If these funds could be left at the disposal of 
the combines, they would have a chance to catch their breath and 
consider ways of keeping the production capacities operating in 
the future. The very idea of a differentiated approach to 
taxation, however, sounds heretical to orthodox market advocates. 
  In addition, there is no money for the resettlement of the 
Kular miners. The miners of Kular are indignant and are holding 
rallies. Regrettably, they have no other means of protest. It 
would be senseless to go on strike at an enterprise that is 
being closed. 
  Will the presidents choose to listen to their plea?

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Saktaganov, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk: "Sakhalin </F>
United Emirates"] 
  [Text] [Begin boxed material] This is gold. In such a 
miserable little bowl--real gold extracted by our 
poverty-stricken super-rich. It is an eternal absurdity. And, it 
seems, for Russia a rather characteristic one. There is a way 
out of this pathetic situation. Strictly speaking, there are two 
ways out. The first--to demand attention from the state, or more 
precisely, money. The second--to sell ourselves to someone 
richer. And as soon as possible. The truth lies, as it should, 
somewhere in between. Or perhaps it lies somewhere entirely 
elsewhere. In the sphere of common sense. [End boxed material] 
  Finally, almost for the first time, the interests of 
the Center and the territories have coincided in their 
intentions to "unseal" the Sakhalin shelf oil deposits. 
  At the very end of 1993, the "negotiations marathon" finally 
reached the home stretch. Representatives of the Russian 
Government and major foreign firms interested in developing the 
oil and gas deposits of the Sakhalin shelf participated in it 
for many months. Literally in the course of one week, the 
preparation of key documents was completed in Moscow, and part 
of them were even signed. Among them were several international 
investment projects whose scope and proposed influence on the 
domestic economy are simply astounding. 
  It is enough to note that by the summer of last year, when 
the negotiations on the Sakhalin off-shore deposits were in full 
swing, the overall volume of foreign investments in Russia 
comprised around $7 billion, according to the data of the 
Russian Government itself. And now let us compare. Three foreign 
consortia whose membership includes such well-known companies as 
"Shell," "Texaco," "Exxon," "Mobil" and others, intend to invest 
a sum of approximately $8-$10 billion in direct investments 
alone in the development of a relatively small area of the 
coastal zone of Sakhalin (around 17,000 square kilometers). 
  Without a doubt, the oil business is in no way reminiscent 
of 
the Western humanitarian aid to which we have already become 
accustomed. The foreign partners expect to realize profits in 
the billions here. And, we might add, with good reason. The 
development of five deposits and the geological survey of three 
prospective areas of the Sakhalin shelf open up access to a 
considerable and hitherto untouched storehouse of hydrocarbon 
raw material in a geographically favorable region. The reserves 
of only a few of the deposits which have already been confirmed 
here are estimated at about 252 million tonnes of oil (volumes 
which are fully comparable with the annual export of the entire 
former USSR) and more than 1.5 trillion cubic meters of gas. 
  Thus, in literally a few years, Sakhalin will be able to 
offer its closest foreign neighbors specifically that which they 
will acutely need. We know, for example, that by 1996 there will 
be a shortage of gas in South Korea in a volume of approximately 
4 million tonnes of RNG (rarified natural gas), while the 
guaranteed sale on the world oil and gas market, under the 
current conditions, is valued at no less than the raw material 
itself. 
  Naturally, by granting our partners in developing the shelf 
these concessions which are unprecedented in their 
technical-economic parameters, we too will not be the losers. 
For example, within the scope of the "Sakhalin-2" project, up to 
70 percent of the work is to be performed through our own 
efforts with the use of domestic building materials and 
structures. Moreover, the representatives of the VPK 
[military-industrial complex] are already formulating a list of 
enterprises which expect to stay afloat in the whirlpool of 
conversion with the aid of the unexpected currency orders. 
Within the scope of the oldest project, "Sakhalin-I," the 
Japanese-American consortium has agreed to "forgive" the former 
debt of the union government which took credits for the 
exploration of the current deposits. And, if you add the 
interest which has accumulated over the elapsed decades, the sum 
turns out to be quite significant even by all-state 
standards--around $300 million. 
  Finally, according to the results of the competition for the 
"Sakhalin-2" project which has just been concluded, the winners 
were companies which guaranteed that they would invest no less 
than $473 million in the search for oil and gas in the 
northeastern end of Sakhalin over the next six years. And, 
naturally, with the successful realization of all three 
projects, Russia will get a share of the extracted raw material, 
and its budget will be replentished by the appropriate taxes and 
bonuses granted in such cases--uncompensated payments by the 
foreign companies to the country owning the deposits. 
  The packet of Sakhalin projects has already been nicknamed 
the "second BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line]" by Far East residents. 
And this is quite understandable. With the start of development 
of the first off-shore deposits in the Sea of Okhotsk, one of 
the most remote regions of Russia which has been shortchanged in 
a social and economic respect will receive a strong impetus in 
the development of its infrastructure. It will get thousands of 
additional jobs, the latest Western technologies and even entire 
enterprises for the drilling and primary processing of the raw 
material. Hope has appeared also for reducing the shortage of 
power resources which has traditionally existed here. After all, 
every year it is necessary to bring up to 19 million tonnes of 
oil and petroleum products to the Far East from the western 
regions of the country, and the interruptions of heat and power 
supply in many local cities have already become a sad tradition. 
  The heads of several Far Eastern administrations and 
mayoralities quite reasonably expect to replentish the local 
budgets from various concessions payments. The oil dollars may 
be used to build a hospital, to reconstruct an ageing airport, 
or to extend new automobile roads and high voltage transmission 
lines... 
  The hold-up, specifically, centers around a minor matter. 
After many years of negotiations and discussions over the fate 
of the off-shore projects, in which almost everyone was 
involved--from the rank-and-file deputy of a taiga rayon soviet 
to three presidents: The presidents of South Korea, the USSR, 
and then Russia--it finally became clear that we do not yet even 
have any legislation regulating mutual relations with foreign 
companies in such large-scale undertakings. The law on 
concessions which was prepared at one time never reached the 
stage of a final reading in the former Supreme Soviet. 
  Nevertheless, we cannot do without the legislative 
formulation of conditions and forms of concessions which are 
unified for the entire country. The deposits of strategic raw 
materials are present not only in the Far East, and the foreign 
companies which are prepared to develop them, as a rule, strive 
to gain various benefits and guarantees for themselves during 
the negotiations. For example, the representatives of the 
Russian Government have already promised the international 
consortium MMMShM (unifying the corporations 
"McDermott-Marathon-Mitsubishi-Shell-Mitsui"), which aspires to 
the "Sakhalin-2" project, that it would be exempted from payment 
of all taxes with the exception of the tax on profits and 
"royalties." The consortium "Sodeco-Exxon" ("Sakhalin-I project) 
has been offered another benefit: The right to develop an 
additional, third by count, deposit in Arkutun-Dagi without the 
competition which is traditional in such cases. 
  Naturally, other investors are also presenting their 
conditions. But, you must agree, such "indulgences of the 
capitalists" will not evoke great happiness among part of the 
deputies of the new parliament. And this means that the "second 
BAM" itself may be considered a convenient pretext for rather 
heated polemics in the country's supreme legislative body, in 
the course of which not only the government may suffer, but the 
projects themselves. We might add that some of the foreign 
investors in the Sakhalin projects, who have become disenchanted 
with the omnipotence of the presidential edicts, are inclined to 
wait for adoption of a new law... 
  Then again, even before the adoption of new legislation, the 
"second BAM" is capable of bringing both pleasant concerns and 
considerable profit. For example, the upcoming cooperation with 
the foreign firms provides for one other mandatory condition: 
Within a period of five years, they must transfer the sum of 
$100 million into a specially created Fund for the Development 
of Sakhalin. Whether we like it or not, we must agree with one 
of the participations in the negotiations on the shelf projects: 
Something akin to the Sakhalin United Emirates might just arise 
in the insular oblast.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu.I. Polavskiy, program director: "The T-407 </F>
Skvorets Light Transport Plane"] 
  [Text] An analysis of the demands of potential customers 
shows that there is a need for a light-transport plane, capable 
of taking on board up to 600 kg of payload and conveying it for 
a distance of up to 600 km, and operating at airports with a 
runway of up to 600 m. This concept is known as the 
"600X600X600." The basic version of the plane should have the 
possibility of being re-equipped in the following 
variants: 

  -  Ambulance and emergency-rescue; 
  -  Forest patrol, 
with the potential for air-dropping 
fire-fighter-parachutists; 
  -  Patrol, to monitor electric power 
lines and oil and gas pipelines, as well as to serve the state 
motor vehicle inspectorate; 
  -  Performing hydrometeorological and 
ecological survey; 
  -  Aerial photography; 
  -  An air taxi to perform 
official transport; 
  -  Instruction and training. 
  In 1990, 
GosNIIGA [State Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute] 
was given the technical assignment of working out this type of 
light, multi-purpose airplane on a competitive basis, with the 
participation of A.V. Medvedev, the institute's chief 
specialist. Because of the lack of financing and numerous 
organizational problems, however, the competition was not held. 
  One of the most important criteria for determining the size, 
and to a considerable extent, the design of the plane was the 
type and amount of payload. In our case, the payload of 600 kg 
may lie in quite a broad products list -- from fuel drums and 
computer boxes to six people with luggage. The measurements of 
the cargo-passenger compartment should be determined on this 
precise basis. 
  For convenience of loading and unloading there must be a 
large cargo door. This requirement makes it preferable for the 
transport plane to have the wing placed high, which ensures 
transport vehicles convenient approach and access to the cargo 
door. Having a strutted wing reduces the weight and simplifies 
the structural scheme of the plane as a whole. The aerodynamic 
loss (the struts) will be fully justifiable in the given range 
of speeds -- up to 250 km/hr. It is also quite important for the 
high-wing monoplane to have good stability characteristics at 
large angles of incidence. This simplifies the technique of 
piloting the plane at low speeds and makes it accessible to 
fliers with average qualifications. The design adopted for the 
high-wing monoplane successfully complies with the task of using 
the patrol version of the plane, where a good range of vision of 
the lower hemisphere is needed, and also for dropping 
parachutists. 
  Since the payload is a given value in designing the plane, 
the choice of power unit variants is as a rule quite limited. 
Since the plane that we are talking about was needed, as they 
say, "yesterday," it would be extremely imprudent to incorporate 
in its design any promising, but not yet series-produced engine 
or propeller. Orientation toward engines and propellers produced 
in the West entails "cutting off" a considerable number of the 
plane's potential buyers within the country, in view of the 
impossibility of their paying part of its cost in currency. 
  There is only one series-produced aircraft piston engine 
acceptable for us in the country today. This is the 360-hp M-14P 
engine. True, calculations show that to obtain the required 
combination of take-off and landing features and a flight 
cruising speed of at least 250 km/hr, a more powerful engine is 
needed. The M-14P has substantial merits, though. In the first 
place, its weight is quite low in relation to its power. In the 
second place, it is reliable, which was proven by its long 
operation in the Yak and Su sports planes. The 435 hp M-14NTK 
engine is a further development of the M-14P. The only 
series-produced propeller for the M-14P engine produced in our 
country is the V530TA-D35 two-blade variable-pitch tractive 
propeller. 
  As for a choice between landing gear systems with nose and 
tail support, then given the planned operation of the plane on 
the basis of the airports of local airlines and the landing 
strips of the former DOSAAF [All-Union Voluntary Society for 
Assistance to the Army, Air Force and Navy of the USSR], it is 
very tempting to settle on the system with nose support, which 
gives well-known operating advantages: convenience in loading 
and unloading, a good range of vision when taxiing and less 
likelihood of a nose-over during a rough landing. To perform the 
tasks involved in landing on an unprepared area, however, a 
plane of the basic design with tail support may be suggested. 
  The conditions for operating the plane must also be taken 
into consideration when selecting the type of shock absorbers. 
Since it will not just be operated at concreted airports, the 
need arises for shock absorbers which will absorb the 
considerable energy of the shock when hitting uneven dirt areas 
during take-off and landing. Landing gear with traditional 
liquid-gas shock absorbers have this ability. Springs may also 
be used, but only in combination with a reverse liquid damper. 
  Since we are talking about a plane that is simple, quite 
reasonable in price, undemanding and reliable in operation, the 
question of retractable or fixed landing gear is clearly 
answered in favor of the "fixed type." On the other hand, 
retractable landing gear, in addition to complicating the 
structure, entails a number of operational inconveniences, 
stemming, for example, from the fact that the recesses for the 
landing gear get choked with dirt or snow when the machine is 
operated from dirt landing strips. All this speaks in favor of 
using the simple fixed landing gear on airplanes of this class. 
  The low cost of the plane is also achieved only by using 
simple structural designs and already developed materials and 
technology. The high level of technological feasibility and 
manufacturing simplicity incorporated into the design makes it 
possible to develop series production of the plane in the 
shortest time possible. This may prove to be the decisive factor 
under the present-day conditions of economic instability. 
  The structure, which has a welded truss made of pipes and 
sheathed with non-supporting panels as the air frame of the 
fuselage, may provide great advantages in this plan. As 
practical experience shows, the technological equipment for 
assembly of the truss fuselage is considerably simpler than the 
equipment needed to assemble a fuselage with a "semi-monocoque" 
type of structure, the most common in aviation today, the 
assembly of which is carried out with the basic parts of the 
frame following an exterior theoretical contour. 
  In the case of a truss structure, the basic load-bearing 
element -- the truss -- may have a simple geometric shape. 
Moreover, there is no need to maintain small tolerances on the 
outside of the fuselage contours. The latter are formed by the 
non-load-bearing panels, which considerably simplifies their 
manufacture. Precision in adhering to the outlines is ensured by 
compensators, when the panels are installed on the truss. It is 
not possible to use thinner sheathing and supporting elements of 
the non-load-bearing panels than is dictated by technological 
considerations. In this case, of course, we have a certain 
weight disadvantage as compared with the traditional structure. 
This is a sacrifice which must be borne for the sake of 
production feasibility and repairability during operation. 
  Unfortunately, as experience in working with truss 
structures 
in domestic aircraft building has shown, very careful selection 
of material is required. The heat treatment necessary after a 
structure made of 30KhGSA steel is welded often leads to its 
deformation. VNS-2 steel retains its strength characteristics in 
the area of the weld, and without subsequent heat processing, 
but is a quite expensive and scarce material. The overwhelming 
majority of light planes of similar structure, built in the 
West, use as truss material steel analogous in its 
characteristics to our 20 steel. This is what is advisable for 
use in the truss structures. 
  The sheathing panels of the fuselage can be made of aluminum 
alloy, fiberglass-reinforced plastic or dacron. To simplify the 
technology, they can be made flat or with a slight single 
curvature. 
  Based on the above-discussed considerations, the 
Aeroprogress 
enterprise is developing the light-weight multi-purpose T-407 
airplane. It is a strutted, high-wing monoplane with a normal 
aerodynamic design, a single-piston engine and a tractive 
propeller.

  THE WING AND TAIL ASSEMBLY have a traditional structure made 
of aluminum alloy. Single-slot swivel flaps are placed along the 
rear edge of the wing. 
  THE FUSELAGE is a truss structure. The truss material is 20 
steel. The panels of the sheathing are made of aluminum alloy. 
  THE LANDING GEAR is non-retractable, triple support, with a 
free-oriented nose wheel. The shock absorbers are main and front 
strut --liquid-gas. The wheels of the main struts, the braking 
wheels, with 500X150 mm tubeless tires, can be equipped with an 
automatic anti-skid system, if the buyer wishes. The wheel of 
the front strut has a 400X150 mm tubeless tire. 
  THE POWER UNIT. A series-produced M-14P 360 hp air-cooled 
piston engine with a V530TA-D35 double-bladed variable pitch 
tractive propeller is installed on the plane. The fuel tanks, 
with a total capacity of 380 l, are located in the rear parts of 
the wing brackets. 
  THE CABIN AND CARGO-PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. In the basic 
version of the plane, only the pilot's seat at the left is 
equipped with controls. The possibility of equipping the 
instructor's seat at the right with controls is provided for in 
the training variant. 
  The cargo-passenger compartment is designed to accommodate 
cargo with a total weight of 600 kg or seats for six passengers. 
Its floor is designed for a unit load of 400 kgs/m[.sup]2[/]. 
The floor and side of the compartment are equipped with hitches 
to moor the cargo and with installation points for the passenger 
seats. The measurements of the door of the cargo-passenger 
compartment, located on the left side, are 1.2 x 1.2 m. The 
pilot's cockpit is entered through doors at the right and left 
side. There is a footboard in the area of each door which is let 
down at the same time the doors open and retracted when it is 
closed. There is passage between the crew seats to the 
cargo-passenger compartment. An emergency exit is located along 
its right side. 
  AIRPLANE SYSTEMS. The electric power supply system is 27 V, 
direct current. The electric power sources on the plane are a 
3kWt generator and a 25 Amp-hour-capacity storage battery. The 
air system provides the engine startup and basic (differential) 
and emergency wheel braking, as well as retraction and lowering 
of the flaps. The fire-fighting system consists of a fire-signal 
system in the engine compartment and a fire-extinguishing 
system. The pilots' cockpit and the cargo-passenger compartment 
are equipped with a ventilation and heating system. 
<H8>  Onboard Equipment </H8>
  The plane's piloting-navigation and radio-communication 
equipment provide manual plane piloting along the air routes of 
local airlines, in the second daytime category, at any time of 
year, in accordance with the rules of visual flight over dry 
land if no thunder activity is expected, piloting in accordance 
with homing radio beacons, manual approach for landing at 
airports not equipped for landing by radio-engineering systems, 
and also approach according to homing radio beacons. If the 
buyer demands it, the plane may be equipped with a 
meteorological locator and an autopilot. 
  The plane's radio equipment consists of two USW-range radio 
stations, ensuring two-way voice communication with air-traffic 
control services on the ground and other airplanes. In addition, 
an air-traffic control transponder and onboard registration 
device are installed on the vehicle. 
  The make-up of all the airplane systems and onboard 
equipment 
was organized solely on the basis of units and instruments found 
in series production. 
  The basic features of the new aircraft are: 

  -  Reliability 
and good repairability; 
  -  Simplicity of technological and 
structural designs; 
  -  Use, in the structure, of reasonably priced 
materials and domestic units and systems in series 
production; 
  -  Ease of piloting and technical service; 
  -  The 
possibility of operation on the existing network of local 
airline airports; 
  -  Convenience of loading and unloading; 
  -  Low 
cost. 
  In the development, the task was posed of creating a 
simple, inexpensive airplane, meeting the demands of potential 
buyers, which could be produced both at large aircraft 
enterprises and at small aviation plants. 
  At the buyer's demand, a T10-540-AE2A Lycoming engine and 
set 
of Bendix King equipment can be installed on the plane.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Loktev: "The ZIL: A Head-On Collision"] </F>
  [Text] [Begin boxed material] 
  --Are ZIL trucks necessary? 
  --The tax policy undermines production. 
  --How will the government answer the demands of auto plant 
workers? 
  [End boxed material] 
  For two weeks, the main conveyer for assembly of ZIL 
automobiles has stood idle. The automatic flow lines have 
stopped, the smelting furnaces have been turned off, and the 
mighty forges and presses have fallen silent. 
  The ZIL has always been a reliable, economic and productive 
mainstay of the government. And now this support has begun to 
sway, and together with it the fate of the almost 100,000-man 
collective. Moreover, the paralysis of the main Moscow 
automobile plant is about to spread at any moment to the 2,000 
supplier enterprises of the AMO [Automobile Moscow Society] ZIL, 
bringing with it the threat that many more tens of thousands of 
workers will be left without a job or means of existence. 
  In the situation of forced idleness, the ZIL trade union 
committee has stepped up its work, as have the plant's Sotsprof 
[Association of Socialist Trade Unions] and "Zashchita" trade 
union associations. The former held a meeting of representatives 
of the ZIL labor collectives. The latter two held a meeting near 
the second entryway which drew, by our accounts, no more than 
500 people. 
  During the meeting, the base of the monument to I. 
Likhachev--the first "red" director of the ZIL--was covered with 
slogans calling for the workers to enter the ranks of the 
Sotsprof, to re-elect the trade union committee, to increase 
wages by 2.5 times, to guarantee employment, and to dismiss the 
director from his duties. 
  We may evaluate the fairness of the demands in various ways. 
Whether to agree with them or not--that is another question, 
albeit an important one. The main thing, and I have once again 
become convinced of this while listening to the speakers, were 
the emotions of the meeting--that the method used in the past 
was ineffective in solving the dead-end problems. I believe many 
of those who gathered that day at the plant's entryway 
understood this. Yet I do not have the heart to condemn the 
meeting participants. The working man, driven to desperation and 
losing his perspective in life, grabs onto any possibility of 
expressing his protest. 
  The automotive giant stands idle. Maybe its products are not 
needed, not in demand? That is not so. An impressive figure was 
cited at the meeting of the labor collectives--159,000 
automobiles. That is the order for the current year. However, 
the buyers have no money, and therein lies the secret. 
  Yet how much does the ZIL pay in municipal and federal 
taxes? 
You would not believe it--92 percent from each ruble of profit. 
Under such conditions, how can the ZIL, which is no longer 
state-owned but has now been changed over to joint stockholding, 
increase wages? (We might add that 20 percent of the stock 
belongs to the state, and for this reason the government should 
not cast the plant to the whims of the market elements). How to 
develop, how to acquire new equipment, and finally how to 
support the huge plant housing fund? Questions, questions, 
questions... And they are aimed not only at the government. 
  The plant management also caught it at the meeting. 
  "Today the working man has no time for politics. He has 
grown 
tired of them," said director Vladimir Petrov. "Where are the 
new automobiles? Why is it that handicraftsmen work and survive, 
while a huge plant with competent engineers and skilled workers 
is falling apart?" 
  "People have worked for 20-30 years, and now what--they have 
to collect bottles for a piece of bread. The average wage at the 
plant is 90,000. But this is due to the exorbitant salaries of 
the managers of various ranks. The workers are being laid off, 
while the managers are hatching more new structures which are 
being tacked on. And they are not answerable to anyone. If the 
workers knew that these structures operate for the good of the 
plant--by all means, they would support them. But that is not 
the case. So why should we hatch more parasites?" 
  The meeting adopted an appeal to the government in which the 
ZIL workers demanded an immediate review of the program of 
financial-economic revitalization of the plant which they had 
developed, as well as a positive resolution of the main 
questions: 
  --to review the tax policy in the interests of the 
producers; 
  --to write off the indebtedness of the enterprise to the 
budget and extra-budgetary funds, as being unconnected with the 
production activity of the ZIL; 
  --to restore the granting of free housing to those on the 
plant's waiting list; 
  --to grant the enterprise special-purpose state credit. 
  Well, and what will happen if the authorities answer with 
refusal? The ZIL workers intend to picket the government 
buildings and are also ready to declare a political stirike. 
Such are the sentiments at the capital's largest enterprise.

<F P=106> [Interview with AMO ZIL General Director Yevgeniy Brakov, </F>
conducted by Stanislav Afonin: "The ZIL: A Head-On Collision"] 
  [Text] General Director Yevgeniy Brakov on the 
reasons for the acute crisis. 
  [Correspondent] Yevgeniy Alekseyevich, the threat of 
collapse 
hangs over the automotive plants of Russia, including also the 
ZIL. Why has such a thing happened? 
  [Brakov] The breakup of the Union has led to a sharp 
reduction in the production of our basic product--automobiles. 
While in 1985 we manufactured 212,000 trucks, already in 1993 we 
were able to assembly only 100,000, and that with some 
difficulty. Production continues to decline due to lack of 
consumer funds. Such a thing has never happened before at the 
ZIL. The collective is literally in shock. After all, not that 
long ago we supplied the army with somewhere on the order of 
55,000 "ZIL-131" vehicles. Last year this figure was only... 
640. The farms bought about 30,000 vehicles annually. Last year 
this figure was only... 200. Ukraine used to buy 22,000 
automobiles. Today, due to the non-clearance of payments in 
rubles, its market has in fact been lost to us. The situation is 
about the same with Kazakhstan, the Central Asian states, as 
well as all the former Union republics. 
  It is difficult for me, the director, to explain to the 
workers what has happened. Up until recently, the payment for 
our equipment came to the Central Bank of Russia. But because 
there was no balance of payments between Russia and the 
Commonwealth countries, the money was returned. 
  Today we may supposedly manage our products as we see 
fit--we 
may sell to whomever we want. Yet in fact this is not so. We are 
deprived of the opportunity of working directly with our 
partners. Why? Why, because the state hinders the transfer of 
money. Moreover, they have taxed us from all sides with all 
manner of taxes. 
  [Correspondent] If I understand you correctly, the 
government 
has removed itself from any aid to state enterprises? 
  [Brakov] I would go even farther. It has not only removed 
itself, but it hinders us in our normal operations. Even when 
there was the ruble transfer of money, its normal receipt for 
our products was hindered. Today we have been deprived 
altogether of a sales market in the former USSR republics. Both 
they and we have been placed in a most difficult position. The 
ZIL is forced to independently seek means of mutual accounting 
with its partners through third countries, through barter and 
commodity exchange. 
  Despite the optimistic assurances of certain state leaders, 
the decline in production continues. How will we survive? After 
all, what is the ZIL conveyer? Standing "behind the back" of 
each person working at it, there are at least 100 people. These 
are metal producers, miners, manufacturers of electrical wire, 
glass, tires, plastic, and so forth. If the automotive plant 
stops, the entire series of enterprises begins to get feverish. 
We can imagine how many people find themselves under the threat 
of unemployment. 
  Today in Russia practically all the state enterprises are 
debtors. We all owe each other. And the state--through taxes. 
The government has not settled accounts with the peasants for 
grain, and they have no money to buy equipment, spare parts or 
fuel-lubricant materials. Seventy percent of the pool of ZIL 
automobiles on the farms are at least 8 years old. Our equipment 
is expected to last 10 years. What will happen in 2 years? 
  Or let us take another problem. It was decided that working 
capital would not be re-appraised with the re-appraisal of 
surplus finished products. We were also promised preferential 
credits for replentishing our working capital. The government 
has still not fulfilled its obligation. Our plant, like other 
state enterprises having a large reserve of material resources 
and long-standing economic ties, has found itself in a trap. If 
we do not get state support, the ZIL will once again grind to a 
halt. And for a long time. 
  [Correspondent] And what are you yourselves doing in order 
to 
keep afloat? 
  [Brakov] Unfortunately, little here depends on the plant. 
First of all, we must stop the bacchanalia with the level of 
wages in the sector. Judge for yourselves. Next to us is another 
plant, and the wages of its workers are two or three times 
higher. Compare them with the automobile industry abroad. The 
wage level at different enterprises fluctuates there by only a 
few dollars. The ZIL worker today earns an average of 100,000 
rubles [R]. What can you buy for that? 
  Secondly, we must immediately settle accounts with the farm, 
with the army and with the defense industry. Our contractors 
will have money, and they will begin to take the automobiles. 
Then we too will deduct funds to the state budget. 
  Thirdly, it has long been time to straighten out the matter 
of taxes. They have simply suffocated us, the manufacturers. At 
the initiative of the government, there was a re-appraisal of 
the fixed capital. For the ZIL there was a 28.7-time increase. 
Up until recently, we paid tax in the amount of 1.5 percent on 
the fixed capital. Last year this was R400 million. Now we must 
pay 2 percent. It seems that this is not so much, only half a 
percent more. But this is already not R400 million, but rather 
R40 billion. Last year our profits for the entire ZIL were R60 
billion. Is it conceivable that we can withstand such a tax 
press? 
  We are up to our ears in credit debts. We are being granted 
credits at 250-300 percent, and for a period of 2 or 3 months. 
The banks will not risk giving money for a long term. 
  How can we speak of any kind of development or technical 
progress if the plant is always working feverishly. We are 
living one day at a time. Not living, but surviving. A few years 
ago, the decision was made regarding the changeover of the ZIL 
to the manufacture of automobiles which operate on diesel fuel. 
We began building a diesel engine plant in Yartsevo of Smolensk 
Oblast, and at the main plant we began developing extensive 
press and body production. We began developing and modernizing 
branch plants. Now, it turns out, no one needs any of this. We 
might ask, who is going to untangle all this (supposedly 
market-related) mess?

<F P=106> [Article by A. Loginov: "In a Financial Trap: Where the </F>
Orenburg Locomotive Repair Plant Has Found Itself"] 
  [Text] Many enterprises which were only recently the 
pride of domestic industry, having found themselves in a 
difficult situation, are suspending or cutting back production 
and converting to the output of new products. 
  Transport enterprises, which are the connecting link 
between the sectors of the country's national economic complex, 
have not survived this ordeal. Indeed, it can be no other way: 
the continuing recession in industrial and agricultural 
production inevitably leads to a reduction in the volumes of 
transport along the steel mainlines, to losses of revenue and to 
the difficulties attendant on these processes. 
  While the railroads and their divisions, with structural 
subdivisions at the sites, directly connected with the customers 
with freight and passenger transport, still somehow manage to 
"get out of their difficulties," however, the repair plants for 
transport have found themselves in a more complex, two-sided 
situation. On the one hand, located on the territories of 
specific railroads, but independent of them, they work according 
to the plans of the former plant main administration, converted 
into the Roszheldorremmash AO [Joint-Stock Company] and 
Vagonremmash, for all the mainlines of Russia and the CIS. On 
the other hand, these enterprises, specialized at one time to 
repair specific types of rolling stock, depend directly on the 
railroads: will the necessary number of diesel locomotives, for 
example, be planned and supplied to them, or will the railroads 
prefer to put them in good order under depot conditions, thus 
saving funds and trying to maintain the corps of repairmen? The 
second point of dependence is whether they will be paid on time 
for the equipment repaired at the plant shops or, pleading the 
absence of "real" money, will the railroads "dawdle," literally 
bringing the plant workers to their knees. 
  It is in this precise situation that the Orenburg Diesel 
Locomotive Repair Plant has found itself. When I prepared for an 
out-of-town assignment to the South Urals Railroad, I never 
supposed that I would hear there an SOS signal in the literal 
sense of the words. 
  In conversations with workers of various ranks in 
Chelyabinsk, and after that in Orenburg, the last point on my 
trip, however, I heard that the locomotive repair plant here is 
on the brink of a complete (!) shutdown, and that some of its 
shops and plant management departments have already been forced 
to work only four, three and even two days a week... and that 
the last wages here had been paid only for November of last year. 
  I found out about this from a conversation with A. 
Sinyanskiy, chairman of the rayon trade union of the Orenburg 
Division of the road. In complaining about the deterioration in 
the social situation of the railroad workers of his 
"agricultural" division, as compared with the neighboring 
"industrial" divisions, where such giants as the Chelyabinsk, 
Magnitogorsk and Orsk-Khalilovo metallurgy enterprises, and 
their attendant machine-building enterprises, still provide an 
opportunity to turn the wheels, he told me about the fewer 
possibilities for building housing and social-cultural 
facilities. They were threatened, he said, by a triple pull -- 
the Orenburg Division, the Orenburgtransstroy Trust and the 
locomotive repair plant -- to rebuild the school camp, to get 
away from the dilapidated temporary structures, so that the 
children could go there in the summer for recreation, and the 
rest of the time -- the adults. They were not up to it. 
Particularly the locomotive repair plant, which had already 
found that it was in no condition to maintain its own Palace of 
Culture (this would cost a lot!) and had transferred it to the 
balance of the local organs of authority. They had similarly 
"given up" a shop with an area of 6,000 square meters, built 
with no small effort (incidentally, on the eve of the 
perestroyka which had begun in the country). Of the 3,200 people 
working at the plant three years ago, only 1,860 are left today. 
  The eternal Russian question arises: "What is to be done?" 
Or: "Where did we go and what have we come to?" 
  I had a slightly difficult talk about that with Vladimir 
Nikolayevich Pankov, director of the Orenburg Locomotive Repair 
Plant, and after that back in Moscow, with Anatoliy Ivanovich 
Chumachenko, former director of this plant. He headed the 
enterprise at the end of 1984, coming from the post of chief 
engineer at the Ufa Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant, led it from 
break-down to prosperity, and in 1990 was appointed chief 
engineer of the Plant Main Administration of the MPS [Ministry 
of Railways] -- now the Roszheldorremmash AO. 
  So the plant, which had come from being among those lagging 
behind to being one of the foremost plants, from the steam 
locomotive age to the diesel locomotive age, and had now begun 
to master the repair of electric locomotives at the same time, 
suddenly finds itself a beggar hero at the crossroads. It has 
slipped from the yearly repair of 400 diesel locomotive sections 
(its capacities made even 600 possible) to 112 last year. They 
were slated to issue over two dozen electric sections from 
repair -- they only managed 18. It was not their fault: last 
year they received only 20 percent of the funds which had been 
slated for allocation to the plant to re-equip the sections. 
  This year they planned to put 50 electric locomotives in 
good 
working order, have succeeded in concluding contracts with the 
roads for only 5, and not a penny has been allocated so far for 
this in the first quarter. All the same, in January they issued 
two, the same number in February, and in March -- one, the last 
one. What lies ahead? 
  They concluded a contract with the neighboring Tselina 
Railroad (since the Russian ones are in no hurry) to repair 35 
diesel locomotives. Not a bad order for these days. A 
misunderstanding arose with the clearing accounts, though: the 
leaping Russian Ruble finds no meeting point with the Kazakh 
Tenga. What could the neighbors use to settle accounts -- metal? 
Because of customs and other twists, however, it turned out to 
be over 1.5-fold more expensive. They have had to suspend the 
repair, setting the locomotives aside on spare tracks until 
things are cleared up -- although this is unprofitable for both 
parties. 
  There is a similar situation with Ukraine. Even though (once 
again!) an intergovernment agreement was signed, and an 
inter-railroad and interbank.... The Poltava Diesel Locomotive 
Repair Plant, to which the Orenburg plant supplied a substantial 
number of cylinders, piston rings, etc., took on the repair of 
passenger TEP60 diesel locomotives for the Russian railroads. It 
would seem to be mutually advantageous: work for them, work for 
us. Again, however, there are financial-economic and other sorts 
of obstacles. 
  "Machines came from Poltava twice," Pankov told me. 
"Realizing the situation, we issued what they needed on credit 
(it reached 64 million rubles [R]). They came a third time, 
cursing, and said they had transferred R120 million. But this 
got bogged down somewhere." 
  "We have as many debts as a dog has fleas," Vladimir 
Nikolayevich got excited and opened up his financial sheets. "We 
owe R209 million for electric power, R195 million for heat, R170 
million for gas and R49 million for water." 
  He further cites the millions in budget withholdings, every 
possible compulsory fund, taxes, and for this item alone the sum 
jumps beyond a billion. The result: the plant owes R3.7 billion, 
and it is owed R4.3 billion. It would seem that there is a plus 
of R600 million in their favor, but how do they claim it? The 
railroads for which they are repairing equipment and supplying 
spare parts cannot get cash from their customers either, and are 
most often satisfied with barter. 
  Take this example. Last December the plant shipped commodity 
output worth R1,409 million to the roads, but these transferred 
only R501 million (one-third) to its current account: in 
January, respectively R1,507 million and R386 million 
(approximately one-fourth). What is more, accounts with their 
clients were partially settled by barter in payment of the debt, 
in December by R475 million and in January -- by R670 million. 
The arithmetic was similar in February. For the rest -- just 
wait. 
  The plant workers, in order to survive and stay afloat 
somehow, are taking out a loan at the Orenburg Industrial Bank 
at 215 percent annual interest. But they have to pay off their 
accounts -- and from nothing, if everything to the last drop is 
taken from the current account? 
  The plant is in an upheaval. How many times has its director 
(don't envy Pankov!) appealed for help to his own ministry, his 
own Roszheldorremmash AO. I cannot say that they do not listen 
to the voice crying in the wilderness there. They listen, advise 
and try to help (voices and requests of this sort, though, are 
also heard from other enterprises). They telephone and send 
plenipotentiaries to the roads, in order to force their 
directors to pay up, to compensate the plant workers in some way 
for what they owe. 
  I ask the present director and the former director the same 
"seditious" question: about sanctions against the railroads, 
which for months have not transferred payments for the 
locomotives the plant has repaired and the spare parts it has 
supplied. After all, they are charging their own customers 
two-percent fines for each day (!) and if even this does not 
work, they can stop feeding the railcars needed to ship the 
products of the debtor-enterprises. 
  "No," I hear the same answer from both Pankov and 
Chumachenko, "we are not applying this sort of sanction against 
the railroads. Otherwise, we would get no orders at all from 
them for equipment repair (and so they fell to the limit)." 
  One could probably dispute this "truism." If today we are 
making practically no orders and are buying no new locomotives 
(just like railcars), are writing them off by the thousands, and 
are dismantling for spare parts the ones that have served out 
their lifetime, do we still have to repair the ones that are in 
operation and keep them in good working order?! It is right here 
that you can not make do with depot repair, however much it is 
considered cheaper and more advantageous for the railroads than 
plant repair. 
  This is the subject of a special conversation -- and we will 
continue it. For the time being, Roszheldorremmash helped the 
sinking plant "beat" the scheduled crumbs of debts out of the 
roads and obtain from one of the banks in the capital an R500 
million loan at 230 percent interest. 
  I say: "But this is the regular financial noose, into which 
the plant falls without having got out of the first one." I 
hear, in answer: "How else can it be?" 
  In reality -- how else can it be? At the plant, for four 
months, from November to the beginning of March, the telephones 
were silent (the communications workers disconnected them for 
non-payment of a R25 million debt). After all, now they can cut 
off electric power, heat, gas.... Therefore, in drawing up the 
loan, the tough condition of the plant was presented -- the 
money will go to pay off debts, for supplies of metal and other 
things for a repair facility.... Not a ruble for wages.... 
  "I am ashamed to look the people in the eye," Pankov said 
bitterly. In a little over 15 years at the plant, he has gone 
from foreman to shop chief, deputy chief engineer and head 
technologist of the enterprise, and has done everything to make 
work and living conditions better. "And what have we come to 
now?" Pankov takes from the table a heavy stack of applications 
and requests. "It is indeed a disgrace when people, as a favor, 
ask for an allotment from what they have earned but has not been 
paid them! For one -- for a trip to a wedding, another asks to 
be issued leave pay for December (and this is -- in February!) 
to repair his house.... A single mother: her son is a student in 
a technical school that requires payment, allot R120,000.... 
Petr Nikitovich Kondratyev, a veteran (46 years of labor 
service, 37 of them at the plant) writes: I am ashamed, as they 
say, to `beg,' but the heating unit in my home is out of order. 
Before, I could have bought one for half of my monthly pension, 
but now half a year's is not enough -- it costs R535,000." 
  All right, the director thinks, we can send an experienced 
mechanic to the old man, he can do something to help. For the 
rest, though, where can we get money "to live on?" We used to be 
able to release part of the receipts from the plant dining hall 
for this, but now, when we have "frozen" the wages for the 
workers, we have been forced to introduce the coupon system. 
  The plant has stopped updating equipment and rebuilding 
shops 
and sections. Because of a lack of funds to maintain the 
facilities for social purposes, as has already been noted, it 
has been deprived of its Palace of Culture, and has stopped 
rebuilding the camp for the school children. It is increasingly 
difficult to maintain the housing fund, and this means 55 houses 
with an area of over 100,000 square meters. 
  Kindergartens.... Whereas before the plant workers were 
provided with free catering there, and the plant repaired them 
and equipped them with modern services and utilities, now it 
just might allot a bucket of paint for cosmetic repair. 
  Medicine.... A branch of the railroad hospital, a 
polyclinic, 
and also dispensaries, which took prizes in their day, are 
located on the territory of the plant microrayon. The polyclinic 
has been under repair for three years -- there is still a lack 
of funds. There are simply not enough of them for the very 
expensive maintenance. 
  The base PTU-12 [vocational-technical school]. At one time 
its graduates were guaranteed work places at the plant. They 
worked out a program for mastering vocations in a broad range of 
specialties: a lathe operator, so that he could work at a boring 
machine or a jig-boring machine with programmed control; a 
welder, for both electric and gas welding. 
  "So if we give up the PTU, where teenagers are given 
dormitory housing, and instruction in good classes and 
workshops," asks Pankov, "will they go out on the street? Into 
business? Or earn their living doing something else. It is a 
pity, after all, most of the kids in the school used to live in 
children's homes. Does this mean condemning them to 
homelessness?" 
  When meeting directors of various ranks at the South Urals 
and chatting about their present difficulties, I asked about the 
plant that was suffering the misfortune. I heard: 
  "If the plant shuts down -- it is bad, of course. But if 
this 
happens to the railroad -- everything will go away." 
  This is probably true. We must not forget, though: it is a 
question not simply of one of the repair plants, but also of an 
enterprise which supplies a broad products list of spare parts 
for the railroads of Russia and the CIS. This can have an effect 
on their work. 
  It is not yet too late, this growing disintegration must be 
stopped.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Osipov, deputy chief of the Locomotive </F>
Service of the October Railroad: "Today Spare Parts, but 
Tomorrow?...."] 
  [Text] The locomotive fleet is growing old. It is 
virtually impossible to replace the machines that have worked 
out their life under the conditions of the production slump and 
the severance of ties with the enterprises of the near abroad, 
and indeed, it is to no purpose. How can the available machines 
do their work and how long will there be enough of them? 
  All the problems of the diesel locomotive fleet (and on the 
October Railroad it is the predominant one) can be clearly seen 
from the example of one of the major enterprises on the network 
-- the Volkhovstroy Locomotive Depot. In 1988, 135 freight 
locomotives were maintained here. With the reduction in the 
transport volume, some of the machines were transferred to the 
Petrozavodsk Depot. Now only 70 are left at Volkhovstroy. In 
order to keep them in good working condition, they have been 
assigned to locomotive and comprehensive repair brigades. What 
is more, the personnel selected are quite qualified, experienced 
people, and make it possible to maintain the diesel locomotives 
at the necessary level. Moreover, they introduced a set of 
equipment here for technical diagnosis of the locomotives. 
  No matter how they cared for them, though, the machines 
naturally get out of order. The TE10 is obsolete. Its D100 
diesel, developed at the dawn of diesel locomotive traction, 
does not guarantee reliable work. 
  The M62 diesel locomotive, developed in its time for 
railroads in European countries and intended for light, or 
rather, export work, found itself on Russia's difficult proving 
grounds. On the Volkhovstroy-Petrozavodsk-Kem and 
Volkhovstroy-Cherepovets sections, it had a hard time pulling 
four-five-thousand tonne consists. This locomotive is in general 
not suited for intensive hauling of such consists. In the future 
it will be even worse, for after all, the diesel locomotives are 
wearing out. For example 130 M62 machines have been in operation 
on the October Railroad for 20 years now, and another 57 M62 
diesel locomotives will reach this milestone in two years. 
Series TE10 and M62, with low-power diesels, are unreliable in 
operation, not to mention the fact that they are uneconomical 
and do not meet ecological requirements. They should be replaced 
immediately! Only, with what? 
  Operations workers will still be able to work on these 
diesel 
locomotives for some time, but this will cost them a pretty 
penny. The TEP70, TEM7 and 2TE116 diesel locomotives are 
equipped with more powerful diesels. They rarely break down en 
route, are more economical and ecologically cleaner -- they do 
not have fuel or oil leaks, nor other harmful emissions. 
  The thought comes to mind: why not put more powerful 
four-stroke diesels on the TE10 and M62 locomotives? Even under 
the present crisis conditions, there are plants with enough 
technical potential to manufacture them. They manufacture 5D49 
diesels at Penza and Kolomna, and can make them at Bryansk. The 
collectives of these enterprises would be glad to have our 
orders. Incidentally, there is experience in this. GUDOK 
reported on what happened in Germany when the time came to 
exchange the diesels on the diesel locomotives. They did not 
write off the machines for scrap metal there, but announced a 
competition, in which the best known diesel locomotive building 
firms would take part. The managers gave their preference to our 
Kolomna Plant. It is a pity that we have not proved to be so 
enterprising! 
  Under the conditions of the breakdown in economic relations, 
we must set up direct cooperation with enterprises. For example, 
we have a good business contact with the Lyudinovo Plant, which 
performs capital repair of TEM7 diesel locomotives. We sent a 
TEP70 to the Kolomna Diesel Locomotive Building Plant after 
eight years of operation, and hope that they will do a good job 
of renovating it. These direct ties with the plants are 
advantageous to the railroad. 
  We have to work within the limits of our technical 
potentials. For example, last year, at the Volkhovstroy Depot, 
we plagued the life out of them with a mass of chips on the 
wheelpairs, caused by a multitude of track defects. We had to 
machine 672 wheelpairs in the spring. We did not manage to do 
this completely. Complications came up on the road. The 
Petrozavodsk Depot had to machine the wheelpairs of the TE10MU 
diesel locomotives because the wheel tires were worn, and the 
time has come to do this on the 2TE116 as well. How could we 
operate if we had only 120 wheelpairs for the whole fleet of 390 
sections! 
  The road is in debt. Plant prices for capital repair are 
becoming inaccessible. So we have had to handle this work 
ourselves. Last year we carried out capital repair of the first 
batch of over 20 sections. This year we plan to put 75 sections 
in good working order this way. At the same time, the quality of 
the depot work is in no way inferior to that of the plants. This 
is the limit, though, our technical base is not highly 
developed, and it became possible to perform capital repair only 
when there was a reduction in the demand for "hoisting" because 
of the drop in transport volume. 
  The Byborg Depot also had to do hoisting repair. We hope 
that 
we will be able to repair 48 sections of the M62 diesel 
locomotive there. This will make it possible to fully guarantee 
the road's need for this type of work in the next two years. 
  There is one special feature here, though: diesel locomotive 
equipment, which we used to get from the MPS [Ministry of 
Railways] main administrations through our requisitions, now, 
just like spare parts, is ordered by the road's 
material-technical supply service. But the road doesn't have the 
money to get it. As a result, the diesel locomotive fleet has 
found itself without turbines, reducing gears, small electric 
motors, wheelpairs and diesels. We can still get some of these, 
but on the road the clearing accounts for capital repair are 
proceeding according to an "advice note," and this type of 
purchase requires "real" money. 
  The plants of the former Ministry of Heavy, Transport and 
Power Machine Building and some of those of our former TsTVR 
[Main Administration for Locomotive Repair Plants of the USSR 
Ministry of Railways] became joint-stockholding companies. They 
work only for cash or with pre-payment. This stumps the railroad. 
  Just what will happen to the diesel locomotive fleet on the 
October Railroad? 
  About 60 TEP60 diesel passenger locomotives will be operated 
up to the year 2005. Only the Poltava Plant will perform their 
capital repair. We on the October can do only the hoisting, and 
do only one section a month of that. 
  We have 115 TEP70 diesel locomotives. Ten of them need 
capital repair this year. This is possible. But after that, the 
process of locomotive wear will increase. There is a danger that 
the Kolomna Plant will not stretch to this work. Indeed, we have 
no money for it. I think that the MPS should give the road 
permission to perform routine second and third phase repair. We 
can absolutely cope with this. The mileage norms established by 
the manufacturing plant should remain. The problem of the 
technological reserve of wheelpairs and electric traction 
engines must also be solved (so far no one is doing this in 
Russia). 
  Even though we have found a temporary way out for spare 
parts 
for the series M62 machines and its modification -- we dismantle 
old locomotives -- industry should in no case curtail their 
production, or else these locomotives will be laid up everywhere. 
  We can still operate the Hungarian diesel trains for about 
five or six years. After that they will have to be replaced, 
since there are no spare parts for their repair. This problem 
must be solved as soon as possible. 
  I think that other roads that have a large diesel locomotive 
fleet are experiencing the same difficulties that we are. We 
have one task: together with the ministry, draw outside 
enterprises more widely into the production of spare parts, 
engines, assemblies and units. The diesel locomotive fleet must 
be saved.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Kasatyy, GUDOK correspondent: "Losses due to </F>
Sub-Standard Performance -- 700 Million Rubles"] 
  [Text] An important reserve for increasing the 
economic efficiency of railroad work is the elimination of 
wrecks and accidents, and reduction of cases of sub-standard 
performance in train and shunting operations. 
  Last year there were 799 cases of sub-standard performance, 
4 
wrecks and 3 accidents on the Volga Railroad. 
  Yu. Tsittel, chief of this railroad, reported at the 
technical-economic council which took place, that the losses 
from cases of sub-standard performance, accidents and wrecks in 
1993 alone constituted over 700 million rubles [R]. Losses due 
to late delivery of freight and commercial rejects were high. 
Three wrecks out of four were because of track workers: labor 
and technological discipline is low among fitters, brigade 
leaders and even foremen. 
  As the speaker noted, according to last year's results, 
because of the increase in sub-standard performance and the most 
flagrant violations of safety rules, hardly a single road 
management could be given a satisfactory evaluation. There are 
almost twice as many absentees and drunks per thousand workers 
on the Volga Railroad than on the average for Russian railroads. 
  Nearly always -- the established norms for repairing and 
operating railcars and locomotives, STsB [Signalization, 
Centralization and Blocking] and communication devices and other 
transport-technical devices are violated. 
  "Our main trouble," said B. Ladyzhenskiy, first deputy chief 
of the railroad, "is that we do not fulfill orders, but after 
all, these documents formulate and define, with maximum 
precision, the specific requirements for the workers carrying 
out their duties, the directors of the lower subdivisions, 
divisions, services and the road management. 
  "We have poor discipline and little sense of responsibility, 
though. A railcar inspector goes out to process the trains with 
a hook and an electric lantern, not having on him the necessary 
gauges or measuring instruments, and thinks that this is normal. 
By no means every road foreman knows how to use a track gauge 
correctly. 
  "On two occasions recently I headed a road commission 
checking the safety conditions on the Yershov Division," Boris 
Timofeyevich went on, "Well? The Krasnyy Kut junction was a 
disaster, because they work on the `take a chance' system there. 
The inspectors pay calls there, but what use are these journeys: 
they jot down various notes, as a matter of form, but take no 
measures against safety violators. At the Pugachevsk Depot, 
again on the Yershov Division, locomotives issued for passenger 
trains are not inspected by a command staff, as the rules 
require.... 
  "The incompetence of those who are involved in train and 
shunting operations has taken on a simply mass, threatening 
nature. This example was given: at one depot, because of the 
ignorance of the crew, it was not the electric traction motor of 
a locomotive, which had got out of order, that was disconnected, 
but -- the motor of one in good working order. In another case, 
the engineer sent his assistant to shut off the distributor 
valve on a rail car, but the assistant went and shut off the 
brake end cocks and nearly deprived the train of the required 
brake pressure. It was a good thing that the engineer noticed in 
time and corrected the error, or they would have gone out onto 
the section without any brakes." 
  These and numerous other examples of dense technical 
incompetence attest to the fact that locomotive workers, railcar 
workers, track workers, transport workers and other workers 
involved in ensuring traffic safety have been very badly trained 
everywhere. The ignorance and lack of skill of rank-and-file 
people carrying out their duties very often leads to 
sub-standard work and damage to locomotives en route. 
  The poor organization of training and raising qualifications 
attests to the fact it is not those who just recently sat, let 
us say, at a locomotive control panel, and not the novice 
transport workers who violate the safety rules, but the 
experienced workers. A first-class engineer drives a train with 
false information about the brakes. 
  This means that training should be continuous, in order to 
raise the vocational level of the workers. 
  As I. Tsinkerman, chief of the Signals, Communications and 
Computer Technology Department, justifiably noted, the 
competency of many commanders of various ranks is such that they 
themselves must be taught the ABC's of the railroad business. 
What kind of teachers are they, then, for their subordinates? 
  V. Nikitin, deputy chief of the railroad for Personnel and 
Social Problems, expressed anxiety about the fact that the 
number of engineers and technicians at the sites is being 
sharply reduced. At the Astrakhan Division, one can literally 
count on one's fingers the number of working railroad men who 
are taking correspondence courses at transport VUZes [higher 
educational institutions] and technical schools. Many positions 
are held by practical workers whose technical knowledge is very 
limited. It is clear that these people are not capable of 
conducting technical training or directing production at today's 
level. V. Nikitin noted that on the Pallasovka track 
subdivision, they feel sorry for their drunken workers, and do 
not fire them, but make drunkards of them and others. What kind 
of safety can be ensured there from a track worker who is "under 
the weather"? 
  Safety and finances are inseparable -- this was the essence 
of the speech made by A. Korolkov, chief of the Financial 
Department. Freight loading and shipment is now reduced by over 
30 percent. This is where the large deficit in the road budget 
comes from. Losses here due to sub-standard work, accidents and 
wrecks constitute hundreds of millions of rubles. 
  Unfortunately, at the technical council, especially 
dedicated 
to safety, not a word was said about whether losses from 
slip-shod workers are recovered. Later on I met with inspectors 
and financiers, in order to get an answer to this question. It 
turns out that damages can and must be recovered from those who 
damaged rails, locomotives or railcars, in the railroad's favor, 
in an amount not exceeding the monthly wage of the guilty person. 
  "Was much recovered from slip-shod workers during 1993?" I 
expressed my interest to A. Korolkov, chief of the Financial 
Department. 
  "So far, not all the amounts, since the materials on recent 
accidents and cases of sub-standard work, and institution of 
criminal proceedings against the guilty parties are at the stage 
of investigation in the people's courts. Even if they decide 
that the losses are to be recovered, quite a while will pass 
before the money begins to come in.... And the prices for the 
things will be different." 
  Nothing was said, either, about the public-spirited people, 
or about the role of the assistant directors of the enterprises, 
specially introduced to deal with safety. No evaluation was 
given of the work of the inspector members of the staff for the 
mainline and divisions. It is annoying that these topics, 
important for safety, were omitted.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Lendov, GUDOK correspondent: "A Survey of the </F>
Anniversary Celebrant: Novosibirsk Is Mastering the Repair of 
Czech Locomotives"] 
  [Text] The plant came into being, that is, began to repair 
steam locomotives, in 1943. Evidence of this fact is an order by 
the Narkomat [People's Commissariat] of Railroads on starting up 
its operation somewhat later -- in April 1944. They worked, as 
everybody did at that time, for the front. The Novosibirsk 
workers had over 2,000 steam locomotives put in good order to 
their account when, in 1945, the plant changed its specialty and 
began to repair electric locomotives. 
  By its 50th anniversary, the plant had put back into 
operation over 6,000 electric locomotives of various series, and 
ten-fold more electric motors, and had manufactured 40,000 
locomotive wheelpairs. It made, of course, a great many other 
things: spare parts for locomotives, over a million tonnes of 
iron casting and 26,000 tonnes of non-ferrous casting, bridge 
supports and overhead wire-contact system suspension elements 
for electrification of the Transsiberian Railroad. NERZ 
[Novosibirsk Electric Locomotive Repair Plant] had done a great 
deal for the city, in particular, supplying the metal structures 
for bridges across the Ob and Berd and for the construction of 
subway and other facilities. 
  Today the electric locomotive repair plant is a modern 
enterprise, equipped with the newest high-productivity 
equipment. There is a robotized complex here, various 
semi-automatic machines, unique machine tools and flow lines and 
over 200 units of hoisting-transport machines. 
  One can add to the "survey" of the anniversary celebrants, 
the fact that NERZ has always had a reputation in Novosibirsk 
for paying close attention to the social sphere. Along with the 
plant wings, a whole small town has been built up (50 apartment 
houses with an area of 66,000 square meters), schools and 
child-care combines, a sports complex and stores, medical 
institutions and a hotel, a movie theater and a swimming pool. 
There is a subsidiary farm which has over 3,400 hectares of 
agricultural products. 
  I found all this out from the information prepared for the 
jubilee. V. Klimov, director of the plant, did not tell me a 
single word about the former achievements of the foremost 
collective in the sector. He is right now mainly occupied with 
the present state and the tomorrow of the enterprise, where 
about 2,500 people are working. 
  "We were the base enterprise for repair of the VL60 electric 
locomotive, practically the only one in the country," says 
Valeriy Mikhaylovich. "This series has been going on for 20 
years now. The Ministry and the Locomotive Main Administration 
asked us to help prolong the life of these machines by 10-15 
years. We did it, we modernized the locomotives, the bogie 
frames and the body." 
  But now the powerful enterprise, increasing its flowline 
production from year to year, has begun to slow down its chosen 
course: in 1993 it put 260 machines in good working order, in 
1994 it is looking at an order for 180 locomotives, and indeed 
may not even achieve these figures: there are fewer roads, and 
the fleet has decreased. A major buyer such as the Odessa 
Railroad (to this day, it owes the Siberians 340 million rubles 
[R]), for example, has found that it is now foreign -- so have 
the Central Asian and Tselina railroads. Besides, the VL60 is 
already highly obsolete, and all of these machines are going 
into the reserve. The electrification of the railroads, which 
provided quite a large additional amount of work, has also "gone 
off." Railcar brake shoes have begun to be cast at released 
"defense plant" sites, creating competition for the powerful 
NERZ casting shop. 
  These unpleasant surprises were not, to tell the truth, all 
that unexpected for the plant workers. They got used to looking 
ahead here, and foresaw the "thinned-down" portfolio of orders. 
As far back as 1992 the specialists began to think about how to 
repair OP units (diesel locomotive and electric locomotive 
sections combined in one vehicle) for the open-pit coal mines of 
the Kuzbass. In May the designers and technologists rolled up 
their sleeves, in September they began to develop the repair of 
bogies, in November the first unit stood in the bogie pit, and 
in February its repair was finished. Last year they provided 
sound "treatment" for eight of these machines, and are now doing 
twice as many. 
  "All the same," I address V. Klimov, "has this become an `I 
Spy' game for the plant, for after all, there are not all that 
many open-pit coal mines in the country, and they do not use 
these units at them everywhere?" 
  "In fact, this is not our main stake," noted Valeriy 
Mikhaylovich, "but it is still quite a help in difficult times. 
Since the plant changed our specialty in 1945 and 1965, why not 
take a new turn now? We simply must do it -- after all, it is a 
question of the plant's survival under the new conditions." 
  The market means producing goods which are in demand and 
will 
sell. On the Russian mainlines, where the freight transport 
volume is dropping for the time being, the need for passenger 
transport is growing, and this means the demand for passenger 
locomotives and their repair as well. These are mainly 
Czechoslovakian electric locomotives. The Novosibirsk workers 
are beginning to deal with them. The only plant to repair 
electric locomotives of the ChS series remained abroad -- in 
Zaporozhye. The MPS [Ministry of Railways] made a decision: the 
direct current ChS2 electric locomotives would be repaired in 
Yaroslavl, and the alternating current ChS4T -- in Novosibirsk. 
  It is not an easy matter to master the new machine and put 
it 
on the flowline. Moreover, the Novosibirsk workers are not 
planning to trifle with the job -- they intend to start capital 
plant repair immediately. Will they succeed? 
  A. Sysuyev, chief engineer, V. Tretyanykh, chief 
technologist, and the design and technological departments have 
set to work energetically. They have to sweat over it: there are 
not even any plant blueprints for these machines. The main 
administration helps here, of course, but they basically have to 
work it out themselves. As Valeriy Mikhaylovich aptly put it, 
the entire plant intellect has been activated, and all the 
specialists are working at tremendous tension. After all, it is 
not just a matter of preparing the equipment, machinery and 
documents. A number of shops have to be rebuilt: instrument, 
bogie and electric machinery shops. A number of sections have to 
be redesigned, several new ones have to be organized and the 
bogie pits in the assembly shop have to be lengthened. All this 
is being done without shutting down the production facility. 
  Beyond the rebuilding and technological problems, another 
very important problem has not been forgotten -- personnel 
training and instruction. The NERZ technologists, designers and 
electricians visited the electric locomotive depot at Kirov. It 
has a large fleet of passenger machines, and the Kirov workers 
mastered their repair together with Czech and Slovak 
specialists. The plant began to send workers there beginning in 
March. 
  "A precise plan was worked out," says V. Klimov. "In the 
first six months, we must master repair of electric motors, this 
is the main thing. The second -- we take on the first electric 
locomotive. The intention is to do at least 70-80 locomotives in 
1995. There is enough work: after all, about 450 ChS4T machines 
are in operation on the Gorkiy, Southeastern and Volga 
railroads. There are also over 250 ChS4 electric locomotives, as 
well as ChS2T. We're "stretching" to them. 
  "We hope," continued Valeriy Mikhaylovich, "to have our own 
share in servicing the Czech machines, which is organized in 
Yaroslavl. The possibility of our having to go to direct 
relations with Skoda for spare parts is not ruled out." 
  This is how our conversation about the anniversary of the 
Novosibirsk Electric Locomotive Repair Plant turned out. 
Incidentally, they devoted only one day to the celebration -- 
there is no time to slacken the pace. I have no doubt that at 
the end of the year I will go to NERZ to write a report that the 
plant has made its third change in specialty.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Davydov: "Situation is Complex But Under </F>
Control: From A Ministry of Railways Selector Conference"] 
  [Text] In opening yesterday's selector conference, Minister 
of Railways G.M. Fadeyev noted that, notwithstanding the 
increase in economic difficulties, the railroad workers of 
Russia are steadfastly carrying out the transporting of freight 
and passengers. This has been promoted to a large extent by the 
decisions adopted during the December and March expanded boards, 
the meeting of railroad chiefs with V.S. Chernomyrdin and also 
by the results of the regular assembly of railroad chiefs in 
Yekaterinburg, where basically new approaches were developed for 
solving a number of questions. 
  Certainly, the continuing decline in shipments and the 
inoperative payment mechanism are aggravating the status of the 
railroad workers. The minister stated that the situation is 
complicated and not under control and he appealed to all worker 
collectives to calmly and confidently implement the program as 
developed. The reference point is the same for everyone -- a 
wage agreement which must serve as a guide. In accordance with 
this agreement, the average branch wage in March will amount to 
approximately 291,000 rubles, that is, indexed by a factor of 
1.43 (according to the wage agreement -- 1.40). 
  Today's most urgent task -- to reduce expenses and increase 
income. The decisions handed down by the March board and the 
conclusions drawn by the assembly of railroad chiefs furnish 
specific recommendations in this regard. However, not all of the 
transport subunit commanders are coordinating their actions with 
these recommendations. It is sufficient to state that nine 
billion more rubles were paid out during the first quarter owing 
to the fact that some railroads had indexed their wages higher 
than the wage agreement. This applies first of all to the Far 
Eastern, West-Siberian, Kemerovo, Kuybyshev and Southeastern 
main lines. 
  Nor is full responsibility being displayed in all areas with 
regard to the implementation of another strategically important 
decision -- ensuring that the contingent of service personnel is 
in conformity with the true work volume. Compared to March of 
last year, the volume of shipments declined by 30 percent, while 
the work force increased by 16,000 individuals. This factor 
alone caused a loss of 22 billion rubles. In order to correct 
the situation, the number of people engaged in carrying out 
shipments must be increased by 14,000 by the end of the first 
quarter and by 45,000 before the end of the year. 
  The minister suggested that this could be achieved by 
utilizing the experience of the Moscow Railroad, where skilful 
use was made of the mechanism of a natural run-off of people. 
  The situation with regard to the payment of wages on the 
Trans-Baykal and BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line] railroads, where 
they are only beginning to cope with the indebtedness for 
February, has been evaluated as completely intolerable. Blame 
has been directed at the Sverdlovsk, Kemerovo and other freight 
railroads, which are handling their accounts with transit main 
lines in a very poor manner. The railroads owe approximately 16 
billion rubles to the collectives of our plants, as a result of 
which wages have not yet been issued even for December! 
  The first ruble earned must be used for wages, emphasized 
the 
minister and only later -- for remaining payments. 
Unfortunately, however, only 600 billion rubles of the 1.2 
trillion rubles' worth of March earnings were credited to income 
accounts. The remainder -- mutual credits and the output of 
enterprises. 
  In touching upon wage policy, the minister once again noted 
that the railroad workers are being forced to index wages, since 
the prices for the material resources, fuel and electric power 
being consumed by transport are increasing at excessive rates. 
The last indexing of passenger rates and the impending freight 
rates will in all probability make it possible to compensate for 
the first quarter losses, which reached 200 billion rubles. But 
the minister appealed for greater flexibility in this matter in 
the various areas. 
  It bears mentioning that the attraction of freight has been 
and remains the chief task confronting the railroad and branch 
leaders. In March, 14,000 more tonnes were loaded on the whole 
throughout the network than during February. But this, it goes 
without saying, was of little consolation. Approximately five 
million tonnes were declined and this was equivalent to a loss 
of 80 billion rubles! 
  During the selector conference, serious claims were 
addressed 
against the head of the Far Eastern Railroad for arbitrariness 
displayed in the handling of export freight. Because of him, 
high quality coal that had been paid for with currency, was 
burned in the boiler rooms of Valdivostock and Khabarovsk. 
  The losses caused by unprotected shipments continue to 
remain 
quite high and just as in the past the fines for delays in 
freight deliveries are considerable. 
  In summing up the discussion, the minister appealed to the 
railroad leaders to display greater initiative and to propose 
and adopt unique solutions that will have a positive effect upon 
the final result. The chief concern is the need for greater 
attention and specific work in the labor collectives. Without 
this there will be no improvement in the situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Arevik Arutyunyan: "Not Only Moral Victories"] </F>
  [Text] The garrison, which is located in one of the central 
regions of the capital, consists of volunteer units, people 
serving in the army on a voluntary basis. The volunteers are 
considered to be the best fighting men in the army. They are 
distinguished by their good organization and ability. They are 
capable of performing any combat mission with small forces, 
using a small amount of military equipment, and with minimal 
losses. No matter what you say, experience accumulated over the 
years plays its role. The majority of these boys, who responded 
to the first call to protect the Armenian borders and to go to 
Artsakh--are bonded to one another by strong friendship and have 
been tempered by the harsh experiences of war. They are the 
eagles of the Gayduk detachments who, recognizing the need for a 
regular army, at the end of 1992 entered into contractual 
service. There is no doubt that sometimes in the "detachment," 
group sentiments show through, but they do not seem to impede 
service in the army any more. 
  For many of the old volunteers the main thing is 
responsibility and self-sacrifice, and their families have 
already become accustomed to this. The same task of protecting 
the Armenian land from enemy encroachment during the last year 
and a half has brought dozens of men of various ages to the army 
to serve in it on a voluntary basis. But among those who have 
signed up as volunteers, obviously, the largest number are 
people who have been forced to take this step because of their 
difficult socioeconomic position, and they hoped to use their 
pay to feed their families. 
  The military unit leaves an infinitely sad impression. The 
barracks, built during the forties, are unattractive. The 
soldiers' uniforms are worn out and have holes in places. Soon 
they will replace people who are in combat positions, although 
it is apparent that they have not had a chance to rest properly. 
Wounded men who have not fully recovered and even certain 
Azatamart members who have been given certificates of disability 
will be sent there. Such is the life of the volunteers, which 
for many of them has gone on for six years now. By the admission 
of the commanders, certain of them are not fit for combat duty. 
  Understandably, a contract army is something new for us. But 
slowness and obvious incompetence in solving the most important 
problems here are simply unforgivable. 
  The contract system leaves the impression that it is a 
package of documents that has absolutely not been worked 
through. The volunteer signs a contract without having an 
opportunity to finally clarify his rights, responsibilities, and 
privileges. The commander is also left in confusion because his 
"rites" of command are not clear. Social problems--the miserly 
pay, uniforms, treatment, medications, apartments, family, and a 
multitude of other concerns--are constantly producing anxiety 
and disturbing the soldier. A sense of being unprotected follows 
him into combat positions as well, where he cannot feel at ease 
about his family, who are far away and have been cast to the 
will of fate. True, there is a certain edict from the president 
of the republic concerning privileges and benefits for families 
of deceased and wounded Azatamart members, soldiers who have 
participated in combat activities, which the president mentioned 
again literally a couple of days ago. But this involves such 
insignificant privileges and benefits that all this gives the 
impression of being nothing but a nice gesture. 
  And at the same time, problems are quite obvious in a 
contract army. If the objective is indeed to create a 
professional, well-trained army, then conditions generating an 
interest in the service become especially important here. 
Patriotic zeal can keep a soldier going only during the initial 
period of his service, and in unfavorable social conditions with 
time it gradually burns out, which is being felt even among the 
volunteers who are devoted to military service. Is it not 
surprising that even under conditions of ubiquitous unemployment 
and a helpless socioeconomic situation, people very rarely 
volunteer for military service? 
  There is no doubt that opportunities in Armenia are not 
great 
today, but one cannot say that there are absolutely no factors 
that provide incentive for service in the army. The volunteer 
who risks his life is offered an insignificant price in the 
material sense. But the soldier has a family and children, and 
to take care of them is also his permanent and sacred duty. 
  In Armenia today it is possible to buy an apartment, 
according to a modest calculation, for one day's revenue from a 
small store. Moreover, there are many apartments that actually 
belong to no one. At the same time many military servicemen who 
are protecting the homeland are living in dormitories and 
basements, under unfavorable conditions. At least this part of 
the army should be provided with apartments, and in general the 
provision of an apartment should be the best incentive for 
contract military service in Armenia. During the course of their 
service soldiers lose years when they could have been living in 
a different way. After service in the army it is exceptionally 
difficult to become accustomed to civilian life and to acquire a 
new specialty. And ultimately it is no secret that service in 
the army, especially in a war situation, to put it mildly, does 
not contribute to the development of intellectual capabilities. 
Sooner or later our military servicemen return home, but what 
will they do there? 
  This problem exists even today. Many volunteers are 
continuing their service simply because they do not see how they 
could make a living in this life, especially under conditions of 
a market economy, which are completely unknown and 
incomprehensible to them. In addition to material difficulties, 
in the future military servicemen will also experience 
psychological embarrassment and frustration. And a once strong, 
vital man gradually develops the feeling of inadequacy. There 
will be a new stratum in the society--superfluous people who 
have served and fought for anything but this. 
  High wages, an apartment, education--these are obviously 
important factors which could bring about competition among 
those who want to enter the army and thus stimulate the process 
of creating it. 
  In addition to the material incentive, there is also another 
important condition--state propaganda. Let us pay attention to 
the "respect" the soldier enjoys in Armenian reality. As 
distinct from the Soviet soldier, whom the people accepted into 
their homes as a native son, giving him warm hospitality 
everywhere, the Armenian soldier today meets with reproof and 
censure even when taking advantage of his right to free travel 
on city transportation. Moreover, the soldier's uniform has 
become somehow offensive to the eyes of those around him. 
Soldiers who are protecting their native land, cruel as it may 
be, are considered frivolous, rolling stones, somehow idle and 
limited people. 
  Herein lies one of the main reasons why people try to avoid 
service in the army, and this will continue as long as state 
propaganda is so far removed from the national ideology. 
  The temporary shelter for draftees into the army and 
reservists who have been called up for three months constitutes 
the same unknown quantity. They spend a month here, after which 
they are sent to a military training base. Without mentioning 
the failures of the first draft, one must say that this time 
there has been progress in the matter of organizing the daily 
life of the soldiers. The new uniforms are issued right away. 
Those people who are mobilized are fed three times a day and 
given the necessary nutritional norm. The bedding is clean and 
the bathing problem has been solved. There is always electricity 
in the military unit and the television sets work. Theoretical 
training lasts for one or two hours but practical training is 
inadequate because of the shortage of equipment. After noon 
those who wish to may leave the unit--under the condition that 
they return at a certain hour. Many prefer to stay in the unit 
where they can keep from getting bored. 
  So in the modern situation in Armenia the conditions created 
for military recruitment can without exaggeration be called 
favorable. The purpose of the active duty training is to 
familiarize men from 25 to 45 years of age with at least the 
fundamentals of military life and teach them to protect their 
native home. Obviously, this is a sacred task, but how have we 
prepared the most important thing for carrying it out--the 
training base? The military unit does not even have enough 
models of the most common weapons for instruction. There is only 
one firing range for target practice, and it is used by draftees 
from all seven regions of the capital. Firing practice is put 
off under the most diverse pretexts--on the first day the base 
is occupied, on the second day--the ordered transportation did 
not arrive, the next day--there are no cartridges. Cases like 
this exacerbate uncomplimentary ideas about the army, from the 
very first day of service weakening the vigilance and the 
composure of those who have been called into the army. We do not 
know what awaits people who have been mobilized into the army 
after a month, at the military training base. But if this kind 
of situation prevails here, the effectiveness of recruitment is 
greatly threatened. 
  We are not talking about questions of forms and methods of 
mobilization that flout human rights. Nor are we talking about 
the political objectives that are realized and the means that 
are applied, but as for elementary military training of the 
Armenian man--a most important and necessary matter of state 
importance--here we cannot close our eyes to the frivolous, 
antistate attitude toward this matter. 
  A former volunteer, speaking of the sad and difficult 
realities of the army, which, if they seem harmless and less 
than dangerous in the rear, become a cause of losses on the 
battlefield, noted sadly: "It is necessary to do something so 
that today's heroic battles are not regarded by future 
generations as mere moral victories."

<F P=106> [Interview with Gevorok Bagdasaryan, chairman of the </F>
Permanent Commission on Questions of Defense and Internal 
Affairs of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia, by 
Manvel Mkrtchyan; place and date not given: "If the Prestige of 
the Military Were High...."] 
  [Text] As we have learned, Mr. Bagdasaryan recently 
returned from the United States where some physicians who are 
our compatriots conducted a complicated heart operation on him. 
The operation was successful and now his condition is quite 
satisfactory. 
  [Mkrtchyan] Let us get one thing clear first: Was this form 
of recruitment agreed upon by the Ministry of Defense and your 
commission? Are you not afraid that recruitment using mass raids 
will compromise the very idea and increase the alarm in the 
society while simultaneously creating occasion for various legal 
infractions? 
  [Bagdasaryan] On 27 March of this year the government of the 
Republic of Armenia made a decision approving the list of 
officials not subject to being drafted for three-month active 
duty training. Everyone else, actually, by a decision of the 
government and the Ministry of Defense, is subject to the draft. 
But there is one "but" here.... The government is not 
coordinating all issues with the Supreme Council, particularly 
with our commission or the Commission on Legal Questions. And 
this is the reason mistakes have been made. I cannot say right 
now whether there are instructions granting military 
commissariats and the military police the right to arrange raids 
and other such actions. So far we have received no written 
protests from citizens to study them and set them in motion. We, 
like many others, learned about this from conversations with 
friends and acquaintances. According to these conversations 
there have been trading sessions on the spot, and in dollars or 
Russian rubles. Incidentally, there was a discussion of the 
aforementioned negative phenomena in the Presidium of the 
Supreme Council as well, but, I repeat, so far we have received 
no written complaints about the commission's orders. 
  By one of the resolutions adopted last year the Supreme 
Council made significant changes in the Law on Military Duty. 
They stipulate that if an individual with a military obligation 
does not show up at the military commissariat within three days 
after receipt of his notice, he may be held criminally liable. 
In other words, there is no need for additional notices or 
warnings. But, as we can see, the organizers of the raids have 
decided to take the shortest path. They decided not to wait 
until the draftees start evading the draft before they resorted 
to repressive measures in keeping with the law, but wanted to 
solve the problem at once, with the help of raids. I think that 
such forms of mobilization are unacceptable. 
  [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Bagdasaryan, let us take a look at the 
problem from the other side. As we know, the state minister for 
questions of defense, when summing up the results of the 
preceding recruitment, noted with satisfaction that when 
conducting it they managed to achieve extremely high indicators. 
The legitimate question arises: If it is possible to achieve 
such results using the structure of military commissariats, what 
brought about the use of such "unacceptable," as you put it, 
methods during the last conscription? 
  [Bagdasaryan] I find it difficult to answer this question 
and 
I can only give my personal opinion. We have lived through a 
difficult winter and some of our citizens are outside the 
republic. This probably explains why the Ministry of Defense 
resorted to extreme measures to provide for mobilization of the 
necessary number of reservists. 
  [Mkrtchyan] The present military-political situation shows 
that our state will be forced to conduct large-scale 
mobilizations in the future as well. What is the legal basis for 
conducting them and how good is it? 
  [Bagdasaryan] The law on military duty regulates all of 
these 
questions. It has a special chapter devoted to the reserve and 
it talks about both the time periods and rights of the draftee 
and about the social protection for his family and everything 
else. So far we have received no proposals to make an amendment 
to the law and so far we see not need to make it either stricter 
or more lenient. I repeat that we too are dissatisfied with the 
form in which it is conducted...so far that is all. 
  [Mkrtchyan] We assume that the reasons for the panic that 
arose during the time of the mobilization and the evasion of the 
service go much deeper than people sometimes try to indicate. In 
this case the most important task is to provide for a favorable 
social and political atmosphere, level of psychological 
preparation, etc. Frequently one gets the impression that state 
propaganda, especially on television, does not see this as its 
task. And one wonders whether this is intentional or the result 
of inability. How do you assess the activity of state propaganda? 
  [Bagdasaryan] The gap that formed after the fall of 
communist 
ideology is now being filled with whatever is at hand. There is 
no clear-cut state ideology that could fill the vacuum. Possibly 
this is the reason why many of our citizens, including in 
administrative positions, are lacking ideological approaches. In 
my opinion, this explains the panic that arose. If this gap were 
filled, say, with the national ideology of Gagerin Nzhde, I do 
not think that we would be seeing such phenomena. If the people 
had an awareness that every Armenian family must have one 
military serviceman, such a panic would not have existed. If the 
prestige of the military had been high, there would not have 
been this kind of panic at all. But to tell the truth, I find it 
difficult to accuse anybody of the situation that developed. It 
seems to me that we are all to blame. And I watch almost no 
television because of a lack of electricity.

<F P=106> [Article by Eldar Zeynalov: "Baku: Censorship and a </F>
Subsequent Search; The Press Is Dying in Azerbaijan. The 
Diagnosis Is That It Is Being Throttled"] 
  [Text] Baku--In civilized societies, the enemies of a 
regime are first given the last word and then sentenced. In 
countries with a chilly attitude toward the law, the ruling 
circles try to manage with the least amount of formalities and 
strive, primarily, to silence their enemies during a political 
struggle. The sacred: "There cannot be a pluralism of two 
opinions!" is apparently also the main slogan of the authorities 
in post-totalitarian Azerbaijan. 
  This naturally affects primarily the lot of free press 
pen-pushers. Since the beginning of the 1988 political upswing 
in Azerbaijan, I do not recall a single government which had 
loving feelings for them. The difference was only in the choice 
of means for putting pressure on the press. Whereas the "reds" 
with their taste for respectability, which had been developed 
during 70 years of power, preferred economic methods for 
throttling the press, the "democrats" clearly were in sympathy 
with simpler and more easily understood might-makes-right police 
methods of "education." 
  Life shows that the present government is actively using the 
"inheritance" of both its party and "democratic" predecessors 
using words disowning the "glorious" past. 
  The censorship -- both military, to which no one in warring 
Azerbaijan objects, and political -- which the "democrats" 
revived, was inherited from the People's Front. The latter type 
of censorship has not existed since last year's 9 December 
National Assembly decision; however, old acquaintances from the 
Main Administration for Protecting State Secrets in the Press 
are effectively rejecting "from stem to stern" any sharp 
opposition material. Even such articles as last year's report by 
Strobe Talbott to the U.S. Senate giving that country's official 
position towards Azerbaijan, the Amnesty International report on 
violations of human rights in the republic during 1992 (!) and 
even the press conference of Makhmud el-Said, the UN 
representative, go under the knife. 
  The last case, incidentally, is very typical in describing 
censorship methods. During the 16 February press conference, 
el-Said spoke against political censorship in reply to a 
"provocative" question from the AZADLYG newspaper of the 
Azerbaijan People's Front. However, the vigilant comrades -- the 
"defenders of state secrets" -- cut this section out. When the 
UN permanent representative, who had been away for several days 
on his own business, returned and beheld the white spot, he 
asked the newspaper for an explanation. Since censorship 
prudently selects both specimens of the newspaper mock-up 
presented to it and does not produce special documents about the 
text correction made by it, AZADLYG naturally was not able to 
show anything and el-Said, (a UN representative) probably from 
political considerations expressed dissatisfaction not with the 
censorship but... with the abridgment of his presentation. It 
turned out that the newspaper people themselves had abridged it, 
treading on the throat of somebody else's song. It was not very 
funny and a painful feeling remained that the notorious "world 
association" was deeply indifferent to the fate of a free press 
in Azerbaijan. 
  Beginning with the New Year and based on "aesthetic" tastes, 
the most zealous of the censors have forced the lines in an 
article subject to censorship to move further apart or the white 
spots to be filled with loyal articles. As one of them artlessly 
said: "You see, abroad they think that our censorship has no 
democracy." 
  Police oppression of newspapers, whose apogee was the 
dashing 
adventures of I. Gamidov, the minister of internal affairs, and 
his beating of "guilty" editors with his own hands, resumed only 
quite recently. True, V. Novruzov, the present minister, does 
not condescend to a visit by journalists; however, his 
subordinates have already begun to inflict "courtesy visits." 
Thus, on 19 February, the police deigned to look over a file of 
bulletins from the independent TURAN information agency, after 
which a wordy dressing-down went from the police to Mekhman 
Aleyev for "anti-government propaganda" (a quotation from an 
interview with ex-president A. Mutalibov by one of the Russian 
newspapers was the spark that lighted the fire). 
  On 1 March, a search, which provided no results but which, 
on 
the other hand, frustrated the production of articles, was made 
in the building where this agency and the editorial board of the 
AZADLYG newspaper are located. The next day, the police 
organized a true pogrom in the editorial board of the TYURKYUN 
YOLU newspaper, which is not very well known. Having broken the 
windows, the police entered the premises and search them, after 
which they carried off the metal plates required for offset 
printing, a typewriter, a press, and dies. 
  It comes down to the fact that the police are hindering the 
correspondents' work. For example, on 19 February Yadigar 
Mametli and Ali Khaziguliyev, employees of the Azerbaijan 
People's Front information center, who had come for a meeting of 
the opposition, were subjected to administrative arrest; later, 
this also fell to the lot of Khalid Askerov, a REUTER 
correspondent. On 9 March, 10 correspondents were not admitted 
to a press conference by Abulfaz Elchibey, ex-president and 
leader of the Azerbaijan People's Front, in the Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic. If one looks at last year, 26 of the 33 
journalists, who were victims in 1993, were persecuted during 
the period of the new authorities. 
  Even the recent re-registration of members of Azerbaijan's 
Union of Journalists took the shape of a political act: New 
membership cards were issued only to those journalists who were 
in the organization prior to 1990 (that is, during the communist 
period). 
  However, the main methods of the new authorities are 
undoubtedly economic ones. After the only newspaper publishing 
house, AZERBAYDZHAN, was transferred to the jurisdiction of the 
president's staff in view of certain derelictions in its work, 
such openly opposition newspapers as MUKHALIFYAT, KHYURRIYYAT, 
YENI MUSAVAT, 525-DZHI GAZET, DZHUMKHURIYYAT, AZAD SEZ, and 
PRESSFAKT have been able to publish only a few times in 1994 and 
some -- not at all. The reason was a decision of the publishing 
house's new board that the newspaper editorial boards themselves 
should supply the paper and metal plates for the offset 
printing. These had previously been supplied centrally. 
  The recent case involving the independent press distribution 
Gaya firm is at the junction of the genres, that is, of the 
police and economic measures used to throttle the press. As its 
director, Matanat Aliyeva, reported, police officials smashed a 
kiosk belonging to the firm on 17 March and unmercifully beat 
the invalid kiosk-keeper for selling the satirical CHESHMA 
newspaper which had a caricature of the minister of internal 
affairs (later, it turned out that it had been published in a 
different newspaper with the same name). Soon after this 
happened, M. Aliyeva's apartment was subjected to a search not 
authorized by the procurator and editions of objectionable 
newspapers were confiscated. The next day, the police blockaded 
the operation of all Gaya kiosks. In general, there was no 
discussion of indemnification for the losses; on the contrary, 
financial control bodies were set against the firm. 
  In M. Aliyeva's opinion, the persecution of the firm, which 
began its activities recently, has the goal of throttling the 
embryonic alternative to the Gasid state firm (the former 
Soyuzpechat), whose work is evoking much unfavorable criticism, 
especially from the editorial boards of opposition newspapers. 
  Persistent discussions about a certain "newspaper mafia" are 
circulating in journalistic circles. By printing additional 
editions of the most popular newspapers and illegally selling 
them through Gasid newsstands, it is earning large sums (besides 
selling cigarettes and other similar commodities through these 
kiosks). It would be different if they had to pay the editors 
for the returned copies, of which there are more, naturally, 
with the increased circulation. According to the version of 
certain editors, the government winks at these tricks, first, 
because economic harm is being inflicted on the popular (that 
is, independent or opposition) newspapers and, second, because 
Gasid, as journalists and readers have pointed out, has been 
used in a number of cases for the purpose of not distributing 
some newspaper or other by failing to deliver it to rayons that 
actively "read" or hiding it under the counter. It makes no 
difference that the kiosk-keepers hold their own in Snickers and 
cigarettes and must pay the editors for the losses. 
  As a result of the situation that has taken shape, only 225 
(now, probably even less) of the total number of approximately 
700 press publications registered on 1 January have published. 
Because of the increase in prices for newspapers and magazines, 
the number of subscribers has decreased by 57 percent and 66 
percent, respectively, 
  Is it advantageous for the government to throttle the press? 
Judging from the results of a public opinion survey conducted at 
the end of January in Baku and Sumgait, 75 percent of those 
surveyed preferred to obtain their information from television 
whereas 39.1 percent preferred it from newspapers, 10.1 percent 
-- from radio, and 4.8 percent -- from magazines. 
  By keeping television under control (R. Guliyev, the speaker 
of parliament, recently assured us that there will not be an 
opposition broadcast before a new nation-wide television channel 
is opened, i.e., until there is a blue moon), the government can 
form public opinion in an optimum manner for itself. 
  Incidentally, television broadcasts have recently been 
reduced by two hours "because of economic considerations." 
Observant journalists have pointed out that the reduction 
affected Iranian broadcasts after they showed ex-president 
Mutalibov, who is hated by the authorities, at a time when the 
multi-hour British Super Channel remains inviolable. 
  The journalists, however, do not intend to surrender. In 
this 
connection, the anecdote about the "decadent intellectual" is 
recalled. An intellectual is travelling in an overcrowded bus. 
At each turn, a slightly tipsy ruffian, who reacts rudely to 
every comment by the intellectual with a "Stop your whining!" 
falls against him. The intellectual waits until his stop, exits 
and, after the doors have closed, shouts with feeling: "But I 
will continue to whine, on principle I will whine!" 
  Azerbaijan's non-governmental journalists are just as 
inclined in principle. They have still not forgotten "samizdat" 
habits and have already tasted freedom. In any case, however, 
they will find a way to express their "sour" words.

<F P=106> [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA interview with Foreign Affairs </F>
Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze: "The Geopolitical Position Is 
Unchanging.... A Talk With the Foreign Affairs Minister of the 
Republic of Georgia"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
A state delegation headed by Foreign Affairs Minister 
Batoni [a term of respect in reference to or addressing a male] 
Aleksandre Chikvaidze returned to Tbilisi from Tehran on 19 
February. In addition to the official visit to Iran, the 
Georgian delegation paid a working visit to the capital of 
Azerbaijan. 
  These days, when almost every basic priority of 
Georgia's foreign policy is developing dynamically, the official 
visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran was especially meaningful 
and important in many respects. 
  [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, your trip to Tehran and 
Baku is the first as Foreign Minister since Boris Yeltsin's 
official visit to Georgia. Why Baku and Tehran? Does it carry 
some specific import? 
  [Chikvaidze] Indeed it does. Boris Yeltsin's recent visit 
closed the regional circle of Georgia's foreign policy, in a 
sense--that is, it gives final balance to our relations with 
neighboring countries. Defining relationships has put many 
hitherto unsolved problems and puzzles with the Russian 
Federation in their logical place and made it much easier to 
establish contacts with other states in our region on a calmer 
and more reasoned basis. Hence, our official visit to Iran and 
our working visit to Azerbaijan are in keeping with this 
specific context. It begins an important stage of improved 
relations and deeper cooperation. A vigorous regional policy is 
a top priority of Georgia's foreign policy, because we remain a 
regional-scale country which can get organically involved in 
"big politics" only by implementing an intensive regional policy. 
  [Correspondent] Batono Minister, before Tehran you went to 
Baku. What prompted the visit, and what was there of interest in 
it? 
  [Chikvaidze] Our delegation had the chance to pay a one-day 
working visit to the capital of Azerbaijan. The fact is that 
Georgia and Azerbaijan face almost identical problems at this 
point in history. So we have a lot to talk about and share. One 
might say that the Georgian delegation's stay in Baku went 
beyond the bounds of an ordinary working visit. We had a 
lengthy, meaningful, and fruitful talk with Azerbaijan's Foreign 
Minister Hasan Hasanov (incidentally, he grew up in Tbilisi and 
speaks excellent Georgian). His wife is Georgian too. We 
discussed a broad range of international and regional problems. 
We talked about the extreme escalation of armed conflicts in 
Transcaucasia. We agreed to step up joint efforts with respect 
to collective security in the framework of the CIS. 
  Most important, I met with Azerbaijan's President Heydar 
Aliyev. We talked about the quadrilateral meeting initiated by 
Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze to settle the conflicts in 
Transcaucasia, with Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia 
taking part. As was to be expected, Heydar Aliyev met the 
Georgian Head of State's initiative with enthusiasm. We agreed 
that implementing the idea would be a big step toward 
normalizing the situation in the region. At the end of our talk, 
I conveyed to Batoni Aliyev Eduard Shevardnadze's official 
invitation to visit Georgia, and he accepted it with pleasure. 
  [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, was our delegation's 
official visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran prompted by any 
specific factors, and if so what can you tell us about them? 
  [Chikvaidze] I told you when we started talking, and I will 
repeat it now, that a qualitatively new stage has begun in 
Georgia's foreign policy, or, rather, the implementation of its 
priorities. The present system of international relations is a 
reality for the whole world; it began to take shape after World 
War II and has been undergoing very important transformations 
before our very eyes. Time has also brought it about that 
Georgia also has a place in this world order. Clearly and 
specifically determining this place and purpose constitutes the 
chief task of Georgia's recent foreign policy, the basic 
direction of our efforts and analysis. 
  Our single point of departure is this: Georgia's 
geopolitical 
position remains unchanging; it cannot be affected in any way by 
any change in the system of international relations. Georgia has 
always been and still remains on the border between West and 
East, which is a very important factor despite the fact that the 
traditional anxiety of that confrontation has been somewhat 
alleviated these days. The logical conclusion, then, is that the 
influence of our big neighbors' short-term and long-term 
interests on little Georgia's domestic and foreign policy is a 
clearly marked and permanent political process. This is an 
indisputable fact, and so I think that our foreign policy's 
prime characteristic has to be balance and, as far as possible, 
take account of the set of interacting factors which define our 
actual geopolitical position. I took this brief theoretical 
excursion in order to emphasize the elementary truth that 
Georgia's permanent, unflagging interest toward Iran is what you 
have called the factors that prompted our official visit. These 
factors will always exist, just as the objective necessity of 
bilateral relations between Iran and Georgia will always exist. 
Add to that the realities that have taken shape through the 
centuries and you get a picture of the extreme necessity of an 
impeccable regional policy. It is in our future interest to have 
close relations with Iran--political, economic, cultural, and 
general. This is why relations between the Republic of Georgia 
and the Islamic Republic of Iran have been characterized by 
special intensity since November 1991. 
  [Correspondent] Batono Minister, what can you tell us 
specifically about your visit? 
  [Chikvaidze] Iran's Foreign Minister, Batoni Ali Akbar 
Velayeti [transliterated], visited Tbilisi last spring. So now I 
paid a return official visit to Tehran, and the visit had an 
objective of specific import. 
  The Iranians welcomed us with a very intensive, packed 
program. We visited Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Akbar Velayeti 
the first day. We spent almost two hours talking about a broad 
range of current political problems. We talked about many urgent 
issues of Iranian-Georgian bilateral relations and explored many 
pleasant prospects. Naturally, our focus was on major problems 
of regional security and normalization of the situation in 
Transcaucasia. It is a pleasure to report that Iran's top 
political leaders have complete and objective information about 
our problems, and, what's more, Iran's Islamic Mejlis 
[Parliament] has a functioning Friends of Georgia group. 
  On 16 February I met with Iran's President, His Excellency 
Hashemi Rafsanjani. I presented him with a personal letter from 
Georgia's Head of State. We had a very interesting talk, and the 
President gratefully accepted Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze's 
official invitation to Georgia. 
  I mentioned above that our program was a packed one. We met 
with all the ministers in the field of economics and the Vice 
Speaker of the Islamic Mejlis. Very soon, many prospects will 
become a reality. We agreed to create a joint economic 
commission in the first half of 1994. We can say, then, that the 
visit was a success. 
  [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, at the beginning of our 
interview you said that the visit to Tehran is in keeping with 
the specific context of regional policy, and you linked that to 
Boris Yeltsin's visit. Could you give us more details? 
  [Chikvaidze] During our talk with Iran's President it became 
very clear that creating the legal base for relations with 
Russia was truly an urgent necessity for us. Rafsanjani stated 
directly that he welcomed the improvement of Georgian-Russian 
bilateral relations. What's more, Iran will encourage further 
development of relations with Russia. The President believes 
that tension between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Georgia has a direct and negative influence on the situation in 
the region, and Iran can't help being concerned. 
  [Correspondent] Batono Minister, there has been a lot of 
talk 
about Iran's possible support in supplying natural gas. Was 
there any discussion of that during your visit? 
  [Chikvaidze] I spoke about that to the Foreign Minister and 
the President in the name of our Head of State. We reached an 
agreement by which we will be supplied with one billion cubic 
meters of gas from Iran; this is to be done on the basis of a 
long-term and very favorable agreement. The Iranians' support is 
due to Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze's prestige. "We will give 
maximum support to Shevardnadze's Georgia," President Rafsanjani 
stated at the end of our talk.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of the </F>
economy, by Tatyana Korostikova, under the rubric "Projection"; 
place and date not given: "Prices Will Grow by a Factor of Five"] 
  [Text] Early this year the Ministry of the Economy 
offered the government several scenarios of the development of 
the economic situation in Russia--what will happen: if 
everything is left as is, if credit is given to everyone, if 
nothing is given to anyone, and so on. We asked First Deputy 
Minister of the Economy Yakov Urinson to discuss the scenario 
preferred by the government. 
  [Urinson] Our government has resolved to continue a quite 
stringent financial course and reinforce financial discipline at 
the same time, because on one hand we have tremendous 
nonpayments, while on the other, enterprises keep a lot of spare 
funds in accounts at commercial banks, and pay taxes poorly. 
  The government suggests that the following be done: If an 
enterprise cannot pay with money, let it draw up a bill of 
exchange. If it does not pay on the bill of exchange either, 
then let it pay with its property, that is, go bankrupt. At 
present about 30 percent of our production facilities are 
unprofitable. It would be normal if we could shut down 5 percent 
of enterprises before the end of the year. 
  If we succeed in making the recession structural (helping 
the 
best and giving the worst an opportunity to quietly close down) 
production will decline by no more than 12 percent during the 
year. Prices will calm down, too. In February they increased by 
10 percent, in March--by 8.7 percent. If we could hold on for 
another month, interest on credit would also go down. At present 
it is 210 percent. It could be brought to 100-120 percent. As 
soon as interest on credit goes down, capital investment will 
appear. 
  Given the policy for which the government has opted, we 
project a growth of prices in 1994 by a factor of five (in 
1993--by a factor of 10). It will come to 7-8 percent per month. 
People will already be able to plan their budgets. 
  I think that the exchange rate of the dollar will reach 
3,000 
rubles [R]. Since subsidies are not expected, it will slowly 
creep upward. 
  [Korostikova] How many unemployed will we have? How do you 
expect to help them? 
  [Urinson] There will 3.5-4 million people. At present there 
are 1.2 million. It has already been one year since unemployment 
benefits were introduced. However, it would be better for people 
to have something to do. This is why we allocated funds for 
retraining (during this period people will receive scholarships 
and adapt). 
  We will employ people for public works. Small businesses are 
the third area in which I see tremendous reserves. We have 
proposed tax relief for small businesses and have provided for a 
little money in the budget to support newcomers. 
  However, the unemployment problem must be tackled not only 
at 
the federal level. The local authorities better know the 
situation and the way out of it. By law, they can resolve to 
grant relief from local taxes or introduce new taxes. 
  [Korostikova] Incidentally, about taxes. Will they be 
revised? 
  [Urinson] I believe that they will not be revised by any 
means this year. First we need to create a powerful and at the 
same time refined mechanism for the tax system. Our system is 
now as crude as an axe. However, let it remain unchanged until 
we develop a new one and kick it around in the parliament every 
which way. Rules cannot be changed before the game is over. When 
the new system is adopted, it should be laid down in the law: No 
changes for five years under any circumstances. 
  [Korostikova] However, everyone who engages in production 
assures us that it is impossible to operate because of high 
taxes. 
  [Urinson] They are inclined to exaggerate the tax pressure 
here. In 1993 withholdings of all types for the consolidated 
budget of the state came to about 42 percent of the gross 
domestic product (GDP) of Russia. What is the state of affairs 
in other countries? In the United States the corresponding 
parameter comes to approximately 35 percent, in Japan--38 
percent, and in Germany, almost 50 percent. Therefore, not only 
our tax burden is heavy. However, the outrage here is greater 
than in any other country because everybody, especially a 
segment of directors of state enterprises, wants to shift the 
responsibility for their miscalculations (and resulting high 
costs) onto the state. Besides, many entrepreneurs operate on 
the principle "cry harder, tears bring you better luck at cards!" 
  [Korostikova] Could it be that everything is not that 
simple? 
Recently I needed to find a new wave entrepreneur-industrialist, 
not a state enterprise director. This turned out to be 
difficult. They are few and far between. 
  [Urinson] Ninety percent of our economy consisted of 
producers. However, we produced guns, tanks, meat, 
and butter rather than services. There is one 
take-out kitchen per 100 residential buildings, and one laundry 
per 1,000 of them. It is precisely in the service sector that 
the shortage is the greatest. For this reason, financial, legal, 
consulting, and consumer services are most profitable at present. 
  They say that our trade sector is overgrown. Meanwhile, its 
contribution to GDP is smaller than in any other country, even a 
not-too-developed one. Clearly, the capital streamed to the 
sector, and profits are the highest there. Once the trade sector 
has been saturated, profits will begin to increase in 
production, and more goods manufacturers will appear. 
  [Korostikova] Nonetheless, the state collects a good deal of 
money from us. However, we do not have any idea how it is spent. 
This is why one kind of expenditure is specified in the budget, 
while the money, to put it mildly, is not spent in the intended 
way. 
  [Urinson] A powerful, professional, and depoliticized 
parliament is the only means of genuine control over budgetary 
expenditures. 
  [Korostikova] Does the current parliament fit the bill? 
  [Urinson] Of course, there are people there such as 
Pochinok, 
Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, Zadornov, Petrakov, Fedorov. One cannot 
deceive them. On the whole, however.... I have spoken before the 
old parliament and before this one. In the previous one, one out 
of 10 questions was expert and normal; in this parliament, as 
many as three are. However, this is what I see: The further we 
go, the more politics, playing to the gallery, and fueling of 
passions there is, and the less punctilious interest in each 
number. 
  I have attended the proceedings of the French parliament. 
Nobody discusses over there whether you are in favor of the 
Whites or the Reds. They take a puny statistic--expenditures for 
whatever--and begin to kick it around every which way. Either a 
deputy prime minister or a deputy minister of finance makes a 
presentation. He is questioned for two hours about a number that 
is one-hundredth of the budget! This goes on for two weeks. 
Following this, absolutely the entire budget is as transparent 
as can be. 
  In the process, the press continuously covers who said what 
about the number under discussion and what the consequences are 
going to be if they act in a particular way. As a result, people 
are better versed in budget statistics. 
  [Korostikova] Do you think that our economy has already 
reached the bottom of its fall? 
  [Urinson] I think that this will happen sometime in the 
middle of the year. It will be possible to talk about 
stabilization only after inflation stays at 5-7 percent a month 
for no less than 10 months, only when the recession is put in 
order--not all enterprises will shut down, only the bad ones, 
and most importantly, only when natural investment begins rather 
than the coercive investment we see at present, that is, when 
our enterprises begin to invest funds in the development of 
production rather than exchange rubles into foreign currency. 
Then a pickup in the economy will begin.

<F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy by unidentified </F>
correspondent, date and place not given; first three paragraphs 
are introduction: "Everything Begins with an Economic Agreement. 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy Answers Questions from the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
Editorial Board"] 
  [Text] Requesting him to express his opinion regarding 
Nazarbayev's proposal on the creation of a Eurasian Union, we 
remembered that in the recent past Grigroiy Yavlinskiy more than 
once was a first-hand participant in the preparation of 
multilateral economic agreements between the republics of the 
USSR. For the first time the idea of a similar agreement was 
presented as a section of the "500 Days" program in August 1990. 
At that time Kryuchkov, Pavlov and Abalkin succeeded in 
convincing Gorbachev that such coordinated action of the 
republics would deprive him of real political power. This 
became the main reason for Gorbachev's rejection of the "500 
Days" program. 
  The second attempt was undertaken after the August 1991 
putsch. In October of 1991 an all-encompassing agreement was 
worked out which ten republics of the former USSR signed. 
During the course of working on it, 25 specific economic 
agreements were prepared--on monetary and financial policy, a 
customs area, free trade, migration, social issues, 
extraordinary situations, etc. 
  However, the extemely sharp political strugge at that stage 
overshadowed any kind of economic expediency. The agreement, 
which was not successfully implemented then, is today the 
foundation of the organization of an economic union. 
  [Question] Nazarbayev's proposal, expressed during his 
Moscow 
visit, sounded unexpected for many people. For you too? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Nazarbayev is the kind of leader who 
politically 
understands economic processes. His position always proceeds 
from the interests of the matter, and not from ambition. It is 
precisely why in 1991 he supported in every way possible the 
work on creating an economic union, he always strove to act not 
as a destroyer, but as a creator. That is why the Kazakh 
president's statement did not strike me as unexpected. 
  [Question] Nazarbayev's proposal detailed such features as a 
unified economic space, a common parliament and a defense union. 
How much do you share his specific proposals? 
  [Yavlinskiy] It has at first the intent of reestablishing an 
economic union on the basis of that which was already worked 
out. When the economic union begins to yield positive results, 
then it is possible to discuss other elements. 
  [Question] What time frame do you see for this process? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The union is first of all a common market. This 
should result in a viable working condition during 1994. The 
main obstacle to this is the long known disregard toward 
integration tendencies on the part of many of our "reformers." 
Let's recall, for example, Gaydar's use of the process of 
unifying the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus as one of 
the grounds for his resignation. 
  [Question] In the last issue of our newspaper we published 
an 
interview with Shakhray, where he was in some measure a follower 
of Nazarbayev's idea. 
  [Yavlinskiy] Sergey Mikhaylovich united himself with this 
idea because the more supporters it has, the better. But we 
must not forget that earlier he spoke out very fervently against 
an economic agreement. Now it seems that supporting an economic 
agreement has become politically beneficial, it is delightful. 
  [Question] How do you evaluate the prospects of support and 
rejection of Nazarbayev's proposal by Russia's political elite? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Nazarbayev makes such statements because he was 
always a consistent supporter of the idea of integration. As 
regards politicians from other states, in Russia, for example, 
it is not simple for all of them to move away from their former 
positions. This, in my view, explains Moscow's silence 
following Nazarbayev's statement. 
  [Question] What do you think about the positions of other 
states of the Commonwealth? 
  [Yavlinskiy] It's not necessary to think about Belorussia 
[Belarus]: the desire for integration is very strong there. In 
Ukraine all the elections revolve around this question. There 
Grinev and Kuchma support the position of drawing closer. True, 
there are opponents. As far as I know, in Armenia, Tajikistan, 
Kyrgyzstan and in other states they are looking for various ways 
to get closer to this idea. 
  [Question] As a result of the disintegration, a large circle 
of leaders has come to power who in essence advocated this idea. 
Today evidently the striving for unification is the wish, 
perhaps, of every stratum of society. Does this mean that this 
most recent idea will triumph in reality only after all the 
actors are replaced? 
  [Yavlinskiy] In any case it would be desirable if the 
politicians who support integration processes were sincere and 
no one would be able to reproach them for the state of affairs. 
It seems to me that in the end, the essence of support for 
Nazarbayev's proposal is not in the words which I am now saying 
in this interview, but in this, apparently, I can add myself to 
those people who prepared popular opinion for integration.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Deputy Premier Aleskandr </F>
Shokhin by unidentified OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, date and 
place not given: "How I See this Newspaper"] 
  [Text] 
  [Question] You were the first one who supported OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA's initiative to create a CIS international publication. 
It was precisely at the session of the Consultative Committee 
that the formulation about organizing the economic weekly SNG: 
OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: COMMON MARKET] based on OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
was adopted. Why did you support this idea? 
  [Shokhin] The CIS institutes are still not working 
effectively, particularly due to lack of professional 
technology, first of all information technology. Such 
operational information on the situation in each of the 
countries which it is now possible to receive is insufficient. 
In addition, meetings on a bilateral and multilateral basis 
often arise but the large apparatus of state employees and 
business people who, according to their activity should be privy 
to these mutual relations, do not have reliable sources of 
information. Of course, a newspaper cannot be the only source 
and we are trying to create other systems, particularly computer 
systems for exchanging information. But if an economic weekly 
were published, which knew how to give professionals not only 
food for thought but also for action, I think that would be a 
big step toward real strengthening of our mutual action. 
  [Question] Of course, the features of a newspaper take shape 
gradually. But it is already possible to determine its basic 
direction. First of all it is a comparative analysis of the 
situation in one country to another according to various 
parameters. 
  [Shokhin] It must be said that if a comparative economic 
analysis can be introduced successfully as one of the basic 
ideas of the newspaper that would be excellent. If we know how 
to give a professional analysis and the corresponding prognosis 
on various themes, be they banking affairs, financial 
management, the consumer basket, inflation, etc., the newspaper 
would be able to exert a strong influence on life. 
  [Question] Does possible jealousy not embarrass you? 
  [Shokhin] So as not to use politicized terminology, it is 
possible with a comparison of a specific set of economic policy 
measures and an evaluation of their short, medium and long-term 
consequences to prove of great use to our colleagues and 
neighbors, rather than by pinning on labels. If an element of 
envy enters the professional channel then it will not be an 
element of envy but rather a moment of truth, which leaders need. 
  [Question] One of the basic directions of the new 
publication 
should be integration in the broadest sense of the word: from 
economic union, ensuring a unified economic space, free movement 
of goods, services and capital to the reestablishment of 
traditional economic ties and the search for new companions. 
What can the new weekly do that can be useful in developing this 
process? 
  [Shokhin] The very name of the newspaper already proposes 
that it should propagandize four freedoms: the freedom for 
movement of capital, work forces, services and goods. Now, when 
we are trying to build a program of practical steps, not just as 
the basis for these freedoms, but also for their practical 
realization, it is important to understand the consequence of 
these actions. The matter is that even on the highest political 
level the plans on how to proceed toward economic union have not 
been charted. At one time a somewhat simplified approach 
prevailed. It was enough to display political decisiveness and 
everything would be reestablished. Now it is clear that to 
reestablish economic links and to remove barriers which have 
appeared in recent years is more easily done through the 
resolution of specific questions than through universal outlines. 
  It would be desirable if the newspaper could help strengthen 
production links between potential partners. Here is an 
additional field of activity for the paper. The search for 
partners and the corresponding propaganda can give an additional 
impulse to this work: the newspaper should not rely on the 
budget all the time. It should become self-supporting. 
  [Question] The state of economic and ecological 
fragmentation 
tragically affects the problems, the resolution of which is 
possible only through common efforts. How can the newspaper 
help here? 
  [Shokhin] I cannot say that these general state projects are 
not found in the field of vision of the CIS governments. There 
is the Caspian, and there is Chernobyl. It is impossible to say 
that they are being resolved effectively. It is difficult to 
say to what decree the newspaper is able to help them. More 
likely, by mobilizing various types of resources, inasmuch as it 
is impossible to resolve these problems solely on the basis of 
state financing. For example, we have the Yelabug project; the 
agreement on creating an interstate consortium was signed a year 
ago and the CIS countries are participating. If the newspaper 
could attract the most varied investors, or foreign 
capital...Perhaps there could be a possibility to hold a contest 
for interstate projects. The newspaper could draw attention to 
these projects and help decide them. 
  [Question] What kind of readers do you see for the new 
newspaper? 
  [Shokhin] I think that a certain stratum of state employees 
has already formed which handles the problems of the CIS. The 
population is also interested in knowing what is happening in 
interstate relations. I think that Russian businessmen should 
know what investment conditions exist outside the borders of 
Russia, in the near abroad, how to protect their capital 
investments there, and so forth. The newspaper could be an 
irreplaceable source of such information. I hope that it will 
really become one of the first international newspapers, 
although several publications are contending for this title with 
us.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikita Kirichenko, Aleksandr Privalov and Andrei </F>
Sharov: "Shokhin Has the Opportunity to Become the Hercules of 
the Russian Stables"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  There Is No Rebuke In My Letter, And I Had All Of You In Mind </H5>
  On Monday, 14 March, Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin took 
a small document of 9 typed pages to the prime minister. The 
subject of this document was the economy ministry's new 
prognosis for the development of the Russian national economy in 
1994. On Friday the little document was already officially sent 
to the government apparatus for discussion within the council of 
ministers and for further submission to the Duma. 
  We would not be talking about the materials of the economy 
ministry in such detail and so personally had it not been for 
one circumstance: the new prognosis by the ministry marks out 
all preceding computations presented by Viktor Chernomyrdin at a 
council of ministers meeting on 4 March in terms of predictions 
for both the economy and the budget. Moreover, the conclusions 
that arise from the new prognosis regarding the need to correct 
the budget may create fairly acute intrigue within the 
government. 
  The fact is that the economy ministry's old, December, 
prognosis predicted an industrial downturn of 7 percent in 1994 
as compared to 1993. The finance ministry calculated its budget 
based on this data. More precisely, it calculated not the entire 
budget, but the income portion; it thought up the expenditure 
portion on its own, without coordinating with the economics 
ministry. This lack of coordination resulted in the fact that 
centralized capital investments into the budget turned out to be 
smaller than those which the economics ministry used to create 
its prognosis. Thus, it turned out that the old prognosis and 
the draft budget did not coincide. 
  But let us note that the old prognosis was composed by Yegor 
Gaydar, who left the government in an untimely manner. The new 
prognosis by Aleksandr Shokhin, who is more sober in his 
assessments, turned out to be less optimistic. According to the 
latest ministry calculations, the downturn will equal 12 percent 
at best and 20 percent at worst. 
  Twenty versus 7 is considerable, quite considerable. This is 
why the lack of agreement between the budget and the prognosis, 
which was noticeable in the old prognosis as well, becomes 
readily apparent. It is completely clear that such unbalanced 
documents, once they reach the Duma (according to a government 
resolution, both the budget and the prognosis are sent to the 
Duma), will not be left untouched by Aleksandr Pochinok. Who 
will be given the axe? 
  We think it will be Aleksander Shokhin rather than Sergei 
Kubinits, and here is why. First of all, Shokhin will pay for no 
real reason, just as the bearer of bad tidings. After all, the 
pessimistic variant of the economy ministry's prognosis looks 
more like the truth, no matter how sad this is. It may be noted, 
incidentally, that it corresponds fully to KOMMERSANT's 
calculations, although they were made using a different 
methodology. Secondly, according to Shokhin, it is the 
monetarists who are firing volleys from the main guns, since the 
economy ministry's new prognosis states simply and honestly that 
the drift in the direction of a lesser downturn is possible only 
by means of deficit financing of supplementary centralized 
capital investments, and, consequently, greater inflation. If 
the anti-inflation pathos reaches the hearts of Duma members, 
then the government may sacrifice Shokhin. What remains for him? 
This week he will have to choose one of two alternatives. 
  The first alternative involves pushing a few buttons on his 
pocket calculator to perform a trick with the prognosis by 
increasing the VVP [Gross domestic product] deflator and by 
adjusting financial indicators in the prognosis to correspond to 
the budget's computation base. In this case the budget deficit 
does not increase, Shokhin and Dubinin slobber all over 
themselves, remain in the Duma until death, having disgraced 
those of little faith and having acquired approval of the 
proposed documents. All of this is well and good, but for the 
national economy this means an even greater downturn than the 
predicted 20 percent, since, because of the increase in the 
deflator, real investments will turn out to be much less. 
  The second alternative for Shokhin is to cross himself, 
stick 
to his budget variant and hope to drum up some large investment 
while repudiating the budget. 
  According to KOMMERSANT experts, it is somehow inappropriate 
to have an economy minister (any minister, whether Shokhin or 
not) perform tricks with the deflator, like Bulgakov's Woland. 
It is especially inappropriate to do this now, when the 
situation in the economy smells more and more of "gasoline"; 
something must be done quickly. 
<H5>  The Gasoline That It Smells Of Is Already Produced </H5>
Spontaneously 
  In general, any inhabitant of Russia will willingly confirm 
the fact that the situation in the Russian economy demands not 
just decisive action but some sort of qualitatively-different 
action than that taken heretofore. But the inhabitant will 
confirm this on his own narrow-minded, or as the popularizers of 
science would say "everyday," level. Consequently, it will be 
easy for a highly-educated Duma member to ignore such a 
confirmation and to insist on a continuation of the previous 
course of therapy. 
  Here's an old joke. The mother forgot to put sugar into the 
tea for her little son. The son is stirring the tea with his 
spoon with no result. "Mom, it's not sweet!" "Keep stirring, it 
will get sweet." 
  So, it looks like no matter how long you stir, things are 
not 
going to get sweet. The reasons for this are systemic; the 
inhabitant experiences them in his very bones. The problems, or 
at least one of the problems, that besiege the Russian economy 
are beginning to spin out of control. 
  Judging by everything, a new downturn mechanism in the 
economy is beginning to appear. Its essence is the transition to 
a classical depression within the regimen of compulsory 
automatic fluctuations. After all, simplistically defined, 
depressions are crises of overproduction with subsequent cuts in 
entrepreneurship, high unemployment and low prices. All of these 
features that are characteristic canonical forms of depression 
are beginning to reveal themselves here. 
  Overproduction is obvious. It is true that here, under 
conditions of an industrial downturn, overproduction is 
relative, but recently it has manifest itself quite 
authentically -- in the sales crisis that is growing more and 
more urgent (see the survey of wholesale prices in KOMMERSANT 
Number 8). Economic activities are also being curtailed. 
Moreover, this is proceeding now at an increasing pace -- 
whereas during the second 6 months of last year the number of 
lengthy stoppages of enterprises and production increased by an 
average of 7 percent per month, in February of this year the 
pace doubled. Finally, the slowing price dynamic is logically 
included in this somber picture. 
  Especially alarming is the development of two or more 
interrelated problems. For example, the downturn, the sales 
crisis, and unemployment. As soon as they reach a fully 
discernible stage, they will begin to urge each other forward 
unstoppably. (Let us recall that the pace of growth of 
unemployment during the last 4 months is higher by a factor of 2 
than in the course of the first 10 months of last year.) The 
"domino principle" will begin working with its full force -- the 
downturn gives rise to a further curtailment in production. Here 
a kind of technological multiplicator quite clearly takes hold. 
In turn, the growing technological gap reaches a critical level, 
and not just individual shops but entire enterprises cease 
production, and not temporarily, but permanently. From this come 
unpaid vacations and firings. Unemployment grows, demand falls. 
And so on and so forth, until -- until what? 
  At least until there is a change in priorities of government 
economic policy. It is understandable that such a change in and 
of itself is no guarantee of an immediate (or even a slow) turn 
for the better. However, without this kind of change it is 
impossible to speak of any improvement. The country has no money 
and stock issues are suppressed. By what miracle will demand be 
revived? How will the creation or maintenance of job slots be 
paid for? How will investment activity be revived when, after 
having reached a certain level, it is capable of attracting home 
the Russian capital that has migrated all over the planet? 
  Unfortunately, until recently the government has not sought 
answers to such obvious questions; moreover, it somehow seemed 
embarrassed to even ask them. It seems that now a very 
noteworthy moment has come in the economic history of our 
country. On the one hand, these questions are beginning to be 
asked, and on the other -- it is not too late to ask them. Such 
a miraculous coincidence will not last long - we must beware 
that such questions will quite soon become academic. 
<H5>  The Last Chance for the Prime Minister to Remain in the </H5>
Shade and the Last Chance for Zavlabs [Laboratory directors] to 
Come Into the Light 
  Let us look in greater detail at the political collisions 
that are being created by Shokhin's predictions. 
  For this we must go back in time and remember the last 
presidential message and the meetings of the presidium of the 
council of ministers and the expanded council of ministers held 
to deal with the budget and the directions of economic policy 
for 1994 in the light of the aforementioned message. 
  Let us recall that the president, recognizing the need to 
reform Russian reforms, on the one hand called upon the 
government to use all its power to fight inflation, and on the 
other hand, looked with understanding at the fact that 
enterprise directors (in last year's terms -- "red" or even 
"red-brown") impatiently expect government repayment of debts 
and support, even if it is selective and sometimes structural. 
The president also admitted that the new mass class of owners in 
Russia (thanks to vouchers) nevertheless needs social protection 
(and not at all from the work force). 
  In other words, the president gave the government the power 
to make decisions along a very broad spectrum of economic policy 
directions, as long as the decisions made sense. 
  But as we have already written before, the government did 
not 
use the chance to raise the banner of reform to a new height. 
This is not surprising; after all, the council of ministers used 
materials still prepared by the team of Fedorov-Gaydar and 
agreed upon amongst themselves. As a result, in his speech the 
prime minister had only to swear unity with the president and to 
lament the fact that the "zavlabs" were first to abandon ship. 
  Presenting his predictions to the prime minister, Aleksandr 
Shokhin (whether he wanted to or not) not only placed a 
complicated dilemma before himself and before Sergei Dubinin as 
to how to behave in the Duma, he also quite firmly and 
impartially pushed the prime minister towards making a national 
political decision. Now Mr. Chernomyrdin will have to decide 
whether Mr. Shokhin is interpreting the president's message 
correctly in proposing the variant of "stock issue investments 
in exchange for a slowing of the downturn." 
  Naturally, although the problems of industry are closer to 
the prime minister than the fate of the "zavlabs," and although 
Aleksandr Shokhin is evidently much more personable than Boris 
Fedorov, presenting the Duma with a budget based on Shokhin's 
predictions is equivalent for the prime minister to entering 
into open polemics with factions opposed to the government. 
There is a double risk in this. First of all, no one wants to 
get tangled up with the Duma. Secondly, the president has left 
himself the option to make clarifications at any moment about 
that which he had in mind in his message, and here Shokhin may 
not have guessed right. For example, Aleksandr Nikolayevich did 
not guess correctly which of the four living ex-presidents of 
the U. S., in the opinion of the Russian president, is insulting 
our great power to the largest degree with his behavior at the 
present time. 
  For Russian monetarists, for whom the last refuge is the 
state duma, Shokhin's prognosis is also the question of 
questions. Their game plan is evident. If Shokhin decides to 
reconfigure the budget, to "hammer it out" in the Duma to such 
an extent that the question of his removal is put on the agenda, 
then Chernomyrdin may become scared, and for the sake of making 
peace with the attacking side, may propose the post of economics 
minister to one of the monetarists. This is their last chance, 
for if Shokhin's attempt is not successful and his version of 
the 1994 budget is passed, the question of political 
rehabilitation of "zavlabs" will be delayed another year. Even 
then who knows how it will be decided, because the "zavlabs" 
evidently (at least a little, and only amongst themselves) 
cannot but have doubts that their reform was ideal. 
Consequently, a chance remains that if reform proceeds 
differently, reform successes might be somewhat greater than 
with their participation. 
  On the other hand, they are afraid of frightening Shokhin, 
and for this reason are not yet criticizing his prognosis, the 
essence of which is undoubtedly known to them. First of all, 
they have their own people in the economy and finance 
ministries, and, secondly, they know better than anyone else 
that the old prognosis does not coincide with the budget (after 
all, they created it themselves and made a comparison). 
  Evidently, this is why the press, which chronically supports 
Russian monetarists and any of their innovations, has only 
published articles directed at Aleksandr Shokhin personally. 
They say (with reference to the authority of Boris Fedorov) 
things such as that with the indecent reputation that the 
authors of articles have attributed to Aleksandr Shokhin he will 
have to work in the health ministry (as if it befits people with 
poor reputations to work there). Such articles naturally can 
greatly aid criticism of the economics ministry prognosis, 
setting even those deputies who understand very little about the 
budget against it. Truly, can a person be correct if newspapers 
write that today some journalists do not like his reputation? 
  In the light of the aforementioned, we see one powerful 
factor that may influence Chernomyrdin in making a fateful 
political decision. This is the reaction to the situation by 
Mishel Kamlessyu, director of the MVF [International Monetary 
Fund]. If, as a result of meetings with Chernomyrdin and 
Shokhin, he says something to the effect that the crash of the 
Russian economy must be stopped at any price, this means that we 
do not have to worry about our homegrown monetarists.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Malyshkov, vice mayor of the Moscow </F>
government, director of the Department of the Consumer Market 
and Consumer Services: "Stores Have Become Private"] 
  [Text] Privatization of commerce has opened the door for 
the development of market relations in the country. Government 
divestment should be seen as a process of transition to variety 
in forms of property, to new management forms and to 
entrepreneurship as a means of creating a dynamic economy by 
increasing the stimulus to work. 
  Why has commerce moved to the forefront of privatization, 
where it must be acted upon decisively? The reason is that no 
movement toward the market is possible until the system of 
bureaucratic distribution of the produced product is broken. For 
long years a great deal of concern was expressed about how to 
"correctly" distribute, whom to take away from, and whom to give 
to. This system of distributing everything is one of the 
supporting members of the command system and its supplementary 
underground economy. 
  Time has shown that government trade is basically unable to 
create a real stimulus for the producer, to enliven turnover 
between the city and the village or to stimulate goods 
procurement operations. The economy was built on laws of direct 
distribution, without effective reverse ties along all of the 
parameters of the national economy. However, product quality, 
abundance of goods, and conscientiousness in trade -- all of 
this cannot be subject to dictates but develops out of economic 
conditions. The consumer-purchaser has one eternal and 
inalienable right -- the right to make choices in the market, 
"voting" with his wallet. This is an important feature of an 
individual's political freedom. 
  At the same time, the distribution system turned out to be a 
very costly operation because of the need to support a huge 
apparatus for goods distribution at all levels and in all 
systems (in planning organs, in ministries, in soviets of all 
levels, and so forth). It would be appropriate to note that from 
the very beginning the distribution system was predisposed to 
abuses, speculation, and corruption. Speculation itself is the 
own child of the government monopoly in consumer goods 
production and trade. It is also exceptionally important that 
the market economy allows the country to become an integral part 
of the world economy and to make use of the advantages of such a 
division of labor. To do this we must have general business 
laws, the freedom to trade goods, a stable currency and, most 
importantly, a legally-based civil society. 
  Privatization of commerce, together with other measures, is 
being called upon to radically alter the situation -- to remove 
the administrative superstructure, to open the way to 
competition, and to eliminate ongoing shortages, which were 
artificially created even when they did not exist. The 
distribution system -- the government monopoly in production, 
distribution and trade, is to be replaced by a social-market 
mechanism and free trade capable of balancing supply and demand 
in the market. This is not a goal but a means. The social role 
of commerce is being strengthened. Protecting the interests of 
the buyer is a strategic path towards the development of trade. 
Trade is the branch in which we can expect the most rapid and 
radical changes in property relations and a high level of 
privatization. 
  In Moscow over 90 percent of stores, public nutrition 
enterprises and consumer service enterprises have been 
privatized. This is a large number, considerably more than in 
any other region in the country. The process of "small" 
privatization has become irreversible and evidently will be 
completed, for all practical purposes, in the near future. 
  As we know, Moscow took the initiative in privatizing 
enterprises in the service sphere from the very beginning, when 
a normative base did not yet exist. A considerable amount has 
been accomplished. Things are always difficult for the first to 
do something. Everyone criticizes Moscow-style "small" 
privatization for being carried out in haste, for the things 
that have not yet been done, and for the things that have 
already been completed. 
  Were mistakes made? Yes, they were, and some of them were 
extensive and basic. But not all the criticism that continues to 
this day is conclusive, well-grounded or convincing. Much of the 
criticism is slander and intrigue. People write and say things 
that assume that privatization has not yielded anything, that 
trade points are "growing fat," and that services to the 
population have deteriorated. 
  Everything becomes known by drawing comparisons. Let us 
recall the fall of 1991 -- the complete breakdown of the market, 
empty stores, demeaning lines, and a sense of helplessness. 
There were many predictions of hunger, cold, and revolts. These 
predictions did not materialize; the market is being 
reestablished. It is a truism that to properly understand what 
occurred and is occurring in trade, to make a well-grounded 
assessment of privatization, one should use as a basis the fact 
that the apple (trade) does not fall far from the tree 
(economy). Trade is a slice of the condition of society, its 
barometer. There is no reason to hope for a "good" barometer 
reading when the weather is miserable. In trade the diseases of 
the past and the mistakes of the present are manifest as nowhere 
else. 
  Today we can finally say that there is a light at the end of 
the tunnel. The main character in the market is His Highness 
Goods. The shortage of consumer goods was the "birthmark" of our 
entire history during the existence of the 
command-administrative system. As theoretical and practical 
weapons we had the dogma that consumer demand must gradually 
outstrip goods production and the supply of these goods to the 
population. In other words, under socialism demand could never 
be satisfied, and the tormenting word "deficit" was ours for 
eternity. 
  The concept of "real income" long ago became relative, 
because it is impossible to name a product group for which 
demand would be fully met. According to orienting figures, 
during successful 1970 (some sigh about it even now), 20 
percent, and in 1978 -- already 53 percent of growth in savings 
were the result of unsatisfied demand. 
  The pumping in of money unsupported by goods became a flood 
that drowned trade completely in subsequent years. The hope that 
a consumer could purchase inexpensive goods, even if he had to 
wait in line, was less and less justified. Not everything could 
be bought by far, but the population was wittingly issued 
depreciated money. 
  The monetary income of citizens systematically outstripped 
increases in the total volume of commodity turnover and paid 
services. At the same time there was a concealed growth in 
government retail prices, and the quality of goods decreased 
while prices remained the same. This entire shortage of goods 
was not due to the country's poverty; after all, it was inferior 
to none in military strength. It was the fruit of certain 
choices and ideologies, i.e., the realization of the postulate 
that in contrast to capitalism, our demand must outstrip the 
production of goods and push it forward, and this, they said, 
was the advantage of our state. The crisis within the system led 
right to the collapse of production, and the shortage became 
most urgent. 
  A year or two ago the shelves of many stores were totally 
empty. Today, although not everywhere, most shelves are filled 
with goods of the kind the consumer hardly ever saw on the open 
market even during the best of times. Enterprises have appeared 
that are not inferior to the best contemporary models in terms 
of both quantity of products as well as of commercial technology 
and organization and services to the consumer. The most 
characteristic features include complete economic independence 
of enterprises, their direct ties with suppliers, rejection of 
the practice of state funding with its accompanying trail of 
paperwork and misappropriation of assets and time from a large 
number of workers, and finally, the appearance of new stores on 
the level of world standards. 
  Take GUM [Government department store], for example, which 
recently celebrated its centennial. Its collective is pursuing 
the goal of creating a world-class store. No, this is not at all 
an attempt to "sell GUM to foreigners lock, stock and barrel," 
as some "specialists" claim. The goal is a different one: 
stockholders are looking for and finding partners who are 
multiplying their efforts to organize the most modern trade 
enterprise. Large wholesale trading associations such as 
Master-Lider, Olbi, Roditi, Ofis-Klub and many others are making 
themselves known. The trade enterprises of many countries, 
including Moskva-Makdonalds, Moskovskaya Pishcha, the Russian 
French MOS-Danon SP [Specialized enterprise], the Russian-German 
Taki-Moskva SP, and others, are operating successfully in the 
capital. The old MacDonald's restaurant and its two younger 
brothers are especially popular. The interest in expanding joint 
commercial operations is evident not only in the capital, but in 
other countries as well. The fruits of cooperation include 
better quality services and the introduction of new technologies 
that are naturally based on mutual interests and advantages. 
  Would you like to see with your own eyes stores in the 
capital that are commercial jewels in the fullest sense of the 
word? Then visit the Novoarbat or the Tverskoy food stores. They 
have a wide variety of fresh products. The stores belong to 
stockholders and do without middlemen. For this reason, the 
proportion of trading costs in the price of the product at the 
Tverskoy store, for example, is a little over 11 percent, which 
is considerably lower than in any other. Having begun 4 years 
ago with a lease, the enterprise is increasing turnover, having 
now reached the billion-ruble-per-month mark. The bank joined 
the food store as co-owner. And another feature: Suppliers from 
near and faraway places abroad trust their goods to the store. 
About 30 percent of goods turnover involves products that are 
sold on consignment, i.e., with payment going to the supplier 
after the goods are sold to the population. 
  There is a considerable number of such stores. 
Unfortunately, 
however, there are many more that one is grieved to look at, 
where the operating principle is "I do whatever I want" and 
where trade rules are flouted. Intoxicated by the newly-received 
freedom and by the opportunity to make quick and large profits, 
such trade "points" are moving towards abuse without concern for 
their own development. Every second buyer in such enterprises is 
cheated in the weighing of the product or during the payment 
transaction. Often the items for sale are of poor quality, and 
sometimes they are downright dangerous to one's health. These, 
however, are remnants, and we will bring order here. 
  However, let us return to privatization. If Moscow were not 
in a hurry to complete this work, and had it continued to 
receive goods according to "plan," and allocated from "funds," 
the picture today would be lamentable. Government deliveries 
planned last year and at the beginning of this year, have fallen 
through completely. The capital has received and today is 
receiving fewer than half of the promised deliveries. About 55 
percent of the food products consumed by Muscovites were 
procured and delivered by new entrepreneurial structures. For 
some industrial goods almost 100 percent of goods are supplied 
in this manner. These are the first fruits of rejuvenated 
trading and its contribution to supplying a city of many 
millions of people. 
  Let us explore another aspect of the question -- the social 
structure of goods turnover. In terms of forms of property this 
structure is changing rapidly and quite considerably. For the 
first time, Russian consumers put less money into state trade 
than into non-government trade. Today the share of the former 
already comprises only 46 percent. The proportion of private 
trading is 40 percent and of consumer cooperatives -- about 14 
percent. 
  In terms of privatization pace, retail trade is the leader 
within the domestic economy - 40,000 stores, halls, cafeterias 
and cafes are in private hands today. This is only 8 percent, 
which does not seem to be a large number. Nevertheless, this 
small proportion of privatized enterprises sells as much as the 
entire state trade, and if we also consider turnover in consumer 
cooperatives this figure is even greater. 
  The state store is inferior not only in goods turnover but 
in 
profitability as well -- in private "points" it is higher by a 
factor of 1.5, and in terms of effectiveness of expenditures 
(the relationship of profits to circulation expenses) -- by a 
factor of 2. 
  Of course, retail prices are higher by a factor of 1.5 in 
private shops than in state stores. However, an enormous 
distribution apparatus associated with the practice of funding, 
the writing of orders to receive goods, and so forth, has been 
liquidated. As a result, total volume of goods turnover in 1993 
exceeded the preceding year by 4 percent. Note that there was an 
increase and not a decrease. The natural use of basic foodstuffs 
-- meat and meat products, eggs, potatoes, vegetables, sugar and 
confectionery items -- also increased. 
  But let us be fair. Some problems are solved, others remain 
and new ones are developing. Former state and municipal 
enterprises were usually privatized in the capital in the form 
of property of labor collectives. Today only 30 percent of them 
have purchase-sales contracts and attestations of the right to 
ownership. This means that almost two-thirds of privatized 
enterprises have "become stuck" between earth and sky -- between 
private and state. Practically not a single one of them has, as 
of yet, a legally formulated document related to the right to 
land use (place where the trade object is located). 
  Thus, on the one hand, most stores are considered owners; on 
the other hand, strictly speaking their collectives occupy the 
role of hired labor. Such "owners" naturally do not take the 
risk of investing assets to expand goods turnover and to develop 
their material base. They are interested in transforming profits 
into their own personal wages as quickly as possible. 
  Normative documents allow for only two forms of selling -- 
at 
auction or according to "strict" competition in the form of 
closed bidding. But world practice includes other, more 
effective methods. For example, there is special-purpose selling 
not to the one who pays the most but to the one who proposes the 
best conditions for utilizing the trade object. In our opinion, 
a new concept should be included in the government privatization 
program -- open trading with set conditions. This will become a 
serious hindrance to those who love behind-the-scenes deals. It 
can be said that the most effective forms of selling still fall 
outside the sphere of our activities. 
  Incidentally, we should remember that in the relatively 
successful East Germany plants often were sold at the standard 
price of 1 mark, with the obligation that investments be made. 
The federal government spent tens of billions of marks to 
improve enterprises that were being sold instead of submitting 
to enticing dreams about some sort of fantastic income from the 
sale of their own losses. 
  An analysis of data on the course of commercial 
privatization 
convincingly shows that enterprises of the former state trade 
are making the transition more and more to collective-share 
ownership by labor collectives. This includes the largest 
department stores, restaurants, trade centers, and wholesale 
bases. Many of them, despite the short period of work following 
privatization, have proven that they have managed successfully 
as owners and are able to compete with private owners and 
commercial structures, maintain specialization of enterprises, 
increase sales volume and raise the level of social guarantees 
for workers. 
  We should also stop to consider the figures that reflect the 
selection of a particular method of privatization. Auctions, 
despite their support by an unceasing propaganda campaign, have 
not become significantly widespread. Even today, preference is 
given to the practice of buying out leased property, especially 
within the sphere of retail trade. On the one hand, this is a 
concession to the interest of labor collectives. On the other 
hand, it is a verification of fact -- there is an absence of 
real competition in the commercial property market. It turns out 
that it is not easy to find other owners willing to invest their 
money in primitive counters, tumbledown structures, and 
equipment that became obsolete long ago. We cannot but 
acknowledge the sad fact that there has been a sharp downturn in 
the development of the branch's material-technical base. 
  The auction is the most widespread, but not the only, form 
of 
selling. We foresee the possibility of carrying out contest 
sales. The advantages of holding a contest are apparent. We are 
referring to the interests of the population first and foremost. 
One owner will replace the bakery with a disco-bar; another will 
open a bakery within a "Khleb" [bread] store. Moreover, a 
mandatory condition in a contest is the preservation of 
specialization (commercial profile, sales level, services) for a 
period of 3 years. These stipulations must be included in 
contracts during the subsequent changing of hands of the object, 
if this occurs before the completion of the 3-year period. 
  Unfortunately, there are problems even with "small" 
privatization. The profits achieved by commercial enterprises do 
not assure their financial security. According to various 
calculations, deductions decrease possible profits by half, and 
subsequent payments into the budget, the payment of numerous 
taxes and dues curtail the remaining half by this same amount. 
The remainder, which as we know, is not always "sweet," is very 
small; it is even insufficient to purchase goods. The federal 
budget does not earmark assets to maintain commercial 
enterprises. All hope lies in local organs of authority. The 
need for commercial investment is enormous. After all, a 
calamitous reduction in its material-technical base is 
occurring. In 1992, for example, the number of stores decreased 
by almost one-fourth. 
  During the period of transition to market relations it is 
vitally important to have government support, especially 
initially. In Poland, for example, beginning commercial traders 
do not pay a turnover or income tax for 2 years and 1 year 
respectively if they are selling industrial goods. 
  Let us summarize what has been said. Commercial 
privatization 
in Russia, including Moscow, is unprecedented in scale and 
cannot be compared to the experience of any other country in the 
world, even if we take into account the great technical 
difficulties involving its form, the voucher system and the 
valuation of objects being privatized and their property. The 
privatization program passed by the Russian Supreme Soviet 
provides unjustifiably large incentives to labor collectives. 
Evidently, it is hardly reasonable to change privatization rules 
while privatization is in progress, and to thus risk provoking 
large social conflicts. Evidently, the current stage of 
privatization must be completed and rules must be changed 
gradually. This must be done according to mutual agreements and 
not according to the dictates of a particular side. 
  The main difficulty is that property has already been 
divided 
up, and active control over it on the part of the new owners is 
absent. Here the administration as well as the labor collective 
must play an increased role. This is why it is our task to 
develop effective owners, to formulate rules and procedures for 
redistributing property, and to create a system that will 
withstand any attempts to squander it. It is important to move 
from a system of almost free distribution of property to one in 
which property is sold, from unconditional privatization to 
privatization based on supplementary investment, and to 
conditions that protect the interests and rights of consumers. 
  No less important today is the need to strengthen the 
responsibility of those who buy privatized enterprises. Here we 
must adhere strictly to purchase-sale conditions. With this 
goal, contracts must foresee all of the essential conditions for 
providing model services to the population. For our part, we 
must foresee effective forms of control over adherence to such 
conditions and severe sanctions for violations of these 
conditions. 
  The role of commerce is not limited to the sale of goods. A 
no less important task is to provide exemplary services to the 
consumer. The higher calling of commerce is to serve man, and 
that is the whole point of commercial privatization.

  [Abstract] Growing interest in zinc sulfide as a material 
for use in optical-electrical devices precipitated the problem 
of preparing this substance having the required properties of 
microcrystallinity, departure from stoichiometry, content of 
basic substances, etc. In the present work a study was made of 
the effects of some technological factors on the properties of 
zinc sulfide films and the possibility of regulating their 
physical chemical properties during the growth process. Thus the 
rate of zinc sulfide formation at constant magnetic field 
stress, was found to be significantly affected by the presence 
of iron impurities in the solution. Also, the strength of the 
magnetic field affects the structure of the water and the zinc 
salt complex becomes a factor. As the field strength increases, 
old structures break down and new ones are formed. Increasing 
the concentration of iron ions in the solution only increases 
the overall rate of the reaction. Particle size data on zinc 
sulfide powders shows that raising the pH from 11.40 to 11.44 
results in a marked improvement in structure and mirror finish 
of the film. Figures 2; references 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Luminescent lithium (deuterium) hydride could 
possibly be used as a neutron scintillation detector, since it 
is assumed to be highly efficient in detecting neuron 
scintillation and in being highly sensitive to _g_-radiation. 
Also, the simplicity of the lithium hydride structure 
facilitates its fundamental study. LiH luminescence was first 
detected in samples activated with magnesium. Later, studies 
were made with lithium hydride activated with mercury-like ions, 
although the nature of the mercury-like coloration sites in 
LiH(LiD) has not yet been established. Luminescence of 
palladium-group ions in lithium (deuterium) hydride has not yet 
been observed. In the present work single crystals of LiH(D):Ru 
were grown and their luminescence spectra studied for the first 
time. The spectra displayed features related to the structure 
(progression along a valent local fluctuation of hydride ions in 
the doped center) and fluctuations of the base lattice. A 
qualitative simulation of the luminescence site is presented.

  [Abstract] The development of hybrid-cascade solid state 
visualizers for near infra-red radiation (0.8-13 mkm) using 
antistokes luminophores (ASL) provided a new impulse to the 
research and development of these materials. The mechanism for 
accumulating and transmitting energy by rare earth metal ions 
and the fundamental properties of known ASL matrices activated 
with rare earth metal ions determine the lower density limit of 
power P[.sub]min[/] and its associated upper wavelength limit 
_l_[.sub]max[/] of transformed infra-red radiation. 
Visualizers and the luminophores used in them may be divided 
into three groups, depending on intended use and design. The 
simplest visualizer is intended for observations made with the 
naked eye of relatively weak infra-red sources (light emitting 
diodes, lasers), and it consists of an ordinary screen covered 
with a layer of ASL within which the entire infra-red 
transformation process takes place. Visualizers for ``weak'' 
fields (10[.sup]- 2[/] watt per cm[.sup]2[/]) are 
capable of transforming IR-radiation of 1.1 mkm or greater into 
visual, such as objects viewed in a dark moon-less night. The 
spectral make up of this type of illumination is determined by 
the transmission lines of water vapor, one of which takes place 
in the 1.4-1.6 mkm range. These visualizers embody a 
hybrid-cascade layout which includes a screen having an ASL and 
a phototransformer. Here, the luminescent screen transforms the 
1.4-1.6 lines into the shorter IR region of 0.8-1.1 mkm with the 
phototransformer performing the dual functions of intensifying 
and transforming the glow from the luminophore into illumination 
on the exit screen. The most promising trend in the development 
of antistokes infra-red visualizers with P[.sub]min[/] &lt; 
10[.sup]-2[/] watt per cm[.sup]2[/] and _l_[.sub]max[/] 
&gt;  1.1 mkm may be realized under the conditions of a quantum 
counter in a parametric converter of the ``heterodyne'' type. 
Its operation is based on the properties of several ASL to 
increase the intensity of a spectral line in the presence of two 
other radiations, one of which has a long wavelength and serves 
as excitation source, while the other of another wavelength 
serves as a signal. Results obtained provide a basis for 
considering the second and third trends as the most promising 
for visualizers of weak and ultra-weak infra-red radiation in 
the 1-13 mkm range. Their realization requires the development 
of new, non-traditional methods and devices for parametric 
excitation, as well as the development of new classes of 
antistokes luminophores. Figures 2; references 17: 16 Russian, 1 
Western.

  [Abstract] Ultradisperse diamonds were obtained from 
trinitrotoluene by shock-compression synthesis. They were 
separated from the residual solid products by treating the 
latter first with an organic solvent (saturated or aromatic 
hydrocarbon) at a temperature of 400 and pressure of 250 
atm and then with a mixture of concentrated 
H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] and HNO[.sub]3[/]. In aqueous 
solutions, the ultradisperse diamonds (3 to 8 x 10[.sup]-3[/] 
m in diameter) thus separated formed aggregates up to 200 
m in size. Externally, the ultradisperse diamonds were a 
dense dark gray powder. Elemental analysis established that they 
consisted of the following (percent): C, 78.6-78.8; H, 
0.65-0.70; O, 16.5-17.0; N, 1.78-2.16; and ash residue, 
2.47-1.34. The large amounts of oxygen found in the functional 
groups on the surface of the ultradisperse diamonds were 
attributed to the oxidation treatment, as well as to the 
presence of oxygen (and nitrogen) in the diamonds' defect 
lattices in the form of various impurity centers during the 
shock-compression synthesis process. A comparison of the 
infrared spectra of the ultradisperse diamonds before and after 
modification confirmed the stability of the diamonds' different 
functional groups and the change in the chemical state of their 
surfaces. The presence of different types of nitrogen impurity 
centers in the ultradisperse diamonds was also confirmed by 
infrared spectroscopy. Figures 2, table 1; references 9: 7

  [Abstract] TiO[.sub]2[/] films were produced on a 
metallic titanium surface by hydrolysis of a solution of 
polybutyltitanate in air. The resultant amorphous films were 
heated at a temperature of 450 to 500C for 1 hour. This 
resulted in the formation of an anatase modification of a 
polycrystalline TiO[.sub]2[/] film (i.e., 
Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/]). Next the electrochemical deposition of Cu, 
Pd, and Ag onto the surface of Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes 
was studied. The deposition was performed from a solution 
containing nitrates of the respective metals with a 
concentration of 10[.sup]-5[/] to 10[.sup]-3[/] M. In some 
of the experiments, the deposition was conducted under 
continuous ultraviolet irradiation in an electrochemical cell. 
Preliminary electrochemical deposition of the metal particles 
onto the surface of the Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes was 
accomplished by cathode deposition of a calculated amount of 
metal in a galvanostatic mode. Some of the electrodes were 
modified by adsorption of Pd[.sup]2+[/] ions from a 0.005 M 
PdCl[.sub]2[/] solution for 10 to 1,000 seconds under 
closed-circuit conditions. The electrochemical experiment was 
conducted in a conventional electrochemical cell with a P-5827M 
potentiostat. Saturated Ag chloride served as the normal 
electrode, and a platinum electrode served as the auxiliary 
electrode. The experiments established that the deposition of 
each of the aforementioned metals on TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes 
occurred with a higher cathode overvoltage than on metallic 
electrodes in the respective solutions. Preliminary 
electrochemical deposition of Ag particles onto the electrodes 
at a surface concentration of 10[.sup]14[/] 
atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] or less resulted in a decrease in the Ag 
deposition overvoltage by more than 0.1 V. Modification of the 
electrode surface by Cu particles in amounts up to 
10[.sup]15[/] to 10[.sup]16[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] 
resulted in only a slight shift of the cathode arm of the 
potentiodynamic curve to the negative side. Nor did preliminary 
electrochemical modification by Pd particles with a 
concentration of 10[.sup]15[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] have any 
significant effect on the position of the cathode arm when it 
was Pd that was being electrochemically deposited. Only when the 
amount of Pd deposited in advance was increased to 
10[.sup]16[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] did the deposition 
potential shift by 0.05-0.1 V. Preliminary modification of the 
electrode surface by Ag in the amount of 10[.sup]16[/] 
atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] resulted in a shift in the cathode arm of 
the potentiodynamic curve to the positive side, i.e., it 
resulted in a decrease in the cathode overvoltage of the metal's 
deposition as compared with that in the case of an unmodified 
electrode. Irradiation of the TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes with 
ultraviolet radiation during the electrochemical process did 
alter the potential of the deposition of Cu or Pd. In the case 
of Ag, however, irradiation caused an decrease in the 
overvoltage of the metal's deposition by more than 0.1 V and a 
significant increase in process rate. When Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] 
electrodes in contact with a 0.005 M AgNO[.sub]3[/] solution 
were subjected to ultraviolet irradiation (H = 0.1 
J/cm[.sup]2[/]), photolytic silver particles ranging in size 
from 5 to 50 nm formed in a concentration of 10[.sup]8[/] to 
10[.sup]9[/] cm[.sup]-2[/] (with a predominance of 
particles measuring 5-10 nm in size). As the electrodes' 
exposure increased (H = 1 J/cm[.sup]2[/]), the concentration 
increased (to 10[.sup]10[/] cm[.sup]-2[/]) with virtually 
no change in the particles' size distribution. Only at much 
higher exposures (to 10 J/cm[.sup]2[/]) did larger particles 
(50-100 nm) appear and smaller particles (5-10 nm) disappear. 
Cathode polarization of the Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrode 
coupled with simultaneous ultraviolet irradiation resulted in 
particles that were an order of magnitude larger than those 
formed when the deposition process was conducted with no 
irradiation. The significant differences observed for the 
selectivity of the deposition of Cu, Ag, and Pd was attributed 
to the fact that the energy levels of the metal particles 
created did not in all cases correspond with the position of the 
Fermi level of TiO[.sub]2[/]. Kinetic factors involved in the 
growth of the particles of the metal phase were also implicated.

  [Abstract] Complexes of copper (II) chloride with 
3,3-dimethyl-1-(4',4'-dimethylcyclohexa-2',6'-dione-1'-yl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline 

were synthesized. An equimolar quantity of 
CuCl[.sub]2[/][.sup].[/]2H[.sub]2[/]O solid crystal 
hydrate was added to a solution of 0.3 mmol of ligand in 5 ml 
CH[.sub]3[/]CN at room temperature. The mixture was stirred 
intensively until the salt dissolved and then held for 2 days. 
The resultant light green crystals were filtered off, rinsed 
with hexane, and dried over CaCl[.sub]2[/]. When chemically 
pure acetone was used as the solvent, small acicular yellow 
crystals were formed. The CuCl[.sub]2[/]L complexes were 
subjected to x-ray crystallographic analysis on a CAD-4 
diffractometer, infrared spectroscopy on a Specord 751R, and EPR 
studies on an SE/X-2544 EPR spectrometer (Radiopan). The 
crystals of the compounds formed were classified as triclinic 
with lattice parameters as follows: a = 8.391(1), b = 10.486(2), 
and c = 6.42(7) angstroms; _a_ = 81.07(3), _b_ = 87.27(3), 
and 
_g_ = 72.04(1); V = 962.5(6) A[.sup]3[/]; Z = 2; and 
limiting boundary = P1. The x-ray crystallographic analysis 
established that in the complex, the 
cyclohexanedioneisoquinoline functions as a bridge ligand that 
is coordinated to its two neighboring copper atoms through the 
oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups of the cyclohexanedione 
fragment of the molecule. The studies further established that 
the ligand in the complex has the very same tautomeric form as 
in a uncoordinated state. The spectrochemical characteristics of 
the tautomeric form and the method of coordination of 
dihydroisoquinolinecyclohexanedione were determined. The EPR 
spectroscopy studies confirmed Cu-Cu magnetic interaction in 
polycrystalline samples of the complexes. The degree of 
polymerism of the polycrystalline specimens studied was found to 
depend on the quantity of crystallization water present in them.

  [Abstract] An optimum process flow for refining petroleum 
benzin that makes it possible to obtain both benzene and AI-93 
high-quality unleaded gasoline was developed on the basis of a 
process that was previously developed at the Institute of 
Petrochemical Processes of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences. 
Three versions of the petroleum benzin-refining process were 
studied: 1) catalytic enrichment; 2) removal of the 
70C-90C benzene fraction from the petroleum benzin for 
subsequent enrichment; and 3) removal of the benzene fraction 
for petrochemical purposes, removal of the low-boiling through 
70C (l.b.-70C) fraction for subsequent etherification 
by C[.sub]1[/]-C[.sub]3[/] monohydric alcohols, and 
removal of the 70C through catalytic cracking 
(70C-c.c.) fraction for catalytic enrichment and subsequent 
mixing with the l.b.-70C fraction after etherification. The 
catalytic enrichment was conducted on a consolidated laboratory 
unit with a fluidized bed of zeolite-containing catalyst such as 
Tseokar-2 at a temperature of 100-120C and pressure of 
2.5-3 MPa. When petroleum benzin was subjected to catalytic 
enrichment under stringent conditions (i.e., at 520C), a 
yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85 according to the 
motor method (98 according to the research method) of 82.9 
percent was achieved; however, the said gasoline had a high 
aromatic hydrocarbon content (49.2 percent). Under less 
stringent conditions (i.e., at 480C), the gasoline yield 
increased to 87.2 percent and the content of aromatic 
hydrocarbons dropped to 37.2 percent (the said gasoline had an 
octane number of up to 83.5 according to the motor method and 
94.5 according to the research method). Catalytic enrichment of 
petroleum benzin without the 70-90C fraction resulted in an 
84.8 percent yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85 
(motor method) and with an aromatic hydrocarbon content of 39 
percent. The third version of the process resulted in a 5 
percent increase in gasoline yield. The said gasoline had a 
reduced aromatic hydrocarbon content and an oxygen-containing 
compound content of 2.5-2.6 percent. In addition to boosting 
aromatic hydrocarbon production efficiency, the new process flow 
also eliminates a number of the problems involved in producing 
high-octane fuels. Tables 2; references 2 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Zeolites with a pentacyl structure, such as 
TsVK, TsVM, TsVM, and ultrasil, are the main catalysts used in 
hydrodeparaffinization or selective hydrocracking of n-paraffin 
hydrocarbons. To produce high-quality transformer oils from 
paraffin raw materials, these catalysts must possess not only a 
high splitting activity but also a sufficient hydrogenating 
activity. Most hydrogenating heterogeneous catalysts contain 
either noble or rare earth metals or else group VI metals. 
Catalysts containing a nickel-molybdenum complex have a higher 
hydrogenating activity than do catalysts into which metals have 
been added by coextrusion or impregnation. Deposition of a 
nickel-molybdenum complex on solid carriers (aluminosilicates or 
zeolites) helps increase their hydrogenating activity and thus 
helps decrease the content of hydrogenating metals in the 
catalyst. A catalyst's isomerizing activity and its ability to 
redistribute hydrogen (thereby reducing the yield of unsaturated 
compounds) increases in the presence of small quantities of 
wide-pore zeolites (mordenite or ultrastable Y). Tungsten helps 
increase a catalyst's hydrogenating activity in relation to 
polycyclic aromatic compounds, and zinc and chromium reduce 
metals' migration and thereby increase their dispersion and the 
stability of a catalyst's operation. Zinc facilitates 
aromatization of paraffins, and chromium compounds possess an 
independent hydrogenating activity. These and other laws were 
used to develop a new catalyst, SGK-5, which is designed to 
replace the combination SGK-1 plus type AKM hydrogenating 
catalyst. SGK-5 contains nickel and molybdenum as its 
hydrogenating components. SGK-5 is simpler to use than the SGK-1 
+ AKM combination; however, it has not been possible to fully 
hydrogenate unsaturated compounds in the presence of SGK-5 
(despite the fact that it has a higher hydrogenating activity 
than the SGK-1 + AKM combination). For this reason, studies were 
undertaken to increase the hydrogenating activity of SGK-5. 
Eight different versions of SGK-5 were produced and compared. 
The comparative tests established that catalysts containing 16 
to 20 percent (wt) nickel-molybdenum complex have a high 
hydrogenating activity coupled with a high yield of target 
fraction. When the nickel-molybdenum complex exceeds 20 percent, 
the zeolite content decreases, which has an unfavorable effect 
on the product pour point. Catalysts based on type TsVN zeolite 
were found to result in a target fraction with a low pour point. 
Type TsVM-III zeolite and wide-pore zeolites resulted in 
somewhat of an elevation of the product pour point; however, the 
addition of dealuminized mordenite had a favorable effect on 
yield of the target fraction. Roasting just at 340C did not 
result in adequate activation of the zeolite component of the 
catalyst or (consequently) the necessary product pour point. 
Staged roasting at 340 and 500C proved optimum. Tables 2;

  [Abstract] Development of a new generation of apochromatic 
objective lenses requires optical materials having special 
properties. Optical glasses having a large variety of optical 
constants and other parameters which make it possible to develop 
optically perfect systems, play a leading role among such 
materials. A pressing problem is the development of glasses 
having both a special course of dispersion and low 
thermo-optical constant (TOP). These are called adiathermal 
glasses. The joining of special course of dispersion with low 
TOP makes it possible to develop systems which are 
non-misaligning under apochromatic-anastigmatic temperature 
gradient conditions with corrected secondary spectrum. With such 
systems the number of lenses in complex objective lens systems 
is determined by the special properties of the glasses and may 
be minimized. The majority of industrial glasses produced here 
and abroad do not simultaneously have adiathermal properties and 
special courses of dispersion. In the present work a series of 
adiathermal optical glasses with special courses of dispersion 
were developed. Data was also obtained which may be used in the 
synthesis of special purpose adiathermal glasses. Adiathermal 
phosphate glasses with special course of dispersion and fitting 
in various areas of the Abbe diagram were developed which have a 
number of advantages over similar industrial glasses. 
Calculations show that objective lenses consisting of the newly 
developed glasses are not inferior to industrial glasses in 
longitudinal chromatic aberration (secondary spectrum) and have 
less thermo-optical and thermo-wave aberration. Figures 3;

  [Abstract] The effects of various additives on the 
sintering and structure of magnesium oxide has been studied in 
the course of the development of periclase (magnesia) ceramics 
technology. Substances capable of forming solid solutions with 
periclase, which have lattice defects and thereby accelerate 
diffusion processes, significantly affect solid phase sintering. 
Effective activity has been observed in oxides having greater 
valency than magnesium. There appears to be contradictory 
evidence in the case of interaction of magnesium oxide with 
CeO[.sub]2[/] and Nd[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. In the 
present work with these oxides, phase composition of calcined 
samples was controlled with a special device and lattice 
parameters were deduced from profile lines obtained by scanning 
diffractometry. Microstructure was studied with both reflected 
and transmitted light. The results of the investigation led to 
the development of a technology for the preparation of a 
vacuum-tight structured periclase ceramic which functions 
successfully while in contact with melts and vapors of 
high-melting alkali metals and carbons. Stable metal-ceramic 
structural materials of the ceramic-alloyed steel-ceramic type, 
capable of being used in electronics and magnetohydrodynamics, 
were prepared by thermal-compression welding under vacuum.

  [Abstract] Large-scale use of electric heating films 
capable of providing surface heat emission at low 
heater-to-object temperature gradients, makes it is necessary to 
develop low-cost metal-ceramic and ceramic resistor coatings on 
ceramics and to study the effects of some technological factors 
on their properties. The use of any particular ceramic as an 
electric heater coating is hindered by the mutual diffusion 
between both the components of the film and its substrate which 
leads to chemical reactions in the interfacial zones resulting 
in a rise in the resistance of the coating to cause mechanical 
stresses which inhibit conducting processes. In this respect, 
the highly clayey ceramic (22KhS) is of considerable interest 
since it is chemically inert and does not react with the coating 
material. The problem of making low cost film heaters may be 
resolved through study of metal-ceramic (Me-clay-glass) and 
ceramic (transition metal oxide-glass former) systems. Selection 
of the proper material used in a system depends on the following 
considerations. In the first system the metal is used as a base 
for an electrically conducting component; the clay is needed to 
support the slip in a suspended state. Also, after losing its 
water of hydration, clay becomes more chemically active and 
reacts with metals to form the conducting phase, while glass 
serves to bind the metal particles to the ceramic base. In the 
second system, during the calcining process, the transition 
metal oxides form cations of varying valencies of the same 
element to provide the needed conditions for electrical 
conductivity. The oxide-glass former plays the same role as 
glass does in the first system. Slips, prepared using 
3d-elements (nickel, titanium, iron, copper, and chromium) and 
alloys of these elements with aluminum, boron, phosphorus, and 
silicon, were applied to ceramic objects by dipping or coating 
and tested for resistance to heat, cold temperatures, and 
moisture. Films containing Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Mo, V, La, and Nb 
oxides had the best electrical conductivities, and negative 
temperature coefficients of resistance. On heating, resistance 
drops rapidly and the objects become overheated and burn out 
unless a thermo-regulator is used. The coatings are resistant to 
vibration, cold, and moisture. References 2 (Russian).

  [Abstract] N-(trihalogermylmethyl)-substituted amides, 
lactams, and imides are pentacoordinated germanium derivatives 
that manifest antineoplastic and immunomodulating neurotropic 
properties. A series of experiments were conducted to find 
simple methods of synthesizing trichlorogermyl-substituted 
amides, lactams, and imides. The experiments confirmed that it 
is just as easy to form trichlorogermyl-substituted amides, 
lactams, and imides by condensing HGeCl[.sub]3[/] with 
compounds containing the fragment NCH[.sub]2[/]Cl as it is to 
form the said compounds by reacting HGeCl[.sub]3[/] with 
compounds containing the groupings NCH[.sub]2[/]OH and 
NCH[.sub]2[/]OH. The yields of the products 
RCH[.sub]2[/]GeCl[.sub]3[/] produced during the 
experiments reached 70-83 percent, which is 10-25 percent higher 
than when the respective N-methylolamide or N-methylolimide is 
used. Further studies of the chemical properties of amides, 
lactams, and imides with a 
Cl[.sub]3[/]GeCH[.sub]2[/]NC(O)-group established that the 
phthalamide derivative, unlike previously studied amide and 
lactam derivatives, splits upon boiling in concentrated 
hydrochloric acid. Next, several never-before-synthesized 
tribromo- and triiodogermyl derivatives were produced. In those 
cases where the intermediately formed sesquioxanes were water 
soluble and difficult to isolate, a new technique was used to 
obtain triiodogermyl derivatives, i.e., the effect of 
concentrated hydriodic acid directly on the respective 
trialkolxygermane. The new compounds were subjected by x-ray 
crystallographic and elemental analysis. The newly synthesized 
compounds were confirmed to contain a pentacoordinated germanium 
atom. Tables 3; references 17: 13 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Abstract] Spin-labeled crown ethers containing a spin 
label both in and not in direct proximity to the coordination 
sphere have been produced previously. In both cases, 
coordination of the nitroxyl group with the metal ion in the 
complex was not observed. For this reason, new ways of 
introducing a spin label at the amino group of easily accessible 
amino derivatives of crown ethers were proposed. Diazonium salts 
prepared from aminophenyl-substituted crown ethers were reacted 
with a paramagnetic imidazolinium salt to form spin-labeled 
crown ethers containing an arylazoenamine group as a component 
of the molecule. A second approach to synthesizing spin-labeled 
crown ethers was also proposed. It entailed reacting amino 
derivatives with paramagnetic isocyanate, which reacts with 
amines to form paramagnetic ureas. Equimolar quantities of 
isocyanate and amine were mixed to produce spin-labeled crown 
ethers that, together with an NaOH water-alcohol solution, form 
paramagnetic amidines. The latter approach makes it possible to 
synthesize spin-labeled crown ethers that contain an amidine 
grouping as a component of the molecule. This in turn makes it 
possible to control pH in a study micro-object by means of 
electron paramagnetic resonance. Table 1; references 9: 3

  [Abstract] An experimental study of maraging alloy steels 
was made concerning their fatigue strength and the mechanism of 
crack propagation in them under cyclic loads. The 
industrial-grade EP 678 steel (0.022% C, 10 9.30% 
Ni, 1.95% 
Mo, 0.84% Ti, 0.09% Cu, 0.088% Al, 
0.06% Zn, 0.02% Mn, 
0.01% Nb, 0.14% Si, 0.008% P, 0.007% 
S, 0.002 B) had been 
selected as a representative of this group. Ingots of this steel 
were heat treated as follows: quenching from 950-970C in 
water for 30 min + aging at 520+/-10C for 3 h. For fatigue 
tests and for microstructural examination they were cold-rolled 
into 3 mm thick strips after quenching and into 2 mm thick 
strips after aging. Some of the steel was quenched from 
980C and then cold-rolled into rods 50 mm in diameter for 
extra test. For determination of its standard mechanical 
properties, some of the steel was cold-rolled into rods 5 mm in 
diameter and specimens were cut out of them with the axis 
oriented in the direction of rolling. Cracking resistance under 
static loads was determined on 15 mm thick prismatic specimens 
under eccentric tension. For a determination of cracking 
resistance under impact loads acting perpendicularly to the 
direction of rolling, 10 mm square and 55 mm long bar specimens 
with a 1 mm deep notch were tested in a Charpy machine. Cyclic 
testing at a 50 Hz frequency was done: 1) in an Instron-1603 
machine on rods 50 mm in diameter under pure flexure, for 
determination of the endurance limit;2) in an Instron-1253 
machine on 2 mm and 3 mm thick 50x300 mm[.sup]2[/] large 
plates, for exploration of the fatigue fracture micromechanisms 
during steady crack growth and during accelerated crack growth. 
All mechanical tests were performed at 20C temperature. 
Microstructural examination was done under a Neophot-3 optical 
microscope, under a JEM-200 electron emission microscope by the 
method of replicas, and under a JSM-U3 scanning electron 
microscope. Specimens for this examination were electropolished 
with an electrolyte containing 1 g CrO[.sub]3[/] + 65 ml 
H[.sub]3[/]PO[.sub]4[/] + 15 ml 
H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] and etched with an 
HNO[.sub]3[/]:HCl= 3:1 mixture. Particular attention was paid 
to the zone of intense plastic deformation at the tip of a 
growing fatigue crack, metallographic examination having 
revealed here pores and discrete discontinuities along the grain 
boundary. The results of this study, including diagrams of 
fatigue fracture kinetics based on the test data, correlate with 
the hypothesis of fractal geometry in nature (B.B. Mandelbrot, 
1984) and the theory of self-organized criticality (P. Bak, K. 
Chen; V MIRE NAUKI, No. 3, 1991.). The authors thank L.G. Orlov 
for helping with microstructural examination. Figures 6; tables

  [Abstract] A study examined the mechanical and 
technological properties of construction steels subjected to 
thermomechanical treatment to the point of transformation to a 
perlite structure. Ingots weighing 35 kg were smelted in an 
induction furnace and and forged into 35-mm-thick flatbars that 
were then subjected to thermomechanical treatment to the point 
where a perlite structure was produced. The flatbars were rolled 
in six passes to a thickness of 12 mm with a total relative 
reduction of about 66 percent. The flatbars were subjected to 
thermomechanical treatment in one of two versions. In the first 
version the flatbars were heated to 1,200C and held in the 
furnace, deformed in rolling cages until they had reached a 
temperature of 780C, and then annealed in a heat-treating 
furnace to a temperature of 600C (duration, 1.5 hours). In 
the second regimen the flatbars were heated to 1,000C, 
deformed in rolling cages until they had reached a temperature 
of 650C, and annealed in a heat-treating furnace at 
650C for 2 hours. In both cases the flatbars developed a 
perlite microstructure with globular carbides that possessed 
increased ductility. The structure of the globular carbides 
produced is optimum for steels subjected to cold deformation 
during the manufacturing process; however, its machineability is 
not as good as that achieved by other methods. The flatbars 
produced by the second regimen were more ductile than those 
produced by the first regimen. The second regimen resulted in 
steels with an evenly distributed granular perlite, whereas the 
first regimen resulted in perlite that had only been 80-90 
percent spheroidized (thus resulting in free ferrite in the 
steel's microstructure). Further studies were conducted to 
clarify the effect that the microstructure formed during the 
thermomechanical treatment to the perlite stage has on the 
mechanical properties of steel after additional hardening heat 
treatment (hardening with high-temperature tempering). Specimens 
of 38KhGNM and 40KhN2MA steel were subjected to thermomechanical 
treatment in the perlite range followed by hardening heat 
treatment under commercial conditions (halting rolling at 
800C, after which the billets were cooled down in air to 
650C before being put into the furnace for the perlite 
transformation). The specimens subjected to preliminary 
thermomechanical treatment in the perlite range proved more 
resistant to impact bending failure in both hardened and 
tempered states. Figures 3, tables 2; references 4: 3 Russian, 1

J/mm[.sup]2[/]). The focal spot measured 4.0 mm in diameter. 
Polished microsections made perpendicular to the irradiated 
surface were used to study the specimens' microstructure on a 
DRON-2.0 diffractometer. The specimens were also subjected to 
x-ray phase analysis. Irradiation of the laser-treated specimens 
at W[.sub]E[/] = 0.5 J/mm[.sup]2[/] did not result in any 
noticeable change in the appearance of their anode 
potentiodynamic curves as compared with those of the starting 
steel. After irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 2.5-2.95 
J/mm[.sup]2[/], the carbide peak shifted to the left, and 
after irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.25-3.50 
J/mm[.sup]2[/], the ``classic'' form of anode potentiodynamic 
curve similar to the ideal curve of _a_-iron was observed. The 
unevenness of the distribution of the energy of the laser 
irradiation throughout the area of the focal spot and the 
superimposition of heat-affected zones on one another (resulting 
in repeated irradiation of selected sections of the steel 
surface) had a significant effect on the structure and phase 
composition of the irradiated surface. In addition, 
metallographic analysis confirmed the definite electrochemical 
effect of the dissolution of the carbide phase: After 
irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.25 J/mm[.sup]2[/], no 
carbide phase was detected in the surface layer, and after 
irradiation at W[.sub]E[/] = 3.65 J/mm[.sup]2[/], the 
surface was observed to have vitrified (thus indicating that 
such a laser treatment regimen is unacceptable for treating 
finished instruments). The biggest increase in hardness of the 
steel's surface layer (to 800 H) was achieved upon total 
dissolution of the carbide phase. Analysis of the change in the 
width of the diffraction peaks recorded for the study specimens 
indicated that as W[.sub]E[/] increases, the width of 
B[.sub](110)_a_[/] remains virtually unchanged whereas that 
of B[.sub](220)_a_[/] increases. This increase in 
microstresses was hypothesized to be at least partly due to the 
presence of the chemical inhomogeneity of the solid solution 
that develops during the process of dissolution of the carbide 
phase. The studies performed thus established the possibility of 
controlling the regimens used to treat medical instruments so as 
to increase their microhardness to 800 H without changing the 
geometry of their cutting edges. Figure 1, tables 2; references 
11 (Russian).

621.7.044:625.143.4] 
  [Abstract] A technology of local hardening has been 
developed for the purpose of increasing the fatigue strength of 
railroad tracks in the vulnerable zone of bolt holes, namely by 
treating the quenched high-carbon M76 steel (0.71-0.82% 
C) rail 
steel with a detonation wave. In the experimental stage shock 
waves were generated by detonation of friable explosives 
(cyclonite, ammonite) and plastic explosives (seismoplast), the 
fuse cord passing axisymmetrically through the center of the 
bolt for either unilateral or bilateral hardening. Hardening 
tests were performed on 600 mm long rail segments with one 
drilled bolt hole 65 mm in diameter. Subsequent fatigue tests 
were performed in a TsDM-200/400 hydraulic vibrator under a 
cyclic flexural load alternating at a frequency of 5 Hz with a 
700 kN amplitude and a 0.1 asymmetry index. The test base for 
the endurance limit was 2x10[.sup]6[/] cycles, cracking 
around the bolt hole in unhardened control specimens having 
begun already after 2x[.sup]5[/] cycles. Metallographic 
examination was performed under an MIM-8 optical microscope and 
in a ``Camebax'' microanalyzer. An analysis of the results 
indicates that there does not exist a one-to-one dependence of 
the rail life on the thickness h and/or the microhardness H of 
the thus hardened layer, but that the fatigue strength depends 
inversely on the hardenining gradient G= dH/dh: more uniform 
hardening (smaller gradient) results in a higher endurance limit 
and thus a longer life of bolted rails. A set of metal in excess 
of 0.3% evidently causes both microcracking and 
macrocracking. 
Optimum hardening with minimum roughness of the hole edges was 
attained by simultaneous bilateral detonation of seismoplast 
with a fuse cord. Figures 5; tables 1; references 8.

  [Abstract] Since pipe fittings 10-25 mm in diameter made 
from rods of 25Cr17Ni2Nb-Sh ball bearing steel 
(0.22-0.28% C, 
16-17.7 % Cr, 2.3-2.8 % Ni, 0.05-0.1 % Nb, 
0.30-0.7 % Mn, 
0.30-0.70 % Si,  0.015 % S,  0.008 
% P) for high-pressure 
conduits are being joined to the main by electrical brazing with 
a high-frequency current, it has been found necessary to 
determine the causes of embrittlement during that process. Two 
kinds of specimens were prepared for the study: 1) smooth rods 6 
mm in diameter with a neck 4 mm in diameter formed by cutting a 
notch; 2) smooth rods 6 mm in diameter without a notch. Some 
specimens of each kind were produced from blanks according to 
scheme A: heat treating the blanks by quenching from 980C + 
tempering at 700C, then machining them on the lathe with 
attendant formation of a cold-hardened layer. Other specimens of 
each kind were produced according to scheme B: machining 
annealed blanks on the lathe, then heat treating the finished 
rods by quenching from 1000C under vacuum + tempering at 
710C. The initial hardness of all specimens was 31.8 
Rockwell C. Also tubular specimens with a 15 mm inside diameter 
and a 5 mm wall thickness were prepared, according to scheme A. 
Mechanical tests and microstructural examination identified 
stress concentrators such as nonmetallic inclusions and 
cold-hardening as the causes of embrittlement. Simulation of the 
brazing process with inclusion of subsequent cooling in air or 
in a copper ``refrigerator'' revealed no anomalous changes in 
the impact strength and thus no temper embrittlement of 
specimens with a crack which had been quenched in oil and 
subsequently tempered to various hardness numbers within the 
25-35.8 Rockwell C range. Overheating during brazing was, 
however, found to increase the degree of embrittlement almost 
linearly with rising temperature: from 2.6% at 755C 
(A[.sub]c1[/]) to 28.6% at 860C (A[.sub]c3[/]. 
Recommendations for abating embrittlement of pipe fittings made 
of this steel are: designing them with large fillet radii, 
producing them in accordance with scheme B, and brazing them on 
at temperatures not higher than 800C. Figures 2; tables 3; 
references 2.

  [Abstract] An experimental study of austenitic stainless 
steel 12Cr18Ni10Ti ( 0.12% C, 17-19 % Cr, 
9-11 % Ni, 0.8 % 
Ti)was made concerning its dynamic recrystallization under 
compression at high temperatures. Industrial specimens 15 mm 
long and 10 mm in diameter were loaded in an Instron machine 
while being heated by the SiC element of a laboratory furnace. 
The strain rate was varied over the 10[.sup]-4[/]- 
10[.sup]-2[/] s[.sup]-1[/] range in discrete 10 % steps. 
The temperature was varied over the T= 800-1000C range, 
specimens being heated not longer than 10 minutes and sprayed 
with cooling water as the load was being removed. The 
sensitivity of the yield stress _s_ to change of the strain 
rate 
d_e_/dt was calculated as the ratio of log(_s_[.sub]2[/]/ 
_s_[.sub]1[/] to 
log[(d_e_/dt][.sub]2[/]/(d_e_/dt)[.sub]1[/]]. The apparent 
energy Q of plastic flow activation was determined from the 
slope of the log(d_e_) - 1/t diagram and the z-parameter was 
calculated according to the z= (d_e_/dt)e[.sup]Q/RT[/] 
relation (Q= 495 kJ/mole, R- gas constant, T- temperature). 
Metallographic examination was performed in an ``Epiquant'' 
structure analyzer and the dislocation structure was examined 
under a JEM-2000EX emission electron microscope. The 
stress-strain curves indicate the existence of three 
``temperature - strain rate'' regions characterized each by 
different recrystallization dynamics: In region A (T= 
800-900C, d_e_/dt &gt;  10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) 
deformation is attended by softening after the yield stress _s_ 
has peaked under a _e_= 20% strain. In region B (T= 
900C, 
d_e_/dt &lt; 10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) the yield stress 
oscillates, the amplitude of its oscillations decreasing with 
increasing strain. In region C (T= 1000C, d_e_/dt &lt; 
10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) the yield stress _s_ does not 
peak and the strain remains constant after hardening. The 
results indicate that the kinetics of microstructural changes 
during hot deformation of this steel depend on the mechanisms of 
the preceding deformations and particularly on the slip pattern. 
The parameters of the new structure formed in the process, 
namely its grain size and recrystallization volume, depend 
accordingly on the z-parameter characterizing the deformation 
process conditions in terms of temperature and strain rate: both 
parameters becoming larger when the z-parameter is increased. 
When z is very large and the number of slip patterns is limited, 
then strong local deformation takes place and dynamic 
recrystallization is effected by fragmentation of grains 
followed by fissure of the fragments. As the strain increases, 
the yield stress becomes more sensitive to change of the strain 
rate, dynamic recrystallization thus controlling the yield 
stress. Figures 5; tables 1; references 6.

  [Abstract] Pipes made of the titanium alloy PT-7M (titanium 
plus 1.8-2.5 percent Al, 2-3 percent Zr, and 0.1 percent C) with 
a diameter of 13 mm and wall thickness of 1.5 mm were subjected 
to fatigue tests under a variable-sign load in a fixed plane on 
resonance-type units with electromagnetic excitation of 
vibrations. During the testing each pipe was bent like a beam on 
two supports under the effect of a running inertial load, 
inertia forces, and inertial moments of additional weights 
attached on its brackets. The span of each test pipe segment 
measured 520 mm, and the gradient of the bending moment on the 
section of likely fracture (about one-fourth of the span) did 
not exceed 0.1 percent/mm of the bending moment in the 
midsection. A loading frequency of 100 Hz, a symmetrical cycle 
with a constant deformation amplitude, and a test base of 
10[.sup]8[/] cycles were used. The error in measuring the 
deformation amplitudes did not exceed +/-5 percent, and the 
temperature regimen conformed to the requirements stipulated in 
state standard GOST 25.502-79. Fifteen series of 15 specimens 
were tested. The titanium alloy's notch sensitivity was found to 
increase somewhat as the temperature increased. At T = 20C, 
the effective notch-sensitivity index concentration 
K[.sub]eff[/] equaled 2.53 versus 3.13 and 2.77 at T = 250 
and 350C, respectively. An average value of 
K[.sub]eff[/] = 2.81 was assumed. (The maximum value of the 
theoretical notch-sensitivity for a stretched wafer of linearly 
elastic material is K[.sub]eff[/] = 3.) As the temperature 
was increased, the titanium alloy pipes' ``sensitivity'' to 
absorption of hydrogen (relative decrease in _s_[.sub]-1[/] 
as the hydrogen content increases) decreased. It was suggested 
that the test results summarized in table form be used to 
estimate the lifetime of equipment containing pipes made of 
PT-7M titanium alloy by hypothesizing the linear summation of 
instances of fatigue. Figures 2, table 1; references 5 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Specimens of R-6Mo5Co5 high-speed cutting tool 
steel were coated by the ion-plasma process with Ti, V, Cr 
nitrides and various combinations of them, the process involving 
condensation from the plasma phase with attendant ion 
bombardment. Deposition of titanium nitride coatings was 
preceded by preliminary deposition of titanium on the steel 
surface. Subsequent processing was done with the steel substrate 
at a temperature within 550+/-25C and the nitrogen pressure 
within 0.25-0.28 Pa, with the bias potential held constant at 
100 V and the current varied over the 75-125 A range. The phase 
composition of the coatings was analyzed in a DRON-3M x-ray 
diffractometer with Cu-K[.sub]_a_[/] and Co-K[.sub]_a_[/] 
radiation sources, the results revealing the presence of 
0.02-1.0% Fe,Mo,Co,W,Si from the steel. An x-ray 
structural 
examination revealed, moreover, not only TiN with a b.c.c. 
crystal lattice (parameter a= 0.4241 nm) but also up to 8% 
_a_-Ti phase which had formed during the preliminary deposition 
of titanium. An x-ray spectrum microanalysis was performed with 
an electronic probe in a ``Cam-Scan'' analyzer. The relative 
nitrogen content in the coatings was measured using a 
TiN[.sub]0.06[/] reference specimen. The coatings were tested 
for abrasion resistance in dry sliding friction, a 2500 m long 
path being covered at a velocity of 1.1 m/s and the amount of 
wear being measured by the loss-of-mass method. The heat 
resistance of coated steel was estimated from the change of mass 
as specimens were soaking in air at 600C. Microbrittleness 
of the coatings was measured with a PMT-3 microhardness tester, 
the ratio of indentations with cracks to the total number of 
indentations being thus estimated and the behavior of cracked 
indentations being tracked as the load was increased from 0.196 
N to 1.96 N. Examination of chromium nitride coatings revealed 
74% Cr[.sub]2[/]N and 26 % CrN, also traces of chromium 

which had formed a 0.4 m thick underlayer after its 
preliminary deposition. Examination of vanadium nitride coatings 
revealed traces of vanadium accompanying the principal phase VN 
with a b.c.c. crystal lattice (parameter a= 0.4123). Coatings of 
(Ti+Cr) nitrides were found to have a b.c.c. crystal lattice and 
a nonstoichiometric composition corresponding to 
(Ti,Cr)N[.sub]0.47[/]: isomorph of TiN and CrN mononitrides 
rather Ti and Cr dinitrides, despite the low (32 atom%) 
nitrogen content. Coatings of (V+Cr) nitrides consisted of 
79-80% (V,Cr)[.sub]2[/]N and 11-21% (V,Cr)N, both phases 

having a b.c.c. crystal lattice. The results of mechanical tests 
indicate that these coatings have a higher heat resistance and a 
higher wear resistance than TiN and (Ti,Cr) coatings, also when 
deposited on Ti-W 22 titanium alloy and on 12Cr18Ni10Ti steel.

  [Abstract] Methods of intensifying hydrometallurgical 
processes currently used in the nonferrous industry and 
unconventional methods of accelerating lixivation of raw 
minerals are reviewed on the basis of recent research done at 
the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys. As the point of 
departure is considered the classical relation da/dt= 
(+/-)KC[.sup]n[/]S (a- degree of conversion, t- time, S- area 
of interphase boundary, C- concentration of reactant of 
component, n- order of process with respect to reactant or 
component, K= Ae[.sup]-E/RT[/]- empirically determined 
process rate constant, E- activation energy, R- universal gas 
constant, T- temperature, A- coefficient) describing lixivation, 
crystallization, cementation, and ion exchange processes. Use of 
_g_-radiation from sources such as [.sup]60[/]Co or [.sup]137[/] 
Cs for radiolysis of water intensifies 
oxidation-dissolution of uranium and its use for electrolysis or 
photolysis of Eu salts (sulfate) intensifies 
reduction-precipitation for separation of Eu from other 
rare-earth elements. Ultrasonic processing of ionite intensifies 
ion exchange. Ultrasound is also used for completing lixivation 
of Pb cake by dissolution of Zn,In,Cd admixtures and for 
overcoming barriers which limit chemical reactions such as 
A(solid) + B(in solution) C(solid) + D(in solution) by 
limiting internal diffusion through solid product layers. A 
simpler new method of overcoming these barriers during 
lixivation of ores and concentrates has been proposed by the 
authors, namely implantation of additives in the pulp which will 
act as crystallization centers. Such an additive should contain 
calcite or preferably dolomite for lixivation of scheelite with 
soda in an autoclave, or tungstic acid (powder) for 
decomposition of scheelite with nitric acid. Lixivation of Pb 
cake and of concentrates with more precious contents is also 
being intensified by mechanical activation: in centrifugal 
planetary grinding mill with drums which rotate both about their 
common axis and in the opposite sense about their own axes. 
Modification of minerals such as wolframite scheelite during 
comminution is being intensified either by mechanochemical 
activation, namely addition of a calcium salt, or by thermal 
activation into the phase-transformation range and subsequent 
quenching. Cementation of metals such as Cd and Cu is being 
intensified by mechanical activation in a continuous-action 
vibratory reactor. Figures 5; bibliography will be included in 
next part of this article.

along with negative and positive technological aspects of the 
process. The results of experiments with pulsed 
CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers indicate that formation of a plasma above 
metal surfaces in air requires a radiation of only about 10 
MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in pulses of about 1 s duration 
and of only 0.1-1 MW/cm[.sup]2[/] intensity in millisecond 
pulses, while breaking down air in the absence of metal surfaces 
requires as much as 1-10 GW/cm[.sup]2[/]. Two characteristic 
target temperatures have been defined as parameters of the 
initial thermal interaction: temperature T* of complete 
vaporization and temperature T[.sub]b[/] of boiling or 
sublimation under a given pressure of the ambient gas. The 
energy relations during thermal stage of target heating to 
vaporization and the subsequent stage of vapor ionization are 
examined theoretically with the support of experimental data, 
for the purpose of determining the threshold laser radiation 
intensity and the threshold energy density at the target 
surface. Inasmuch as both threshold depend on the mode of 
surface plasma formation, the following ones are considered 
here: S- by heating of the entire target surface, MD- by heating 
of thermally insulated microdefects, A- by heating and 
vaporization of aerosol, VGM- by ionization of the target vapor 
mixed with ambient gas in the diffusion mode, EF- 
hydrodynamically in the presence of an erosion flare. The review 
covers plasma formation in these modes above ideally smooth 
surfaces of many metals ranging from fusible ones (Zn,Pb) to 
refractory ones (W,Ta) including brass, also of carbon and 
several oxides (alumina, silica), above surfaces of 
nonhomogeneous materials such as aluminum alloys with solid 
inclusions of intermetallic compounds, above microdefective 
surfaces, and above rough surfaces. Analysis of surface plasma 
formation in vapor-gas mixtures in the diffusion mode after 
heating of the entire target surface (S-VGM) are considered two 
models: quasi-steady vapor distribution within a cloud of finite 
dimensions and nonsteady vapor distribution within a cloud in 
statu nascendi, atomic and molecular ambient gases being 
considered. Analysis of surface plasma in the hydrodynamic mode 
in the presence of an erosion flare is based on the model of 
vapor breakdown by a ``heat absorption spike'' or the model of 
``avalanche ionization'' in gas layers at the target surface. 
Despite the subjectivity of researchers and not always 
consistent research data, the thresholds of surface plasma 
formation by laser radiation pulses have been in many cases 
correctly estimated. Figures 15; tables 5; references 155.

  [Abstract] A scientific conference was held on 30 December 
1992 by the Department of General Physics and Astronomy of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences at its Institute of Problems in 
Physics imeni P.L. Kapitsa. Three lectures on the topic of 
femtosecond pulses and their usefulness in physics were given: 
  1. ``Current Trends in Research on Femtosecond Pulses and 
Possibilities of Their Use in Experimental Studies Pertaining to 
Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics'' by P.G. Kryukov; 
  2. ``Nonlinear Propagation of Femtosecond Pulses Through 
Fiber-Optic Waveguides'' by Ye.M. Dianov, A.M. Prokhorov, and 
V.N. Serkin; 
  3. ``Generation of Ultrahigh-Intensity Optical Fields by 
Powerful Femtosecond Laser Systems Including Excimer-Laser 
Amplifiers and Experiments Relating to Emission of Ultrashort 
X-Ray Pulses'' by V.M. Gordiyenko, N.I. Koroteyev, and V.T. 
Platonenko. 
  In this report is summarized the content of the third 
lecture, which relates to development of ``desktop'' terawatt 
lasers emitting femtosecond radiation pulses of only 0.01-1 J 
energy. The mechanism of the process includes ``inertial 
conservation'' of the laser-induced plasma during its expansion, 
heat transfer deeper into the target mainly by diffusion being 
the main factor which limits the plasma temperature. When the 
radiation intensity exceeds the 
10[.sup]18-[/]-10[.sup]19[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/], then light 
pressure exceeds thermodynamic pressure while the plasma 
temperature climbs to thousands of electron-volts and the 
electron concentration reaches 10[.sup]23[/]-10[.sup]24[/] 
cm[.sup]-3[/] under pressures of 10-100 Mbar. Under these 
conditions the motion of free electrons shifts into the 
relativistic mode, which imparts unique properties to a 
femtosecond surface plasma so that it becomes a new object of 
basic research. This applies particularly to the electrodynamics 
of interaction of high-intensity radiation and a rapidly 
expanding steep high-temperature plasma front, also to the 
emission of x-rays by such a plasma. The laser facility built at 
the Moscow State University under the late S.A. Akhmanov 
includes solid-state visible lasers with a 1-10 GW power rating 
and an molecular XeCl excimer laser with a 10-100 GW power 
rating which emit 570-630 nm radiation and 308 nm radiation 
respectively, in pulses of about 40 fs duration. Proper focusing 
makes attainable a radiation intensity even higher than 
10[.sup]16[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/] at the target surface. Owing 
to the low optical density of a surface plasma, most of its 
x-ray emission energy lines within the resonance lines of its 
ions. With the aid of multilayer resonance mirrors it therefore 
becomes possible to extract strong narrow-band x-ray pulses and 
especially so from plasmas with hydrogen-like or helium-like 
ions. Theoretical analysis of the x-ray emission mechanism 
indicates that thin-film targets of about 100 nm thickness form 
laser-induced plasmas which make effective sources of hard 
x-rays. In this the heat is retained at the target, because the 
dissipation mechanism is inactive here, so that a less than 
usual intensity of the ``heating'' laser beam will be adequate.

  [Abstract] Computations of the potential of a deuteron and 
the probability of the reaction of cold nuclear fusion of 
deuterium in the compound TiD[.sub]2[/] and in its alloys 
with elements of a 3d-period were made. The role of diffusion 
and phase processes in the synthesis of deuterium nuclei is 
statistically interpreted. On this basis a method is proposed 
for examining the state of a deuteron in a solid, making it 
possible to define a number of aspects which must be taken into 
account in subsequent research. In itself the solid is a 
significant factor reducing the Coulomb barrier of the deuteron. 
The screening effect itself is stable relative to the change in 
composition and external hydrostatic pressure, but does not 
ensure the probability of nuclear fusion even at the Jones 
level. Results are given providing a basis for assuming that the 
high mobility of deuterons in a solid, the band character of 
their motion and the active response to external fields are 
together capable of ensuring the necessary orders of the 
reaction rate. The formulation of a uniform model of cold 
nuclear fusion must therefore be based on the combined screening 
of d-d interaction under conditions when nonequilibrium 
processes prevail. Particular attention must be given to 
directed fluxes of deuterons along definite crystallographic 
directions for which resonance interaction effects are possible. 
The appearance of experimental data on buildup as a result of 
the cold nuclear fusion reaction of helium and tritium indicates 
that a solid also may exert an influence on the nuclear reaction 
mechanism itself. It is possible that a definite role in this 
case is played by steep gradients of electric fields already 
measured, for example, for palladium hydride. References 32: 16

  [Abstract] Recuperation of the plasma energy in fusion 
reactors by direct thermonuclear-to-electric energy conversion 
is considered, a method of connecting the recuperator trap to a 
closed dragon trap being proposed which is simpler than the 
conventional use of a bundle diverter. The recuperator is a 
curvilinear adiabatic trap which contains a mirror machine 
identical to those in the dragon trap. The method of connecting 
the two traps utilizes the peculiarities of plasma diffusion 
within the dragon, the latter confining three groups of charged 
particles: 1) drift particles in its toroidal segments, 2) 
``superbanana'' particles confined between locks in its 
curvilinear collision-radiative electron lenses, 3) particles 
confined in its axisymmetric mirror machines. The key to the 
proposed method are the different modes of their diffusion, 
those restrained in a mirror machine diffusing in the classical 
mode across the magnetic field while drift and ``superbanana'' 
particles setting in the toroidal dragon segments diffuse in the 
neoclassical mode. Diffusion of electrons and of ions is 
analyzed quantitatively according to theory. The relevant plasma 
parameters are evaluated on the premise that the frequency of 
ion-ion collisions is always lower than the frequency of 
electron-electron collisions owing to heavier mass of ions. A 
recuperator has two electrodes mounted one at each end for 
extraction of electric energy. The confining magnetic field is 
the one between the electron lenses in the dragon. During the 
recuperation process charged particles become quickly confined 
in the mirror machines of the dragon and are drifting here in 
crossed fields from the center of the dragon outward. 
Recuperation requires that particles have more energy for l 
longitudinal motion than for transverse motion, in which case 
``superbanana'' particles in the mirror machines become 
converted into drift particles. These are then recuperated by 
means of electrodes inserted into the locks of the mirror 
machines, relocating the electrodes into these locks from locks 
in the electron lenses having simplified the device and reduced 
its size. The particularly important initial stage of the 
recuperation process is analyzed on the basis of two equations, 
one relating the rate of change of kinetic energy to the 
electric potential gradient and one representing the law of 
magnetic momentum conservation. Separately is considered 
rotational conversion of energy and its effect on the 
recuperation process, whereupon an approximate expression is 
derived for the efficiency of recuperation in such a system. The 
authors thank V.V. Arsenin, I.N. Golovin, and V.D. Shafran for 
discussion. Figures 2; references 7.

  [Abstract] Breakdown of metal targets by high-intensity ion 
beams and the dynamics of stressed state formation in targets 
during their bombardment by proton beams are analyzed by 
mathematical simulation. Interactions of high-intensity ion 
beams and target material not resulting in high-temperature 
heating of the plasma corona are considered so that preheating 
of the target can be disregarded. Correspondingly is considered 
interaction of high-energy (about 10 MeV) proton beams incident 
on solid targets in short pulses of up to 100 ns duration. The 
nonsteady flow of target material under an incident 
high-intensity ion beam is calculated in the hydrodynamic 
approximation in accordance with the three applicable 
integrodifferential equations of mass, momentum, and energy 
conservation. The elastoplastic characteristics are evaluated in 
accordance with the Mises model. The simulation program includes 
a two-dimensional ``flow of continuous medium'' algorithm in 
Lagrangian coordinates, constructed according to the explicit 
``cross'' scheme and involving the ``predictor-corrector'' 
procedure of second-order precision. Oscillations of nonphysical 
quantities are prevented by insertion of an artificial viscosity 
into both tensor and scalar forms. The breakdown model is based 
on the kinetic description of crack formation as a defect 
buildup process and attendant weakening of the material, the 
system of its equations being closed by an equation of state 
which covers not only a large class of materials but also wide 
temperature and pressure ranges up to extremely high ones. The 
deformation resistance increases with increasing intensity of 
the compression shock and reflection of the latter gives rise to 
a rarefaction wave, the tensile stresses in latter disrupting 
the continuity of the material. Numerical calculations on the 
basis of this model have been made for an aluminum target and 
two different high-intensity ion beams delivering the same total 
energy to the target: 1) thin tubular beam about 0.5 mm wide 
with the maximum current density at the 1 mm radius, 2) solid 
cylindrical beam with a Gaussian radial distribution of the 
current density peaking at the 0.5 mm radius. For 
simplification, the kinetic energy of protons is assumed to 
remain constant at the 10 MeV level over the duration of an 
incident pulse. An important parameter included in the 
calculations is the strain rate characterizing the response of a 
target to an incident shock wave. The results indicate that both 
the evolving stressed state of a target and the degree of its 
breakdown depend largely on the configuration of the focal 
radiation spot, a tubular beam producing defects over a larger 
target area. A high-energy proton beam evidently forms a large 
region of lower-density material surrounded by higher-density 
condensate, both temperature and pressure in this region rising 
appreciably within the Bragg peak deeper inside the target.

  [Abstract] The flow of a boiling coolant through parallel 
heat exchanger channels in a reactor core is analyzed for 
stability on the basis of the 1P2T1W (P-pressure, T-temperatures 
of liquid and vapor respectively, W-velocity). The equations of 
this mathematical model are one-dimensional first-order partial 
differential equations describing the flow of kinetics of a 
two-phase stream including its one-phase segment and the laws of 
mass-energy-momentum conservation in such a channel with 
appropriate boundary conditions. These equations are integrated 
numerically by the method of finite differences, the four sought 
variables being: pressure, temperature of the liquid, velocity 
of the stream, and the volume fraction of vapor. Friction at the 
channel walls is described by simple correlations for a 
homogeneous liquid, as a function of the Reynolds number. The 
interphase heat transfer is assumed to be sufficiently intense 
for disregarding the small thermal unbalance between the phases. 
The boundary conditions are: constant pressure at the outlet; 
given temperature and flow rate of entering coolant. Both bubble 
boiling and film boiling during the flow are considered, the 
boundary between both modes in the stream being defined in terms 
of the critical heat flux as a function of the mass fraction of 
vapor within its subcritical range. Calculations made without 
applying the Courant condition reveal an onset of instability 
and its subsequent evolution by a mechanism associated with heat 
load changes under a constant pressure head and the consequences 
thereof. As stabilizing factors are identified friction at the 
wall and heat transfer from it to the entering one-phase stream 
segment. The combination of these factors with thermal inertia 
of channel wall, hydrodynamic losses due to flow rate and 
attendant density perturbations as well as due to friction and 
internal drag within the two-phase stream segment will determine 
the flow dynamics. The adiabatic one-phase stream segment is 
replaced with an equivalent hydrodynamic drag element. Both 
heated and two-phase stream segments are subdivided into equally 
thick discrete slices. The calculations have been made for an 
actual system with a circulation pump and six parallel identical 
parallel heat exchanger channels between a common collector 
followed by six throttles and a common separator for preceded by 
six throttles, the coolant flowing as follows: 1. liquid 
entering the collector, 2. liquid-vapor mixture entering the 
separator, 3. liquid alone returns to the pump after passage 
through the heat exchanger. The stabilizing effect of a digital 
Bernoulli flow rate meter on the inlet side has also been 
evaluated, on the basis of calculation of the flow rate as a 
function time with and without such a device in the circulation 
loop. Figures 6; references 24.

  [Abstract] A problem in recording, with a receiver on 
ground, the heat radiated by turbulent jets of gaseous molecular 
combustion products in space upon its passage through a 
turbulent atmosphere is the effect of atmospheric fluctuations 
on readings. This effect is evaluated theoretically on the basis 
of the Reardon multigroup model by a method which takes into 
account the contribution of ``hot'' lines. In that model lines 
within some region of the spectrum are replaced with groups of 
lines differing only in their excitation energy levels, which 
are multiples of the ground-state vibrational quantum in 
molecules of the gas. The mean radiation intensity within a 
finite range of the spectral band characterizing the gas is, in 
the case of Lorentz broadening of spectral lines, calculated by 
representing the one-point probability density distribution 
functions as superpositions of three -functions. Such 
calculations have been made for a jet of a gaseous 
H[.sub]2[/]O + CO[.sub]2[/] + CO mixture with the 
respective partial pressures 0.041 atm, 0.033 atm, 0.003 atm and 
the temperature 850 K at the throat of a 20 cm in diameter 
nozzle. The results indicate that in the case of H[.sub]2[/] 
and CO[.sub]2[/] combustion products turbulent atmospheric 
temperature and density fluctuations must be accounted for in 
the Wien region of the radiation spectrum. The effect of these 
fluctuations on the emitted radiation is strongest where their 
amplitude is largest and where the jet temperature is 
approximately twice the ambient one, typically at the jet edges 
and in the transition segment. Tables 3; references 25.

  [Abstract] The technology and characteristics of glass 
diagnostic targets with a Eu admixture are described. The 
superiority of Eu for this purpose over other alternatives is 
discussed. The targets are intended for the calibration of a 
collector in measurements of the product of the density of a 
compressed target and its radius in experiments with 
laser-driven fusion. The apparatus and procedures for preparing 
the glass microspheres used in this work are examined and the 
necessary qualities of these microspheres are defined. A 
combination of Eu in the forms Eu[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] or 
Eu(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/] with citric acid was selected 
for the production of microspheres 100-250 m in diameter 
with 
a wall thickness 0.5-2 m. The parameters and procedures for 
microsphere irradiation are given. The necessity for a 
uniformity of Eu distribution in the glass of each microsphere 
is stressed. It was found that the introduction of Eu into a 
solution of liquid glass in the form of a citrate complex makes 
it possible to fabricate microtargets from glass with acceptable 
geometric parameters. Adequate concentrations of Eu and the 
uniformity of its distributions make these targets suitable for 
use for diagnostic purposes in experiments with laser-driven 
fusion. Figures 2; references 7: 4 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Noise in SQUIDS built with high-T[.sub]c[/] 
superconductors and operating at radio frequencies is analyzed, 
of specific concern here being the effect of flicker 
fluctuations of the critical current in the nonlinear Josephson 
junction on the 1/f noise in such a SQUID and the dependence of 
its spectral density on the mode of SQUID operation. The 
interferometer is inductively coupled to a LC oscillator-pump 
tank circuit with a shunting resistance R. The analysis is based 
on four equations: 1) one for the magnetic flux in the 
interferometer, which consists of a signal flux and an 
``external'' flux; 2) one for the Josephson current, which 
consists of a fluctuation component and a supercurrent in 
addition to the (h/2eR)_P_ current (h- Planck's constant, e- 
electron mass, R- oscillator resistance, _P_- total magnetic 
flux normalized to a flux quantum, displacement current 
negligible at low frequencies; 3-4 oscillator equations for the 
voltage across it and the total current in it respectively. 
Inasmuch as the inductance of a SQUID is usually very low, its 
static _P_(_P_[.sub]ext[/]) interferometer diagram is 
calculated on the basis of the threshold model (K.K. Likharev; 
Introduction to Dynamics of Josephson Junctions, Izd. Nauka 
1985), which includes a hysteresis loop consisting of linear 
segments, whereupon the performance of such a SQUId is analyzed 
again for noise, this time taking into account that hysteresis.

  [Abstract] This article develops a numerical algorithm to 
model electromagnetic fields (magnetotelluric sounding) in 
quasi-stratified media using three-dimensional potentials. The 
quasi-stratified medium is considered to be a conducting 
structure consisting of homogeneous layers of variable 
thickness. Outside the local anomalous area the medium is a 
plane-parallel stratified medium with a normal electric 
conductivity distribution. When the algorithm is used in 
magnetotelluric sounding, the impedance of the field at the 
Earth's surface is measured over a wide range of frequencies. 
Thus, the electrodynamic problem must be solved for a large 
number of wavelengths, which takes a great deal of processor 
time. A method is presented to reduce this by a factor of five. 
The algorithm is written in FORTRAN 77 for an IBM PC/AT 
computer. Figures 2; references 14: 10 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Abstract]An optimum means is proposed to control how a 
search zone is scanned when detecting and tracking the 
trajectory of an individual target when a priori information on 
the type of target is available. The computations which were 
carried out showed that a 20-30% savings in search time is 
obtained as compared to sequential scanning for typical radar 
stations. This value grows proportionately to the number of 
cells in the search zone. 3 figures and 3 references.

  [Abstract]Control using the information function involves a 
ratio analysis after each observation interval in order to 
determine the component amount of information which can provide 
the greatest increase when the controlling parameter values are 
next selected. This means a practical selection of a detection 
mode (detection, tracking, identification) and of controlling 
parameter values which can be changed in real time. When the 
loss function is not specified, control can be found and 
satisfactory results can be obtained using an approach based on 
maximizing the increase in the amount of information at each 
step. 1 figures and 2 references.

  [Abstract]An experiment is conducted to determine the 
directions from which broad band signals arrive when the data 
recording time is short in duration. It was shown that when the 
number of affecting sources is exceeded by the dimensions of the 
signal subspace, this leads to a significant deterioration of 
resolution of the signal group classification method. An 
efficient procedure of direction finding is proposed for the 
indicated conditions. 3 figures and 3 references

  [Abstract]Techniques are described for analyzing and 
designing solid-state active devices within a systems approach. 
Some engineering solutions are examined, as well as attainable 
parameters for modern Hanna diode generators and frequency 
generators in the shortwave portion of the millimeter range 
(_l_ 
= 2 mm). It was found that the field of solid-state active 
devices of extremely high frequencies is a broad one because the 
devices are small in size, and require little energy. In 
particular this applies to their use for radar stations. 1 
figure and 5 references.

  [Abstract]Ratios are examined between the power that is 
dissipated and the power that is absorbed when a random 
conducting antenna loaded with a matched load is irradiated from 
opposite directions. It was shown that with a random aspect to 
the radiation and polarization of the falling wave, the total 
dissipated power is always more or equal to that absorbed when 
the antenna is radiated from the opposite direction by a planar 
electromagnetic wave with coinciding polarization and amplitude. 
Moreover, depending on the nature of the load which ensures a 
minimum effective scattering cross-section, antennas can be 
classified into three categories. In addition, an example of an 
antenna which provides identical reception from any two 
directions is a thin rectilinear dipole antenna. Unlike a 
rectilinear dipole, the majority of antennas have unsymmetrical 
directivity patterns. 2 figures and 8 references.

  [Abstract] Film metal-oxide heterostructures are widely 
used with different electronic devices. In order to develop 
carriers for a vertical magnetic recording, magnetic films based 
on metal oxide heterostructures on aluminum surface have been 
intensely studied for the last several years. The magnetic 
medium with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is realized in 
these film systems by formation of cell structures with 
distributed needle- like particles of ferromagnetic metal. The 
Moessbauer effect offers great potentials for studying these 
films. The objective of this study was, by applying the 
Moessbauer effect, to obtain information on the kinetics of the 
process of filling the cells, or pores, and information about 
the magnetic condition of needle- like particles. The film 
metal-oxide heterostructures were produced by electrochemical 
sedimentation of iron in the pores of the anode oxide film, 
formed on the aluminum surface by anodizing in the sulfuric acid 
electrolyte. The results of Moessbauer measurements demonstrated 
that magnetic and non-magnetic components were present in the 
spectra of all examined samples. The studies also indicate that 
by an appropriate selection of the anodizing condition and 
consecutive sedimentation on the aluminum surface, magnetic 
films, suitable for application in devices with a vertical 
information recording method can be obtained.

  [Abstract] A method for transmission and reconstruction of 
three-dimensional wide aperture images is examined. The essence 
of the method lies in obtaining three-dimensional coordinates, 
brightness and spectral characteristic of object's points, 
aperture of their visibility window and eventual reconstruction 
of a three-dimensional picture as a totality of the object's 
points, where each of them is visible only from its own 
visibility window. This method allows to transmit high quality 
wide-aperture three-dimensional images without significantly 
increasing the bandwidth of the standard TV communication 
channel. This method can be employed with any methods of point- 
by-point scanning or monitoring the scenes. In this article the 
method of horizontal cross sections is examined because, 
compared to other, it requires a minimal bandwidth of the 
communication channel for the information transmission. The 
optical diagram for a possible implementation of the examined 
method is provided. Figure 1, references 9: 5 Russian. 4 Western

  [Abstract] Differentiation of an empirical function 
specified on a grid 
a=x[.sub]1[/]&lt;x[.sub]2[/]&lt;...&lt;x[.sub]n[/]=b is 
incorrectly stated by its measured values f(x[.sub]i[/]), 
i=1,...,n. The incorrectness of the differentiation problem is 
related to violation of the third correctness condition 
according to Adamar - the stability condition. Several methods 
are used for the solution of this problem, including the 
Tikhonov method where the differentiation problem is reduced to 
the solution of the Fredholm equation of the first kind. With 
these methods a stable solution is numerically determined from 
the system of linear algebraic equations. An analytical solution 
of smoothing out and differentiation of empirical data is 
obtained in this paper and the results of numerical experiments 
are provided. References 10: 9 Russian. 1 Western.

  [Abstract] Integrals of function 
f(x[.sub]1[/],...x[.sub]n[/] along straight lines are 
called beam data. If n=2, the beam date correspond with the 
Radon transform ; this case is characteristic for classical 
computer X- ray tomography. Methods of 3-D (n=3) or even 4-D 
(n=4), the fourth coordinate can be time or wavelength with the 
tomography in the optical range. Reconstruction of function f(x) 
from its beam data is the 3-D reconstruction problem. This 
problem is meaningful for any type of tomography. Equations are 
provided for computing the Fourier transformation of uniform, 
generalized functions in a three-dimensional space. These 
formulae allow to construct effective numerical algorithms of 
tomographic 3-D reconstruction from the beam data. References 10

  [Abstract] Geometric aberrations of a lightguide because of 
a nonparallel orientation of its walls have been examined. The 
lightguide consists of a transparent medium bound by two planes. 
The lower plane coincides with the XY plane, the Z axis is 
directed normal to this surface. The upper plane is oriented at 
an angle to the lower, so that it intersects planes ZY and ZX at 
angles _a_ and _g_. The incident light beam lies in a plane 
x=constant, and forms an angle _b_ with the normal to the lower 
plane. If the walls are not parallel, when _a_ and _b_ are 
not 
equal to zero, geometric aberrations are produced, which are 
deviations _D_x[.sub]i[/], _D_y[.sub]i[/] of the 
coordinates of the beam intersection points with the lower plane 
from their value, compared to the ideal case. Computations of 
_D_x, as a function of the number of reflections N for 
different values of parameters _a_ and _g_ were made and the 
results are shown in the graphs. Cases of the light beam 
propagation through a quasi-plane light guide and a case of the 
coordinates deviations _D_x, _D_y from N because of the light 
beam divergence were also examined and the results are provided.

  [Text]Today, the Ukraine possesses a sufficiently high 
economic potential. It has well-developed industry, fertile 
lands, and many mineral resources. Unfortunately, the 
communications industry in the old centralized economic 
management system was financed on what was left over. As a 
result, telephone density in the Ukraine today comprises 16 
telephones per 100 inhabitants, which is almost three times 
lower that the optimal telephone level. We also lag in the 
numbers of radio broadcasting and television programs which the 
population of the country needs for transmitting data at great 
speeds. 
  For the Ukraine to become a state and for its economy to be 
revived, accelerated development of communications equipment is 
needed, especially telecommunications equipment. In order to 
bring the industry up to date and overcome the backwardness 
which has accumulated for many years, the Ukrainian 
Communications Ministry has developed a National Communications 
Development Program to the year 2005. 
  The main goal of the program is to accelerate the 
development of telecommunications networks, including 
long-distance and international networks, telex, a packet 
switching informational network and electronic mail by broadly 
integrating modern digital transmission and switching systems. 
Another goal is to meet the rapidly growing needs of the 
population and government agencies, and to provide the newly 
forming market economic structures with modern communications 
services. 
  The program calls for all urban families to have telephones 
by the year 2005, and 50% of rural families. Within a very 
short time (5-7 years), the construction of modern long-distance 
and international communications networks and data transmission 
networks and the creation of honeycomb mobile communications are 
planned. In order to implement the program, an enormous amount 
of work must be done. It is unthinkable that this work can be 
carried out without focusing the efforts of scientific, 
industrial, construction and service communications enterprises, 
without using modern equipment and technologies, and without 
additional investments, including foreign capital. 
  Historically, the Ukraine found itself in a position in 
which it did not develop or manufacture digital switching and 
transmission systems, nor much other telecommunications 
equipment. 
  As a result of conversion, more than 100 enterprises of 
the military-industrial complex have been converted to the 
production of communications equipment in the past two to three 
years. They were able to arrange the manufacture of 
small-capacity quasi- electronic and electronic automatic 
telephone stations, digital transmission systems for local 
networks, and some other equipment. As far as large-capacity 
digital transmission and switching systems are concerned, it 
would require five to seven years and large financial 
expenditures to develop them, which is hardly justified given 
the existing situation. In this area we cannot manage without 
foreign investments and assistance. This will allow us to buy a 
significant amount of time. 
  Unfortunately, the acquisition of modern communications 
equipment overseas is complicated by the fact that the Ukrainian 
national currency is not convertible at the present time. It is 
impossible to buy this equipment at an exchange rate of one U.S. 
dollar for every 2,000-3,000 coupons, which has been established 
by some commercial banks. If you consider that the average wage 
in the Ukraine at such an exchange rate is only ten dollars, the 
acquisition of equipment overseas makes communications services 
prohibitive for the Ukrainian population. 
  With this in mind, we concluded that it was necessary to 
create joint enterprises for the production of modern equipment 
in the Ukraine. The equipment produced by the joint venture will 
be sold on the internal market with partial payment in 
convertible currency and the national currency. Component parts 
produced in the Ukraine will be used. The creation of centers 
for the generation of software and editions of the software will 
allow the hard currency portion of the cost of these items to be 
significantly reduced. This alternative allows the need for hard 
currency to be significantly reduced for equipment payments. 
This also allows the Ukraine to significantly reduce its 
production by taking into account a share of the cheaper labor 
used for the production of equipment in the Ukraine. Of course, 
according to all economic laws, the manufacture of large lots of 
equipment causes a reduction in prices, and it will be more 
expensive to produce small lots of equipment in the Ukraine. 
However, the inconvertibility of the currency and the high 
exchange rate of dollars to Ukrainian coupons make the proposals 
of local industrial enterprises more attractive. 
  However, for joint enterprises to acquire equipment, a 
certain amount of funds must be in hard currency. The banks (The 
World Bank and the European Bank), from which we had counted on 
receiving credits, drag out the provision of these credits and 
establish many conditions which cannot possible be carried out 
in one year. Time is flying. The lack of a market 
infrastructure, including poorly developed communications, 
prohibits a market economy from developing normally. 
  That is why the Communication Ministry's Concept for 
Attracting Foreign Investments Necessary for the Implementation 
of the National Communications Development Program calls for the 
creation of joint enterprises (operating companies) to develop 
and provide communications services, in addition to the creation 
of joint enterprises with Western firms to produce modern 
communications equipment. This allows results to be seen much 
more quickly, and development with bank credits to take place 
during phase two. 
  Based on this concept, the MKM Telekom joint venture for 
producing EWSD equipment has already been created (the Koroleva 
Production Association and Siemens in the FRG), as well as the 
ChRPZ and AT&amp;T joint venture in Chernigov for producing 5 ESS 
equipment. 
  Preparations are being made at the Odessa Cable Factory to 
jointly produce fiber-optic cables with the U.S. AT&amp;T firm. 
  While the production of equipment was being organized, 
specialists from the Communications Ministry were actively 
searching for Western partners for joint implementation of 
Ukrainian telecommunications development projects. As a result 
of this search, three joint operating enterprises were created: 


    -  UTEL, a Ukrainian-American-Dutch-German enterprise, 
founded by the regional communications administrations of the 
Ukraine together with AT&amp;T, PTT Telecom, and DBP Telecom. By 
the 
year 2005, the joint enterprise should modernize and develop 25 
regional automatic international telephone stations and 
participate in the construction of six million local lines. 
  %UMT, a Ukrainian-Dutch-Danish-German enterprise, 
founded by the regional communications administrations of the 
Ukraine together with PTT Telecom, Denish PPT, and DBP Telecom. 
The joint enterprise should create a honeycomb telephone 
communications network in 21 cities of the Ukraine within seven 
years. 
  %INFOKOM, a Ukrainian-German enterprise, founded by the 
``Kievsvyaz'' Production Association and an informational 
computer center together with Controlwere, a German firm. The 
joint enterprise should have already created ``UKRPAK,'' a 
national packet switching center, in 1993. 

    Since the newly created joint enterprises, as well as 
the highly profitable ones, will provide a significant portion 
of low paying services (the majority for the national currency), 
and since one of the main sources of currency receipts necessary 
for developing and repaying the currency investments of Western 
partners is international communications services, these joint 
enterprises have received the exclusive right to provide such 
services. 
  This right is also provided to them because free 
competition does not always justify itself when communications 
services are thinly spread, and it can cause higher quality 
services to be provided in the economically developed regions 
and fully satisfy demand, while low-paying services may not be 
provided at all in regions with a poorly developed economy, 
which can destroy the harmonious development of the whole 
infrastructure of the state. 
  The newly created joint enterprises have already begun 
to implement specific projects. On 17 November an international 
telephone station system in the city of Kiev went operational. 
On 17 February 1993 a new automatic international telephone 
station came on line in Lvov. In 1992 the first 20 subscribers 
began to operate on a packet switching network. 
  By using joint ventures and by taking advantage of 
bartering, the investment of approximately 100 million U.S. 
dollars in the development of communications in the Ukraine is 
planned in 1993. Automatic international telephone stations will 
be modernized in six regions, and a telephone communications 
network will be brought on line in Kiev. All the areas and 
regions will receive access to the packet switching network. 
  Despite the economic decline which continued in 1992 in 
the Ukraine, the communications industry had 30% more 
revenues 
than in 1991. The decline in the rate of development of 
international telephone stations was stopped. 
  Of course, everything cannot be resolved so simply. 
There are many problems. Sometimes partners do not understand 
each other. However, if the desire is great on both sides, any 
problems which occur can be resolved. Unfortunately, some want 
to get a quick return and do not want to work toward the future. 
  We need to modernize the primary network with 
fiber-optic communications cables, and we hope to carry out this 
work by obtaining credits. It is clear that credits can be 
obtained if the investors are completely convinced of a return 
on their investment. Therefore, we are working on improving the 
structure and changing the tariff policy. We are learning to 
earn money. Values are being reassessed. This reassessment is 
not always understood by our people, who are used to having 
social guarantees. However, there is no other way. 
  Ukrainian legislation is creating favorable conditions 
for foreign investment. In accordance with the law ``On Foreign 
Investments,'' these investments are not subject to 
nationalization. Reimbursement of losses is provided for, if 
governmental organizations act improperly, and the transfer of 
revenues and profits after payment of taxes and mandatory duties 
is guaranteed. The law gives enterprises with foreign 
investments the right to determine prices for their products. 
The joint enterprises are not taxed for five years, and then a 
tax is established at 50% less than the existing tax. A 
portion 
of the profits which are reinvested in the Ukraine will not be 
taxed. 
  The creation of joint enterprises and the integration of 
elements of market relations have revealed inadequacies in the 
industry's management structure, and at the present time it is 
being reorganized. The Communications Ministry will not fulfill 
the function of operating company any longer, nor interfere in 
the economic and financial activities of the enterprises, but 
will determine and be responsible for the political and 
strategic aspects of development, and will accept responsibility 
for regulating and creating conditions for competition in the 
industry. 
  Work is being carried out to create a major association 
on the republic level. This association will be involved in a 
unified process in telecommunications and will eventually turn 
into a holding company. 
  Foreign investment, advanced technologies and the 
operating experience of Western partners under market conditions 
will shortly permit a qualitative breakthrough in the 
telecommunications field in the Ukraine. These will also permit 
the integration of telecommunications into the world-wide 
network, which will create good conditions for establishing 
market organizations in the economy and for widely attracting 
foreign investments to develop the economy in other industries 
as well. In the final analysis, this will accelerate the process 
of bringing the Ukraine closer to the advanced countries in the 
telecommunications field.

  [Text]In Russia, the current level of telecommunications 
development corresponds overall to the state of the Russian 
economy. Quantitative indicators for the industry rise steadily, 
although the rate of their growth has somewhat slowed down 
recently. 
  However, there is no cause for complacency. The industry 
does 
not permit market structures to function with certitude. Quality 
is not high, and the volume of the industry's main services is 
limited. The most modern types of these services are poorly 
developed. 
  New requirements for communications services and the gradual 
formulation of a market economy made it necessary to develop a 
new state policy in the industry. 
  Recently, the Russian government adopted ``A Concept for a 
Russian Federation Program in the Communications Field.'' This 
concept determines strategic approaches for the industry to move 
ahead in the forthcoming period, including stages and ways to 
move ahead. 
  On the basis of this document, specific programs for 
individual types of telecommunications are being developed, 
including regional programs and programs for specific 
sub-branches of the industry. These programs provide for: 


    -  Prioritizing the development of the communications 
industry and establishing an incentive-based state policy in 
this area; 
  -  Optimally combining state investments in the industry with 
the combined resources of enterprises, as well as drawing on 
private domestic and foreign capital; 
  -  Using all forms of private property in the industry, and 
eliminating monopolies which provide communications services; 
  -  Creating the legal means for developing communications in 
the country, as well as legal guarantees drawing domestic and 
foreign enterprises into investments; 
  -  Converting the communications field, including the 
conversion of the radio frequency spectrum; 
  -  Establishing a new tariff policy for communications services; 
  -  Licensing by the state for the activities of individuals and 
organizations in the field of communications and certifying 
communications equipment and services; 
  -  Creating new types of communications services; 
  -  Integrating domestic communications networks with foreign 
ones; 
  -  Gradually eliminating disproportions in the development of 
communications region-by-region, by taking into account the 
state of their economies; 
  -  Restructuring the industry. 

    In order to implement the ``Concept for a Russian Federation 
Program in the Communications Field,'' a regulated 
telecommunications market must be created. 
  The regulating role of the state involves concentrating 
efforts on key trends for developing the industry, creating 
conditions for satisfying the needs for communications services, 
conducting a coordinated technical policy, coordinating 
communications networks, and creating a civilized community of 
communications operating companies in the country. 
  The incentive-based state policy for developing 
communications calls for a preferential taxation and credit 
system. These preferential terms should be implemented when 
dividing land parcels for enterprises and communications 
facilities, when renting spaces, when local authorities allot 
subsidies, and when reducing taxes being charged to 
communication industries. The funds which are received should be 
used to invest in the communications industry. 
  The investment policy should be designed to attract foreign 
capital from all over the world, and this policy should 
primarily be implemented on the basis of the individual and 
combined resources of enterprises, associations, banking and 
other organizations, and individuals. Appropriations from the 
state budget are intended for use to implement the largest state 
programs. 
  Creating the legal basis so that the industry can function 
calls for the adoption of legislative acts of the Supreme 
Soviet, decrees of the President, and mandates of the 
government. These will ensure conditions for the development of 
communications in the country and provide legal guarantees for 
the functioning of the industry, including the protection of 
subscriber's rights, property protection, licensing and 
certification. 
  All the interrelated communications networks of Russia are 
public networks, department networks, and private networks. They 
form the Interrelated Communications Network of Russia, and they 
are created and developed using the principles of organizational 
and technical unity and mutual redundancy. The Russian 
Communications Administration particularly focuses on regulating 
the technical and organizational aspects involved in 
interrelating the various communications networks. 
  Enterprises in the industry are created on the basis of the 
similarities and differences in forms of property under 
competition. Networks and communications equipment may be state 
property (federal property, the property of subjects of the 
federation, or municipal property), or it may be the property of 
individuals or organizations, including foreign ones. 
  In order to improve the management of the communications 
industry in the new economic conditions, the industry is being 
restructured. Three independent subgroups in the industry are 
being identified: telecommunications, television and radio, and 
postal. At telecommunications enterprises the stock auctioning 
process has already begun. The creation of non-state companies 
is also being supported, including those involving foreign 
capital. 
  The new tariff policy in the communications field is 
characterized by its liberalization, and as the economic 
situation in the country stabilizes and market forces are 
adopted in the industry, it will also be characterized by a 
gradual reduction in interference on the part of the state in 
setting tariffs for communications services. Elements of state 
regulating are intended to retain social access to the main 
communications services while economic restructuring takes place 
in Russia. 
  Destroying the monopoly on providing communications 
services calls for the provision of these services by several 
operating companies. A license issued by the Russian 
Communications Ministry gives the right to provide 
communications services, and this ministry controls the quality 
of the services. Some services call for a competition to issue 
the license, which also serves the interests of the consumer, 
and serves to create an effective telecommunications system in 
the country. 
  In order to ensure high quality in the services being 
provided, and to preserve the compatibility of the 
communications networks and equipment, existing and future 
networks should be guarded against the appearance of equipment 
which does not meet the standards established for Russia in 
these networks. Therefore, each type of equipment to be 
installed must have a certificate issued by the Russian 
Communications Ministry on the basis of the results of testing 
conducted in specially created certification centers. 
  New types of communications services which are being 
created by competition, primarily for fulfilling the needs of 
market economy organizations, include the following: 


    -  high quality digital communications networks; 
  %data transmission networks with packet switching; 
  %high quality facsimile systems based on digital networks 
and/or modern data transmission networks; 
  %systems for receiving information from data banks; 
  %message processing systems, which permit 
telecommunications text retrieval services to be united into one 
automated system for message traffic between subscribers; 
  %mobile communications systems for document and speech 
traffic. 

    Calculations show that solvent demand for similar 
communications services is fairly high. For example, the demand 
for digital telephone communications services is approximately 
3.0- 3.5 million telephone sets, and for telecoded 
communications services (data transmission, message processing, 
and high quality facsimile communications) it exceeds several 
thousand connection points. At the same time, the potential 
exists for quickly fulfilling this demand by creating commercial 
organizations. 
  An important aspect of the Russian state policy in the 
communications field is international cooperation, which should 
become one of the ways for this industry to get out of this 
difficult position under modern conditions. This cooperation is 
developing in the following areas: 


    -  Attracting foreign investments to carry out national 
and regional programs; 
  %Creating joint enterprises to introduce advanced 
technology and new equipment into Russian communications 
networks; 
  %Expanding existing international communications networks, 
and increasing the volume and quality of services provided to 
subscribers of the public networks in order to more fully 
integrate the national communications system with communications 
systems of the world community; 
  %Carrying out major technical projects with foreign firms; 
  %Purchasing imported equipment for the Russian 
communications network; %Initiating scientific and 
technical exchanges, and attracting foreign specialists to 
provide an expert's analysis of national programs and projects; 
  %Participating in the work of the International 
Telecommunications Union; 

    Adapting the communications industry to new economic 
conditions and new subscribers' demands will require a certain 
amount of time and can be carried out in stages. During stage 
one, the critical situations in the industry have to be stopped 
with extreme measures, since the crisis in the country's economy 
is continuing. This stage began in 1992 and also encompasses the 
current year of 1993. 
  The main measures to be carried out during stage one are 
the following: 


    -  Liberalizing the tariff policy in the industry in 
order to increase enterprises' revenues, primarily by providing 
new and higher quality services to commercial market 
organizations. During this stage, elements of state tariff 
regulation will be maintained for the population and 
organizations funded by the state; 
  %Improving the industry's management structure, which was 
already discussed, and privatizing enterprises; 
  %Carrying out projects which will be implemented in 
relatively short time periods and will receive moderate capital 
investments will allow a fast return to be obtained. By the same 
token, this will make it possible to obtain the means for 
developing subsectors of the telecommunications industry with 
low profits. Such projects primarily include the creation of an 
international communications system in Russia, and the 
development of systems which will allow new, highly profitable 
services to be provided (for example, honeycomb radiotelephone 
service or data transmission with packet switching); 
  %Introducing new mechanisms for payments between 
communications enterprises. This will ensure the proportional 
distribution of revenues received by the industry among the 
participants in the information transmission process. This will 
give all enterprises the chance to develop by using their own 
resources; 
  %Increasing the performance of existing communications 
equipment and networks. 

    The second stage calls for a set of measures for 
supporting the functioning of the industry at the level which 
has been achieved, for stabilizing the economic situation in the 
industry and for preparing it for accelerated development. In 
terms of time, this stage corresponds with the transitional 
period associated with overcoming the crises in the Russian 
economy (approximately 1994-1995). 
  During this stage, the structural changes previously begun 
in the industry will be completed, issues of improving standards 
will completely be resolved, conditions will be created to 
broadly attract domestic and foreign investments into the 
industry, the integration of modern communications equipment and 
the development of new types of services will continue, market 
mechanisms will be improved, and eliminating the monopoly in the 
industry will continue. 
  Stage three (probably in 1996-2010) calls for measures to 
accelerate development of the industry after the crisis is 
overcome, and the evolution in the country's economy progresses. 
This stage presupposes significant investment growth in 
communications, a qualitative jump in converting networks with 
modern technologies for the transmission and processing of 
information, and increased integration of the telecommunications 
networks of Russia into communications systems of the world 
community. 
  It will be possible to increase the capacity of the public 
telephone network to 63-78 million basic telephone sets, and 
raise telephone density to 40-50 units per 100 inhabitants. New 
country- wide networks will arise. They will provide modern 
services which will be available to a broad range of 
subscribers, as well as high quality and expensive services for 
a more narrow group of subscribers. A general national data 
transmission network will appear, as well as a Russian 
intelligent network, and a digital network with integration of 
services. This will permit the creation of a telecommunications 
organization that will fill the demands of developing market 
relations. 
  As far as prospects for foreign partners participating in 
developing communications in Russia is concerned, this is 
already being carried out in many areas. 
  Our relationship is developing with communications 
operating companies, investment firms and international banks, 
with whom we are implementing major projects, both international 
and national in scope. An example of such successful cooperation 
is the construction of Russia's first international underwater 
fiber-optic line from Russia to Denmark in a system with digital 
radio relay links and three international switching stations. 
  One of the first examples of cooperation with foreign 
operating companies inside the country in the field of public 
networks is the project to create a modern communications 
network in the Kaliningrad region. A branch of the France 
Telecom Company is taking part in the project. The joint 
enterprise organized by this firm and its Russian partners 
already has a license for the creation of a dedicated line, and 
a permit to build a network integrated with the general 
telephone network is now being processed. Foreign partners are 
participating heavily in the creation of modern data 
transmission networks in Russia. Many networks with packet 
switching which are successfully functioning and dynamically 
developing have a foreign operating company partner, for 
example, the SPRINT network, INFOTEL, POCHET, and others. 
  Another important trend in developing cooperation is for 
domestic factories, primarily those which have been converted, 
to organize joint enterprises with foreign firms which 
manufacture communications equipment. Among them are firms such 
as IZHTEL, which are expanding into the production of modern 
switching equipment, which is extremely necessary now in Russia. 
Moreover, since there are limited currency resources, we prefer 
this form of cooperation to direct acquisition of communications 
equipment overseas. 
  An important mechanism for the state to regulate the 
industry market is licensing. Licenses for the right to provide 
many of the most economically attractive services are being 
competed. In this way, there is a selection of the most fully 
developed proposals which are the most effective and convenient 
for subscribers, and which provide effective use of limited 
resources, like the radio- frequency spectrum, the resources of 
satellite communications systems and telephone numbering. 
  Consequently, licenses are issued on a competitive basis 
for communications networks which have independent access 
overseas, and for honeycomb communications networks with 
NMT-450N and GSM-900 federal standards. 
  The first such competition for the GSM-standard networks 
has already taken place for 12 areas, regions and republics in 
the Russian Federation. US West, our partner of long standing, 
has won this competition with its Russian partners in 8 regions. 
  In order to issue a license to organize regional honeycomb 
systems for which the 800 MHz range has been identified, support 
of the regional administrations is necessary. 
  The state is interested in developing networks which 
provide local and long-distance in-country telephone service. 
However, these networks require larger capital investments than 
small networks having international access, and they are less 
profitable. Therefore, in order to provide incentives to 
operating companies working within the country, more favorable 
conditions for connecting with the public networks have been 
established for them. 
  If private international communications networks must 
interact with the country-wide network at the international 
switching center level, then local and long-distance operating 
companies can be connected to local and long-distance public 
networks. 
  Russia is a colossal market in the communications area both 
for operating companies and for equipment manufacturers, and 
Russia is trying to enter the global telecommunications society 
as a worthy member, having not only the most extensive 
communications network, but striving to build this network on a 
modern technical level. 
  We invite all our partners from the countries taking the 
place of the former Soviet Union and from neighboring countries 
to cooperate with us as equal partners in a mutually profitable 
manner.

  [Text]The conversion of defense enterprises to the 
manufacture of civilian products has already been occurring for 
several years. Nonetheless, the state conversion program has not 
yet been developed, and discussions on ways to implement it 
continue. While ways to solve the problem are being discussed, 
conversion continues. Many major, well-known defense enterprises 
which are part of the Aviation Industry Department, Radio 
Industry Department and Communications Industry Department of 
the Russian Industry Ministry (now the Russian Federation State 
Committee on Defense Industries), are beginning to fill civilian 
orders. Their activities in the telecommunications field can be 
attested to by the exhibits shown at the end of last year in 
Moscow at the ``Conversion-92'' International Fair Showroom, the 
``Science, Business, and Industry to Agriculture'' displays, and 
the ``Communications-93'' International Exposition organized in 
May of this year. Materials from these exhibitions were used to 
prepare the article published below. 
  In the Russian Federation, where 69% of enterprises 
and 
organizations of the former U.S.S.R.'s military industrial 
complex are concentrated, conversion encompasses a wide circle 
of industrial enterprises, research institutes, and 
construction, operating and other organizations. In order to use 
their potential in the interests of developing a civilian 
communications network, the following main conversion trends 
have been provided for: 


    -  redirecting the industrial, scientific and technical 
potential to produce and develop communications equipment for 
civilian purposes; 
  %using military communications equipment that has already 
been created and is already in production by making the 
necessary modifications for the economy; 
  %using scientific and technical achievements obtained 
during the development of military devices in order to create 
modern civilian communications equipment. 

    The main trend in the work to convert enterprises from 
military to civilian production is the creation of 
telecommunications systems and equipment within the framework of 
the Russian Federal Target-Oriented Program for Developing 
Communications Equipment and Information Systems in 1992-1995. 
The components of these programs (conversion programs for 
individual enterprises and scientific research institutes) have 
undergone an expert's analysis in the Communications Industry 
Department and Ministry of the Economy of the Russian 
Federation, the Ministry of Finance and Russian Central Bank. 
  Military communications equipment is being more widely used 
in the civilian industries of the economy. Though operators on 
geologic expeditions, on gas and oil pipelines, in energy 
networks and so on previously thought it was an impossible dream 
to acquire this military equipment, now many former limitations 
have been removed. 
  A significant percentage of special radio communications 
and radio relay communications equipment commercially-produced 
by enterprises of the military industrial complex can be used 
without any kind of significant modifications or modernization 
in various spheres of the economy, especially in the 
agro-industrial complex, where advantages of military equipment 
such as operation in broad temperature ranges, dust and moisture 
resistance and anti-shock qualities of the equipment, 
independent electrical powering, easy maintenance, etc., may be 
required to the greatest degree. 
  These types of devices are small ones (hand-held and 
driven) for dispatcher communications, stationary radio 
communications devices, radio relay and tropospheric 
communication devices for arranging interregional, regional and 
technical communications. In total, specialists of the 
``Telecom'' joint-stock company have calculated that about 40 
types of communications devices can be supplied to consumers in 
the economy without any type of alterations. 
  Some types of these devices are made by the Popov Factory 
AN Production Association (Nizhni Novgorod). Among them are 
R-980 ``Canoe'' mobile control centers, R-849M1 mobile 
communications radio unit, and the R-986 communications unit. 
  Among the purely civilian communications equipment, the 
``Iset'' digital radio relay system must be mentioned. It was 
developed by the ``Vektor'' State Enterprise (Yekaterinburg) and 
operates in the 15 GHz range of telephone channels (with a 
digital information transmission speed of 8.448 Mbit/sec) 
between urban and rural automatic telephone stations and 
telephone stations of individual industrial and commercial 
facilities. The digital information transmission distance is no 
less than 30 kilometers for one transit of the radio line. The 
stationary equipment of the ``Iset'' radio relay station 
connects with standard devices of IKM-120, IKM-30 and IKM-15 
digital transmission systems, which markedly simplifies its 
usage in local communications networks. 
  The ``Polet'' Scientific Research Institute (Nizhni 
Novgorod) is one of the largest producers of aviation radio 
communications equipment in the country. It is offering portable 
radio stations, automobile data transmission terminals, etc., to 
the economy. 
  The ``Moscow Scientific Research Television Institute'' 
Joint- Stock Company creates low-power television retranslators 
and transmitters, cable television systems, television 
monitoring receivers, and a specialized computer for colored 
television studios. 
  The low-power television retranslator is designed to 
provide television broadcasting to small towns blocked by the 
local relief from the direct signal of a powerful television 
transmitter. 
  A small-power television transmitter generates and radiates 
standard high frequency television display and sound signals on 
any given channel in meter and decimeter wave ranges. It can 
also be used to provide television broadcasting to small towns 
located along radio relay line routes, to create local 
broadcasting television centers in small towns, collective 
farms, and state farms, and to organize training television 
centers, etc. 
  The commercial system of cable television is designed to 
distribute television programs to subscribers along fiber-optic 
communications lines via subscriber switches located remotely 
from the program distribution point. This allows the 
transmission of one of eight television programs with sound to 
the subscribers' receivers at their selection. The number of 
subscriber switches is not limited in this system. 
  Backward channel equipment for cable television systems 
permits data to be exchanged between the head station and 
distribution network devices, as well as subscriber devices, in 
order to broaden the number of services provided to the 
subscriber, and in order to make it possible to supervise the 
status of the distribution network and the line, distribution 
and house amplifiers, as well as other engineering facilities 
located in homes serviced by that cable television system. 
  By using this promising equipment, subscribers can obtain 
additional services, such as fire and intrusion detection for 
rooms, medical assistance, and pay-per-view for commercial 
television programs. 
  The KTV-1 specialized computer is designed for colored 
television studios, mobile television stations, training 
television centers and video libraries. It generates a TV signal 
of text and graphic information simultaneously with the control 
room signal and allows work to be carried out in the mixing, 
special effects and rear projection modes. The KTV-1 can use a 
variety of text and graphic editors and programming languages. 
The use of this device allows the technical and creative 
potential of television studios to be broadened. 
  The ``ASTRA'' Scientific Production Association has 
developed a stationary transmitter-receiver control room called 
``Liliya-S,'' which is designed to be placed at terminals of 
reporting radio relay junction lines of the ``Liliya'' and 
``Liliya-1'' type, and to service television channels and the 
sound accompaniment channels of reporting radio relay lines. It 
is possible to place from one to six reporting radio relay line 
terminal units in the control room. Depending upon how it is 
equipped, the stationary transmitter- receiver control room 
services from one to three duplex communications channels. The 
control room corrects, controls and switches video signals and 
sound accompaniment signals, remotely controls the antennas, 
loud speaker and telephone communications, and dispatcher radio 
communications. 
  The ``Vektor'' state enterprise manufacturers TMS-1517 and 
TMS- 1517V international and long-distance pay phones. Payment 
for conversations is made with coins, tokens, or by credit card. 
There is precise control of the tokens, money and credit cards; 
slugs are weeded out; the deposited tokens are counted; the 
number being dialed and the connection time remaining after the 
next coin or token has been collected are optically displayed; 
the sum remaining can be used to pay for making a connection 
with another subscriber with the appropriate recalculation of 
the tariff; conversations are automatically tariffed; and pay 
phones are monitored from the automatic control panel. 
  The Lavochkin Scientific Production Association, the 
Academician A. A. Raspletin Scientific Production Association of 
the Russian Federation, the ``Radio'' Scientific Production 
Association, MRTZ (Moscow) and a number of other organizations 
are developing the ``Nord'' commercial satellite communications 
system. This system is designed for the northern regions of 
Russia, in particular the Tyumen region. The system will include 
a full set of space and ground equipment created under a unified 
project. This will allow qualitatively new services to be 
provided to stationary (fixed) and mobile subscribers, and will 
ensure the system functions no matter what state the traditional 
domestic communications equipment is in. It will be possible for 
users to have direct access to the satellite via their 
individual stations, which will make two-way subscriber 
communications possible almost throughout all of Russia and the 
foreign countries, bypassing the existing communications 
network. Individual fixed communications stations can be 
interfaced with the local telephone network. An operating mode 
and signals which correspond to international standards have 
been provided for. The stations will provide telephone, telefax 
and telex communications, and intercomputer data exchange 
according to international protocol. Portable stations with 
1.5-2 meter antennas will be developed. The frequency range is 
11-14 GHz. 
  Satellites of the ``Nord'' system will be launched from the 
territory of Russia into a high elliptical orbit with a 12 hour 
orbital period. The highest point of the orbit (40,000 
kilometers) is located in the northern hemisphere at 63 degrees 
latitude. Within a 24 hour period, the satellite will rise above 
the northern hemisphere two times. The length of the 
communications session last 6.5 hours on each loop. Thus, one 
satellite provides communicates for practically all regions of 
the northern hemisphere in a 24 hour period, as well as a 
portion of the southern hemisphere for two time intervals 
lasting 6.5 hours each. The total time is 13 hours. If two 
satellites are functioning, 24 hour communications is provided. 
  `` Nord'' plans to use three or four satellites in the 
system for redundancy. The use of satellites in elliptical 
orbits for timely communications in the northern hemisphere is 
advisable for several reasons. First, all northern hemisphere 
countries which are inaccessible to traditional communications 
satellites located in geostationary orbits fall within the line 
of sight of each satellite. Second, effective communications at 
high latitudes are possible. Third, launching a satellite into 
an elliptic orbit requires significantly less expenditures and 
can be carried out in a compressed time schedule (the advantages 
in launch time and cost of the carrier rocket are a factor of 
five to six), and the cost of providing the services can be two 
or more times less that the existing level of both world and 
internal Russian prices. This year there are plans to assemble 
and perform surface testing of two satellites. 
  The Makeyev Design Bureau (Miass) is developing a personal 
satellite communications system. In order to implement this 
system, the ``URALKOSMOS'' Joint Stock Company has been formed. 
It has been directed to attract support for the project from 
commercial structures. 
  The personal satellite communications system is similar to 
the ``Iridium'' system of the American Motorola Firm. Since it 
has its own carrier rockets which can launch satellites into low 
orbits (approximately 700 km), the specialists of the design 
bureau have decided to independently develop a domestic system. 
V. Kalashnikov, the leading specialist of the marketing service 
of the Academician Makeyev ``Space-Rocket System'' Machine 
Building Design Bureau feels that, ``...there is no problem in 
connecting these two systems.'' 
  The cooperative of development engineers includes about 100 
enterprises and organizations. The number of communications 
satellites in the orbital group will be 32-48. The frequency 
range will be 1.5-1.6 GHz. The information transmission speed 
will be 32 kbit/second. 
  The creation of several types of terminal equipment has 
been proposed, from stationary systems, which include a 
computer, telex, printer, and fax, to simple portable stations 
weighing from one to two kilograms. The latter can be of wide 
use in expeditions, geological teams, for servicing gas and oil 
pipelines, electrical networks, in special services, etc. 
  The Radio Device Construction Scientific Research Institute 
(Moscow) is developing the ``Signal'' mobile satellite 
communications system. The ``Energiya'' Scientific Production 
Association and the ``Polet'' Production Association are among 
those carrying out the project. It is a commercial system based 
on low orbiting satellites. It contains a central amplifier 
station, a flight control center, a space segment composed of 48 
artificial earth satellites, a base station network consisting 
of 5 stations, and subscriber stations. The number of orbits is 
4, the inclination is 72 degrees, the elevation is 1,500 
kilometers, and the satellite's orbital period is 116 minutes. 
As a launcher, the ``Tsiklon'' carrier rocket will be used. A 
launch is planned in 1993, and deployment into the national 
system in 1995. Deployment into the global system is planned for 
1997-2000. 
  Based on the space communications devices launched into 
operational orbits by the ``Energiya'' carrier rocket, the 
``Globus'' space communications system is being developed. 
  Space devices for the system are being created on the basis 
of achievements made by the ``Energiya'' Scientific Production 
Association and on the basis of cooperation in the area of 
complex space systems, including the ``Energiya-Buran'' shuttle 
transport system and piloted orbital systems. 
  A spacecraft's potential to position heavy payloads with 
large power-to-weight ratios of unified space platforms allows 
retranslators to be furnished on one craft. These retranslators 
simultaneously carry out several functions (fixed and mobile 
communications, and direct television broadcasting). This 
potential also allows the productivity of the satellites to be 
sharply increased, and the number required in orbit to be 
sharply decreased. Moreover, it simplifies and reduces the cost 
of receivers. 
  The Moscow-based Radio Communications Scientific Research 
Institute is creating the ``Oreol'' on-board retranslator, the 
``Kanat-1S'' on-board antenna system, the ``Potok-P1'' and 
``Potok-P2'' small satellite communications stations, the 
``Format-P'' device, the ``Shtrikh-P'' channel receiver and a 
demonstration program for processing satellite information. 
These are being created for a domestic space system for 
observing the Earth's surface. This system is based on the 
``Planeta-S'' geostationary satellites and is similar to the 
Meteosat European system now being operated at the present time, 
the American GOES, the Japanese GMS and the Indian ``Insat.'' 
  The ``Potok-P2'' small satellite communications station 
(radio buoy) is designed to receive and transmit formalized 
messages from meteorological data collection platforms. The 
``Potok-P1'' station only receives messages. Both stations can 
operate on vehicles, on geological expeditions and in other 
areas. They meet the requirements of the international 
information collection system. 
  The on-board ``Oreal'' retranslator collects and transmits 
data from data collection platforms and from ice exploration 
aircraft on the hydrometeorological and heliogeophysical 
situation on the Earth's surface and in the world's oceans. It 
transmits televised information on cloud, ice and snow cover on 
the Earth. Its functions also include the transmission of data 
on the radiation and magnetic situation in near-Earth space, and 
the distribution of weather maps and other processed 
meteorological information to users. 
  With the launch of the domestic artificial Earth satellite 
for operating in the global operational meteorological satellite 
system, the country has obtained a large flow of meteorological 
and geophysical information for use in the economy. 
  The Avtomatiki Scientific Industrial Association 
(Yekaterinburg) has developed the IGLON inertial satellite 
system. The system is designed for navigation of spacecraft, 
aircraft, sea and lake craft, and automobiles, as well as for 
determining coordinates when resolving mapping, geodesic and 
geophysical tasks. 
  The system includes a small inertial gyrostabilized 
platform and a multichannel receiver for radio navigation 
signals of the GLONASS and NAVSTAR satellite systems. 
  Depending on consumer requirements, it is thought that 
various models of the IGLON device will be manufactured. Each 
has different characteristics and design. 
  Among the other interesting developments in communications, 
there are the ``MAG'' subscriber station (President's Federal 
Agency of Governmental Communications and Information of the 
Russian Federation), the packet communications controller 
(COMPAS-R., Ltd. packet communications company), the 
multifunctional antenna system (``Fayvish Sheyner and Co., 
Ltd.'' joint stock company in Nizhni Novgorod and the Pravdin 
Factory of Radio Relay Equipment), the ``STELA-64'' automatic 
electronic telephone station (SVT Scientific Production 
Association in the city of Kirov), the KST-300 telephone 
scrambler (coding device on a digital channel) and the KST-101 
device for closed communications (``KOMREK'' joint stock company 
in Moscow). 
  The ``KOSMOS'' Joint Stock Company (in Krasnoyarsk) has 
developed the ``Kosmos-S'' satellite communications system, 
which is designed to: (1) organize communications in 
inaccessible regions; (2) create organizations which make it 
possible for banks, stock exchanges, trade houses and other 
producers of goods and services to begin using the newest 
electronic operating technologies; (3) create commercial 
informational data bases on various fields for Russian and 
foreign users; and (4) to open international computer networks 
to Russian users. 
  The ``Kosmos-S'' satellite communications system is based 
on the usage of stationary artificial Earth satellites of the 
``Gorizont,'' ``Raduga,'' and ``Express'' type, and it consists 
of a network of ``Kosmos-SA'' ground subscriber stations which 
operate under the command of a ``Kosmos-STs'' ground central 
station. In 1993, 60 subscriber stations were deployed in 
Russian territory and neighboring countries. In future, their 
number will be increased to 1,000-1,500. 
  The DALS firm (St. Petersburg) is one of Russia's leading 
developers and manufacturers of telecommunications systems and 
equipment for various purposes. Using the potential that was 
released under conversion, this firm has created a number of new 
products. 
  The mobile radio fire and intrusion detection warning 
system developed by the firm is a wireless system for fire and 
intrusion detection for various industrial, cultural, and 
agricultural facilities. It is significant in that the devices 
can be deployed, dismantled and set up again in a new location 
quickly. It has various configurations, depending on the 
specific requirements for facility protection, and it operates 
without regard for the serviceability of the facility's main 
electrical power network. 
  There is one other product of the firm--the SA-1 hearing 
aid for individuals with weakened hearing. It is made in a 
small, over-the-ear case, and is held in place on the outer ear 
with a sound wire that ends with an ear insert. The device is 
equipped with a volume control, and a switch for conversation 
modes where the speaker is present or is speaking on the 
telephone, and a power switch. 
  The ``TEKOS, LTD.,'' Company (Moscow), which was created in 
1992 on the basis of the Central Machine Building Scientific 
Research Institute which studies space research, has developed a 
telecommunications and message processing system. The system 
uses effective, fairly inexpensive domestic technology which 
combines a personal computer with a packet switching network 
based on the MKKTT X.25 and X.32 recommendations. The system 
insures the confidentiality and safety of information being 
transmitted and processed by using special, certified software 
and hardware. At the present time, TEKOS is widely used in 
banking (clearing house) organizations for transmitting 
information. 
  The RAZAN Radio Factory offers the R-173-1SV radio station, 
which provides two-way telephone radio communications that do 
not require fine-tuning or searching between stationary 
stations, nor between mobile objects on any of the six 
pre-established frequencies. 
  The Nizhegorod ``Kvarts'' Scientific Research Instrument 
Building Institute has developed a BM-01 TMS pay phone which is 
designed for long-distance conversations between cities using a 
credit card distributed by the communications division. 
  The pay phone automatically establishes payment for a 
conversation based on zone and time, independently establishes 
tariffs for the automatically established connections and makes 
the appropriate annotation on the credit card. The degree to 
which the monetary assets of the credit card are used during the 
conversation is displayed on the digital indicator. 
  The pay phone is connected to the subscriber lines, which 
are equipped with a device for automatically determining the 
number. Access to the long distance telephone network is 
provided along the record operator's connecting lines. 
  The ``YARZ'' Joint Stock Company (in Yaroslavl) with the 
St. Petersburg subsidiary of the RADIO Scientific Production 
Association have created ``Kompleks-MG'' equipment for digital 
radio relay lines, which provides communications along a narrow 
radio beam in the 10.7-11.7 GHz range at a distance of 15-45 
kilometers. 
  The series 300 modern equipment system for distribution 
television networks and cable television has been developed 
here, in conjunction with the Minsk ``Gorizont'' Production 
Association. This system includes a head station, linear, main 
line and home amplifiers, and television modulators. 
  Thus, hundreds of enterprises of the defense complex are 
prepared to find peaceful uses for their resources, and they are 
ready to cooperate with the communications industry, with new 
commercial organizations and foreign business partners who need 
their potential.

  [Text]The telephone situation in the homeland is not in 
need of commentary. More than 60,000 towns that have a 
population of up to 50 inhabitants do not have telephone service. 
  The Russian Communications Ministry is attempting to find 
acceptable options to escape this communications deadlock. In 
the beginning of December in Yoshkar-Ola, Russian 
telecommunications workers met with specialists from the 
Agriculture Ministry to discuss telephone communications 
problems in the rural areas of Russia. 
  For the former Communications Ministry of the Soviet Union, 
state and collective farms were always the main focus of 
attention. The money that was sent was centralized in these 
locations, and it was primarily here that systems of internal 
industrial communications were created. To a certain degree, 
this helped to provide telephone service to other public 
facilities in the countryside, such as hospitals, clubs and the 
post office. Approximately 200,000 new telephone numbers were 
introduced each year. This number is small, but it has now 
dropped to 75,000- 80,000 overall. 
  The Soviet Union Communications Ministry was essentially a 
gigantic monopoly. The communications industry is one of the 
largest and most profitable throughout the world. Its yearly 
volume of products and services is 260 million dollars. Despite 
the fact that the Communications Ministry brought large revenues 
to the state, it was treated like a step-daughter. ``Now, 
so-called analogue communications equipment predominates here,'' 
Deputy Minister Aleksandr Krupnov attests. These obsolete 
systems require large industrial rooms and are not reliable or 
cost-effective. Only 2% of Russian communications 
equipment 
meets world standards to one degree or another. 
  The Russian Communications Ministry now feels that its main 
function should not be financing, but regulating relations 
between all organizations involved in this field. The main 
missions involve issuing certificates and licenses to those 
commercial organizations which want to work in the 
communications business. ``Today, about 700 enterprises have 
already received an operating license,'' Aleksandr Krupnov 
notes. For now they do not have a very large percentage of the 
work. Special hopes are placed on foreign capital in the 
communications industry. It is thought that foreign firms, and 
far from minor ones at that, will be expressing significant 
interest in Russia. 
  Adding to what the deputy minister said, the development of 
communications equipment was heavily dependent on foreign 
deliveries, as it turned out in the former U.S.S.R. For example, 
we received more than 65% of automatic telephone stations 
and 
30% of cable from overseas. Among foreign partners, there 
were 
many enterprises from the Comecon countries. Today, preference 
is given to such leaders as Alcatel, Bell, and Siemens, if the 
latter propose profitable contracts, of course. 
  The second strategic line of the Russian Communications 
Ministry is to have the local municipal administrations agree to 
all tariffs for communications services. The cost of the 
services should reimburse operating expenses for the 
communications systems, pay for credits, and ensure funds 
accumulate for developing communications networks. This means 
that no funds will be used from the federal budget for these 
purposes. On the surface, this approach seems rational, but in 
practice it is difficult to implement. 
  In the middle of 1993, the Moscow City Telephone Network 
established fairly unusual tariffs. For state organizations 80 
rubles for each line per month was established. For a private 
telephone, a little more than 100 rubles was charged, and for 
all others 1,500 rubles. It is not the numbers themselves that 
are important here since they change constantly, but their 
ratios. According to Mr. Krupnov, there is a certain logic at 
play here. For state locations, the lowest prices are 
established because there is no point in pumping money in the 
budget from one pocket to another. Those who have telephones in 
their homes should receive social protection, and commercial 
organizations should pay ``whole hog,'' and even more than that, 
because any prices for them are still just a drop in the bucket. 
  At one time the Moscow City Telephone Network installed 
140,000-150,000 new home and other telephone numbers per year. 
Today that number is 40,000-50,000. Many districts of the 
capitol suffer from total ``telephone silence,'' to say nothing 
of the suburbs, where the population density is incidentally no 
less than that of Moscow itself. There is much talk about 
creating a system of fiber-optic communications rings along the 
capitol boulevards, the Garden Ring road, the circle road and 
even throughout the Golden Ring. This network will ostensibly 
provide for more widespread telephone service in the capitol and 
the region. 
  ``It is not worth becoming too carried away,'' Mr. Krupnov 
warns. ``Even though fiber-optic cables have enormous capacity 
compared to traditional cables, in and of themselves they cannot 
resolve the problem.'' Installing such lines will make it 
possible to forget about communications for the next 10-15 
years, but all the rest must also be available, in addition to 
the communications channels. For example, virtually all the 
telephone numbers in Moscow have been selected. Therefore, new 
automatic telephone stations must be constructed, and other 
necessary equipment purchased. Unfortunately, we are in no 
condition to do this ourselves. The technical level of even our 
major communications equipment manufacturers does not meet 
modern standards. The defense industries which are now 
converting to the manufacture of civilian products also do not 
instill hope. 
  Economic reasons remain the stumbling block. Of course, 
the Communications Ministry feels that it is possible to develop 
the most modern concept for providing telephone service for both 
highly populated and sparsely habitable regions of Russia. 
Foreign investors must be drawn in. In fact this is what is 
being done. However, without state support it is unlikely that 
communications will get on its feet.

  [Abstract] Bending of reinforcing cables is found to have a 
substantial effect on the stressing of the jacket in the driving 
zone, and this must be considered in the design of this zone. 
Particular attention must be focused on sections where 
stretching stresses caused by bending are not compensated. 
Analysis of the stressing of the driving zone must also consider 
the effect of all bent reinforcement elements using programs 
that consider their actual trajectories and friction. Figures 3.

  [Abstract] This article describes the measures which need 
to be taken to improve upon the design of atomic energy plants. 
Key steps which must be taken are modernization of existing 
active safety systems, supplementation of traditional active 
systems with passive systems, and institution of internal 
self-protection and safety measures. Data shows that the AES-92 
design has distinct advantages over the AES U-87 and AES-91 
designs. Tables compare the specifications of these designs. In 
addition to improved safety features, this AES-92 design is more 
compact and uses less construction materials. The active and 
passive protection systems used in the AES-92 are described. 
Radiation safety is discussed. Figure 1; tables 3; references 2

<F P=106> [Article by Vlad Ignatov and Vera Romanova: ``Russia's </F>
Nuclear Facilities Inventoried: Absolutely No Order''] 
  [Text] In the middle of last year, several days after the 
accident in Tomsk-7, Russia's president issued directive No. 224 
instructing the bodies of the Russian Federation's Oversight of 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety to examine all nuclear facilities 
and facilities posing a radiation threat to verify that safety 
and physical shielding measures are being taken at them. By the 
end of 1993, more than 200 nuclear enterprises and enterprises 
posing a radiation threat that belong to such departments as the 
Ministry of Atomic Energy, Russian Federation Committee on the 
Defense Industry, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of 
Transportation, and Kurchatovskiy Institute Russian Scientific 
Center were examined. The Federal Oversight of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety focused its attention on nuclear power plants. 
  The results of the examination confirm that Russia's nuclear 
power plants are incapable of maintaining their equipment in a 
safe state or modernizing it. Twenty-nine units at nine nuclear 
power plants with a total statutory capacity of 21,242 MW are 
now operating in Russia. This includes 13 units with pressurized 
water reactors, 15 units with uranium-graphite channel-type 
reactors, and 1 unit with a fast neutron reactor. Nearly all 
currently operational power plant units were started up between 
1971 and 1990. The only ``latecomer'' among them is the No. 4 
unit at the Balakovo Nuclear Power Plant, which was put into 
operation in 1993. 
  From a nuclear and radiation safeguarding standpoint, 
nuclear 
power plant units may be divided into two generations. The 
first-generation units were developed and constructed before the 
main domestic normative documents regulating safety in atomic 
energy came to light. Included among them are the Nos. 3 and 4 
units of the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant; the first two 
units at the Kola, Kursk, and Leningrad nuclear power plants; 
and the No. 4 unit at the nuclear power plant in Bilibino. In 
the opinion of experts of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety, they all require radical reconstruction 
because their obsolete and physically worn-out equipment and 
system components are in the habit of failing very frequently. 
When the second-generation units were developed, consideration 
was already given to the tolerances that had been introduced at 
the time. Today, however, the safety rules, and consequently the 
power plant units themselves, no longer conform to standards. 
  The Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety has 
not 
recently recorded any accidents related to the meltdown of a 
reactor core or the release of any significant quantities of 
radioactive materials into the environment. Nor has it recorded 
any serious fires with the exception of a number of 
insignificant deflagrations and instances of blanketing with 
smoke. Incidents involving the operating failure of relief 
valves and, consequently, nondesign reactor unit shutdown 
cooling have had the biggest impact on the decrease in the 
safety of nuclear power plants. The most acute worsening of 
operating indicators was detected at the Kola Nuclear Power 
Plant. In the opinion of Federal Oversight of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety observers, it is related to a careless attitude 
toward operating rules and equipment repair. Moreover, a check 
of the qualifications of about 5,000 technicians at nuclear 
facilities and facilities posing a radiation threat revealed 
that nearly 500 of them do not have sufficient knowledge of 
safety standards and rules. An analysis of violations at nuclear 
power plants indicates that a significant number, i.e., nearly 
40 percent of all violations, have been due to shortcomings in 
the work of maintenance personnel. 
  The state of radwaste removal has also become 
unsatisfactory. 
An increase in the amount of nuclear fuel stored on site at 
nuclear power plants and the complete absence of even any desire 
to remove it at power plants with RBMK, EGP, and MBM reactors 
have been observed. Another problem arising because of the 
accumulation of waste at nuclear power plants is that there are 
no free spaces for emergency dumping of the reactor's entire 
core. The currently existing system of handling radwaste was 
developed in the 1960s. For this reason not one Russian nuclear 
power plant has a complete set of units to prepare liquid and 
solid waste for burial. 
  At the initiative of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety, the chairmen of its regional bodies took part 
in an interdepartmental commission to check the nuclear and 
radiation safety of the nuclear power facilities and equipment 
of the Russian Federation Navy's northern fleet. Judging by the 
results of the checks, the state of the overwhelming majority of 
the northern fleet's facilities and equipment is catastrophic. 
Personnel often operate the nuclear power plants of warships by 
the ``poke method,'' with the most flagrant violations of safety 
rules, and measures to bring them to the required level are left 
virtually untaken. It is therefore entirely natural that in the 
past year, seven navy men were hospitalized with a diagnosis of 
``over-irradiation.'' Another problem that has evoked serious 
concern on the part of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety is the navy's handling of radwaste. Tanks to 
store it temporarily are overflowing, and the navy's admiralty 
is not taking any measures to clean things up. Meanwhile, navy 
men continue to insist that they do not need outside help.

9,1992; UDC 621.039.577 182.3.003] 
  [Abstract] The urgency of developing projects of low 
capacity AESs for remote regions is stressed. But first one must 
solve a number of specific problems, such as reducing the cost 
of power produced at these AESs and providing skilled personnel 
for operating small AESs in remote regions. The first goal can 
be achieved by simplifying the design (making it modular), 
building the modules in a manufacturing plant and assembling 
them on the AES site. To achieve the second goal the design must 
permit prolonged AES operation in an automatic mode remotely 
controlled from a center that serves several such AESs. The 
article describes technical requirements to and schematic and 
design solutions of elements of low-power AESs developed at the 
OKBM. AESs built using these principles will meet requirements 
of self-sufficiency and there will be no need for permanent 
on-site presence of the operating personnel. Based on presented 
information it is contended that low-power AESs can have 
substantial technical and economic advantages over power sources 
that use organic fuels. Figures 3, references 2.

  [Abstract] Immediately after the Chernobyl AES accident a 
large number of design and analytical studies of the development 
of the accident and the role of various factors in that 
situation were performed at NIKIET and other research centers, 
including foreign ones. This has made it possible to perform 
numerical studies of the origin and development of the Chernobyl 
AES accident. The article presents initial results of such 
analysis using the Relap 5/mod 2 program; the standard version 
of this program is widely used abroad in studies of NEPUs 
[nuclear electric power units] safety. The article examines two 
problems: 1) studying the effect on the system of operation of 
emergency protection equipment A3-5 and short-term insertion of 
positive reactivity into the core when moving emergency 
protection rods during a pre-accident condition of the reactor, 
and 2) studying the consequences of turning off the 
turbogenerator and of run-out operation of two of the four 
operating main circulation pumps [MCPs] in each loop. 
Calculations performed for a reactor condition that was close to 
the condition of the 4th unit reactor of the Chernobyl AES 
immediately before the accident demonstrated in the first 
approximation that operation of the emergency protection system 
in and of itself does not cause reactor runaway. On the other 
hand, operation of two of the four MCPs in each half of a 
running out turbogenerator can result in the development of a 
catastrophic process even without the effect of positive 
reactivity of old style displacing rods. Figures 5, tables 3,

  [Abstract] Nowadays great attention is paid to analysis of 
possible AES accidents caused by overheating of fuel that 
results in global destruction and meltdown of the core and 
release of fission products into the heat transfer agent and 
beyond the primary loop and AES protective shell. To provide 
reliable computer forecasts of accident development it is 
necessary to know information on release of long-lived fission 
products and use an adequate mathematical and physical model of 
fission products release under conditions that are typical for 
serious accidents. Experimental studies of release of fission 
products in various media under different temperatures (up to 
the uranium dioxide melting point) have been conducted for 
several years at RNTs ``Kurchatovskiy institut''. The article 
presents results of measurements of time and temperature 
dependences of release of fission products such as [.sup]140[/] 
Ba, [.sup]140[/]La, [.sup]95[/]Zr, [.sup]103[/] 
Ru and [.sup]141[/]Ce when annealing 
irradiated specimens in an inert medium under conditions that 
simulate accident situations caused by overheating of reactor 
fuel. Results of test conducted in an active medium are being 
prepared for publication. The article describes the specimens 
and procedure used for determining release of solid fission

  [Abstract] Specialized enterprises that handle radioactive 
waste perform centralized collection, transportation, processing 
and burial of low and medium radioactive waste in various Russia 
and CIS regions. Their activity brings up questions of the 
possible effect on environment, personnel and population of 
adjacent territories. Radioecological inspections of 19 
specialized enterprises were conducted in 1989-1993. The article 
presents a block diagram of operation of these enterprises, 
which actually shows a model of possible transfer of radioactive 
substances from an enterprise into environment. To obtain 
information on the radioecological status of the environment one 
studied _g_ radiation fields in various zones of each 
enterprise 
and the content of _a_ and _b_ emitting products and 
individual 
radionuclides in water, soil and vegetation. Results of the 
analysis for all specialized enterprises demonstrated that there 
was no noticeable effect on environmental objects. However, it 
is possible that this conclusion was the result of insufficient 
sensitivity of observation equipment, the small size of the 
statistical sampling and non-representative character of the 
samples. No correlation was found when a criterion based on the 
principle of independence of data related to different 
enterprises located far away from each other was used when the 
effect of radiation background was discounted. Within the error 
of measurement no environmental effect of the enterprises was 
found when using available procedures. However, one cannot 
consider this analysis as unbiased if one does not take into 
account radiation background data. Figures 2.

(Rovno AES); received May 31,1993; UDC 621.184.25:621.181.192] 
  [Abstract] Fourteen AES power units with VVER-1000 
reactors are currently operated in CIS countries. Each reactor 
has four steam generators, and 35 of those have already failed, 
after being in operation for less than one-quarter of their 
service life. While steam generators abroad fail due to 
corrosion damage of heat-exchange tubes, failures at AESs with 
VVER-1000 are caused by cracks in output (``cold'') collectors. 
The work described in the article was aimed at finding causes of 
the cracks. Cartograms of damage at 23 steam generators that had 
been replaced at the Novovoronezh, Balakovo, Yuzhno Ukrayinskaya 
and Zaporozhye AESs were studied (there was no damage at the 
remaining AES. It was found that there was a certain regularity 
of crack location and pattern. It is concluded that the location 
of damages is determined by design features of the tube plate, 
on the one hand, and peculiarities of thermal and hydraulic 
processes in the steam generator, on the other. The damage is of 
fatigue type. Substantial thermal cyclicity, which affects the 
collector metal temperature, is caused by frequent PVD 
[expansion not given] shutoff. Figures 3, references 7: 5

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Skilled Workers Are Important to Economic </F>
Construction''] 
[Text] The first ever China Youth Talent Olympics, jointly 
sponsored by nine units including the Ministry of Labor, the 
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the central committee 
of the Communist Youth League, came to a close after nearly 
three months of competition, with the outstanding achievements 
of skilled contestants in ten areas of industry providing a 
successful close to the competition. In June of this year, Jiang 
Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and other leading comrades each made 
speeches in dedication at the opening ceremonies. Yesterday, the 
contest organizing committee distributed prizes to the winners 
in a solemn ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Premier 
Li Peng and other leading comrades met with the winning 
contestants at Zhongnanhai. Throughout the course of the 
competition, leaders from every province, city, autonomous 
region, and industry showed heartfelt concern and support for 
the talented stars of labor. All of this amply demonstrates that 
our party and nation attaches a great deal of importance to our 
nation's working class, and in particular, to the vast number of 
young workers. The labor of our workers, and especially that of 
our skilled workers, is the key link in transforming science and 
technology into productive force, and is an important foundation 
of economic growth. Without the labor of workers who possess 
high quality and skill, high quality products would be 
impossible, as would a soaring economy. Science and technology 
is social wealth, and operational skill is also social wealth. 
In a certain sense, they are important sources of wealth at a 
deep level. We can introduce superb technology, advanced 
equipment, effective management techniques, and the applicable 
experts from abroad, but, is it possible to introduce from 
abroad the vast numbers of skilled workers required for economic 
construction? The superb operational skills of talented workers 
can create incalculable social wealth that money cannot buy. For 
this reason, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that, ``skilled 
workers are the sine qua non of economic construction.'' This is 
something we must fully recognize.p Jp People can still remember 
back to the 1950's and 1960's when our nation was producing 
large numbers of skillful craftsmen and ``masters of 
technology'' like Li Ruihuan, Ni Zhifu, Hao Jianxiu, and Wang 
Chonglun. The ``top notch work'', ``knack for getting the job 
done'', and ``work style'' that these individuals demonstrated 
on the production line greatly enhanced product quality and 
production efficiency. Their diligent technical study and the 
superb skills they attained were of monumental value in 
promoting construction enthusiasm in the working classes 
throughout the nation. Countless ``masters of technology'' not 
only created huge amounts of material wealth for our society, 
but they created precious spiritual wealth for society as well. 
The party, the nation, and society as a whole attached enormous 
importance to these workers. Today there are 120 million 
enterprise employees and nearly 100 million township enterprise 
employees in China, with 170 million of these people being 
workers who are the main force behind the creation of material 
wealth in society. As science and technology and the economy all 
grow at a rapid pace, the demand for higher cultural and 
technical quality of workers grows stronger. Yet, if we look at 
the current situation in the worker ranks in China, we see that 
this demand is far from being met. Looking at the make up of our 
worker ranks, we find only 200,000 technicians and 2,000-plus 
highly skilled technicians. If we look at the proportions of 
skill capacities required for production, we find that our 
technician ranks should grow to one million workers. Heightening 
the technical quality of our worker ranks is indeed an urgent 
mission required for development of our national economy. 
Vigorous national development demands that, while we attach 
importance to and give full play to the role of the 
intellectuals, we also must attach importance to and give full 
play to the role of the skilled workers, and this applies with 
particular force to highly skilled workers. We must stress 
growth in the worker ranks, we must adopt various forms, we must 
pursue various routes, and we must accelerate the cultivation of 
the various specialized technical workers. We must create a 
social atmosphere that attaches importance to technical 
operational skills and that respects technical workers. Of 
course, singers, movie stars, and dancers are needed in society. 
But, if ``these three stars are the only ones that shine'', 
while the multitude of skilled workers and technical stars who 
create immense wealth for society are busy with their noses to 
the grindstone, working in obscurity, and getting the cold 
shoulder, or being condemned or denounced, how is society going 
to grow? We should pay more attention to shining the media 
spotlight of skilled workers, we should focus the camera lens 
and direct the pen more toward capturing the accomplishments of 
the skilled workers and technical stars, and we should let the 
people know that, without the contributions of our technical 
stars and skilled workers, our society would be floundering in 
emptiness as it chases its ``stars.'' At the same time, we must 
call on leaders at every level to ardently show concern, to 
support, and to fully use and fully reward skilled workers and 
technical stars. This is an important measure that will prevent 
talent drain, safeguard the enthusiasm of skilled workers, and 
encourage skill growth and wealth creation on the job. Of 
course, further reform of an irrational labor wage system, 
destruction of the communal rice pot, and promotion of the 
social status of the skilled worker remain the fundamental ways 
to protect our skilled workers and induce young workers to study 
technical skills. p= pI hope that the ``technical stars'' and 
the ranks of the skilled workers in China expand into an 
enormous and powerful force. When large numbers of ``technical 
stars'' and skilled workers emerge, then the Chinese economy 
will enjoy sustained, rapid, and healthy growth. We look forward 
to this wonderful future!

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Kejun (3769 0344 6511):``China's Urban </F>
Unemployment Rate Rises Slightly''] 
[Text] China's third quarter employment growth remained 
sluggish, employment growth in urban collective units was even 
slower, employment growth among privately managed business and 
individuals was fairly rapid, and the urban unemployment rate 
rose slightly. Based on statistics, 147.37 million persons were 
employed at the end of September nationwide, 580,000 more than 
at the end of the second quarter, but 550,000 fewer than at the 
end of last year. Comparing previous year levels at the same 
period, there was a nearly 100,000 person fluctuation between 
the end last year and the end of September, such a degree of 
fluctuation not seen in the last ten years. Comparing ownership 
systems, we see that urban collective units lost quite a few 
workers, while the various joint venture units and foreign 
capital units continued to increase their employee ranks. 
Comparing industries, industry lost a considerable number of 
workers, while employment in the construction, health and 
fitness, and finance and insurance fields rose slightly. Looking 
at state-owned units, a fair number of permanent employees were 
cut, while contract employees grew in sizeable numbers. 
Statistics provided by the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce show that at the end of September private and 
individual employment in urban areas reached 11.5 million, an 
increase of 800,000 or 4.5 percent over the end of last year. 
Compared with last year's level at the same period, the increase 
was 500,000 employees or 5.4 percent. Looking at the different 
industries, employment growth was sizeable in the commercial and 
food service industries which accounted for about 70 percent of 
the total increase. Industry and construction employment, 
however, grew minimally, accounting for only about 30 percent of 
the total growth. Comparing regions, employment growth in the 
four provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Sichuan was 
significant, with each recording over 50,000 new employees, 
while employment growth in the three municipalities of Beijing, 
Shanghai, and Tianjin was minimal, with each having less than 
10,000 newly employed workers. According to Ministry of Labor 
statistics, at the end of September, the urban unemployment 
number stood at 3.78 million persons, or at a rate of 2.4 
percent. This is 0.1 percent higher than the level at the end of 
last year. It is estimated that the unemployment rate will rise 
to around 2.6 percent by the end of this year. Overall, the 
current urban unemployment situation is not growing 
significantly. Yet, in certain areas the unemployment rate 
continues to grow. This is especially true with respect to the 
aged, the young, border areas, and certain areas of the defense 
industry, mining, and the forestry industry where regional 
economic growth has been slow and workers have not departed in 
significant numbers. Generally, with respect to these areas, 
unemployment stands at over three percent, with some areas 
experiencing upwards of ten percent unemployment.

  [Abstract] The article examines construction principles of 
universal space platforms [USPs] using thermal emission nuclear 
electric power units [NEPUs] with thermal and fast reactors and 
electric reactive drives [ERDs] as applied to a ``Proton'' 
carrier rocket. Due to their compactness, the possibility to 
substantially increase the output during 15 to 20% of the 
total 
flight time, and small disturbances to spacecraft motion it is 
expedient to use thermal emission NEPUs in USPs. As far as their 
mass, overall dimensions, cost and performance characteristics 
are concerned, NEPUs have important advantages over 
photoelectric units. The article lists NEPU components and 
describes their parameters. Two versions of orbital injection 
are examined a single launch (the USP is launched into orbit 
together with the special purpose equipment module) and double 
launch (the USP and special) purpose equipment module are 
launched independently and then joined in a radiation safe 
orbit. Power supply of the special equipment module can also be 
done remotely by directional power transmission in the 
centimeter wave band. Capabilities of a spacecraft with USPs 
using various capacity thermal emission NEPUs for a flight to a 
stationary orbit, wherein a ``Proton'' rocket is used for 
launching into a low (about 200 km) orbit and a special purpose 
acceleration module is used for transferring the spacecraft to a 
radiation safe orbit (around 800 km), are discussed. The mass 
and dimensions of the special purpose equipment module are 
estimated. The data presented in the article justify the 
promising character of application of power propulsion complexes 
with thermal emission NEPUs for solving practical problems of 
space exploration. Tables 2, references 5.

  [Abstract] Industrial scale material production in space 
opens up the possibilities of manufacturing semiconductor and 
optical materials, composites and medical preparations with 
substantially better properties. At present the most promising 
is space manufacturing of semiconductor materials for the 
electronic industry. The article lists factors that give thermal 
emission nuclear electric power units [NEPUs] advantage over 
solar power units and make NEPUs promising for the above 
applications and discusses possible concepts for using NEPUS in 
industrial spacecraft operating in a radiation safe orbit. 
Peculiarities of automatic loading and unloading, as well as 
manual loading and unloading by cosmonauts are examined, and 
possible radiation doses the cosmonauts could be exposed to are 
estimated. Remote power supply of industrial spacecraft will 
eliminate the radiation risk for the cosmonauts, and at the same 
time completely eliminate the NEPU effect on residual overloads. 
The analysis showed that if certain practically realizable 
conditions are observed thermal emission NEPUs can provide the 
required power supply for industrial spacecraft. References 4.

  [Abstract] Because of high radiation sensitivity, high 
radio nuclide entrapment and slow self-cleansing capacity of 
trees, forest biogeocenoses are natural objects that are most 
vulnerable to exposure to ionizing radiation. The article 
examines possible radiation effects of releases of Novovoronezh 
AES on forest planting, because in the AES vicinity there are 
forests with various tree species, including coniferous species 
(at a distance of about 2 km from the AES). Estimates of the 
spectrum of probable AES effects on the forests can be 
considered typical for the majority of AESs in Russia and 
Ukraine, as well as in other countries. Dose loads on forest 
biogeocenoses located within a 30 km zone were calculated. The 
calculations took into account the forecast of changing 
radionuclide content in the near-ground atmospheric layer near 
the AES due to scheduled decommissioning of its 2nd, 3rd, 4th 
and 5th power units and several other engineering facilities and 
commissioning of the 6th and 7th power units. It was concluded 
that at present the Novovoronezh AES meets ecological safety 
requirements during normal operation. Effects of ionizing 
radiation from the maximum possible accident under the design 
conditions and the heaviest accident exceeding design conditions 
are analyzed. It is concluded that under certain AES accident 
scenarios radiation damage of adjacent forest planting is 
possible. This calls for conducting appropriate assessment 
during the design and construction of new AESs and for 
ecological control of operation of the existing AESs. Figures 4,

  [Abstract] Wide-scale work on manufacturing transplutonium 
elements and using them for manufacturing of radiation sources, 
as well as on using plutonium for manufacturing of experimental 
fuel elements and TVS [expansion not given] is being conducted 
at the NIIAR. The article presents results of studies conducted

procedure for and work conducted on determining the content of 
plutonium isotopes in samples of soil and river bottom deposits 
collected over the NIIAR territory and in the sanitary 
protection and observation zones. It lists basic requirements to 
analytical procedures for determining plutonium activity and 
shows a flow chart of the analysis used in the studies. The 
procedure validity was tested when analyzing IAEA samples Soil 
6; the analysis error did not exceed 10% at a 
0.95% confidence 
level. The samples were collected in the most representative 
points between June 19 and 26, 1989, and between June 11 and 15, 
1990. No noticeable effect of NIIAR activity on plutonium 
content in samples was detected. The studies showed that 
specific plutonium activity within 40 km of NIIAR was at the 
level of global activity for the Northern Hemisphere prior to 
the Chernobyl AES accident. Figures 1, tables 3, references 11:

  [Abstract] Work on ``Nontraditional Concepts of AES With 
Natural Safety'' is conducted within the framework of the State 
S&amp;T Program ``Ecologically Clean Power'' under the auspices 
of 
the Ministry of Science, Higher School and Technical Policy. 
Criteria of inherent safety of nuclear reactors (a new nuclear 
power philosophy proposed by a well known American scientist A. 
Weinberg) had been developed, and a contest of concepts of 
nuclear reactors meeting these requirements was conducted. It 
has been determined that of the five concepts presented for the 
contest the concept of fast reactors with a lead heat transfer 
agent (BREST [Russian abbreviation]) meets the requirements in 
the most thorough way. A group of IAE [Atomic Energy 
Institute] associates on the initiative and under the leadership 
of V.V. Orlov had begun the development of such reactor more 
than five years ago; the development then continued at NIKIET 
[expansion not given] and OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] 
``Gidropress'', with the participation of FEI, VNIINM, TsNIIKM 
``Prometey'', NIIAR, VNIITF [expansions not given], NPO 
[scientific production association] ``Luch'', MIFI [Moscow 
Engineering Physics Institute] and a number of other institutes. 
There are two directions of designing a reactor unit a three 
and a two loop scheme for removal of heat from the reactor core. 
The two loop scheme is deemed more promising. Conceptual designs 
of reactors BRS (300- 1000 MW of electric power) and BREST 300 
(300 MW) are described. As far as the cost of electric power is 
concerned, it is lower for BREST reactors than for reactors BN 
1600 and VTGR and comparable to reactors VVER. It is estimated 
that an experimental demonstration reactor can be built in 
approximately eight years, while construction of a pilot AES 
with this reactor will take 12 to 15 years. Three illustrations, 
two tables.

Kovalevich and Candidates of Technical Sciences A.M. Bukrinskiy 
and V.P. Slutsker (S&amp;T Center for Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety) 
under the ``Problems, Search, Solutions'' rubric] 
  [Abstract] The development of the nuclear power industry 
in the country can be conventionally split into three stages. 
During the first stage (first generation AES power units with 
reactors VVER-440 and RBMK 1000) normative regulation of safety 
was mainly based on the general industrial experience and 
experience in the development and operation of military nuclear 
units and research and experimental reactors. During the second 
period (second generation VVER 440 and RBMK 1000, and VVER 1000) 
problems of AES safety were dealt with more thoroughly, based on 
domestic and foreign experience in the development and operation 
of first generation AESs. At this stage construction of nuclear 
power units was governed by ``General Safety Requirements for 
the Design, Construction and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants'' 
(OPB-73), which on the whole corresponded to similar documents 
of other countries, for instance, to the then in effect U.S. 
``General Design Criteria for AES''. In 1982 the OPB 73 was 
revised and replaced with OPB 82, but the safety concept 
practically had not changed. Also during this stage normative 
technical documentation (NTD) dealing with radiation safety of 
the operating personnel and population at large was developed. 
In 1987 a ``Summary List and Plan for the Development of Rules 
and Standards Related to Nuclear Power'' (SPPNAE 87) was 
approved. It took into account the available experience in the 
development and operation of nuclear equipment, as well as the 
consequences of the Chernobyl AES (1986) and Three Mile Island 
(1979) accidents. This third (current) period of the development 
of nuclear power is characterized by more stringent requirements 
to ensuring AES safety. As of 1990, OPB 88 replaced OPB 82. The 
work on OPB 88 coincided in time with the development of ''Basic 
Principles of Ensuring Safety of Nuclear Power Plants'' 
(INSAG-3) by the International Consulting Group on Nuclear 
Safety under the auspices of the IAEA General Director, which 
made it possible to take into account the international 
experience in solving problems related to ensuring safety. The 
article explains in greater detail the new safety concepts set 
forth in OPB-88 and describes work on the development of 
Integrated NTD that regulates problems of ensuring safety of 
dangerous nuclear and radiation facilities.

the ``Problems, Search, Solutions'' rubric] 
  [Abstract] The article deals with problems of improving 
the safety of RBMK reactors, particularly RBMK 1000. Due to the 
effect of the neutron flux the geometric shape and dimensions of 
graphite stacking blocks and fuel channels (FC) change the hole 
diameter of graphite blocks decreases, the graphite stacking 
contracts, and the FC diameter increases. The result decreased 
clearance between the FCs and graphite stacking. The design 
clearance between the FC and graphite stacking in the first unit 
reactor of the Leningrad AES decreased prematurely because the 
actual rate of change of the above parameters exceeded the 
design rate. A decision was made to replace all fuel channels 
and bore out graphite stacking holes for the channels. The 
repair work took 10 months and was done during a single reactor 
shut down. A technological process of restoring the clearance 
was developed; it is described in great detail. Repair equipment 
and fixtures were designed at NIKIMT, VNIIAES and TsNIITS 
[expansions not given] and LAES [Leningrad AES] and manufactured 
at NIKIMT, NIKIET, VNIIAES, NPO ``Krasnaya zvezda'', PNITI, FEI, 
TsKBM [expansion not given], LAES and IAE [Atomic Energy 
Institute] imeni Kurchatov enterprises. Main types of equipment 
used for the repair (the cutting mechanism, welding equipment 
and repair fixtures used for FC replacement and boring of 
graphite blocks) are described.

  [Abstract] The Yuzhnoye design bureau has designed a number 
of windmills for energy production using CAD packages. The YeSKD 
package creates drawings and transmits information to other 
programs. It is based on AUTOCAD 10.0 and has a program package 
written in AUTOLISP. The ASSISTENT system automates the 
production of design documentation. SKHEMA designs circuitry and 
conduit for electrical, pneumatic, pneumatic-hydraulic, 
kinematic, and other types of systems. SPETSIFIK formulates 
specifications and uses guidebooks to standardize parts, 
materials and nomenclature. These program packages are 
general-purpose systems for machine building. Yuzhnoye developed 
a program to determine the aerodynamic properties of windwheels 
with a horizontal axis of rotation. The program is written in 
FORTRAN. The automated control system of one windwheel is 
described The problems of designing these systems are discussed. 
A proposal to construct a system to automatically regulate the 
angular velocity of a windwheel is discussed. Figures 2.

  [Abstract] As the lead organization, the Scientific 
Research Institute of Thermal Instruments is developing the 
Kvint computer system for computerizing the engineering 
processes at heat-and- electric power stations. Kvint represents 
one of the first functionally complex domestic systems of its 
kind and computerizes the collection and preliminary processing 
of information, engineering process control, logic-program 
control, priority control, locking, online control, alarming, 
information archival, event recording, calculations offline, and 
information transfer. The system is based on a problem-oriented 
approach, distributed automatic control, centralized monitoring, 
object-oriented control, production programming, self-diagnosis 
and sample redundancy, and project configuration. Kvint has a 
four-level architecture -- field, controller, systems, and 
production -- each level of which uses its own local network or 
several similar networks. The development is proceeding in two 
stages, with design bureaus from Ivano-Frankovsk, Cheboksary, 
and Moscow taking part. The Moscow- based All-Russian 
Heat-Engineering Institute is developing the hardware 
requirements for the Seriya 200, the first stage of the 
development. Figures 3.

  [Abstract] Giprouglemash and the Bryansk Machine Building 
Company are designing pumping units and stations for mechanized 
supports, water removal systems, water injection units used in 
coal beds, and high-pressure irrigation systems. The series of 
pumping stations features pressures from 20-63 MPa, and a 
delivery rate of 30-400 l/min. The series has 22, 37, 55, and 
110 kW models. Gravitational extraction is used in the filtering 
system. These pumping stations consume less power than their 
predecessors and are half the weight. Their most vulnerable 
parts (for example, the plungers) are reinforced for a longer 
lifetime. Figures 2.

  [Abstract] Traditional 
means of mechanizing and automating existing technology have 
been exhausted. The creation of robotic equipment (primarily 
manipulator arms) to perform extraction operations is described. 
The use of robotics can sharply increase mechanization of mining 
operations in the entire extraction area, automate monitoring 
and control operations, and determine the actual efficiency of 
use of cutting machines, and the adaptability of machines for 
complex geological and mining conditions. The difficulties in 
replacing a human operator, primarily human cognitive functions 
are discussed. It is noted that all the pieces are in place for 
the use of robotics, but they have yet to be applied to mining 
operations.

  [Abstract] Scientific research and design planning work 
aimed at development of seismically stable thermal power plants 
and electric power networks is conducted by Teploelektroproekt 
in cooperation with VNIIG imeni B.Ye. Vedeneyev, 
Rostovteploelektroproekt and Energosetproekt. The first draft of 
additional requirements to the design of TPPs [thermal power 
plants] located in seismic areas has been developed. The work 
was necessitated by a substantial increase in the frequency of 
seismic activity in earthquake prone regions of the country 
where thermal power plants operate, are being built or scheduled 
for construction. Analysis of the effect of the 1988 Spitak 
earthquake on power generating facilities corroborated the need 
for this work. Causes of earthquake caused damage to power 
plants were determined, and specific ways to improve seismic 
stability of their buildings and facilities have been outlined. 
Foreign experience was also taken into account. The additional 
requirements have been substantiated. At present a TPP is 
considered seismically stable if it remains ecologically and 
technologically safe in a maximum rated earthquake (MRE) with a 
once in a 1000 years probability and provides uninterrupted 
supply of electric power and heat after a design earthquake (DE) 
with a once in a 100 years probability. Because TPP buildings 
and facilities have different functions, a differentiated 
approach to designing them for seismic stability is used. 
However, it is suggested that it is more expedient to design all 
TPP buildings, facilities and equipment for the same level of 
seismic action with the frequency of once every 100 years. Based 
on the analysis and results of the work 13 additional 
requirements are presented.

  [Abstract] Dynamic contact problems of isotropic and 
anisotropic theory of elasticity for massive and weightless dies 
lying on the surface of a medium simulated by either a layer or 
half-plane have been studied in sufficient detail. This type of 
problems are topical in foundation construction, vibroseismical 
prospecting and when designing various critical structures 
operating under complex dynamic conditions. But taking into 
account the actual plate depth and anisotropy of the foundation 
call far a different approach based on the method of boundary 
integral equations. The article examines the problem of steady 
state oscillations of a massive die connected to a foundation 
that is an orthotropic half-plane with an uneven boundary; in a 
particular case the die can be embedded into the half-plane to a 
certain depth. The derived special basic solutions make it 
possible to formulate boundary integral equations (BIEs) for the 
finite portion of the half-plane boundary. The use of a classic 
version of the boundary elements method with the simplest 
approximation of contact stresses makes it possible to reduce 
the resulting BIE system to a linear algebraic system. Results 
of calculations for various frequencies depending on the number 
of elements used. Figures 2, references 8.

  [Abstract] A predictive scenario of landscape-climatic 
conditions to the year 2000 is proposed for Western Siberia. It 
is based on the principle of paleoclimatic analogues, 
establishing a correlation between the concentrations of carbon 
dioxide gas in the atmosphere and in the ocean surface layer and 
the Earth's global temperatures. The results of 
chronostratigraphic and paleobotanical studies are used in 
reconstructing the landscape-climatic conditions of the Holocene 
climatic optimum which prevailed in Western Siberia about 5500 
years ago because due to the anthropogenic factor it is expected 
that by 2000 the CO[.sub]2[/] level will be restored to the 
conditions observed there during that time. The natural climatic 
changes in Western Siberia, like those for Siberia as a whole, 
fit in quite well with global environmental changes. The 
climatic rhythm established for the Holocene, as well as 
definite refinements obtained using specifically Siberian 
materials, make possible a quite reliable prediction of the 
nature and direction of natural climatic processes in the near 
future. The natural trend, giving evidence of progressive 
cooling, very probably was disrupted in the 1970's by the 
anthropogenic factor leading to global warming. The climate is 
becoming milder, in northern Siberia warmer and moister, whereas 
in the south, in arid steppe regions, it is becoming moister. 
The transformation of landscapes, vegetation zonality, 
permafrost, variations of river runoff and lake levels will 
occur with a definite lag because the rate of anthropogenically 
induced climatic conditions exceeds the natural trend by tens or 
hundreds of times. How soon serious deformations of natural 
systems will begin will evidently be dependent on the climatic 
trend in the 21st century. Figures 6; references 47: 42 Russian, 
5 Western.

  [Abstract] Vertical and inclined sounding methods were 
utilized to study artificial ionospheric disturbances caused 
when payload-carrying rockets are launched into near-earth 
orbit. The data used in the study were gathered from dozens of 
launches. Long-lasting artificial ionospheric disturbances 
recorded by vertical sounding were discussed first. A series of 
46 ionograms taken from an ionospheric station located in 
Karaganda, Kazakhstan, revealed that additional and unusual 
tracks appeared on the ionograms after a launch, and the 
relative frequency, quantity, and duration of the tracks 
depended on the time of year and the time of day. It was 
emphasized that, as a rule, the additional reflections only 
appeared during daylight hours. An explanation was provided for 
the absence of the additional tracks at night, and it was 
concluded that no long-lasting positive deviations of the 
electron concentration from background levels were detected. The 
causes of negative disturbances in the electron concentration 
were then addressed. The ionograms recorded in this part of the 
study looked very much like those obtained when the ionosphere 
is modified by chemical agents. The second part of the paper 
discussed the use of short-wave Doppler inclined sounding of 
artificial ionospheric disturbances. The short-wave signals were 
transmitted in unmodulated carrier mode by broadcast 
transmitters. The signal parameters were recorded simultaneously 
on up to eight frequencies on a synthesizer-type receiver 
located in Tomsk. The signals of the second intermediate 
frequency were mixed with a reference signal with the same 
frequency plus a base frequency component of several hertz 
(e.g., 215 kHz + _D_F). The characteristics of the disturbances 
and the dynamics of their development were described, 
illustrated, and mathematically modelled. The results of the 
ionogram study were fundamentally consistent with the results of 
the inclined sounding study. Figures 5, tables 1; references 27:

  [Abstract] Members of the geography department at Moscow 
State University were commissioned by Russia's Ministry of 
Environmental Protection to draw up a map dividing Russia into 
regions according to their degree of environmental degradation 
and human morbidity. Environmental degradation, or ``stress,'' 
was broadly defined as anthropogenic or natural ecological 
deterioration sufficient to interfere with normal human 
activity. Different sets of criteria were developed and 
elaborated for land, marine, and river ecosystems. These 
criteria were not considered exhaustive. The different regions 
were ranked on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 representing 
environmentally pristine regions, and 5 representing regions 
with severe environmental problems. None of the regions were 
considered environmental disaster areas. An analysis of the map 
yielded the following conclusions: 1) Most of Russia is not 
suffering from appreciable environmental degradation, including 
the northern zone of European Russia; 2) No regions were given a 
ranking of 5, with the exception of some major reservoirs; 3) 
Regions with a ranking of 4 were found only in European Russia; 
4) Regions of moderate environmental stress (up to a ranking of 
2) were found in territories that were otherwise considered to 
have few or no environmental problems. Analogical conclusions 
were drawn for river systems, inland seas, and coastal waters. A 
considerable number of geographical locations were explicitly 
identified, regardless of the degree of environmental damage. No 
direct correlation was found between human morbidity indices and 
the degree of environmental degradation, with the exception of 
areas with exceptionally high morbidity rates, the causes of 
which were too complex for the scope of this study. Figures 1.

  [Abstract] The great length of excess toxic salt removal 
from the soil in rice growing areas (requiring four-to-six years 
to reach the necessary fertility) and the eventual 
resalinization process which requires periodic repeat treatment 
prompted the development of new rice growing practices on 
high-saline salts. The use of the new method developed at the 
Soil Science Institute at the Kazakh Republic's Academy of 
Sciences (NTOZ) is based on using the synergy effect of the new 
low-volume ameliorating agents which alleviate boric toxicosis 
in the soil and plants, eliminate the pathogenic microorganisms, 
and normalize the nutrition conditions. The new practices make 
it possible to inactivate the harmful impact of elementary 
salts, thus leading to higher and biologically more valuable 
yields of rice and other rice rotation crops on highly saline 
soils and salt marshes without washing them beforehand. They are 
also applicable to nonsaline calcareous soils in the arid zone. 
The new methods are implemented by traditional agricultural 
procedures used in rice growing. In NTOZ, the permissible level 
of soil salinity is 15-20 times higher than in conventional rice 
growing practices while the rice vegetation period is shortened 
by 10-12 days. The NTOZ method does not call for new flow or 
spillway systems, special fertilizers, or special tilling 
procedures. Tables 2.

  [Abstract] In the past few years, the new disease stem 
brown-spot, which is caused by the fungus Phomopsis 
(Diaporthe) helianthi), has been appearing on sunflowers in 
Western, Central, and Eastern Europe. The disease has been 
referred to by various names, including sunflower phomopsis in 
the Western literature. Sunflower stem brown-spot was first 
detected in Russia in the Stavropol Kray in 1990. Foci of the 
disease have since been recorded in the other regions of the 
Stavropol and Krasnodar krays, Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, and 
Rostov Oblast of the Central Caucasus and in three oblasts in 
the Central Chernozem region. Mycological and phytopathological 
analyses of specimens of brown-spot-infected sunflower stems 
collected throughout the affected regions confirmed Ph. 
helianthi, which was first identified as the cause of 
sunflower stem canker in Yugoslavia in 1981 and first detected 
in the former USSR in 1985, to be the causative agent. Studies 
have shown that one of the reasons for the appearance of stem 
brown-spot now is the fact that infected seed material from 
affected regions of the former USSR are still being used. 
Further spread of the disease through contaminated seed material 
is also likely. Ph. helianthi has a definite 
variability that is manifested in pure cultures in the form of 
different colorations of the mycelium, in the formation of two 
types of spores in the pycnidium (_a_- and _b_-spores in the 
strains A and B, respectively), and in variation of its 
pathogenic properties to sunflower specimens. Strains with _a_- 
and _b_- spores in their pycnidia have been established to have 
a similar pathogenicity upon artificial inoculation. Both 
strains have shown definite intraspecial physiological and 
morphological diversity. Ph. helianthi thrives at 
higher temperatures than other sunflower pathogens 
(Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis 
cinerea) do. In various nutrient media, Ph. 
helianthi growth and spore formation are most intense 
between 20 and 25C. Growth and development of the fungus 
are sharply inhibited by 30C, and they cease completely at 
35C. Field studies have shown the disease to be most 
intense at air temperatures of 10 to 20C with absolute 
temperature fluctuations from 5.6C at night to 28.3C 
during the day. The most effective preventive measures appear to 
be the use of resistant varieties and the use of fungicides. 
Russian research to protect sunflowers against the disease has 
been extremely limited. The sunflower lines VIR 130 and VIR 160 
and the hybrid Krasnodarskiy 885 appear to have the highest 
resistance to stem brown-spot, whereas the varieties 
Berezanskiy, Yenisey, and Ultraskorospelyy appear to have the 
lowest resistance. Studies conducted abroad have established 
several fungicides that appear to be effective against the 
disease. The fungicides Ronilan and Rovral have been approved 
for use on sunflowers in Russia. Fungicides should be applied to 
sunflowers three times: before they button, when or soon after 
they first flower, and at the end of flowering. Tables 5; 
references 13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] The lack of general understanding of the 
receptors involved, the structural arrangement of natural 
peptides, and molecules' conformational capabilities which 
characterize recent studies of the physiological mechanism of 
natural oligopeptides and especially peptide hormones 
necessitated a search for a direct relationship between the 
chemical structure and physiological action. As a consequence, a 
new approach to studying the biological activity of natural 
oligopeptide whereby the investigation proceeds from the 
structure to the function, i.e., in a direction opposite to that 
of existing approaches, was developed by the authors. It is 
rooted in the understanding of the structural arrangement of the 
low-molecular peptide molecules, a direct correlation between 
the conformational capabilities of a number of peptide hormones 
and their physiological action, and an assumption of the 
principal similarity of the physical and chemical origin of the 
hormone-receptor and enzyme-substrate interactions. The natural 
oligopeptide structural-functional organization principles 
underlying the approach are outlined. The study pursues two 
goals simultaneously: to establish the structural-functional 
arrangement of the angiotensin II molecule with the help of a 
known approach to examining natural oligopeptides (a more 
particular task) and testing the approach used in the specific 
analysis and assessing its actual capabilities (a more general 
task). The study shows that the angiotensin II molecule 
organization is, in essence, described by a set of low-energy 
conformational states of several groups which are easily 
transformed one into another. The two most energy- and 
entropy-wise efficient groups are identified and the geometrical 
parameters of their representatives are summarized. The values 
of the dihedral angles of the backbone and side amino acid 
hormone residual chains are calculated, and the energy of the 
intra- and inter-residual interactions of all potentially 
physiologically active conformations is evaluated. The findings 
are compared to numerous published sources. Figures 5; tables 7; 
references 45: 13 Russian, 32 Western.

  [Abstract] The immunomodulating properties of 
muramyldipeptide (MDP)--a minimal structure of the bacterium 
cell wall--capable of substituting for the microbacterial 
component and affecting the central nervous system and a lack of 
complete understanding of the molecular principles of the effect 
of muramyl peptides (MP)--a glycopeptide which contains muramic 
acid--prompted the development of an original approach to 
studying the receptors of biologically active ligands with the 
help of anti-idiotypic antibodies. To utilize this approach to 
examining the muramyl peptide receptor, an attempt is made to 
produce monoclonal antibodies to 
N-acetylglucosaminyl-(_b_1-4)-N-acetylmuramyl-alanyl-D-isoglutamine 
(GMDP)--a biologically active analogue of muramyldipeptide--for 
subsequent use of these antibodies for producing anti-idiotypic 
antibodies to GMDP. The GMDP conjugates to MeBSA and 
poly[(D, L-Ala)[.sub]n[/] Lys] (GMDP-AL) were 
synthesized in the peptide chemistry lab of the Shemyakin 
Institute while the GMDP conjugate to ovalbumin (GMDP-OVA) were 
produced using water-soluble carbodiimide (EDAC) according to 
Bahr, Garelli, et al. A prolonged immunization 
procedure was selected for immunizing mice with the GMDP-MeBSA 
conjugate. The hybridoma E6/1.2 line was produced by fusing 
splenocytes of mice immunized with the GMDP conjugates to 
methylated bull serum albumin (MeBSA) and cells of the SP2/0 
myeloma line. The E6/1.2 line is capable of producing monoclonal 
antibodies to GMDP. The E6/1.2 MCAs are classified as belonging 
to the IgG1 subtype and have an affinity constant to GMDP of 
2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/]. Based on data of 
a competitive enzymatic immunoassay analysis, the 
GlcNAc(_b_1-4)-MurNAc carbohydrate fragment and the first amino 
acid, i.e., alanine, make the largest contribution to these 
antibodies' interaction with GMDP. The conclusion is drawn that 
E6/1.2 MCAs are highly affine and interact specifically with 
GMDP, making it possible to use them for producing hybridoma 
which, in turn, produce monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies 
simulating the spatial GMDP structure. Figures 3; references 19:

  [Abstract] Continuing interest in finding new restriction 
endonucleases aimed at discovering new prototypes or more 
practicable isoschizomers prompted a study of approximately 200 
strains isolated by routine methods from the soil in various 
regions throughout Russia. The strains were selected on the 
basis of the following criteria: the thermophilic property of 
the bacteria, the ability to generate endospores, and the 
possibility of using conventional and easily available nutrient 
media, such as RPA and RPB, for cultivating microorganisms. The 
experimental procedure is described. As a result, 26 feasible 
products of restriction endonucleases were isolated; recognition 
sequences were identified for all 26 products and cleavage 
sites--for 15 of them. It is demonstrated that the enzymes are 
isoschizomers of the following known endonucleases: 
BstNI, EarI, HaeIII, 
HpaII, Cfr10I, BsiYI, 
BclI, BbvII, BbvI, 
BstEII, BsaBI, BsrI, 
FspI, ClaI, and SfeI. The 
findings make it possible to assert that thermophilic bacteria 
of the Bacillus genus are a promising source of 
restriction endonucleases. Tables 1; references 5: 4 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] The diversity of biological activity of 
interleukin-1 (IL-1) which is a mixture of two polypeptides 
IL-1_a_ and IL-1_b_ and can serve as a mediator of various 
diseases as well as host's protective mechanisms prompted 
renewed interest in the recently characterized protein factor--a 
natural IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) which specifically 
blocks IL-1 binding to receptors in T-cells and fibroblasts but 
does not bind to IL-1 proper and does not have its biological 
activity. With respect to the foregoing, an attempt is made to 
investigate the possibility of developing a plasmid construction 
which contains the IL-1ra gene and is suitable for oriented 
mutagenesis and expression in prokaryotic systems. To this end, 
a mature IL-1ra gene is constructed with the help of a 
polymerase chain reaction (PTsR) using the mRNA[.sup].[/]cDNA 
hybrid as a template. The experimental procedure of constructing 
a primer and synthesizing the gene is described in detail. Two 
in vitro recombinations using the resulting mutant 
DNAs on the KpnI/Eco47III and 
Eco47III/HindIII sites with recloning into 
the pDR540 expressing vector which does not contain the 
KpnI site made it possible to eliminate mutations 
causing amino acid substitutions and produce a gene which 
precisely encodes the earlier described 152-link sequence of 
mature IL-1ra. The authors are grateful to S.A. Ketloinskiy, 
Ye.I. Shvarts, O.K. Kaboyev, and O.V. Plutalov for help with 
preparations and synthesis. References 11: 1 Russian, 10 Western.

  [Abstract] The urgency of selecting an effective polymer 
carrier for solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis and the high 
cost of Porasil, Fractosil, etc., HPLC silica gels prompted 
attempts to synthesize a highly effective carrier for solid 
phase oligonucleotide synthesis on the basis of the easily 
accessible domestic microspherical aerosilica gel--Silochrome-2 
with a synthetic spacer group. The particle size, specific 
surface, and mean pore diameter of silicate carriers for solid 
phase oligonucleotide synthesis are summarized, and the factors 
which determine their effectiveness are outlined. The carrier 
has sufficient mechanical strength and can be successfully used 
in automatic synthesizers. The specific requirements imposed on 
the spacers are discussed, and it is noted that spacer groups 
containing longer aliphatic fragments bend more easily and 
``stick'' to the polymer's hydrophobic surface, thus shortening 
the distance between the oligonucleotide and the carrier and 
decreasing its effectiveness. Consequently, a spacer group with 
a shorter fragment--ehtylenediamine--and a carrier synthesis 
method are developed, and the aerosilica gel amination procedure 
is outlined. The resulting carriers have a close-to-optimum 
25-35 mole/g capacity resulting in a condensation reaction 
yield of 97.5-99%. The performance of the proposed carrier 
fully corresponds to best known carriers on the basis of the CPG 
porous glass, yet the new material is much cheaper and more 
easily available. The proposed spacer design also ensures high 
yields and purity. The authors are grateful to G. Panasenko for 
proving a Silochrome-2 sample. Figures 1; tables 1; references

  [Abstract] The work reported here is based on the 
assumption of dynamic domain organization of receptor molecules 
in biological membranes. According to that concept, the receptor 
molecules are structural elements of the cyclic process of the 
formation and decay of receptor domains, and they catalyze 
biochemical cell transformations, transport substances across 
membrane barriers, and generate cyclic electrical and 
biochemical changes. Cyclomononucleotides and inositol 
triphosphate operate as biochemical modulators of ion-channel 
permeability by blocking Ca- binding centers of gate mechanisms 
of receptor-domain ion channels, thereby mobilizing 
Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions in the cell from intracellular calcium 
depots and from the surrounding medium. Kinetic diagrams of the 
operation of the gate mechanisms are provided for instances in 
which ions or molecules capable of blocking just one Ca-binding 
center are present along with the Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions. Figures

  [Abstract] The irreversible chemical processes occurring in 
molasses during storage which make them unsuitable for use as a 
carbon source in lysine production by microbiological methods 
and reports that molasses can be easily substituted with acetic 
acid and cereals and fruits and vegetables as well as the 
urgency of developing new feed lysine production methods using 
nonstandard fruit and vegetable raw materials prompted an 
investigation into the possibility of producing lysine by 
bioconversion of various types of fruit and vegetable raw 
materials. To this end, the Brevibacterium sp. 
culture cultivated in 750 ml bulbs containing 25-30 ml of 
nutrient medium in a circular rocker spinning at a 220-240 RPM 
speed for 24-72 h was used. The experimental procedure is 
outlined. The quantity of lysine forming during fermentation was 
measured by thin layer chromatography. The carbohydrate 
composition of the fruit and vegetable media, the outcome of 
lysine biosynthesis in media with various carbohydrate 
concentrations, and a comparative characterization of the lysine 
development process in media from fresh and long-stored raw 
materials (apples, carrots, beats, cabbage, and various 
combinations thereof) are summarized. The study demonstrates 
that various types of such raw materials may indeed be used as 
the substrate for microbial synthesis of lysine from the 
Brevibacterium sp. culture and shows that 
bioconversion occurs at a varying degree of effectiveness. 
Complex media ensuring a high level of substrate conversion into 
lysine are selected. An analysis confirms that any plant raw 
material can be used successfully for producing lysine. The new 
method makes it possible to solve the problem of fruit and 
vegetable waste utilization, reduce environmental pollution, and 
supply a valuable animal feed supplement. Tables 3; references

  [Abstract] Extensive uses of citric acid--an important 
organic acid for the food, medical, and pharmaceutical 
industries--due to its low toxicity and easy metabolism and the 
advantages of glucose in citric acid production by fermentation 
are noted; moreover, the use of glucose during Aspergillus 
niger fermentation greatly facilitates research into the 
patterns of citric acid biosynthesis under continuous 
fermentation. Today, the Charles Pfizer Inc. and Miles 
Laboratories Inc. companies, both in the United States, are the 
largest citric acid producers. Despite considerable successes in 
the citric acid production methods by periodic fermentation, 
search is underway for a continuous method utilizing both 
A. niger and n-paraffins with Candida 
lipolytica, yet persistent problems of the continuous 
cultivation method, e.g., a drop in the citric acid 
concentration in the medium with a transition to continuous 
operation, prompted a comparative study of the biomass and 
citric acid biosynthesis by the A. niger culture from 
glucose under periodic and continuous fermentation. To this end, 
the A. niger fungus is used. The cultivation 
procedure is outlined. It is noted that in order to optimize the 
nutrient medium composition and avoid precipitating heavy metal 
salts thus eliminating the possibility of using the fungal 
biomass as a feed additive, the fungus was cultivated in a 
specially selected water-mineral medium containing glucose as 
the carbon source. The citric acid biosynthesis yield under 
these conditions depends on the cell concentration in the 
medium, the medium dilution rate, and diffusion properties of 
the culture. The study reveals the possibility of realizing 
two-stage fermentation: a biomass accumulation stage and induced 
citric acid excretion stage. The latter is facilitated by 
dimethylsulfoxide which is continuously added to the medium at 
the second fermentation stage at a 0.5% concentration. As 
a 
result, the citric acid concentration is higher that after 
conventional two-stage cultivation without induced excretion. 
The findings make it possible to develop stable and intensive 
citric acid production. Figures 9; references 13: 7 Russian, 6 
Western.

  [Abstract] Earlier mammal studies aimed at evaluating the 
genetic consequences of the elevated radiation background in the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant area are continued, and the 
genetic variations in mice exposed in 1989 to 14-, 22-, and 
34-day irradiation within the 10-km Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant zone are examined; an attempt is made to investigate the 
dependence of the genetic effect in sex cells on the exposure 
duration, animal hemotype, and the ontogenesis stage affected by 
the exposure. To this end, (CBAxC57BL)F[.sub]1[/] hybrid mice 
of both sexes and sexually mature C57BL males in wire mesh cages 
are studied at a surface dose (measured by a DP-5 radiation 
monitor) averaging 60 mR/h. In addition, DTG-4 and MKDT 
radiation monitors were used for determining the absorbed 
_g_-radiation dose and the cumulative absorbed _g_- and 
_b_-radiation. The genetic effect of radiation on the sex cell 
was evaluated by the dominant lethal mutation (DLM) rate 
characterized by the embryo mortality before and after 
implantation; by the frequency of abnormal spermia heads (AGS), 
and by the rate of reciprocal translocations (RT) induced at the 
diakinesis stage. The study reveals a linear dependence of the 
induced effect on the absorbed dose magnitude. Among the animals 
irradiated during the embryonic development period, a male who 
is heterozygotic with respect to the reciprocal translocation is 
identified. No unambiguous relationship between the genetic 
effect and mice genotype was revealed. The findings can be used 
for quantitative estimates of the genetic danger from radiation 
for humans. The authors are grateful to V.S. Lysenkova, G.A. 
Vilkina, K.N. Yarovoy, and A.I. Shaks for assistance. Figures 4;

  [Abstract] The pressure exerted by man-caused environmental 
factors on natural ecosystems and the urgency of correlating the 
changes in the radiation conditions in the environment and the 
growth of the mutation burden in populations with their 
adaptation capabilities prompted a reexamination of the 
electrophoretic analysis of pine seed proteins Pinus 
sylvestris L. exposed to irradiation after the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant accident in order to assess the genetic 
impact of the Chernobyl accident on the pine forest, set up 
radiation-environmental monitoring in the population relocation 
area's reforestation plantings at the molecular level, and 
ascertain the extent to which these data can be used to predict 
long-term genetic consequences on the nature's other creatures 
and humans. A list of enzymes with the number of their scored 
gene loci and commission code number, examples of abnormal 
heritability products of enzyme gene loci revealed by the 
electrophoresis study, the frequencies of various types of 
enzyme gene loci mutations induced by ionizing radiation in 
Pinus sylvestris L. macrospores after the accident, 
the genetic efficiency of radiation in the relocation area based 
on Pinus sylvestris L. data, and the rate of loci 
mutation which are encoding the enzyme synthesis in Pinus 
sylvestris L. endosperms in the relocation area are 
summarized, and the dependence of the viable seed yield and 
various types of mutations on the dosage rate is plotted. The 
findings confirm that the pine is a convenient test system which 
makes it possible to take into account the mutations induced at 
the hametic level, thus making a certain contribution to 
developing forecasts of long-term genetic consequences as they 
apply to other species where observation of mutations is 
complicated due to biological or ethical considerations. The 
authors are grateful to the Corresponding Member of the Academy 
Yu.P. Altukhov for valuable remarks. Figures 2; tables 4;

  [Abstract] The unique ability of glomal bacteria 
(Rhizobia) to bind atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis 
with bean plants prompted an attempt to demonstrate the role 
Rhizobium meliloti leucine biosynthesis genes in the 
development of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa. To this 
end, the strains HB101 and S17.1 of Escherichia coli 
and the CXM 1 strain of Rhizobium meliloti as well as 
the pRK2013, pSUP2021, and pLAFR5 plasmids are used in the 
experiment. A leucine-auxotrophic mutant strain CXM1 which has 
lost its ability to form nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa 
is produced by nonspecific transposonic mutagenesis using the 
pSUP2021 plasmid (Tn5) as the donor. The study shows that the 
addition of leucine directly to the plants inoculated with the 
auxotrophic mutant does not restore its ability to develop 
normal symbiosis. Large-scale screening of four types of alfalfa 
under sterile microvegetation conditions reveals the absence of 
interstrain variability and the existence of individual 
variability based on the behavior of host plant response to 
leucine auxotrophic inoculation. A bank of CXM1 strains is 
constructed on the basis of the cosmid pLAFR5 vector and used in 
conjugation cross-breeding for the purpose of complementing 
leucine auxotrophe. The findings also indicate that the leucine 
biosynthesis genes are involved in regulating the development of 
nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa. The results lay the 
groundwork for a more detailed study of the relationship between 
the leucine biosynthesis and the expression of symbiotic 
properties in these bacteria. The authors are grateful to T.V. 
Ivashina and N.A. Provorov for assisting with the gene bank and 
making valuable remarks. Figures 5; tables 2; references 21: 3

  [Abstract] The system for selecting rec[.sup]-[/] yeast 
mutants based on taking into account the interplasmid 
recombination proposed earlier by the authors is examined 
further, and the findings of a study of one mutant which was 
produced with the help of this system and is characterized by a 
decreased interplasmid recombination frequency are presented. 
The rec41 mutant under study was produced from the 2D-3031 
haploid strain. The study indicates that rec41-1 mutation lowers 
the efficiency of double-strand DNA break repairs due to the 
interplasmid and, possibly, interchromosomal and interchromatide 
recombination, leading to an elevated sensitivity of the mutant 
cells to ionizing radiation. An incomplete block of repair and 
recombination processes in rec41 mutant cells is probably due to 
the rec41-1 mutation phenotype. The REC41 gene was cloned in the 
pL3 multicopy vector. Integration mapping shows that the REC41 
gene is located on the left arm of the VII chromosome, very 
close to the LYS5 gene. Plans for sequencing this gene and 
further investigating its genetic properties are outlined.

<F P=106> [Interview by MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Yelina </F>
Tokarenko with Vyacheslav Valentinovich Lyakhovich, professor 
and corresponding member, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, 
and head of the Molecular Pathology and Ecological Biochemistry 
Institute, Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences under the ``New in Science'' rubric: ``Barrier to 
Xenobiotics''] 
  [Text] [Boxed item: Novosibirsk scientists are proposing 
new methods of protection against chemical aggression.] 
  Do you know how many chemicals surround us in our everyday 
life or that are used in industry and agriculture? More than 
80,000. And according to forecasts, in less than a decade this 
figure will double or triple. Many of them manifest mutagenic, 
carcinogenic, and teratogenic properties fully justifying the 
name xenobiotic (from the Greek word meaning ``foreign to 
life''). And by the way, they include not only the notorious 
pesticides but also the inks, copy machine paper, and printer's 
ink without which this article could not have come to light. 
Comparatively complete ecological and toxicology tests have only 
been conducted on several chemicals of natural and anthropogenic 
origin, however. It is virtually impossible to keep pace with 
all of the new modifications. That is why knowledge about the 
mechanisms and laws of biotransformation of xenobiotics in the 
body must be systematized to at least some extent and why the 
processes must be studied at the molecular level. This is the 
key to the problem of chemical aggression overall and to the 
search for a suitable ``antidote.'' The Molecular Pathology and 
Ecological Biochemistry Institute of the Siberian Department of 
the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences has research priority in 
this field. It was born (it was established only 2 years ago) 
out of the social demand of the region, which had become the 
hostage of technocratic thinking and thoughtless ``subjugation 
of nature.'' Basic research on the biotransformation of 
xenobiotics under the direction of V. Lyakhovich, professor, 
corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, 
and head of the institute, has already been going on for 20 
years. This research has made it possible to substantiate and 
develop advanced methods of diagnosing, treating, and preventing 
ecologically induced diseases and to monitor health at the 
individual and population levels. V. Lyakhovich responds to the 
questions of our MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA correspondent. 
  [Tokarenko]Vyacheslav Valentinovich, you are 
essentially contemplating a new, higher level of assessing the 
medical consequences of environmental pollution and predicting 
disease based on modern molecular biology methods? 
  [Lyakhovich]Unfortunately, medical ecology has 
been pretty much restrained in a verification stage, and even 
the scientific literature is essentially devoted to describing 
toxic effects while their role in measuring functional as well 
as biochemical parameters is either assumed with caution or else 
not assumed at all. By the way, it is precisely these indicators 
that are the most adequate criteria of the potentially hazardous 
effect of environmental pollution on man and animals. They make 
it possible to determine the level of xenobiotics' penetration 
into the body and their biologically active doses, and they make 
it possible to judge reactions that are now occurring and to 
reliably predict the risk of disease. Am increasing number of 
scientists are even classifying drug therapy as a 
``pharmacologic press'' that, together with chemical factors in 
the environment, may affect human ecology as a whole. 
  [Tokarenko]And what has become the main focus of 
attention? 
  [Lyakhovich]The body contains enzyme systems 
effecting the biotransformation of foreign compounds localized 
in the cells of the liver, kidneys, and lungs. These enzymes 
catalyze a number of oxidation-reduction reactions and 
conjugation reactions. There are rather many of them. Without 
going into very specific details, I will only say that various 
biotransformation routes may, under the effect of external 
factors, also result in detoxication of a xenobiotic or else 
may, on the other hand, be accompanied by the formation of even 
more toxic components. Specifically, knowledge of these fine 
points makes it possible to conduct biomonitoring of the 
chemical effect of the environment by evaluating xenobiotic 
metabolism systems. 
  [Tokarenko]And how is this done? 
  [Lyakhovich]We focused our attention on proteins 
(cytochrome P-450) capable of transforming polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (and also dioxins, biphenyls, etc.) into products 
carrying the threat of cancers and all possible abnormalities. 
These proteins only begin to ``work'' when the body comes into 
contact with chemical factors of the environment. And so as it 
turned out, many dozens and even hundreds of compounds cause the 
same response in the body -- expression of genes of the 
cytochrome P-450 family. This means that it is possible to get 
by without laborious (and yes expensive) routine studies 
analyzing each of the components of technogenic poisoning. 
  These works have been postulated as the basis of a system of 
methods for the biomonitoring of chemical pollution. 
Experimental animals act as a ``barometer.'' The method was 
successfully tested in Altay, in the Kuzbas, and in the 
Novosibirsk and several other oblasts that are in an adverse 
ecological situation. In addition to everything else, the method 
makes it possible to estimate the total effect of pollution on 
the body, which is still difficult to do by other methods, and 
to determine clear-cut criteria for formulating groups at risk 
of specific diseases just as was done at the Azot and Soda 
enterprises and at the titanium-magnesium combine in the Perm 
Oblast. 
  [Tokarenko] A prediction is a prediction, but 
what about treatment?.. 
  [Lyakhovich]A hybridoma process for obtaining 
monoclonal antibodies to specific isoforms of cytochrome P-450 
has been developed at our institute. A bank of monoclonal 
antibodies suitable for suppressing the activity of these 
enzymes has been developed. 
  [Tokarenko]Is it thought that your research 
should provide a clear-cut picture of the effect of 
``chemistry'' on offspring? 
  [Lyakhovich]One block of work is simultaneously 
related just to the transplacental transport of chemical 
compounds from mother to fetus. Specific recommendations apply 
to both pregnant women who come into contact with chemical 
compounds and to their offspring. We put them into special risk 
groups. The most insidious are organochlorine pesticides (such 
as DDT). They are lipidophilic. They accumulate in adipose 
tissues, reach significant toxic concentrations, and then poison 
the fetus by penetrating through the placenta and cause 
stillbirth. 
  [Tokarenko]In what other areas can you interest 
clinical medicine? 
  [Lyakhovich]There is yet another example where 
the results of basic works are used in practice. A cycle of 
research studies was conducted in Mirnyy, Nobosibirsk, and 
Novokuznetsk. It was related to what is termed metabolic status 
as determined by test drugs. This means the dynamics of liver 
function. Depending on the activity of their metabolic 
processes, individuals are classified as ``fast'' or ``slow'' 
metabolizers. Along with this comes different predisposition to 
selected diseases. 
  The first group includes individuals who are especially 
susceptible to harmful habits and to the effect of negative 
factors associated with industry. They accounted for about 8 
percent of the workers from toxic industries whom we studied, 
and they are at high risk of colorectal cancer and breast 
cancer. Persons with slow metabolization -- approximately 4 
percent of those studied -- have a tendency toward bladder and 
throat cancer. As complications of drug therapy, they may 
possibly develop allergies and systemic lupus erythematosus. It 
is significant that every ``ultraslow'' metabolizer suffers from 
intolerance of some drug or foodstuff. 
  [Tokarenko]And with what is this type of 
gradation linked? 
  [Lyakhovich]The phenomenon of ``fast'' and 
``slow'' metabolizers has been explained at the level of the 
gene apparatus. It has become clear that the bodies of persons 
who are ``slow'' metabolizers contain 100 to 200 times fewer 
enzymes involved in oxidation of xenobiotics. The cause is a 
defect of specified genes. Differences in metabolic status are 
very significant in different ethnic groups. Oligonucleotide 
primer-probes synthesized at the institute can be used along 
with the technique of amplification to successfully detect more 
than 95 percent of cytochrome P-450 dB gene mutations. This will 
help clinicians select individual drug therapy with 
consideration of the metabolic status. We are already using 
techniques based on the method to study the populations of 
Altay, Siberia, and the Far North.

  [Abstract] The possibility of selective suppression of the 
gene expression with the help of short oligonucleotides which 
are complementary to target mRNA (antisense oligonucleotides) 
and a lack of complete understanding of the mechanism of cell 
penetration by oligonucleotides and their interaction with the 
cell biopolymers prompted an attempt to identify the proteins 
which bind oligonucleotides in the cell nucleus. To this end, 
reaction-capable oligonucleotide derivatives with the same cell 
penetration parameters as the original oligonucleotides were 
used; these oligonucleotides with different compositions 
(1.GTGACGTCAG, 2.T(p)T[.sub]15[/], and 3.T(AC)[.sub]6[/]) 
were synthesized by the phosphotriester method. The experimental 
procedure is outlined. The use of oligonucleotides carrying 
reaction-capable radicals of aromatic 1-chlorethylamine in 
5'-terminal phosphates which covalent-attach the oligonucleotide 
derivatives to the cell's biopolymers made it possible to detect 
peptides with a molecular mass of 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 kDa 
specifically interacting with the nucleic part of the 
derivatives in nuclear extracts of mice and human mammalian 
cells. Similar proteins with a 1,5 and 3.0 kDa molecular mass 
were also detected in insect, plant, yeast, and bacteria cells. 
It is speculated that oligonucleotides penetrate the cell by 
pinocytosis, possibly through mediation by specific receptors, 
yet their subsequent fate, including the appearance in the 
nucleus, remains unclear. A study of the effect of 
oligonucleotides with varying length, plasmid DNA, and tRNA from 
yeast and poly-(A)RNA shows that the proteins modified by 
alkylating oligonucleotide derivatives are not specific to the 
origin of nucleic acids. The proliferation of the above proteins 
with a 1.5 and 3.0 kDa mass (isolated from cell nuclei of 
Blatella germanica cockroach, Begonia sp. 
plants, Sacharomices cerevisiae yeast, and extract of 
Escherichia coli cells) attests to their 
participation in important cell activity processes. Figures 4;

  [Abstract] Successful applications of antisense 
oligonucleotides and their derivatives for specifically 
inhibiting the gene expression in various eucaryotic systems 
prompted a research effort aimed at identifying segments of the 
tick-borne encephalitis virus RNA sequence which are most 
sensitive to the effect of oligonucleotides in order to develop 
effective virus reproduction. To this end, mRNA-E', mRNA-N3S, 
mRNA-2BNS3, and mRNA-NS34A4B' which encode the tick-borne 
encephalitis virus (VKE) proteins were used while genetically 
engineered analogues of tick-borne encephalitis virus proteins 
were obtained from the Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at the 
Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences in 
Novosibirsk. The experimental procedure is outlined. To select 
RNA segments most accessible to oligonucleotide binding and to 
compare the oligonucleotide efficiency, the matrix structure was 
assessed using the computational methods described by Solovyev 
and Kel. The study reveals that an oligonucleotide complementary 
to such a protein segment at a 2.5 M concentration 
suppresses 
biosynthesis of the full-scale protein almost completely and 
leads to generation of a shorter product. The in 
vitro study demonstrates that the most effective inhibition 
is probably due to the fact that the 40S ribosome subunit cannot 
destroy stable duplexes in the 5'-nontranslated mRNA area, as a 
result of which the translation initiation is disrupted. The 
findings open up the possibility of developing derivatives for 
suppressing the tick-borne encephalitis virus reproduction in 
mammal cells. The authors are grateful to K.V. Pugachev and V.V. 
Solovyev for providing plasmids and helping with secondary RNA 
structure analyses. Figures 8; tables 1; references 15: 4

  [Text] Air sampling requires laboratory technicians to 
spend a long time in an atmosphere of toxic substances and to 
endure a significant physical load. This device is intended to 
hold absorbers and filter holders. It can be used by an operator 
to take samples while he is located outside the atmosphere of 
toxic substances. There is a pin 3 threaded into a hole in cover 
2 of an electric-powered aspirator 1 (see figure). A rod 4 made 
from Duralumin tubing with an inside diameter equal to the 
diameter of the pin is mounted on the pin. The length of the 
tubes is varied in height from 60 to 80 cm depending on the air 
sampling requirements. A comb 5 made from an angle (50x50x250 
mm) is mounted on the free end of the rod. It is secured to the 
rod by means of a threaded connection 6, for which purpose the 
corresponding hole is drilled into the horizontal part of the 
comb. There are holes 7 with a diameter of 20-30 mm in the 
horizontal part of the comb for the absorption instruments, and 
slots 8 and 9 of different widths in the vertical part to hold 
the corresponding types of adapters. 
  The device can be used to sample air at heights of 160-170

Shipin, Scientific Research Institute of Microbiology, Main 
Command of the CIS United Armed Forces, Kirov] 
  [Text] Boxing systems, so-called micrological safety or 
protective boxes, are usually used to protect personnel in 
microbiological and virological laboratories working with and 
conducting research on infectious materials. Foreign and 
domestic experience accumulated to this day allows us to 
differentiate boxing systems into different classes depending on 
their structure, which is determined in turn by the danger of 
the infectious material to man and by the nature of the research 
operations and processes. 
  These principles determine division of bioprotection boxes 
into structures which keep the infectious material within the 
volume of the corresponding systems partially (class 1 and 2 
boxes) or completely (class 3 boxes). 
  A modern approach to designing and correctly using boxing 
systems would be impossible without developing scientifically 
substantiated criteria of their protective effectiveness which 
would ensure the required protection for personnel. In turn, the 
necessary protection for personnel must be based on strictly 
grounded infection risk criteria derived from the degree of 
danger of the infectious materials under investigation and of 
the corresponding laboratory operations to which they are 
subjected. 
  Various criteria are used today to describe the protective 
effectiveness of boxing systems depending on their type. For 
class 1 and 2 boxing systems the protection factor is such a 
criterion, while for class 3 boxing systems it is the degree to 
which pressure falls over a certain time in an airtightness 
test. In addition, as was noted above, the risk of infection to 
working personnel in the course of their research, which is a 
probability characteristic, is the regulated parameter 
determining the specific choice of boxing system. The importance 
of developing scientific methodological approaches in this area 
and substantiating, on their basis, optimum requirements on the 
structure of boxing systems depending on the degree of danger of 
research with infectious material carried out within them is 
completely obvious, and it is the main goal of this paper. 
  Let us examine a typical situation associated with operating 
a boxing system in correspondence with the objective posed 
above. Let us assume that a researcher must perform certain 
manipulations with infectious materials during his work using a 
boxing system. We know that an aerosol containing infectious 
material is formed as a result of various research operations, 
and that this aerosol may enter the laboratory's air 
environment with circulating air. In order to reduce the 
concentration of infectious material in aerosol form in the 
boxing system and prevent its escape into the room, both the 
boxing system and the laboratory are ventilated. The natural 
processes by which the concentration of infectious material 
decreases--owing to sedimentation and inactivation in response 
to various factors--should be kept in mind in this case. 
Possible infection of laboratory personnel is a stochastic--that 
is, probablistic--process. If we assume that particles of 
infectious material in the air environment of a laboratory 
follow a Poisson distribution, then the probability of uptake of 
a certain quantity (k) of particles by working personnel will be 
determined by the expression: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;

  where P--probability; C[.sub][/]--concentration of 
infectious material in the room, number of cells per 1 
m[.sup]3[/] (cells.m[.sup]-3[/]); Q--pulmonary ventilation 
volume, m[.sup]3[/].sec[.sup]-1[/]; II--infecting dose, 
cells; _t_--time, sec. 
  An expression for the probability of uptake of at least one 
particle of infectious material by working personnel may be 
obtained from equation (1): 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Naturally equation (2) will be valid for the case when no 
devices are used in the course of the research to protect the 
personnel (that is, the work is done without a boxing system). 
When a boxing system is used in research as a primary barrier, 
the probability of infection of working personnel will be 
significantly lower. Equation (2) would have to be modified for 
this case. This is associated primarily with the fact that a 
boxing system is a technical device, failure of which reduces 
its protective effectiveness during the failure interval. A term 
accounting for the probability of infection of personnel in the 
event of the boxing system's failure must be introduced into 
equation (2) in this connection. We can arrive at a general 
equation for the probability of infection of working personnel 
in this way: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  where _l_--intensity of infection of personnel when the 
boxing system works without failure, sec[.sup]-1[/], 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  _l_[.sub]O[/]--intensity of infection of personnel in the 
event of the boxing system's failure, sec[.sup]-1[/], 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  _l_--intensity of the boxing sytsem's failure, sec; 
C[.sub][/]--concentration of the infectious material in 
the room prior to the boxing system's failure, 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]; C[.sub]o[/]--concentration of 
infectious material in the room created as a result of the 
boxing system's failure, cells.m[.sup]-3[/]; t--time of 
boxing system's failure, sec; _t_--current time of work of the 
boxing system, sec. 
  Equation (3) is inconvenient for analysis in the form shown 
here, which is why it is suitable to simplify it. Because 
variables _l__t_, _l_[.sub]_s_[/]_t_ _l_[.sub]O[/]_t_ 
are 
less than unity, expanding the exponents into a series and 
limiting ourselves to just linear terms, we can arrive at a 
transformed expression for the probability of infection of 
personnel working with infectious material in a boxing system: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In the case where the permissible probability (risk) of 
infection of working personnel is known, equation (4) may be 
used to calculate infection intensity. The authors of [2] 
proposed a value of permissible infection risk equal to 
1.10[.sup]-5[/] per person (over the course of a year) on the 
basis of an analysis of the frequency of cases of infection in 
different laboratories and the risk of death of people 
(accidents) owing to various random natural and social factors. 
Basing ourselves on this value of infection risk, we can 
calculate the permissible intensity of infection 
(_l_[.sub]II[/]), which is 1.10[.sup]-8[/] 
hr[.sup]-1[/] (on the condition that on the average, 
personnel are in contact with infectious material on the order 
of 1,000 hours per year). The resulting infection risk value 
agrees with published data [7]. Thus, performing the 
corresponding substitutions and transformations, we can arrive 
at the following equation for the intensity of infection of 
working personnel: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Let us analyze this equation. In the case of trouble-free 
operation of the boxing system, the intensity of its failure 
_l_[.sub]_s_[/] is equal to zero, from which it follows that 
_l_=_l_[.sub]II[/]=1.10[.sup]-8[/]hr[.sup]-t[/]--that 
is, that the intensity of infection of working personnel when 
the boxing system operates trouble-free is equal to the 
permissible infection intensity. However, the intensity of 
failure of the boxing system is always greater than zero, and 
therefore the protective effectiveness of the boxing system must 
provide for a personnel infection intensity of less than 
1.10[.sup]-8[/] hr[.sup]-1[/]. In the theory of the 
reliability of technical systems, redundancy is introduced into 
these systems with the purpose of reducing the failure 
intensity. However, if we assume that the time of operation of a 
back-up fan is from 10-50 sec, a back-up ventilation system 
would not result in a significant decrease in _l_[.sub]_s_[/] 
During this time, a certain quantity of infectious material may 
be released into the laboratory room depending on the 
concentration of the infectious material in the boxing system 
and its infecting dose, which will cause infection of personnel. 
  The risk of infection of personnel may be reduced by 
decreasing the intensity of infection of personnel in the event 
of failure of the boxing system (_l_[.sub]O[/])--that is, by 
correctly (justifiably) selecting the type of boxing system. The 
value of _l_[.sub]O[/] depends on the concentration and form 
(infecting dose) of the infectious material, and therefore the 
optimum type of boxing system should be selected for particular 
operations with certain pathogenic microorganisms. Many years of 
experience of microbiological research are generalized in WHO 
recommendations to permit selection of the type of boxing system 
on the basis of information on the operations being conducted 
and the form of the investigated microorganism [3]. However, the 
boxing system characteristics presented in these recommendations 
are descriptive (for example, airtight boxing systems, boxing 
systems with laminar flow, etc.), and they do not contain 
quantitative characteristics necessary for substantiated design 
and operation of different classes of boxing systems. Equation 
(5) obtained above may be used to substantiate the principal 
technical requirements on particular types of boxing systems. 
  Let us assume as before that a researcher is performing 
various manipulations with infectious material in a boxing 
system, as a result of which infectious material spreads in 
aerosol form, including out into the laboratory room. The 
processes occurring here may be diagrammed, and they may be 
described by the following system of differential equations: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  where k[.sub]p[/]--atomization factor, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
C--concentration of the investigated sample, 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]; k'[.sub]o_s_[/], 
k[.sub]o_s_[/]--air exchange factor for the boxing system's 
ventilation system and the room, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
k[.sub]c[/]--sedimentation coefficient, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
k&Ngr;&EEgr;--inactivation coefficient, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
K[.sub]&Bgr;[/]--constant characterizing release of infectious 
material out of the box into the room, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
k[.sub]B;--constant characterizing transfer of infectious 
material from the room to the box, sec[.sup]-1[/][/]; 
C[.sub]_s_[/], C[.sub][/]--current concentrations of 
infectious material in the boxing system and in the room, 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Spread of Infectious Material Out of a Boxing System: 
  C[.sub]Q[/], C[.sub]_s_[/], 
C[.sub][/]--initial concentration of infectious material, 
and the concentration formed in the boxing system and room; 
k[.sub]p[/]--process of formation of aerosol out of the 
infectious material at a rate k[.sub]p[/]; 
k[.sub]c[/]--process of sedimentation of infectious material 
at a rate k[.sub]c[/]; k[.sub]&Ngr;&EEgr;[/]--process of 
inactivation of infectious material at a rate 
k[.sub]&Ngr;&EEgr;[/]; k'[.sub]o_s_[/], 
k[.sub]o_s_[/]--process of removal of infectious material by 
means of the ventilation system of the boxing system and the 
room at a rate k'[.sub]o_s_[/]k[.sub]o_s_[/]; 
k'[.sub]B'[/] k[.sub]B[/]--process of movement of 
infectious material out of the room and out of the boxing system. 
  This equation system may be solved in general form by 
numerical methods; however, we are practically interested in the 
stationary case, in which all processes are in equilibrium and 
dC[.sub]_s_[/]/d_r_=dC[.sub][/]/d_t_=0. Equating 
equation (6) to zero and performing a number of manipulations, 
we can obtain an expression for the steady-state concentrations 
of infectious material in the boxing system and in the room: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  We know that the protective effectiveness of class 1 and 2 
boxing systems is characterized by the protection factor 
k[.sub]3[/], which is determined experimentally as the ratio 
of the concentration of aerosol simulating infectious material 
in the boxing system to its concentration in the room [5]. The 
protection factor is not used with a class 3 boxing system 
because the sensitivity of methods for recording simulated 
aerosols is below the real protective effectiveness of a class 3 
boxing system. However, the obtained equation (7a) allows us to 
calculate the protection factor for any class of boxing system: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  It should be noted that two parameters are used in the 
calculations in equation (8) (k[.sub]&Bgr;[/] and 
k'[.sub]&Bgr;[/], which cannot be determined directly by 
experimental means. Both of these parameters may be calculated 
on the basis of the laws of aerodynamics. However, the formulas 
for the above parameters will differ in application to different 
classes of boxing systems due to the structural features of each 
class of boxing system. 
  Thus, class 1 and 2 boxing systems are exhaust systems with 
open access from the front panel. As a rule the protective 
effectiveness of such boxing systems is the product of the 
laminar nature of air flow in the opening in the boxing system 
provided for the operator, and restriction of the operator's 
access into the boxing system by reduction of the area of the 
opening. In this case transport of aerosol from the boxing 
system into the room is associated with turbulization of the air 
flow in the boundary layers of the opening, and with 
manipulations carried out with the operator's hands. A class 3 
boxing system is an airtight one in which access into its 
interior is achieved with hermetically attached gloves. In this 
case transport of infectious aerosol into the room would be 
possible due to its diffusion through existing leaks. 
  It should be noted that different types of boxing systems, 
including similar class 1, 2 and 3 boxing systems intended for 
microbiological research, are widely used today in research on 
toxic and radioactive substances. Theory permitting us to 
calculate protective effectiveness when working with these 
substances has been developed sufficiently well on the basis of 
the laws of aerodynamics for such boxing systems. Because 
calculation of parameters k[.sub]&Bgr;[/] and k'[.sub]&Bgr;[/] 
(coefficients characterizing transport of aerosol from the 
boxing system into the room and its return back into the boxing 
system) does not require knowledge of numerical characteristics 
inherent to microbiological aerosols, the formulas used to 
calculate them will also be valid for boxing systems intended 
for work with infectious material. The following formulas are 
presented in [4] for calculating coefficients k[.sub]&Bgr;[/] 
and k'[.sub]&Bgr;[/]: 
  for class 1 and 2 boxing systems: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  for class 3 boxing systems: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  where f--cross section of the opening (or leaks) in the 
boxing system, m[.sup]2[/]; v[.sub]m[/]--rate of air flow 
in the opening (or leaks), m.sec[.sup]-1[/]; a--thickness of 
the wall of the boxing system, m; A--coefficient of turbulent 
exchange, m[.sup]2[/].sec[.sup]-1[/]; D--diffusion 
coefficient, m[.sup]2[/].sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
V[.sub]_s_[/]--volume of the boxing system, m[.sup]3[/]; 
_D_p--drop in pressure in the boxing system in an airtightness 
test, kg.m[.sup]-2[/]; p[.sub]&EEgr;[/]--absolute pressure in 
the room, kg.m[.sup]-2[/]; t[.sub]p[/]--duration of 
airtightness test on boxing system, sec. 
  The entire complex of equations (5) and (8) may be used with 
regard for formulas (9-9c) to calculate the necessary protective 
effectiveness of different classes of boxing systems using a 
principal indicator such as the protection factor. 
  Let us first examine class 1 and 2 boxing systems. Work not 
leading to formation of a large quantity of aerosol may be 
carried out in boxing systems of this type in accordance with 
WHO recommendations. In addition work with infectious material 
of low pathogenicity is also recommended in such protective 
systems. The following boundary conditions may be adopted for 
this case: an average concentration in the boxing system of 
C[.sub]_s_[/]10 cells.m[.sup]-3[/] (typical of the 
following operations: preparing streak cultures in Petri dishes, 
placing a wire loop bearing inoculation material in a flame, 
pouring culture into test tubes, and so on [5], an infecting 
dose of II|G1.10[.sup]4[/] cells (typical of microorganisms 
evoking typhoid fever, cholera, anthrax and so on [5], a boxing 
system volume (V[.sub]_s_[/]) of 1 m[.sup]3[/] and room 
volume (V[.sub][/]) of 200 m[.sup]3[/] (a 6x8 m 
laboratory). In the event of failure of the boxing system's 
ventilation, it may be assumed that infectious material in 
aerosol form in the boxing system will spread uniformly 
throughout the entire room. Then the concentration of infectious 
material in aerosol form in the room may be calculated using the 
formula: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  and for the conditions presented above it will be 
5.10[.sup]-2[/] cells.m[.sup]-3[/]. Substituting the 
obtained value of C[.sub]II[/] in equations (5) and (8), we 
can determine the required protection factor of class 1 and 2 
boxing systems. It will be found to be equal to 
1.2.10[.sup]5[/]. What this value means physically is that 
when an aerosol concentration of, for example, on the order of 
1.10[.sup]5[/] cells.m[.sup]-3[/] is created in class 1 
and 2 boxing systems, the concentration of aerosol in the room 
will not exceed 1 cell.m[.sup]-3[/]. Next, using equation 
(9a), we can determine the rate of air flow that must be 
maintained in the opening of the boxing system in order to 
ensure the boxing system's required protection factor of 
1.2.10[.sup]5[/]. It will be equal to 0.7 
m.sec[.sup]-1[/]. The air flow rate obtained here by 
calculation confirms the numerous recommendations for this value 
contained in the literature [2,5]. Analysis of information in 
Soviet and foreign literature [6,8] shows that as a rule, class 
1 and 2 boxing systems that have presently been developed in 
different countries satisfy the requirements presented above, 
and consequently provide protection to personnel. 
  Let us examine class 3 boxing systems. Boxing systems of 
this 
type are intended for any laboratory operations with any 
pathogenic microorganisms. In this case we can assume the 
following boundary conditions: average concentration in the box 
(C[.sub]_s_[/]) on the order of 1.10[.sup]3[/] 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/] (the indicated concentration may arise in 
the following operations: centrifugation, vibration of a wire 
loop in the course of inoculation, and intranasal administration 
of infectious material to mice [5]) and an infecting dose (II) 
of one cell (typical for example of Marburg and Lassa viruses as 
well as of bacterial infections such as plague, tularemia and so 
on [5]). Substituting the adopted values into equations (5), (8) 
and (9a), we can come to the conclusion that a properly working 
class 3 boxing system provided guaranteed protection to 
personnel. In the event of failure of the ventilation system of 
a class 3 boxing system (the probability of failure 
_l_[.sub]_s_&gt; reset&gt;  is equal to 1.10[.sup]-4[/][/] 
hr[.sup]-1[/] [1]), an excess pressure in relation to the 
room may be created within it for a short time. The 
concentration of infectious material in the room created as a 
result of failure will depend wholly on the airtightness of the 
system, and it may be calculated by the equation: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  It was noted above that the intensity of infection of 
personnel in the case of trouble-free operation of a class 3 
boxing system is practically equal to zero. In this case an 
expression may be obtained from equations (5) and (10) by which 
to calculate the required airtightness of a class 3 boxing 
system: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Substituting the concentration of infectious material that 
could be created in a class 3 boxing system into formula (11), 
we can obtain the required leakage factor for the boxing system 
(for example, at an average concentration of 1.10[.sup]3[/] 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/] the leakage factor is 
1.44.10[.sup]-3[/] hr[.sup]-1[/]). Boxing systems intended 
for work with radioactive materials are often used today for 
work with infectious materials. According to the All-Union State 
Standard* they are ``airtight'' if the pressure drop 
accompanying an excess air pressure of not less than 1,000 Pa 
(100 kg.m[.sup]-2)[/] does not exceed 10 percent over a time 
interval of not less than 30 minutes. Substituting the indicated 
data into equation (9a), we can determine the leakage factor for 
both boxes, which is 1.9.10[.sup]-3[/] hr[.sup]-1[/]. We 
can also use equation (11) to calculate the permissible average 
concentration of infectious material in this type of boxing 
system, which will be 0.7.10[.sup]3[/] 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]--that is, for practical purposes the 
necessary protection is afforded to personnel by a boxing system 
of this type. 
  Thus a scientific methodological approach is presented here 
making it possible to substantiate the principal technical 
requirements on boxing systems in relation to different 
conditions of their use. The main thing is that design and 
operation of boxing systems must be directly interrelated with 
the actual conditions of their work, inasmuch as characteristics 
such as the system's reliability, the possible concentrations of 
infectious material in the aerosol formed when performing 
various research operations, the degree of danger of the 
material in question, and the permissible risk to personnel 
carrying out particular types of research must be accounted for.

  [Abstract] The discovery that the 
Ca[.sup]2+[/]-dependence plasmid is the necessary inversion 
genome element for imparting virulence prompted a study in which 
biologically active pCaD loci were cloned and their functions 
subsequently examined. In particular, the fifth HindIII fragment 
of PCaD and hybrid plasmids containing small functionally 
significant segments of this fragment are investigated. 
Altogether, a bank of HindIII, EcoRI, and PstI fragments of the 
Ca[.sup]2+[/]-dependence plasmid of Yersinia 
pestis, strain 358, is constructed, and restriction pCaD 
charts are plotted by means of restriction analysis using these 
fragments as probes. The findings demonstrate that the study of 
the mutation versions' expression of an intact pCaD plasmid or 
even its small fragments is probably not justified in some cases 
due to the complicated and little-known regulatory relationships 
among this plasmid's individual genes. An animal study also 
reveals that two subfragments of the fifth HindIII fragment are 
capable of ensuring the pathogenic and invasiveness properties 
of avirulent strains of Y. pestis, Y. 
pseudotuberculosis, and E. coli while the full 
nucleotide sequence does not exhibit such properties. The issue 
of the reasons for the absence of protective effect from 
immunization with E. coli strains pSM2[.sup]+[/] 
and pSM3[.sup]+[/] remains unclear. Figures 5; tables 2;

  [Abstract] It is reported that low concentrations of 
6-azacytidine (6-AC)--a synthetic analog of cytidine produced at 
the Molecular Biology and Genetic Institute at the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences--suppresses DNA-genome virus (particularly 
adenovirus) reproduction and in contrast to 5-AC, is not very 
toxic and is not a carcinogen; moreover, it displays anticancer 
activity. It is also noted that there are no published data on 
the antimicrobial action of 6-AC but only indirect observations 
attesting to such activity. To bridge this gap, data on the 
effect of 6-AC on the functioning of various mollicutes and the 
probable molecular mechanism of this effect are investigated. In 
so doing, Acholeplasma laidlawi PG-8 mollicutes from 
the family of Acholeplasmataceae and two other 
species--the Mycoplasma pneumoniae FH and 
Mycoplasma fermentans PG-18--from the family of 
Mycoplasmataceae were examined. All strains were 
obtained from Dr. Freundt (Denmark). The mollicutes were grown 
in the SM IMV-72 medium. The study demonstrates the inhibitory 
effect of 6-AC on mollicutes in various systematic positions; 
standard mollicute strains ceased growing completely in a 
nutrient medium at a 6-AC concentration of 125-250 g/ml. 
Different levels of inhibition at other 6-AC concentrations for 
various strains are summarized. Translation of mollicutes on 
ribosomes in vitro ceased completely at a 100 g/ml 
6-AC concentration, attesting that there may be two targets for 
6-AC in the mollicute cells and possibly other 
microorganisms--ribosomes and DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase. In 
the end, the blockage of translation and replication processes 
by 6-AC leads to the death of mollicutes, but since 6-AC has no 
mutagenic, carcinogenic, or cell differentiation-inducing effect 
on human cells, it may be used as an efficient means of treating 
respiratory (atypical pneumonia) and urogenital diseases induced 
by mollicutes; with respect to the role of mycoplasma in the 
development of AIDS, 6-AC may be used as a preventive measure, 
provided that proper drugs are developed and clinically tested. 
It is speculated that the mechanism of 6-AC effect on the 
mollicute growth is related to direct interference in the 
replication of genome DNA and blocking of the ribosome function.

  [Abstract] The urgency of intensifying biological waste 
water treatment methods, particularly by adding spent and 
partially mineralized sludge, in order to lower capital and 
operating outlays and the experience of biological sewage 
treatment at the Lisichansk Oil Refinery (LNPZ) where partially 
mineralized sludge is used as a biogenic additive are discussed, 
and it is noted that this method may be economically efficient 
for many other plants. The possibility of substituting ammophos 
used as a biogenic additive at many plants for stimulating the 
development of activated sludge microorganisms in aeration tanks 
by partially mineralized sludge from the sludge ground at the 
Lisichansk Oil Refinery is investigated; in so doing, the 
biological additives are balanced for various nitrogen and 
phosphorus concentrations whereby ammonium chloride is used as 
the principal nitrogen source. Activated sludge was incubated 
for 17 days in rocking test tubes. The study demonstrates the 
possibility of using spent sludge as a bioadditive for enhancing 
biocenosis of activated sludge; addition of partially 
mineralized sludge balanced for the above biological elements 
improves the biological treatment indicators relative to 
petroleum product removal and raises the number of 
microorganisms which destroy hydrocarbons. Even partial 
substitution of agents with spent sludge makes it possible to 
save mineral raw materials and move a step closer toward 
developing waste-free practices of enhancing biological waste 
water treatment while ammophos may be substituted with ammonium 
chloride, thus lowering waste water contamination with 
phosphorus. Tables 4; references 11: 9 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] The mechanism of bacterial neuston development 
on the air and water interface of reservoirs and the 
surface-active and hydrophobic layer on the water surface 
(10-100 m) is discussed, and it is noted that today, there 
are virtually no bacterial preparations which enhance the 
self-treatment process on the basis of neuston forms of 
microorganisms. An attempt is made to produce such preparations 
based on adaptive selection of neuston bacterial forms with an 
elevated cell surface hydrophobia and to examine the efficacy of 
using neuston forms of bacterial preparations for treating water 
by removing petroleum hydrocarbons and for biological 
decontaminating of waste water already treated by traditional 
methods. To this end, Bacillus megaterium 1BD, 
Pseudomonas putida BS-2, and Alcaligenes 
paradoxus BS-1 from the microorganism collection of the 
biosynthesis technology division of the Microbiology and 
Virology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences grown in 
test tubes in a rocker making 240 strokes per minute were used. 
The possibility of selecting neuston bacterial forms which 
concentrate on the water/atmosphere interface is demonstrated; 
the preparation on the basis of Bacillus megaterium 
is more effective in treating petroleum-based hydrocarbon 
contamination than the preparation on the basis of the plankton 
form of the same culture. The preparation developed on the basis 
of the neuston form of aerobic spore-forming bacteria is more 
effective in biological decontamination of waste water treated 
by traditional methods. The preparation was tested under 
full-scale conditions by treating a reservoir in the Sula river 
flood plain. The experiment shows that water treatment with the 
biological preparation for 48 h reduces the total microbial 
dissemination and makes it possible to get rid of staphylococci 
and Shigella. Thus, neuston forms of bacteria with antagonistic 
properties with respect to pathogenic microflora may probably be 
used for waste water decontamination and for improving the 
hygienic reservoir conditions. The use of neuston forms also 
makes it possible to enhance the microbiological processes in a 
15-40 m surface layer. Figures 3; tables 3; references 14:

  [Abstract] The broad range of human diseases caused by 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well various plant and 
animal ailments induced by numerous pathogenic factors in the 
pseudomonads, primarily enzymes with a toxic effect, and the 
resulting immunodeficiency prompted a study of the 
immunosuppressive action of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
extracts with respect to the cell immune response and an attempt 
to find the origin of the immunosuppressive factors. To this 
end, typical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains separated 
from the sputum of pneumonia patients (Nos. 140 and 3,990) and 
strains which had been cultivated for a long time in nutrient 
media under lab conditions (Nos. 1,961 and U-1) were examined. 
In so doing, the effect of water-phenol, trichloracetic, and 
salt extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the 
delayed hypersensitivity of mice to the guinea pig antigen is 
studied. The study reveals that the salt extracts of the wild 
strains contain thermostable immunosuppressive factors of a 
lipid origin with a high mass (over 800 kD) which may be 
inactivated by trichloracetic acid and phenol. On the other 
hand, salt extracts of museum strains as well as water and 
phenol trichloracetic extracts produced from wild and museum 
bacteria strains do not display immunosuppressive activity. It 
is speculated that these factors may be a pseudomonad 
lipopolysachharide component and that the biological properties 
of pseudomonads are not related to impairments of the 
oxygen-dependent processes in macrophages. Figures 2; tables 2;

<F P=106> [Article by Ju. Tubinis, ``Radioactive Container''] </F>
  [Text] A radioactive container was detected in the 
territory of the former Severnyy camp where first a Soviet, and 
later a Russian division had been headquartered for many years 
at the center of Vilnius. It is reported that the source is 
emitting 3,300 R/h. 
  It is not clear how it appeared there since after the 
transfer the territory was carefully examined by experts. Much 
has been written about the harm inflicted to Lithuania by the 
former Soviet Army, and each case of environmental damage is 
carefully documented. Lithuanian experts have long suspected 
that radioactive substances may remain in the territory of 
former military units, but even in the camps which house missile 
divisions, nothing has been found thus far. The problem mostly 
amounted to soil contamination with petroleum products. Here, 
the military units indeed ``worked hard.'' In some places, the 
soil was penetrated so deep that cleanup calls for enormous hard 
currency outlays. A lot of petroleum products penetrated the 
soil even in the territory of the Severnyy camp. This was 
established by environmental experts. Yet this contamination did 
not pose a serious problem for the future of this territory. The 
municipal administration has decided to set up the largest

  [Abstract] The shortcomings of the existing environmental 
pollution monitoring systems and the inadequacy of the data 
interpolation procedures whereby the contamination levels are 
assessed objectively only at the sampling spots prompted the 
development of new methodological approaches to identifying 
territories with different man-caused atmospheric air pollution 
levels on the basis of terrestrial monitoring and remote sensing 
data obtained from space using such revealing traits as dust and 
aerosol fraction discharges which accompany air pollution. The 
aerospace information is received from a regional center in the 
form of photographs taken simultaneously within three spectral 
bands (0.8-0.9, 0.6-0.7, and 0.5-0.6 m) by a Kosmos 
satellite 
with a medium resolution multispectral scanner. The pictures are 
digitized at 256 brightness level and subsequently processed as 
numerical matrices. The conclusion is drawn that the optical 
contrast level of aerial and space video images of the territory 
correlates with the atmospheric contamination index (IZA) thus 
reflecting the man-caused air pollution and making it possible 
to use it as the atmospheric purity criterion. The principal 
advantages of the method are the reliability, data 
representation form, and the possibility of identifying the 
pollution source within the abnormal optical contrast zone as 
well as the convenience of assessing the pollution dynamics by 
comparing the pictures taken within a certain period, thus 
obviating systematic ground-level monitoring in order to 
determine the toxic substance concentration and analyze the 
near-surface concentration fields. Figures 4; references 8.

  [Abstract] The harmful consequences of the uncontrolled use 
of chemical plant protection agents which led to cases of 
agricultural worker poisoning prompted a study of soil and water 
samples taken at the Khramtsovskiy state farm in Beloyarsk rayon 
of Sverdlovsk oblast in June 1990 after several cases of 
poisoning were reported. Samples were taken near the area of 
suspected use or storage of chemicals and well as water from 
puddles and ponds near the fields. The samples were analyzed for 
the concentration of such organic pollutants as chlorophenols, 
polycyclical aromatic hydrocarbons (PAU), and pesticides by 
using a combination of gas-liquid chromatography (GZhKh) and 
mass spectrometry (MS). To this end, 50 g samples were mixed 
with 200 ml of 50% aqueous acetone and filtered, after 
which 
the residue was extracted in 100 ml of the same mixture, while 
the extract was reduced by evaporation. Total ion current (PIT) 
mass spectrograms of the water extract from a puddle near carrot 
and other fields and mass spectrograms with various retention 
times are plotted. The findings demonstrate that various toxic 
substances are found in the samples taken near the poisoning 
locations, especially near pesticide storage facilities, but in 
most cases, no abnormally high concentrations of residual 
amounts exceeding the maximum permissible concentration were 
detected except for one sample. The data are not sufficient for 
a complete statistical estimate of the total field contamination 
and for pinpointing the specific cause yet point toward the 
presence of individual localized contamination of the territory 
with possible harmful impacts on agricultural workers. Figures

  [Abstract] The findings of a study of the effect of air 
pollution on the population morbidity in Zaporozhye carried out 
between 1982 and 1990 whereby two observation zones were 
selected in the city pursuant to the instruction and 
methodological directives approved by the USSR Public Health 
Ministry are presented. Each zone--one ``dirty'' and one 
conditionally clean (Ordzhonikidze borough and Khorti 
neighborhood)--house a city weather forecast station. The former 
is located 2-3 km from an industrial area while the latter--at a 
10 km distance. Morbidity data are classified by the frequency 
of aid requests and are obtained from current files maintained 
by treatment and preventive care facilities covering both 
children and adults. The findings are backed by a sound 
statistical correlation and are consistent with the results 
produced by the laboratory of genetic research at the Republican 
Scientific Hygienic Center at the Ukrainian Ministry of Public 
Health. For children, morbidity in the dirty zone is higher than 
that in the clean zone by 3.51 times for blood diseases, 1.81 
times for eye diseases, and 1.79 times for upper respiratory 
tract disorders while the combined morbidity is 1.6 times higher 
than in the clean zone, 1.45 times higher than in the rest of 
the republic, and 1.39 higher than the USSR average. Upper 
respiratory tract disorders have the highest incidence 
(75-87%). The findings served as the basis for developing 
and 
implementing the Biosfera comprehensive target-oriented program 
for improving the environmental conditions in Zaporozhye.

  [Text] Concentration dynamics of petroleum products, 
phenols and surface active substances (SAS) in the Dnipro river 
was investigated during several years. The determinations were 
carried out in the region of Orsha, Mogilev and Rechitsa 
townships above and below the population points. It was shown 
that the water content of petroleum products and phenols 
exceeded the maximum permissible concentration. In respect to 
petroleum products, the most contaminated river segment was in 
the vicinity of Orsha. The phenol content in water was higher 
downstream from Orsha and Mogilev. It was noted that during the 
past years the concentration of SAS in the Dnipro river water 
increased in the vicinity of Orsha and Mogilev. Figure 1;

<F P=106> [Article by Ilona Yegiazarova ``Intelligent dolphins are </F>
becoming working class'' under the rubric of ``Bordering on 
science fiction''] 
  [Text] ``We shall not mention the last names,'' I was 
immediately warned by my interviewees, scientists from the 
Moscow State University, who for a long time have carried out 
experiments at a Black Sea naval base. 
  ``Secrecy?..'' 
  ``No, this is not important. We are talking about a 
principally new effort. And in our peer group, it is not 
customary to stick your head out until the research findings are 
published in specialized publications. Yet the circumstances 
obligate us to make this known today. The hard reality is 
merciful both towards us and towards the dolphins.'' 
  Yet nevertheless, I decided to start with secrets. 
Especially 
since the subject is so exciting. The colleagues know: until 
recently, journalists weren't allowed anywhere near the dolphin 
aquariums related to the Navy in one way or another. And almost 
all of them had such a relationship. This engendered numerous 
rumors, including some about the dolphins' supernatural 
abilities. People use to say seriously that they were being used 
as live mines. 
  ``Even today, you will not be met at the installation with 
outstretched arms,'' according to the scientists. But this can 
be explained by the secrecy of the installation itself and not 
by the experiments with dolphins.`` Yes, they were used by the 
military. But certainly not for aggressive purposes. In essence, 
dolphins served as ``border guards''--they guarded a certain 
water area. Naturally, they do not have any supernatural 
abilities, but their intellect is highly developed. This enabled 
them to detect invasion by unwanted visitors. And notify us 
about it.'' 
  I continued to press: ``I also heard that dolphins were 
stuffed with chemical preparations, that electrodes were 
embedded into their brain, that dolphins were turned into 
obedient robots.'' 
  ``Of course not,'' the scientists respond with a smile. ``In 
principle, it is possible to affect the behavior of higher 
animals. Yet we were not interested in it. We and the dolphins 
are friends. And they are clever and understand everything...'' 
  ``Only that they cannot talk.'' 
  ``Yes, they can, in their own way.'' 
  For many people, all dolphins ``look the same,'' just like 
the Chinese look to the Europeans. Yet the experts never mistake 
any of their pupils for others. They also state that they are 
just as different as you and I. They even have their own 
character. Some of them are stubborn, some witty, some gay, some 
pensive. Sometimes they want to joke. Take, for example, 
beautiful Buran (see figure [not reproduced]); he likes to hide 
in a secluded place, and when he sees a human nearby, he will 
throw a jellyfish at him. And in so doing, the misbehaving 
dolphin tries to hit you straight in the face. His friend Ritm 
would sometimes play dead--lie on the swimming pool bottom and 
wait until the worried staff dive and look for him, then he 
would suddenly ``come back to life'' to everybody's joy. 
  Yet jokes do not get in the way of business. When the time 
comes to get to serious work, dolphins display enviable 
diligence. When asked the question ``Where is the 10x12 
wrench?'' they will not start arguing like in a well-known joke, 
but will quickly bring the tool. And this is how dolphins can be 
tremendously useful to humans. To tell the truth, this has not 
been fully comprehended by people. 
  In essence, scientists from the Moscow State University 
taught dolphins to find and help to lift any sunken equipment 
from the bottom. And people sink a lot of things: when laying 
pipelines and during underwater petroleum exploration, and 
during various types of repairs. Unfortunately, they are sinking 
the most valuable items and, as a rule, ``without any trace.'' 
They do not even send divers: it is exceedingly difficult to 
find the lost items. At times, the diving station is not 
working, sometimes it is too deep, the water is turbid, or there 
is not enough time. Yet this does not pose difficulty for 
dolphins. This has been proven by many years of experiments in 
the Black Sea. 
  ``How do you explain to the dolphins what it is exactly you 
are trying to find?'' I asked. With dogs, e.g., you let them 
sniff something before sending them to search. And then you say 
``Search!'' 
  ``The details of our relations' with dolphins are our 
know-how. But take my word for it: dolphins can generalize what 
they can see. They primarily respond to the items which are 
distinguished from the natural background. Then they accomplish 
more specific tasks.'' 
  ``And can they find lost treasures?'' 
  ``During the time of research using dolphins, we found and 
lifted from the bottom more than a ton of silver, amorphous, and 
other archeological wonders. You should agree that in addition 
to the scientific aspect, it is also very interesting from the 
economic viewpoint. 
  I suddenly got an idea: ``And why haven't we used dolphins 
to 
look for the Loch Ness monster?'' '' 
  ``No problem,'' the scientists respond. ``As long as the 
monster is there. Dolphins are capable of staying in fresh water 
for a certain time without any harm to their health. Let them 
search. For certainty, we can also attach television cameras to 
them--we have also tried that too.'' 
  ``Of course, these are exotic things. But if you are 
serious, 
there would be a lot of work for dolphins at oil and gas fields. 
And today, there are more and more of them further up North...'' 
  ``I understand. Would the dolphins freeze? No. They can dive 
very deep and they are well protected from hypothermia by a fat 
layer under their skin. Moreover, it is easy to train northern 
dolphins--the belugas.'' 
  Thus, Russian scientists have developed a unique training 
program--this is how we can tentatively refer to this process 
whereby any wild dolphin is turned in a nine-month period into 
an animal devoted to humans and capable of executing the most 
complicated tasks to find anything, even drowned persons. Their 
loyalty is so strong that when working in the open sea, the 
dolphins always return. No matter how they are being lured by 
their idol kin. This is a serious accomplishment on a world 
level. American forecasters thought that such problems could not 
be solved before 2020. There are other plans at the Moscow State 
University. They think there, in the form of a hypothesis at 
present, that it will be possible to work equally as 
successfully with other less ``intelligent'' animals. For 
example, with bats. We could certainly use their mastery of 
ultrasound. But... 
  The readers are probably already getting an idea that I will 
have to finish this report in a rather uneventful fashion. 
Research by the Moscow State University biologists is no longer 
being financed--the money has long run out. Both for salaries 
and for experiments. And the enthusiasm is running out too. It 
seems that no one cares about our lead. And about the fact that 
we proposed a method of underwater search which requires almost 
no physical expenditures and is environmentally clean and safe. 
  Dear businessman, you should really help the scientists. And 
you, oil and gas field workers, should pay careful attention. 
And give more help. And maybe, the government will also take an 
interest? It is worth it. 
  The scientists sigh ``the problem, alas, is not simply in 
our 
salary or lost profit; we are embarrassed in front of our 
dolphin friends. We have no food to give to them...'' 
  In the figure [not reproduced]: Buran is smiling and asking 
for food.

  [Abstract] One modern technique for assessing the degree of 
expression of a pathological process in the body, severity of 
state, and efficacy of therapy is the determination of the 
functional state of the neutrophil leukocytes, specifically, 
from their ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (the NBT 
test). Elevated values in the NBT test indicates, in most cases, 
the presence of a bacterial infection. Neutrophil activity is 
stimulated by latex or bacterial antigens to clarify the reserve 
capabilities of the neutrophil. In earlier work, the researchers 
studied the spontaneous NBT test in full-blown leptospirosis, 
identifying a considerable elevation of mean NBT-test values. 
Some patients, however, produced values that were below normal. 
In the work reported here, the researchers observed 148 
individuals with icterohemorrhagic leptospirosis in order to 
study the possibility of using the NBT test to predict the 
severity of the course of the disease and the probability of the 
development of complications. The indices for the spontaneous 
NBT test and the staphylococcus- stimulated NBT test were, in 
fact, found to be a function of severity of course and 
developing complications. Elevated values for the spontaneous 
NBT test were typical of a mild or medium severity or for a 
severe, but uncomplicated case. In patients with a severe form 
of the disease, but low spontaneous NBT-test values, the absence 
of staphylococcus stimulation served as a predictor of the 
development of life-threatening complications. Leptospirosis 
vaccine depressed NBT-test levels. Persistence of the depressive 
effect in convalescents indicated a high probability of the 
development of late complications. Figures 1, references 10: 7

  [Abstract] Reports of selective injury to CD4+ cells by 
HIV-1 (VICh) cells and the lack of selectivity in known AIDS 
treatment approaches which cannot ensure oriented removal of 
only infected mononuclear cells from the blood prompted an 
in vitro investigation into the possibility of 
selective binding of cells expressing HIV proteins from the 
infected culture with the help of immunosorbents. The C-3 silica 
gel with a mean radius of 48 A and a 200-250 m mean grain 
size made in Gorkiy is used as the matrix, and the 
immunoglobulin fraction of the AIDS patient serum containing 
high titres of specific antibodies (1:3,000 in the indirect 
immunofluorescence reaction) is used as the ligand. The sorption 
binding of monocyte EVK/IRA/3 culture cells chronically infected 
with HIV-1 is summarized. Two approaches are used in the study: 
immobilization of antibodies to viral proteins expressed on the 
surface of affected cells on a rigid matrix and the use of 
nonspecific interactions of the model system cells with the 
sorbent cells. It is noted that no attempt was made to develop a 
superselective sorbent (selectivity is defined here as 
predominant sorption of HIV-infected cells compared to intact 
model system cells). The findings make it possible to speculate 
that one can develop a selective sorbent for predominant binding 
of HIV-infected cells by using an inert material, e.g., 
sepharose, as the matrix, and confirm the feasibility of 
immunosorption binding of cells expressing HIV proteins. The 
approach aimed at removing HIV proteins, intact virions, and 
circulating immune complexes from the blood or plasma with the 
help of immunosorbents is recognized as promising while the use 
of immunosorbents synthesized in vivo is thought to 
be debatable. The immunosorbents demonstrate a selectivity rate 
of 92% vs. 29% for the control group. Tables 1;

  [Abstract] Dietary intake of the [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/] 

Sr radionuclides was evaluated on the basis of 
data which characterize the actual contamination of the 
foodstuff samples from ten inhabited localities in Gomel oblast 
and in Gomel and the prepared products sold to the population 
through the retail and public food service outlets. The dietary 
structure of the population determined by studying the family 
budgets carried out by the Gomel oblast statistical 
administration in 1985-1987 was used in analyses. The mean [.sup]137[/] 

Cs concentration in the food sold to the 
population by retail and public food service outlets in Gomel 
oblast, in Ci/kg, the structure of the diet used in computing 
the [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr dietary intake, the 
average daily [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake with 
basic foodstuffs in individual rayons of Gomel oblast in 
1986-1989, the likely mean levels of daily dietary [.sup]137[/] 
Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake (ignoring 
rejects), the actual mean levels of daily dietary [.sup]137[/] 
Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake (allowing for 
rejects), and the [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr daily 
dietary intake of the population living in an area with a unit 
contamination density are summarized. The findings show that the 
food contamination levels decrease gradually with time (after 
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident). In particular, the [.sup]137 
[/] 
Cs intake decreased by threefold from 1986 to 
1989. A rayon-by-rayon analysis reveals that Narovlyansk rayon 
which used to be the most contaminated with cesium is now in 
second place (a 206 to 60 10[.sup]-10[/] Ci/day drop) while 
in Vetkovsk rayon, the [.sup]137[/]Cs level dropped from 185 
to 62. Tables 6.

<F P=106> [Interview with prof, Dr Med Sci Anatoliy Aleksandrovich </F>
Ilin, by correspondent S. Lokteva; place and date of interview 
not given: ``Biolakt With an Emblem of Quality''] 
  [Text] What pediatrician doesn't know today what 
Biolakt is? This baby food product has long been popular among 
both physicians and mothers. But its recognition at the state 
level occurred only today. The results of 30 years of work were 
finally noted, and a group of Kyrgyz scientists was awarded the 
republic's 1992 State Prize in science and engineering on the 
anniversary of the Kyrgyz Republic's establishment ``for 
creating children's dairy products of high biological value, for 
developing the production process, for their production and 
introduction into public health practice.'' 
  Today we talk with one of the recipients of the 
prize--professor, Doctor of Medical Sciences Anatoliy 
Aleksandrovich Ilin. 
  [Lokteva] To begin, in behalf of the newspaper I 
would like to congratulate you and your fellow workers--P. 
Fedorov, D. Kudayarov, V. Babich, V. Pavlinov, A. Knyazev, K. 
Sarzhanov and M. Kadyrov--on earning the award. And second, it 
would be interesting to hear from you that there is room for 
creative work in our long-suffering land. 
  [Ilin] Of course. The health of children, after 
all, is a special problem. It is directly associated with the 
society's standard of living. Unfortunately over 1 million 
children being born today in all of the former USSR are being 
raised on formula. The number of women experiencing insufficient 
lactation is increasing. There are also those who are unable to 
lactate at all. Therefore providing children with complete 
nutrition is an important social task. As for us, the medical 
scientists, our specific task in science is to make children's 
dairy formulas as close as possible in their biological 
indicators to mother's milk. This problem was in fact the 
initial motivation for creating the product we are discussing 
here. 
  [Lokteva] Let's remind the readers what Biolakt is. 
  [Ilin] A cultured milk product made from specially 
selected physiological strains of lactic acid bacteria 
possessing pronounced antibacterial and proteolytic properties, 
and low acidity. Proteins, fats and carbohydrates in milk are 
broken down in the course of the vital activities of these 
bacteria. Vitamins, enzymes, antibacterial substances and free 
amino acids accumulate in the food product. It is the presence 
of such an intricate complex of biologically active substance 
that raises the food value of Biolakt, and makes it resemble 
mother's milk. The product has a positive effect on nonspecific 
and specific immunity, and it normalizes gastrointestinal 
activity. Biolakt is also recommend for children over 1 year 
old, and as a therapeutic diet for patients with intestinal 
infections. It can be used for therapeutic purposes in the 
presence of gastritis, gastric ulcers, colitis and 
hepatocholecystitis. 
  [Lokteva] As I understand it, studies were 
conducted on Biolakt with the purpose of enriching it with 
vitamins and microelements lacking in mother's milk. 
  [Ilin]Yes, the choice of microelement compounds 
was important in this sense as well. Readily dissociating 
compounds were the most suitable from our point of view. 
Enriching the cultured milk product with lysozyme, which not 
only preserves mother's milk but is also compatible in 
qualitative composition with microflora of the child's 
intestine, is also useful. 
  [Lokteva]Are different varieties of Biolakt now 
being produced in this connection? 
  [Ilin]We have developed four varieties of the 
product. Adapted Biolakt and adapted Biolakt with lysozyme, 
intended for children in the first months of life; they are 
especially recommended for children who are weak and often sick. 
Plain Biolakt and enriched Biolakt are products for children in 
the second half-year of life. And in general, Biolakt products 
have therapeutic and preventive value when given to sick 
children over 1 year old. Especially when anemia, 
gastrointestinal and septic diseases, dysbacteriosis and lactase 
deficiency are present. 
  [Lokteva]Let's get back to the prize. Were you 
able to earn it just by doing scientific research? 
  [Ilin]Not only that. The most important thing 
was that we developed the technical conditions and parameters of 
producing the cultured milk product. For example we were able to 
establish that when copper sulfate and ascorbic acid are added 
to the solution simultaneously, the concentration of the latter 
in the food product decreases by 30 percent. On the other hand, 
were these substances to be added separately, after chelation of 
the copper with protein, vitamin C would be retained completely 
in the product. This is not to mention the fact that production 
factors affect the energy of acid formation, the mucus-forming 
ability of lactic acid bacteria, their reproduction, and 
antibiotic and proteolytic capacity. 
  [Lokteva]Was it these technological developments 
that permitted you to organize production? 
  [Ilin]All four varieties of Biolakt are now 
being produced in all cities and rayons of Kyrgyzstan, as well 
as 12 countries of the former USSR. But most importantly, a 
biological factory for industrial production of bacterial leaven 
used to make Biolakt in dairy shops, dairy kitchens and in the 
home has begun operating in Bishkek. Mass production of Biolakt 
will make it possible to reduce the shortage of baby foods at 
all levels. The cultured milk product can now be available to 
practically every mother in dry form. When necessary, it would 
be enough to transform the dry leaven into liquid form, 
according to the instructions of course, and then mix the latter 
with milk, after which this fabulous baby food is ready. 
  Today. the Bishkek biological factory, which has an easily 
remembered address--Chuy Prospekt, 304--can satisfy the demand 
of youngsters in all of the former Union. I am announcing this 
to you officially.

  [Abstract] The importance of sound and balanced nutrition, 
especially under exposure to radionuclides which lower body 
resistance, prompted a hygienic evaluation of the actual 
nutrition at child care institutions and the necessary 
corrective measures related to the type of food. To this end, 
the actual nutrition was examined in the Plavsk rayon of Tula 
oblast in the framework of the 1990-1992 State Union-Republican 
Program of Urgent Measures in the aftermath of the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant accident. A contingent of children was 
divided into two groups of 1-3 and 4-6 year old kids enrolled in 
a preschool institution. The preschool institution nutrition was 
examined by analyzing 100 menus using an analytical method with 
the help of tables. The characteristics of child nutrition 
rations based on the food intake (M+/-m) for 
proteins, fats, carbohydrates, caloric value, and protein:fat 
(animal vs. vegetable) ratio and the characteristics of daily 
rations of actual child nutrition for the content of principal 
nutrients and energy are summarized. This comprehensive hygienic 
assessment shows a lack of balance and a vitamin and mineral 
(especially calcium and iodine) deficiency. Based on the 
findings, balanced seven-day four-times-a-day rations for 1-3 
and 4-6 year olds are specially developed for the areas affected 
by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. Tables 2; 
references 8.

  [Abstract] The large quantity of raw materials and ready 
products which enter the atmosphere in the form of dust and 
vapors during the manufacturing of drugs and their likely toxic 
effect on humans prompted the development of stringent exposure 
guidelines (OBUV) and necessitated regular monitoring of their 
concentration in the air near pharmaceutical industry 
enterprises. In particular, a method of determining the 
concentration of methyl ether of chloracetic acid--a colorless 
volatile flammable liquid with an irritating smell which is 
easily soluble in ethanol and ether--in the atmospheric air 
against the background of associated biologically active 
substances is developed. The detection method is based on using 
gas-liquid chromatography with a flame ionization detector 
whereby samples are taken with activated BAU carbon for 
subsequent thermal destruction and conversion to methyl 
chloride. The sampling and sample analysis procedures are 
outlined, and a chromatogram of the harmful substance separation 
in the air is plotted. The procedure has a detection threshold 
of 0.001 g per 2 ml and and a lower measurement limit of 
0.0015 mg/m[.sup]3[/] (in a 20 l sample). The measured 
concentration range is 0.0015-0.2 mg/m[.sup]3[/] with a 
measurement error of +/-17.5%. The procedure has been 
tested at 
industry enterprises and approved by the USSR Public Health 
Ministry. Figures 2.

  [Abstract] The advantages and characteristic features of 
the use of biotesting for assessing the water quality are 
outlined, and the concept of hygienic significance which denotes 
toxicity to humans is introduced. For illustration, the effect 
of imported pesticides on Daphnia magna is 
investigated using draft GOST guidelines. The GOST approach is 
compared to the EPA and other procedures, and the acute toxic 
effect of the Maveric pesticide on Daphnia magna is 
summarized. The differences in the methods under study are 
discussed. The comparative analysis makes it possible to 
speculate that the methodological approaches to water quality 
assessment with the help of biotesting need further improvement 
but the findings are still insufficient for drawing definitive 
conclusions about the role of biotesting within the system of 
standard sanitary water quality control. Tables 1; references 7:

  [Abstract] The finding that intensification of free radical 
oxidation in tissues is the principal damage mechanism in the 
effect of ionizing radiation on the organism prompted an 
investigation into the status of the enzymatic antioxidant 
protection system in the organism of rats exposed to radioactive 
contamination for a long time. To this end, 28 male Vistar rats 
exposed to an external background radiation of 4 mR/h in Khoynik 
rayon of Gomel oblast for one month and 28 animals exposed to an 
external background radiation of 0.4 mR/h in Rechitsy rayon of 
Gomel oblast for five months are examined. The rats received an 
equivalent internal and external doses of 0.0141 and 2.52 rem, 
respectively, in the first group and 0.0021 and 1.44 rem in the 
second. The control group was exposed to an external background 
of 0.011-0.014 mR/h at the Minsk Medical School. The enzymatic 
antioxidant protection system indicators and the concentration 
of the lipid peroxidation products were compared to those of the 
control group. The experimental procedure is outlined. The 
reduced glutathion concentration and the glutathion peroxidase 
concentration in the liver and erythrocytes in group 2 rats are 
summarized. The study shows a marked increase in the lipid 
peroxidation product content in the irradiated animals; the 
superoxide dismutase activity in the animals exposed to a lower 
irradiation dose was much higher than that in the control group, 
attesting to stressed compensatory mechanisms which usually 
neutralize free oxygen radicals forming under the effect of 
ionizing radiation. Tables 1; references 7: 4 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] The decisive role played by carotenes and 
vitamins E, C, and A in enabling the tissues to resist the 
development of radiation-induced free radical damage prompted a 
study of the concentration of vitamins E and A and ubiquinone, 
ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and diketogulonic acids, 
_b_-carotenes, lipid peroxidation products, dien conjugates, 
and 
malonic dialdehyde in blood and plasma and liver mitochondria of 
28 rats kept for five months at permanent monitoring stations 
(reference points) in Rechitsy rayon of Gomel oblast. The 
radioactive cesium concentration at these points was 
1.041+/-0.043 kBq/kg, and the animal nutrition ration consisted 
mostly of cereals (oats) with a specific radioactivity of 0.28 
kBq/kg for cesium. The ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and 
diketogulonic acid concentration in the blood plasma and liver 
of rats kept in the radioactive contamination zone (group 1), 
the _b_-carotene and antioxidant vitamin concentration 
(ascorbic, dehydroascorbic, and diketogulonic acid and vitamins 
E and A) in the rat liver (groups 2 and 3), and the 
concentration of the lipid peroxidation products in the blood 
plasma and liver mitochondria of the test animals are 
summarized. All indicators were measured in group 1 (seven rats) 
immediately after the rats returned from the exposure zone; the 
remaining two groups were switched to the vivarium ration; one 
half (group 2) was injected with the antioxidant vitamin complex 
ten times on alternating days; the remaining 10 rats (group 3) 
received no treatment. The findings show that the ascorbic acid 
concentration in the blood plasma and especially liver in group 
1 is depressed while vitamin E concentration in group one was 
lower than that of the control group by more than twofold. The 
hypovitaminosis state was corrected by the AK preparation--an 
antioxidant complex of vitamins E, A, and C. This corrective 
action not only normalizes the _b_-carotene, tocopherol, 
ascorbate, and retinol levels in the blood and liver of test 
animals but also lowers the rate of the free radical oxidation 
processes by decreasing the peroxidation product concentration, 
thus helping to increase the animals' radiological resistance.

  [Abstract] The hemodynamics of 108 children aged 6-14 (87 
boys and 21 girls) with acute and chronic pyelonephritis--the 
most frequent urinary system disease in children with a tendency 
toward persistent relapses whose principal pathogenetic 
mechanisms are related to infection, chronic intoxication, and 
other factors aggravated by the unfavorable consequences of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident--including 76 kids from 
the regions contaminated with radionuclides are examined. In 
particular, the characteristic features of hemodynamics in 
children permanently residing in the contaminated rayons of 
Gomel and Mogilev oblasts are investigated. Tentative data on 
the radiation burden were based on the information about the 
radionuclide contamination of the territory obtained by the 
sanitary-epidemiological station, _g_-background indicators, 
and 
the results of medical examinations. A higher incidence of 
hypotension in children living in the regions with a 
considerable level of contamination with a predominance of 
hyperkinetic hemodynamics are recorded, especially at 
considerable [.sup]137[/]Cs contamination levels of 5-15 
Ci/km[.sup]2[/], and a higher incidence of 
hypersympathicotonia and sympathicotonia are identified. A 
hemodynamics analysis reveals no statistically significant 
differences in the arterial pressure indicators in the groups 
under study but a significant increase in the volumetric rate 
indicators of blood expulsion by the left ventricle and cardiac 
index in children with the disease vs. healthy kids. Yet thee 
indicators turned out to have no statistical correlation with 
the contamination level. The findings indicate a considerable 
disruption of vegetative regulatory activity of the 
cardiovascular system. Figures 1; tables 1; references 5.

  [Abstract] Reports about the possibility of preventing 
stress-related myocardial injury and cardiac rhythm disruptions 
in acute myocardial ischemia (OIM) by preliminary adaptation 
with the help of short mobilizations, brief hypoxia, and 
physical stress and enkephalin's known ability substantially to 
affect the vegetative myocardial innervation, making it possible 
to speculate that cyclical nucleotides play a role in realizing 
antiarrhythmic effects of opioid peptides (OP), prompted an 
evaluation of the possibility that cardial enkephalins may 
participate in the mechanisms of preventing arrhythmia in 
adapted animals. The experiment to study antiarrhythmic 
adaptation effect was carried out on 60 200-250 g Vistar male 
rats which were divided into four groups: intact, adapted to 
cold, adapted to physical stress through swimming, and adapted 
to the combined effect of cold and physical stress. The 
experimental procedure is outlined. The experiment shows that at 
a -11C temperature, animals not adapted to cold die after 
5-7 h while the adapted ones survive for at least 16 h. The 
adapted animals also had 1.5 times more fat. The animals not 
adapted to physical stress swim with a load of 10% of 
their 
body mass for no more than 10 min while the adapted animals swim 
for at least 25 min. Adaptation to combined physical stress and 
cold facilitated a reliable twofold decrease in mortality in 
subsequent acute myocardial ischemia and a decrease in the 
ventricular fibrillation rate and duration. The effect of 
adaptation and acute myocardial ischemia on the enkephalin 
concentration in the myocardium and the effect of adaptation and 
acute myocardial ischemia on the cyclical nucleotide 
concentration in the myocardium (M+/-m) is 
summarized. The findings demonstrate that adaptation to the 
combined exposure to cold and physical stress is the most 
effective in developing the endogenic opioid system stimulation 
and preventing arrhythmia in acute myocardial ischemia as well 
as lowering the experimental animal mortality. The study also 
reveals that intravenous administration of dalargin (enkephalin) 
before the coronary occlusion inhibits an increase in the cAMP 
concentration induced by acute myocardial ischemia, probably due 
to activating presynaptic opiate receptors. A limitation of the 
adrenergic effect on the myocardium in acute myocardial ischemia 
facilitates a decrease in the rate of cardiac arrhythmia. The 
findings attest to the fact that endogenic cardial enkephalins 
may play a significant role in the mechanism of antiarrhythmic 
effect of adaptation in acute myocardial ischemia; this effect 
is attributed to a decrease in the adrenergic influence on the 
heart and serves as an indirect evidence of a decrease in the 
sympathetic effect of the peptide on the heart. Tables 2;

  [Abstract] The difficulty of correcting stable motor 
function disorders due to the central motor system impairment of 
varying origin and the scarcity of data on the pathogenic 
mechanisms of these disorders prompted an extended research 
effort aimed at establishing the molecular-chemical mechanisms 
which underlie the so-called pyramid syndrome conducted at the 
Physiology Department of the I.P. Pavlov Institute. It 
established the specific neurohumoral factors capable, if 
injected to intact animals, of inducing motor disorders similar 
to those of the donor. There factors became known that the 
postural asymmetry factors (FPA) present in the cerebrospinal 
fluid (TsSZh). Special studies reveal that the postural 
asymmetry factor activity is blocked by a high-molecular peptide 
factor referred to as the inactivation factor (FI). The role of 
the specific brain peptide factors in the pathogenesis of, and 
compensation for, neurological disorders and the outlook for 
using them in the nervous disease treatment are investigated, 
and a new method is proposed on the basis of the experimental 
and theoretical work of Institute personnel (which have been 
issued patent No. 365 on 11 May 89 by the State Committee on 
Inventions and Discoveries). The method is based on using the 
donor liquor from patients who have convalesced well. To this 
end, the clinical effectiveness of the proposed method was 
examined using a contingent of patients with rather severe 
disorders; the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with a good 
recovery history was used as the donor liquor. The conclusion is 
drawn that liquor therapy is a promising treatment method for 
some disorders and that the hypothesis that the ligands search 
for the liquor of own receptors can be confirmed. It is noted 
that basic research into the molecular-chemical mechanisms of 
pathogenetic and compensatory brain processes make it possible 
not only to widen the scope of theoretical notions in the field 
of neuropathology but also to use them effectively in clinical 
practices. Tables 1; references 15.

  [Abstract] The emergence of low-power medical lasers and 
the resulting uses of such lasers on biological tissues as well 
reports that the use of noncoherent light sources and lasers in 
clinical practices leads to virtually indistinguishable results 
prompted renewed interest in developing light treatment devices 
using polymer optical fibers, especially since in most cases, 
the clinics do not have the facilities for retuning the laser 
radiation wavelength to match its spectrum with the resonant 
absorption lines of biologically significant molecules. The 
optical fiber will be able not only to transmit radiation 
bounded by the fiber end aperture but also the light generated 
by photoluminescence of the impurities. The structure of a 
two-layer optical fiber containing luminescing impurities and a 
block diagram of the fiber optic luminescent device are cited, 
and the design and operating principles of this low-intensity 
fiber optic luminescent device designed on the basis of the 
above characteristics are described in detail. The operating 
principle makes it possible to combine the function of injecting 
light into thin fibers and isolating spectral radiation bands 
which are most effective in given procedures. The device's 
ability to generate pulse radiation greatly increases the 
strength of the postoperative sutures; a 40 Hz frequency is 
optimal, and red light (600-680 nm) is the most efficient. 
Experiments with animals and donor blood demonstrates that 
monochromated light has a favorable effect on skin tissue 
regeneration. Figures 3; references 9.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Konorov: ``Will There Be Any Newtons for </F>
Us?''] 
  [Text] A round table has been held in the Ministry of 
Science and Technology Policy. 
  In opening the discussion, Head Minister Boris Saltykov 
stressed that the basic goal of State policy in the area of 
science and engineering is to retain the best part of the 
scientific-technical potential of Russia under conditions of 
economic collapse. 
  Boris Saltykov bitterly noted that all last year, due to the 
lack of adequate funding, scientists had to think about holding 
on to science rather than development. 
  However, we managed to do quite a bit even under these 
difficult conditions. Forty one State scientific-technical 
programs were set up and put into operation. Proposals have been 
prepared on implementing 117 priority technologies and new kinds 
of goods within the scope of State structural policy. Funding 
has been obtained for 33 State science centers, which has 
enabled retention of leading science schools in the high-tech 
field. 
  As one of the foremost among the republics of the former 
Soviet Union, Russia has been first to enter as a full-fledged 
member into the European technological program ``Eureka.'' An 
intergovernmental agreement has been concluded on 
scientific-technical cooperation with the United States. 
International scientific-technical cooperation of Russia has 
enabled continuation of many research projects in the field of 
high-energy physics, the human genome and genetic engineering, 
and promising information technologies. 
  However, the speakers noted that the situation in science 
and 
technology is getting tenser. As before, science is being funded 
by the month, and by leftovers. For example, last year science 
organizations were underfunded by about 300 billion rubles. 
  Numbers of science personnel are also diminishing, both 
because of the outflow of scientists to the private sector, and 
because of the ``brain drain'' abroad. The best people are 
leaving. The prestige of work in science has waned, there is a 
reduction in the percentage of graduates from institutions of 
higher education that train science personnel, schools of 
science and whole disciplines are breaking up. 
  There has been a sharp reduction in volume of agreements 
between enterprises and science organizations, the construction 
of science projects has been curtailed, unique structures are 
falling into disrepair. The breaking of ties between 
organizations of the former Soviet republics is having an 
enormous detrimental impact on the development of science. 
  Lack of cash is decelerating and downscaling international 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Roman Vershillo: ``Russian Science: To Strangle </F>
or Not to Strangle? There Won't be Any More Broad Research 
Front''] 
  [Text] Minister Boris Saltykov warned journalists gathered 
at the round table in the Ministry of Science and Technology 
Policy that the subject was going to be mainly about money, or 
rather about the lack of it. As should have been expected, last 
year the Ministry of Finance came up 300 billion rubles short, 
which is 30 percent of the total budgetary expenditures for 
science. In January and February of 1994, totals of 27 percent 
and 40 percent respectively were allocated. 
  Saltykov caused a sensation by stating that the space 
program 
had been 148 percent financed. Aircraft builders also got a 
surplus. ``And for all that, the general `science' budget was 
not increased by a single copeck,'' said the Minister. ``The 
chosen ones thus got some of the money of ``disowned'' fields.'' 
As it turns out, the mysterious reason for this situation is 
that last autumn Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visited 
``Energiya'' Scientific Production Association. The Prime 
Minister confronted Saltykov: ``Why didn't you tell me before 
that such remarkable specialists are working there?'' 
  ``The Russian Government cannot afford to support a broad 
research front,'' maintains Boris Saltykov. As an alternative to 
the Soviet course, where ambitious projects were carried out at 
the expense of the entire society, the Ministry of Science has 
put forth a program of priorities. 
  Among these are production technologies, information science 
and communications, development of new materials, power 
engineering, transportation, life sciences and genetic 
engineering, ecology, space, research on fundamental problems of 
the social and cultural development of Russia, and also research 
on the fundamental properties of matter. Thirty three State 
Science Centers have been set up to deal with these areas. Of 
course, all science institutions of Russia are making efforts to 
get into State Science Centers. The Ministry of Science has 
received more than 200 applications. As implied by Saltykov's 
words, the State Science Centers are not entirely maintained by 
the State. Funding will be granted only to specific scientific 
developments that have passed muster by experts within the walls 
of the ministry. 
  Among the other problems that have beset Russian science, 
mention was made of the exodus of skilled personnel out of the 
country, and also to the private sector. Vladimir Mikhaylin, 
chairman of the Union of Scientific Societies of Russia, has 
pointed out that there has been a drastic decline in the number 
of scientists in the 30-40 year age bracket. 
  Saltykov gives assurances that he is doing everything 
possible to keep the powers that be from strangling our science. 
But he admitted that scientists do not have the capability of 
turning off a valve, like people in the oil industry, or cutting 
off coal shipments, like the miners. So the minister is pretty 
sure that it would do no good for scientists to go on strike.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Corresponding </F>
Member Anatoliy Shpak, academy chief scientific secretary, by 
Dmitriy Kiyanskiy; place and date of interview not given: ``What 
is Happening With the Academy? For the Government's Information: 
If the Most Urgent Steps Aren't Taken, Serious Science May Soon 
be Nonexistent in Ukraine''] 
  [Text] Two doctors of sciences complaining of general 
weakness, fast tiring and noise in their ears visited the Kiev 
hospital servicing scientists almost simultaneously. An 
examination revealed that both of the elderly gentlemen were 
suffering from anemia with, of all things, chronic 
undernourishment as the cause. 
  Recently I needed an old friend in an urgent matter--a 
division director in a certain academy institute. I phoned him 
at work, but there was no answer. An hour later, the same 
result. When I dialed his home, I heard the voice of my friend. 
  ``What's the matter,'' I asked, ``you sick?'' 
  ``No,'' he said. ``Luckily I'm healthy, but like with all of 
my colleagues I'm now working as a scientist at home. The 
institute building isn't heated, and we were let out until 
spring.'' 
  Here's another fact. It was reported in the Presidium of the 
Ukrainian Academy of Sciences that the issue of reorganizing a 
number of scientific research institutes in connection with 
their inability to work under the new conditions is now on the 
agenda. 
  Yes, something isn't right in the kingdom of science. And 
judging from everything, the disease won't be cured with mustard 
plasters, berry tea, and lime blossoms. Medicines of higher 
efficacy are needed. 
  What is happening with the Academy of Sciences, which just 
recently stood on one of the top rungs of the social 
hierarchical ladder? Can something really be jeopardizing the 
existence of such a mighty and reliable structure? A PRAVDA 
UKRAINY correspondent discusses these questions with ANU 
[Ukrainian Academy of Sciences] Corresponding Member Anatoliy 
Shpak, the academy's chief scientific secretary. 
  Kiyanskiy: What adjustments has the current energy 
crisis made in the activity of ANU institutions? After all, 
while historians, economists, philologists or theoretical 
physicists could work a few months at home when their institutes 
run out of money for heating, such a routine is not suited to 
experimental physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and 
representatives of many other scientific disciplines. 
  Shpak: To our great regret scientists in the 
humanities aren't the only ones who have to work at home. Our 
institutions are hundreds of millions of rubles in debt for heat 
and electric power, and a large number of scientific research 
institutes in the technical and natural sciences must switch to 
such a strange work routine, encountered nowhere else in the 
world. Thus, the temperature in the laboratories and offices of 
the institutes of colloidal chemistry and water chemistry, 
microbiology and virology, and molecular biology and genetics 
has been reduced to plus five degrees Celsius, and the 
scientists are forced to work at home. I'm afraid that such a 
``routine'' will last until May-June. 
  One extremely typical example could be cited here. The 
allotment of electricity to the Institute imeni Paton was 
reduced by a fourth. Strange, isn't it? Electric welding without 
electric power! Even our children are affected by the economic 
woes. Academy day care centers have closed down for a month (and 
perhaps more!): There's no money to keep them going. 
  Kiyanskiy: So what happened? Why has science 
transformed so quickly into a Cinderella? For what reason has it 
been put on starvation rations? Have the government bigwigs 
really decided to rectify the country's catastrophic financial 
situation at the expense of scientists, as if it's impossible to 
find any other means of avoiding economic ruin? 
  Shpak: That seems to be the case. Judge for 
yourself: Current financing, and all the more so the prospects 
for this entire year, are totally inadequate to even our most 
minimal needs. This pertains chiefly to fundamental research, 
without which the existence of civilized society is altogether 
impossible. And all the more so in a country that only recently 
embarked upon the path of independence. 
  As of today the state owes the academy 40 billion 
karbovantsy, and this is with regard for the sharply higher 
prices of fuel. The institutes are presently spending a third of 
their allocated funds on wages, while practically all the rest 
goes to energy resources. Our institutions spend hardly any 
money to obtain modern scientific equipment. And without it, 
it's altogether impossible to obtain results of any value. What 
are we here for, if not for that? 
  Recently Ukrainian scientists have been unable to maintain 
contacts with their own colleagues in the far and near frontier. 
There's no money for business trips. But why even talk about 
foreign countries!? It's a problem today just to travel to 
another city in Ukraine for a conference. The institutes have 
stopped subscribing to foreign scientific periodicals. And 
everyone knows, after all, that an information vacuum is 
contraindicated to science. 
  I know that the fuel situation in Ukraine is totally 
stressed, but economization and the economy are two different 
things. To deprive the academy of the needed minimum of energy 
resources actually means sapping the life blood of entire 
directions. The research equipment of the leading scientific 
centers consumes a rather large amount of energy--you can't do 
anything about that. Consider just the Institute of Nuclear 
Research. This is a huge complex of unique devices for 
experimentation in physics, including a nuclear reactor and 
accelerators. Two-thirds of the academy's associates work in 
such energy-intensive scientific institutions. It is precisely 
in such institutes that the country's intellectual potential is 
created. 
  Kiyanskiy: Just 5 years ago the wages of 
scientists evoked the unconcealed envy of all other Soviet 
workers. A doctor of science in charge of a division or a 
laboratory received 500 rubles, and felt himself to be extremely 
well-off. How much are scientific workers paid today? 
  Shpak: Before 1 December of last year a doctor of 
sciences received from 220,000 to 290,000 karbovantsy, a 
candidate of sciences received an average of not more than 
200,000, and a scientific research institute director (as a rule 
a prominent scientist and a member of the academy) received 
370,000 karbovantsy--almost as much as a taxi driver earned. An 
academician was paid a little more for his high scientific 
title--10,000 coupons, while a corresponding member was paid 
5,000. This amount was enough for one and a half chicken eggs. 
  The pay of scientists was tripled in December, but this is 
on 
the average. In general, to be honest, pay is different in 
different scientific institutions: No special subsidies were 
allocated to the academy. The institutes are facing a dilemma: 
pay for building space, or increase wages. Many are trying to 
find the golden mean. As a result it comes both hot and cold for 
them, as they say. Such that now even a yardman doesn't envy a 
doctor of sciences. 
  Some of my acquaintances--people with academic degrees and 
the highest qualifications--are forced to become taxi drivers 
for several hours in the morning before work and in the 
evenings, using their own cars. What choice do they have? Life 
is making them do it! You can't feed a large family today on 
scientific activity alone. 
  I can't help worrying when I look at some of our old 
academicians--prominent scientists who devoted the best years of 
their lives to science, and who now have to keep a mental tally 
of how much they spent today on a carton of milk and a can of 
sour cream, and of how many coupons are left over for tomorrow. 
The old academician goes to the store, and all he gets is grief: 
His paltry pension and academy benefits aren't enough for the 
most necessary things. 
  Need we be amazed that some scientists have decided to leave 
the country? Unfortunately the most energetic, promising and 
talented are the ones who are leaving: Young people have no 
faith in advancement, and in making a career of it in their 
homeland, they have no certainty in tomorrow. Even venerable 
scientists are now emigrating. Many of our former compatriots 
can be found in the West's leading scientific centers, though 
unfortunately, not only as professors. 
  Kiyanskiy: How many scientists has the country 
already lost? 
  Shpak: In the last two and a half years over 300 
persons left institutes of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences for 
business trips abroad for a period of over 6 months. 
Unfortunately one out of every three has not returned. We don't 
know what many of the scientists who left will do. The terms of 
their business trips aren't up yet. However, more than likely 
our institutes will not be seeing some of them anymore. 
  By the way, ``internal emigration'' is no less dangerous. 
Both young academy scientists and middle-aged people are leaving 
more frequently for commercial organizations. Science is losing 
prestige literally before our eyes. 
  The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is certainly experiencing 
one of the most difficult periods of its life. The situation in 
the institutes is now extremely complex, and to be honest, the 
spirits of their colleagues are rather low. It is already clear 
today, after all, that a large number of our scientific 
institutions will encounter very serious difficulties this year, 
and even the question of their very existence will possibly be 
raised. 
  In all probability, representatives of government structures 
arguing for ultraeconomical and clearly insufficient financial 
support to Ukrainian science believe that in the extreme case it 
could be mothballed until better times. But can it? Of course it 
wouldn't be difficult to literally freeze places like the 
institutes of cybernetics or molecular biology and genetics: 
Their colleagues work in cold offices anyway. But can you really 
freeze cybernetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines 
until better times? In 5-8 years they will fall hopelessly 
behind, and this will retard the entire state's intellectual 
development.

workers of the Minnauka [Ministry of Science, Higher Education 
and Technology Policy], but they weren't alone. Will the 
ministry remain a ministry? This question troubled all who found 
themselves in the zone of ``combat activities'' between the RAN 
[Russian Academy of Sciences] Presidium and the leadership of 
the Minnauka. Military terminology is certainly apropos in this 
situation--what other than a retaliatory blow can we call the 
December resolution of the RAN Presidium expressing the desire 
to lower the status of the Minnauka to a state committee? This 
was a response to the government's desire to cut the funding of 
the RAN. It was at the Minnauka, as the structure that would 
implement this policy, that the Presidium vented its wrath. 
  Each of the opposing sides has its own interests, which they 
feel agree with state interests. And each could quite soundly 
prove its righteousness. RAN leaders believe that all functions 
of fundamental sciences in the academy must be preserved. But 
the opinion of the government is that the state budget is unable 
to maintain the RAN in the form in which it now exists, and that 
priorities have to be chosen. This is what is at the root of the 
conflict. But as we can see, the forms of the struggle are 
arbitrary. 
  The ministry has remained a ministry. More than that, the RF 
Committee on Information was placed within its structure by an 
edict signed by President B. Yeltsin. The above-cited resolution 
of the RAN Presidium evoked differing assessments from the 
academic milieu. Some institute directors supported it 
completely: A letter to President B. Yeltsin written on the 
instructions of the Conference of Directors of Academy 
Institutions of the Moscow Region is published on this page. 
Extracts from letters from other Moscow directors expressing 
disagreement with some provisions of the resolution, 
particularly regarding the Minnauka, are presented here as well. 
Academicians of the Siberian Department of the RAN also 
expressed trust in the ministry. We decided to acquaint you with 
these letters, because they reflect not only the concrete 
situation but also a vision of how science is to live in the 
future. 
<H5>  Priority to the Priorities </H5>
  A group of directors of the largest institutes wrote a 
letter 
to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin in connection with 
adoption of a resolution by the RAN Presidium on 14 December 
1993 on financing the RAN and on matters relating to 
administration of science. The letter's authors agree with the 
provision of the resolution noting the insufficiency of basic 
financing of scientific institutes both in and outside the RAN 
system. 
  However, they believe the resolution errs when it suggests 
reorganizing the RF Ministry of Science and Technology Policy as 
the RF State Committee for Science and Technology, and focusing 
its activity on the problems of organizing, shaping, and 
monitoring fulfillment of scientific and technical programs. 
  In the opinion of the undersigned, institutes engaging in 
fundamental science must receive basic financing at least at the 
minimum level in order to preserve scientific potential, but 
under the conditions of the difficult economic situation, 
priority should be given to the principle of competitive 
financing of science. In the last two years the RF Ministry of 
Science and Technology Policy began implementing this principle 
systematically, and it enjoyed certain success on this path: 
Scientific collectives that achieve the greatest successes and 
possess the best foundation for research in the most promising 
direction receive priority financing through the Minnauka. 
  The authors of the letter feel this policy of the Minnauka 
to 
be correct in principle, and they support it. The departmental 
principle of financing science proposed by the RAN Presidium, 
according to which money is distributed among the institutes by 
departmental leadership (in the Academy of Sciences by the RAN 
Presidium) is deleterious to science--it will result in the 
uniform impoverishment and demise of all science in Russia. 
  Therefore in the opinion of the letter's authors the 
suggestion by the RAN Presidium to fundamentally reorganize the 
Minnauka and sharply reduce the competitive principle will lead 
us on the wrong path, and is totally unacceptable. 
  The letter was signed by RAN Academician S. Belyayev, 
director of the Institute of General and Nuclear Physics of the 
Russian Kurchatovskiy Institute Scientific Center; RAN 
Academician L. Keldysh, director of the Physics Institutes of 
the Academy of Sciences imeni P. Lebedev; Professor A. Simonov, 
director of the Scientific Research Physicochemical Institute 
imeni L. Karpov; and others, nine persons in all. 
<H5>  What's the Use of Recommendations? </H5>
  A message from Siberian scientists to Prime Minister V. 
Chernomyrdin signed by academicians V. Koptyug, D. Knorre, D. 
Derevyanko, A. Skrinskiy, V. Titov and V. Shumnyy, and RAN 
corresponding members K. Svitashev, Yu. Shokin and V. Kuleshov 
notes that far from all activity of the Minnauka has been 
supported by the scientific community. But they feel that 
``elimination of a government body at the highest level 
responsible for `meshing together' the efforts of scientific 
collectives of different departments and integrating them in the 
solution of the most important problems of science and applied 
science threatens destruction of state scientific and technical 
policy. And this harbors very grave losses for the country. 
Replacement of a responsible government body by an advisory one 
will not save the situation under today's conditions. The unity 
of state scientific and technical policy would be lost.'' 
<H5>  Are These the Forms the Reform is Supposed to Take? </H5>
  Now that hopeful signs of political stabilization have 
appeared following adoption of the new Constitution and election 
of the Federal Assembly, and sensible correction of the course 
of the reforms currently under way is planned, we, the 
scientists of Russia, find it necessary to state our position 
regarding processes occurring in Russia and in Russian science, 
without the apprehension that our opinion might be used to 
incite passions and disturb equilibrium in the society. 
  The Russian intelligentsia was one of the main driving 
forces 
of the reforms and democratic transformations. It was among the 
first to understand the deleteriousness of the economy's 
extensive development in the former USSR, having indicated the 
existence of a direct correlation between quality of life and 
the need for converting the economy to new technologies created 
by science. The turn in socio-economic relations to the freedom 
of creativity, to the freedom of entrepreneurship for the good 
of Russians is the strategic direction of the reforms that 
attracted the scientific and technical intelligentsia. 
  But the real results of the reforms are far from what was 
anticipated. A great country has been transformed before our 
eyes into a helpless organism. 
  Scientific discoveries and new technologies that even before 
were introduced into production with difficulty are now simply 
unwanted. How can we discuss application of new technologies 
when vitally important enterprises are being shut down, and 
industrial investments are becoming purely symbolic? 
  Financing of Russian science has diminished to dangerous 
levels. The especially grave consequences of this manifested 
themselves in fundamental research. Its situation is presently 
deteriorating from critical to catastrophic. Scientific 
observations providing for prompt notification regarding natural 
disasters (tsunamis and earthquakes for example) are coming to a 
halt, the work of world-renowned scientific centers is being 
terminated, and research on the most important state programs is 
being abandoned. 
  Scientists are being forced to leave the institutes that 
have 
been their homes, and go abroad or join commercial organizations 
in search of a better share. Young replacements are not going 
into science. Scientific conferences, materials and reagents, 
scientific literature, and experimental devices have become 
luxuries beyond reach. 
  Science is an integrated living organism, and it does not 
tolerate interruptions in its growth and development. Any delay 
in this development may cause Russia to fall many decades and 
generations behind the world cultural and technological level, 
and the country to fall back to secondary scientific positions. 
  It has long been established that world science is 
indivisible. Russian science is a recognized component of it. 
The demise of Russian science cannot but have consequences, and 
it will be detrimental to all world science. This understanding 
of the role of Russian science is precisely one of the main 
motivating factors behind the assistance being provided to it 
from without. However, no assistance can replace providing for 
the normal vital activities of science. Only the state can 
accomplish this task. 
  While we are totally grateful to those who are sincerely 
helping Russian science in its hour of need, we cannot ignore 
the fact that Russia is sending abroad, in mass numbers and free 
of charge, highly qualified scientists and specialists whose 
selection and training require a great deal of time and 
significant outlays. The losses to the CIS countries by the end 
of the 1990's from intellectual emigration, calculated by United 
Nations procedures, will be tens of millions of dollars annually. 
  Basic state budget financing of fundamental research, 
scientific schools, and the principle of accessibility of the 
sphere of science to every citizen of the country, regardless of 
class membership, are the principal mechanisms by which vital 
and creative energy flows into Russian science. These mechanisms 
were developed over the course of centuries, and they have 
demonstrated their practical effectiveness. Now they are being 
destroyed. 
  Appropriation of budgetary assets to science by the state is 
one of the forms of long-range investment. Investing assets into 
science is economically advantageous, and it is a practice 
followed by all developed countries. 
  Even in the extremely difficult years of the Great Patriotic 
War and postwar devastation, the country found the possibility 
to provide real support to its science, and use the results of 
scientific research and development for constructive purposes. 
  Today, however, a strange kind of deformation has occurred 
in 
the society's perception of science and of the labor of 
scientists. The authority of academy science has been 
undermined, and its importance to the life of the country is 
being glossed over. 
  Despite the edicts of the Russian president ``On Creation of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences'' and ``On Material Support to 
Russian Scientists,'' which raised the hopes of the scientific 
community, economization of budgetary expenditures on 
fundamental research continues. Can we really have any serious 
hope of rectifying the state of affairs with the state budget by 
reducing and postponing essentially negligible payments to 
science? It doesn't take more than 0.5 percent of the country's 
budget to support the entire Russian Academy of Sciences for a 
single year, after all, at the same time that when practical use 
is made of the results of scientific developments, they return 
hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of rubles. 
  There is one other subject about which we are deeply 
concerned: the appearance of information in the mass media on 
plans for restructuring science that would jeopardize the very 
existence of the RAN. Democratic transformations must not lead 
to the destruction of the Russian scientific school, the 
traditions of which ascend from the era of Peter the Great. 
  The path to normalization of relations between government 
and 
science lies through recognition of their interdependence. 
Russian science will perish without government support, but 
after that, not only rebirth of a democratic Russian state but 
even its survival in the modern science-intensive world will be 
impossible. 
  We believe that the existing creative potential of Russian 
scientists must be mobilized to lead the country out of its 
crisis. 
  We will support reforms directed at improving the living 
conditions of the majority of Russians, and at freedom of the 
creativity of the individual, at the flourishing of science, and 
at modernization of production on the basis of modern high 
technology and honest entrepreneurship for the good of every 
inhabitant of Russia. 
  Scientists are ready to take part in developing the course 
and program of the reforms, and in implementing them. We can 
make a contribution to the Russian economy's rebirth. We have 
created materials with unique properties, developed energy and 
resource conserving procedures, new information technologies, 
bioengineering, the means of protecting and restoring the 
environment, of conserving and making sensible use of biological 
resources, and of obtaining energy, new medical preparations and 
medical equipment, and many other things. 
  Finding themselves together with most Russians in a 
difficult 
material position, Russian scientists are not fighting for 
outlandish wages, although in civilized countries the status of 
the scientist presupposes a worthy material reward. Russian 
scientists demand just one thing today--the possibility for 
working productively in their country, and in their professional 
sphere--science. 
  It stands to reason that we clearly recognize the need for 
improving the forms of work of both Russian science as a whole 
and of its nucleus--the Russian Academy of Sciences. But we, the 
scientists, must do this ourselves, and in such a way as to 
preserve the best historically evolved traits of Russian science 
as a phenomenon of worldwide cultural importance. 
  Believing the issues discussed here to be exceptionally 
important to development of the positive directions of 
transformations in Russia, we appeal to you to meet personally 
with the leading Russian scientists at the soonest possible 
moment convenient to you. 
  In behalf and on the instruction of directors of 
academy institutes of the Moscow Region: RAN Academician Yu. 
Gulyayev, Academician G. Arbatov, Academician Yu. Zolotov, 
Academician N. Lyakishev, Corresponding Member Yu. Altukhov.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Saltykov (prepared for publication by </F>
Vladimir Khrustov); ``Approaches Change, Priorities Remain: 
Boris Saltykov, RF Minister of Science and Technical Policy, on 
Priorities in State Scientific and Technical Policy''] 
  [Text] In the present day socio-economic situation we have 
been forced to lay aside our former approaches when research was 
carried out on a broad front in all directions of world science. 
Today, due to the shortage of funds, this is impossible. 
However, the acute problem arises, under conditions of economic 
decline, of preserving the best part of the scientific and 
technical potential of Russia and at the same time adapting it 
to the requirements of a market economy. Accordingly, the 
priorities in the development of science and technology are 
clearly defined. First and foremost among these are production 
technologies and new materials, information science and 
communications, power engineering and transportation, biology, 
ecology, and space. 
  We are seemingly implementing the priority policy at three 
levels. The first is state scientific and technical programs. 
Forty-one such programs have been drawn up and implemented, 
within whose framework 117 priority technologies and new types 
of production will be introduced. 
  In addition, priorities have been defined among scientific 
institutions. These are what we today call state scientific 
centers. This is the second level. 
  After the entire old (ministerial) control system had 
collapsed, the branch scientific research institutes found 
themselves in a most difficult situation, especially those in 
the defense sector. The danger appeared of their complete loss 
due to the fact that the ordinary sources of funding had 
disappeared. 
  Today 33 state scientific centers are therefore being 
funded, 
these including 55 organizations and enterprises, which is 
making it possible to preserve key national scientific schools 
in the high technologies field. These include the group of 
aviation centers headed by the Central Aerohydrodynamics 
Institute, five nuclear groups headed by the Kurchatov 
Institute, shipbuilding, electronics, chemical, and other groups. 
  Finally, there are priorities at the level of small research 
bodies and laboratories, which, in academic science, for 
example, has been realized through the Fundamental Research 
Fund, already established in 1992. Reference is to the 
development of new organizational forms of innovative activity: 
business incubators, industrial parks, etc. For this purpose a 
special decree of the government has established a fund which is 
designated for support of small entrepreneurship in the 
scientific and technical field, also including the financial 
field. Most importantly--promising projects with a heavy 
scientific orientation have been initiated. 
  However, the situation in the scientific and technical 
sphere 
is deteriorating. Science, as before, is being funded on the 
residual principal: during 1993 the funding of civilian 
scientific research and experimental-design work was only 
72.9% 
of the planned annual amount; scientific organizations thus did 
not receive about 300 billion rubles. 
  It is true that in the ``scientific budget'' proper there 
are 
some interesting ``internal'' peculiarities. To be sure, 
everyone has suffered. But they have lacked to an unequal 
degree. The academic-university sector received approximately 
82% of the planned sums and the Russian Academy of 
Sciences a 
little more than 84% and its departments also received 
different percentages: Far Eastern--88%, Ural--81%. 
Incidentally, here there is some confusion which sometimes 
bursts onto the pages of newspapers: why does the Ministry of 
Science and Technical Policy not give the Academy of Sciences 
money? The fact is that the Russian Academy of Sciences (and 
also the Academies of Medical or Agricultural Sciences) has its 
own item in the federal budget and receives money independently. 
  What is true is that the Ministry of Science and Technical 
Policy is funding only priority scientific and technical fields. 
The most important of these are state scientific and technical 
programs, international and regional projects. We also have a 
program for assistance to the innovative sphere: business 
incubators, commercial and industrial insurance policies, 
industrial parks, of which there already are about 30. This 
program today is being separated off into a separate program and 
we have succeeded in creating (as I have said, a government 
decree has already been issued) a special individual fund which 
will support this program, assist inventors and new structures 
to get on their feet and to turn projects into realities. 
However, our ministry has received only 59% of the planned 
funding. 
  Who are the favorites? The space program: it has been 
allocated 148% of that planned by the budget. I do not 
regard 
such a situation to be entirely normal. Unfortunately, it is now 
not impossible that space also will soon experience the negative 
consequences of such a policy. Because if we no not develop 
electronics, chemistry, and new construction materials which are 
``stagnating'' under other programs, after 3-5 years we will 
exhaust the substantial advances which today are working for the 
space program. Accordingly, corrections are unquestionably 
necessary here. 
  Such disproportions cannot but be reflected in the fates of 
scientists and specialists. The trend of a continuous reduction 
in the scientific work force, beginning in 1991, also is 
persisting in 1993, and at rates outpacing the numbers in the 
economy. The prestige of scientific work has fallen. Including 
because of the low wages, which in November 1993 were 38% 
below 
the average for the economy. The percentage of university 
graduates linking their career to scientific work is declining. 
Thus, not only the personnel potential of Russian science is 
decreasing, but also the possibilities of its reproduction. The 
``brain drain'' problem has grown appreciably worse. 
  As indicated by the beginning of the year, the situation not 
only is not improving, but instead is worsening. And this is 
related to a considerable degree to energy prices. After they 
had ``retreated'' in the autumn, they rose sharply and by the 
end of the year many scientific centers had suffered seriously. 
For example, the High-Energy Physics Institute at Protvino, 
where the accelerator for just one session (and that for 2-3 
weeks) requires so much power that the bill is in the billions. 
There are a great many other power-hungry enterprises, 
especially those in the chemical industry. 
  In general, the situation is as follows: whereas earlier the 
expenditures for power were 7-10% of the budget, at a 
number of 
institutes they have now risen to 60% or more. Since no 
improvements are foreseen here, we have raised the question of a 
reduction of electric power rates for budgeted organizations. As 
well as on the indexing of expenditures on goods and materials. 
Because today the situation has taken on a near-catastrophic 
character: we pay little more than a meager wage, we light and 
heat facilities, and that's it. There is no money for carrying 
out scientific research (instruments, equipment, reagents, etc.). 
  Meanwhile January-February showed: from the Ministry of 
Finance we received from 27 to 40% of the planned amount. 
The 
situation with funding, I repeat, not only has not stabilized, 
but also continues to deteriorate. 
  However, despite the difficult situation in the country, the 
scientific and technical potential of Russia remains extremely 
strong. Many of our country's research and development projects 
are not simply competitive in the West, but sometimes are above 
and beyond the world level. Russia retains parity in such fields 
as power engineering, new materials, chemical technologies, 
genetics, and others. 
  It is a shame that the existing achievements are being put 
to 
practical use slowly. For example, up to 30-40% of the 
development work of scientific organizations in the agricultural 
field are finding no application at all in production and the 
genetic potential of varieties and hybrids of agricultural crops 
and breeds of animals is being used no more than 60%. 
  And what do we see as our principal goals in the immediate 
future? An individual item was introduced in the budget for a 
program for maintaining the largest national 
instruments--telescopes, experimental reactors, etc. This 
``forces'' institutes to use this expensive equipment for its 
intended purpose. 
  We intend to shift the emphasis from the macro- to the 
micro-level. Several funds have been established for broadening 
the possibilities of choosing funding sources for scientific 
institutions and scientific workers. Today we are convinced that 
the principal problem is the micro-level: it is necessary to 
decide what to do within a scientific institution under the 
prevailing conditions. 
  One of the methods for implementing the priorities is a 
changeover to a contract hiring system. The principal obstacle 
is the archaic and conservative Labor Law Code. But meanwhile 
precisely a contract will make it possible to pay people for 
their work, not for the job which they fill. 
  The second acute problem: what in general to do with the 
network of scientific institutions? Today there is a clear-cut 
answer: categorically refuse to support from the budget those 
scientific structures, those scientific organizations which are 
unneeded by the state. The state must support fundamental 
science, which, incidentally, is by no means the case in all 
countries. It developed in Russia, it is our national tradition, 
it must be preserved, and we are doing everything possible for 
this. We will be able to maintain activity in a number of 
fund-hungry fields only, as we say, in a ``monitoring mode.'' 
This is necessary in order to keep an eye on the world level, 
and if, speaking figuratively, a ``supernova'' flares up, if 
some promising research field takes form, we can immediately 
jump in on its development, there could be ``nuclei'' on the 
basis of which new creative teams could be organized. But we 
acknowledge that the maintenance of all fields at the state 
level is today unrealistic. 
  We also will insist on such an aspect as keeping in contact 
with industry. We will develop a program for state scientific 
centers. Today, as I already mentioned, we are funding 33, and 
another 217 are standing ``in line.'' Some of them are entirely 
worthy of support, but we cannot include in this pool more than 
a score of new centers. We also will strive to establish a State 
Fund for Research in the Humanities.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Khrustov; ``Bauman Probably Will Become </F>
a State Scientific Center''] 
  [Text] It is desirable that a State Scientific Center be 
established on the basis of the famed Moscow State Technical 
University [formerly the Moscow Higher Technical School] imeni 
N. E. Bauman. That is the unanimous conclusion reached by 
participants in a joint session of the boards of the Ministry of 
Science and Technical Policy and the State Committee for Higher 
Education of Russia. This was a field session which was held at 
the Bauman Institute because it examined the problem of use of 
the scientific potential of the oldest technical school of 
higher education in the country. 
  The Bauman Institute--today a technical university--needs no 
special introduction: almost all the creators of aviation and 
rocket-space technology have graduated from its walls. But not 
many probably know that the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute, 
Moscow Aviation Institute and Moscow Systems Research Institute 
(as well as many other institutions of higher education) are 
``daughter'' enterprises of the Bauman Institute. 
  Today the technical university is experiencing difficult 
times. A sharp reduction in budgeted financing and orders for 
scientific research development work (during the last 3-4 years 
orders have decreased by a factor of 4-6) urgently dictate that 
additional measures be taken for preserving the scientific 
potential of the university, its scientific schools and the 
material-technical base. Incidentally, the latter by many 
criteria is unique. This applies, in particular, to the 
academic-experimental center of the university in Dmitrovskiy 
Rayon of the capital region, which in essence has today become a 
scientific city. 
  The understanding that a further lag in the development of 
science and education is fraught with irretrievable losses for 
society is today determining, as was noted by Igor Fedorov, 
academician ANS, rector of the Moscow State Technical 
University, in a conversation with a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
correspondent, the principal directions in the development of 
scientific research in the university and its activity as a 
whole. 
  The guests were shown an exhibit displaying the latest 
development work by the scientists and specialists of the Bauman 
Institute. Among the new materials and technologies, instruments 
and machines there are more than a few which are unique. For 
example, a robotized complex, better than its foreign analogues, 
has proven its worth in work on elimination of the consequences 
of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

<F P=106> [Article by Rudzhero Gilyarevskiy, Lyudvig Korotkevich and </F>
Arkadiy Chernyy: ``Still Another Strategic Resource. On the 
Doorstep: A System for Using Technical Information''] 
  [Text] With respect to coverage of the fields of science 
and technology, economic branches and regions, the USSR State 
System for Scientific and Technical Information (GSNTI) had no 
precedents in world practice. The centralization of the 
processing of the principal types of scientific and technical 
documents made it possible to avoid multiple duplication in the 
purchase and intellectual processing of literature, especially 
foreign literature and to reduce expenditures by branch and 
territorial systems substantially. 
  However, the declared objective of exhaustive coverage of 
the 
world scientific and technical literature was never attained. 
About 1,500 of the most important foreign periodicals were not 
received in the country and the transactions of important 
scientific conferences, foreign reports and dissertations were 
received only from time to time. 
  Now many of the information centers constituting parts of 
the 
USSR GSNTI are suffering a pitiful existence. The bonds among 
them have been weakened or completely broken. The purchases of 
foreign scientific and technical literature have been sharply 
reduced. The Russian State Library does not receive and 
therefore is unable to make many national periodicals available 
to readers. 
  The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian 
Federation (RF) is trying to maintain ``fragments'' of the USSR 
GSNTI, by tradition more or less uniformly distributing crumbs 
from the state budget among them. 
  Meanwhile commercialization is strongly intruding in the 
activity of the scientific and technical information (STI) 
services. For example, the State Public Scientific-Technical 
Library of Russia has already introduced pay for servicing of 
enterprises and organizations with literature on interlibrary 
loan, although its funds come exclusively from the state budget. 
Thus, there is actual privatization of that which has already 
been paid for completely by the taxpayers. 
  A decree of the RF government, No. 16, dated 6 January 1993, 
strengthening the strictly centralized management of the 
territorial STI centers in the republics, krays and the oblasts 
of the RF, was a questionable attempt at reanimating a part of 
the USSR GSNTI. The structures whose principal objective not 
long ago was the servicing of the oblast and kray committees of 
the CPSU, are continuing to be controlled from Moscow without 
participation of the governments of the republics and local 
administrations, be it in Yekaterinburg, Kazan or Yakutsk. Among 
the great variety of problems to be dealt with the first one was 
by far not the most important and it was solved in the spirit of 
the old traditions. 
  It must be stated that there is no clear concept with 
respect 
to the organization and development of a STI system in the 
Russian Federation either in the government or in the Ministry 
of Science and Technical Policy. 
  What should be the state policy of the RF in the STI field 
in 
order to ensure the most complete and efficient use of the 
information resources available in the country and beyond its 
borders? 
  In the process of changeover to a market economy in the RF 
the appearance of private (including commercial) STI centers 
also was inevitable. However, there should be complete or 
partial (50-60%) state financing of STI centers and 
scientific-technical libraries servicing economic sectors 
vitally important for the country but not yielding a direct 
profit. 
  It is necessary to embody in the law and realistically 
ensure 
the right of each citizen-taxpayer to free access to any 
information: socio-political, scientific, technical, commercial 
and other, collected or created using the resources of the state 
budget. Payment can be levied only for additional services with 
an added cost for covering the actual expenditures for rendering 
these services, but without receiving a profit. 
  The reliability of an information servicing system is 
predetermined primarily by the completeness of coverage and 
routineness in processing of the world flow of STI. The most 
effective means here is the centralization of collection, 
systematization, referencing and indexing of all the scientific 
and technical information appearing in the world. It is 
important to guarantee the receipt in the country, at least in a 
single copy, of all publications which may be of interest for 
Russian scientists and specialists. 
  Databases (DB), usually constituting electronic versions of 
printed publications, that is, newspapers, journals, 
encyclopedias, reference books, etc., are becoming an 
increasingly more important type of STI sources. In 1992 
throughout the world there were more than six thousand generally 
accessible DB with an annual increase in their number by more 
than 20%. However, there is not even one well-developed 
country 
which can be completely reliant on the physical or electronic 
supply (importation) of foreign DB because this would put it in 
increasing dependence on the supplying countries. 
  The STI system also must include a service for the rapid 
preparation and delivery of copies of original sources to 
readers. In order to meet the needs for information with minimum 
expenditures it is necessary to have integrated information 
systems: they are based on the one-time processing of STI 
sources and the input of the corresponding data into a computer 
with their subsequent repeated use. 
  A matter of concern of countries should be the supply of 
information to small and intermediate enterprises and companies. 
Since such enterprises are usually incapable of maintaining 
their own STI services, the state must ensure the preparation of 
the information which they require and favorable conditions for 
acquiring it. 
  An increase in the information literacy of scientists and 
specialists also is becoming an important prerequisite for the 
efficient use of STI. 
  Taking into account what has been said, it appears that the 
STI system in the RF must be organized in the following way. The 
state, public and private STI centers, scientific-technical 
publishing houses, libraries, intermediary and consultation 
companies should form the national network of STI agencies. The 
STI centers, libraries and other information structures 
servicing spheres vitally important for the country and 
therefore financed from the state subject should be combined 
into a State STI System (GSNTI RF) whose operations are 
organized on a nonprofit basis. 
  The GSNTI RF should include the following principal types of 
information agencies: STI functional institutes and centers, 
carrying out the most complete possible collection of 
publications and unpublished documents, their intellectual 
processing, preparation of DB and information publications (in 
electronic or printed form) and their dissemination, thematic 
STI centers whose principal function would be the selective 
dissemination and retrospective subject-thematic information and 
document search--predominantly in a remote dialogue access 
mode--on the basis of use of DB made available by licenses or 
acquired from those organizing them, a center for the routine 
issuance of copies, a translation center and ``brain centers'': 
administratively independent scientific research organizations, 
preparing under special order predictions of development, 
analytic reviews and summaries. 
  The territorial STI centers, scientific-technical libraries 
in the republics making up the RF, and also in the krays and 
oblasts, must be established, maintained and controlled by the 
governments of these republics, the authorities in the krays and 
oblasts. 
  The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian 
Federation can be seen as the principal coordinator of 
development and implementation of state policy in the STI field. 
It could rely on an interdepartmental STI committee.

  [Abstract] The known possibility of selective chemical and 
electrochemical deposition of metals on surface films of 
titanium dioxide from aqueous solutions containing the 
corresponding metals is governed by the fact that the deposition 
process rate, both chemical and electrochemical, increases 
markedly on those portions of the surface modified with metallic 
particles (Ag, Pd, Ni, and others). At 10[.sup]14[/] - 
10[.sup]16[/] atoms per cm[.sup]2[/] silver content, it 
becomes possible to realize selective electrochemical deposition 
of a metal phase onto modified portions of the film. In this 
case, the rate of electrochemical deposition on them is 10 or 
more times greater than that on film portions not containing 
silver. The properties of microheterogeneous systems of the 
oxide-metal particle type, in which the oxide acts as a carrier, 
largely depend on the specifics of particle-carrier interaction. 
An important role is also played by the oxygen adsorbed from the 
atmosphere on the surface of a semiconductor and on the metal 
particles. In the case of the system TiO[.sub]2[/]-Ag 
particles, the selectivity of the electrochemical deposition 
process, as manifested in changes in the process kinetics and a 
drop in overvoltage in comparison with deposition on 
TiO[.sub]2[/] films not containing silver, may be due to 
special features in the interaction between the silver particles 
and the TiO[.sub]2[/] film. Previous research concerned 
mainly the electro- and photoelectro-chemical characteristics of 
the system, and the status of silver on the TiO[.sub]2[/] 
surface remained unclear. In the present work these properties 
of silver particles in a Ag-TiO[.sub]2[/] system were studied 
employing electochemical methods, electron microscopy, and X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy. At 10[.sup]14[/]-10[.sup]16[/] 
atoms per cm[.sup]2[/] silver concentration on the surface, 
the presence of 5-100 nm sized silver particles was confirmed, 
and a marked a marked interaction between the silver and the 
TiO[.sub]2[/] surface was observed. Figures 3; references 20:

  [Abstract] The electro-physical properties of high 
temperature superconductors, as observed at low temperatures, 
are determined by the conditions under which they were prepared 
at high temperatures, and for this reason study of phase 
equilibria and stability over a wide range of temperatures and 
oxygen partial pressures is of primary importance to the 
preparation of ceramic materials and films having good working 
characteristics. The notion of determining the area of 
thermodynamic stability of a substance comes down to the fact 
that any unforeseen changes in properties are excluded at 
equilibrium in this area; by fixing the thermodynamic variables, 
thermodynamics guarantees preservation of the state of 
equilibrium and also determines the trend and final result for 
any given changes in the system. The title phase (123), as well 
as others, may, and in fact does exist beyond the limits of the 
stated thermodynamic equilibrium range of temperature, pressure, 
and composition. This can only be metastable or frozen (labile) 
states of matter. In the first case the state may exist 
indefinitely, so long as no sources of activation energy, 
necessary for transition to stable equilibrium, enter the 
system. In a previous work, the thermodynamic stability of the 
123 solid solution was determined on the basis of the results of 
a thermodynamic study of the system Y-Ba-Cu-O. In the present 
work the most recent data on the thermodynamic properties of 
this phase were used to calculate stable and metastable phase 
equilibria within the title system. The area of thermodynamic 
stability of this phase was constructed for the coordinates 
composition-temperature and partial oxygen pressure-temperature. 
The results were compared with existing published results of 
direct experimental research and the thermodynamic properties of 
Y[.sub]2[/]BaCuO[.sub]5[/] and the solid solution 
YBa[.sub]4[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]8.5+q[/] were 
estimated. Figures 2; references 39: 7 Russian, 32 Western.

  [Abstract] Specimens of surface-layer sorbents (fractions 
of 0.16 to 0.22 mm) were prepared based on chromosorb G-AW, 
inerton AW, and Celite-545 with molecular sieves of the type 
NaX, NaY, and Na-mordenite and a crystal size of 1 to 10 m. 
The content of active adsorbent on the surface of each 
surface-layer sorbent ranged from 20 to 50 percent of the solid 
carrier's weight. An LKhM-8MD gas chromatograph with a heat 
conduction detector was used for the studies; helium or hydrogen 
served as the carrier gas. A stainless steel column was filled 
by means of a vacuum pump and conditioned at 300C for 3 
hours. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate, column 
capacity coefficient, and criterion for the separation of 
various vapors (K[.sub]p[/]) were determined to estimate the 
surface-layer sorbents' quality and properties. The 
surface-layer sorbents' chromatographic properties were found to 
depend on the active sorbent used, the amount of active sorbent, 
and the type of solid carrier. The analytical packed columns 
containing the study surface-layer sorbent specimens had CO 
capacity coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 1.4. Inerton AW with 
33 percent NaX, Celite-545 with 20 percent NaX, and chromosorb 
G-AW with 30 percent NaY had the highest capacity and separative 
power. The surface-layer sorbent proved more efficient than did 
the bulk sorbent used for purposes of comparison: Unlike the 
conventional sorbent, at high carrier gas velocities (100 to 300 
ml/min), when the wash-out of the moving band of sorbate is 
dictated by the kinetics of mass transfer only in the 
near-surface layer, the surface-layer sorbent manifested only a 
slight drop in efficiency. Use of the surface-layer sorbent thus 
made it possible to reduce the height equivalent to a 
theoretical plate and to simultaneously reduce the generally 
observed dependence of the increase in height on an increase in 
carrier gas velocity, which is especially important when 
performing fast analyses. When high-efficiency columns filled 
with surface-layer sorbent were used, fast analysis of a mixture 
of fixed gases was completed in only 10 to 13 seconds (versus 
the 6 minutes required in the case of a column filled with bulk 
adsorbent). In columns of a surface-layer sorbent containing 
NaX, K[.sub]p[/] equaled 1.67 for nitrogen/nitrogen oxide 
vapor and 1.52 for nitrogen/carbon oxide vapor. Figures 5; 
references 2 (Russian).

  [Abstract] A study examined ways of varying the number of 
functional groups on the surface of mesoporous and macroporous 
carbon sorbents. A method of directed hydroxylation of the 
surface of a uniformly mesoporous carbon sorbent that had been 
subjected to heat treatment in a vacuum at 2,200C for 4 
hours was tested. The carbon specimens were subjected to 
chlorination at temperatures between 200 and 600C. 
Additional treatment of the chlorinated specimens resulted in 
the attachment of hydroxyl groups to the carbon surface. The 
said treatment was conducted at 200C until the release of 
HCl ceased. The adsorbents thus produced were subjected to 
adsorption studies; microcalorimetry; and mass, infrared, and 
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both qualitative and 
quantitative differences between the starting specimens and the 
hydroxylated specimens were evident. The infrared and x-ray 
photoelectron spectra of the hydroxylated specimens contained 
bands with peaks at 1050 and 1120 cm[.sup]-1[/] that were 
identified as stretching vibrations of the C-OH bond. Directed 
hydroxylation changed the chemical properties of the surface of 
the carbon specimens; specifically, it changed the number of 
primary centers of adsorption of water vapors. The greatest 
number of primary centers of water vapor adsorption formed when 
a chlorination temperature of 450C was used. The 
proportionality between the number of primary centers of water 
vapor adsorption and ceiling water vapor sorption that is 
expected during the process of water-vapor saturation as 
identical water clusters form on the surface of carbon sorbents 
did not occur during the experiments. This lack of 
proportionality was attributed to an uneven distribution of 
primary centers of water vapor adsorption along the adsorbent's 
surface that in turn led to partial coalescence of the water 
clusters and to the formation of ``islands'' of water. The 
decrease in the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the 
sorbents that occurred at 200 and 600C caused the surface 
of the carrier to fill to a lesser extent. As a result, a 
proportionality between the number of primary centers of water 
vapor adsorption, ceiling water vapor sorption, and heat of 
submersion in water for the hydroxylated specimens began to be 
evident. This principle was recommended for use in producing 
produce model sorbents that may be effectively used to produce 
active and stable immobilized enzyme preparations. The technique 
of grafting amino groups to a hydroxylated carbon surface was 
said to be superior to that of grafting amino groups to hydrated 
silica because the undesirable hydrogen bonds that form in the 
case of the silica gel do not form when hydroxylated carbon is 
used as a substrate. The surface of the most hydroxylated 
specimen produced was determined to contain 1 hydroxyl on every 
80 square angstroms, which is sufficient to accommodate at most 
about 20 amino groups in the case of an enzyme such as trypsin. 
For this reason, multiple-point binding was recommended as 
highly desirable for increasing the stability of immobilized 
preparations. Figures 4, table 1; references 7: 6 Russian, 1 
Western.

  [Abstract] The process of synthesizing sorbents and 
chromatographic carriers based on ultradisperse powders not only 
permits wide variation of the pore structure and surface 
properties but also makes it possible to create materials with 
actively sorbing surface pores. Packing and fixing ultradisperse 
particles in the form of granules and/or products makes it 
possible to obtain sorbents with uniform pores (i.e., with a 
narrow distribution of meso- and macropores). Grafting compounds 
with specified chemical properties to the surface of sorbents 
with uniform pores is, for example, necessary for immobilizing 
enzymes for chromatographic separation. The effectiveness of 
this technique may be seen by comparing the characteristics of 
starting and hydroxylated mesoporous carbon sorbent based on 
commercial-grade carbon. Hydroxyl groups located on the surface 
of carbon sorbents may also be used effectively to graft other 
functional groups such as amino groups, which may in turn serve 
as centers for immobilizing biologically active compounds. 
Sorbents based on ultradisperse powders may be produced by 1) 
creating primary transport porosity in the molding stage and 2) 
using heat treatment to develop meso- and macroporosity with a 
narrow distribution of pores from the standpoint of equivalent 
radii (with the pore volume and pore radius being determined by 
the diameter of the starting ultradisperse particles, molding 
pressure, amount of binder, and sintering temperature). Sorbents 
synthesized in this manner have a well-developed porosity (0.50 
cm[.sup]3[/]/cm[.sup]3[/], no micropores, and a narrow 
distribution of pores from the standpoint of equivalent radii. 
Additional thermochemical treatment in the form of 
high-temperature chlorination (or vapor-gas activation of carbon 
sorbents) may then be used to develop the volume of adsorbing 
micro- and supermicropores while maintaining transport porosity. 
In this way it is possible to synthesize adsorbents with a 
bipore structure from ultradisperse powders of materials that 
are not themselves active sorbents, such as metal carbides or 
metalloids. High-temperature chlorination of carbides or 
carbonitrides makes it possible, thanks to layer-by-layer 
reaction, to create a porous actively sorbing carbon layer. Such 
absorbents have proved to significantly reduce the time required 
for chromatographic analysis without in any way diminishing the 
separative power under one and the same set of conditions.

  [Abstract] The separation and identification of complex 
mixtures of compounds with similar physicochemical properties 
require the creation of new heat-resistance adsorbents that are 
sensitive to the electronic structure of the molecules being 
separated. In view of this fact, a study examined the mobility 
of adsorbed molecules (i.e., the changes in the entropy of 
adsorption) of organic materials on barium sulfate 
(BaSO[.sub]4[/]). The changes in entropy were calculated from 
values of Henry's constant and from changes in internal 
adsorption energy that were determined by gas chromatography. 
Experimental and calculated values were derived and compared. It 
was discovered that saturated hydrocarbons (n-alkanes and 
n-alkenes) interact with the surface of a BaSO[.sub]4[/] 
adsorbent nonspecifically, mainly on account of dispersion 
forces. The energy of nonspecific interaction on the surface of 
BaSO[.sub]4[/] is much lower than on the surface of a 
nonspecific nonpolar adsorbent such as graphitized thermal black 
(35 versus 49 kJ/mol, respectively, for 
n-C[.sub]8[/]H[.sub]18[/]). The adsorption of n-alkanes 
was found to be delocalized, and the heat of adsorption 
increased as the number of hydrocarbon atoms increased, which is 
to say that the mobility of the molecules on the surface 
decreases because of intensification of the dispersion 
interaction. In the cases of n-hexane and n-heptane, ultramobile 
adsorption was observed on BaSO[.sub]4[/]. In a homologous 
series of n-alkenes, the mobility of the adsorbed molecules 
decreased as a result of intensification of the dispersion 
interaction with the surface. The adsorption of aromatic 
hydrocarbons on the surface of BaSO[.sub]4[/] was also found 
to be delocalized. The molecules' mobility was limited because 
of -complexing of the -electrons of the benzene ring 
with 
the Ba[.sup]2+[/] cations. In the series 
benzene-butylbenzene, the mobility of the adsorbed molecules 
decreased as a result of an increase in the contribution of the 
dispersion interaction of the BaSO[.sub]4[/] surface with the 
alkyl radicals of the alkylbenzenes. The molecules of 
tetramethylbenzene formed stronger bonds with the surface than 
those of trimethylbenzene do; however the rotation of 
trimethylebenzene's molecules is more difficult than is the 
motion of the molecules of tetramethylbenzene because of the 
latter's great asymmetry. Adsorption of halogen-containing 
aromatic compounds was also delocalized; the mobility of their 
molecules on the BaSO[.sub]4[/] surface was limited (i.e., 
the rotational motion of the molecules was difficult). 
Adsorption of ethers and both unsaturated and aromatic 
hydrocarbons on the surface of BaSO[.sub]4[/] was 
delocalized, and the rotational motion of their molecules was 
difficult because of the interaction of the electron pairs of 
the oxygen atoms with the Ba[.sup]2+[/] cations and the 
interaction of the ether's dipoles with the electrostatic field 
of the BaSO[.sub]4[/] (an orientation interaction). Ethyl 
acetates were absorbed on BaSO[.sub]4[/] with a great deal of 
energy (the contribution of the energy of the specific 
interaction to the total energy of adsorption amounted to 43

  [Abstract] The effectiveness of three porous polymer 
adsorbents, i.e., Polysorb-1, Tepasorb-15, and Tenax-GC, as 
absorbers of n-alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, 
ketones, and n-alcohols was assessed by gas chromatography on a 
Tsvet-106 chromatograph with a flame-ionization detector. For 
each adsorbate in that temperature interval in which the 
adsorbent peaks were symmetrical and in which the retention time 
was virtually independent of the sample size (i.e., in the Henry 
interval), researchers calculated the specific volumes retained 
(V[.sub]m,1[/]) by each of the three adsorbents. From the 
dependence lg V[.sub]m,1[/] on 1/T, the researchers then 
calculated the adsorbents' differential heat of adsorption 
during the adsorption of zero samples, standard molar changes in 
the entropy of the adsorbate, and the extrapolated values of 
V[.sub]m,1[/] at 20C. From the dependence of the 
differential adsorption heat during the adsorption of zero 
samples they determined the contributions of the magnitudes of 
the energy of the specific interaction to the total heat of 
adsorption. The dependence of lg V[.sub]m,1[/] on 1/T turned 
out to be linear for all three polymer adsorbents studied. The 
values of the heats of adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons for 
the three adsorbents were lower than those for n-hydrocarbons 
with the same number of carbon atoms in the molecule, whereas 
the retained volumes were higher for aromatic hydrocarbons than 
for n-alkanes throughout all the temperatures studied. This was 
taken as an indication of the fact that in the case of aromatic 
hydrocarbons, dissolution processes may also be at work in 
addition to adsorption processes. The dependences of the 
differential heat of adsorption during the adsorption of zero 
samples on the number of hydrocarbon atoms in the molecule for 
different homologous series on all three polymers were linear. 
The adsorption heats found for ketones, ethers, and n-alcohols 
were different for the different adsorbents. This fact was 
attributed to the adsorbents' ability to manifest specific 
reactions with the said adsorbates in addition to dispersion 
interactions. Polysorb-1 and Tepasorb-15 were found to be 
virtually inert with respect to ethers; however, they engaged in 
additional specific reactions with alcohols and ketones on 
account of the -electrons of the benzene rings on their 
surfaces. The highest values of V[.sub]m,1[/] extrapolated 
for 20C were obtained for Polysorb-1, and the lowest were 
obtained for Tepasorb-15. Both in the present study and 
elsewhere, the properties of Tenax-GC have been found to remain 
quite stable from batch to batch. The properties of Polysorb-1, 
on the other hand, were found to be quite unstable and to vary 
from batch to batch. Figures 2, tables 7; references 18: 6

  [Abstract] Membrane distillation is a promising method for 
deep water demineralization and purification. Its attraction for 
processing of liquid radioactive waste is in its capability of 
deep water purification and concentrating all impurities in one 
flow. The article presents results of studies aimed at 
determining the effect of various surfactants on the efficiency 
of water demineralization by membrane distillation, and 
determining the depth of radioactive water purification from [.sup]137[/] 

Cs, [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]90[/]Y. It was 
found that membrane distillation was inefficient in purification 
or demineralization of water solutions containing surfactants 
unless surfactant molecules had been eliminated by some other 
means. It was also found that the use of membrane distillation 
made it possible to achieve a fairly high coefficient of 
purification of liquid radioactive waste and get a more 
concentrated brine. The article suggests implementation of the 
proposed method in a mobile unit for processing of liquid waste.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Levin: ``Eastern Project Begins''] </F>
  [Text] An underwater optical fiber communication line 
will link Russia, Japan and Korea by early 1995. Agreement was 
reached on this in Moscow by 17 international communications 
operators who signed a special agreement in June to begin 
construction of this telecommunications route. 
  The new optical fiber communication line will be laid across 
the bottom of the Sea of Japan between the cities of Nakhodka 
(Russia), Naoetsu (Japan) and Pusan (Korea). The length of the 
line will be 1,211 km in the section between Russia and Japan, 
1,026 km between Russia and Korea, and 1,196 km between Japan 
and Korea. Over 22,000 channels will be organized with modern 
digital transmission apparatus designed to work at a speed of 
560 Mbits/sec; 15,000 of these channels will begin carrying 
international telephone traffic between the Far East, Siberia 
and countries of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Russia's Intertelekom, Denmark's GNTC and Telecom Denmark, 
which are already known for creation of the Denmark-Russia 
optical fiber line, and Japan's KDD and Korea's Korea Telecomm 
were the initiators of the project and its principal investors. 
The outlays to erect the ``Eastern'' optical fiber communication 
line are estimated at $80 million U.S., with not a single kopeck 
being spent out of the state budget. Nonetheless, the part of 
the complex located on our territory and the section of 
underwater cable to its branch point will be Russian property. 
  An international consortium of three Japanese firms--KDD, 
Fujitsu and NEC--will lay the cable, install the underwater 
branching equipment and built the coastal stations. These firms 
obtained this large contract after winning a competition held 
not long ago. And Germany's Siemens will help the project's 
participants in building the 930-kilometer cable section from 
Nakhodka to Khabarovsk and to the international exchange in this 
city. 
  Interest in the new optical fiber communication line is 
great. Seventeen international operators, including 
Interetelekom (Russia), AT&amp;T and MCI (USA), ITJ and KDD 
(Japan), 
DACOM and KT (Korea), TELEGLOBE (Canada), Telstra (Australia) 
and others, have acquired space in the future optical route, as 
was reported to journalists at a press conference held during a 
June meeting in Moscow. 
  The Eastern project will have great significance not only to 
our country but also to the entire world community. As we know, 
it will become possible to close the ``global communication 
ring'' around the world only after Russia is covered by a modern 
telecommunications network. The appearance of the Far Eastern 
optical fiber communication line will become an important stage 
on this path.

  [Text]Investigation of epidemiological patterns of HIV 
infection revealed distinctive manifestation of the epidemic 
process in different territories [1-4]. 
  This article is based on the results of analysis of HIV 
infection cases recorded in the Russian Federation in 1987-1991 
and results of screening population groups designated by decree 
[for such screening] over the same period of time for presence 
of HIV antibodies. 
  We used the main parameters used to describe epidemiological 
patterns of this infection: breadth of spread, distribution 
according to sex, age and social structure. This enabled us to 
compare development of the epidemic process in Russia to this 
process in other territories, and to determine the distinctions 
of its manifestation. 
  The possibility of intramural spread of HIV infection was 
studied on the model of viral hepatitis B (HBV). For this 
purpose, 63 HIV positive children and 162 children who had been 
in contact with the former in pediatric hospitals and residing 
in Kalmykia, Volgograd and Rostov oblasts were tested for HBV 
markers. Children in one of the rayons of Moscow Oblast under 
clinical observation due to contact in a hospital with 
HIV-infected children (122) served as a control group. 
  HBV infection markers were demonstrated by the method of 
enzyme immunoassay using test systems of the DIA-Plus firm. 
Cases of demonstration of HBsAg were confirmed in the 
conformation test. 
  The first cases of HIV infection in the republic were found 
in 1987. In 1988, there was a build up of HIV-positive cases 
mainly referable to adults; in 1989, 4 sites of HIV infection 
were recorded in Kalmykia, Volgograd and Rostov oblasts, and 
Stavropol Kray, which caused a dramatic rise in number of 
HIV-infected individuals. The nature of the sites of HIV 
infection, namely detection of group involvement in pediatric 
hospitals, caused predominant involvement of children. In 1990, 
the number of new cases dropped considerably because of fewer 
cases of detection of infected children at the above sites. 
  In 1988, the incidence of HIV infection among adults 
doubled, 
as compared to 1987; in 1989 and 1990 the same number of 
HIV-positive cases was found -- 68 people in each year. In 1991, 
no trend toward rise was noted, which is indicative of 
invalidity of the forecast. 
  In all, as of 1 January 1992, there were 518 recorded cases 
of HIV infection, including 266 children up to 14 years old. The 
HIV-positive cases were recorded in 45 administrative 
territories. In 1991, 6 new territories, where only adults were 
infected, became involved in the epidemic process. In 1990, 
there were 8 such territories. This means that there is rather 
broad spread of infection in the republic, although the vast 
majority of HIV-infected individuals reside in major cities of 
its European part. 
  The diagnosis of AIDS was made in 61 cases, including 45 
children; there were 45 deaths, including 33 children. As a 
rule, 76 percent of adult AIDS victims expire within 1, 2 and 3 
years after the diagnosis is established. Such rapid evolution 
of the disease in adults is probablydue to late detection. 
  The ratio of HIV-positive men to women constituted a mean of 
1.5:1, ranging from 6:1 to 1:7 in different territories. Such 
fluctuations could be attributed to differences in social groups 
involved in the infectious process. 
  Analysis of the social structure of HIV infected adults 
revealed that most cases (50.4 percent) are referable to the 
so-called high risk groups (individuals who had sexual contacts 
with HIV-positive and AIDS cases, homosexuals and bisexuals, 
those with venereal diseases). However, in 1991, there was a 
decline in their share to 38.9 percent, versus 92.0 percent in 
1988. There was an absolute and relative increase in share of 
HIV-positive cases screening because of pregnancy: from 7.5 
percent in 1988 to 46.2 percent in 1991. Thus, at the present 
time, a considerable part of those who are infected, mainly 
women, is detected by chance. 
  We were impressed by the fact that in all these years we 
failed to detect a single case of HIV infection among drug 
addicts, or in the last 2 years among women who are promiscuous. 
  We observed a rise in incidence of HIV infection among 
individuals tested anonymously and for clinical indications. 
  The dynamics of age structure of adults infected with HIV 
have not changed. There is prevalence of individuals 20-44 years 
of age both in the total number and in different years, and they 
account for 94.4 percent of the cases. 
  In the case of adult infection, there is prevalence of the 
sexual route of transmission of the infection, and there was the 
same incidence of infection for both homosexuals and 
heterosexuals in different regions. 
  Of interest are the cases of HIV infection among adults in 
the southern part of the republic, where large sites of HIV 
infection among children were formed. In 1989, adults 
constituted 12 percent of all HIV-positive cases found in this 
region, and about half of the cases were related to the 
above-mentioned sites. In 1990, we found 20 HIV -positive 
adults, which constituted 30 percent of all HIV-positive adults 
recorded in 1990. Only three of these cases were related to the 
sites. 
  The total number of HIV-infection cases found is indicative 
of activity of the epidemic process in this region. There, the 
indicator of HIV infection constituted a mean of 0.16 per 
100,000 population, which is almost 2.3 times higher than the 
mean for the republic (0.07/100,000). 
  The indicator of HIV infection of the adult population in 
the 
southern region is also high: 0.2/100,000 and it equaled or 
exceeded the figure for territories where HIV infection is 
recorded mainly among adults (in Moscow this indicator 
constituted 0.1/100,000). 
  Only 15 percent of the cases of HIV infection in the 
southern 
region applies to individuals in the high risk groups, and this 
is 3.5 times lower than the mean for the republic. At the same 
time, 40 percent of the infected cases are women who were tested 
because of pregnancy. This warrants the assumption that 
individuals in the high risk groups, and first of all those who 
are promiscuous, are ``hiding'' under code 109. 
  The high intensity of HIV spread among adults warrants the 
belief that expressly they, including donors, were the primary 
source of infection for children in the region of the sites. 
  Of those who are HIV positive, 51.4 percent are children. 
Almost 87 percent of the child cases were found as a result of 
screening contacts at sites of HIV infection; infection of 23 
children was established on the basis of clinical indications; 1 
child was infected after receiving a blood transfusion from an 
infected donor; 14 children were born to HIV-positive mothers. 
  As compared to 1989, the frequency of detection of infected 
children at the sites diminished in 1990 and 1991; 5 children 
were picked up in 1991. 
  Analysis of the age structure of the child cases revealed 
predominant involvement of the younger ones: more than 75 
percent were children up to 3 years old. 
  We still are not clear as to the sources and routes of 
spread 
of infection caused by HIV in children groups. Unfortunately, as 
time passes the possibility of settling this question 
diminishes. The most popular opinion is that there was 
nosocomial infection in most such cases. However, by far not all 
of the cases fit into this version. 
  In this regard, it would be interesting to investigate the 
possibility and intensity of nosocomial spread of HIV on the 
model of an infection that has the same routes of spread as HIV. 
HBV infection could serve as such a model, particularly since 
the indicators of HBV for the population are considerably higher 
than HIV infection. 
  The results of screening children who were not infected with 
HIV andresided in territories where sites of HIV infection were 
recorded, revealed a high incidence of the infection caused by 
HBV. The incidence of detection of HBV infection markers 
constituted 29.0 percent, which is 3 times higher than in the 
control group. HBsAg carriers were demonstrated in 4.9 and 1.6 
percent of the cases. 
  Investigation of the results of screening children from 
Volgograd Oblast and Kalmykia revealed that the child population 
is more infected: the indicators of detection of HBV markers, 
including HBsAg carriers among children from Kalmykia were 
considerably higher (by 3 or more times) than for children in 
Volgograd Oblast (43.9 percent versus 14.3 percent, as well as 
9.7 percent versus 2.9 percent, respectively). 
  The wide distribution of HBV infection among children in 
Kalmykia warranted the assumption that virtually all HIV 
infected children will be stricken by HBV. However, the 
indicators of infection with this pathogen did not differ among 
HIV infected and noninfected children: the incidence of 
detection of HBV infection markers constituted 50.0 and 43.9 
percent, respectively. At the same time, among HIV-positive 
children from Volgograd Oblast, the frequency of detection of 
HBV-infection markers was reliably higher than in children who 
were not HIV positive: 75 percent versus 16.2 percent. A 
substantially higher percentage of HBsAG carriers was also found 
among them. These findings may be indicative of nosocomial 
spread of HBV infection. 
  In Rostov Oblast, only 30.0 percent of the HIV-positive 
children revealed markers indicative of HBV infection, and HBsAg 
carriers constituted 4.7 percent at this site. 
  Analogous figures were obtained in an analysis of the 
results 
of screening children 3-5 years old who made up to main (77.8 
percent) group of HIV-positive cases and noninfected child 
contacts, and they characterized the actual situation. 
  Thus, HBV infection as a model of HIV infection makes it 
possible to demonstrate differences in intensity of the epidemic 
process in different sites. 
  The low level of HBV infection among HIV-positive children 
at 
the site in Rostov Oblast, and absence of differences in 
frequency of demonstration of markers of HBV infection among 
HIV-infected and noninfected children in Kalmykia do not give us 
grounds to discuss active nosocomial spread of infection at 
these sites. It is only in Volgograd Oblast that we can assume 
there was rather intensive transmission of infection under 
hospital conditions.

  [Text] The accumulation of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/] 
Sr by the catkins and leaves of the European birch 
was studied in three pine and birch stands located 1.5, 6, and 
18 km from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. A change is 
demonstrated in the concentration of these radionuclides in the 
structural elements of the catkins and in the leaves in various 
years, and a quantitative characterization is given of the shift 
of radionuclides out of the soil into the generative organs and 
leaves. 
  It has been established that with aerial contamination of 
forest stands by radioactive substances, up to 40-50% of 
these 
are retained by the crowns of the trees (Tikhomirov, et al., 
1972; Naryshkin, et al., 1973; Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1973). 
At the same time, the structural elements of the crown play a 
disparate role in the circulation of radionuclides in forest 
biogeocenoses. Although among the annually deciduous parts of 
the crowns the leaves play the leading part in this process, it 
is necessary to take into account the contribution of the 
generative organs, the weight of which in some trees (for 
example, the willow and the birch) is quite high in the years of 
abundant fruit bearing. There are only brief reports in the 
literature on the content of radiocesium and radiostrontium in 
the crowns of birch growing in the environs of the CNPS 
(Yushkov, et al., 1990). 
  Data on the accumulation of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/] 

Sr by the generative organs and leaves of the 
European birch (Betula verrucosa Ehrh.) within the 
30-kilometer zone of the CNPS over the course of the first three 
years after the accident are presented in this paper. 
  In the first year of the investigation, 15-20 of the most 
abundantly fruit-bearing young, primarily 25-35 year old birch 
trees were selected in each of three pine and birch stands (Fig. 
1) located at a distance of 1.5 (Yanov settlement), 6 (Kopachi 
village), and 18 km (Bolshoy Cherevach village) from the 
destroyed block of the NPS; from these the catkins were 
collected in August 1987, 1988, and 1989, and the leaves as well 
in the following two years. The _g_-radiation dose rate in the 
first section was 20-40, in the second 3.0, and in the third 
0.3-0.6 mR/h.

  The concentration of the radionuclides in the structural 
elements of the catkins (seeds, wings, and fruit scales) as well 
as of the leaves was determined individually for each tree. To 
assess the influence of an increased radiation level on the 
catkins, the weight of their structural elements, the seeds, 
wings, and fruit scales was measured. 
  Soil profiles were cut in 1987 and 1988 in the sections 
close 
to Kopachi and Bolshoy Cherevach villages, and soil samples were 
taken. The soil cover on the forest sections examined was 
represented by weakly turfed and humus-enriched sands (pH of the 
aqueous extract was 4.5-5.2;the content of exchangeable Ca, 
1.20-4.09; Mg, 0.33-1.48; K, 0.15-0.36 mg-equ./100 g of soil). A 
more detailed soil and radioecological description of the 
sections was given in preceding papers (Molchanova, et al., 
1990, 1991). 
  The radiocesium content was determined in multichannel 
AMA-02F1 analyzers with semiconductor detectors of the DGDK-50-B 
and DGDK-63A-3 types. The data on the content of [.sup]134[/]Cs 
and [.sup]137[/]Cs are presented summarily for both 
radionuclides. The [.sup]90[/]Sr concentration was measured 
radiochemically on the basis of the daughter [.sup]90[/]Y, the 
radiometry of which was carried out on a low-background UMF-1500 
unit with an SBT-13 end-window counter tube having a counting 
error not greater than 15%. 
  A visual examination was made at the end of July, 1987, of 
selected trees which did not reveal any significant changes in 
the structure of the crowns. However, in some trees in the 
stands located close to the NPS, up to 10-15% of the 
catkins 
were found with a split tip, and the absence of chlorophyll was 
observed in the peripheral parts of the leaf blade. In 
1987-1989, the weight of the seeds and the fruit scales in the 
birch in all of the stands examined were. respectively, 41-45 
and 52-59%, and of the wings, 3-5% of the total 
weight of the 
catkins (table 1). This suggests the absence of an influence of 
the elevated radiation background on the ratio of the weights of 
the individual structural elements of the catkins in these 
stands and, consequently, on the distribution of the 
radionuclides in the crown of the trees.

  The concentration of radioactive cesium in the structural 
elements of the birch catkin decreases as the distance from the 
nuclear station increases (fig. 2). Thus, it was 113 kBq/kg of 
air-dried weight in the seeds from the first stand (15 km from 
the NPS), and respectively 1.5 and 4.5 times less from the 
second and third stands (6 and 18 km from the NPS). At the same 
time, the concentration of radiocesium in the wings and seeds in 
all the stands examined was lower than in the fruit scales. In 
1988 the concentration of this radionuclide increased sharply as 
compared with the preceding year in the seeds and the fruit 
scales in birch in the first stand, while it remained 
substantially unchanged in the other two. In 1989 the content 
of radiocesium was determined in the seeds and leaves, while in 
the trees of the stand that was most remote from the NPS, due to 
the nonharvesting of the seeds, only in the leaves. The 
concentration of [.sup]137[/]Cs in both organs increased in all 
stands as compared with the preceding year, and especially 
strongly in the section close to the nuclear station 
(respectively 1.5-and 4.5-fold). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-95A>      Fig. 2. Content of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in </FIG>


  Calculations showed that on the average 70% of the 
radioactive cesium contained in the catkin is in the fruit 
scales and approximately 25% is in the seeds (table 2). 
Such a 
distribution of radionuclides in the European Birch catkins is 
determined by the higher proportion of the weight of the fruit 
scales in the weight of the catkin and by their greater 
accumulative capacity in relation to radiocesium as compared 
with the seeds and wings.

  Large differences between particular trees with respect to [.sup]134+137 
[/] 
Cs in the structural elements of the catkins 
and leaves are observed in the all the stands examined 
(coefficient of variation ranges from 34 to 90%). 
  The content of [.sup]90[/]Sr, as of radioactive cesium, in 
the structural elements of the birch catkins and leaves 
decreases as the distance from the destroyed block of the NPS 
increases (fig. 3). Thus, in the first stand (Yanov settlement) 
the content of radionuclides in the seeds of the 1987 harvest 
calculated per 1 kg of air-dried weight was 120 kBq; in the 
second and third stands, it was 4.8 and 17.1 times less, 
respectively. A fairly small increase is observed in 1988 in the 
concentration of radiostrontium in the leaves from the trees 
from the first and second stands; however, this is statistically 
insignificant. The concentration of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the 
catkins and leaves increases sharply in 1989 in trees from the 
first stand by contrast with trees from the second stand. The 
average concentration of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the leaves and seeds 
was identical, but the coefficient of correlation between these 
organs with respect to this feature was very low (r = 7.1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-96A>      Fig. 3. Content of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the crowns of European birch trees growing at various distances from </FIG>


  Within the limits of the catkin, the concentration of [.sup]90[/] 

Sr in the seeds was higher as a rule than in the 
fruit scales. However, these differences were statistically 
significant only in the catkins of the 1989 harvest from the 
stand located close to the NPS (t = 4.0 when t[.sub]0.05[/] = 
2.3). In all the stands about 50% of the total amount of 
radiostrontium in the catkin is in the leaves. 
  Significant differences were observed between the trees 
within the limits of each of the stands examined with respect to 
the radiostrontium in the catkins and the leaves: the 
coefficient of variation with respect to this feature ranged 
from 26 to 98%. 
  The ratio of the [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in the structural 
elements of the catkins and leaves in the first three years 
after the accident is mainly in the range of 0.10-0.51 (table 
3), which is close to the ratio of these radionuclides in the 
soil, 0.18-0.42 (table 4). It proved to be very low (0.01-0.04) 
in the seeds and the fruit scales of the trees from the stand 
close to village of B. Cherevach.

  In the forests of the Urals, subjected to radioactive 
contamination due to global fallout, the [.sup]90[/] 
Sr/[.sup]137[/]Cs ratio in 1970 in birch leaves was 
1.26 and 0.13 in the soil; this attests to the more active 
accumulation of radiostrontium by plants from the soil than of 
radiocesium (Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1977). 
  The comparison of the data on the concentration of the 
radionuclides in soils (table 4) and in the birch crown (figs. 
2, 3). It can be seen from table 4 that the concentration of [.sup]90[/] 

Sr and [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in the soils from 
sections close to Kopachi village in 1987 and 1988 is 7-17 and 
15-17 higher than in soils near B. Cherevach village. The 
content of [.sup]90[/]Sr in the crowns (catkins and leaves) is 
40 times higher, while that of [.sup]137[/]Cs is only 3 times 
higher in the trees in the first of these sections. Thus, the 
differences with respect to the average concentration of the 
radionuclides in the crowns of trees growing in different stands 
are disproportional to those in the soil. 
  The results of the investigations presented above suggest 
that in the first three years after the accident at the CNPS, 
the ecologically nonuniform state of the circulation of 
strontium and cesium is characteristic for the forest 
biogeocenoses examined. This is expressed in the increase over 
this period of their concentration in the catkins and leaves and 
in the presence of a substantial disproportion in the content of 
the radionuclides in the plants and the soil from different 
stands. This radioecological situation is determined by the 
relatively short period that has passed following the accident 
at the CNPS in 1986, as well as by the repeated aerial 
contamination of forest stands in 1987 and 1988 that was 
associated with the occurrence of dust storms during the 
carrying out of repair operations at the NPS and the 
deactivation of the territory around it (Blagoev, et al., 1991), 
and with a change in the accessibility of radionuclides for 
woody plants. It should be noted that a decline in [.sup]134[/] 
Cs, due to its radioactive decay (the half-life of [.sup]134[/] 
Cs is 2.08 years), as compared with 1987 in the 
trees and soils, was reflected in the absolute values of the 
concentration of [.sup]134+137[/]Cs in catkins and leaves of 
the collections of 1988 and 1989. 
  The forest stands of the 30-kilometer zone of the accident 
were subjected over the course of 1986-1988 to aerial 
contamination by radioactive substances. If this was associated 
in 1986 mainly with fallout of radionuclides emitted into the 
air from the destroyed reactor, in 1987-1988, as was noted 
above, it was associated with repeated aeolian transport of 
dust. In the year of the accident, the extra-root pathway of the 
entry of [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134+137[/]Cs into the birch 
trees predominated over the root pathway. It is evident that 
during the time following the accident, the contribution of root 
entry increased. However, to assess quantitatively the 
contribution of each of the two pathways to the radioactivity of 
the birch catkins and leaves in the first years following the 
accident, a contribution that depends on many factors, does not 
seem possible. The intensification of root entry of 
radionuclides into the trees is governed by the vertical 
migration of radioactive substances along the soil profile and 
by the increase in the area of contact of the suctorial ends of 
the roots with the contaminated soil (Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 
1977). Repeated aerial contamination of forest stands with 
radioactive dust can retard the processes of stabilization of 
the redistribution of radionuclides between components of 
biogeocenoses, the approximate periods of which under 
experimental conditions reach 10-12 years (Tikhomirov, et al., 
1973; Aleksakhin and Naryshkin, 1977). 
  Our experiments have shown that the generative organs 
(catkins) of the birch accumulate radiostrontium and radiocesium 
in concentrations close to those in the leaves, and, 
consequently, represent an important element in the circulation 
of these radionuclides in forest biogeocenoses in the harvest 
years. The substantial differences between the trees within the 
limits of each of the stands examined with respect to the 
concentration of radionuclides in the catkins and leaves reflect 
the high degree of nonuniformity of the contamination of forest 
sections brought about by the accident at the CNPS and repeated 
aerial transport of emitters with dust.

  [Text] The Vakhsh River valley is a region of intense 
agricultural production, the base of which is cotton 
cultivation. The cultivation of the cotton plant over the last 
three decades has been accompanied by the intensive use of 
pesticides and mineral fertilizers. Some of the toxic agents 
have been carried away from the fields into natural ecosystems. 
Two large chemical enterprises are operating in the Vakhsh River 
basin, the Tadzhikkhimprom production association (TKP PA) and 
the Vakhsh nitrogenous fertilizer plant (VNFP), as well as many 
other industrial enterprises, the exhausts and effluents of 
whose production enter the environment. The level of chemical 
pollution of the Vakhsh River valley ecosystems has been studied 
quite actively; however, studies devoted to the real ecological 
consequences of pollution have been studied considerably less. 
The genetic aspects of chemical pollution of the Vakhsh River 
Valley ecosystems remain essentially unstudied. Some of the 
results obtained at the first stage of the resolution of this 
problem are presented in this paper. 
  In all, 102 mice (Mus musculus) from 13 samples 
were studied. The number of animals in the samples ranged from 
three to eleven; the average size of the samples was eight. The 
sites the mice were trapped with indication of the sample 
number, corresponding to the number on the map (see figure), the 
number of animals trapped, the sex ratio (females : males), and 
the date of trapping are presented below.

  The cytogenetic preparations were made up from bone marrow 
cells (Lee, 1969), and stained with Romanowskys azure-eosin. 
Chromosome injuries were recorded in accordance with 
recommendations set forth in methodological studies (Nemtseva, 
1970; Methods of Analysis..., 1975; Human ChromosomesS, 1985; 
Evans, 1976). The frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in the 
mice from natural populations were compared with the spontaneous 
frequency of aberrations in intact, random-bred laboratory mice. 
The statistical analysis of the data was carried out using the 
one-factor analysis of variance method (Glotov, et al., 1982). 
The investigation results are presented in the table. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-99A>      Chromosomal Aberrations in House Mice in Samples from Natural Populations of the Vakhsh Valley </FIG>


  A large proportion of the samples of the wild mice was taken 
in agricultural fields. The statistical analysis of the results 
obtained suggests a high level of chromosomal disorders in the 
majority of these. In 11 samples out of 13 the frequency of 
chromosomal aberrations was statistically significantly higher 
than in the control at a significance level of 0.001, and in 
one, at 0.01. 
  The chromosomal disorders in mice inhabiting the zone of the 
influence of the industrial discharges of the TKP PA were 
investigated in greater detail. This association produces 
caustic soda, liquid chlorine, hydrogen chloride and fluoride, 
calcium hypochlorite powder, and chlorinated lime. Seven sample 
were studied in this region (Nos. 1-7). In only one of these did 
the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the somatic cells 
not exceed the control value; in the remaining cases the number 
of chromosomal aberrations was statistically significantly 
higher than in the control sample. 
  Six samples were taken south of the Yavan region. In five of 
these the frequency of chromosomal aberrations was significantly 
higher than in the control. The sewer effluents from the cotton 
fields are discharged into many oxbow lakes located on the lower 
courses of Vakhsh. The sewer waters contain pesticides which are 
found in the water, the bottom deposits, and aquatic and 
near-shore vegetation in large quantities. It is entirely 
probable that the high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in 
the mice of samples nos. 8-10 is the result of intense pollution 
of the near-shore biotopes with pesticides. The fish-protective 
measures at the Kuybyshev fish farm have evidently also been 
reflected to some degree in the aberrations in the mice living 
along the shores of ponds; it is lower than in other samples, 
but at the same time statistically significantly higher than the 
spontaneous level of aberrations in the control. The animals of 
samples Nos. 12 and 13 were trapped in cotton fields after a 
period of intensive chemical treatments. Therefore the high 
frequency of aberrations in the mice is entirely understandable. 
In this context, the low frequency of aberrations in sample No. 
11, also taken in a cotton field, is somewhat unexpected. We 
were unable to establish the intensity of the chemical 
treatments of the latter. It is possible that the low frequency 
of aberrations is the consequence of the introduction in 
particular farms of integrated and biological methods of 
combating cotton pests. The low frequency of disorders in sample 
No. 11 is probably the result of its small size. We were unable 
to increase the size of this sample. 
  The data we obtained suggest that the intensity of the 
mutational process is significantly increased in wild rodents at 
the existing level of chemical pollution of the Vakhsh valley. 
Chromosomal aberrations probably arise with similar intensity in 
the cells of other mammals. Extrapolating the information 
obtained to the human population of the Vakhsh valley, the 
existence of a real danger of an increase in hereditary diseases 
among the population must be hypothesized. These data once again 
underscore the necessity of conducting constant genetic 
monitoring, both of natural populations of plants and animals, 
and of human populations as well, in the cotton-sowing regions 
of the republic.

  [Text]Many years of industrial construction in Russia 
without comprehensive scientific work on the set of problems 
that determine the optimum impact of use of technologies on the 
environment and man have led society to the knowledge of many 
facts of the devastating effect on the environment and public 
health of economic activities in various industrially developed 
regions, now that the press has more freedom. 
  According to data in an annual dealing with atmospheric 
pollution in cities of the Russian Federation, more than 40 
cities are named in the list of cities with a high level of air 
pollution. 
  Many hygienic research developments and data of WHO have 
shown that there is a distinct correlation between level and 
frequency of exposure to pollutants, morbidity and health status 
of people residing in such an environment [1-6, 9, 10]. 
  The extent of manifestation of negative consequences of 
anthropogenic transformations of the environment is so great 
that, at present, there can be no question of simultaneous and 
comprehensive solution of the problem of improving and 
optimizing the stricken environment. We need to have validated 
routes for implementing in stages engineering, economic, social 
and medical measures in this direction. Laying scientific and 
methodological foundations for special mapping should be 
considered as one of the mechanisms for such control of this 
process. 
  Originally, ecological-hygienic mapping, as a system of 
reflecting quantitatively and qualitatively the sanitary 
situation that has actually developed as a result of 
anthropogenic activities in a specific region, was elaborated at 
the Novosibirsk affiliate of the Hygiene and Occupational 
Pathology Scientific Production Association, with involvement of 
specialists in different fields of knowledge of the Siberian 
Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences [7], and in 
subsequent years it was further developed at the Moscow Research 
Institute of Hygiene imeni F. F. Erisman and other research 
institutions. The value of such mapping to the national economy, 
from the standpoint of environmental and health protection, lies 
in the fact (provided information is reliable) that it permits 
differentiated presentation of the severity of 
ecological-hygienic disturbances in the objects of 
investigation, forecasting future development of negative 
tendencies, determination with some degree of reliability of the 
most dangerous ``hot'' spots of environmental impact, and then 
to plan adequate effective measures for immediate and long-term 
implementation. Obtaining complete and reliable information is a 
difficult aspect of such ``ground-based'' multifactor mapping 
(geographic position, aerometeorological distinctions, 
concentration of industry, its composition, conditions of 
formation of fields of environmental pollution, potential for 
atmospheric pollution, self-purification processes, resettling 
of workers -- guidelines and their implementation, criteria of 
the burdens on the environment, health status and morbidity of 
the public, and many others). This applies, first of all, to 
quantitative and qualitative assessment of industrial sources of 
environmental pollution. 
  We know that, at the present time, there is far from 
accurate 
registration or inventorying of industrial enterprises, in the 
absence of reliable devices (automated or semi-automated) for 
recording the toxic components of waste contained directly in 
the smoke plume. Consequently, reliability of forecasting on the 
basis of this indicator of technogenic impact is also relative. 
  On the one hand, the correlation between overall impact of 
toxic substances on public health has been established for 
marked contrasts and, on the other hand, it does not have an 
adequate scientific foundation when exogenous factors are of low 
intensity. 
  Evidently, it is worthwhile to also mention that so-called 
mobile sources -- exhaust from various means of transportation 
-- present a serious problem with respect to assessing the 
multifactor impact. We cannot fail to mention the capabilities 
of laboratory monitoring of environmental pollution which are 
presently based on methods of chemical assay that are not 
accurate or selective enough. High-precision physical monitoring 
methods and supply of modern instruments in different 
localities, even in hygienic research institutions, are being 
adopted too slowly. From the standpoint of enhancing forecast 
quality and, accordingly, recommended means of tactical 
interaction in a positive direction of development of the 
national economy, it is important to accurately assess the 
potential for pollution released by the soil and vegetation 
accumulated in the course of long-term operation of enterprises, 
which usually have obsolete technology, as a result of 
desorption by toxic substances, often already transformed in the 
environment, from the surface of buildings and installations, 
and the probability of their secondary negative impact on all 
living things within the limits of artificially created 
geochemical territories. 
  There are grounds to discuss the fact that, with all the 
benefit of developing and using modern hygienic mapping, at 
present it is deemed desirable to direct efforts, as much as 
possible, toward upgrading this important direction of national 
economic, sociohygienic and ecological research. Aerial mapping 
from outer space, as a large-scale additional element of 
``terrestrial'' mapping, may be viewed as an important one of 
these informative procedures that are on the front lines of our 
science. 
  What would we like to gain from the use of this 
methodological procedure and what we can expect of it, in view 
of the fact that space engineering is, as a rule, considerably 
ahead of the capabilities of ``terrestrial measurements'' from 
the standpoint of hygiene? 
  First of all, with the high resolution of the equipment, it 
is realistic to expect obtaining precise data on the range of 
pollution of a given industrially developed territory as a 
result of long-term settling of toxic constituents of discharged 
waste on the earth's surface. 
  Special emphasis should be placed on the fact that the first 
joint work with the research center for space ecology indicates 
that, as of the present time, the main characteristics of the 
technogenic burden on a specific territory, as ``seen'' from 
space, are in the form of distinctly circumscribed spots 
differing in intensity. Technically, it is possible to obtain 
cross-sections of such a spot according to saturation density at 
any specified altitude, starting virtually with the earth's 
superficial layer. 
  At present it is extremely important for space engineering 
to 
enable us to determine the differences in extent of involvement 
of the environment of a given part of a city, a region, not only 
according to intensity and density of the smoke cloud, but also 
according to composition of main and permanent elements of urban 
pollution -- sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon 
monoxide, heavy metals, etc. The intensity and qualitative 
composition of the smoke ``plume'' traveling in the wind 
direction would enable us to compare the findings of ground- 
based studies (laboratory, forecasts, mathematical) to values 
recorded from space, which would have a direct influence on 
reliability of data and, of course, help enhance the quality of 
work carried out everywhere in the direction of ecology and 
hygiene. We believe that, to some extent, such studies will help 
define the optimum locations for permanent observation stations 
for monitoring actual industrial pollution levels in residential 
parts of urban regions. They could have a substantial impact on 
development of forecasting of significance of spread of 
pollutants, which is used extensively in the form of an 
effective method of calculating the scatter of waste in the 
atmosphere (OND-86) in industrial construction plans [8]. 
  Determination of pollutants differing in saturation over the 
entire potential range of pollution of a region under study, 
which is done under ordinary conditions in isolated cases by 
very labor-intensive work, for example, metallometric 
photography, would make it possible to correctly ``trigger'' the 
mechanism for adopting the most effective measures to 
``correct'' the developed adverse situation locally in a given 
region. 
  And there is one more important factor. Because of two-way 
definition and refinement of methodological approaches to 
terrestrial and space monitoring in order to enhance reliability 
of indicators of technogenic pollution of a residential region, 
one can expect with confidence that ongoing and dynamic 
ground-based monitoring of the sanitary condition of the urban 
environment, which is very expensive, could be handed over 
entirely (with great informativeness) to space monitoring. 
  Within the same approach, one could develop an enlarged 
scale,comprising the intensity of pollution spot coloration and 
concentrations of main and overall pollutants; on the basis of 
this scale, objectively validated territories differing in 
degree of pollution of the environment, zones of biologically 
hazardous existence, etc., could be charted with utmost 
reliability on the map of Russia. 
  In this regard, it is hoped that the representative positive 
experience in determining correlations between intensity of 
pollution according to darkness of the spot from space and data 
on demography and morbidity pertaining thus far only to one 
nosological form, involvement of respiratory organs, would make 
it possible to formulate and solve on a global scale the problem 
of defining the order and urgency of development of protective 
steps. It would be desirable to use, along with the data from 
space mapping, those obtained from ground-based hygienic 
mapping, medical statistics and clinical studies, which would 
make it possible to create in cartography a scientific 
classification of ecological-hygienic zoning. 
  Such an approach would have a substantial effect on solving 
a 
number of problems. It will become possible for the State to 
allocate funds in a purposeful way with scientific validation 
for environmental protection (at the expense of fines imposed on 
enterprises and local budget), first of all in the most 
hazardous polluted regions for the purpose of ongoing and rapid 
amelioration. As a mandatory prerequisite in plans for 
socio-economic development of specific regions, closure of 
particularly hazardous industries and plants, and implementation 
of radical reconstruction of enterprises with adoption of 
modern, progressive waste-free or minimum-waste technologies 
within time periods coordinated in each individual case, would 
be an objective argument against further build-up of the 
industrial potential within a specific, limited polluted 
territory. In order to comprehend the sociohygienic situation, 
an accurate ``view from the top'' would permit objective 
evaluation of biologically possible or impossible further 
resettling of workers in a given region as a whole and as 
applied to each major urban region. Just as important, and 
perhaps even more important, is objective determination of 
optimum times, from the standpoint of safeguarding public 
health, for implementation of long-term programs, developed with 
the participation of hygienists, for improving living 
conditions, measures to improve the health of the public in each 
specific city, rayon, and region; the established ranges of 
migration of technogenic impurities when waste is discharged 
through ultratall smokestacks would permit consideration of the 
internationally important matter of migration of pollutants 
across frontiers from the territory of our State to adjacent 
countries. Appropriate mapping of dynamic features of this 
process would also permit solving the problem of lowering the 
intensity of directional flow and improving the existing 
situation. 
  Of basic importance is the question of correlation between 
factors of environmental pollution and health indictors. One can 
advance to quantitative forecasting of health indicators, 
including morbidity indicators, by establishing, with use of 
hygienic monitoring, the quantitative correlation between the 
integral sanitary description of the environment and indicators 
of health status of different age-sex and social groups -- 
physical development, functional (including immunological) 
deviations, morbidity (most frequently determined according to 
frequency of seeking medical attention) and mortality rates. 
From the standpoint of hygiene, when monitoring public health it 
is important to organize records of premorbid states 
(prenosological diagnoses), first of all among the child 
population, on the basis of analysis of results of periodic 
physicals. 
  It will be necessary to devote particular attention to 
forecasting morbidity related to the negative influence of 
environment polluting factors, development and determination of 
integral pollution indicators and priority pollutants, detection 
of groups, territories and diseases at risk, keeping records of 
social, environmental and other factors. 
  Bearing this in mind, it is imperative to immediately 
integrate ground- based information obtained in the course of 
ground-based hygienic mapping, which includes not only data on 
pollutants, but also on their effect on human health, with the 
maps plotted from space of changes in transparency of the 
atmosphere, and to develop methods for such integration, which 
should conform accurately enough both to the capabilities of 
terrestrial and space monitoring, and to the goal of solving the 
most pressing problems of protecting the environment and human 
health, i.e., we are referring to involvement of health care 
agencies in the system of ecological-hygienic ground-based and 
space monitoring, on the basis of using modern technology, 
knowledge in environmental hygiene and mathematical methods. 
  Thus, refinement of a reliable enough ground-based and space 
method of monitoring and ranking, which would permit not only 
ecological hygienic zoning of the country, but also systematic 
ongoing information about changing situations in order to 
control the quality of the environment on the broadest scale in 
the interests of public health, is the principal factor, from 
the standpoint of science and practice, in development of this 
direction of research.

  [Text]Present-day life in our country is characterized, on 
the one hand, by a complicated economic situation, a serious lag 
behind progressive nations of the world in the area of 
scientific-engineering and technological decisions, and, on the 
other hand, exacerbation of the ecological situation, and 
absence of appropriate steps to protect the environment. In 
other words, the socioeconomic situation in the Russian 
Federation is characterized by absence of stable development and 
viable environment. 
  In the Central Volga Region, there is a considerable 
concentration of industry, concentration and integration of 
agriculture and urbanization. The priority industrial sectors 
are oil refining and petrochemistry, the chemical industry, 
vehicle manufacture, and power engineering with multifactored 
formation of working conditions, attraction toward superficial 
sources of water, first of all the Volga River, with the great 
demand for water of technological processes, considerable amount 
of polluted sewage and discharge of waste into the atmosphere. 
All this has led to intensification of anthropogenic impact on 
the environment (water, atmospheric air), more complicated 
relations between man and the environment, and worsening of 
working conditions at industrial enterprises, which made it 
necessary to develop at the Samara affiliate several scientific 
directions of hygienic research, both basic and applied, on 
problems of ``Scientific bases of environmental hygiene,'' and 
``Scientific bases of industrial hygiene and occupational 
pathology,'' with development and reinforcement of ties with 
practical health care. 
  We are referring, first of all, to investigation of the link 
between condition of the natural and industrial environment, on 
the one hand, and health of the population of the Central Volga 
Region, on the other hand, with determination of cause and 
effect relationship between environmental factors and human 
health, patterns of formation of human health and elaboration of 
scientific bases for primary prevention of morbidity. 
  Regression-correlation functions have been established 
between incidence among children of neoplasms, acute pneumonia, 
chronic bronchitis, congenital abnormalities, allergies and 
level of atmospheric pollution, both by individual chemicals and 
the sum thereof. The demonstrated nature of morbidity, as well 
as prenosological changes in the physical condition of children 
were similar and unrelated to the type of industry or specific 
pollutants. Prepathological changes were manifested in the form 
of diminished pulmonary ventilation, diminished functional 
capacity of the nervous system (extended latency period of 
oculomotor response), cardiovascular system (reduced stroke 
volume with exercise), and depression of B-system of immunity 
(low titer of heterophil antibodies in saliva). The effect of 
pollutants was assessed with consideration of their combined 
effect on health on the order of partial summation. The 
demonstrated changes in health status of children served as the 
main criterion for assessing hygienic efficacy of 
water-protective measures at oil-refining and petrochemical 
enterprises. 
  On the basis of methodological procedures developed at this 
affiliate, it was established that the priority anthropogenic 
chemical pollutants in Volga water reservoirs (Volgograd, 
Kuybyshev), which are sources of drinking water supplied to the 
public, have an adverse effect on human health. There was a rise 
in noninfectious morbidity, with a shift of maximum values to a 
younger age, and impairment of female reproductive function. 
  Determination was made of quantitative characteristics of 
the 
link between level of chemical pollution of reservoir water and 
drinking water, on the one hand, and morbidity among the 
inhabitants of the regions studied. There was a close 
correlation between the toxic potential of water and diseases of 
the nervous system and sense organs, genitourinary disease, 
allergies, skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue diseases. It was 
shown that chemicals with first and second class hazard rating 
contained in drinking water made the chief contribution to 
formation of morbidity among the public. 
  Establishment of a link between presence in water of 
anthropogenic chemical pollutants and public health made it 
necessary to refine methods for assessing the quality of water 
in superficial sources. Along with means, we used analysis of 
degree of deviation of parameters of anthropogenic chemicals 
from the standard in order to assess the sanitary condition of 
Volga reservoirs. Data on seasonal averages and, particularly, 
mean concentrations over periods of many years of pollutants are 
smoothed by the sanitary situation of a reservoir and do not 
necessarily inform the health inspector accurately about the 
real danger of pollution to health of the public, and they 
merely indicate the minimal possible hazard. 
  In-depth analysis of morbidity involving temporary work 
incapacity (TWI], course of gestation period and parturition in 
more than 45,000 female workers, investigation of infant health 
in the early neonatal period revealed that the problem of labor 
safety for female workers (operators, laboratory technicians) 
exposed to a set of toxic factors, and health protection for the 
next generation is left virtually unsolved at enterprises of the 
chemical industry (Tolyatti, Chapayevsk). Interruption of 
pregnancy occurred most often at the early stages of gestation 
and mainly among those who had little work tenure (47.7 percent 
of the cases for operators and 55.3 percent for laboratory 
technicians). In view of the frequent miscarriages, the mean age 
of women at the time of birth of their first child is 23.8 years 
for operators and 24.3 for laboratory technicians. In general, 
women who are pregnant should not be hired as laboratory 
technicians or come in contact with toxic agents for the 
duration of pregnancy. Total days of TWI during pregnancy 
constituted 9843, which is tantamount to stopping production 
involving 400 female workers. Various chemicals are found in 
biological media of pregnant women (blood, placenta, perifetal 
water, milk): dimethyl formamide, toluene, dioxins. 
  Impaired neonatal homeostasis causes birth of children with 
low birth weight. Intrauterine fetal hypotrophy constituted 15 
percent. Penetration of toxic agents into fetal blood leads to 
development of defects in various locations. Combined 
developmental defects are not uncommon, and they constitute 36.1 
percent among neonates of Chapayevsk. In premature fetuses, as 
well as spontaneously aborted fetuses there are gross 
development defects and their incidence is 50.8 percent. 
  The results of the study indicate that there is an urgent 
need for a legislative solution to the matter of procedure for 
granting authorized leave at the early stages of pregnancy to 
women employed in chemical enterprises, as well as preferential 
pension benefits for women working as ``laboratory 
technicians,'' and adding the latter to the list of occupations 
in which work is not allowed during pregnancy. 
  Analysis of morbidity involving TWI among workers at motor 
vehicle plants (VAZ, KamAZ) revealed that acute respiratory 
infections are in first place in the morbidity structure of 
these two plants, diseases of the musculoskeletal system and 
connective tissue (osteochondrosis) are in third place; this is 
related, in the former case, to the adverse epidemiological 
situation observed in recent years, as well as (in the latter 
case) to work in uncomfortable, contrived positions. In second 
place is hypertensive disease at VAZ and acute tonsillitis, sore 
throat and pharyngitis at KamAZ. These differences can be 
attributed to the greater intensity and stress of work at VAZ, 
and this has been taken into consideration in elaborating 
hygienic recommendations to optimize working conditions. 
  The increased importance of the chemical factor and its 
effect on human health have determined the direction of work in 
the field of preventive toxicology: development of sanitary 
standards for toxic substances (PDK [maximum permissible 
concentration], OBUV [approximate safe level of a substance]) in 
environmental objects and work zones, expert toxicological 
evaluation of new chemical compounds introduced to the national 
economy and everyday life. This involved the use of modern 
methods for faster standard setting, studies of pathogenetic 
aspects of intoxication (lipid peroxidation, condition of 
cardiovascular system), long-term and deferred effects, use of 
mathematical models. Existing standards continue to be a 
reliable foundation for maintaining optimum conditions in the 
work environment, preserving purity of water sources and the 
urban air environment. 
  Work on upgrading sanitary legislation was activated because 
of the increasing anthropogenic effect on the environment (water 
reservoirs, air) of the Central Volga Region, tense 
sociohygienic situation at enterprises in cities of this region, 
and poor tendencies as to working conditions on the main 
assembly conveyers. Many thousands of workers engaged in 
assembling passenger vehicles and trucks using mechanized 
instruments are exposed to the combined effect of a set of 
deleterious industrial factors: different combinations of noise, 
local vibration, toxic agents, monotony, static and 
nervous-emotional stress. Cases of vibration sickness have been 
recorded among the workers; the incidence of musculoskeletal 
pathology and other diseases involving TWI is growing. There has 
been no decline in personnel turnover related to unsatisfactory 
nature and conditions of work. 
  Consequently, the Sanitary Rules for Working on the Main 
Assembly Conveyers in Motor Vehicle Plants, a draft of which was 
developed in 1991, are important. Analogous developments remain 
timely for other sectors of machine building. 
  With the increase in anthropogenic burden on water sources 
and change in most important pollutants, there has been a 
decline in practical value of State standards for sources of 
water supply and drinking water because of the incomplete 
record-keeping and use in sanitary surveillance practice of 
indicators of organic and specific chemical pollution, 
diminished importance of indicator microorganisms. In 
particular, it was noted in studies at the Volga reservoirs that 
bacteria in the E. coli group provide much information for 
assessing water quality and direction of self-purification 
processes, as compared to their lactose-positive variants. In 
this regard, research is both interesting and necessary for 
development of rating criteria of water quality and patterns of 
water source self-purification processes as related to the prime 
pollutant, ecological-hygienic system for rating water quality, 
refinement of sanitary-chemical methods of monitoring water 
quality in supply sources (on the example of the Volga 
reservoirs). 
  Joint work with practical health care agencies in oblasts 
supported by the Samara affiliate (Samara, Ulyanov, Penza) 
remains an important element in carrying out research work. The 
nature of relations between the research institute and practical 
institutions of the SES [sanitary- epidemiological service] has 
changed radically in recent times. Territorial SESs have equal 
rights to work on scientific projects as subcontractors. This 
serves as a foundation for carrying out such labor-intensive 
studies as investigation of the health status of the public as a 
function of environmental pollution, it is instrumental in more 
effective and reliable practical implementation of hygienic and 
ameliorative recommendations. 
  Data on the socioeconomic development of the Central Volga 
Region and results of studies of recent years indicate that 
further intensification is needed for hygienic research to avert 
the negative impact of environmental and industrial factors on 
the health of the people. 
  An applied direction is related to the continued search for 
evidence of a link between the public's health and nature and 
intensity of work zone pollution. But only development of basic 
research, full disclosure of the pathogenesis of reactions of 
both individuals and the population to chemical pollutants will 
enable us to single out the high risk groups, elaborate the 
scientific bases for clinical supervision and come closer to 
controlling the health of the people. 
  In future studies, which are closely related to the priority 
direction, it is planned to develop and refine the guidelines 
for hygienic monitoring of environmental objects in order to 
optimize it, improve organization and performance of analytical 
monitoring of levels of priority chemical pollutants in 
environmental and industrial objects, identify the mechanisms of 
the adverse effects of industrial factors on the health of 
workers, improve hygienic regulation of chemicals, the combined, 
integral and associated effect on the body of deleterious 
environmental and industrial factors.

Department of Social Medicine, Economics and Public Health 
Administration, Kazan Institute for the Advanced Training of 
Physicians imeni V. I. Lenin, and the Republic Clinical 
Hospital, Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Health; UDC 
658.387.003.1] 
  [Text] The new economic mechanism of managing the public 
health system based on economic methods began with experiments 
conducted in 1988 in St. Petersburg and in Kemerovo and Samara 
oblasts. Study of the results of this experiment, analysis of 
available literature and familiarization with the principles of 
organizing and managing a public health system in a number of 
countries and republics permitted us to develop our own concept 
for transition of a large multiprofile treatment and diagnosis 
complex, such as the Republic Clinical Hospital, to economic 
methods of management and administration. Two basic principles 
were laid at the basis of this concept: first, the principle of 
raising the level and quality of medical assistance provided to 
patients, achieved by way of a new mechanism of planning, 
financing, administering and controlling the quality of the 
treatment and diagnosis process, and evaluating the activity of 
the entire hospital as a whole and each of each structural 
subdivisions; second, the principle of fundamentally changing 
the hospital's financing to settling accounts with each cured 
patient rather than allocating a budget for the entire year. 
  Three basic stages can be clearly delineated in the 
practical 
implementation of this concept. The first stage (preparatory) 
embraced the period up to April 1991. It included economic 
training for physicians and secondary medical personnel in a 
program set up by us, study of existing experience, development 
of our own variant of clinical-statistical groups and the 
principles of settling mutual accounts and of medical and 
financial document turnover, and calculation of the cost of 
medical services. 
  Clinical-statistical groups were formed by the directors and 
physicians of the hospital's departments on the basis of an 
analysis of the structure of hospital morbidity over the 3 
preceding years. By breaking down the diagnostic and treatment 
process into days of the patient's hospital stay, we were able 
to create flow charts on the basis of which a list of prices of 
medical services was formed. 
  The new functional interrelationships between clinical 
departments, the hospital statistical service, the automated 
control system division, the planning and financial division and 
the accounting office brought about the need for making certain 
changes in the official accounting forms used in statistical and 
financial document turnover, and for developing the procedures 
of working with these documents. 
  The first stage of introducing the economic mechanism of 
management had as its result an agreement between the Ministry 
of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Republic Clinical 
Hospital, as well as agreements between the administration and 
the hospital's departments. According to the agreement the 
Republic Clinical Hospital obligated itself to organize 
treatment and diagnosis in the hospital's departments and in the 
polyclinic, and consultative and emergency aid in the rayons, 
through the efforts of its associates and at a certain level of 
work quality. In the meantime the Health Ministry will provide 
financing to the Republic Clinical Hospital for each patient who 
is cured or receives consultation in accordance with a price 
list, and with regard for the treatment results. As an 
attachment to the agreement we determined the quantitative and 
qualitative indicators embracing all aspects of the hospital's 
diverse activity. Attainment of these indicators meant full 
financing of the hospital's work; when certain of them were not 
met, penalties went into effect on the basis of mutual financial 
settlements. Fulfillment of agreements between the hospital 
administration and the individual services was organized in 
similar fashion. 
  A system of monitoring treatment quality was developed; a 
commission to summarize quarterly results of fulfilling the 
agreement was approved by an order of the hospital's chief 
physician. 
  Work under the agreements (the second stage of introducing 
the new economic mechanism of management) with the departments 
and services within the hospital made it possible in 1991 to 
upgrade the quality and intensity of the work of the personnel, 
to materially reinforce the personal responsibility of each 
medical worker for the end results of both his own labor and the 
labor of the entire department, and to do away with ``leveling'' 
of wages. 
  It must be emphasized that the Republic Clinical Hospital 
fulfilled its agreed obligations completely on the basis of the 
work results for 1991. Intensification of the work of the 
services and of all associates made it possible to reduce the 
average daily time of a patient's occupancy of a bed in the 
hospital as a whole, as a result of which around an additional 
6,000 patients received hospital care, which was over 25 percent 
of the total number of hospitalized patients stipulated in the 
agreement. The number of inhabitants of the republic's rayons in 
the hospital was 60.7 percent (the planned indicator was 60 
percent). 
  The work quality of the associates improved, and contracted 
obligations were fulfilled and surpassed. This was reflected in 
the hospital's financial activity. Under the new conditions of 
management the hospital earned an additional 12.5 percent of 
funds over what was planned by the budget. According to the 
results for 1991, the wages of hospital associates generally 
increased by an average of 40 percent in comparison with what 
they received in March 1991. During 1991 the hospital also 
provided medical services on the basis of direct contracts with 
enterprises and institutions, as well as through health 
insurance companies. 
  The second stage of introducing economic methods of 
management ended with summarization of the results of fulfilling 
the agreement on joint work by the Republic Clinical Hospital 
and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan in 1991. 
The results achieved by the Republic Clinical Hospital became an 
object of business-like and incisive discussion at a meeting of 
the board of the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Health on 26 
February 1992, at which the principles of organizing our work 
were approved. In courses organized by the training center, 
directors of public health institutions in the republic's cities 
and rayons, their deputies, economists, accountants and 
department directors were acquainted with the system and 
sequence of organizing the efforts of the Republic Clinical 
Hospital to prepare for and accomplish the transition to 
economic methods of management. 
  The accumulated experience allowed us to account for issues 
left unresolved in the preceding stages when we signed an 
agreement with the Ministry of Health for 1992. Thus, the 
clinical-statistical groups were reexamined, and consideration 
was given in them to the particular features of the course and 
nature of disease treatment and to presence of accompanying 
illnesses and complications, which brought about the need for 
differentiating the prices. Expert evaluation sheets were drawn 
up for the purpose of evaluating the completeness of the set of 
therapeutic measures and the quality of treatment rendered to 
each patient. Use of these sheets will make it possible to carry 
out three-stage control of quality and make an integral 
evaluation of it. Thus we have been in the third stage of the 
work since the beginning of 1992--introducing the contract form 
of labor organization and wages for the hospital administration 
and department directors. 
  The preliminary results of using the new economic methods of 
management in the Republic Clinical Hospital were as follows: 
The attitude toward patients changed--the patient became a 
desired guest in the minds of the hospital, the physicians and 
all medical personnel; in addition interest appeared in curing a 
larger number of patients with better quality of treatment. And 
it is the latter that determines the wages received both in the 
different structural subdivisions of the hospital and by 
individual associates for the real results of their concrete 
work.

<F P=106> [Article by I. S. Abdullin, Kazan Public Health </F>
Administration; UDC 614.2:616-058.9:352] 
  [Text] The health of the population takes shape under the 
influence of a large number of socioeconomic, ecological, 
behavioral and biological factors. It depends directly on the 
state of the public health system in only 10 percent of cases. 
Despite this, public health often assumes the responsibility for 
maintaining and strengthening public health. 
  A large number of alarming trends have revealed themselves 
in 
recent years in the health of the city's residents. For example 
in 1992 the birth rate dropped to 10.2 per 1,000 population, 
while mortality grew to 10.5. Natural growth is 0.3 per 1,000 
population, and it is exhibiting a tendency of further decline. 
We have thus encountered depopulation of the capital of the 
Republic of Tatarstan for the first time. Growth is noted in the 
incidence of malignant neoplasms from 296 per 100,000 population 
in 1986 to 317.5 in 1992. The frequency of their neglect 
increased significantly during this period as well (from 17.2 to 
30.2 percent). Cancer mortality grew correspondingly from 210.0 
in 1986 to 228.5 in 1992 per 100,000 population. 
  A tendency for growth in incidence of tuberculosis, 
including 
the active form, and of mental diseases, syphilis, drug 
addiction and toxic substance abuse is observed. 
  A certain tendency for decline of both overall morbidity and 
incidence of illnesses can be discerned in the presence of 
significant growth of mortality. This paradox is apparently 
explained by a decrease in the frequency of the people's visits 
to medical institutions, a drop in infectious morbidity, and in 
part, flaws in accounting and reporting. Special mention should 
be made of the paradoxical three-time decrease in incidence of 
alcoholism on the backdrop of a drop in alcoholism control 
efforts and growth of the volume of alcoholic beverages consumed. 
  In describing the health of the population of Kazan we would 
like to dwell specially on the health of women of child-bearing 
age, children and adolescents, which allows us to predict the 
health of future generations to some degree. The health index of 
children in their first year of life is decreasing with every 
year; it is only 24.1 percent. Infant morbidity has been 
observed to grow from 1,788 cases in 1986 to 2,245 cases in 1992 
per 1,000 population of the corresponding age, while the number 
of dispensary patients decreased during this period from 279 per 
1,000 population to 277. Health indicators are also worsening 
among schoolchildren. 
  The health of adolescents--both boys and girls--evokes 
alarm. 
In the last 5 years the incidence of illness among adolescent 
girls has increased, and one of every three suffers some 
disease. In some of the city's rayons 50 percent of the young 
girls are found to have extragenital diseases. Thus the 
reproductive function of the future generation is in danger, 
because healthy children are born only from healthy parents. 
  Today the health of the female population of Kazan evokes 
serious concern. Maternal mortality was 46.7 per 100,000 live 
births in the city in 1992. Almost 50 percent of pregnant women 
suffer extragenital diseases. Only 12 percent of women use 
contraceptives (60-80 percent do so in civilized countries). 
This is obviously why there are three abortions for every birth, 
and why the quantity of complications following abortions has 
increased. 
  Sixty percent of women are employed in Kazan's industrial 
enterprises in jobs exposing them to harmful production factors. 
This situation has led to growth in occupational diseases among 
women, and the number of premature births and spontaneous 
abortions has increased. 
  We are also troubled by the fact that strange as it may seem 
at first glance, the health of the population is continuing to 
worsen as the availability of physicians to the population has 
increased from 37.8 in 1986 to 38.3 in 1992, and on the backdrop 
of relative improvement of the material and equipment base of 
public health institutions. 
  Today the city has 59 hospitals with 16,890 beds; of this 
number, 42 hospitals with 9,050 beds are under the Public Health 
Administration. There are 159 beds per 10,000 population (the 
norm is 139). There are 82 outpatient polyclinic institutions in 
the city fitted out with modern endoscopic equipment and 
ultrasonic units. 
  Despite the extensive network of therapeutic and preventive 
institutions in the city, their construction is continuing: A 
ward with a capacity of 240 beds was built by the construction 
and installation division of the Tasma Production Association, 
and erection is under way of a rehabilitation ward for City 
Hospital No. 16, a multiprofile hospital with 800 beds, a 
pediatric multiprofile hospital with 300 beds, and so on. 
  The material and equipment base of therapeutic and 
preventive 
institutions is also improving due to reconstruction of existing 
institutions. Overhaul and reconstruction were carried out in 
1992 in 27 therapeutic institutions; however, the results of our 
labor are more modest today than they were 5-6 years ago. A 
declining interest in conscientious work and a decrease in the 
level of professionalism of medical workers are playing a major 
role here. The residual principle of financing may be included 
in another group of causes. Rather than 6-10 percent of gross 
national income, we have actually allocated two to three times 
less. Hence the low wages and the insufficient supply of medical 
equipment, medicines and instruments in therapeutic and 
preventive institutions. Mention should also be made of the 
former presence of serious shortcomings in public health 
planning. Our principal indicators, you see, were the number of 
visits and fulfillment of the bed-days plan; financing was 
provided depending on these indicators, with no relationship to 
the end results. Therefore the number of hospital beds per 
capita is twice greater than in developed countries. However, 
this indicator has no direct bearing upon the health of 
patients, because in many ways the effectiveness of treatment is 
determined by the availability of medical equipment and 
pharmaceuticals. Given the current situation in public health, 
we need to take immediate steps to improve medical support to 
the city's population. 
  In what directions is reform of the city public health 
system 
foreseen? 
  The main direction is transition of the city's public health 
system to new economic mechanisms of management, coupled with 
further practical introduction of budget-supported insured 
health care into the work of therapeutic institutions. This will 
make it possible to upgrade the quality of health care, and to 
make effective and sensible use of human, material and financial 
resources, which in my opinion will have a positive effect on 
the health of the city's population. 
  With the transition to new economic methods of 
administration 
and to budget-supported insured health care, personnel training 
has important significance. Considering this circumstance, we 
intend to raise the professional level of doctors by organizing 
their training and subsequent licensing and certification to 
engage in a particular activity. We are thinking about raising 
the role and prestige of outpatient and polyclinic institutions 
by establishing multiprofile outpatient therapeutic and 
preventive associations that will include women's consultation 
offices and children's polyclinics supported by day hospitals. A 
medical institution acquires prestige only when it is able to 
render specialized care. This is why we need to give proper 
credit to the many executives who are working hard to create 
specialized centers. Naturally, they are finding support from 
the Public Health Administration, because we see their efforts 
as being extremely promising. 
  Development of the independence and initiative of labor 
collectives is an important factor for improving medical 
support. When it comes to obstetric care, we feel it necessary 
to integrate the service into the general public health 
structure: We need to erect maternity hospitals as a part of 
multiprofile hospitals, and organize provision of health care by 
general practice and family practice physicians. 
  Thus we can determine the following directions for reform of 
the city's public health system: 

  -  regular (systematic) scientific forecasting of trends in 
public health, and determination of adequate priority directions 
in the system's development; 
  -  forced introduction of economic 
methods of public health administration at all levels of medical 
services; 
  -  integration of the activity of individual specialized 
services, 
centers and structural subdivisions with an orientation on 
attaining the end result and an effective relationship to 
science; 
  -  priority development of multiprofile outpatient polyclinic 
institutions, with an accent on the preventive orientation of 
their work; 
  -  maximum sensible and highly effective use of available public 
health resources; 
  -  significant upgrading of the quality of health care by 
intensive training of personnel, by establishing proper 
conditions for their work, by increasing the amount of resource 
support to hospitals and polyclinics, and by stimulating good 
work results. 

    The objective of reaching the average European health 
standards may be posed with full justification today before the 
Kazan city public health system. This is to be the main goal and 
strategy of the development of this city's public health in the 
immediate future, and possibly in the more remote future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kazakh Republic Deputy Minister of Health M. </F>
Kulzhanov by correspondent M. Ambartsumyan; date and place of 
interview not given; UDC 368.06: ``Budget-Supported Health 
Insurance--the Will of the Day''] 
  [Text] The matter of the draft law of the Kazakh Republic 
``On Health Insurance for Citizens'' (second reading) was 
placed, among other issues, on the agenda of the 10th Session of 
the Kazakh Republic Supreme Soviet. Our correspondent M. 
Ambartsumyan interviews Deputy Minister of Health M. Kulzhanov 
on what health insurance includes, and what the limits of its 
possibilities are. 
[Ambartsumyan]Maksut Karimovich, many readers have 
gained the impression that budget-supported health insurance is 
a panacea for all economic ills in public health. 
[Kulzhanov]That's far from so. According to 
calculations by economists of the republic's Ministry of Health, 
this form of providing health care will help to ease the 
difficulties that accumulated over the entire existence of the 
former public health system by a maximum of only 30 percent. 
  Let me begin with the basic program of budget-supported 
insured medicine, which includes a guaranteed volume of all 
forms of ordinary health care (with the exception of specialized 
care provided to tubercular and oncological patients), AIDS 
centers, children's sanatoriums, dairy kitchena, blood 
transfusion stations, cardiac surgery, grafts and 
transplantations of tissues and organs, and all forms of 
preventive immunizations. This is the part of health care for 
which state public health will assume responsibility, providing 
it to the part of the population that is still unemployed and to 
budget-supported organizations. 
[Ambartsumyan]Everyone is troubled by the main 
issue--treatment of the sick. On what principle will it be 
provided under insured medicine? 
[Kulzhanov]Therapeutic assistance that will be 
rendered under the conditions of mandatory health insurance is 
now acquiring the form of a commodity. It is with regard for 
this that medical economic standards, which include mutual 
settlements between insurance companies and medical 
institutions, have been developed. The cost of treating the most 
widespread diseases, the average duration of health care, 
possible predictable complications, the results of treatment and 
continuity of its stages are all written into these standards. 
The medical economic standards are of the necessary volume 
guaranteeing the quality of treatment. This program is planned 
for 3 years, during which time we will be able to break the 
system in and introduce the appropriate adjustments that will 
certainly be needed. 
[Ambartsumyan]Maksut Karimovich, the editor's office 
is receiving anxious letters in which people, its seems, are not 
very trusting of this innovation, and ask again and again for 
information on the system of mandatory health insurance. 
[Kulzhanov]Any form of insurance, be it voluntary or 
mandatory, requires a controlling and distributing body which 
could coordinate and manage the enormous amount of financial 
activity at the basis of insurance relations. 
  Thus if we take an oblast as an example, we propose 
establishing a trusteeship council within its administration, to 
be headed by the administration deputy chief for social 
problems. The representatives of this council include the chiefs 
of the public health administrations, of the oblast financial 
administration and of the tax inspection office, trade union 
workers, and the chief executives of major enterprises. Were we 
to represent our insurance system in the form of a diagram, the 
third link would be a health insurance fund receiving money 
transferred from the state budget and from enterprises. However, 
the rather complex problem of receiving money into the fund's 
clearing account arises in this stage. I don't think that there 
will be any difficulties with appropriations form the state 
budget--they'll come in properly. But how are we to organize 
transfer of funds from the enterprises and the various 
organizations, especially considering that there are hundreds of 
them in the capital, not counting the small enterprises and 
joint ventures? Many of them will deliberately avoid payment, 
and drag their heels in carrying out this procedure, so 
unpleasant to them, citing unprofitability and other factors. 
  I feel that the tax inspection office should become a 
powerful influence in relation to mandatory payments. It is 
interested in proper transfer of financial deductions, and the 
wages of workers of the inspection office will depend directly 
on the amount transferred to this fund. 
[Ambartsumyan]As with anything new, insured medicine 
harbors unforeseen complications; to what extent are you 
prepared for them? 
[Kulzhanov]They may arise chiefly between the patient 
and doctor. Expert groups consisting of the main unaffiliated 
specialists will be established under the health departments for 
this purpose. It is they who will be able to resolve conflicts 
with the greatest objectivity, performing the role of arbiters 
between therapeutic and preventive institutions, patients and 
the insurance companies. This form of their activity will be 
paid for by the guilty party. 
  An accrediting and licensing bureau is, I believe, of no 
lesser significance. It will perform an important role in 
registering small enterprises, and small and midsized medical 
institutions occupying premises satisfying the necessary 
requirements of epidemiological oversight. It would also make 
sure that the personnel working in them are highly qualified, 
because there already have been many attempts to register 
``therapeutic institutions'' having not a single physician, or 
even a nurse. Also, persons having nothing to do with medicine 
but possessing dubious credentials, such as extrasensory 
practitioners, bioenergetic surgeons and so on, have tried to 
``take over'' therapeutic activity. 
[Ambartsumyan]In what practical ways will relations 
between insurance companies and medical institutions be 
maintained? 
[Kulzhanov]In each case the cost of the course of 
treatment for a patient is to be determined by the medical 
institution. After that, if the insurance company feels it to be 
excessive, it will have the right to appeal to an expert group. 
  Thus the new economic relations are creating conditions in 
which the rights and interests of the patients are protected 
foremost. And as for the insurance companies themselves, it 
would be to their advantage to have well-equipped medical 
institutions with the corresponding top-class team of 
specialists, and to materially support this necessary balance. 
[Ambartsumyan]We haven't yet broached the question of 
rural public health in our interview: The opinion exists that it 
must remain under the support of the budget, because in view of 
their small amount, insurance premiums will simply be unable to 
provide for the level of health care that existed before. 
[Kulzhanov]Naturally in these days when agriculture 
is basically an unprofitable sector, the system of 
budget-supported insured health care foresees pooling of 
resources received from insurance premiums as a supplement to 
basic budget financing of rural public health. Monetary 
resources will be redistributed from the stronger regions to the 
weaker ones. And then we can talk about stabler provision of

  [Text] Health insurance is presently evoking not only 
elevated interest but also serious debate among health care 
workers, separating them into distinct ``pro'' and ``con'' 
camps. To some executives of the public health system, it is 
first of all a source of additional financial resources needed 
to improve health protection and to raise the effectiveness of 
health care provided to the population. Others feel it to be the 
logical culmination of the sector's transition to the new 
economic mechanism. As I see it, both points of view have a 
right to life. 
  Analysis of the numerous opinions, sometimes diametrically 
opposed, shows that it would not be acceptable to duplicate 
foreign health insurance experience in our republic. 
  According to WHO data, different insured health care schemes 
are found in almost 30 countries, covering a total of over 800 
million persons. In this case insured health care is not 
developing in any one of them as an antipode to national public 
health systems. 
  Our public health system, which evolved over the course of 
many decades, doubtlessly has its positive sides. But at the 
same time it is obvious not only that the firmly established 
principle of residual financing, the extremely conservative 
economic relations and the obsolete administrative structure are 
totally inconsistent with the new laws of the marketplace, but 
also that these factors are an obstacle to implementing the new 
legislative acts adopted by the parliament. 
  The law ``On Protection of the Health of the People of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan'' includes for the first time a section 
presenting the fundamental principles of forming and developing 
health insurance. However, the law ``On Health Insurance'' 
currently being examined at a session of the republic's Supreme 
Soviet requires serious reform of the entire system of social 
insurance, radical change of tax policy, and abandonment of the 
practice of financing public health on the basis of the residual 
principle; if these things are not done, it would be impossible 
to make it effective. 
  Public health developed for a long time out of touch with 
economic realities. As a consequence it lost all understanding 
of the expense mechanism of its activity, of contemporary 
quality standards, and of the real demand for resources. 
  The draft health insurance law foresees financing public 
health through a balanced combination of budget and nonbudget 
financing sources. 
  The very idea of attracting the resources of enterprises, 
institutions and organizations, including to create insurance 
funds, is not new. However, its implementation is encountering 
certain difficulties today: There's the transition to market 
relations, the need for added investments into production, and 
the tendency for wages to rise. 
  Mandatory contributions by enterprises, institutions and 
organizations to territorial health insurance funds will become 
a nonbudget source of public health financing. The new tax is to 
be computed as a percentage of the wage fund, which will 
naturally have the effect of raising product cost. The magnitude 
of this percentage that would satisfy all sides is a matter of 
heated debate today. I propose a simple formula for determining 
the mandatory insurance premium: 
  P = SR(100+n)/F, 
  where: P--the amount of the mandatory insurance premium (a 
percentage of the wage fund); 
  S--mean annual cost of an optimum volume of health care 
services rendered to one employee; 
  R--mean annual number of employees; 
  n--percent of overhead that would ensure profitable 
operation 
of the health insurance system; 
  F--annual wage fund. 
  In this case the mean cost of the optimum volume of health 
care services rendered to a single employee over the course of a 
year may be differentiated depending on presence of occupational 
hazards and on the nature of the working conditions. 
  The proposed method makes it possible to carry out the 
necessary computations both at the regional level and in 
application to individual enterprises, institutions and 
organizations, regardless of forms of ownership. Given 
legislative establishment of a fixed percent of contributions to 
the health insurance fund, the business entity could use the 
procedure I propose to determine the adequacy of the means at 
its disposal and the magnitude of the percent contributions to 
the indicated fund. 
  Transition to a market economy and the accompanying 
inflationary processes prevent any discussion of the specific 
amounts that have to be appropriated today for the development 
insurance programs. According to my calculations the amount of 
the insurance premium for mandatory health insurance in South 
Kazakhstan Oblast would have to be 14 percent. 
  Obviously when we implement the concepts of health insurance 
we will have to determine the amounts of the insurance premiums 
concretely on the basis of local conditions, and the 
mathematical model I propose here will be an aid in doing so.

<F P=106> [Article by T. I. Sukashev, L. U. Gapuova, A. Zh. Nauanova, </F>
M. S. Rozenberg and B. K. Yelamanov, Aktyubinsk Oblast Public 
Health and Epidemiological Station; UDC 614:621.31] 
  [Text]Abstract: A department of informatics and ASU 
was established at the Aktyubinsk Oblast Public Health and 
Epidemiological Station, while automated control system (ASU) 
groups were formed at the rayon level. Information was 
transmitted from the rayons to the oblast ASU, where the data 
were fed into a computer. This freed specialists of the oblast 
public health and epidemiological station from having to fill 
out report forms and other documents. The experience of working 
with computers showed that epidemic control measures are now 
being implemented more efficiently and promptly in the public 
health system. 
  Key Words: public health and epidemiological station, 
computer, automated control system, preventive work. 
  Computerization of public health and epidemiological 
institutions, which is gaining momentum, should culminate in 
creation of a sector-wide automated system for managing the 
public health and epidemiological service of the Kazakh 
Republic. The Sanepid OASU [Sector Automated Control System of 
the Kazakh Republic Public Health and Epidemiological Service] 
is a man-machine information and advisory system in which man 
functions as the controlling and decision-making unit, and which 
is intended for dynamic observation, evaluation and prediction 
of correlations in a complex social triad: 
production--environment--public health. The goal of the ASU is 
prompt and high quality accounting, analysis, evaluation and 
prediction of the health of the population and of the state of 
the environment, and their interaction. 
  Under the OASU presently in operation, activities of 
administrative bodies such as collecting, monitoring and storing 
data, analyzing them from numerous aspects, subjecting results 
to expert examination and issuing hygienic conclusions are 
automated. These bodies also retain the functions of evaluating 
the presented results and making administrative decisions. All 
of this requires the strictest possible fulfillment of certain 
requirements. First of all the same package of programs must be 
used throughout, so that the information could be processes 
throughout the republic as a whole, and feedback could be 
provided. 
  A department of informatics and ASU was established under 
the 
oblast public health and epidemiological station in early 1992 
and ASU groups, each consisting of three persons and supported 
by public funding, were formed at the city and rayon levels in 
order to service the computers and process the data. The data 
transmission procedure was simplified: Data are now transmitted 
by telephone from local public health and epidemiological 
stations and then fed into the computer. This frees specialists 
of the oblast public health and epidemiological station from 
having to fill out report forms, and the information is 
transmitted to the Ministry of Health by modem. In the past it 
was sent by mail or by courier. 
  Use of 12 computer programs makes it possible to efficiently 
control the public health and epidemiological situation in the 
oblast. Thus, after the data are processed, a specialist may 
request, at any time and in the necessary quantity, outputted 
documents representing report form No. 1 (infectious morbidity) 
taking the form of 24 statistical tables, and form No. 5 
(preventive immunizations) with 12 statistical tables. 
Analytical tables on individual infectious diseases in the 
reporting period of the current year (in absolute numbers and as 
indicators per 100,000 population) are furnished to specialists 
on demand. The growth or decline of morbidity on a cross section 
of the oblast's administrative territories is calculated in 
these tables. The user sets a fixed data monitoring period--a 
week, a month, a quarter or a year. At the sector level we 
selected a week. 
  The processed information consists of values of monitored 
indicators referenced to particular objects of analysis (water, 
food products, air, the population etc.) and objects of 
inspection (monitored institutions and territorial facilities) 
at which the corresponding bacteriological, public health and 
chemical analyses were made. 
  The monitored indicators include unsatisfactory results of 
bacteriological analyses (for example, isolation of pathogenic 
and conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, detection of 
various sorts of deviations of the overall content of 
microorganisms from the standards, and so on), as well as 
so-called ``risk factors'' (information on physicochemical 
pollution, violations of production conditions, accidents etc.). 
  The ``Public Health and Epidemiological Evaluation of 
Industrial and Drinking Water Supply'' program provides an 
objective evaluation of the potential epidemiological danger 
presented by water pipelines on a regular basis (once a month), 
while the ``Public Health and Epidemiological Evaluation of 
Oblast Dairies'' program gives evidence of the probability of 
production of infected products. 
  Creation of a single set of software for the republic's 
entire public health and epidemiological service creates the 
possibility, depending on the way in which this software is 
used, to make the necessary changes and additions in the course 
of operation, with regard for, as an example, the specific needs 
of the user, the particular statistical report forms, and so on. 
  The issue of computerizing the republic's public health and 
epidemiological service at the oblast level has now been 
resolved, which has resulted in the creation of a unified 
network and a sector-wide data bank. In our oblast, besides the 
oblast computers there are also computers in the city and the 
Martukskiy public health and epidemiological stations. In the 
future, as funds are appropriated, we intend to furnish each 
rayon public health and epidemiological station with a minimum 
of one IBM PC/AT personal computer, which will make it possible 
to fundamentally change the system for collecting, transmitting 
and analyzing information, and to upgrade the quality and 
efficiency of its processing. 
  Efforts to organize and operate data bases and software in 
the first generation of the Sanepid OASU have now entered their 
final stage in the oblast. We have created a data base 
supporting background public health indicators, infectious 
morbidity indicators, the accounting and use of bacterial 
preparations, and other programs at the rayon level. This is 
making it possible to manage the public health and 
epidemiological situation better, and to develop packages of 
public health and epidemic control measures with adequate lead 
time.
