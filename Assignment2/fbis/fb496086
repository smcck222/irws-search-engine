  [Text] A conclusion can be reached regarding Kazakhstan's 
industrial potential from the fact that it produces 90 percent 
of the titanium, magnesium, yellow phosphorus and chromium, 70 
percent of the zinc, over 60 percent of the lead and more than 
half of the silver mined in CIS states. Rich deposits of ore 
(Kustanay Oblast), nonferrous metals (East Kazakhstan, 
Zhezkazgan), coal (Karaganda, Pavlodar), phosphorus (South 
Kazakhstan, Dzhambul) and oil (Atyrau, Mangistau) are being 
developed in the republic. 
  Oversaturation of mining and processing industry and 
outdated 
production procedures resulted in dramatic worsening of the 
environment and the people's health, and in a number of cases, 
in global ecological changes and formation of biogeochemical 
provinces. Thus, the East Kazakhstan industrial complex contains 
enterprises of nonferrous metallurgy and mining industry. The 
Ust-Kamenogorsk lead and zinc works are located practically at 
the city center, and large polymetallic works are located in 
Leninogorsk in poor ventilation conditions. Pollution of 
environmental objects by heavy metals in this region has 
attained levels dangerous to the people's health. This is 
chiefly true of lead, zinc and cadmium, which accumulate in the 
human body in higher quantities. 
  A complex situation is also evolving in South Kazakhstan. 
The 
environment of Shimkent is being polluted by releases from lead 
and phosphorus plants, while that of Dzhambul is being polluted 
by releases from phosphorus and superphosphate plants, which 
contain fluorine and phosphorus compounds that settle on the 
soil far away from the pollution sources. It is no accident that 
cases of fluorosis have been noted here among farm animals. 
  In Aktyubinsk, the ferroalloy and chromium compound plants 
and the heat and electric power station release a large quantity 
of chromium and boron impurities, while plants in Alga release 
hydrogen fluoride. Development of the Chilisayskiy phosphorite 
deposit is creating additional ecological difficulties in this 
region. 
  In addition to ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, mercury 
pollution of the air of Temirtau, the water and bottom deposits 
of the River Nura, and of farming and livestock products in its 
basin is the most urgent problem in Central Kazakhstan. Use of 
metallic mercury in the production process was the cause of this. 
  The public of Kazakhstan continues to be troubled by the 
ecological situation around the Semipalatinsk nuclear test 
range. And although according to official data the radiation 
situation there no longer raises any apprehensions, there are no 
grounds for reassurance. 
  Swift development of coal industry and power engineering in 
the Pavlodar-Ekibastuz fuel and energy complex, which burns 
brown coal with an ash content of up to 45 percent, has 
seriously aggravated the ecological situation there. 
  Oil and gas extraction industry developed intensively in a 
number of regions of the republic in the last 5-7 years, 
worsening the ecological situation there. Thus, the air is being 
polluted by releases of gas, especially during its combustion, 
at concentrations dangerous to human life. The water of 
subterranean and surface sources is highly mineralized, and it 
is being polluted additionally by petroleum products. Elevated 
concentrations of chemicals--vanadium, barium and others--are 
being detected in soil and in farming products. Anthropogenic 
biogeochemical provinces with a radius of up to 20 km have begun 
forming in these places. 
  Many of Kazakhstan's cities have found themselves hostage to 
the deleterious influence of not only large industrial complexes 
but also motor transportation. 
  Besides the substances named above, the air of population 
centers is being polluted by the combustion products of coal, 
fuel oil, and sometimes crude oil. In this case toxic metals 
such as strontium, barium, lead, arsenic, vanadium, cobalt and 
beryllium are released into the environment, while vanadium is 
released by the burning of fuel oil and oil. During combustion 
of fossil fuel, carbon monoxide, nitric oxides and sulfur 
dioxide also enter the air. 
  The complex ecological situation that has established itself 
in the republic is noticeably reflecting upon the health of the 
population, including on demographic processes. Thus, high 
population mortality is observed in the most unfavorable 
regions. These are East Kazakhstan (9.9 cases per 1,000 
population), North Kazakhstan (9.5) and West Kazakhstan (8.6) 
oblasts and Almaty (8.8), as compared to an average republican 
indicator of 8.0. The highest level of infant mortality is in 
Kzyl-Orda (33.8 cases per 1,000 births), Mangistau (33.4), 
Atyrau (33.4), Turgay (33.2) and South Kazakhstan (30.8) 
oblasts, as compared to an average republican indicator of 27.4. 
Thus a low birth rate and a high death rate are the main causes 
of the low natural population increase that has evolved in East 
Kazakhstan (6.1 per 1,000 population), Karaganda (6.9), North 
Kazakhstan (7.8) and Akmola (10.1) oblasts, as compared to the 
republican average (13.0). 
  In addition to this, a high level of population morbidity is 
also typical of the republic's ecologically unfavorable regions. 
Thus in the most highly polluted cities (Shimkent, Dzhambul) it 
is 2-2.5 times higher than in relatively clean ones 
(Tselinograd). Nonetheless, respiratory diseases occupy the 
leading place in the morbidity structure of all cities, diseases 
of digestive organs and the circulatory system dominate in the 
dirtiest ones, while diseases of the nervous system and sensory 
organs, the skeletomuscular system and connective tissue 
dominate in relatively clean ones. 
  As far as concerns information on the ecological situation 
in 
the Aral region, it is simply astounding. People living in 
Kazakhstan, and in all contiguous states as well, are alarmed by 
the state of affairs in the zone of the Aral Sea, where the fate 
of the peoples of Central Asia and of a vast part of Kazakhstan, 
and the fate of civilization in this region of ancient cultures, 
hangs in the balance. In this connection the Kazakh Republic 
Supreme Soviet adopted the law`` On Social Protection of 
Citizens Who Suffered From the Ecological Disaster in the Aral 
Region.'' In compliance with the law, the Cabinet of Ministers 
decree ``On Immediate Measures to Fundamentally Change the 
Living Conditions of the Population of the Aral Region'' 
proclaimed the Kazakh part of this region to be a zone of 
ecological catastrophe. All of the territory of the Aral region 
has been divided into three zones with regard for the gravity of 
the ecological situation and the influence of desertification 
and the environment's pollution upon human health--the zone of 
ecological disaster, the zone of ecological crisis and the zone 
of an ecologically precritical state. 
  The ecological catastrophe occurring in the region is having 
a negative influence upon different sectors of the republic's 
national economy. The situation is aggravated not only by 
dramatic shallowing of this large water basin, but also by 
worsening of the quality of the water--high mineralization and 
pollution by pesticides and agents of intestinal infections. The 
sea level has dropped 14 m, the shoreline in the Kazakh part of 
the sea has receded 60-80 km, and by over 100 km in some places, 
water salinity has climbed to 28-30 gm/liter, and the sea has 
transformed into a lifeless body of saline water. 
  Together with unfavorable socioeconomic factors, degradation 
of the ecosystem in the Aral region significantly worsened the 
human habitat and is negatively influencing the health of the 
population. In almost all zones of the ecological catastrophe 
the birth rate is decreasing and population 
mortality--especially infant mortality--is high, primarily 
because of the weaker condition of women (in connection with 
dramatic worsening of their health in view of the habitat's 
degradation) and bronchopulmonary, infectious and parasitic 
diseases. 
  Mortality of children in their first year of life due to 
congenital developmental abnormalities is growing. The number of 
children with congenital defects in this region is 10 percent 
above the republican average. 
  While in the late 1970s the Aral region was typified by high 
incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases, tuberculosis and 
oncological diseases, in recent years the number of mental 
disorders, suicides and other abnormalities is growing in 
addition. Today the structure of pathology in the population of 
the Aral region is dominated by infectious and parasitic 
diseases, by diseases of digestive organs, blood, hemopoietic 
organs and the circulatory system, and by mental disorders. 
Moreover these groups of diseases are exhibiting a persistent 
rising trend in all zones of ecological catastrophe. Of interest 
is the fact that in the Aral region, where the population is 
ethnically homogeneous (Kazakhs) and has developed a negative 
attitude toward interruption of pregnancy through centuries of 
tradition, the number of abortions has recently increased, over 
half of pregnant women suffer extragenital diseases, and 
maternal mortality is high. 
  The level of sanitation in the region's population centers 
is 
extremely low, the availability of housing per inhabitant is the 
lowest in the republic, and the quality of drinking water is 
poor. Owing to this, the incidence of typhoid fever, 
paratyphoid, salmonellosis and other acute intestinal 
infections, as well as of viral hepatitis, is growing from one 
year to the next, significantly surpassing the average 
indicators for the republic. 
  The highest indicators of primary disability were noted in 
the Aral region's ecological catastrophe zone, with the main 
causes being tuberculosis, malignant tumors and circulatory 
diseases. 
  And finally, all of this lies heavy on the hearts of all who 
have a part in protecting the health of the inhabitants of the 
Aral region. This is why the republic's medical community and 
population have voiced their approval of documents drawn up by 
medical scientists--the ``Interim Statute on Changing the Status 
of Citizens Who Suffered From the Ecological Disaster, and on 
the Procedure for Establishing (Terminating) Compensatory 
Payments and Granting Benefits to the Population for Damage to 
its Health'' and the ``Interim Criteria for Evaluating the 
Health of People Residing in the Aral Region.'' These documents 
have made it possible to somewhat improve social protection to 
citizens who suffered from the ecological catastrophe. 
  In order to improve the ecological situation and the health 
of the population both in the Aral region and in the republic, 
we need to develop short, medium and long term improvement 
measures. There is a lot of hard work ahead, and it should 
produce positive results.

  [Text] Abstract: A study was conducted of the 
frequency of congenital developmental defects and monogenic 
genetic diseases in children residing in Beskaragayskiy, 
Zhanasemeyskiy and Abayskiy rayons, Semipalatinsk Oblast 
adjacent to the nuclear test range. It was established that the 
frequency of occurrence of congenital developmental defects in 
children was elevated in these regions. 
  Four bibliographic reference, two tables. 
  Key Words: congenital developmental defects, chromosome 
aberration, nuclear radiation. 
  The mutagenic effects of ionizing radiation have been 
illuminated rather extensively in the literature [2,4,6,8]. 
Their registration is one of the approaches to biological 
dosimetry [3,5,9,10]. At the same time the structure and 
occurrence of genetic pathology in the population of a region 
within which nuclear explosions were actually carried out over 
the course of four decades have not been addressed by 
researchers. Nor has there been any research on the frequency of 
detection of different types of chromosome aberrations in 
lymphocytes of the blood of persons living in direct proximity 
to a test range. The purpose of this paper is to fill in this 
blank. The need for it was brought about by the absence of 
dependable information on the dose loads experienced by people 
who suffered from nuclear weapon tests. These dose loads may be 
estimated indirectly using the results of research on the 
frequency of detection of chromosome aberrations in different 
age groups. 
<H5>  Materials and Methods </H5>
  We analyzed statistical reporting materials of public health 
agencies, the birth and developmental histories of newborn 
infants, and records of autopsies of children who died at an age 
of up to 1 year in Semipalatinsk. We took account of cases of 
congenital developmental defects and diagnosis of hereditary 
diseases. We studied the frequency of detection of congenital 
developmental defects and monogenic genetically caused diseases 
in Beskaragayskiy, Zhanasemeyskiy and Abayskiy rayons, which 
suffered the most from the effects of ionizing radiation, and 
Kokpektinskiy Rayon as a control. Cytogenetic research was 
conducted on material from 31 clinically healthy students of the 
Semipalatinsk Medical Institute, 11 of whom (21.4 years old on 
the average) lived outside the northeastern region of Kazakhstan 
prior to entering the VUZ and who had resided for not more than 
2 years in Semipalatinsk before the time of their examination. 
They made up the first group of subjects. The second included 11 
students (20.8 years old on the average) who were indigenous 
inhabitants of Semipalatinsk. A third group was made up of nine 
students in their first and second years, who lived in Mayskiy 
Rayon, Pavlodar Oblast, which is directly adjacent to the test 
area, prior to entering the institute. 
  The frequency of chromosome aberrations was determined by 
cytological analysis of preparations of metaphasic chromosomes 
obtained by culturing lymphocytes from peripheral blood by the 
micromethod [7]. One hundred metaphase plates, selected 
according to criteria recommended in [1], were analyzed for each 
individual. A total of 3,100 metaphase plates were studied. 
<H5>  Research Results and Discussion </H5>
  Data on the occurrence and structure of genetic pathology in 
the child population of different rayons adjacent to the test 
range are presented in Table 1.

  As we can see, the frequency of detection of congenital 
developmental defects was highest in Beskaragayskiy Rayon--1.5 
+/-0.004 percent--that is 10.47 per 1,000 population. This 
indicator was 3.3 times higher than that for children residing 
in Kokpektinskiy Rayon (control), it was 1.6 times higher than 
that found in Zhanasemeyskiy, and 2.6 times higher than the 
indicator in Abayskiy Rayon. These differences were 
statistically highly significant (P[.sub]1[/]&lt;0.001, 
P[.sub]2[/]&lt;0.001, P[.sub]3[/]&lt;0.001). 
  One of the most important causes of the appearance of 
congenital developmental defects in children is chromosome 
abnormalities, the frequency of which typically rises in 
response to ionizing radiation [4,5,6]. The results of research 
on the frequency of different types of aberrations in 
chromosomes in the lymphocytes of the blood of persons residing 
in the region adjacent to the test range are shown in Table 2.

  As we can see, the frequency of detection of aberrant cells 
was 1.9 +/- 0.3 percent for students from outside the city prior 
to entering the medical institute (first group), it was 3.2 +/- 
1.2 percent for students who were indigenous inhabitants of 
Semipalatinsk (second group), which was 1.5 times higher than 
for the first group, although this difference was not 
statistically significant (P&gt; 0.1). This indicator was 3.7 +/- 
0.3 percent for students who had resided in Mayskiy Rayon, 
Pavlodar Oblast prior to entering the VUZ (third group), which 
was 1.95 times higher than for subjects of the first group. This 
difference was statistically highly significant (P&lt;0.001). A 
tendency for the frequency of detection of aberrant cells in 
students of the third group to rise in comparison with the 
second was also detected, although this difference was not 
statistically significant (P&gt; 0.1). 
  The total number of chromosome aberrations in students of 
the 
first group was 2.0 +/- 0.24 per 100 cells--that is 1.6 times 
lower than in the second group (3.2 +/- 1.2 per 100 cells). This 
difference was not statistically significant (P&gt; 0.1). However, 
the number of chromosome aberrations in students of the second 
group was found to be 1.9 times higher than for students of the 
first, with the statistical significance of the indicated 
differences being high (P&lt;0.001). 
  When we studied the types of aberrations we found that the 
chromosome type was encountered significantly more often in 
persons of the third group than in persons of the first 
(P&lt;0.05). Chromatid aberrations were encountered significantly 
more often in persons of the third group than in the second 
(P&lt;0.5) and first (P&lt;0.05) groups. 
  We know that the frequency of spontaneous aberrations of 
chromosomes in lymphocytes in human peripheral blood, determined 
in special research using large samples, is sufficiently low, 
varying on the average from 1.0 to 1.2 percent [1]. In this case 
it does not depend on the sex of the subjects, but it increases 
with age, attaining 5-6 percent in persons over 60 years old. In 
this connection we selected groups that were homogeneous with 
respect to age for our research. 
  Thus our research established that the frequency of 
chromosome aberrations in students who were inhabitants of 
Mayskiy Rayon, which is directly adjacent to the Semipalatinsk 
nuclear test range, was the highest. Moreover we also discovered 
a tendency for the frequency of detection of chromosome 
aberrations in students who were indigenous inhabitants of 
Semipalatinsk to increase in comparison with students who lived 
outside the northeastern region of Kazakhstan prior to entering 
the medical institute. 
  It is evident from Table 1 that the frequency of detection 
of 
monogenic genetically caused diseases was highest in 
Beskaragayskiy Rayon (0.31 +/- 0.007 percent), while in 
Zhanasemeyskiy Rayon it was 3.5 times lower that the indicator 
for Kokpektinskiy Rayon, the population of which suffered to a 
relatively lesser degree from ionizing radiation as a result of 
the test range's operation. This can apparently be explained by 
the fact that point mutations play the dominant role in the 
advent of monogenic diseases, and according to some data [6,8] 
their frequency changes insignificantly in response to small 
doses of ionizing radiation. 
  Thus our research established a rise in frequency of 
occurrence of congenital developmental defects in the child 
population residing in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear 
test range. This pattern is explained by the higher frequency of 
chromosome aberrations detected in persons residing permanently 
in the region; a tendency for this frequency to rise with 
decreasing distance from the test range was also observed. The 
influence of its factors on the frequency of occurrence of 
monogenic genetically caused diseases could not be established 
dependably in this research; this question does need additional 
study.

  [Text] Previously, complete NMR [.sup]1[/]H, [.sup]13[/] 
C parameters were available only for trans-_a_- 
Lewisite [1] and partial parameters for [.sup]1[/]H, [.sup]13[/] 
C([.sup]1[/]H) trans-_a_-, _b_-, and _g_- 
Lewisites [2]. 
  We have obtained complete NMR parameters for all Lewisite 
components (Table 1) as synthesized by method [3]: 1 + 2, b.p. 
55ÎC (10 torr); 3, b.p. 90ÎC (10 torr); 4 + 5, b.p. 
130ÎC (10 torr). 
  A new isomer 5 was isolated from a mixture of 4 + 5 using 
chromatography on silica gel (cf. ref 4), eluent - 
C[.sub]6[/]H[.sub]6[/], b.p. 127 ÎC (10 torr) and the 
element analysis (C, H) characterized. The content of 5 in 
_g_-Lewisite was 15-18 percent.

([.sup]1[/]H 400.13 MHz, [.sup]13[/]C 100.62 MHz) in 
C[.sub]6[/]D[.sub]6[/] from TMS. Sample concentrations 0.1 
percent ([.sup]1[/]H) and 2 percent ([.sup]13[/]C).&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The configuration of compounds 1-5 was confirmed by values 
for internal KSSB [.sup]3[/]J[.sub]HH[/][.sup]trans[/] 
&gt;  [.sup]3[/]J[.sub]HH[/][.sup]cis[/] (see ref. 1, 2, 
5, and 6). In the spectrum for compound 5, the [.sup]1[/]H 
signal intensity ratio for trans/cis chlorovinyl groups was 
equal to 2. The [.sup]13[/]C signals are referenced on the 
basis of [.sup]1[/]J[.sub]CH[/] values, since for the 
number one carbon atom the chlorinated vinyl group is always [.sup]1[/] 

J[.sub]CH[/] Ú 195 Hz. Thus, the high pole [.sup]13[/] 
C signal corresponds to C(2), while the weak pole 
corresponds to C(1). This reference is similary confirmed by the 
presence of observed weak pole [.sup]13[/]C inter-chain 
signals, whose values are characteristic for R[.sub]3[/]As (R 
= Me (4.2 Hz), Et (3.0 Hz) (see ref. 7). Furthermore, two 
dimensional correlational spectrum of [.sup]1[/] 
H[.sup]13[/]C COSY demonstrated that the high 
pole [.sup]1[/]H signal corresponds to H(2), and the weak 
pole signal to H(1). 
  Based on the above data, it now becomes possible to 
unequavically determine the presence of compound 5 in 
_g_-Lewisite from published NMR spectra (see ref. 2). 
Therefore, 
technical grade Lewisite is not a four-component substance as 
previously presumed, but rather a five-component mixture of 
isomers having a general formula of 
(ClCH=CH)[.sub]m[/]AsCl[.sub]3-m[/]. We also determined 
that the KCCB of carbon in the CN-group to be [.sup]3[/] 
J[.sub]CAsCH[/] = 5.0 Hz for PhAs(CN)Me as 
synthesized by method (ref. 8). Thus, this KCCB may be utilized 
as a structural test in the chemistry of arsenic-organic 
compounds containing a contiguous carbon of sp-, 
sp[.sup]2[/]- , or sp[.sup]3[/]-hybridization.

  [Text] A large part of discussions on the problem of 
chemical weapons (CW) disposal is associated with safe 
completion of this process. Only a well thought out system for 
CW disposal (CWD) safety assurance can serve as a real guarantee 
of achieving the required safety. The creation of such a system 
should have precedence in the set of scientific-technical and 
organizational-practical measures, which, as available foreign 
and domestic experience has shown, are effectively represented 
in the form of a corresponding scientific-technical program 
(STP). 
  The urgency of this type of STP in modern conditions is 
extremely high. It is known that total expenditures on safety 
assurance programs today reach 20% of the total amounts 
allocated to scientific objectives. In the last two decades, 
expenditures on STPs associated with protecting the environment 
from contamination by harmful emissions and waste from the 
chemical industry have noticeably increased. Already at the end 
of the 1970's, the share of expenditures on these objectives at 
15 large companies in the USA was an average 14% of total 
expenditures on scientific work.[1] 
  Therefore, the significant stocks of CW, their extreme 
potential danger to man and the environment, along with the 
current social tension, predetermine the need to create the STP 
``Safety of Facilities, Population, and the Environment During 
Chemical Weapon Disposal.'' The goal of the program is to 
develop scientific methodological principles, continuous 
apparatus, a set of standardizing legal documents, and a system 
of technical means to assure safety in the arrangement, 
construction, and operation of technological systems and 
facilities associated with CW disposal. 
Basis of the STP Content and Structure 
  In creating the STP, it is important to consider features of 
its future implementation. Among these, the following are 
primary: 
  1. Achievement of extremely high indicators of effectiveness 
in the safety assurance of CWD processes with regard to the 
extreme danger of disposal facilities. 
  2. Careful coordination of the STP with founding laws and 
scientific-technical documents in specific and related fields. 
  3. Intent public attention to the problem of disposal and a 
high probability that the public will influence the course of 
implementing specific organizational and scientific-technical 
decisions in a significant way. 
  4. A requirement for achieving close international 
cooperation in solving many CWD problems in view of the global 
nature of the central problem. 
  Analysis of the enumerated principles of CWD processes, as 
well as accumulated experience, allows one to identify a number 
of methodological principles whose subsequent observance serves 
as a definite guarantee against mistakes in developing 
scientific-technical politics in the field of safety assurance 
in CWD processes. Principles of systematization, unity, 
necessary and sufficient fulfillment of safety requirements, the 
concentration of efforts in main directions, the ability to 
implement, and adaptability are primary among these. 
  The indicated principles impose specific requirements on the 
formed STP: 

  -  the systematization principle requires one to consider the 
program as a system of measures closely associated with State 
documents and programs and, primarily, the project ``State 
Program for Chemical Weapon Disposal,'' the State STP ``Safety 
of the Population and National Economic Facilities, Based on the 
Risk of Occurrence of Natural or Industrial Disasters,'' 
approved in December 1990, the sector program for chemical 
industry safety, and other departmental and regional programs in 
which problems of industrial and ecological safety are resolved; 
  -  the unity principle indicates that the STP should be 
indivisible (or undergo minor changes) for various scenarios of 
the development of a situation with CW disposal; 
  -  the principle of necessary and sufficient fulfillment of 
safety 
assurance requirements requires that individual efforts and 
resources correspond to the character and complexity of arising 
scientific-technical problems; subsequent implementation of this 
principle allows one to eliminate conflict between individual 
problems of safety assurance and means for solving them; 
  -  the principle of concentrating efforts in main directions is 
associated with searching the aggregate of problems, which are 
varied in character and nonhomogeneous in significance, for 
those whose solution will allow one to emerge on an acceptable 
level of CWD safety in given time frames and with apportioned 
allocations; 
  -  the principle of the ability to implement indicates the 
feasibility of creating the necessary CWD safety assurance 
methods, based on existing industrial and information 
technologies; 
  -  the adaptability principle proposes that the STP structure 
and 
content should allow one to conduct scientific 
research-experimental design work (NIOKR) on individual problems 
within sufficiently wide ranges of change in the content of CWD 
facilities and technologies, climatic and meteorological 
conditions for facility operation, and requirements of State, 
regional, and departmental standarizing legal documents. 

    The observance of these principles for forming an STP in and 
of itself is not a guarantee that they will be successfully 
fulfilled. Here, a well thought out strategy for implementing 
the program is also important. In connection with this, its form 
should take into account the sequence for solving problems 
within the framework of major scientific directions and be 
specified by direction, including a list of NIOKR, time frames 
for conducting it, and primary organization-implementers. 
  In order to understand how the principles incorporated into 
the STP can be realized, it is advisable to begin with examining 
the CWD process itself, a typical simplified diagram of which is 
shown in the figure. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-03A>      Sequence for implementing primary levels of the CWD process. </FIG>


  In the general case, the CWD process goes through sequential 
stages of storage, preparation for transport, transport to the 
disposal facility, and immediate disposal. Analysis of the 
listed stages indicates that in each of them, three primary 
groups of facilities emerge that are subject to mandatory 
inspection within the framework of safety assurance problems and 
problems associated with general scientific approaches: 

  -  the set of technical methods and systems that allow one to 
assure practical realization of all components of the CWD 
process; 
  -  attendants of the CWD system facilities as well as the 
population living in facility site regions; 
  -  environmental facilities. 

    The accepted concept of safety assurance for all listed 
groups of facilities [2] is based on the close interaction of 
systems for predicting danger, assuring technical safety, 
monitoring the environment, and responding immediately to 
possible emergency situations. In such a manner, the basic 
content of the STP, as well as its form and course of 
implementation should correlate with the real CWD mechanism and 
safety concepts for a given process. 
  In order to provide a basis for an efficient STP structure, 
it is expedient to examine it as a system of preliminarily 
applied solutions in the field of safety. In this case, each 
scientific-technical problem must be expressed in the form of a 
set of partial problems and tasks that are connected to one 
another by determined relationships. The overall goal of the 
program is achieved by realizing the partial goals and solving 
the partial tasks. 
  It is clear that the STP structure, as with any other 
hierarchical system, can be given by indicating structural 
elements of the program and the connections between them. 
Therefore, it is desirable to use jointly applied procedures for 
breakdown and synthesis, particularly the ``goal tree'' method, 
whose basis consists of an heuristic procedure for breaking down 
general goals into individual components and giving the results 
in graph form.[3] 
  In order to fit the studied facility, it is advisable to use 
several criteria to perform the breakdown. Thus, the principle 
for dividing the CWD system into the previously indicated 
facility groups may be selected as the starting point for the 
first step of the breakdown: technical methods and systems, 
population, and the environment. In the second step of the 
breakdown, it is better to perform it by key elements of the 
safety assurance system--subsystems of risk analysis, technical 
safety assurance, monitoring, and emergency response.[2] 
  Finally, the third step of the breakdown is conducted by 
means and methods of solving arising scientific-technical 
problems, taking into account the aspects of CWD safety 
assurance selected in [4]. In this case, the extent of the 
breakdown is set effectively in compliance with conditions where 
the goal tree's lower apexes are connected to specializations of 
scientific collectives that are capable of independently solving 
individually costed scientific-technical tasks. 
  The construction of this type of graph is in the interests 
of 
the developing STP because it allows one not only to guarantee 
correlation and coordination of goals with respect to quality, 
but also to conduct a limited evaluation of their relative 
importance later, which is completely essential in determining 
time frames for solving specific problems with limited total 
resources and the impossibility of simultaneously realizing all 
directions of the STP. 
  Directions for STP development have been determined on the 
basis of analyzing requirements for the elemental content of a 
CWD safety assurance system (table 1).

  From table 2, it follows that as a result of implementing 
the 
proposed STP, the following will be developed: 

  -  safety standards in the form of requirements for the 
design, construction, and operation of CWD facilities, 
organization of the day-to-day activity of facility attendants, 
life of the population, preservation of the ecological 
background, and the set of technical means for assuring adopted 
safety standards; 
  -  a set of required technical methods that will allow one to 
implement the CWD safety system; 
  -  proposals for improving the adopted CWD safety system. 

    The next steps in setting up the STP will be to detail 
designated projects, to back specific NIOKR and facilities with 
financing, to select primary implementers, and to determine time 
frames for completing the work. 
  After the program has been set up, it is proposed to convene 
a panel of experts from Russian State institutions and to obtain 
its approval. Implementation of program tasks is planned for the 
period 1993-2000 with subsequent development until 2010. 
  The program calls for combined financing from various 
sources, depending on decided tasks, and it will be carried out 
from the following: 

  -  allocations from the national budget, divided among the 
development of priority directions of science and technology, 
the organization of technical and ecological monitoring and the 
development of corresponding technical methods, and to guarantee 
control over the state of the environment in regions where CWD 
facilities will be located; 
  -  resources allocated by international organizations for the 
implementation of programs in the field of international 
cooperation within the framework of acting national and 
international programs and international treaties for 
social-economic and legal regulation of population safety 
problems in regions where CWD facilities will be located. 

    Proposed expenditures for implementing scientific-technical 
measures in the program ``Safety of Facilities, Population, and 
the Environment During Chemical Weapon Disposal'' may comprise 
40-50 million rubles (in 1991 costs) or 8-10 million dollars. 
  The mechanism for imlementing the STP envisions the 
following: 

  -  utilization of obtained results as the basis 
for designing, constructing, and operating CWD facilities; 
  -  development of standardizing technical documentation that 
governs requirements for designing, constructing, operating, and 
dismantling CWD facilities, reducing their accident danger, 
protecting the environment, and protecting personnel and the 
population from the harmful effects of industrial disasters; 
  -  creation of scientific bases and develoment of safe 
technologies, technical systems, and equipment; 
  -  development of systems for monitoring the environment and for 
emergency response; 
  -  development of bases for legal, social, medical, and economic 
regulation of safety; 
  -  creation of bases for organizing international cooperation in 
the field of safety of technical systems, personnel, population, 
and the environment during CWD. 

    It should be noted that specific NIOKR within the framework 
of the proposed program already began in 1991. Toward this goal, 
basic research associated with developing proposals on 
organizing technical monitoring of mustard gas and lewisite 
storage facilities and on designing terminals for their removal 
from stationary tanks has begun at a number of STP divisions. 
Methods are being developed to evaluate the danger of accidents 
at CWD facilities, and preliminary data are being processed to 
evaluate the risk of poison gas (PG) storage facilities. Work is 
being conducted to evaluate the state of the environment in 
regions where PG storage facilities are located and the validity 
of ecological forecasting methods. Moreover, research on 
evaluating the health status of the population living near 
regions where PG is stored and the validity of medical methods 
for monitoring personnel and the population has begun. Great 
attention has been focused on conducting scientific research 
toward creating an emergency response system (ERS) for CWD 
assurance. In order to complete this work, leading scientific 
organizations (GRNIIOKhT, TsNIImash [Central Scientific Research 
Institute for Machine Building], Giprosintez [State Institute 
for the Design and Planning of Chemical Synthesis], NIIGTP, 
Institute of Toxicology, VNIIPO, etc.) and educational 
institutions (MGU [Moscow State University], SGU [Saratov Order 
Of the Red Banner of Labor State University imeni N. G. 
Chernyshevskiy or Smolensk State University], UdmGU [Udmurtia 
State University], IAE [Institute of Atomic Energy imeni I. V. 
Kurchatov], MIFI [Moscow Order of the Red Banner of Labor 
Engineering Physics Institute], etc.) have joined forces. 
  Specialists involved in developing the CWD safety system 
participated in international scientific conferences organized 
by UNEP that were devoted to discussing ecological safety 
problems and creation of the ERS. It has been planned to have 
foreign specialists participate in conducting scientific and 
expert investigations of the CWD safety problem. 
  The effect of introducing STP developments will be 
determined 
by the extent to which accidents are prevented, the reduction in 
economic losses, and the decrease in social and medical 
consequences of their liquidation.

``At Board Meeting of Russian Federation Fuel and Energy 
Ministry''] 
  [Text] The results of the work of the sectors of the fuel 
and energy complex in the first half of this year and the tasks 
for the second half of the year were examined. It was noted that 
the situation in these sectors is critical and is continuing to 
get more acute. 
  The amounts of fuel and energy resources recovered and 
produced have been decreasing for a long time. According to the 
Russian State Committee on Statistics [Goskomstat], the total 
volume of industrial production at enterprises of the fuel and 
energy complex in the first half of the year has decreased (in 
prices comparable with the very same period last year) by 13.8 
percent. In 1992, the decrease amounted to 11.3 percent. The 
greatest decreases were in recovery of oil and gas condensate 
(13.9 percent), production of gasolines for motor vehicles (14.4 
percent), and production of diesel fuel (15.4 percent). 
  The operation of individual enterprises in the complex and 
in 
its sectors as a whole has been paralyzed by the acute financial 
crisis. Market offerings of fuel and energy resources often 
surpass the demand of customers capable of paying for them. As a 
result, oil refineries have become overstocked with petroleum 
products, especially mazut, and have stopped accepting oil for 
refining. This has forced a cutback in oil recovery and the 
shutdown of operational wells. The provision of petroleum 
products for harvest operations in a number of regions and the 
creation of winter fuel reserves and fuel shipments to rayons in 
the Far North are danger of being interrupted. 
  Because of big flaws in price and tax policy, the complex's 
enterprises cannot form their own financial sources to develop 
production under the conditions of a market economy. Clear-cut 
proposals regarding changing the ratio of prices for energy 
resources and processing sector's products, reducing the tax 
component in fuel and energy prices, and taking measures to 
provide tax incentives for priority directions of the activity 
of fuel and energy complex enterprises have yet to be formulated. 
  Industry's investment complex is under the threat of 
collapse. In January through June of this year, very important 
construction jobs were financed at only 12.5 percent of the 
approved annual limit of budgetary allocations. The anticipated 
start-up of production facilities and facilities in the social 
sphere has been estimated to be 10-30 percent below the last 
year's level and will not exceed 50 percent of their 1988 level. 
Because of their high interest rate, government-issued loans are 
unacceptable for financing new construction or reconstruction 
and modernization of very important facilities. 
  The board approved a plan of action that included a broad 
set 
of measures: development and consideration by the Russian 
Federation government of a draft decision regarding a mechanism 
for giving priority to development of the sectors of fuel and 
energy complex and its state support partly by budgetary 
financing, investments in very important construction projects, 
and retention of unappropriated regulation funds for 1994-1995 
(obtained by deductions from product production costs). 
  Also very important are steps such as developing the 
conceptual principles of a pricing policy for the fuel and 
energy complex's products and accelerating the Russian 
Government's consideration of the drafts of the laws 
``Concerning Oil and Gas,'' ``Concerning the Foundations of a 
Federal Energy Policy,'' and ``Concerning Energy Conservation'' 
and the special federal program Fuel and Energy. 
  According to the approved plan, special emphasis is to be 
placed on the need for quick consideration in the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers of proposals to reduce the tax 
rate on the sale of fuel and lubricant materials to 10 percent. 
  In accordance with the board's decision, a rush report 
regarding the critical financial situation of the complex's 
enterprises will be sent to V.S. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the 
Russian Council of Ministers. The report will include an urgent 
request for his personal intervention in speeding up resolution 
of the fundamental questions regarding stabilizing the situation 
in the complex's sector.

  [Text] Chemically active polymers, particularly 
chemo-sorption fibers, are promising as a basis for immobilizing 
ions of various metals. At the same time, vigorous development 
is also taking place in the chemistry of clusters, or 
ultra-finely dispersed particles (UDCh), which have an 
extraordinary combination of electrical, magnetic, and catalytic 
properties not associated with bulkier samples of the metals. 
One way to resolve the problem of protecting UDCh is by 
surrounding them with ligands such as polymers. 
  A complex of research has been conducted on the preparation 
of cluster-containing fibrous materials based on chemo-sorption 
fibers of various chemical nature and containing acid and base 
groups. One way proposed to prepare this type of fiber includes 
stages where the metal ions are adsorbed on chemo-sorbents as a 
result of ion exchange and (or) complex formation reactions and 
subsequent reduction in a reducing solution. 
  Research made it possible to reveal several consistencies 
peculiar to processes of chemical metalization of plastics and 
chemo-sorption fibers. Using compositions for chemical 
metalization of plastics does not permit preparation of fibers 
containing a reduced metal. Because of the fact that metal ions 
are pre-fixed in the fiber, and any subsequent activity from a 
reducing solution cannot take place, the nature of formation of 
metal-containing particles in the fiber is changed. During 
chemical reduction, a multi-act process takes place between 
discrete metal ions and a reducing agent resulting in the 
formation of nascent sized particles capable of agglomeration 
into UDCh. 
  The formed UDCh have a highly developed surface which in 
many 
cases results in rapid oxidation with air oxygen during the 
washing and drying stages of the fiber (copper, iron). Moreover, 
sometimes local reduction of ions takes place along the length 
of the fiber or in the bulk of a textile fabric which may be 
explained as being due to non-uniform distribution of 
chemo-sorption groups and hence metal ions throughout the 
sample. Apparently, formation of UDCh on chemo-sorption fibers 
has limitations in metal ion concentrations within the bulk and 
on the surface of the fiber. 
  Using Vion KN-1 fiber as a chemo-sorption fiber and sodium 
dithionite as reducing agent, a nickel-containing fiber was 
prepared which has satisfactory physical-mechanical and thermal 
characteristics. An estimate of the particle sizes of the 
prepared UDCh was made. It was observed that for 8 percent (by 
weight) nickel content in the fiber, particle size varied from 
500 to 800 nm, while at 12 percent [nickel content], it varied 
from 700 to 12 nm. X-ray structural studies showed that the 
observed UDCh are not monolithic, but rather aggregates of 
smaller sized particles. 
  The electrical conductivity and magneto-electric 
characteristics of the fibers were determined. It was 
established that at 3 percent or more nickel content (by 
weight), the electrical conductivity of the fibers is constant 
and comprises 2-3 Cm. At over 8 percent metal content (by 
weight) or greater, and 8.5 GHz frequency, a marked increase in 
real and imaginary components of complex dielectric and magnetic 
permeability of the fibers is observed (_e_[.sup]'[/], 
_e_[.sup]``[/] &gt;  4; Ê[.sup]'[/], Ê[.sup]''[/] &gt; 
1). 
  Promising areas of application of the fibers and textile 
fabrics made from them are being considered.

<F P=106> [Article by G. P. Kostikova, D. V. Korolkov, and Yu. P. </F>
Kostikov; St. Petersburg State University; presented by 
Academician Yu. A. Buslayevyy; UDC 541.67:541.451] 
  [Text] In our previous article [1], we proposed that a 
periodic redox reaction is the basis of high temperature 
conductivity in oxides. It was shown that a system in which such 
a reaction proceeds exhibits all the properties of high 
temperature superconductors (HTSC), and in a number of cases 
(isotope effect, effect of paramagnetic impurities or ionizing 
radiation), the explanation of HTSC properties derived from the 
developed model appears to be more natural than those derived 
from classical positions. In this work, a comparison of 
experimental data on HTSC concentration characteristics with 
results of a thermodynamic analysis of the possibility of the 
occurrence of a periodic redox reaction in an oxide, depending 
on its composition, was conducted in support of this model. 
Required thermodynamic data were taken from [2], and 
calculations of missing values were conducted according to well 
known laws of thermodynamics [3]. 
  The central question consists of whether, on the basis of 
the 
thermodynamic values that characterize a periodic redox 
reaction, one can determine the composition of superconductors 
at which a mamimum effect would be observed. For 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-¯[/], the 
composition parameter is the oxygen index; for 
BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/], it is the 
bismuth index. 
  The condition at which the periodic reaction occurs is, 
naturally, where the change in the Gibbs free energy is equal to 
zero [4]. The actual process in 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-¯[/] is modelled, 
obviously, by the reaction 
Cu[.sub]2[/]O + BaO[.sub]2[/] &lt;--&gt;  2CuO + BaO. 
  The free energy of this reaction oscillates about zero in 
the 
bulk structures of BaO[.sub]1.52[/] and CuO[.sub]0.74[/] 
oxides. When translated to the superconductor formula, this 
yields an oxygen index of 6.76, i.e., superconducting properties 
should appear in the composition 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]6.76[/]. The 
superconducting property dependence of this compound has been 
studied in many works. According to data in [5], superconducting 
properties appear in the composition interval 6.5 - 6.98 (in 
oxygen index values). Later studies [6] have narrowed this 
interval to 6.8 - 7.0 for T[.sub]c[/] = 90 K and 6.6 - 6.75 
for T[.sub]c[/] = 60 K. 
  In the BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
superconductor, where, according to RFE-spectroscopic data, 
Pb[.sup]II[/], Pb[.sup]IV[/], and Bi[.sup]III[/], 
Bi[.sup]V[/] are present, the primary process through which 
electrical current transmission is made possible is the reaction 
PbO + Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] &lt;--&gt;  PbO[.sub]2[/] 
+ Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. 
  The free energy of formation of Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] 
is in the interval 130-150 kcal/mol. Taking this value into 
account, the free energy of this reaction oscillates about zero 
for the composition 
BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/] at x = 
0.16-0.34. Actually, the maximum superconducting properties of 
this compound are observed at x is approximately equal to 0.25 
[7]. It should be noted that these were evaluated for a 
temperature of 298 K. The transition to temperatures 
characteristic for superconductors introduces only insignificant 
corrections. 
  Free energy values were calculated for reactions that model 
processes in more complex systems. The formation of a complex 
oxide, in which the discussed redox reactions occur, uniformly 
affects the thermodynamic properties of all components 
participating in the reaction without affecting their ratio. The 
role of atoms of elements contained in the structure of the 
compounds but that do not participate in the redox reaction (Y 
in the first case, Ba in the second) apparently leads to the 
establishment of a unit cell metric and a temperature dependence 
of the metric that also governs the electron tunneling potential. 
  The developed model allows one to predict combinations of 
elements and the valent forms of their oxides where the periodic 
redox reaction will probably occur. In this regard, S. A. 
Shukarev's hypotheses about how the relative stability of 
various valent forms of a single element depend on 
``isometalloid'' values, which are the free energy of formation 
of the oxide divided by the number of oxygen atoms in the oxide 
[8], are useful. Values of the Gibbs free energy for oxides with 
varying degrees of metal oxidation are presented in table 1. A 
convenient parameter for matching redox pairs is the 
isometalloid difference _D_. Oxides that are either contained 
in 
superconductor structures or are used as alloying dopants and 
for which reliable data on the free energy of formation are 
available are presented in table 1. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-10A>      Table 1. Thermodynamic characteristics of oxides. </FIG>


  If one were to start from the premise that a superconductor 
is a system with periodic redox reactions, then it is clear that 
the appearance of superconducting properties may be expected for 
redox pairs whose _D_ values agree in sign and are close in 
magnitude. In this case, the free energy of the reaction will be 
equal to zero for equimolar ratios of oxidized and reduced 
forms. The maximum electron tunneling potential should be at 
precisely these concentrations. Based on this, one may conclude 
that for the pair Cu[.sup]I[/]-Cu[.sup]II[/] (a required 
component for all superconductors with maximum T[.sub]c[/]), 
favorable partners for occurrence of the periodic redox reaction 
will be the VO-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 
V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/], and 
CoO-Co[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/] pairs. In the case of chromium 
oxide, equilibrium would be strongly shifted from the equimolar 
ratio; therefore, the probability of occurrence of the redox 
reaction in mixed oxides of copper and chromium would be 
significantly lower. In mixed oxides of iron and copper, the 
type of periodic reaction discussed here is generally impossible. 
  Let us turn our attention to the system of mixed oxides of 
iron and tin. Based on our hypotheses, one would expect the 
appearance of superconducting properties in the system 
FeO-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SnO-SnO[.sub]2[/] or in 
more complex systems with the participation of components that 
are inert with respect to the redox reaction, e.g., yttrium in 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-¯[/]. 
  In such a manner, the thermodynamics of possible redox 
reactions in the discussed compounds within the framework of 
hypotheses about the periodic reaction allow one not only to 
calculate experimentally confirmed compositions of already known 
superconducting oxides, but also to predict new oxide systems 
with high temperature superconductivity.

  [Text] The congress took place in Minsk on 24-29 July 1993 
and was devoted to chemical problems in ecology. In proclaiming 
legal ecological responsibility over the former USSR we have 
recently become more outspoken in judgment concerning ecological 
problems, but unfortunately there is little that can be done 
under the conditions of the deepening crises of our political 
and economic systems. 
  Despite all difficulties, the number of participants 
attending the congress in Minsk exceeded 1400 (this included 764 
from Russia, 156 from Ukraine, 434 from Belorus, 23 from 
Uzbekistan, 15 from Kazakhstan, and 59 from ``distant'' regions). 
  Academician L. M. Sushchenya (Academy of Sciences, Belorus) 
represented the organizational committee, Academician O. M. 
Nefedov (Russian Academy of Sciences) was president, and Doctor 
of Chemical Sciences V. N. Makatun was the learned secretary. 
  The congress in the overfilled cinema theater ``Oktyabr'' 
opened with brief introductory remarks by Academician O. M. 
Nafedov. In a salutary speech to the participants of the 
congress, Representative of Supreme Soviet Belorus Republic S. 
S. Shushkevich sharply underscored the important function of the 
meeting as a well known counterweight to the disintegrating 
processes taking place over the expanse of the former USSR, and 
emphasized the impossibility of solving ecological problems 
without the combined forces of scientists and practitioners. 
  Eight reports were heard in five plenary sessions. Probably, 
the most interesting was the report of Academician V. A. 
Koptyuga: ``Chemistry and Stable Development: Status and 
Prospects After the UN Conference in Rio de Janeiro,'' not only 
in its depth of analysis of the materials presented at this 
conference, but also in pointing out the impossibility of any 
single SNG government to solve individually ecological problems 
the extent of which continue to grow as a result of conflicts 
within the entire network. V. P. Kukhar's report on the 
ecological consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear 
Power Plant to a large extent confirm this position. S. V. 
Golubkov presented his views on possible ways for integrating 
the chemical complex of SNG nations, while G. A. Yagodin 
examined problems in ecological education in schools and higher 
institutions. 
  In all, about 800 reports were presented in 7 sections. The 
reports were arranged in the following manner: 
  1. Research and control of ecological state of the 
environment. -- 26/110* 
  2. New waste-free and low waste technologies of chemical 
production. -- 28/140 
  3. Ecological problems in functioning of large scale 
industrial and agricultural complexes. -- 23/63 
  4. Decontamination of industrial wastes and restoration of 
natural systems.-- 88/145 
  5. Migration and accumulation of chemical, radioactive, and 
biological pollutants in the environment. -- 23/62 
  6. Problems in ecological education in public education. -- 
30/35 
  7. Medical-chemical problems in ecology. -- 17/15 
  *Numerator -- oral, denominator -- standing reports. 
  Some of the reports were not heard as a result of the 
absence 
of the authors, since not everyone could find the means to pay 
the considerable amounts needed to make such a trip. There were 
only a few young participants in the congress. This category 
undoubtedly is in need of financial support from the organizers 
of any symposium. 
  It is impossible to give a detailed analysis of the reports. 
We will limit ourselves only to brief summaries of the questions 
considered at each section. 
  ``Research and control of ecological state of the 
environment'' (Yu. A. Zolotov, V. V. Sukhan, and Yu. M. 
Luzhkov). A significant portion of the reports in this section 
was devoted to the scientific fundamentals of the 
chemical-analytical control of the environment, development and 
improvement of systems for ecological monitoring of atmospheric 
and aquatic media, and new approaches to the 
ecological-analytical control of potable, waste, and sea waters. 
The important role of reliability in analytical information in 
deciding ecological problems was underscored. A number of 
reports were devoted to general problems in the analysis of 
entire groups of compounds: pesticides, heavy metals, phenols 
and chlorophenols, nitrates, mercury, arsenic, benzpyrenes, 
petroleum products, chlorinated compounds, and others. Other 
reports threw light on the status of analytical control in a 
number of concrete places, for example the radiational 
arrangements in the Belorus Republic, monitoring in the Komi 
Republic, and dioxines in Baykal. On the whole, most of the 
attention was devoted to water analysis. In one of the basic 
reports (Prof. V. Merts), an overall review was presented on 
indicators for evaluating water quality, which included a 
detailed examination of the indicator for content of 
halogen-containing compounds. In his opinion, the role of 
overall indicators keeps growing with the increasing number of 
substances to which PDK [maximum permissible concentration] 
norms are assigned. The use and development of instrumental 
methods of analysis was covered in reports on gas, liquid, and 
ion chromatography, UV- and IF-spectroscopy, 
chromato-mass-spectrometry, gas sensors, EPR-spectroscopy, 
chemiluminescence, potentiometry, and atom- adsorption 
spectroscopy. However, it became evident from the reports that 
more traditional methods of chemical analysis, such as 
extraction and sorption methods of concentrating and enriching 
initial probes, are widely used. The reports presented 
characterized the broad spectrum of approaches to the problem of 
selecting samples, concentrating them, identifying the 
compositions and making quantitative analyses. Several reports 
were devoted to problems in creating data banks on ecological 
control. 
  ``New waste-free and low waste technologies of chemical 
production'' A. M. Kutepov and G. F. Tereshchenko. Here, a 
number of essentially new approaches were presented on the 
creation of technology for chemical products, particularly: 
approaches to the creation of ecologically clean chemical 
production, and power plants not using mined organic stocks, 
non-traditional chemical reactors based on power facilities 
where the reacting and mass-exchange processes are combined, and 
an examination of organized processes and streams in chemical 
technology and energy-cryotechnology. A great number of reports 
was devoted to the development of effective catalysts and 
catalytic processes for converting methane, for protecting and 
restoring the environment, decontaminating industrial off gases 
under non-stationary conditions, and catalytic reduction of 
nitroaromatic compounds. A number of reports was devoted to 
ecologically safe technology for chemical refining of cellulose, 
enrichment of non-ferrous metal ores, ecological problems of 
chemical-metallurgical processes and the refining of other 
minerals. Important problems in the development of equipment for 
chemical processes were covered in reports on energy-saving 
filtration, membranes, mass exchange, separating equipment and 
the combining of several operations and processes into a single 
technological cycle. Typical applied problems included the 
refining of mineral ores, derivation of metals and salts, 
synthesis of organic substances, polymeric compositions, and 
practically the entire spectrum of chemical products of modern 
technology slanted toward decreasing wastes, saving energy and 
chemicals. Especially interesting was an information-modeling 
system for the development of ecologically clean chemical 
production. 
  ``Ecological problems in functioning of large scale 
industrial and agricultural complexes'' (I. I. Lishtvan and A. 
A. Solovyanov). Reports in this section concerned ecological 
problems involved in the optimization of technological life 
support systems of cities, evaluation of risks as determined by 
newly created systems for predicting extreme ecological 
situations, examination of methods for approaching the 
improvement of ecological situations resulting from 
electroplating production, and rubber products production. Also 
examined were the complex ecological problems associated with 
large scale chemical complexes (Mogilev Production Association, 
``Khimvolokno''), that of an entire region (Tulskaya Oblast), 
and the hydrochemistry of Belorussian rivers. 
  Many reports were devoted to the interaction between 
introducing to agrochemical systems items such as fertilizers, 
growth stimulants, trace elements; the appraisal of 
morphological and agrophysical properties of soils used to raise 
plants and animals; methods for evaluating the dangers of using 
chemical and petroleum-based products and their effects on the 
quality of subterranean waters, the atmosphere, and food 
products. 
  ``Decontamination of industrial wastes and restoration of 
natural systems'' (V. S. Soldatov and K. I. Zamarayev). Reports 
in this section concerned general approaches to the strategy of 
developing methods for cleansing various media from technogenic 
industrial interaction, colloidal-chemical purification methods, 
and features of sorption treatment of water and air using 
natural and synthetic sorbents, (including nitrates and heavy 
metal salts). A large number of reports was devoted to the 
description of concrete technological processes for treating 
water and air using catalytic methods, membrane aeration, 
flotation, low temperature plasma, flame treatment, and other 
methods of all types of chemical products, wastes, and 
materials. Also examined were methods for preparing and the 
properties of various sorption-filtration materials used in 
treating fibers, ion exchangers, ceramic membranes, sorbents 
made of rice, straw, natural and synthetic zeolites, liquid 
membranes, and others. 
  ``Migration and accumulation of chemical, radioactive, and 
biological pollutants in the environment'' (V. N. Kukhar and Ye. 
P. Petryayev). Although the basic trend of reports 
presented at this section bore an organization character and 
included the concepts of the State program RF on rehabilitation 
of the Ural region, migration of radionucleides, their status in 
aqueous media, their distribution in soil and plant cover, 
features of their migrations in aeration of rocks and their 
accumulation in natural waters, a major portion of the material 
referred to the catastrophe at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station and the study of its aftereffects. Other reports in the 
section dealt with the evaluation of Sr[.sup]90[/] in the 
organisms of residents of Belorus, chromium contamination 
resulting from oil refineries in West Texas, migrations of heavy 
metals in Dnieper river waters, pesticide contamination of 
Belorussian territory, vertical migration of technogenic 
contamination in Southern Ural soils, the ecological state of 
Baykal, and other concrete objects. In several reports problems 
were examined on the ecological-geochemical evaluation of the 
interactions of urbanized territories on river systems, 
accumulation of heavy metals in plants growing in industrial 
zones, geochemistry and ecology of sea water, migration and 
segregation of physical-chemical admixtures in the waters of the 
world ocean, migrations of sulfur, organic pollution, 
phosphorus, and fluorine. 
  ``Problems in ecological education in public education'' (F. 
N. Kaputskiy, P. D. Sarkisov, and G. A. Yagodin). The reports in 
this section dealt with tendencies in the development of 
ecological education in the world, the Belorus Republic, the 
technical vuzes of Russia, secondary schools and universities of 
Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. Doubtless, the work of this 
section deserves separate presentation as a result of the 
striving to create a system of direct ecological education. 
Experience in the useful familiarization of school children with 
control of the environment and food products was gathered at St. 
Petersburg University (``Center for Search and Maintenance of 
Talents''). A number of reports examined problems in the 
pleasure-aesthetic and ecological education of school children, 
integration of ecological knowledge into the system of chemical 
education, preparation of specialist-ecologists in vuzes, 
multi-level systems of active chemical-ecological education, and 
the utilization of search systems to teach one to solve 
ecological problems. 
  ``Medical-chemical problems in ecology'' (A. V. Shabrov, V. 
V. Strelko, and V. A. Pertsev). The reports in this section 
examined problems in the study of the effects of anthropogenic 
environmental factors on the human organism, the presence of any 
connection between the chemical composition and health of 
people, the study of protective mechanisms of the organism 
against the action of technogenic chemical factors, and the 
effects of toxic action of nitrites on mammalian organisms. In 
other reports concrete examples were examined on the connection 
between technogenic interaction and human health in regions of 
biotechnological and petrochemical production, the effects of 
the presence of nitrites, nitrates, lead acetate, the creation 
of several sources for the prophylaxis and treatment of 
poisoning, the use of enzymes for purification and bioindicators 
in analysis. The congress included two round tables: ``Megapolis 
- - problems associated with living in large municipal 
agglomerations,'' and ``Chemistry-Nature-Man.'' The congress 
also included for the first time an exhibit ``Ekokhim-93,'' 
which displayed devices for ecological control, monitoring 
systems, flow diagrams for ecologically safe production of 
chemical products, gas cleansing systems, waste waters, and 
others. The most interesting exhibits were demonstrated by 
institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and its 
affiliates, Beloruss Academy of Sciences, the companies 
``Perkin-Elmer,'' ``Varian,'' ``Shimadzu,'' ``Anatessek,'' ``Ar 
SiMa,'' and the Angar Petroleum Combine. 
  While the congress as whole was well organized, some of the 
shortcomings common to our scientific conferences should be 
noted, such as the lack of space for demonstrations associated 
with the standing reports and their careless makeup. Throughout 
the world, however, standing reports are on a par with oral 
reports. Well presented report themes were listed in 
alphabetical order beginning with the first author's last name, 
and not by subject matter. This seriously inhibits using themes 
as a basis for examining materials of the conference according 
to specific problems. A Federation of Chemical Societies imeni 
D. I. Mendeleyev was formed at the XV Mendeleyev Congress; it 
included the majority of former republican chemical societies of 
the former VKhO [All-Union Chemical Society]. A motion was 
adopted to register the FKhO imeni D. I. Mendeleyev in the 
Belorus republic. Academician I. I. Lishtvan, Belorus Academy of 
Sciences, was elected president, while the administrative and 
organizational work will be carried out by the General 
Secretariat from Minsk. The congress concluded with the adoption 
of a declaration in which attention was directed to need for 
coordination of forces for the purpose of preventing unfavorable 
regional, inter-regional, and global ecological changes 
developing as a result of anthropogenic interaction on nature, 
the major portion of which is related to chemical substances and 
processes. The XV Mendeleyev Congress was a great and important 
event in science. Individual contacts, meetings and discussions 
confirm the need for continuing and restoring broken contacts of 
scientists, regardless of the difficult conditions of existence 
of most of them, especially in Russia. At the congress, the 
conviction was confirmed regarding the primary significance of 
ecological aspects for the existence of humanity and the 
preservation of living means, as well as for the steady 
development of various countries and individuals in health and 
suitable quality of life. Chemistry itself, the chemical 
processes and production of the entire chemical complex, 
developed chemical products and materials are capable of not 
only creating ecological problems, but also of effectively 
solving them to a large degree, while a reasoned and well 
thought out technical policy can prevent them and thereby lower 
ecological stress.

Prospecting; UDC 622.27.001.5] 
  [Text] A department of exploitation of deposits of rare and 
radioactive metals was organized on the initiative of professor, 
Doctor of Technical Sciences G. N. Popov at the Moscow Institute 
of Nonferrous Metals and Gold in 1949. The tasks of the 
department included training mining engineers having facility 
with the specific features of underground exploitation of 
uranium and rare metal deposits and scientific personnel of a 
high qualification in this field, and providing methodological 
assistance to mining enterprises and to planning and research 
institutes. 
  In 1963 the department was transferred to the Moscow 
Institute for Geological Prospecting, where to this date it has 
been training mining engineers specializing in underground and 
combined exploitation of ore deposits. 
  Students are taught on the basis of individual training 
plans 
distinguished by a high volume of training in geological 
disciplines, in the use of geophysical methods in mining, and in 
the specific features of combatting occupational diseases and 
protecting and making integrated use of the subsoil. Training of 
mining engineers specifically for exploitation of stratified 
deposits was started in 1989. 
  Each year the department accepts two groups of students. 
Training of foreign students was started in 1992 (India, Libya, 
Chad, Bulgaria etc.), in connection with which a student group 
for the training of specialists of a broad profile--mineral 
deposit exploitation--was organized. 
  Forty-seven doctorate dissertations were defended, 145 
candidates of technical sciences were matriculated, and over 
3,160 mining engineers were trained at the department. 
  The multifaceted activity of the department's collective 
embraces a wide range of work. 
  One of the most important directions in the work of the 
department's collective is supporting the training process with 
textbooks and training aids of a modern scientific and technical 
level. 
  The department is constantly working among students to 
attract them to scientific research. Students are prepared for 
independent research, and they present reports at scientific 
conferences within the framework of a student mining circle. 
  The scientific interests of all instructors, associates and 
graduate students are oriented on developing and improving the 
procedures of underground and surface mining of nonferrous, rare 
metal and diamond deposits. 
  Fundamental research completed by the department's 
collective 
since 1963 is described below. 
  In the field of underground exploitation of mineral 
deposits. A complex of research aimed at improving the 
procedures of mining Altay polymetallic deposits was carried out 
under the leadership of Prof. G. N. Popov, merited worker of 
science and technology. 
  A broad complex of scientific research aimed at 
substantiating and creating new procedures and equipment for 
hydraulic transportation of mineral raw materials for a number 
of enterprises in rare metal industry and ferrous metallurgy was 
carried out. 
  The technical possibility and feasibility of drilling 
conveyor extraction of ore from thin sections of sandy clay 
uranium deposits were substantiated. Systems of descending 
layered excavation employing hardening filling for exploitation 
of uranium deposits presenting a fire danger were actively 
introduced. 
  A cycle of work to substantiate sensible use the reserves of 
ore deposits was carried out under the leadership of Prof. V. A. 
Simakov. In this case the concept ``sensible use of reserves'' 
was refined by the inclusion of the time and intensity of 
developing deposits into it, in addition to full extraction of 
useful components in the entire extraction-processing cycle. A 
procedure was proposed for optimizing development of mineral 
extraction, in which the intensity and time of deposit 
development ensuring minimum outlays on acquisition of the end 
product at a prescribed production volume over the years of the 
period of optimization, within the bounds of allocated materials 
and monetary resources, are determined. 
  A new indicator was introduced to describe the quality of 
development of deposits in terms of the degree of fouling of ore 
by enclosing rock--the coefficient of introduction of enclosing 
rock, which is the ratio of introduced rock to extinguished 
reserves. In distinction from the known dilution coefficient, 
its magnitude does not depend on loss of ore during mining. 
  A procedure of optimizing the level of losses and dilution 
during mining based on compensational outlays to obtain metal 
underproduced in one of the variants was created with regard for 
the proposed coefficient. Solving this problem on the basis of 
the profit from a tonne of diluted reserves, where metal prices 
are established at the level of long-term marginal costs, is a 
particular case of this procedure. The results of this research 
made up part of a project for which the group of authors, 
including Prof A. V. Simakov, was awarded the State Prize for 
1983. 
  Research on generalizing the minimum industrial and flank 
content of the useful component at operating and new deposits 
had important significance to lead and zinc industry. The 
impermissible scatter of their values was revealed. A proposed 
means of ordering the values of these indicators at deposits 
provided for a significant savings of resources. 
  Research on the possibilities of grade-specific mining 
showed 
that enterprises frequently do not mine ore by grades, which 
significantly reduces the economic potential. 
  Scientific research is acquiring special importance to 
mining 
enterprises in the time of transition to market relations, when 
allocation of production reserves on the basis of sensible use 
of the reserves of deposits in terms of the time and intensity 
of deposit development, loss and dilution of ore during mining, 
establishment of requirements on the ore, grade-specific and 
selective mining, and exploitation equipment and procedures are 
becoming especially important. 
  The procedures for developing complexly structured ore 
deposits by an underground method were developed under the 
leadership of Prof. I. A. Kovalev: 

  -  a phased method of conducting scientific research when 
planning and introducing new mineral extraction procedures and 
improving existing ones; 
  -  a complex of measures for improving systems of sublevel 
breaking making it possible to preserve the stability of worked 
rock in the course of developing chamber reserves; 
  -  a procedure for removing reserves without leaving chamber 
pillars behind, which raises the effectiveness of developing 
steep deposits of low and moderate thickness with insufficiently 
stable enclosing rock; 
  -  a scheme of preparing a story in which it is divided into 
blocks with geometric parameters determined by the stability of 
the worked rock mass; 
  -  a means of directed crack formation along the outer boundary 
of 
a chamber to reduce the seismic action of explosions. 

    In the field of open-cut exploitation of mineral 
deposits. 
  The following were developed under the leadership of Prof. 
Yu. I. Anistratov: 

  -  a special procedure of open-cut exploitation of diamond 
deposits in Yakutia, where the quarry flanks are steep (the Mir 
and Aykhal quarries, the Internatsionalnaya and Udachnaya 
tubes), for which Yu. I. Anistratov was awarded the USSR State 
Prize; 
  -  a procedure for developing deposits to a considerable depth 
(over 500 m) in stories with intermediate quarry flanks close to 
the extinction angle (introduced at a number of quarries in 
nonferrous metallurgy); 
  -  an explosion-less procedure for mining crystalline raw 
material 
at kimberlite deposits of Yakutia and Arkhangel Oblast using 
drilling cutter-loaders; 
  -  a method of laying out quarries with a personal computer 
using 
standard elements; 
  -  an energy-based method for selecting and justifying full 
mechanization of mining operations at quarries; 
  -  a means of exposing working horizons of mountain quarries 
with 
underground workings (Khibiny, Tyrnyauz); 
  -  a method of evaluating the influence of open-cut mining on 
the 
environment, and of developing procedures providing for 
ecological balance. 

    The following were developed under the leadership of 
professors B. P. Yumatov and Zh. V. Bunin: 

  -  a sensible and safe procedure of open-cut mining for 
combined (surface-underground) exploitation of ore deposits 
(objects of research and introduction--the Norilsk Mining and 
Metallurgical Works, the Tselinnyy Mining and Chemical Works, 
and the Tyrnyauz VMK [not further identified]); 
  -  procedural directives on establishing requirements on 
minerals 
in the course of exploitation of ore deposits by the open-cut 
method (objects of research and introduction--the Sorsk 
Molybdenum Works, the Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentration 
Works, the Agarak Mining and Concentration Works); 
  -  a procedure and a package of applications programs for 
planning 
the basic parameters of quarries with a personal computer (for 
use in a system for automated planning and control of quarries): 
the outer and intermediate boundaries of quarries, the sensible 
direction for developing the work zone, and the calendar plan of 
mining operations (objects of research--the Sorsk Molybdenum 
Works and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Works); 
  -  the theoretical principles of planning phased development and 
reconstruction of ore quarries (the Sorsk Molybdenum Works, and 
the Muruntau quarry of the Navoi Mining and Concentration 
Works).

  Key words: spacecraft, nuclear power plant, heat emitting 
reactor-converter, nuclear-pumped laser set. 
  According to estimates, as a result of accidental and in 
many 
cases intentional exhausts there are now over 3.5 million 
artificial objects and particles in the circumterrestrial layer 
of outer space. Such a cosmic ``debris'' presents a danger to 
astronauts as well as to spacecraft. 
  Passive methods and active methods of cleaning outer space 
of 
this debris are now being investigated. Removal of debris 
fragments by active methods requires use of devices which detect 
particles and impart either energy or momentum to them so as to 
ensure their deceleration and descent from the orbit. This 
problem can be solved in a cardinal way, namely by vaporization 
of fragments with the aid of high-energy systems. Such a system 
may be a spacecraft which carries an electric reaction engine 
which propels it, a nuclear power plant which supplies power to 
the engine, and a laser set which imparts energy to a particle 
in space. 
  Under consideration is the possibility of using for this 
purpose a spacecraft which carries a nuclear power plant 
consisting of a heat emitting reactor-converter and a built-in 
laser set with nuclear pumping /1/. 
  The basal nuclear power plant has the following main 
technical and technological characteristics /2/: 
  1. Use of heat emitting fast-neutron reactor-converter with 
a 
moderating reflector and with an emitter shell formed by 
tungsten single crystals. 
  2. Use of a high-temperature cooling system with lithium as 
the coolant. 
  3. Transmission of the heat ejected during the thermodynamic 
cycle through the surface of a cooler-radiator consisting of 
sodium heat exchanger tubes. 
  4. Use of only one structural material, a niobium alloy, 
throughout the entire nuclear power plant. 
  5. Layout of the nuclear power plant based on the radiation 
path principle, with use of shadow-type radiation protection. 
  One envisages a compound reactor regulation system 
consisting 
of rotating cylinders inside the lateral reflector in addition 
to control elements and protective devices ensuring radiation 
safety directly inside the reactor-converter core. Inside the 
core is also located a protective nuclear safety system 
consisting of devices which absorb neutrons and ensuring nuclear 
safety in all emergency situations, these devices being 
withdrawn from the core into their functional orbit only before 
the power is turned on. The nuclear power plant is both started 
and cooled by a startup cooling system which ensures economical 
melting of lithium in the tubes by the heat coming from the 
reactor-converter during startup. 
  An array of laser cells is mounted in the lateral reflector 
of the heat emitting reactor-converter, its electric power 
rating being 150 kw. The reactor generates both the voltage 
necessary for sustaining the discharge in the discharge chamber 
of the CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and the neutron flux used for 
boost-excitation of the active laser medium. Each cell is a 
discharge chamber, a 700 mm long cylindrical tube 110 mm in 
diameter, its geometrical axis coinciding with optical axis of 
the laser. The electrodes are disposed along that optical axis 
and produce a transverse discharge, perpendicular to the 
direction of gas flow. The active medium is a 
CO[.sub]2[/]-N[.sub]2[/]-He mixture driven through the 
discharge tube, its temperature and pressure at the inlet being 
500 K and 4500 Pa respectively. A laser set with an exit beam 
power of 15 kw requires 10 such cells inside the lateral 
reflector. The cells can be cooled either by an independent 
cooling system or by a cooling system combined with the cooling 
system for the protective shields. It is also feasible to use a 
cooling system withe heat exchanger tubes. 
  Design estimates indicate that the mass of such a nuclear 
power plant with an electric power rating of 150 kw will not 
exceed nine tons. 
  Estimates regarding the effectiveness radius of such a power 
plant indicate the following. Inasmuch as most of the artificial 
objects in outer space are made of aluminum and are within the 
0.1-10 mm size range, they require correspondingly 0.00023-200 
kJ of energy for vaporization. 
  Owing to divergence of the laser beam, the intensity of 
radiation reaching the surface of a particle will depend on the 
distance to that surface. The intensity of radiation incident on 
a particle is 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-17A>      FORMULA </FIG>


  The intensity levels (watts) of incident radiation from a 15 
kW laser, depending on the radius of a particle (cm) and on the 
distance to a particle (km), are listed is the Table. The 
numbers in parentheses represent the time (seconds) needed for 
vaporization of a particle: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-17B>      FORMULA </FIG>


  Evidently such a system is very effective at least within 
the 
10-30 km range of distances. 
  Such systems operate now in radiation-safe orbits within the 
800-2000 km range of altitudes, where most of the mass of debris 
fragments is located. The rocket-carrier ``Proton'' puts a 
spacecraft with a dry mass of 11.2 tons into a circular orbit at 
800 km altitude, whereupon the nuclear power plant on the 
spacecraft is turned on so that search for and vaporization of 
particles can begin. The spacecraft then moves from 800 km to 
2000 km altitude and back to 800 km altitude with an only small 
change of the orbit inclination angle, propelled by the 150 kW 
electric reaction engine with xenon as the working medium. It 
takes the spacecraft about 960 h to make one such sweep and, 
with a 5-6 tons supply of xenon, it can make 40-50 sweeps during 
its 5 years long life. Complete removal of fragments within the 
800-2000 km layer requires 8-10 such spacecrafts.

  [Abstract] The inadequacy of the probabilistic-statistical 
approach to data processing is shown in a geophysical study of 
wells. The drawbacks of this approach are discussed in detail. 
The proposed alternative is the treatment of measured parameters 
as fuzzy numbers and the determination of the main parameters of 
oil- and gas-bearing strata (obtained by solving petrophysical 
equations) as solutions of fuzzy systems of algebraic equations. 
The appropriate mathematical vehicle is developed. The problem 
of solving a fuzzy linear system of algebraic equations is 
reduced to a nonlinear programming problem. Figure 1; referenc

  [Abstract] This article proposes an approach to the 
construction of diagnostic expert systems based on a special 
matrix representation of fuzzy predicates in a test model of a 
subject field. A sectioned matrix is a fuzzy analog of a 
conjunctive normal form of predicate representation. One may use 
rules, examples, and counterexamples to form the knowledge base. 
Fuzzy rules are used to interpret elements of a common nonfuzzy 
set. The most important assertions of the logic of predicates 
can be generalized to the fuzzy case. The diagnostics problem is 
understood to be the acquisition of information on possible 
values of some indicator if there is data on the values of other 
indicators. The basis of logical deduction is the operation of 
fuzzy resolution, which is used to find sample disjunctions. An 
expert system shell, EPID, is implemented on the basis of the 
formalisms presented here. Figures 3; references 12: 6 Russian, 
6 Western.

  [Abstract] This article develops a model of fuzzy 
probabilistic logic which generalizes the Nilsson probabilistic 
logic theory. Nilsson's theory is described, and its limitations 
discussed. The main role in this model is played by the concept 
of possibility distribution and a method of determining the 
distribution from a single knowledge base. This enables one to 
include a consideration of subjective and inexact expert 
information. The general properties of this model are studied. 
The complexity of calculating the possibility distribution 
increases exponentially with the size of the knowledge base . 
Moreover, one may only use a small part of the knowledge base or 
only some of the deductions from a portion of the knowledge 
base. This method is therefore inefficient for large knowledge 
bases. Semantic aspects of the logic are studied and form the 
basis for efficient approximate methods of calculating 
possibility distributions. The model of fuzzy probabilistic 
logic is actually a family of different logics; aspects common 
to the entire family are studied. References 3 (Western).

  [Abstract] Dynamic knowledge is represented in terms of 
formulas for the temporal separation of events. Both textual and 
graphic descriptions of the formulas are given. The semantics of 
the formulas is described. A modification of the rule for 
SLD-resolution is the foundation for logical deduction using the 
formulas. Dynamic knowledge processing presents the opportunity 
to use semantics more flexibly by controlling deduction with 
dynamic formation of additional conditions limiting the 
combinatorial search of event elements. The recalculation of 
attributes is proposed as a way of controlling the search for a 
logical deduction. The state of the deduction is represented by 
a proof tree, and the values of node attributes can be 
recalculated by following different paths through the tree. The 
authors used Turbo Pascal to develop a prototype expert system 
of dynamic analys is using the principles presented in this 
article. Work is continuing on this project: the authors are 
creating a more flexible graphic user interface and a subsystem 
to automate the formation of dynamic knowledge bases. Figure 1;

  Having discussed the problems associated with the current 
state and development of computing equipment in Ukraine, the 
scientific and practical seminar considers it expedient: 
  1. To create in Ukraine a national profit-making industry 
for computing equipment and micro-electronics as the basis for 
implementation of the top priority state directive ``Promising 
Information Technologies, Complex Automat ion Devices, and 
Communication Systems'' (Resolution No. 2705-XII of the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine dated 16 October 1992). 
  2. To support Resolution No. 61 of the Presidium of the ASU 
dated 3 March 1993 and the resolution of the Interdepartmental 
Conference of 19 March 1993 on problems of informatization in 
Ukraine regarding the development of the ``Concept of 
Informatization of Ukrainian Society'' and the creation to this 
end of the Interdepartmental Council on Informatization. 
  3. For the State Committee on Science and Technologies, the 
ASU, the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of the 
Machine Industry to develop the ``Concept of the Development of 
Computing Equipment in Ukraine'' and to submit it for the 
approva l of the Cabinet of Ministers. In the development of 
this document: 

  -  to use the ``Main Points of State Scientific and Te 
chnical Policy in the Area of the Development of Computing 
Equipment in Ukraine'' developed by this seminar (see below) as 
a foundation, as well as the factual material presented in the 
reports and papers; 
  -  to develop a proposal for the creation of an All-Ukraine 
corporation (or some other progressive form of organization) 
based on enterprises and organizations in Ukraine that produce 
computing equipment; 
  -  to comprehensively examine all forms of information 
processing 
(independent of the area of application), including computing 
equipment for the automation of control systems for 
technological processes, fo r defense, special applications, 
etc.; 
  -  to develop a list of primary standards (laws of the Supreme 
Council, decrees of the Council of Ministers, etc.) needed for 
the informatization of Ukraine, including the development of a 
domestic computing equipment industry; 
  -  to develop proposals directed toward the creation of a 
domestic 
computing equipment industry with a consideration of the top 
priority of developing methodological foundations, methods and 
software tools for software engineering, increasing the 
professional level of programmers, state support of the 
formation of a market infrastructure, resolution of legal 
issues, standardization, etc.; 
  -  to develop proposals to create a state system of maintenance 
and repair, inc luding the routine supply of spare parts, 
components, and materials to service enterprises; 
  -  to develop a list of information technologies in areas of 
activity pertaining to primary informatization, automation, and 
communication, as well as a list of computing equipment needed 
for their implementation; 
  -  to clearly divide the needed computing equipment by means of 
satisfying the requirements of Ukraine: domestic production, 
joint production, and import; 
  -  to analyze and correct existing 
programs of the State Committee on Science and Technologies, 
the ASU, the Ministry of the Machine Industry, the Ministry of 
Communication, the Ministry of Defense, and other ministries 
and departments on computing equipment and electronics in order 
to concentrate financial, material and technical resources on 
promising and competitive projects; 
  -  to develop proposals to create a network of certified 
computing 
equipment centers, including imported equipment.

microcircuits in Ukraine (at the Kvazar or Rodon plants), which 
would enable Ukrainian computer manufacturing enterprises to 
provide their own elemental base at a European level. 
  13. It is considered expedient to conduct regular scientific 
and practical seminars on computing equipment. To ask the 
Elektronmash computer production ass ociation to expand (in an 
established order) the materials of the scientific and 
practical seminar. 
  ``Main Points of State Scientific and Technical 
Policy in the Area of the Development of Computing Equipment in 
Ukraine.'' 
  This document was developed in the process of composing the 
``Concepts of the Development of Computing Equipment in 
Ukraine'' (version 2-92) which was included in the draft 
``Concepts of the Rapid Development of the Machine Building 
Industry of Ukraine ( decree No. 32 of the State Committee on 
Science and Technologies dated 17 Jun 92) as part of the 
section titled ``Instrument Building.'' '' 
  The general governmental significance of the computing 
equipment subdivision was affirmed by resolution No. 2705-XII 
of the Supreme Council of Ukraine dated 16 Oct 92, which 
defined ``promising information technologies, comprehensive 
automation devices, and communication systems'' as a top 
priority area of science and technology in Ukraine. The hardware 
and software base for this area is computing equipment and 
micro-electronics. 
  The purpose of this document is to develop the foundations 
of state technical policy on the creation in Ukraine of a 
profit-making subdivision of computer equipment production. The 
materials of this document should be a component of the 
``Concepts of Informatization of Ukrainian Society.'' 
  This document was examined and approved by the interbranch 
scientific and practical seminar ``Current State and Prospects 
for the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine'' (Kiev, 
17-18 May 1993, State Committee on Science and Technologies, 
ASU, Ministry of the Machine Industry, Ministry of the Economy, 
and Ministry of Defense). 
  A brief analysis of the state of development and 
production of computing equipment in Ukraine 
  1. When Ukraine was part of the former USSR it entered into 
a collaboration with a number of republics (Russia, Ukraine, 
Belorus, Lithuania, and others) including organizations and 
enterprises comprising the union computing equipment industry. 
The production of computing equipment was mainly divided among 
three ministries: The Ministry of Radio Industry, the Ministry 
of Instruments, and the Ministry of Industrial Communication. 
  There was a territorial specialization in which Ukrainian 
organizations and enterprises concentrated on small computers 
(the SM computer), control computers, and peripherals and 
subcomplexes for the SM and YeS computer (the Elektronmash KPO 
[expansion not given], Impuls scientific production 
association, Khartron scientific production association, the 
Scientific Research Institute of Microdevices, the Kvazar joint 
venture, the Print Scientific Research Institute, the Magnit 
joint venture, the Infrakon Central Scientific Research 
Institute, etc). In the last 3-4 years Ukraine has also 
developed a line of low-performance personal computers (consumer 
and educational computers, etc.). 
  The ASU (Cybernetic Center, IPRI, IPME , etc.) have been 
engaged in basic and applied research while participating in 
union projects to develop large specialized computers and 
professional personal computers (the YeS 1800 series) for 
general industrial and special use. 
  The teams at these organizations are now the 
scientific-technical and industrial technological potential of 
Ukraine in computer equipment. However, due to former 
departmental separation, they have not formed an integrated s 
tructure organized for the production of consumer computer 
equipment. 
  2. The existing projects for the development and production 
of computing equipment in Ukraine make it possible to partially 
meet the needs of the domestic market and the CIS market for 
the following types of computing equipment: 

  -  controlling and measuring (real time) computing systems 
(PS series); 
  -  consumer and game computers; 
  -  laptops; 
  -  multiprocessor computers and special processors; 
  -  basic units of personal computers (of the Poisk-2 series); 
  -  terminals for digital communication networks; 
  -  telecommunications equipment (LAN equipment, computer 
communication via telephone and television channels, 
specialized input-output in banking systems,systems based on bar 
codes, etc.); 
  -  fiber optic communication line equipment; 
  -  PROM controllers, numerical programmable control units; 
  -  video terminals and collective use imaging devices; 
  -  devices for the input of graphic information (digitizers, 
scanners); 
  -  devices to output graphic information (plotters) 
  -  tools for interactive communication with a computer (mouse, 
joystick, etc.); 
  -  various types of printers; 
  -  hard disk drives; 
  -  floppy disk drives and floppy disks; 
  -  Kartridzh type magnetic tape drives and magnetic tapes; 
  -  service and auxiliary equipment. 

    The cost of this equipment is a factor of 2-12 less than 
analogous foreign models (for acceptable technical 
specifications). In terms of the elemental base of 
micro-electronics, electronic radio components, and special 
materials, the percentage of computing equipment supplied 
domestic ally is on average 10- 12%. By comparison, the 
figure 
for Western Europe is 30-40%. 
  After a long drop in computing equipment production (1990 to 
the first half of 1992), an almost complete cessation of work 
to develop new products, and suspension of experimental 
production and mass production enterprises, a definite 
rejuvenation has been noted. A number of targeted comprehensive 
programs have been developed and are in operation, including: 

  -  ``The Target Comprehensive Program To Develop Computing 
Equipment in Ukraine in 1992-1995'' (State Defense Industry of 
Machines, Elektronmash KPO, March 1992 ); 
  -  ``Competitive Computing Equipment To Solve the Problems of 
the 
Informatization of Ukraine (State Committee of Science and 
Technologies and the ASU, 1991-1993)''; 
  -  ``Target Program To Develop High-Performance Computing 
Equipment in Ukraine in 1993-1997'' (Ministry of the Machine 
Industry, 1993); 
  -  ``Ukrainian Program To Create and Start Mass Production of 
Network Hardware and Software Based on the MAP/TOP Protocol for 
Comprehensive Automation of Machine Building'' (State Defense 
Industry of Machines, Integral UNPTs [expansion not given], 
1991); 
  -  Elektronika-93 (Ministry of the Machine Industry, Scientific 
Research Institute of Microdevices, 1993). 

    Many claims have been made about these programs, but they 
are in any case providing some direction. More than fifty 
organizations of the ASU, Ministry of the Machine Industry, and 
other departments are participating in them. Moreover, more 
than a dozen computing equipment projects have been implemented 
as part of comprehensive programs in allied fields: instrument 
building, and in the sector of defense computing equipment. 
However, these minute changes in the computing equipment 
subdivision have not yet nullified the profoundly impaired 
macroprocesses that are hindering the development of the 
subdivision, which is evidenced by the following analysis of 
its grave condition. 
  3. Analysis of the current state of research and development 
of computing equipment and the elemental base in Ukraine finds 
it in grave condition. Especially depressing indicators are: 

  -  the absence of a single state technical policy (program 
for development, standards, mechanisms for state regulation and 
attracting private firms and foreign investments). Such 
programs exist in many developed market economy countries in a 
range of national and international programs: PAFE (France), 
  ALVEY (Great Britain), ESPIRIT (the European Community), and 
in Russia (National Programs on Electronics and 
Informatization); 
%the assortment of computing equipment produced in Ukraine is 
insufficient to support information technologies, not only in 
strategic areas (defense, energy, finance, transport, 
communications), but also in general use; 
%the low level of competitiveness on the world market and even 
in the markets of developing countries; the lack of a system of 
standards and certification of domestic and imported products; 
%a low level of self-sufficiency of the elemental base; 
%the low level o f self-sufficiency of basic system and 
application software; %the insufficient level of precision 
electronic and electro-mechanical technologies; 
%the absence of experience and technologies for mass production 
of precision electro-mechanical devices , not only for 
computing equipment, but also for similar products (for 
example, there is no clock factory in Ukraine); 
%the weak development of software tools (CAD) to design VLSI, 
computing equipment, and software; 
%a massive drain of computing specialists to distant foreign 
counties and to other fields in Ukraine. This process is taking 
on an increasingly irreversible and catastrophic nature for the 
development of computing equipment. 
Factors defining the need to develop a domestic computing 
equipment subdivision 

    Under these conditions a subdivision can arise, and trends 
for the reorientation of enterprises in the subdivision to 
another product have already begun, for example to consumer 
goods far from electronic machine building. The idea that 
Ukraine does not need its own computing equipment is being 
heard not only in the halls of well-known western firms present 
in Ukraine (IBM, DEC, SIEMENS, BASF, and others), but also at 
seminars in solid institutes and even state institutions 
involved in the management of science. 
  Let us present some basic arguments for the need to 
strengthen and develop electronic machine building (computing 
equipment, communication, instrument building, etc.) in Ukraine. 
  1) Because the enterprises of basic areas of industry are 
lagging behind technologically, they are not competitive, and 
this makes it impossible in the near future to develop the 
exportation of products to hard currency zones, in order for 
Ukraine to buy all the Western equipment it needs. Ukraine does 
not have export supplies of valuable raw ma terials to provide 
for the annual purchase of 50,000 computers (75-100 million 
dollars). This is the only reason Ukraine is forced to 
independently provide for the main areas of human activity in 
the production of electronic machinery, including computers. 
  2) Ukraine, like the other republics of the former USSR, 
developed in a closed social, economic, and scientific 
production space for a long time. Outdated information 
technologies, methods and forms of representing and processing 
information were created, and a standards base (GOST, OST, etc.) 
was created which was stricter in some ways (for example, on 
the conditions of testing and use) than international 
standards. Thus, at present there is and will continue to 
before some time objective conditions limiting the widespread 
use of imported standard computing equipment in our real 
conditions. In many areas this is simply impossible (military 
equipment, automated control systems for technological 
processes in metallurgy, chemical processing, atomic energy, 
etc.). 
  3) In a number of areas of application (government, defense, 
the economy, finance, etc.) high requirements are placed on 
confidentiality and the protection of information, which is 
impossible to guarantee with imported computing equipment; 
  4) Enhancement of the defense capacity and its maintenance 
on a sufficient level in Ukraine (as an independent state 
outside the bloc) requires a high level of self-sufficiency of 
highly scientific defense equipment, primarily electronic 
equipment (including computers). 
  These factors are sufficient to conclude that development in 
Ukraine of the electronic machine building field, including the 
building of computers, is a prime necessity. However, there are 
other factors which justify the technical, economic and social 
advantages of development of this sector of industry in 
Ukraine, including: 

  -  foreign experience shows that electronic machine building 
is the most profitable (and at the same time ecologically pure) 
field for states with limited natural resources, as is the case 
of Ukraine. In industrially developed countries, the last few 
decades have witnessed active restructuring of the economy due 
to a sharp increase in the rate of growth of industry in 
scientific areas. For example, in the US, since 1977 the 
average annual rate of increase of industrial production was 
2.9%, and in scientific areas, 14%; 
  -  the development of the 
computing field for use in the difficult conditions of defense 
and a number of other industries creates the necessary 
infrastructure (scientific, technical, industrial, etc.) for the 
computer equipment industry and its elemental base, which makes 
it possible to create and develop a competitive consumer and 
industrial computing equipment industry with minimal material 
and labor costs; 
  -  the creation of a domestic computing equipment industry with 
a 
gradual increase in the level of competitiveness in the final 
analysis will substantially reduce hard currency expenditures 
in the state economy; 
  -  the domestic development of computing equipment stimulates 
the 
development of science and the overall intellectual potential 
of the country. 

    Goals and the main points of state policy in the 
development of computing equipment 
  1. The main trend in state policy on the development, 
production, and use of computing equipment is creating a balance 
between meeting state interests in all areas of Ukrainian 
society and real resources, considering the need to preserve the 
scientific and industrial potential which exists in this field. 
  The following are proposed as the main strategic line of 
development of computing equipment in Ukraine (1993-1996 and to 
the year 2000):--to create a profitable domestic computer 
equipment industry concentrated on the production of computing 
equipment, and systems based on this computing equipment, that 
are needed to provide for the primary goals of informatization 
of Ukraine;--to develop domestic computing software in the form 
of the State Open System of Computing Equipment (GOSVT-Ukraine, 
hereafter GOSVT-U) with a consideration of the following 
principles: 

  -  orientation of the assortment of hardware and software in 
GOSVT-U to complete compatibility with international standards; 
  -  the use of modular construction; 
  -  achievement of self-sufficiency in the elemental base of up 
to 
40-50%; 
  -  maximum possible combination of the development and 
production 
of computing equipment for civilian and military use; 

    2. GOSVT-U should be the basic complex for state means of 
informatization, primarily in defense and security, government 
control, health, education, and welfare, taxation, the ecology, 
and other noncommercial areas of activity. Work to create and 
introduce GOSVT-U should mainly be financed by the government. 
Economic and legal mechanisms must be created to stimulate: 

  -  the expansion of the assortment of GOSVT-U modules to 
reduce the import of computing equipment into state information 
systems; 
  -  finding designs which reduce the assortment and/or amount of 
imported components; 
  -  producing GOSVT-U products which are competitive in the 
domestic and foreign markets. 

    3. Detailed analysis and the selection of primary trends for 
the development of computing equipment will be done by 
determining the assortment of equipment for GOSVT-U. However, 
the main guidelines for state policy in this area should be: 

  -  the creation of computing equipment and information 
technologies linked with the defense and security of the nation; 
  -  providing automation equipment to the country's most 
important 
technical facilities (energy, metallurgy, agriculture, ecology, 
etc.); 
  -  production of profitable competitive products; 
  -  the creation of computing equipment in high demand 
(preferably 
with a high degree of domestic labor in the production of these 
products); 
  -  the presence of experience and real stockpiles of computing 
equipment; 
  -  primary provision of state control, fundamental scientific 
research and work related to urgent social needs of 
society. 

    4. World experience has shown that a full computing 
equipment 
self-sufficiency level (80-90%) can only be reached by 
developed and wealthy nations such as the U S, Japan, and 
Western Europe (as a whole). However, the technical and economic 
advantage of international division of specializations holds 
them to a level of self-sufficiency of no greater than 
70%. 
Less wealthy nations (Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy) 
are at a 40-50% level. However, the overall level of 
informatization of these countries is extremely high. Ukraine 
may reach a self-sufficiency level of 30-40% in the next 
3-5 
years. 
  To determine the balance of production of domestic and 
purchase of imported computing equipment (bought from the West 
and the CIS, namely Russia and Belorus) it is expedient to 
consider the following recommendations on the main trends of 
informatization with computing equipment: 



  Purchased advanced foreignequipment      Domestic equipment using 

based on current platfo rms              mass-produced computing equipment 

(workstations, supercomputers, etc.)     and equipment for state use 

1. High level of professional use in     1. Automation of routine tasks, 

information science (CAD, CASE, etc.)    office work, 
and 

in other areas                           household equipment, etc. 

2. Higher specialized education          2. Intermediate and preschool 
                                         education 

3. Flexible automated production robot   3. Automation of basic areas 


factories, numerical programmable        of industry energy, metallurgy, 

control, etc.                            machine building, etc. 

4. State control of high-level and       4. Systems at the administrative- 

financial-banking systems with all       regional level 
types 

of protectio n 

5. Special low-level systems with all    5. Special strategic systems 

types of protection 


  Consequently, the path of providing Ukraine with computing 
equipment in the next 3-5 years can be represented as follows: 
  a) fostering domestic development and production of defense 
equipment (all types) and civilian equipment intended to meet 
the needs for computer equipment in terms of mass 
informatization based on GOSVT-U, including: basic components 
of personal computers of low and intermediate performance 
levels, individual models of micro-computers and small 
computers, equipment for automated control and measurement 
systems and general-purpose computing equipment; a basic set of 
peripherals and media for them; PROM controllers, 
telecommunication equipment for collective use; computer and 
game computers, 
equipment for digital communication networks; consumer 
micro-electronics; services for the use and repair of the 
entire assortment of computing equipment (domestic and import); 
  b) creation of joint ventures with advanced firms in the CIS 
and the West in the production of computing equipment needed 
for promising areas of informatization, including 
general-purpose supercomputers, personal computers and 
workstations, central communication network equipment, and 
software for it; production of basic components for this 
equipment with subsequent ``Ukrainization'' of the production 
of these parts due to accelerated development of analogous 
domestic production; 
  c) purchase of computing equipment for a single use: unique 
supercomputers and peripherals, licenses for the use of the 
necessary software, and high- performance micro-processors and 
their frameworks; 
  d) provision of preferential conditions for conducting 
fundamental and applied research and scientific research and 
design work to create promising original computing equipment 
with no foreign analogs, as well as competitive types of 
computing equipment for which research and development is 
ongoing abroad. 
  5. Mechanisms to implement computing equipment development 
programs in Ukraine should take the following basic measures: 

  -  restructuring of scientific and industrial potential and 
the state system of control of these facilities to create a 
single computing equipment production complex; 
  -  creation, based on state and commercial enterprises and 
organizations in Ukraine, of a number of corporations 
(concerns, associat ions, technopolises, or other progressive 
organizational forms), which unite the producers and developers 
of computing equipment and all technological gamut from 
scientific research to the production of computing equipment 
and the elemental base, technological equipment, services, etc.; 
  -  provision of financing of the development of GOSVT-U from the 
state budget, extensive bank credit, customer funds, the budgets 
of local and regional agencies, etc.; 
  -  development of primary standards documents in the Supreme 
Council and Council of Ministers of Ukraine needed for the 
development of domestic computing equi pment, including 
standards to regulate the import of computing equipment and 
advanced technologies, guarantees of foreign investments, and 
investors' rights; 
  -  creation of joint ventures (primarily for components and 
materials) with near and distant foreign countries; 
  -  creation of a network of support centers for scientific 
technologies; 
  -  advanced development of th e elemental base of computing 
equipment (microelectronics, electronic radio components, 
instrument electromechanics, information media, etc.); purchase 
of licenses for products which define the technical level of 
computing equipment (microprocessors, memory, cathode ray 
tubes, lasers, hard disks, etc.); 
  -  organization of a network of certification centers for 
computing equipment; 
  -  creation of service systems for computer equipment; 
  -  creation of a software industry; 
  -  unification of programs for the development of military and 
civilian computing equipment in order to efficiently use 
scientific and technical and industrial potential. 

    6. Further details on the technical policy and development 
of the Concepts of the Development of Computing Equipment 
require advanced development of the Concepts of the 
Informatization of Ukrainian Society, especially in the area of 
determining the assortment of priority information technologies 
and systems needed, including the basic requirements on the 
specifications of hardware and software.

  [Abstract] This article examines three possible approaches 
to the suppression of speckle noise in radar images: incoherent 
integration, nonlinear image filtering, and homomorphic 
processing. Merely increasing the number of uncorrelated 
measurements, the first method, is a radical method. At least 
four-to five-fold incoherent integration is necessary for 
satisfactory perception of a radar image. The other two methods 
may be used successfully only for certain types of radar ima ge 
processing. Three types of smoothing by filtering are examined. 
The filtering methods are intended to suppress the large 
scatters characteristic of high resolution radar image speckle 
noise. A table contrasts the results obtained using various 
filtering methods on an image of the surface of Venus. Nonlinear 
filtering reduces the level of speckle noise, and image 
distortions have a noise-like character. Homomorphic processisng 
also reduces the level of speckle noise, but the image is 
distorted by smoothing. Figures 7; table 1; references 5: 1

  [Abstract] Algorithms for preliminary image processing 
(smoothing and contouring) are studied. Contouring is based on 
spatial differentiation, and various spatial differentiation 
algorithms are compared. An approach to paralleling the 
algorithms is proposed, and implementation of the resultant 
parallel algorithms on a computing system with a MIKROS 
programmable structure is studied. The MIKROS architecture is 
described. The programs were written in Fortran-S. Subroutines 
in the programs are described. The efficiency of execution is 
evaluated. Analysis of processing effic iency indicated a 
speed-up of a factor of 2-3. Figures 5; references 11 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Usually, contours are obtained by photometric 
evaluation, differentiation of the initial image, threshold 
processing, and contour refinement operations with removal of 
discontinuities. This article describes an algorithm to 
automatically trace contours directly from a differentiated 
image. This algorithm was developed to obtain information on the 
dimensions of spheroidal objects from half-tone images. A test 
image is proposed to study this algorithm. An example of contour 
tracing of an object on an X-ray image is presented. The 
differentiation process is described. Contour tracing begins 
with the operator indicating a contour point or a point in 
direct proximity to a contour. Subsequent points are found 
automatically as the algorithm analyzes the vicinity around the 
point. Backtracking along the contour is eliminated. The radius 
of examination can be tuned. The least squares method is used to 
check how closely the algorithm has succeeded in tracing the 
contour. It is found that the algorithm may be used for 
relatively simple X-ray images. The lines of tracks and 
oscillograms can be traced directly from the initial images.

  [Text] What do we mean by ``good memory''? Usually we mean 
reliability, then capacity, and finally the speed at which we 
can extract the required information. It's the same for human 
and machine memory. 
  People have long used external information carriers to 
expand 
their memory. At one time people used a string tied around the 
finger, later any type of note book. The same thing has happened 
with computers: the volume of their memory has been increased by 
using external carriers. First, they were mechanical (punched 
cards and paper tape), later, magnetic tapes and disks, and most 
recently, optical disks. The latter are favorably distinguished 
from the others by their basic parameters. However, they are 
produced by only a few Japanese and American firms and are used 
on a very limited basis, mainly due to their high cost. 
  Specialists at the Institute for Problems in Recording 
Information of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences have created 
their own version of an optical information carrier. It is not a 
disk, but a glass cylinder with a recording layer on the 
internal surface. A light beam is used to create pits on it, 
each of which corresponds to a one in binary code. At the time 
of recording, to increase the density, the cylinder is immersed 
in a liquid medium. When the beam passes through the liquid it 
is not scattered. Normally the beam would be scatt ered due to 
the difference in the indices of refraction of the laser and 
air. In this case, the beam remains focused. The diameter of the 
pit does not exceed 0.6 microns. This new carrier has a record 
high recording density. Its other specifications ar e comparable 
with those of the optical disk, and it has the same serious 
chances for improvement. The cylindrical memory is suitable for 
many uses, and the information on it can be rewritten. Another 
advantage is its small size: the optical memory cylinder has the 
same dimensions as a fountain pen. As for its cost, its creators 
hope that it will cost significantly less than foreign optical 
disks.

introduction] 
  [Text]Scientific engineering aspects of development of the 
first military PRO [anti-missile defense] system in the capital 
are described. Results are submitted of solving problems of 
control of combat operations of the system of guiding 
antimissile missiles [AMM] toward targets and evaluation of 
firing effectiveness are discussed. There is a brief description 
of the qualities of solutions, which were obtained from the 
results of full-scale tests. 
  Introduction. Problems of control and 
effectiveness of PRO systems were further developed in 
connection with establishment of the PRO system in Moscow. It 
conformed to the increased requirements of the system due to 
refinement of an enemy's attack equipment. Development of this 
system and of its experimental firing range prototype (Aldan 
system) was ordered by decree of the USSR government in 1960, 
and subsequent updating of the system was done in accordance 
with decrees adopted in 1963, 1971 and 1975. By that time, the 
team of developers of of the PRO system left the KB-1 [design 
office] and formed the Vympel experimental design office 
enterprise, subsequently renamed the Research Institute of 
Radio-Instrument Building. The system was developed with the 
same cooperation as system A, under the supervision of general 
designer G. V. Kisunko, corresponding member of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, and at the updating stage, under the 
supervision of chief designer I. D. Omelchenko. 
  The chief complex of the system (incomplete complement of 
firing complexes) with the A-350Zh AMM was approved for 
experimental operation on the basis of the results of testing 
the first stage, and the updated system A-35M with A-350R AMM 
was received to arm the Soviet Army on the basis of the results 
of the second stage. 
  1. Composition and structure of system. At the 
first designing stage, the system was built on the same 
principles as experimental system A. A range finder method was 
used to determine the coordinates of ballistic targets and AMM, 
that provided remote-controlled high guidance precision. In this 
regard, it was planned to use a relatively low-power nuclear 
warhead to destruct target heads. The purpose of the system was 
to intercept ballistic missiles equipped with solid heads 
(paired targets). 
  As established in the course of designing them, the 
feasibility of enhancing appreciably the destructive action of 
nuclear warheads, virtually without increasing their weight and 
dimensions and, consequently, without changing the appearance 
and characteristics of the designed A-350Zh AMM, made it 
possible to turn to a simple single-station method of 
determining target and AMM coordinates at the second stage of 
designing. This increased appreciably the channel features of 
the system with the same amount of information equipment, while 
the diminished guidance precision was compensated by the 
destructive action of the more powerful nuclear warhead. 
  The new PRO equipment that was developed and built conformed 
to the increased requirements of the zone of target interception 
according to its top and distant boundaries and higher 
characteristics of ballistic targets. The system included the 
following: main computer command center of the system consisting 
of the main command post and 5E92-B computer complex; radar 
center of early warning stations, Dunay-3; eight firing 
complexes each part of the command post of the complex, one 
radar for the target, two for AMM radar, two firing positions 
with ground-based launchers; A-350Zh AMM; system for 
transmitting data. 
  The developed system was subsequently updated and improved. 
  At the first stage of modernization, conditions for 
organizing interception of several ballistic missiles attaacking 
a defended object simultaneously by the AMM detail were 
substantially improved. 
  Development of strategic offense capabilities (development 
of 
separating warheads and equipment to overcome PRO) put a new 
task to PRO: to assure interception of complex ballistic 
targets. As a result, in 1975-1977 an updated system was 
developed aimed at assuring destruction of single complex 
ballistic targets, which consisted of a solid or separating 
warhead, and means of overcoming PRO. The task was accomplished 
mainly by combining with algorithms the channels for measuring 
target coordinates into a single information system and 
developing a new algorithm for centralized control of combat 
operations. Concurrently, there was expansion of the range of 
early warning by adding to the system two new radar stations for 
early warning of targets. 
  Subsequent refinement of the A-35M system was aimed at 
providing for interception of ballistic missiles attacking 
Moscow, in the broader sector of responsibility with use of 
radar plots from the SPRN [missile attack warning system], as 
well as interception of targets of the Pershing-2 type. 
  2. Control of system A-35 combat operations. A new 
technical problem that developers encountered was the problem of 
organizing the system's combat operations in the course of using 
AMM with special firing equipment to strike at several ballistic 
missiles in the case of a dense raid by a group of them. The 
consequences of a nuclear explosion could blind the radar 
resources on the one hand and, mutual destruction of AMM, on the 
other. The question arose of organizing ballistic missile 
strikes in such a way as to minimize the negative effect of 
nuclear explosions on operation of the system's equipment. This 
task was resolved by an algorithm for target distribution, as 
part of the general combat algorithm for centralized system 
control, which consisted of a set of problems of organizing 
combat operations of equipment and the system as a whole, aimed 
at achieving the highest effectiveness. 
  The main purpose of the algorithm for organization of combat 
operations was to assign firing channels for the targets with 
provisions of conditions for intercepting them, under which the 
probability of destructing each target earmarked for 
interception would be close to maximum. Provisions for organized 
interception of targets by means of orderly assignment of points 
of impact of AMM and targets also took into consideration the 
time of possible ``blinding'' of radar equipment. 
  An original method of interception was developed to organize 
interception of ``compact'' groups of ballistic missiles, which 
rendered the final stage of interception independent of 
ground-based equipment and thus more resistant to external 
interference from the nuclear explosion. 
  The task of organizing combat operations of the system, 
which 
is related to the need to search through a large number of 
combinations, was formalized as a mathematical programming 
problem, and it was solved in the system using the ``Hungarian 
method,'' so that it could conform to the available performance 
of computer resources of the main computer control center. 
  3. Anti-missile missile guidance system. The main 
requirement of the guidance system was precision, which was 
determined as a result of predesign integration of the obtained 
precision of radar measurement of target and AMM coordinates 
with dimensions of the strike region of nuclear warheads with 
the required high firing effectiveness. The other requirements 
of the guidance system were governed by the chief goal, and 
aimed at having it function normally in real combat use of 
firing complexes. The most important of these, which were new as 
compared to requirements imposed on system A, were: need to use 
AMM in the guidance system that had considerably greater strike 
distances and altitudes than the V-1000, including ranges beyond 
the atmosphere; the need for simultaneous guidance of a large 
number of AMM toward the firing units of complex ballistic 
targets with the time of impact with targets preset in the 
course of preparation of the firing cycle; feasibility of 
re-aiming the AMM while in flight. 
  The use of long-range AMM was motivated by the desire to 
move 
firing positions beyond the limits of a defended object of great 
length, and use of high strike altitudes is needed for the 
safety of the defended object against the harmful factors of 
explosions of the firing unit nuclear warheads of targets and 
our own AMM. A preset time of impact between the AMM and targets 
of a given raid is needed because of the above-mentioned method 
of intercepting compact ballistic missile groups, and it is 
required to assure stable interception. Feasibility of re-aiming 
the AMM in flight is necessary due to the dynamics of 
identifying firing units of ballistic missiles in the presence 
of false targets. 
  These requirements put basically new scientific-engineering 
tasks to the guidance system, which had no analogs in previously 
developed systems for control of different classes of 
interceptors -- use in the guidance system of the principle of 
jet control of AMM and development of a means of controlling its 
longitudinal movement. 
  Use of firing equipment in this system that was considerably 
more effective than in system A made it possible to obtain 
contact of AMM with targets on a head-on or intersecting course 
and thereby have a rather large interception zone. Under such 
conditions, it became desirable to guide the AMM toward a 
predicted point of impact, calculated on the basis of predicted 
trajectories of the target and AMM. It first became possible to 
apply this method because of existence of a control computer in 
the ground-based part of the guidance system. A ballistic 
trajectory, being energetically the most advantageous, was 
chosen as the kinematic AMM trajectory traversing the predicted 
point of impact. 
  Processing of current data about the target and AMM was 
carried out on the basis of Kalman's filtration theory. 
Forecasting the trajectory of a ballistic target was made as it 
was in system A. To estimate parameters of AMM motion a new 
method was developed, which is based on including in the 
guidance algorithm of a model of controlled AMM motion that 
responds to the same control commands as an actual AMM. The 
information obtained with the model about the regular (expected) 
motion of AMM, in particular about the vector of its 
acceleration, was taken into consideration along with 
information about its true (observed) motion. This permitted 
data processing with a lower-order filter and thereby reducing 
the filtration error component due to fluctuations of the signal 
at the filter input. 
  The wide range of parameters of target trajectories as 
related to the AMM launch point, with the long range of its 
flight and the chosen guidance method increased appreciably the 
range of AMM approach aspects to the target, as compared to the 
range of system A. Under such conditions, in developing 
principles for AMM control, it became desirable to reject the 
use of a fixed plane of AMM roll stabilization, as well as 
control on the principle of plane turns. Instead, a new 
three-command method of AMM control was developed, that 
permitted orientation of the vector of control acceleration in 
any direction, i.e., a complete sphere. Joint work with the 
staff of the KB-1 SKB-36 [special design office] (now called the 
Almaz Central Design Office) resulted in development of 
principles for forming the AMM stabilization circuit and choice 
of autopilot structure and parameters consistent with this 
method of control. Since this control method was based on 
controlling the AMM in relation to three (rather than two, as it 
was in conventional GAAM [guided antiaircraft missiles] linked 
axes, a master gyroscope was chosen as the main sensitive unit 
in the AMM. The angles measured by this gyroscope were used at 
the first autonomous stage of flight and during flight of the 
second stage AMM in rarefied layers of the atmosphere in order 
to monitor responses to control commands. In addition, these 
data from the master gyroscope were used throughout the flight 
of the AMM to control its angle of roll. Linear acceleration 
sensors were used as sensitive elements to control response to 
AMM control commands during flight in dense layers of the 
atmosphere. To reduce AMM oscillation about the center of 
gravity, feedback was used, as it is ordinarily, in the circuit 
for AMM stabilization upon signals of damping gyroscopes. An 
algorithm for generation of control commands programmed into the 
computer of the main computer control center, which conformed to 
the three-command control method and chosen autopilot system, 
was obtained on the basis of methods developed in optimum 
control theory and refined on technological and complex 
mathematical models. 
  In order to execute the concept of interception adopted and 
described above, it was necessary to solve a problem that was 
new for this class of systems: assure arrival of the AMM to the 
point of impact with the target within the time set in a given 
firing cycle, which led to development of a special circuit to 
regulate thrust of the second stage AMM engine. Since thrust at 
the boost and throttling stages could not be changed by design 
in the A-350Zh AMM, it was the moments of change from these 
engine modes that were regulated. The method and corresponding 
algorithm to control longitudinal AMM movement were based on 
juxtaposition of the estimated predicted path that could be 
traveled by an AMM with this profile of engine thrust in the 
time remaining before impact, to the nominal path which is the 
distance between the AMM and estimated point of impact with the 
target. In the event of discrepancy between these parameters, 
the previously estimated times of switching engine running modes 
were corrected in the required direction. The choice of 
parameters of this algorithm, which was programmed in the 
computer of the main computer control center, was made 
analytically with subsequent refinement on a mathemtical model 
of the system of AMM guidance. Altogether, the different 
algorithms, the principles of design of which have been 
discussed above, were mutually integrated with the special 
control algorithm and made up the general combat algorithm for 
AMM control, which is one of the most important and large parts 
of the general combat algorithm of the system. 
  There was further development of ideas and principles, which 
had been advanced and applied in developing the guidance system 
for V-1000 AMM in system A, in the course of refinement and 
testing of the guidance system (as the aggregate of information 
resources, general combat algorithm of AMM control programmed in 
the computer of the main computer control center, and the 
anti-missile missile that carried radio equipment and an 
autopilot). The chief one was the use of a real-time 
mathematical model, which was executed on standard computers in 
the system of the main computer control center, as the principal 
tool for refining the guidance system. A set of software of 
system equipment simulators and characteristics of the ballistic 
target were used on one of the computers and the programmed 
algorithm for AMM control on another, in the standard execution. 
At a certain stage of system refinement, registration documents 
were prepared for the equipment simulators on the basis of 
results of full-scale testing of this equipment. Development of 
this model made it possible to use the experimental-theoretical 
method extensively in assessing the characteristics obtained in 
the AMM guidance system. 
  Full-scale testing of the guidance system with AMM launches 
was carried out on the Aldan system firing range complex 
organized in the same place as the system A experimental 
complex. It was carried out in two stages: up to 1971 with the 
A-350Zh AMM, and after 1971 with the A-350Zh and 
A350R[.sup]2[/]. The methodology of full-scale guidance 
system tests was essentially the same as in testing guidance 
systems of the V-1000 AMM: testing conditions were increasingly 
complicated in stages: from launches of AMM in an open circuit 
by stepped control commands to launches of AMM in a closed 
circuit with real ballistic targets. At the final stage of 
system testing in 1976-1977, there were 7 AMM launches (2 of 
which were A-350R) with reference targets of the 8K63 and 8K65 
types, including some with false targets, as well as 3 A-350Zh 
AMM launches with real type 8K63 ballistic targets. 
  The results of trials of the A-35 system revealed that the 
AMM guidance system met the imposed requirements and specified 
operating conditions. 
  4. Firing equipment of AMM, control of its use, 
assessment of AMM firing effectiveness. All three problems 
mentioned in this heading were solved of necessity concurrently 
and in close relationship to problems of control of AMM and the 
system as a whole. However, in the course of development, it was 
necessary to solve some problems in the first approximation, 
rather than in full, with consideration of their link, as is the 
case when developing real systems that are complex. For the sake 
of convenience, we shall first discuss these problems separately 
in this article. 
  The choice of type of firing equipment to arm AMM in the 
A-35 
system was determined by the results of firing in the A system, 
which revealed that firing had relatively low effectiveness and 
the effects of fragmentation striking elements on the warheads 
of the AMM were ambiguous. To defend Moscow it was necessary to 
obtain warhead damage that would virtually preclude the standard 
action of a nuclear charge in the warhead, as well as premature 
action of the nuclear charge caused by AMM firing equipment over 
the entire zone of its use. The latter was needed to minimize 
the effects of nuclear explosions on system elements and the 
environment. Thus, even with the guidance precision that could 
be achieved by the three-range method, it was necessary to use a 
nuclear warhead on the AMM. This became doubly necessary with 
the change from the three-range method to the usual one for 
measurement of coordinates with radar (two angles and range). 
Use of nuclear warheads was also desirable because the 
effectiveness of modern nuclear warheads depends substantially 
less on their weight than does the effectiveness of 
fragmentation warheads, so that it was possible, as noted in 
Section 1, to leave the AMM payload virtually unchanged with 
change in precision of its guidance and detonation. Plans were 
made for full-scale experiments and for several years they were 
carried out, enabling us to obtain rather reliable data on 
effects of nuclear explosions on the AMM warheads, AMM and its 
instruments, on ground-based PRO equipment, on the environment, 
including space and the top layers of the atmosphere. It was 
found necessary to take these physical phenomena into 
consideration in designing equipment and the PRO system as a 
whole, and in a number of instances substantial additional work 
was required (see sections 1-3). 
  Of course, substantially new approaches were also needed to 
the choice of judicious characteristics for the firing 
equipment, methods of controlling it and assessment of firing 
effectiveness. The first steps were developed of a new 
methodology for optimization of AMM firing equipment, which 
differed considerably from approaches inherent in the choice of 
ordinary firing equipment of GAAM. At this stage, in-depth work 
was done on different problems, and full synthesis of methods 
was achieved only with the design of the second generation PRO 
system of Moscow. We should include, among these important 
methodological problems, development of methods of assessing 
firing effectiveness of AMM with nuclear warheads targeting the 
warheads of ballistic missiles. Use was made of data from the 
above-mentioned experiments and more detailed studies of the 
physics of nuclear explosions on ballistic missile warheads, 
with consideration of the complex effect of nuclear explosions 
on warheads and design features of nuclear warheads, AMM and 
warheads, which required close interaction among developers of 
the different items and theoretical physicists. The results of 
their work were formalized in relevant manuals and 
methodological publications approved by supervisors of the work 
in different agencies, including the customer. The results of 
the physical studies and their processing made it possible to 
obtain ``laws of target strike.'' At that time, coordinate 
target strike laws were used, i.e., probability of target strike 
as a function of coordinates of point of AMM explosion relative 
to the target. These coordinate laws were arbitrary, i.e., they 
depended on impact conditions such as altitude of strike, angles 
of attack of AMM and warheads. Since the complete probability of 
striking the target W was described by a 
multidimensional integral, it was impossible to calculate it 
under real conditions. Analytical methods were developed to 
calculate W for a number of simplified cases; 
however, statistical simulation modeling on a computer turned 
out to be the most accurate and convenient method. The results 
of calculating W were used at the first stage of 
designing the system in order to coordinate the characteristics 
of the destructive effect of possible variants of nuclear 
warheads of AMM with the requirements of precision of guidance 
system and AMM detonation. In developing algorithms for 
organizing combat operations, the results of more accurate 
design estimates of W, calculations of W 
were used to select optimum conditions for AMM impact with 
targets. Finally, calculations of W were used to 
carry out State testing of the system to assess overall 
effectiveness on complex system models. 
  The results of developing methods of calculating W 
were generalized in research carried out by several civil and 
military institutes under the supervision of one of these 
authors. 
  The method of command control of detonation, which was 
proposed and developed for system A, had to be enlarged and 
elaborated for system A-35. In the first place, in a combat 
system the conditions of AMM and target impact expanded 
considerably, and or this reason it was necessary to develop a 
universal method of optimum precision to detonate nuclear 
warheads of anti-missile missiles. In addition to conditions of 
impact in the case of a particular launch, this method also took 
into consideration statistical characteristics of processed 
coordinates of the target and AMM (different processing 
algorithms were used in the channels for AMM guidance and 
nuclear warhead detonation), presence of dynamic AMM guidance 
errors and some other factors. With this method, determination 
was made of optimum detonation time for effective firing. In the 
second place, as noted above (see Section 2), for the first time 
in design practice and development of interceptor missiles, 
engine cutoff was used in the A-350R AMM in order to hold to the 
preset time of impact. In the third place, in determining the 
time of transmission of the ``main command'' with information 
about detonation of a nuclear warhead, consideration was given 
to the special importance of this command, and it was relayed by 
algorithm in the intervals without noise related to nuclear 
explosions of AMM in both the environment and in the AMM BRA 
[expansion unknown]. For this purpose, predicted times of impact 
of all AMM with targets (i.e., estimated times of nuclear 
explosion of AMM) were input in the detonation algorithm of a 
given firing complex. Thus, it was necessary to use data on the 
level of the entire system for algorithmic protection of the 
channel for AMM detonation. All of the described problems tasks 
were performed by a combination of the algorithm for detonation 
of SBCh [expansion unknown, could be typo for nuclear warhead] 
with the algorithm for generating the command to cut off the 
power plant of the AMM. The combined programmed algorithm was 
checked on the firing complexes of the main computer control 
center system. The entire system of detonation of nuclear 
warheads and power plant cut-off was tested on the range in 
actual launches. 
  System trials revealed the high effectiveness and 
reliability 
of command detonation of nuclear warheads under conditions of 
actions simulated with algorithms of multiple nuclear explosions 
of AMM. 
  5. Designs for Taran and Avrora PRO systems. These 
systems have not been built, so that we shall mention here only 
the basic distinctive features in their design. At the first 
stage of development of system A-35 (in 1963), the well-known 
ballistic missile designer, Academician V. N. Chelomey suggested 
that the UR-100 ballistic missile be used for PRO purposes. It 
was proposed to launch the UR-100 toward points of impact with 
an enemy's ballistic missile far from the defended territory and 
to destruct them by nuclear explosions of the warheads of 
UR-100, in response to reports from the missile attack warning 
system. N. S. Khrushchev liked this idea very much because in 
building up the arsenal of ballistic missiles we were also 
developing PRO. The inconsistency of this idea was apparent to 
specialists in PRO and missile attack warning systems who 
participated in its discussion; however, development of the 
Taran system, as V. N. Chelomey called it, stopped only after N. 
S. Khrushchev's retirement. 
  At approximately the same time, the design for the 
territorial Aurora system was being developed under the 
supervision of G. V. Kisunko. The design proposed several 
interesting solutions concerning radar (radar stations with 
phased array), rockets (A-351 AMM with a wide range of combat 
altitudes, A-900 long-range antimissile missile), variable power 
nuclear warheads for different combat altitudes, and others. 
However, the main flaw of this design was that it did not take 
into full consideration all the problems arising at a PRO if an 
enemy would use modern equipment to overcome PRO. For this 
reason, the commission that reviewed the preliminary design of 
the Avrora project did not recommend continued development of 
its experimental design.

  [Text]This article deals with the scientific engineering 
aspects of development of the first experimental PRO 
[antimissile defense] system (1953-1962) in our country. It 
discusses methods, means and results of solving problems of 
controlling antimissile missiles, providing for firing 
effectiveness required for the experimental complex, and 
appropriate precision of antimissile missile guidance. The main 
data are submitted on full-scale tests of system A, including 
the world's first interception and destruction of the head of an 
R-12 ballistic missile fired on 4 March 1961. 
  Introduction. This article is apparently the first 
publication in the open press concerning scientific-engineering 
(cybernetic) aspects of development of real PRO systems already 
developed and being developed in our country. We consider this 
publication to be quite relevant and timely, because it is 
expressly in our country that the world's first experimental PRO 
complex (system A) was developed and, at the present time, only 
Russia has a functional PRO firing system. We believe that a 
rather open discussion of these matters is particularly timely 
at the present time, when negotiations are in progress, in 
accordance with the agreement made in June 1992 between the 
United States and Russia, in order to ``develop jointly with 
allies and other concerned states of the concept of global 
defense against a limited ballistic missile 
attack.''[.sup]1[/] 
  Having worked on the PRO since the early 1950s, these 
authors 
intend to describe in this article and its continuation the main 
results of scientific-engineering developments in the PRO field 
(from 1953 to the present time), as well as to express our views 
on future development of PRO systems. 
  Beginning with this article, we intend to discuss the above 
issues in the following order: 
  1. Experimental PRO firing range (system A). 
  2. PRO system of Moscow (system A-35). Planning the Taran 
border PRO system and territorial Aurora [``Avrora''] PRO system. 
  3. Development of Moscow PRO system. Further refinement of 
PRO system. 
  The history of PRO development in our country and the PRO 
problem at the present time have many other aspects: political, 
and both domestic and international military ones. This history 
is steeped in dramatic events, creative achievements and 
disappointments, spurts of activity and prolonged slacks. Such 
political and military figures as Khrushchev, Ustinov and 
Gorbachev, prominent scientists and designers had a bearing on 
the PRO problem and participated actively in it. If this broader 
discussion of the PRO problem finds readers, we are prepared to 
share with them our recollections and views on this problem, 
which is not simple. 
  1. First stage of research in the PRO field. Search for 
a means of damaging the warheads of ballistic missiles. In 
late December 1953, research on the problem of developing the 
means and system for anti-missile defense (PRO) began at KB-1 
[design office] where we worked. The work was carried out 
concurrently in several departments. Systemic questions, 
distinctions of systems for control of AMM [antimissile 
missiles] and questions of efficacy of AMM firing on ballistic 
missile warheads were explored mainly in the laboratory headed 
by Professor N. A. Livshits. The laboratory consisted of several 
groups, including the firing effectiveness group. Academician V. 
S. Pugachev, who was a professor at the Zhukovskiy Academy 
[Military Air Engineering Academy imeni N. Ye. Zhukovskiy] at 
that time, was scientific chief of this group. The task for the 
group was to select a plan and optimize the specifications for 
firing equipment of GAAM [guided anti-aircraft missiles], i.e., 
their warheads and electronic fuzes. Development of 
fragmentation warheads and electronic fuzes was carried out in 
specialized organizations. 
  The task of selecting and optimizing firing equipment for 
guided anti-aircraft missiles was carried out in accordance with 
the general guidelines and methods of assessing effectiveness of 
a firing system proposed in 1945 by Academician A. N. 
Kolmogorov. At that time, these guidelines and methods were 
developed at the Zhukovskiy Academy (by V. S. Pugachev, Ye. S. 
Venttsel and others), as well as several other research 
institutes of the defense industry and military institutes. 
Later on, after publication in our country of the book by P. 
Morse and G. Kimball, ``Methods of Operations Research,'' in 
1956, we learned (like a Moliere character) that in working on 
the choice and optimization of firing equipment we were engaged 
in studies of operations. At that time, assessment of firing 
effectiveness[.sup]2[/] at KB-1 was made by the optical 
modeling method, which was used at the Zhukovskiy Academy. 
Theoretical estimation methods were combined effectively with 
missions to testing ranges for warheads and electronic fuzes, as 
well as the State Central Testing Range (GTsP) not far from 
Kapustin Yar. There, group members were included in commissions 
for evaluation of effectiveness of firing of live GAAM at target 
aircraft (Tu-4, Il-28, MIG). 
  It became apparent very soon to the members of the firing 
effectiveness group that the firing equipment for AMM designed 
to destruct warheads of ballistic missiles must be very 
different from the warheads of GAAM that had already become 
standard (high-speed fragmentation warhead with a circular 
strike field [``field of destruction''], and electronic fuze 
with a directional radiation pattern and a radius of action 
within the maximum range of GAAM misses). A positive solution to 
the problem of damaging warheads was suggested to us in the 
reports of our precursors who studied the PRO problem, the 
groups of Mozharovskiy (Research Institute 4, Ministry of 
Defense) and Khlebtsevich (Research Institute 885). In their 
work, which was carried out in 1948-1951, plans were proposed 
for arming AMM with two types of guidance systems. For remote 
control AMM, fragmentation warheads were proposed with slow 
fragments and circular (disk) strike field. The optimum radius 
R[.sub]o[/] and form of strike field were 
determined according to a number of factors, and it could change 
with each firing. It was proposed to detonate the fragmentation 
warheads with an advance, which is required to have a radius of 
R[.sub]o[/] between the target and the strike 
field at the moment of contact. However, the method of such 
detonation and effect of its precision on firing effectiveness 
was left virtually unconsidered. For AMM with a homing device, 
it was suggested to use fragmentation warheads with a guidance 
system that would turn in the direction of the target and 
explode upon receiving information from the homing 
head.[.sup]3[/] 
  Since it was planned to use remote controlled AMM in the 
work 
on PRO carried out at KB-1, attention was focused mainly on 
implementation and optimization of the first system for arming 
the AMM. The first results of evaluation of precision of AMM 
guidance and effectiveness of firing at ballistic missile 
warheads were obtained at KB-1 in August 1954. A method was 
proposed for controlled detonation of AMM fragmentation warheads 
on the basis of data from the same ground-based information 
resources used to guide the AMM. It was proposed that the 
command for detonation be transmitted over the same line of 
command over which commands for AMM were transmitted, but with 
much less timing discreteness. 
  It must be stated that both systems for arming AMM to 
destruct the warheads of ballistic missiles were subsequently 
proposed repeatedly and used in AMM, and have survived to this 
day in a modified form. A method was developed to evaluate 
target W in order to assess the influence of 
detonation precision on probability of damaging W, 
and a large volume of calculations was carried out.[.sup]4[/] 
Calculations revealed that detonation precision had little 
effect on W, which made it possible to adopt and 
subsequently use this rather simple and reliable method of 
controlled detonation of fragmentation warheads (later on of 
nuclear warheads also) in PRO systems. 
  However, with the calculated precision of AMM guidance, 
firing effectiveness was low, although it was close to the usual 
level for antiaircraft systems. At that time, no one imposed 
requirements on W, but the consequences of missing 
even one ballistic missile with a nuclear charge over Moscow 
were apparent to us. 
  In late 1954, Professor G. V. Kisunko (corresponding member 
of the Russian Academy of Sciences from 1958 on), who headed one 
of the largest KB-1 subdivisions, began to play a leading role 
in research on PRO at the KB-1. He requested an evaluation of 
firing effectiveness of several AMM. Estimates revealed that, 
with the guidance precision determined for AMM, in the opinion 
of G. V. Kisunko effectiveness was acceptable only with the use 
of 8-10 such missiles, and this was unrealistic for the PRO 
system. It may be that expressly this estimates compelled G. V. 
Kisunko to search for a new method, not used for GAAM, for 
determination of target coordinates, and an AMM that would 
permit radical improvement of precision of AMM guidance. Such a 
method was soon found. This change in content and 
characteristics of information resources of the PRO system 
indicates the relationship between firing equipment and general 
systems characteristics, i.e., the need for a systems approach. 
On the other hand, with such high requirements of firing 
effectiveness, it was necessary to have reliable data concerning 
vulnerability of ballistic missile warheads as related to 
fragmentation warheads. The most realistic way to obtain such 
data was to carry out experiments with ballistic missile 
warheads produced in our country. Without going into the details 
of this important question, the scientific problems of which is 
beyond the scope of this article, we believe it necessary to 
note that such experiments were organized in the next 2-3 years 
on the testing ranges near Moscow, and in 1956 in Arzamas-l6. 
The latter experiments were carried out with real R-5 ballistic 
missile warheads under the scientific supervision of Academician 
Yu. B. Khariton. R-5 ballistic missiles with warheads destructed 
by fragments were also launched. The results of these 
experiments revealed the limited capabilities of fragmentation 
warheads and gave impetus to investigation of use of nuclear 
warheads in PRO. 
  2. AMM guidance system and detonation of its 
warhead. The AMM guidance system aimed at a ballistic 
target refers to the aggregate of interacting firing elements, 
singled out on the principle of participation in AMM control in 
order to execute the military objective of interception. Thus, 
the guidance system is the aggregate of information resources 
controlling computers, earth-missile radio circuits and the 
object of control -- the AMM with its onboard equipment and 
ammunition, which is organized by means of the appropriate 
choice of parameters of these resources and software generated 
computer algorithms for AMM control in order to have it come in 
contact with the head of the ballistic target and then to 
destruct it. 
  Development of the AMM guidance system for ballistic 
targets, 
as an element of the PRO system, was a major new research 
problem. A decree of the USSR government in 1956 marked the 
start of solving this problem within the limits of specific 
research-experimental and experimental-design work. This decree 
called for establishment of our country's first experimental 
firing range complex of PRO equipment, the A system. 
  The design, development and testing of this complex were 
carried out in 1956-1962 under the scientific-engineering 
supervision of general designer G. V. Kisunko. 
  The complex consisted of the following main elements: 
early-warning radar for ballistic targets (Dunay-2); 3 precision 
guidance radars, each of which consisted of radar channels to 
measure target and AMM coordinates; radar station for AMM 
lift-off station for transmission of control commands to AMM; 
station for transmission of control commands to AMM; main 
computer control center consisting of a command post, and M-40 
control electronic digital computer; radio relay circuits for 
communication between system objects. Interception of ballistic 
target heads at the complex was carried out with V-1000 AMM. 
  The early-warning radar detected ballistic targets at a 
distance of D = 1200 km, and in the course of 
automatic tracking it relayed plots to target channels of 
precision guidance radars. 
  The precision guidance radars, which are radar stations with 
parabolic steerable antennas [dishes], operating in the 
centimeter range of waves in a single-pulse mode, would pick up 
the ballistic missile head during automatic tracking at a 
distance of D = 700 km and the AMM (upon receipt of 
signal from onboard responder) by the time of the start of 
precision guidance. Measurement of distances to them was made 
with precision characterized by a mean-square error not 
exceeding _s_ = 5 m. 
  The AMM lift-off radar station with steerable parabolic 
antenna and a scanning beam picked up the AMM during automatic 
tracking immediately after lift-off. Determination was made of 
deviation of the AMM from the kinematic trajectory at the 
lift-off stage from the station's measurements of AMM 
coordinates and range, whereas at the guidance stage dynamic AMM 
instructions were formed for the precision guidance radars for 
angular tracking of AMM. 
  The station for transmission of control commands, whose 
parabolic antenna was rigidly attached to the antenna column of 
the radar station for AMM lift-off, relayed control and warhead 
detonation commands to the AMM. 
  All these elements of equipment, which were located at 
different points and at considerable distances from one another 
in the Betpak-Dala Desert, were interconnected by a highly 
informative radio relay system of communications and data 
transmission, which made it possible to control all elements of 
the experimental complex by means of the M-40 electronic digital 
computer with a computer control center in a single firing cycle. 
  In view of the speed of interception processes and 
impossibility of human intervention in these processes, as well 
as the high guidance precision required, the entire target 
interception process was automated for the first time with use 
of the M-40 computer, which is one of the first developments of 
the presently well-known Institute of Precise Mechanics and 
Computer Engineering, headed at that time by Academician S. A. 
Lebedev. The computer operated at a speed of 40,000 
single-address operations per second. 
  Development of the algorithm to control the system A 
experimental firing complex was carried out by the head 
institute under the supervision of G. V. Kisunko, whereas the 
Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering, which 
already had some highly professional programmers on its staff, 
took on the software task. 
  The V-1000, which was developed by OKB-2 [special design 
office] of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry under the 
supervision of P. D. Grushin, was notable for particular 
engineering innovativeness. This was a two-stage rocket with 
powerful solid-propellant booster and controllable second stage 
with a liquid-propellant engine. The mean velocity of the AMM, 
1000 m/s, was unprecedented for those years,and its 
controllability permitted interception of targets at altitudes 
of up to 25 km. The specifications for the guidance system 
stemmed from the purpose of the experimental testing range 
complex, its structure and features of its elements. Since its 
purpose was to prove experimentally and demonstrate that guided 
AMM can intercept a ballistic target and destruct its head by 
warhead fragments, the main prerequisite for the guidance system 
was utmost precision of guidance. At the firing range complex 
planning stage, the precision characteristics of coordinate 
information about the target and AMM obtained from radars and, 
accordingly, the characteristics of possible guidance precision 
were coordinated with parameters of AMM fragmentation warheads 
and, in particular, with the size of the damage to head sections 
caused by fragmentation warheads. 
  Since a fragmentation warhead was selected for a disk-shaped 
strike field with slow dispersion of destructive elements (of 
the Zavesa type), and also to enhance guidance precision and 
reduce the effect on it of errors in detonation of fragmentation 
warheads, an important specific requirement of the guidance 
system was to assure encounter of AMM with the target on 
collision courses, with close to zero angles of impact. 
  The short balance of time in the system of interception of 
ballistic targets because of their high velocity and, in 
particular, the short time available for precision guidance 
(t = 12-14 s) required high dynamic qualities of the 
guidance system and, in particular, determined the high 
requirements of precision and speed of the guidance system. 
  By the time system A began to be developed, systems with 
guided rockets, including those with GAAM, had already been 
developed and tested at KB-1. 
  The initial posits in planning the guidance system for the 
V-1000 AMM were largely determined by experience in developing 
guidance systems for anti-aircraft guided missiles. However, the 
specific operating conditions of the AMM guidance system and 
higher requirements for it, as mentioned above, made it 
necessary to develop substantially the traditional guidance 
system of GAAM. At the same time, use (for the first time in our 
country) of a digital computer to solve guidance problems 
provided the prerequisites for such development. Concurrently, 
an utterly new problem arose in the practice of planning 
guidance systems, that of developing computer algorithms, and 
two directions emerged that corresponded to theory of optimum 
systems: development of algorithms to process data about 
ballistic targets and AMM, and development of algorithms for 
actual control of AMM. 
  The problem of determination of coordinates of the target 
and 
interceptor with precision sufficient for use of fragmentation 
charges with the acceptable weight and dimensions, was one of 
the most serious problems. Considering the fact that error in 
radar measurement of angular coordinates is the main 
contributing factor to error of determination of object 
coordinates, G. V. Kisunko proposed use of a method based on 
using measurements of range from three points geographically 
distant from one another (the three-distance method), thus 
obtaining rather high precision in measurement of target and AMM 
coordinates in the areas of hypothetical location of the points 
of impact between the AMM and target, thanks to the high 
precision of range measurement. 
  Some original formulas were obtained demonstrating the 
direct 
correlation between all three cartesian coordinates and 
distance, which made it possible to carry out an in-depth 
analysis of precision of the three-distance method and, in 
particular, determine which was the optimum location, in the 
sense of precision, of the three range finders. As a result, the 
radar stations were situated at the apices of an equilateral 
triangle, with 150-km sides 100 to 250 km away from the shore of 
Lake Balkhash, in the middle of the Betpak-Dala Desert. 
  The method of parallel approach of AMM to the target on 
head-on courses was selected as the guidance method, due to the 
substantially higher velocity of the target than the AMM, and it 
provided conditions for destructing the target with the disk 
field of warhead fragments. AMM lift-off in a trajectory set by 
this method was carried out in a regular curve, the parameters 
of which were determined by the projected trajectory of the 
target. 
  The rotating mechanism of the launcher turned the guides for 
azimuth and angle of the site. Such turns placed the missile, at 
the time of the launch, in a plane traversing the launcher and 
tangent to the ballistic missile target trajectory at the 
proposed point of impact between the rocket and the target. 
Thereafter, the entire trajectory remained in this plane in the 
process of lift-off. 
  Originally, in view of the considerable scatter of points at 
which the warheads of ballistic missiles R-5 and R-12 fell, as 
well as considering the relatively short range of V-1000 AMM 
travel, it was proposed to create two launching positions on the 
firing range and to prepare two AMM for simultaneous launches, 
and to set the proper deviation of the launching position from 
the results of existing deviation of the target trajectory. In 
view of the substantial increase in expenses to prepare and 
carry out experiments with such arrangement of the complex, a 
solution was found with respect to optimum AMM control at the 
lift-off stage with fixed boundary conditions, which made it 
possible to preclude the need to build one of the launching 
positions. 
  The choice of law for control, types of feedback in the 
autopilot and their parameters, method of limiting AMM overloads 
[or accelerations], was made on the basis of analysis of dynamic 
characteristics of homing with use of frequency methods and 
modeling. 
  As for methods of analysis and engineering synthesis of 
guidance systems used at that time, due credit must be given to 
the book ``Theory of Tracking Systems,'' edited by H. James, N. 
Nichols, and R. Phillips, which appeared in the USSR in the late 
1940s and was published in Russian in 1951. The frequency 
methods of calculating the parameters of tracking systems 
developed in this book were used in designing practice for a 
long time, and have not lost their significance to this day, in 
spite of the unquestionable effectiveness and popularity of 
modern methods of statistical theory of systems for control of 
states in space. 
  As a result, an original design of a guidance system was 
designed and executed, with one feedback in the AMM 
stabilization circuit responding to signals from the damping 
gyroscope, and a developed direct control circuit, in which 
problems of formation of the law of control, stabilization of 
coefficient of amplification of the control circuit, limiting 
AMM overloads, input of the necessary differentiating effect 
(phase advance) to provide for stability of a second-order 
astatic system were solved with algorithms. All these algorithms 
were programmed in the M-40 control computer. 
  This design of the guidance system design made it possible 
to 
avoid many of the flaws inherent in the traditional design for 
GAAM control, where several of the above problems were solved 
using resources in the missile. 
  The appearance of computers in the guidance system, as a 
dynamic element in the AMM control circuit, put a new task to 
developers: analysis of the effect of computers on dynamics of 
guidance systems. This was solved analytically using the 
frequency method. The obtained formulas for transfer functions 
corresponding to linear algorithms for processing information 
about the target and AMM, and algorithms for AMM control made it 
possible to analyze the dynamics of the guidance system with 
consideration of computers, and to obtain a number of important 
recommendations on choice of guidance system parameters. 
  Refinement of the guidance system of V-1000 AMM was carried 
out by modeling processes of guiding AMM to a target. This was 
done in two stages: first, a technological model executed with 
an analog machine and later on a complex digital-analog 
simulation stand. Studies of different aspects of guidance 
system dynamics with actual control equipment were carried out 
on dynamic stands of Research Institute 2 of the Ministry of the 
Aviation Industry (now called GosNIIAS [expansion unknown]), 
with the participation of the staff of this institute. 
  Modeling on the analog part of the complex stand produced 
simulators of the main elements of the system (lift-off and 
guidance radars, station for command transmission, earth-missile 
radio links) and an anti-missile missile with onboard radio 
equipment and autopilot, and on the digital part of the standard 
M-40 computer, programmed firing guidance system algorithms. 
Such a stand was developed for the first time in the practice of 
designing and refining guidance systems of guided rockets. 
  Subsequently, development of complex simulation stands of 
this type, with execution of a firing program and simulated 
environment on a standard computer of the firing complex gained 
a firm place in refinement of GAAM and AMM, and gave an 
additional impetus to development of experimental theoretical 
methodology for testing rocket armament systems. 
  Simulation on the complex stand made it possible to check 
the 
validity of chosen guidelines for designing the guidance system, 
define the parameters of its main elements, and assess the 
dynamic characteristics of the guidance system, including 
precision of guiding AMM toward a target. 
  In order to carry out full-scale tests of the guidance 
system 
for the V-1000 AMM, which was done on the newly built testing 
range in Sary-Shagan, a new technology was developed in the 
range complex of system A devices, that conformed to the very 
complicated nature of this complex. In particular, in addition 
to traditional independent launches of GAAM upon command 
programmed on the missile and launches in a closed control 
circuit and open control circuit upon stepped commands from the 
computer, relayed to the missile over a radio link, launches of 
AMM in a closed control circuit according to preset, fixed 
lift-off and guidance trajectories, model launches of an AMM 
simulator programmed on a standard computer toward an actual 
target in the firing cycle of the complex. 
  Input of new intermediate stages in the full-scale tests 
made 
it possible to apply to a greater extent of the principle of 
going from the simple to the complicated, which is inherent in 
the most effective methodology for refining complex engineering 
systems. As a result, it was possible within a rather short time 
to refine on the range the guidance system and firing complex as 
a whole, in spite of their great complexity. Such methodology 
for full-scale tests found broad application as well in testing 
next generation guidance systems. 
  The guidance system characteristics obtained in planning and 
refining the complex provided for interception of the heads of 
ballistic targets with sufficient precision for testing purposes. 
  Concurrently with development of the guidance system, work 
was done to produce a new type of firing equipment. Considering 
the experimental data obtained on the effect of fragments on 
warheads of ballistic missiles, the technical assignment was 
made to develop a fragmentation warhead for the V-1000 AMM. The 
method of detonation upon command was executed in the complex of 
an algorithm and equipment to put out commands for activating 
and detonating fragmentation warheads. The same equipment of 
system A used in the guidance system was used here. In 
developing the algorithm for activation, the main task was to 
determine precisely the moment of encounter of the target with 
the strike field of the fragmentation warhead of an activated 
AMM. The radius of the strike field was determined on the basis 
of obtaining maximum probability of destructing a warhead in a 
given launch. Since the activation and detonation commands for 
the fragmentation warhead were irreversible, special attention 
was given to protecting the detonation channel against 
malfunctions in the program and equipment involved in this task. 
  We must mention that much attention was devoted to recording 
and processing data obtained when refining programs in all types 
of work, including firing launches. Study of this information 
made it possible not only to find errors in algorithms and 
programs, but also to find ways to enhance firing effectiveness. 
Thus, it was noted that guidance of AMM toward a target and 
impact with the target usually occurred with noticeable dynamic 
guidance errors. In addition to steps to improve the guidance 
system, it was proposed to determine the optimum radius of the 
strike field, not only on the basis of a priori data 
(statistical characteristics of guidance errors), but also with 
consideration of dynamic errors h[.sub]dyn[/] 
occurring and extending to the point of impact between the AMM 
and target. Use of these elements of adaptation in the 
detonation channel made it possible, on the average, to improve 
firing effectiveness appreciably. This suggestion was followed 
by the time of the first firing launch. 
  3. Results of full-scale tests. Firing 
effectiveness. The first firing launch of an AMM armed with 
a fragmentation warhead took place on 24 November 1960. 
  The AMM was armed with a fragmentation warhead designed by 
A. 
V. Voronov. In this launch, the warhead of an R-5 ballistic 
missile was not damaged. The guidance error was too close to the 
established strike radius R[.sub]o[/], and for 
this reason 2-3 months were spent working on improving guidance 
precision. On the other hand, it was decided to use in the 
future a new fragmentation warhead designed by K. I. Kozorezov. 
It differed from the first type of fragmentation warhead in that 
it had a different type of destruct element. 
  On 4 March 1961, for the first time in the world system A 
intercepted and destructed the warhead of an R-12 ballistic 
missile flying at a speed of more than 3 km/s. 
  The fact that destruction occurred was recorded by equipment 
on the firing range for external trajectory measurements. 
Examination of warhead fragments scattered beyond the normal 
zone for falling warheads confirmed visual observations, 
according to which warhead destruction occurred at an altitude 
of about 10 km. 
  Subsequently, V-1000 AMM were launched that were aimed at 
R-5 
and R-12 ballistic missile warheads with a more developed system 
of recording damage to warheads, including damage to the warhead 
charge proper. 
  Direct damage to ballistic missile warheads was recorded in 
two AMM launches aimed at R-5 and three aimed at R-12 ballistic 
missiles. 
  Frequency of strikes obtained in all launches was close to a 
priori estimates. 
  To further enhance precision and effectiveness of firing, a 
modification was made in the V-1000 with a heat homer. For this 
AMM variant, an arming system was developed which included a 
guided fragmentation warhead with directional action and an 
original warhead control system, i.e., turning, change in 
response to misses in width of strike field sector and 
detonation time. The control system was installed in the 
missile computer operating on information from TGS [telegraph 
stations?] and from earth over the detonation channel. Several 
such AMM were built; however, trials were unfortunately not 
completed for nontechnical reasons. 
  On the whole, the full-scale tests of system A revealed that 
it is possible in principle to intercept and destruct rather 
effectively the heads of ballistic missiles. 
  Interception and destruction of ballistic targets not only 
was very important from the military engineering point of view, 
but also had political significance, since even a single 
ballistic target was considered an absolute weapon at that time. 
However, the event did not elicit an appropriate reaction in the 
country. There were sufficient reasons for this. In part, it 
happened because work on PRO in those years was very classified, 
partly because the administrative circles of the military 
industrial complex were concerned with preparations for the 
first launch of a manned earth satellite in orbit, which 
happened on 12 April 1961, leaving the outstanding event in the 
history of PRO in the sidelines. 
  Nevertheless, the positive results achieved in developing 
system A opened the way for developing a PRO firing system for 
the Moscow. 
Footnotes 
  1. IZVESTIYA newspaper, 17 June 1992. 
  2. According to Kolmogorov's ideas, PRO firing effectiveness 
was characterized primarily by probability of 
damaging the target. 
  3. For example, in essence the solid circular impact zone 
with strike-ready destructive elements was used in the 
well-known NOE [expansion unknown] experiment in the 
United States in 1984. 
  4. It should perhaps be noted that these calculations were 
among the first to be made at the KB-1 using the first 
Strela [Arrow] computer at this design office and among 
the first in the country.

  [Abstract] The problems of debugging parallel programs are 
discussed. Metho ds of gathering information by tracing are 
described. This information is sufficient to begin analysis 
before one begins debugg ing repeated executions. This article 
proposes a method of autonomous analysis of these event traces 
which enables the user to better understand the behavior of the 
parallel program, reduce the search for errors, and reduce 
debugging tests. The first sec tion describes a method of 
forming and using event traces, and includes a consideration of 
an architecture with shared storage. The creation and use of 
traces of implicit events are addressed. The second section 
presents the autonomous analysis method. This method makes it 
possible to find errors associated with a lack of correlation of 
interacting processes, processes which are execution 
time-independent in some parallel intervals, and implicit events 
which occur when the program is stopped. Competitiv e processes 
are detected. The method is implemented in Turbo Prolog 2.0.

  [Abstract] This article gives a brief outline of the 
parallel cross sections method implemented on a YeS 
multiprocessor computer and presents some results obtained in 
experimental calculations. The basic steps taken to solve a 
system of linear algebraic equations in this computing system 
are described. The system of equations is assumed to include a 
packed matrix. The system is pre-ordered, reducing the matrix to 
a block-diagonal form with edging. The pre-ordering process is 
described. The matrix pre-ordering programs are written in 
Fortran. The second step is the construction of matrix blocks. 
This is followed by construction of external files of initial 
data for the computing system. The results are sent to 
arithmetic processors and the pre-ordered system is solved using 
special algorithms described in this article. Examples are 
presented. Conditions in which this method may be efficiently 
used are described. Figures 3; table 1; references 7 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The possibility is examined for using orthogonal 
Walsh and Fourier matrices for circular testing in linear 
discrete devices and in multiprocessor computer systems of the 
SIMD type. In order check that the logical and arithmetic 
operations are properly carried out, the task of mutual testing 
in a multiprocessor computer system with a distributed floating 
kernel is resolved. It was found that the use of orthogonal 
discrete Fourier and Walsh transforms made it simple and 
efficient to properly control the way logical and arithmetic 
operations are carried out in computers. 4 figures and 8

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  We would like to emphasize certain aspects of the history of 
the development of modeling languages in accordance with the 
accepted classification of its stages and trends.[.sup]1[/] 
Modeling languages are recognized to have made a significant 
contribution to the development of programming languages. 
  By the late 60's, mainly due to the authors of SIMULY-67, 
requirements were formulated for universal programming languages 
so that they could be used to model systems with discrete 
events. In the 70's, this achievement sparked subsequent efforts 
to enrich and combine languages in order to include new classes 
of systems which could be modeled. An example is combined 
(discrete-continuous) systems with a dynamically tuned 
structure. The NEDIS system[.sup]2,3[/] was developed by 
Academician V. M. Glushkov to model this type of system, and was 
used intensively in dozens of design organizations. This was a 
period when modeling language developers were resolving their 
internal methodological problems, and their successes in 
creating means of generating simulation programs to calculate 
the trajectories of systems in some time period derived from 
engineering use of pure mathematics. 
  However, subsequent extensive experience in using the NEDIS 
system and user interaction with the system led to the 
formulation of a number of critical conclusions (see for example 
Ref. 4) which reflected new trends in the automation of design: 

  -  design was increasingly recognized to be a complex 
activity involving simulation and other calculation methods, 
with a key role played by methods based on algebraic 
description, expert systems, databases, etc.; it was felt that 
the transfer and conversion of information in the transition 
from one method to another should be completely automated; 
  -  the languages which were being used did not have the 
declarative capabilities to specify the system model, a plan of 
statistical experiments, and other formal objects of the design 
process as the break was made from an unambiguously understood 
method of interpreting them, and thus could not serve as the 
basis for evaluation and validation of the properties of the 
system and other methods of interpreting the texts of 
specifications. 

    The 80's are characterized by a switch to the development of 
integrated design systems distinguished by a certain 
completeness of the methods used and a much more convenient user 
interface. The more specialized and more stable the area of 
application to which they were applied, the better these systems 
were. At the same time, these systems were poorly developed. The 
problem arose of timely development of specialized systems, and 
consequently, the problem of developing the corresponding tools 
also arose. 
  One would hope that a new stage in the development of 
languages would lead to the development of the following 
capabilities: 

  -  adaptability to dialects of professional groups of users 
(the features of declarability depend substantially on the 
ability to use ``small'' languages[.sup]5[/] that closely 
correspond to the subproblem to be solved); 
  -  the ability to 
support various programming paradigms (in contrast to 
publications like Refs. 6 and 7, page 281); for us, ``supporting 
a paradigm'' means having the ability to effectively develop 
paradigms on the basis of some fundamental version); 
  -  the combination of different methods of research and design 
in 
a single system, that is, based on clearly recognized interfaces 
between them; 
  -  a flexible combination of the processes of interpretation and 
compilation. 

    A language with these characteristics might become an 
adequate technological basis for the construction of interactive 
integrated systems which are open to expansion with the contents 
of interacting functional subsystems, which would share a single 
database and differ in their methods of description and 
processing. 
  This article presents a draft of the NEDIS-90 programming 
system developed by the authors. The system attempts to solve 
some of the aforementioned problems. The following section 
presents a brief overview of the system's programming language. 
The possibility of using the language for modeling is discussed. 
Finally, the current state of work to implement the system and 
plans for subsequent development are discussed. 
<H5>  Modules </H5>
  Programs are assembled from modules, which are compilation 
units. In this case a module usually has a more simple structure 
than in other languages. In a very simple case the text of the 
module looks like a series of operators without any branching. 
In the most general case it consists of a sequence of 
``descriptive'' and ``executed'' segments. A module is a 
variation on the concept of the block: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Module                   |=                        |block                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Block                    |=                        |[operator;] ... [segment]| 
|                         |                         |...                      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Segment                  |=                        |GLOB [description;]...   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         ||                        |LOC [description;]...    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         ||                        |WHERE [implementation;]..| 
|                         |                         |.                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         ||                        |ON [reaction;]...        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         ||                        |INIT [operator;]...      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         ||                        |EXEC [operator;]...      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         ||                        |TERM [operator;]...      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The required initial sequence of operators is considered the 
unheaded segment EXEC. 
  The segments GLOB and LOC are intended to describe classes, 
objects, procedures, and exceptions . Descriptions of GLOB 
segments are public, visible even to other modules. Descriptions 
of LOC segments are completely localized to the given module. 
Implementation of classes and procedures may be presented in 
WHERE segments, and ON segments are intended to describe 
procedures of reactions to exceptions. 
  A module is executed statically in part in the compilation 
stage, and partially dynamically in the program. The static 
actions are described in INIT segments. The dynamic actions of 
the module are divided into preliminary (EXEC segments) and 
final (TERM segments) actions for mutual ordering of the 
execution of modules in a program. 
  Segments of any type may be presented in an arbitrary order 
which is convenient for the programmer, with the only condition 
that they be labelled before they are used. 
  Descriptions of new concepts have a form similar to that 
used 
in Pascal: 
description = label -- descriptor 
  Descriptors define the type of the new concept, and may 
contain information about its in itialization. We limit 
ourselves to the simple example of description of a class of 
complex numbers, a generator function, and an object of this 
class: 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Glob          |complex       |--class       |GLOB          |re -- real;   | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|              |              |              |              |im -- real;   | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|              |              |}             |              |              | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|              |complex([real]|--complex     |proc (x, y)   |              | 
|              |,[real])      |              |              |              | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|              |              |              |result.re = x;|              | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|              |              |              |result.im = y;|              | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|              |              |}             |              |              | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|              |z             |--complex(1.2,|              |              | 
|              |              | 0.6);        |              |              | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  As we can see, the body of the class of complex numbers in 
braces is also a block. In this case it consists only of the 
GLOB segment, the descriptions of the fields re and 
im, which are visible in the current module beyond 
the limits of the body of the class, and which may be used in 
generally accepted constructions like z.re. 
  The generator function block consists only of an unheaded 
EXEC segment. Procedure-functions return the object called 
result. 
  In accordance with the concepts of data abstraction the 
internal device of class is not considered visible in other 
modules, and to define the real part of a complex number we need 
to introduce the special function Re(z): 
  GLOB Re ([complex]) -- static real proc; WHERE Re([complex]) 
-- real proc(w) (results = w.re;); 
  In the first example the class descriptor complex 
includes its implementation. Here we demonstrate the possibility 
of separate ``preliminary'' description and specification of the 
implementation. The key word static is included in 
the descriptors of static procedures and objects which do not 
change state in the process of program execution. 
  The example which is presented may be seen as the beginning 
of the design of a new specialized language of complex 
calculations. The global labels which are introduced in it may 
also be used in other modules, for which the current module will 
be called contextual. 
  On the other hand, several initial concepts are used to 
specify the current module, for example, the class 
real. The list of initial functions for the 
programmed module is always defined by a list of contextual 
modules indicated for it. 
  We note that the names of contextual modules are not 
included 
in the text of the current module and are communicated to the 
compiler as a separate parameter. This makes it possible to 
organize the programming system so that the selection of a list 
of contextual modules, and consequently, the programming 
language, is done automatically, proceeding from the 
professional profile of the user. Even more interesting is the 
ability to use in a module various sets of contextual modules if 
the system of labels that they introduce is invariant. As a 
result, one can state that this module is no more than some 
specification of a system or task, and it may have several 
interpretations. For example, for a single description of an 
electronic device, placing it in a different context one can 
synthesize a structural schematic, verify that certain limits 
are met, execute logical modeling, etc. 
  As a result of compilation of the initial module in 
accordance with some list of contextual modules one develops a 
new contextual module which includes both object code for the 
program assembler and syntax compiler tables to process future 
modules. The module may not introduce new global definitions. In 
this case one will obtain a common object module whose purpose 
is to execute some data processing in the program which includes 
it. On the other hand, a module may be completely intended to 
introduce labels of concepts of some specialized language, and 
may not include executable codes. 
  Any contextual module ``remembers'' the names of its parent 
contextual modules. Thus, the library of contextual modules is 
constructed as an oriented acyclical graph. In order to assemble 
a program, one does not need a project-file; it is 
sufficient to indicate the name of some key (junior) module, and 
the remaining modules, its ancestors, will be included using 
references to the parent modules. 
  The execution of modules in a program is ordered in 
accordance with the following recursive rule: the execution of 
the EXEC and TERM segments of a given module begins with the 
one-time execution of the EXEC segments and ends with the 
one-time execution of the TERM segments of parent modules. Thus, 
the execution of any module in a program begins when the 
necessary tuning has already been done, and after it is 
finished, completion processing automatically follows. 
<H5>  Built-In Modules and Mobility </H5>
  There is a set of built-in contextual modules which are 
terminal nodes of the oriented graph of the library, and 
initially fill it. They describe the description tools of a 
machine (real or virtual) to implement the programming system. 
For example, the aforementioned class real and the 
operations corresponding to it are components of a sublanguage 
defined by the built-in contextual module ARIPH. Below we 
present several other built-in modules: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|CONTROL                               |-typical control structures           | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                                      |(conditional operators, loops, etc.)  | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|REF                                   |-pointer processing                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|BITWISE                               |machine word processing               | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|STRING                                |line processing                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|ARRAY                                 |a generic class of files              | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|STREAM                                |processing of input-output streams    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|FILE                                  |processing of direct access files     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|FORMAT                                |format input-output                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|TASK                                  |coprograms and asynchronous processes | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  As one can see, we do not consider built-in data types, 
operations, or even control structures to be part of the basic 
NEDIS-90 language. Information about them is not concentrated in 
the compiler, and it is relatively easy to change its 
orientation to another machine language. 
  The implementation machine is oriented toward the C 
language, 
which defines the content of the built-in contextual modules. A 
system programmer making the first steps into an ``empty'' 
system is in the position to use a C-like programming language. 
The machine which has been selected is very close in its 
capabilities to a traditional processor and generally accepted 
operating system. In its orientation toward direct generation of 
codes the built-in contextual modules do not require significant 
corrections, but rather implementation of a more exotic logic 
deduction processor or LISP processor for an implementation 
machine. 
  In any case our problem is to compare an implementation 
machine as closely as possible to the filling of built-in 
conceptual modules. Then the programming system can be used to 
adjust to the area of application, beginning with the machine 
command level. This tuning can be done as effectively as 
possible. This does not require any interpreter or a library of 
system functions created outside the programming system with 
another technology. 
  Nonetheless, the problem of the mobility of a software 
language, if it is posed, may be solved by reprogramming the 
secondary contextual modules which it specifies on the basis of 
built-in machine-dependent modules. 
<H5>  Data Types </H5>
  A module may define three varieties of objects: static, 
dynamic, and stored. Static and stored, and sometimes dynamic 
objects, are initialized at the compilation stage. INIT segments 
may include algorithms of any level of complexity and freely 
modify their state. However, later, at the program execution 
stage, static objects may not be modified, and are considered 
constants. Complete monitoring of attempts to modify constants 
is implemented, as is monitoring of types, statically. 
  Constants of typical built-in classes (whole numbers, lines, 
etc.) are considered static objects, and their traditional 
labels are visible in any module. However, due to the reloading 
which is permitted they may be used like any other identifiers, 
in particular, to label user class objects. 
  By the beginning of module execution stored objects 
automatically reset the state acquired as a result of the 
previous run of the module in this or another program. There is 
no access to stored objects outside the module in which they are 
defined, and consequently, control of their integrity is 
completely in the hands of the module developer. Stored objects 
are primitive tools for constructing subsystems and database 
control languages. 
  All objects have a life time which is not directly linked 
with the exit from the description block. The safety of pointers 
is insured by trash collection tools. This is particularly 
important for areas of application associated with delayed 
(lazy) calculations, when access to objects may be preserved 
after one leaves their description block due to established 
dependences. 
<H5>  Effectiveness Issues </H5>
  The NEDIS-90 language is oriented toward the generation of 
effective programs on the level provided by C language compilers. 
  The experience of constructing complex programs like 
compilers or modeling programs has shown that they frequently 
include a large initial tuning code.[.sup]8[/] In order to 
reduce initialization expenditures, one could implement 
statically defined calculations in the compilation phase; 
however, generally used high-level languages do not permit one 
to do this, limiting static calculation to built-in types and 
operations. The introduction of INIT segments makes it possible 
to generate a special program of arbitrary complexity to 
initialize the data of the object modules. An optimization 
examination recognizes statically defined expressions in all 
other segments and moves them into an initialization program. 
  Object-oriented programming has stimulated users to develop 
a 
large number of small procedures. Overhead in the execution of 
calls and context switching can be avoided in some cases if one 
uses an open procedure substitution. Thus, the majority of 
procedures presented in the examples are better defined as open 
procedures. 
  Pointers have a rather complex structure in NEDIS-90 to 
provide tools for dynamic monitoring of types, usually in 
connection with virtual procedures. However any time it is 
possible the compiler uses the simple format of pointers in C. 
  Finally, the closeness of built-in contextual modules to 
machine implementation tools also makes it possible for the user 
to completely control the implementation method of 
problem-oriented languages. 
<H5>  Introduction of Labels and Their Possible Forms </H5>
  NEDIS-90 has rather traditional tools for the development of 
problem-oriented data types and operations based on 
object-oriented programming techniques (classes as user types, 
encapsulation, class inheritance, virtual procedures). What is 
unusual is the ability to develop problem-oriented labels for 
them. Actually the language may be seen as a metasystem which 
permits one to define the syntax of almost any system of labels 
used in some professional language. 
  There is no need to use the Backus-Naur metalanguage or 
similar metalanguages to give the form of labels. The proposed 
method is more like compilation of a syntax map on the left side 
of the description: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|[complex] + [complex] --              |complex proc (x,y)                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                                      |result.re = x.re + y.re;              | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                                      |result.im = x.im + y.im;              | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                                      |}                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Alphanumeric, sign, and literal lexemes are differentiated. 
Alphanumeric lexemes begin with letters or numbers. Literal 
lexemes are written as sequences of graphic symbols in quotes. 
Lexemes of all three types are equivalent and have no predefined 
role. 
  Labels consist of arbitrary sequences of lexemes of any 
type, 
as well as, if necessary, specifications of parameters in square 
brackets. There are no limits on the order of introduction of 
lexemes or parameters. Functions may have a canonical form, the 
form of an infix operation, or any other form. One can assign 
operation priorities. 
  Labels of functions may include specification of default 
values of parameters, variable lists of single-type parameters, 
and the parameter-generators of structural objects. In all cases 
complete static monitoring of types is provided. 
  Let us present an example of the description of a function 
with a variable list of parameters. 
  min ([int], [int] by ,) 
  --int proc (x, y) LOC i -- int; EXE result = x; 
  for i to y# do if (result &gt;  y(i)) result = 
y(i); od; ; 
  and a call of the described function: 
  min(3, 5, 2, 11); 
  The list of arguments 5, 2, and 11 forms a file which 
corresponds to the formal parameter y. The expression y# 
calculates the size of the file. 
  One can reload labels, changing both the type of arguments 
and the type of result. For example, both varieties of 
assignment are provided by the built-in module ARIPH: 
  [*int] = [int] -- static proc; [*int] = [int] -- static int 
proc; 
  which makes it possible to make the following assignment: i 
= 
j = k. 
  The compiler considers the actual system of implicit 
transformations, which is partially built-in, and which is 
partially determined by the user program, for example, with a 
function which generalizes a real to a complex number: 
  [real] -- complex procedure (x) ( result.re = x; 
  result im = 0; ) 
  Parameters can be passed by value, by reference, or by name. 
The simplest argument, in the form of the name of a complex 
variable, can correspond to the following types of parameters: 
  [*complex} - passed by reference in the form of a pointer 
[&amp;complex] to a modified or unmodified variable; 
  [complex] passed by value in the form of a variable copy, 
  but only if the explicit naming function is given, for 
example, 
  [*complex] -- complex proc (x) 
  result.re = x.re; result.im = x.im; 
  [*complex inline] passed by name in the form of a function 
  [&amp;complex inline] to calculate the pointer to the 
variable. 
  Let us examine an example of the definition of a loop 
operator using all three forms of parameter passing: 
  for [*int] from [int(0)] to [int] 
  do [inline] od -- proc (i, lower, 
upper, body) ( i = lower; 
  upto (greater) loop ) if 
(i = upper) greater; body; 
  i +=1; ); 
  ); 
  Implementation of the FOR operator uses a call to the 
procedure UPTO with an argument expression in the form of a call 
of the LOOP procedure, the simplest built-in variety of an 
infinite loop. This case is interesting in that the expression 
is para metric. The corresponding formal parameter, which is 
labelled as greater, is the object of the built-in 
class of out puts (exceptions) and is used as a marker to leave 
the loop. 
  The definition of the UPTO operator is very simple: 
  upto ([ar gum]) [inline(exit)] -- proc(body([exit]) ( 
  LOC break - exit; 
  EXEC body (break); ON 
break - proc (); ) 
  The body of this procedure introduces the exception 
break. Its generation within the parameter-procedure 
body leads to immediate exit with completion of the 
reaction procedure (which in this case is empty). 
  Expressions with parameters, or lambda variables, are 
especially important in programming applications with functional 
or logical styles of programming. 
  The examples which have been presented use tools which are 
defined by built-in contextual modules, and which demonstrate 
the ability to design one's own programming language. They were 
selected so that they would be understandable for programmers, 
and would not require a great deal of explanation, as in the 
case of a modeling language or another problem-oriented language. 
  The basic language is the only thing which should be studied 
by all users in common. We note that it does not include 
built-in classes and procedures, and serves only to develop 
problem-oriented languages. Thus, it is significantly smaller 
than a number of other programming languages. At the same time 
the use of a problem-oriented language requires additional study 
of specific concepts which are defined by the corresponding 
contextual module. Of course this is also true for built-in 
contextual modules. 
  Can one consider NEDIS-90 a true metasystem? Actually, it 
has 
serious limits in the construction of user languages. In 
particular, the following are impossible: 

  -  proposal of one's own compilation unit structure; 
  -  changing the format of descriptions; 
  -  controlling the method of separating literals in the text of 
a 
module, as well as other labels with an a priori sense, as 
occurs, for example, in languages with variables without 
preliminary declarations; 
  -  input of one's own rules for the visibility of labels. 

    Attempts to introduce such tools are possible,[.sup]9[/] 
but may disrupt the relative simplicity of the language and the 
illusion of preserving traditional approaches. 
<H5>  Opportunities for Use in Modeling </H5>
  NEDIS-90 was developed with constant checking of its 
elements 
for correspondence to the problems of designing various 
problem-oriented languages, especially for automation of design. 
The authors were interested in the modeling of combined, or 
discrete-continuous systems. Our problem was to provide the new 
system with the ability to construct a modeling language while 
conserving the main advantages of the old NEDIS language: 

  -  event and process methods of constructing models; 
  -  description of continuous dependences in the form of common 
differential equations; 
  -  no limits on the possibility of alternating fragments which 
establish discrete and continuous dependences if the internal 
logic of the text of the model requires this; 
  -  automatic ordering of the solution of the Cauchy problem 
(equation sorting), in spite of the modular construction of the 
program and dynamic reconfiguration of the modeled system; 
  -  dynamic generation of continuous blocks with common tools for 
generating copies of classes. 

    At the same time, the new system has a number of advantages. 
Developing individual languages (to control experiments, process 
results, etc.) one can divide a program into functional modules, 
as is proposed in Ref. 10. 
  The process method of constructing models is based on the 
built-in concept of a coprogram with an explicit naming system. 
In addition to the generally accepted resume operator 
to switch coprograms, the built-in contextual module TASK also 
defines an operator of asynchronous execution of procedures in 
the stack of the indicated coprogram: 
  plan [*task] for [proc] -- static proc; 
  The plan operator makes it possible to model 
interruption of coprograms. When a coprogram is reset the 
indicated procedure is executed first, then after it is normally 
completed it returns to the interrupt point. Generation of an 
exception makes it possible to move down in the activations 
stack to the trap with the specified reaction. 
<H5>  State of Development and Future Goals </H5>
  At publication, the implementation of the NEDIS-90 compiler 
with generation of programs in C for IBM PC compatible computers 
is complete, and is being comprehensively tested. The main 
difficulty has been implementation of a dynamic syntax analyzer 
which is capable of adapting to the intervention of users in the 
definition of the grammar.[.sup]11[/]. 
  Our initial plans were to place limits on the language 
defined by the user to insure irreversible recognition. It 
turned out that to formulate these limits and to verify their 
execution was too difficult. (Footnote) (One should not confuse 
this with the possibility of verifying[.sup]12[/] that the 
grammar belongs to class LR(k) for a given k.) Moreover, we 
always found interesting problem-oriented languages in conflict 
with the working draft of the limits system. Thus, the final 
version of the syntax analyzer provides parallel examination of 
the alternatives using a bottom-up method. Consequently, the 
implementation of several potential useful properties of the 
language have been simplified , for example, reloading of the 
labels of functions by the type of results. At the same time, 
this recognition scheme is very sensitive to the number of 
implicit transformations given; because there are not goals it 
tries to use them an excessive number of times. There are two 
main types of errors for the syntax analyzer: 

  -  unrecognized syntax construction; 
  -  ambiguous recognition. 

    The latter is the analog of a ``multiply described 
identifier'' error in other languages, and may be the result of 
incorrect assignment of the system of implicit transformation or 
reloading of labels. 
  Unfortunately, the resulting speed of recognition is on the 
order of 1200-3600 lines per minute on a computer with a clock 
speed of 12 MHz, which is not as high as in industrial compilers. 
  The next step should be development of an interactive 
technological programming environment in NEDIS-90. Its 
distinguishing feature should be openness. This means that any 
new program should not differ from pre-existing components such 
as the compiler, dynamic debugger, or text editor. All of them 
must be controlled by a uniform user interface and have access 
to separate control data of the environment. This requires a 
special assembler which is capable of adjusting pointers with a 
consideration of the location of resident programs and 
data.[.sup]13[/] In order to free the constructors of 
interactive applications from the routine need to create syntax 
analyzers for user input, it is proposed that the compiler and 
assembler be implemented in the form of a special built-in 
contextual module. 
  One of the most interesting issues for discussion, which is 
beyond the scope of this article, is the use of the NEDIS-90 
language to construct languages in the declarative style of 
programming and its use in artificial intelligence. Let us 
briefly outline the basic points of the plan to expand the 
language by introducing built-in tools for the processing of 
terms, objects of a special class whose values are coded by 
expressions. 
  Compared to a formal parameter like a term, an argument 
expression is passed to the compiler only in the syntax analysis 
phase. Instead of generating machine commands the recognition 
tree switches to the program execution stage, where it can be 
converted with built-in term operations. By programming some 
``deduction machines'' in a number of cases one can obtain the 
solution of a problem as a result of pure ``transcription'' of 
terms. 
  At the same time, one should provide a built-in function to 
generate a procedure segment using a term value if this 
corresponds to the calculated expression. In conjunction with 
the developed opportunities to use stored data, this makes it 
possible for the user to actively define the balance of 
compilation and interpretation processes. 
  The properties of the procedural paradigm, which is the 
basis for built-in contextual modules, should not prevent the 
development of other styles of programming. For example, 
disruption of an assignment is not a pre-defined operation for 
objects of any class. It is introduced only for object-variables 
of standard types and when necessary can be described explicitly 
for user classes of objects. Procedures (and terms) will be seen 
only as built-in varieties of the concept of a generalized 
function with a predetermined interpretation. The user has the 
right to define his own classes of functions. 
  At present the problem of the conflict of functional 
completeness of term processing tools and the limits which 
proceed from the requirements of static control of types is 
being examined. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The idea of a universal programming language had long been 
an 
attractive one, until it became clear that a key issue was not 
the infinite increase in the number of tools, but a 
generalization of expansio n methods and specialization. The 
practice of specialization is now omnipresent, but it does not 
exist as a technology supported by a single programming system. 
  The NEDIS-90 programming language presented here is intended 
to create program systems with certain problem-oriented 
languages. This is a common compiled object-oriented language 
providing the possibility of constructing user types and 
operations on the basis of known types and operations. It 
includes the opportunity to define a language syntax suited to 
the problem area, but cannot itself contain any built-in type 
and operation descriptions. Implementation of a problem-oriented 
language is registered in the program system as a contextual 
module. The basis consists of built-in contextual modules. They 
correspond to the level of tools of the implementation machine. 
  The initial module may contain calculation fragments which 
are as complex as desired, and these are executed at the 
compilation stage. As a result, all objects described at the 
module level may be initialized at compilation time. The 
language permits work with stored objects to program database 
control tools. 
  A special built-in contextual module defines the primitives 
of the coprogram implementation needed to construct modeling 
languages and parallel execution of programs.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  We would like to emphasize certain aspects of the history of 
the development of modeling languages in accordance with the 
accepted classification of its stages and trends.[.sup]1[/] 
Modeling languages are recognized to have made a significant 
contribution to the development of programming languages. 
  By the late 60's, mainly due to the authors of SIMULY-67, 
requirements were formulated for universal programming languages 
so that they could be used to model systems with discrete 
events. In the 70's, this achievement sparked subsequent efforts 
to enrich and combine languages in order to include new classes 
of systems which could be modeled. An example is combined 
(discrete-continuous) systems with a dynamically tuned 
structure. The NEDIS system[.sup]2,3[/] was developed by 
Academician V.M. Glushkov to model this type of system, and was 
used intensively in dozens of design organizations. This was a 
period when modeling language developers were resolving their 
internal methodological problems, and their successes in 
creating means of generating simulation programs to calculate 
the trajectories of systems in some time period derived from 
engineering use of pure mathematics. 
  However, subsequent extensive experience in using the NEDIS 
system and user interaction with the system led to the 
formulation of a number of critical conclusions (see for example 
Reference 4) which reflected new trends in the automation of 
design: 

  -  design was increasingly recognized to be a complex 
activity involving simulation and other calculation methods, 
with a key role played by methods based on algebraic 
description, expert systems, databases, etc.; it was felt that 
the transfer and conversion of information in the transition 
from one method to another should be completely automated; 
  -  the languages which were being used did not have the 
declarative capabilities to specify the system model, a plan of 
statistical experiments, and other formal objects of the design 
process as the break was made from an unambiguously understood 
method of interpreting them, and thus could not serve as the 
basis for evaluation and validation of the properties of the 
system and other methods of interpreting the texts of 
specifications. 

    The 80's are characterized by a switch to the development of 
integrated design systems distinguished by a certain 
completeness of the methods used and a much more convenient user 
interface. The more specialized and more stable the area of 
application to which they were applied, the better these systems 
were. At the same time, these systems were poorly developed. The 
problem arose of timely development of specialized systems, and 
consequently, the problem of developing the corresponding tools 
also arose. 
  One would hope that a new stage in the development of 
languages would lead to the development of the following 
capabilities: 

  -  adaptability to dialects of professional groups of users 
(the features of declarability depend substantially on the 
ability to use ``small'' languages[.sup]5[/] that closely 
correspond to the subproblem to be solved); 
  -  the ability to support various programming paradigms (in 
contrast to publications like References 6 and 7, page 281); for 
us, ``supporting a paradigm'' means having the ability to 
effectively develop paradigms on the basis of some fundamental 
version; 
  -  the combination of different methods of research and design 
in 
a single system, that is, based on clearly recognized interfaces 
between them; 
  -  a flexible combination of the processes of interpretation and 
compilation. 

    A language with these characteristics might become an 
adequate technological basis for the construction of interactive 
integrated systems which are open to expansion with the contents 
of interacting functional subsystems, which would share a single 
database and differ in their methods of description and 
processing. 
  This article presents a draft of the NEDIS-90 programming 
system developed by the authors. The system attempts to solve 
some of the aforementioned problems. The following section 
presents a brief overview of the system's programming language. 
The possibility of using the language for modeling is discussed. 
Finally, the current state of work to implement the system and 
plans for subsequent development are discussed. 
<H5>  Modules </H5>
  Programs are assembled from modules, which are compilation 
units. In this case a module usually has a more simple structure 
than in other languages. In a very simple case the text of the 
module looks like a series of operators without any branching. 
In the most general case it consists of a sequence of 
``descriptive'' and ``executed'' segments. A module is a 
variation on the concept of the block: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The required initial sequence of operators is considered the 
unheaded segment EXEC. 
  The segments GLOB and LOC are intended to describe classes, 
objects, procedures, and exceptions. Descriptions of GLOB 
segments are public, visible even to other modules. Descriptions 
of LOC segments are completely localized to the given module. 
Implementation of classes and procedures may be presented in 
WHERE segments, and ON segments are intended to describe 
procedures of reactions to exceptions. 
  A module is executed statically in part in the compilation 
stage, and partially dynamically in the program. The static 
actions are described in INIT segments. The dynamic actions of 
the module are divided into preliminary (EXEC segments) and 
final (TERM segments) actions for mutual ordering of the 
execution of modules in a program. 
  Segments of any type may be presented in an arbitrary order 
which is convenient for the programmer, with the only condition 
that they be labeled before they are used. 
  Descriptions of new concepts have a form similar to that 
used 
in Pascal: 
  description = label -- descriptor 
  Descriptors define the type of the new concept, and may 
contain information about its initialization. We limit ourselves 
to the simple example of description of a class of complex 
numbers, a generator function, and an object of this class: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  As we can see, the body of the class of complex numbers in 
braces is also a block. In this case it consists only of the 
GLOB segment, the descriptions of the fields re and 
im, which are visible in the current module beyond 
the limits of the body of the class, and which may be used in 
generally accepted constructions like z.re. 
  The generator function block consists only of an unheaded 
EXEC segment. Procedure-functions return the object called 
result. 
  In accordance with the concepts of data abstraction the 
internal device of class is not considered visible in other 
modules, and to define the real part of a complex number we need 
to introduce the special function Re(z): 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In the first example the class descriptor complex 
includes its implementation. Here we demonstrate the possibility 
of separate ``preliminary'' description and specification of the 
implementation. The key word static is included in 
the descriptors of static procedures and objects which do not 
change state in the process of program execution. 
  The example which is presented may be seen as the beginning 
of the design of a new specialized language of complex 
calculations. The global labels which are introduced in it may 
also be used in other modules, for which the current module will 
be called contextual. 
  On the other hand, several initial concepts are used to 
specify the current module, for example, the class 
real. The list of initial functions for the 
programmed module is always defined by a list of contextual 
modules indicated for it. 
  We note that the names of contextual modules are not 
included 
in the text of the current module and are communicated to the 
compiler as a separate parameter. This makes it possible to 
organize the programming system so that the selection of a list 
of contextual modules, and consequently, the programming 
language, is done automatically, proceeding from the 
professional profile of the user. Even more interesting is the 
ability to use in a module various sets of contextual modules if 
the system of labels that they introduce is invariant. As a 
result, one can state that this module is no more than some 
specification of a system or task, and it may have several 
interpretations. For example, for a single description of an 
electronic device, placing it in a different context one can 
synthesize a structural schematic, verify that certain limits 
are met, execute logical modeling, etc. 
  As a result of compilation of the initial module in 
accordance with some list of contextual modules one develops a 
new contextual module which includes both object code for the 
program assembler and syntax compiler tables to process future 
modules. The module may not introduce new global definitions. In 
this case one will obtain a common object module whose purpose 
is to execute some data processing in the program which includes 
it. On the other hand, a module may be completely intended to 
introduce labels of concepts of some specialized language, and 
may not include executable codes. 
  Any contextual module ``remembers'' the names of its parent 
contextual modules. Thus, the library of contextual modules is 
constructed as an oriented acyclical graph. In order to assemble 
a program, one does not need a project-file; it is 
sufficient to indicate the name of some key (junior) module, and 
the remaining modules, its ancestors, will be included using 
references to the parent modules. 
  The execution of modules in a program is ordered in 
accordance with the following recursive rule: the execution of 
the EXEC and TERM segments of a given module begins with the 
one-time execution of the EXEC segments and ends with the 
one-time execution of the TERM segments of parent modules. Thus, 
the execution of any module in a program begins when the 
necessary tuning has already been done, and after it is 
finished, completion processing automatically follows. 
<H5>  Built-In Modules and Mobility </H5>
  There is a set of built-in contextual modules which are 
terminal nodes of the oriented graph of the library, and 
initially fill it. They describe the description tools of a 
machine (real or virtual) to implement the programming system. 
For example, the aforementioned class real and the 
operations corresponding to it are components of a sublanguage 
defined by the built-in contextual module ARIPH. Below we 
present several other built-in modules: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  As one can see, we do not consider built-in data types, 
operations, or even control structures to be part of the basic 
NEDIS-90 language. Information about them is not concentrated in 
the compiler, and it is relatively easy to change its 
orientation to another machine language. 
  The implementation machine is oriented toward the C 
language, 
which defines the content of the built-in contextual modules. A 
system programmer making the first steps into an ``empty'' 
system is in the position to use a C-like programming language. 
The machine which has been selected is very close in its 
capabilities to a traditional processor and generally accepted 
operating system. In its orientation toward direct generation of 
codes the built-in contextual modules do not require significant 
corrections, but rather implementation of a more exotic logic 
deduction processor or LISP processor for an implementation 
machine. 
  In any case our problem is to compare an implementation 
machine as closely as possible to the filling of built-in 
conceptual modules. Then the programming system can be used to 
adjust to the area of application, beginning with the machine 
command level. This tuning can be done as effectively as 
possible. This does not require any interpreter or a library of 
system functions created outside the programming system with 
another technology. 
  Nonetheless, the problem of the mobility of a software 
language, if it is posed, may be solved by reprogramming the 
secondary contextual modules which it specifies on the basis of 
built-in machine-dependent modules. 
<H5>  Data Types </H5>
  A module may define three varieties of objects: static, 
dynamic, and stored. Static and stored, and sometimes dynamic 
objects, are initialized at the compilation stage. INIT segments 
may include algorithms of any level of complexity and freely 
modify their state. However, later, at the program execution 
stage, static objects may not be modified, and are considered 
constants. Complete monitoring of attempts to modify constants 
is implemented, as is monitoring of types, statically. 
  Constants of typical built-in classes (whole numbers, lines, 
etc.) are considered static objects, and their traditional 
labels are visible in any module. However, due to the reloading 
which is permitted they may be used like any other identifiers, 
in particular, to label user class objects. 
  By the beginning of module execution stored objects 
automatically reset the state acquired as a result of the 
previous run of the module in this or another program. There is 
no access to stored objects outside the module in which they are 
defined, and consequently, control of their integrity is 
completely in the hands of the module developer. Stored objects 
are primitive tools for constructing subsystems and database 
control languages. 
  All objects have a life time which is not directly linked 
with the exit from the description block. The safety of pointers 
is insured by trash collection tools. This is particularly 
important for areas of application associated with delayed 
(lazy) calculations, when access to objects may be preserved 
after one leaves their description block due to established 
dependences. 
<H5>  Effectiveness Issues </H5>
  The NEDIS-90 language is oriented toward the generation of 
effective programs on the level provided by C language compilers. 
  The experience of constructing complex programs like 
compilers or modeling programs has shown that they frequently 
include a large initial tuning code.[.sup]8[/] In order to 
reduce initialization expenditures, one could implement 
statically defined calculations in the compilation phase; 
however, generally used high-level languages do not permit one 
to do this, limiting static calculation to built-in types and 
operations. The introduction of INIT segments makes it possible 
to generate a special program of arbitrary complexity to 
initialize the data of the object modules. An optimization 
examination recognizes statically defined expressions in all 
other segments and moves them into an initialization program. 
  Object-oriented programming has stimulated users to develop 
a 
large number of small procedures. Overhead in the execution of 
calls and context switching can be avoided in some cases if one 
uses an open procedure substitution. Thus, the majority of 
procedures presented in the examples are better defined as open 
procedures. 
  Pointers have a rather complex structure in NEDIS-90 to 
provide tools for dynamic monitoring of types, usually in 
connection with virtual procedures. However any time it is 
possible the compiler uses the simple format of pointers in C. 
  Finally, the closeness of built-in contextual modules to 
machine implementation tools also makes it possible for the user 
to completely control the implementation method of 
problem-oriented languages. 
<H5>  Introduction of Labels and Their Possible Forms </H5>
  NEDIS-90 has rather traditional tools for the development of 
problem-oriented data types and operations based on 
object-oriented programming techniques (classes as user types, 
encapsulation, class inheritance, virtual procedures). What is 
unusual is the ability to develop problem-oriented labels for 
them. Actually the language may be seen as a metasystem which 
permits one to define the syntax of almost any system of labels 
used in some professional language. 
  There is no need to use the Backus-Naur metalanguage or 
similar metalanguages to give the form of labels. The proposed 
method is more like compilation of a syntax map on the left side 
of the description: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Alphanumeric, sign, and literal lexemes are differentiated. 
Alphanumeric lexemes begin with letters or numbers. Literal 
lexemes are written as sequences of graphic symbols in quotes. 
Lexemes of all three types are equivalent and have no predefined 
role. 
  Labels consist of arbitrary sequences of lexemes of any 
type, 
as well as, if necessary, specifications of parameters in square 
brackets. There are no limits on the order of introduction of 
lexemes or parameters. Functions may have a canonical form, the 
form of an infix operation, or any other form. One can assign 
operation priorities. 
  Labels of functions may include specification of default 
values of parameters, variable lists of single-type parameters, 
and the parameter-generators of structural objects. In all cases 
complete static monitoring of types is provided. 
  Let us present an example of the description of a function 
with a variable list of parameters. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  and a call of the described function: 
  min(3, 5, 2, 11); 
  The list of arguments 5, 2, and 11 forms a file which 
corresponds to the formal parameter y. The expression y# 
calculates the size of the file. 
  One can reload labels, changing both the type of arguments 
and the type of result. For example, both varieties of 
assignment are provided by the built-in module ARIPH 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  which makes it possible to make the following assignment: i 
= 
j = k. 
  The compiler considers the actual system of implicit 
transformations, which is partially built-in, and which is 
partially determined by the user program, for example, with a 
function which generalizes a real to a complex number: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Parameters can be passed by value, by reference, or by name. 
The simplest argument, in the form of the name of a complex 
variable, can correspond to the following types of parameters: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Let us examine an example of the definition of a loop 
operator using all three forms of parameter passing: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Implementation of the FOR operator uses a call to the 
procedure UPTO with an argument expression in the form of a call 
of the LOOP procedure, the simplest built-in variety of an 
infinite loop. This case is interesting in that the expression 
is parametric. The corresponding formal parameter, which is 
labeled as greater, is the object of the built-in 
class of outputs (exceptions) and is used as a marker to leave 
the loop. 
  The definition of the UPTO operator is very simple: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The body of this procedure introduces the exception 
break. Its generation within the parameter-procedure 
body leads to immediate exit with completion of the 
reaction procedure (which in this case is empty). 
  Expressions with parameters, or lambda variables, are 
especially important in programming applications with functional 
or logical styles of programming. 
  The examples which have been presented use tools which are 
defined by built-in contextual modules, and which demonstrate 
the ability to design one's own programming language. They were 
selected so that they would be understandable for programmers, 
and would not require a great deal of explanation, as in the 
case of a modeling language or another problem-oriented language. 
  The basic language is the only thing which should be studied 
by all users in common. We note that it does not include 
built-in classes and procedures, and serves only to develop 
problem-oriented languages. Thus, it is significantly smaller 
than a number of other programming languages. At the same time 
the use of a problem-oriented language requires additional study 
of specific concepts which are defined by the corresponding 
contextual module. Of course this is also true for built-in 
contextual modules. 
  Can one consider NEDIS-90 a true metasystem? Actually, it 
has 
serious limits in the construction of user languages. In 
particular, the following are impossible: 

  -  proposal of one's own compilation unit structure; 
  -  changing the format of descriptions; 
  -  controlling the method of separating literals in the text of 
a 
module, as well as other labels with an a priori sense, as 
occurs, for example, in languages with variables without 
preliminary declarations; 
  -  input of one's own rules for the visibility of labels. 

    Attempts to introduce such tools are possible,[.sup]9[/] 
but may disrupt the relative simplicity of the language and the 
illusion of preserving traditional approaches. 
<H5>  Opportunities for Use in Modeling </H5>
  NEDIS-90 was developed with constant checking of its 
elements 
for correspondence to the problems of designing various 
problem-oriented languages, especially for automation of design. 
The authors were interested in the modeling of combined, or 
discrete-continuous systems. Our problem was to provide the new 
system with the ability to construct a modeling language while 
conserving the main advantages of the old NEDIS language: 

  -  event and process methods of constructing models; 
  -  description of continuous dependences in the form of common 
differential equations; 
  -  no limits on the possibility of alternating fragments which 
establish discrete and continuous dependences if the internal 
logic of the text of the model requires this; 
  -  automatic ordering of the solution of the Cauchy problem 
(equation sorting), in spite of the modular construction of the 
program and dynamic reconfiguration of the modeled system; 
  -  dynamic generation of continuous blocks with common tools for 
generating copies of classes. 

    At the same time, the new system has a number of advantages. 
Developing individual languages (to control experiments, process 
results, etc.) one can divide a program into functional modules, 
as is proposed in Reference 10. 
  The process method of constructing models is based on the 
built-in concept of a coprogram with an explicit naming system. 
In addition to the generally accepted resume operator 
to switch coprograms, the built-in contextual module TASK also 
defines an operator of asynchronous execution of procedures in 
the stack of the indicated coprogram: 
  plan [*task] for [proc] -- static proc; 
  The plan operator makes it possible to model 
interruption of coprograms. When a coprogram is reset the 
indicated procedure is executed first, then after it is normally 
completed it returns to the interrupt point. Generation of an 
exception makes it possible to move down in the activations 
stack to the trap with the specified reaction. 
<H5>  State of Development and Future Goals </H5>
  At publication, the implementation of the NEDIS-90 compiler 
with generation of programs in C for IBM PC compatible computers 
is complete, and is being comprehensively tested. The main 
difficulty has been implementation of a dynamic syntax analyzer 
which is capable of adapting to the intervention of users in the 
definition of the grammar.[.sup]11[/] 
  Our initial plans were to place limits on the language 
defined by the user to insure irreversible recognition. It 
turned out that to formulate these limits and to verify their 
execution was too difficult. (Footnote) (One should not confuse 
this with the possibility of verifying[.sup]12[/] that the 
grammar belongs to class LR(k) for a given k.) Moreover, we 
always found interesting problem-oriented languages in conflict 
with the working draft of the limits system. Thus, the final 
version of the syntax analyzer provides parallel examination of 
the alternatives using a bottom-up method. Consequently, the 
implementation of several potential useful properties of the 
language have been simplified, for example, reloading of the 
labels of functions by the type of results. At the same time, 
this recognition scheme is very sensitive to the number of 
implicit transformations given; because there are not goals it 
tries to use them an excessive number of times. There are two 
main types of errors for the syntax analyzer: 

  -  unrecognized syntax construction; 
  -  ambiguous recognition. 

    The latter is the analog of a ``multiply described 
identifier'' error in other languages, and may be the result of 
incorrect assignment of the system of implicit transformation or 
reloading of labels. 
  Unfortunately, the resulting speed of recognition is on the 
order of 1200-3600 lines per minute on a computer with a clock 
speed of 12 MHz, which is not as high as in industrial compilers. 
  The next step should be development of an interactive 
technological programming environment in NEDIS-90. Its 
distinguishing feature should be openness. This means that any 
new program should not differ from pre-existing components such 
as the compiler, dynamic debugger, or text editor. All of them 
must be controlled by a uniform user interface and have access 
to separate control data of the environment. This requires a 
special assembler which is capable of adjusting pointers with a 
consideration of the location of resident programs and 
data.[.sup]13[/] In order to free the constructors of 
interactive applications from the routine need to create syntax 
analyzers for user input, it is proposed that the compiler and 
assembler be implemented in the form of a special built-in 
contextual module. 
  One of the most interesting issues for discussion, which is 
beyond the scope of this article, is the use of the NEDIS-90 
language to construct languages in the declarative style of 
programming and its use in artificial intelligence. Let us 
briefly outline the basic points of the plan to expand the 
language by introducing built-in tools for the processing of 
terms, objects of a special class whose values are coded by 
expressions. 
  Compared to a formal parameter like a term, an argument 
expression is passed to the compiler only in the syntax analysis 
phase. Instead of generating machine commands the recognition 
tree switches to the program execution stage, where it can be 
converted with built-in term operations. By programming some 
``deduction machines'' in a number of cases one can obtain the 
solution of a problem as a result of pure ``transcription'' of 
terms. 
  At the same time, one should provide a built-in function to 
generate a procedure segment using a term value if this 
corresponds to the calculated expression. In conjunction with 
the developed opportunities to use stored data, this makes it 
possible for the user to actively define the balance of 
compilation and interpretation processes. 
  The properties of the procedural paradigm, which is the 
basis 
for built-in contextual modules, should not prevent the 
development of other styles of programming. For example, 
disruption of an assignment is not a pre-defined operation for 
objects of any class. It is introduced only for object-variables 
of standard types and when necessary can be described explicitly 
for user classes of objects. Procedures (and terms) will be seen 
only as built-in varieties of the concept of a generalized 
function with a predetermined interpretation. The user has the 
right to define his own classes of functions. 
  At present the problem of the conflict of functional 
completeness of term processing tools and the limits which 
proceed from the requirements of static control of types is 
being examined. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The idea of a universal programming language had long been 
an 
attractive one, until it became clear that a key issue was not 
the infinite increase in the number of tools, but a 
generalization of expansion methods and specialization. The 
practice of specialization is now omnipresent, but it does not 
exist as a technology supported by a single programming system. 
  The NEDIS-90 programming language presented here is intended 
to create program systems with certain problem-oriented 
languages. This is a common compiled object-oriented language 
providing the possibility of constructing user types and 
operations on the basis of known types and operations. It 
includes the opportunity to define a language syntax suited to 
the problem area, but cannot itself contain any built-in type 
and operation descriptions. Implementation of a problem-oriented 
language is registered in the program system as a contextual 
module. The basis consists of built-in contextual modules. They 
correspond to the level of tools of the implementation machine. 
  The initial module may contain calculation fragments which 
are as complex as desired, and these are executed at the 
compilation stage. As a result, all objects described at the 
module level may be initialized at compilation time. The 
language permits work with stored objects to program database 
control tools. 
  A special built-in contextual module defines the primitives 
of the coprogram implementation needed to construct modeling 
languages and parallel execution of programs.

ELEKTROSVYAZ introduction] 
  [Text]Availability of mobile 
communications to the people of the CIS does not exceed 10 
percent of the mean level in Europe and virtually all existing 
networks are used by state administration agencies. This article 
describes the classification of types of mobile communications, 
features of general use systems with honeycomb structure and 
future satellite systems. The limitation on assigned frequency 
bands compelled VAKR-92 [World Conference of Radio 
Administrations] to allocate new frequency bands for development 
of mobile communications. 
  In the last decades, there has been rapid development of 
mobile ground-based and satellite communication systems in all 
parts of the world. They make it possible for any mobile 
subscribers to communicate with one another, use the general 
communication network, transmit and receive telephone 
communications and digital data. Operation of such systems 
yields profit in the billions. Tens of firms all over the world 
are engaged in production and assembly of equipment for them. 
  In view of the increasing role of mobile communication 
systems, many national communication administrations are 
expanding the frequency bands reserved for their operation. 
Recently, additional frequency bands were also assigned in 
Russia, in the range of 450 and 900 MHz, which should help 
overcome the considerable lag in development of such networks in 
our country, as compared to development of mobile communications 
in Europe and America. 
  Considerably fewer radio stations are in operation in Russia 
and other CIS states than in western countries (one radio 
station per 100 people, which constitutes only 5-10 percent of 
the European level); all networks of mobile communications are 
used by state administration agencies and the ordinary citizen 
is deprived of the opportunity to become a subscriber to the 
mobile communications network. For this reason, there is a need 
for intensive development of networks of mobile communications 
accessible to all in Russia and other CIS states. The importance 
of this matter lies in the considerable economic impact of its 
use, as well as acceleration of furnishing telephone 
communications to many regions of Russia, where availability of 
telephones is quite low. 
  Ground-based systems of mobile radio 
communications are divided into the following types: 

  -  general use radiotelephone systems 
  -  RSOP; 
  -  technological dispatcher networks 
  -  TDS; 
  -  personal pagers [beepers] 
  -  SPV; 
  -  emergency communication systems 
  -  SAS. 

    The RSOP is intended for communication between any mobile 
subscribers, as well as their access to the municipal and 
sometimes intercity network. As a rule the RSOP has one base 
station (BS) that services 2000-5000 subscribers over an area 
with a radius of 30-50 km. Communication between them, as well 
as access to the general use network, is effected through the BS. 
  In recent years, all over the world there has been intense 
development of RSOP with a honeycomb structure, that makes quite 
efficient use of the frequency band assigned to them. In such 
networks, there are several tens of BS in a city or region, each 
of which operates over a radius of 1-2 km. Altogether, these BS 
service 100,000-200,000 subscribers. Honeycomb networks require 
more complicated equipment and software, used to control the 
flow of information between BS. 
  TDS are intended for control of industrial operations and 
technological processes in construction, agriculture, railroad 
services, river fleet, municipal services of cities, systems for 
control of gas line operation, power lines, etc. 
  SPV began to be used relatively recently, and they serve to 
transmit signals from one or several BS to mobile subscribers 
situated in a specific territory. They enable any subscriber to 
the general telephone network to access SPV subscribers. Their 
distinction is that there is no two-way communication channel. 
To respond, the mobile subscriber must use a telephone, 
telegraph or any other available channel. SPV are often 
organized by means of multiplexing the FM UHF channels of 
broadcast transmitters with radio access signals in the pauses 
between transmissions. The range of SPV is 30-40 km, and it 
serves 10,000-20,000 subscribers. There are systems for not only 
individual, but also group paging. 
  SAS are used by state administration agencies, and have been 
developed the most in the maritime and aviation services, where 
they are used to transmit distress signals, including automatic 
ones. 
  In CIS states, 10 frequency bands have been assigned to 
mobile communication systems: I (1.6-30 MHz); II (33-48.5 MHz); 
III (57-57.25 MHz); IV (74-74.6 MHz); V (75.4-76 MHz); VI 
(146-174 MHz); VII (300-308 MHz); VIII (336-344 MHz); IX 
(451-466 MHz) and X (890-960 MHz). These bands are used not only 
by mobile communication systems, but also other radio systems. 
For this reason, assignment of frequencies for a new network 
presents a serious problem, and it is resolved by communications 
agencies in each specific instance. 
  These 10 bands are divided mainly according to type of 
mobile 
communications: I-VIII are used in TDS networks; I-VI in SPV. As 
a rule, band I is used to organize long-distance communications 
in inaccessible regions; band II is one of the most used, since 
hundreds of thousands of radio stations of various departmental 
networks (emergency medical aid, militia, etc.); band III is 
intended for organization of intraplant [intrafarm] and 
intraregional communications in rural regions; bands IV and V 
are used essentially to organize communications at construction 
sites; the networks for railroad technological communications, 
as well as services of the petroleum and gas industries and 
electric power complex, operate in bands VI and VII. 
  RSOP uses bands VII and IX, and the latter band was assigned 
recently to deploy, for example, the honeycomb systems in Moscow 
and St. Petersburg, which were assembled using NMT-450 equipment 
purchased abroad. The question of using band X in Russia must be 
resolved in the near future. It is planned to develop RSOP using 
the latest equipment of the general European GSM standard, which 
operates in the frequency ranges of 450 and 900 MHz. On the one 
hand, this will provide subscribers with a wide range of 
services and, on the other hand, it will permit quite efficient 
use of the frequency band assigned to mobile communications, so 
that networks with a large number of subscribers can be 
organized. In CIS states alone, we expect a 10-15-fold increase 
in number of mobile radio stations. 
  The GSM system, use of which has already begun in FRG, 
France, Italy, Great Britain and other countries, was developed 
by a team of experts in mobile communications of the European 
organization SEPT.[.sup]1[/] It is expected that the network 
of this system will cover 10 million subscribers by 1995 and 15 
million by the year 2000. In addition to new services related to 
digital transmission of signals, GSM provide for privacy of 
communications. 
  Considering the prospects for development of industry and 
agriculture in Russia and the fact that it is moving closer to 
the European market, it should be conceded that it is desirable 
to have speedy development of this system in Russia. For this 
reason, we can only welcome the production of equipment for the 
900 MHz range planned by several Russian enterprises. 
  The PCN[.sup]2[/] [Personal Communications Network] system 
will be another promising international system of mobile 
communications, and several Russian enterprises are undertaking 
production of equipment for it. 
  Satellite systems of mobile communications (SSS) 
are an effective means of organizing communications in the 
maritime, air and ground services. 
  Commercial operation of SSS was started in 1982 by the 
international organization INMARSAT, which comprises more than 
50 countries including Russia. Stations for this system, 
designed to provide for maritime and aircraft communications, 
can be installed on trucks that make long-distance runs, 
railroad cars, aircraft and vessels. At the present time, the 
system services up to 700 ships cruising in the Atlantic, Indian 
and Pacific oceans. Communications are established via a 
geostationary IS3 [artificial satellite] and stationary 
ground-based station. The system uses ranges of 6 and 4 GHz 
(coastal ground-based stations), 1.6 and 1.5 GHz (ship- and 
aircraft-based stations). The annual income to the INMARSAT 
organization is about 160 US dollars. 
  INMARSAT provides the following types of services: 
telephone, 
telegraph and fax communications, transmission of data, 
reception of signals from satellite radio navigation systems. 
Since 1992, personal radio paging is also provided, which 
permits INMARSAT users to receive brief texts displayed on a 
monitor by means of a personal device weighing 400 g. 
  National SSS systems are being developed in many countries 
of 
the world. In the United States, for example, it is planned to 
start up a system in 1995 that will service up to 270,000 users 
with the possibility of accessing the general telephone network. 
This system will provide for transmission of data and 
organization of dispatcher communications, in addition to 
ordinary telephone communications. 
  In Russia, the Marafon -- a specialized national satellite 
system for land, sea and air mobile communications -- is being 
developed with consideration of the INMARSAT experience. Marafon 
will satisfy the acute need of our country for mobile 
communications in all types of transportation, and it will 
resolve the problem of providing reliable communications to the 
most remote and inaccessible regions. 
  It is planned to start up the first line of this system in 
1993 for 2000 subscribers, and their number will reach 50,000 by 
the year 2000. The cost of the system should be returned after 
9-11 years of operation. 
  Satellite systems of scanning radio paging with subscriber 
receivers the size of a credit card have gained wide use in the 
last few years. The low-cost receivers can operate out of doors, 
in buildings and vehicles. Since 1986, such a system has been 
undergoing test operation in Great Britain, and it permits 
paging truck drivers on the roads of West Europe, the Mideast 
and Africa. 
  In the United States, a satellite system of scanning radio 
paging has been put in operation, and it services more than 50 
major cities in that country. Many regional ground-based radio 
paging services in the United States are integrated by means of 
space communication channels. 
  One of the main factors retarding RSOP development is the 
limited radio frequency spectrum. Considerable difficulties are 
involved in assignment of additional parts of the spectrum for 
RSOP, and for this reason almost half the items (9 out of 21) on 
the agenda of the World Conference of Radio Administrations on 
Assignment of Frequency Bands (VAKR-92) had a direct bearing on 
this problem. 
  In the relevant Table of Band Assignment of the 
International 
Radio Communications Regulations, there are are virtually no 
frequency bands assigned on an exclusive basis to the mobile 
service (with the exception of maritime and air mobile services 
directly related to providing for safety of human life). In 
addition to spectrum overloading, this circumstance limits the 
possibility of meeting the needs for organization of mobile 
radio communications. 
  For this reason, it was conceded at the VAKR-92 that it is 
imperative to broaden the spectrum for mobile services, and 
discussions arose only on different details of the problem, in 
particular, matters of compatibility of mobile services with, 
for example, the stationary service already using these parts of 
the spectrum. 
  The conference approved the decision to raise the status of 
the mobile service to a primary rank in the 1700-2450 MHz band. 
The Russian delegation proposed limitation to a 1710-2110 Mhz 
band since the 1700-1710 MHz band is used extensively to receive 
meteorological information from satellites, the 2110-2450 MHz 
band is needed for the stationary service (radio relay lines), 
while the 2200-2290 MHz segment is needed for space-earth and 
space-space communication lines in space research services. In 
the opinion of Russian specialists, questions of electromagnetic 
compatibility of the mobile service with these important 
stationary services have not been sufficiently explored. Since 
the same apprehensions were voiced by other delegations, VAKR-92 
asked MKKR [International Radio Consultative Committee] to 
investigate the problem of compatibility of these services and 
develop the technical criteria for joint use of frequencies. 
  The VAKR-92 assigned the frequency bands of 1670-1675 MHz 
(ground-aircraft) and 1800-1805 MHz (aircraft-ground) to 
administrations thatwish to use such systems for communications 
with aircraft. In Canada, the United States and Mexico, 849-851 
and 894-896 MHz bands, respectively, are already being used for 
such purposes. Thus, a dual set of onboard equipment will be 
needed on aircraft that will fly between zones with different 
frequency assignments. 
  At the VAKR-92, assignment of spectrum segments for 
satellite 
mobile services was the subject of the main discussions. This is 
attributable to the fact that the typical distinction of the 
present stage of using space communications equipment is the 
desire to make broad use of nongeostationary, including 
low-orbit, satellites. The reason for this is that the 
feasibility of using a geostationary orbit is close to being 
saturated in several ranges, and geostationary satellites in 
circumpolar regions are not very efficient because of the small 
angles at which radiowaves reach ground stations. Systems with 
low-orbit satellites also have higher power characteristics of 
communication lines, which is particularly important when using 
cheap portable ground-based terminals with nondirectional 
antennas. 
  Lengthy discussions revolved around several specific parts 
of 
the spectrum, which it was proposed to assign to the satellite 
mobile service, which uses nongeostationary earth satellites: 
137-138 MHz, 148-149.9 MHz, 149.9-150.05 MHz, 400.15-401 MHz, 
and 1610-1626.5 MHz. The 137-138 MHz band was divided into 4 
segments, and the satellite mobile service (space-earth) was 
assigned the 137-137.025 MHz and 137.175-137.825 MHz segments on 
a primary basis, 137.025-137.175 MHz and 137.825-138 MHz on a 
secondary basis. 
  Such separation of the band was made because of the fear of 
several countries, including the Russian Federation, Belarus and 
Ukraine, as well as SEPT nations, that this new service could 
create problems in using existing ground-based mobile services. 
The 148-149.9 and 400.15-401 MHz frequency bands were assigned 
to the satellite mobile service on a primary basis. Limits were 
set for power flow density near the earth's surface in the 
137-138, 148-149.9 and 400.15-401 MHz bands to protect existing 
ground-based services. These bands are permitted for use only by 
nongeostationary satellite systems, provided steps are taken to 
protect radioastronomic observations in the 150.05-153 and 
406.1-410 MHz frequency bands. 
  At the suggestion of the Russian Federation, Belarus and 
Ukraine, a satellite mobile service was included on a secondary 
basis in the 312-315 MHz (earth-space) and 387-390 MHz 
(space-earth) bands. This permits development of Gonets [racer], 
a Russian system of satellite mobile communications, was 
included in the Table of Frequency Assignment of the Radio 
Communications Regulations on a secondary basis, and it will now 
be rid of the complicated coordination procedure that is 
mandatory for all analogous services in the 235-322 and 
335.4-339.9 MHz frequency bands. 
  At the VAKR-92, it was decided to distribute 50 MHz at a 
time 
in each direction to the satellite mobile service, scheduled to 
be done by 1 January 2005, to meet its growing needs. In the 
meantime, there are several problems to be solved concerning 
control of reciprocal interference between the satellite mobile 
service and existing ground-based services. 
  There was particularly sharp discussion of suggestions on 
assignment of the 1610-1626.5 MHz band to the satellite mobile 
surface. A suggestion was advanced by the United States that 
proposed the use of this band for development of a global system 
of mobile communications. One of the plans of the Motorola firm 
proposes to develop a system of 77 low-obit satellites at an 
altitude of 770 km in circumpolar orbits. Each satellite with 37 
pencil beams would generate 37 coverage areas [``honeycombs''] 
each about 670 km in diameter near earth's surface. On a global 
scale, total carrying capacity of the system will be 377,000 
duplex telephone channels (240 channels per honeycomb). 
  In its report to the VAKR-92, the MKKR concluded that the 
frequency bands for air and maritime radio communications and 
radio navigation that are related to assuring safety of human 
life should not be viewed as candidates for satellite mobile 
services. The conference, however, disregarded this conclusion 
and, under pressure of the U.S. delegates, adopted the proposed 
decision. 
  In order to protect the GLONASS system, the Russian 
delegation was compelled to record a special statement in the 
concluding minutes of the VAKR-92. 
  On the whole, the decisions of the VAKR-92 pertaining to 
mobile services are indicative of the increasing interest in new 
types of communications, mainly for general use.

  [Text] The rapid world development of 
telecommunications has brought the advent of new kinds of 
telecommunications networks that are the basis for organizing a 
variety of telecommunications services (telex, fax, e-mail, and 
so on). In future it may be possible to merge various services 
and networks on the basis of digital networks with integration 
of services. Such networks are already in operation in some 
world nations; however, universal introduction will take a lot 
of capital investments. 
  Considering the current status of development of 
telecommunications and data networks in Russia, it can be 
concluded that networks like the X.21 data network with digital 
channel switching, or a digital network with integration of 
services will hardly be widely prevalent in our nation in the 
near future. Therefore, the authors believe that the problem of 
quickly establishing an up-to-date infrastructure in Russia to 
support integration of various telecommunications services can 
be solved only on the basis of X.25 networks with packet 
switching. Networks of this kind, when used as a universal 
transport medium for data transmission in combination with 
additional servers, are an effective and comparatively 
inexpensive means of support for all services, and provide the 
basis for their integration. The feasibility of such an approach 
is demonstrated in this article as exemplified by development of 
the INFOTEL network. 
  Characteristics of INFOTEL network. The INFOTEL 
network provides up-to-date communications services on a 
commercial basis for different classes of users, as well as 
supporting their interaction with the resources of other data 
processing networks of Russia and other nations. This network 
has been set up by using the communications infrastructure of GP 
[not further identified] ``Moscow Municipal Telephone 
Communications'' and the communications enterprises of other 
cities (municipal telephone networks, ``Rossvyazinform'' GPSI 
[not further identified] and so on). 
  Information is exchanged in the INFOTEL network by the 
packet 
switching principle. This network utilizes international 
standards and recommendations on public data networks, and 
specifically CCITT Recommendations X.25, X.3/X.28/X.29, X.75, 
X.121. The INFOTEL network uses CCITT international code (DNIC) 
2504. INFOTEL interacts with 190 foreign data networks via the 
DATEX-P network operated by the Deutsche Bundespost Telecom 
Company. 
  The hardware base of the INFOTEL network is series EWSP 
equipment made by Siemens (Germany): 
  1. HNN/HMS packet switching centers (200 ports, 1500 
packet/s) combined with a network control center; 
  2. HNN packet switching centers (100 ports, 1500 packets/s); 
  3. HNN-20 packet switching centers (20 ports, 200 
packets/s); 
  4. modems for operation over dedicated and switchable 
communication channels, physical lines; 
  5. multiplexers of various types for organizing discrete 
channels. 
  Long-distance and international communication channels, 
including satellite channels, are used to organize data 
transmission between users in other cities. Packet switching 
nodes are connected by dedicated communication channels with 
transmission speed of 9,600-64,000 bauds; transmission rates on 
subscriber sections are 1,200-64,000 bauds. 
  Subscriber access is over dedicated digital AF channels and 
physical lines, as well as over switchable channels of the 
public telephone network and the ``Iskra-2'' network. Provision 
is also made for calling a subscriber on the network side via 
the telephone network. There are different options for 
connecting subscriber stations to the data network: 
  a) by X.25 protocol using dedicated communication channels 
or physical lines; the user's computer must have an X.25 
interface (and appropriate software) and a modem for operation 
over the dedicated communication channels that implements one of 
the CCITT Recommendations V.22, V.22 bis, V.29 or V.32. 
  b) by X.28 protocol using switchable communication channels 
(public telephone network and ``Iskra-2'' digital telephone 
network), and also dedicated channels or physical lines; to 
implement this connection option, the user must have a 
communications software package and a modem that implements one 
of the CCITT Recommendations V.22, V.22 bis or V.32, and also 
V.42/V.42 bis or MNP-4/MNP-5. 
  In addition, the Network Administration may offer the user a 
V.35/V.36 or G.703 interface for connection to the INFOTEL 
network over a dedicated channel with rate of 64,000 bauds. In 
isolated cases, the dedicated channel to the user may be 
organized over an already existing telephone pair with parallel 
transmission of speech and data (at a rate of up to 19,200 
bauds). 
  Connected to packet switching nodes as subscribers are 
e-mail 
servers that also offer services to network users. On the first 
stage, the network uses servers that are compatible with the 
Internet/RELCOM e-mail network (mainly based on IBM 386/486 
personal computers under control of the UNIX operating system), 
and that also enable transmission and reception of telex, 
teletype and fax messages. 
  Thus, thanks to the use of the X.25 network as a transport 
medium and e- mail servers as facilities for delivering 
additional services, the INFOTEL network provides the following 
basic services: 
  rapid and reliable data transmission (text and binary files, 
electronic documents, software and other forms of information); 
  on-line (interactive) access to remote information and 
computing resources (databases, information retrieval systems, 
electronic bulletin boards, and so on); 
  data transmission in e-mail mode; 
  data transmission and reception in e-mail mode of telex and 
teletype messages, and transmission of fax messages; 
  output to other data networks, including foreign networks. 
  In essence, the package of services offered is the merging 
of 
capabilities of an X.25 network and systems that have been 
developed in Russia mainly on the basis of telephone networks. 
However, analysis of the current level of development of 
telecommunication services shows that this service package is 
far from complete (for example, there are no services for 
electronic data processing or transmission of fax message with 
temporary storage). 
  To expand the list of services offered by the INFOTEL 
network, a multicommunication system (MCS) is being 
introduced that will integrate the following services into a 
unified hardware/software platform: 
  X.400 e-mail; 
  electronic data exchange; 
  telex; 
  teletype; 
  megaFAX transmission of fax messages with temporary storage; 
  physical delivery of correspondence; 
  voice mail; 
  electronic bulletin boards. 
  The MCS is based on an X.25 packet switching data network. 
In 
addition, the MCS can be accessed via telephone, telex and 
teletype networks as well. The hardware base of the MCS is 
provided by the Tandem Company's fault-tolerant computers, and 
by centrally controlled Tandem computers for fax transmission 
with temporary storage. 
  As base software, the MCS uses OSIware's Messenger 400 
system 
that implements Recommendation X.400 1984/1988 and is compatible 
with European and U.S. profiles for implementation of X.400. 
  The Messenger 400 system is modular, and includes the 
following modules: 

  -  message transmission agent (MTA) Messenger 400/MTA -- 
there are two versions of the MTA: 1984 and 1988. The 1984 
version contains session and transport levels. The network level 
protocol may be X.25, TCP/IP, or a proprietary asynchronous 
protocol: TTXP; 
  -  User agent (UA) Messenger 400/UA -- this module is in one of 
the computers with MTA and interacts with it via a software 
interface that is functionally coincident with P3 protocol; 
  -  interface with physical delivery service (Messenger 400/PDAU) 
that sends hard copies of messages from X.400 users by 
conventional mail; 
  -  remote user agent support [by other than P7 X.400 protocol 
for 
support of interaction with the UA in a personal computer, 
including support of error-correcting protocols like Xmodem, and 
by P7 X.400 protocol (Messenger 400/RUA) for implementing 
functions of P7 protocol, including the application level]; 
  -  file storage (Messenger 400/MS) -- supports P7 protocol for 
remote UA access, and P3 protocol for interaction with the MTA; 
  -  directory services (not X.500); 
  -  electronic data exchange services. 

    The e-mail service can be accessed in the 
interactive mode from a terminal (PC), telex, teletype using 
service functions of the UA integrated into the system, and also 
in the packet mode from a PC using local software that 
implements UA functions. 
  The electronic data exchange system provides 
exchange of electronic documents via the X.400 e-mail system, 
and also supports EDIFACT, ODETTE, TRADACOMS and ANSI X12 
standards. This system has the following capabilities: 

  -  conversion of user application data; 
  -  standard formatting of documents; 
  -  checking document formats; 
  -  support of controlling messages; 
  -  support of different versions of standards; 
  -  document routing; 
  -  interface for application-specific software. 

    The megaFAX system controlled by a Tandem computer 
consists of megaFAX nodes connected via an X.25 network. A 
megaFAX node supports input/output, storage and transmission of 
fax messages, as well as a gateway to the X.400 system. The 
latter provides for fax output of messages generated by e-mail 
users (telex, teletype, text messages), and interfacing with 
other systems of the same kind; 
  The megaFAX system is accessed from group 3 fax machines 
with 
the capability of using: voice menus (possibly including 
Russian); the megaTEL device by which the operator can work in 
the same procedure as with a telephone network. 
  The X.25-based megaFAX system provides: 

  -  fax broadcasting (999 addresses) with user-friendly 
editing capability; 
  -  fax transmission at sender-specified time; 
  -  fax reception from a mailbox at any time convenient for the 
user; 
  -  automatic repetition of fax messages (voice detected, no 
answer, busy, access denied); 
  -  capability of user storage of standard blanks; 
  -  fax delivery to alternative addresses if the main number is 
busy or not working (up to three user-specified addresses); 
  -  abbreviated addressing of subscribers (users may maintain 
their 
own address books, including company name, lines with names of 
recipient and sender, alternative fax number); 
  -  message delivery priorities; 
  -  fax transaction reports; 
  -  closed user groups (fax transmission permitted only within a 
user group); 
  -  delivery of reports regarding user work to a predetermined 
device (X.400 mailbox, fax mailbox, max machine, and the 
like). 

    In conclusion, we would like once more to mention that 
the INFOTEL data network is today one of the most intensively 
developing Russian telecommunications networks that were not put 
on the Russian market until late last year. In spite of this, it 
already covers about twenty regions of the Russian Federation. 
In 1993-1994, plans call for setting up packet switching centers 
in regional centers and in the most important cities of Russia 
over the entire territory of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Levin: ``Three Quarters of a Century Later: </F>
Kaskad NPO and Siemens Resurrect Cooperation''] 
  [Text] Who would have thought that one of the world's 
largest ``electronics'' firms today--Germany's Siemens--was the 
forefather of the recently still supersecret Kaskad NPO 
[Scientific-Production Association], which served for a long 
time as the center for design of Soviet missile and space 
systems and communications technology? Of course, the roots of 
this story go back into the middle of the last century, when the 
young engineers Karl Siemens and Johann Halske founded the Main 
Telegraph Shop in Russia. 
  In those distant years, the Siemens-Halske Trading House did 
many useful things for the Russian state--it laid the world's 
first telegraph cable line between St. Petersburg and Kronstadt, 
linked practically all of the country's major cities by 
telegraph, and during the Crimean War of 1883-1856 it extended a 
telegraph line from Moscow to Odessa, and from there to 
Sevastopol, an object of fierce fighting. The list of 
interesting facts connected with the activity of Siemens and 
Halske in Russia also contains this: The first telephone 
conversation between St. Petersburg and Malaya Vishera occurred 
in November 1879 using telephone instruments equipped with a 
signaling whistle, designed by these two German inventors. 
  Things began to go downhill for the Main Telegraph Shop 
Joint-Stock Company in October 1917. Two years after the 
revolution the joint-stock company was nationalized, the Germans 
were run out, and a new name appeared on the sign--Elektrotest, 
RSFSR Supreme Council of the National Economy, which the 
enterprise possessed until its renaming in 1977 as the Kaskad 
NPO. Work proceeded in the association under strict secrecy: 
This is where they designed, introduced and serviced strategic 
missile systems of all generations and powerful antimissile and 
antispace systems, and created modern computer equipment, 
communications apparatus and all kinds of other ``smart'' 
electronics. They say, by the way, that the NPO retained the 
traditions of Siemens, inasmuch as it always had construction 
and installation subdivisions occupied in the manufacture, 
assembly and adjustment of telecommunications systems. 
  Conversion opened the road to searching for new forms of 
activity, and to cooperation with foreign firms. It was then 
that the ``fathers'' of Kaskad remembered their German 
``relative'' and decided to restore the old contacts. Thus last 
year the Agreement on Providing Agency Services and on Wholesale 
Trade was signed between the Kaskad NPO and Siemens, while just 
this January a department for the sales and service of Hicom 
institutional automatic telephone exchanges made by Siemens 
appeared in the NPO. 
  This was all communicated at a press conference held in June 
in Moscow's President Hotel by executives of Kaskad, the RF 
Ministry of Communications and Siemens. From this day forward, 
in addition to maintaining its ``classical'' profile, the NPO 
will acquire a new one--it will become the official 
representative of Siemens in Russia, and it will introduce 
Hicom-100 communications equipment--small institutional 
automatic telephone exchanges with a capacity of up to 64 
numbers--into our communication networks. It will also 
introduced Hicom-300 digital institutional exchanges, which make 
up a modern TsSIS [not further identified] system making it 
possible to transmit speech, data, facsimile and teletype 
information, and are intended to connect from 30 to 10,000 
subscribers. All of these exchanges are adapted to our networks, 
and are certified by the RF Ministry of Communications. 
  Kaskad has already received more than 50 orders to install 
Hicom systems, including from the communications departments of 
presidential and government organizations, enterprises of 
aviation and automotive industry, and a number of joint firms 
and commercial organizations. In order to make development of 
the new market more effective, to raise competitiveness and to 
pursue a coordinated investment and technical policy, the 
association established an international joint-stock company of 
the same name. 
  Many who were present at the press conference wondered if 
``invasion'' of Kaskad by Siemens might damage our defense, in 
behalf of which the NPO is still successfully working. 
Resolutely rejecting this possibility, Russian Minister of 
Communications V. B. Bulgak assured those present that such 
cooperation will bring nothing but benefit. And when he went 
into some generalities on the topic of imports of communications 
equipment in the recent past, today and in the future, the 
minister presented a number of interesting figures. 
  As it turns out, prior to the 1990s 65 percent of all 
automatic telephone exchanges and 30 percent of cables laid in 
the USSR were foreign-made, particularly in CEMA countries and 
Yugoslavia. Just in the last 10 years 1,140 exchanges were 
acquired from the former Yugoslavia. Today, Russia still 
continues to purchase 45 percent of its communications equipment 
on the basis of international credit, although according to V. 
B. Bulgak the situation will change in a year or a year and a 
half. Joint ventures established in our country during this time 
will gear up their work to full capacity, and things that had 
been acquired before from across the border will be produced for 
the most part in Russia. 
  All right then, if Siemens EWSD automatic telephone 
exchanges 
are already being set up in Kiev, why not organize production of 
the same Hicom exchanges in Moscow, let's say, with the 
participation of Kaskad? Well, while such an idea is only food 
for thought, Kaskad and Siemens are beginning to work together 
once again, like in the times of the Telegraph Shop.

621.396.93] 
  [Text] The appearance of cellular mobile radio 
communication (SPR) networks in Russia's Interlinked 
Communication Network (VSS) revealed some additional vulnerable 
places in the organization of the electric communication sector, 
and posed new problems of network control before science. 
  The problems of the sector's development are aggravated by 
the difficulties in the economy, and in particular: 

  -  the higher cost of raw materials, supplies, energy 
resources, and construction and installation work; 
  -  the practical absence of Russian-made communication equipment 
satisfying modern requirements; 
  -  the unfavorable exchange rate of the ruble, which makes major 
purchases of imported equipment impossible with the existing 
financing volumes; 
  -  unfinished processes of the sector's management and 
privatization; 
  -  obsolete standards and guidelines. 

    Broad sections of the radio spectrum continue to be 
inaccessible to new communication services. 
  At the same time there are factors which are acting in favor 
of the development of new communication services, systems and 
resources: relatively low cost of microelectronic equipment per 
telephone number, especially of digital transmission and 
switching systems, in comparison with traditional systems; the 
prospects for allocating sufficient frequency bands making it 
possible to develop the network not by laying cable lines but by 
organizing radio systems of various configuration, both in 
cities and in the countryside. 
  Such radio systems have enjoyed wide application abroad, and 
are beginning to be introduced in our country. Thus, two 
cellular mobile radio communication networks have been operating 
since 1992--in Moscow and in St. Petersburg. In that same year 
two standards were adopted in the Russian Federation for 
cellular mobile radio communication systems--NMT and GSM. 
Adoption of still other standards is possible--PCN, DECT etc. In 
addition, creation of regional networks in the 830-890 MHz band 
on the basis of the DAMPS standard has been permitted. A 
competition was conducted for the right of designing and 
operating SPR networks on the basis of the GSM standard in 
different regions of Russia. 
  However, the process of creating public SPR is far from 
smooth. In order that the correct decisions could be made, let 
us analyze some of the problems that have arisen during 
development of mobile communication networks in Russia. 
<H5>  Interaction of SPR With the VSS </H5>
  Owing to the disintegration of the USSR, the Interlinked 
Communication Network, or the Unified Automated National 
Communication Network (YeASS) is undergoing a deep crisis 
brought about by upgrading of interrepublican networks to the 
international level, displacement of financing sources locally, 
and elimination of centralized leadership. On this backdrop, 
greater interest in establishing SPR networks, the status of 
which had been until recently at the level of the status of 
departmental communication networks, adds to the overall chaos. 
  In fact, neither the Main Directions for Development of the 
YeASS [1] nor the guidelines on the General State System of 
Automated Telephone Communication (OGSTfS) [2] contains a 
definition of public mobile radio communication, of which SPR is 
a variant, and of its role in the YeASS (VSS). Document [2] is 
obsolete regarding mobile radio communication and conflicts with 
[1]; even so, it has not been rescinded. It is because of this 
in particular that uncertainty exists in the means of connecting 
mobile radio communication networks to the OGSTfS. 
  Connection of SPR with the rights of a hundreds and a 
thousands group and with the rights of regional dial telephone 
systems and local telephone networks with a 90 code is 
permitted. The terms of the competitions carried out for the 
best plan for organizing cellular networks clearly require 
connection to the AMTS [automatic long distance telephone 
exchange] with a 90 code. This is possible only for one cellular 
net in a region. But considering the future, we need to foresee 
a series of codes for local networks, for example on the basis 
of the NMT or GSM or PSN standard. In the initial stage, when 
the network is servicing a small number of subscribers, the 
number capacity is used wastefully (one code of the local net 
representing 100,000 numbers). 
  In addition, assigning such codes to the SPR involves 
technical difficulties in a number of regions due to the lack of 
AMTS equipment, the need for laying new connecting lines, and in 
Moscow, moreover, exhaustion of the number capacity. 
  These and other problems of developing public mobile radio 
communication are in my opinion the consequences of unanswered 
questions involving interaction of mobile radio communication 
networks with the VSS. The main question is this: What is public 
mobile radio communication--individual networks existing as 
foreign appendages to the OGSTfS, a system of electric 
communication not having independent significance, a statewide 
system like the OGSTfS, or something else? And the problem lies 
not in the difficulty of the definition but in the 
unpreparedness and reluctance of specialists to tackle the 
problem head-on. As a result the debate rages over the question 
as to whether to connect the mobile radio communication net to 
the OGSTfS at the local or the transit level, and the 
corresponding recommendations have already been adopted and are 
being distributed through the country. But great difficulties 
arise in fulfilling these recommendations, because we still 
don't have any answers to the more general questions, such as: 
Will a unified national mobile radio communication network be 
created, and on what principles; what should be the mutual 
relations between this network and the OGSTfS? 
  A well-coordinated solution can be found if we recognize the 
obvious: Public mobile radio communication is a more general 
communication system than the OGSTfS. In fact, under this 
condition we do away with the questions as to the independence 
or dependence of mobile radio communication, and as to a unified 
network, because SPR should doubtlessly be united into a unified 
national network integrated with the OGSTfS. The number system 
needs to be common with the OGSTfS, as should the signaling 
system. On the other hand questions regarding connection of 
networks should be resolved only with regard for technical 
feasibility, on the basis of the general principles of creating 
and developing SPR networks and the OGSTfS. Adoption of the 
concept of unity of SPR and the OGSTfS means creating a new 
supermonopolistic electric communications structure. 
  And so, unity of the systems would mean the following: 

  -  common principles of network organization; 
  -  standardization of requirements on equipment interfacing 
parameters; 
  -  common number and signaling systems; 
  -  common requirements on subscriber services. 

    Now a few words about the last item. The monopoly in 
electric 
communications has important significance. In order to break it 
up, we need to have as many independent companies as possible 
participating in providing communication services. In this case, 
as a rule, territories and subscribers are divided among 
different service companies in accordance with a permit to 
operate (a license). No special problems arise in servicing 
ordinary subscribers. But mobile subscribers who are not 
associated with any particular territory must be serviced 
anywhere. This is very important, and companies operating mobile 
communication networks must service all SPR subscribers with the 
same quality, without differentiating between ``ours'' and 
``theirs.'' This requires coordination of the actions of the 
companies. Unified standards need to be adopted for each band, 
equality of access to acquisition of licenses must be ensured, 
and legislative acts protecting the rights of subscribers must 
be written and adopted. These functions may be carried out by 
the Ministry of Communications, but on the condition that it 
does not act as an economic agent. 
<H5>  The System of Mutual Settlements </H5>
  With the disintegration of the old centralized communication 
system into a number of independent organizations, problems 
arise associated with fair distribution of rate income. 
  Several structurally, financially and legally independent 
organizations may participate in the acquisition of the end 
product (communication services), for example: a mobile radio 
communication network; a local telephone network (city or 
rural); an intercity telephone station; a trunk line 
communication network. 
  When intercity connections are made between mobile 
subscribers, the number of independent organizations 
participating in this may reach up to seven. They all have a 
rightful claim upon part of the funds collected from subscribers 
for the communication services rendered. The soil for acute 
conflicts between the indicated organizations is created. This 
is manifesting itself especially clearly in the creation of new 
SPR networks. In such a situation there is an extremely great 
need for working out the principles of mutual settlements and 
developing the corresponding standards. 
  Three variants are possible: 
  1) adoption of a general agreement between interested 
parties 
regarding the share of participation in providing communication 
services, and the distribution of rate income corresponding to 
this order; 
  2) adoption of an agreement on distributing rate income on 
the basis of arriving at identical profitability; 
  3) distribution of rate income in proportion to the service 
load. 
  The first two variants are technically simple, because they 
do not require additional solutions, but they are very complex 
in terms of reaching agreement between the agreeing parties. In 
addition once an agreement has been reached, it may be put into 
question after a while, because the conditions of interaction 
are constantly changing. 
  The third variant requires that we solve a number of 
technical problems, the main one being installation of devices 
by which to register the load. But this variant is the fairest, 
because it permits an objective assessment of the share of the 
participation of each of the parties in providing communication 
services. 
  The share of income enjoyed by each organization 
participating in providing communication services must be 
proportional to its investment. The following approach can be 
proposed as a means of determining the latter. 
  We conditionally divide all rate income into three 
categories. In the first, we include income from services 
provided only to ``one's own'' subscribers--for example, 
assigning a subscriber's number, installing and moving 
subscriber equipment, and so on; in the second--income from 
services provided to any subscribers regardless of membership to 
the network (different additional forms of services); in the 
third--income from services which are provided with the 
participation of different organizations, for example 
connections between subscribers of different networks. 
  Payment for the services of the first and second categories 
should go to the networks and organizations providing these 
services, while payment for services in the third category 
should be distributed between the organizations that participate 
in the process of providing them. In this case the share of 
income received by telephone stations, SPR networks and 
intercity stations must be proportional to the service load, 
while the share of income of trunk line communication networks 
must be proportional to the number of channels used to organize 
the connections, their length and the time they are used. 
  The statement of communication services rendered that is 
received by a subscriber must be drawn up with regard for all of 
these components, but there must be only one; otherwise the 
subscriber would receive several statements for each call or 
other service, which is inconvenient. 
  Unfortunately the requirement of having a single statement 
is 
not easily fulfilled. The fact is that with introduction of 
cellular networks and time-based payment for telephone calls in 
city and rural networks, the problem of establishing accounting 
centers to collect charges from subscribers arises. Such centers 
exist today only under the AMTS, and they service subscribers 
using intercity communication. In the meantime establishing 
accounting centers for each network could hardly be considered 
to be the optimum solution. 
  From my point of view the best variant is to create an 
independent accounting center that would service all networks of 
its regions having a need to maintain accounts with subscribers 
and mutual settlements with other networks. Such a center would 
draw up and send the subscriber an integral statement of 
services rendered on the basis of information on connection 
rates, and conduct mutual settlements among the communication 
networks on the basis of information on the service load or the 
share of participation in providing communication services. The 
center could be established on the basis of the accounting 
center of the AMTS, to be separated out as an independent 
organization later on. 
<H5>  Management of the Frequency Spectrum </H5>
  The purposes of managing the frequency spectrum are to 
distribute and redistribute it among users in order to achieve 
its optimum, economically effective use. 
  The system currently existing in the country, the functions 
of which include distributing the spectrum and monitoring it 
(the State Commission on Frequency Distribution under the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Communication, the State 
Inspection Office of Electric Communication of the Russian 
Ministry of Communication, the network of territorial agencies 
of the State Inspection Office of Electric Communication 
(oblast, kray, republican), the technical monitoring stations, 
and city radio monitoring points, does not unfortunately have a 
criterion for the effectiveness of the spectrum's use, owing to 
which it is still being distributed out of some ``higher'' 
rather than economic considerations. This is doing a great deal 
of harm. An example of this is mobile radio communication. It 
hasn't developed much at all in the last 10-15 years because of 
the refusal to allocate legal sections of the spectrum foreseen 
by the Regulations on Radio Communication for priority use by 
mobile radio communication. 
  The ``powerful'' sectors have enjoyed the most favored 
treatment in the spectrum's distribution: defense, state 
security, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of 
Communication, insofar as this aids in reaching ideological 
objectives. The resulting situation was unable to stimulate 
economy of the spectrum, or progress of communication resources 
in general. 
  Another significant shortcoming of the existing system of 
the 
spectrum's management is subordination of the indicated agencies 
to the Ministry of Communication. And this means that 
distribution and monitoring functions are concentrated for 
practical purposes in the same hands, which doesn't do anything 
to raise the level of management. 
  Thus economical approaches never existed, and they don't 
exist today. There are many examples of this. Despite some 
changes, bands are allocated as before, on the basis of the 
residual principle, for mobile radio communication. Thus, only 
small sections of the 800-900 MHz band have been allocated, 
which will not be able to satisfy the needs of SPR when 
communication systems working on the GSM standard are introduced 
on a wide scale. International bands allocated for GSM equipment 
in all of Europe, and foreseen by the Radio Communication 
Regulations, are to be closed indefinitely in our country. We 
are once again laying our on ``rut,'' different from the general 
European track. 
  Need we remind ourselves that the spectrum is as much a part 
of our national wealth as are oil, gas, coal etc.? And we'll 
deplete it as well. Incorrect distribution of the spectrum would 
be analogous to its plunder: It brings no income to the state, 
and besides that, the consequences are hard to correct, because 
the sector accumulates a large mass of equipment that cannot be 
simply shifted to another frequency band. 
  The need for managing the spectrum by economic methods has 
been around a long time. The spectrum must have value; it must 
be fought for with the ruble. Significant changes are needed in 
the work of agencies responsible for the spectrum's 
distribution, and namely: 
  1) The State Commission on Frequency Distribution must not 
be 
a part of any ministry. It must be an independent agency, for 
example under the Government or the Supreme Soviet; 
  2) when the spectrum is distributed among users, the 
effectiveness with which the allocated frequency bands are used 
must be accounted for mandatorily. This requires development and 
approval of the procedure for determining it; 
  3) electric communication inspection offices and technical 
radio monitoring stations must be taken out of the organization 
of the Ministry of Communication, and they should become 
independent agencies; 
  4) the right to use a portion of the spectrum to operate 
equipment within a certain territory must be granted on a 
competitive basis to local electric communication inspection 
agencies under the oversight of the State Inspection Office; 
  5) licenses must be issued for a limited term. The value of 
the license must be determined by auction. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  These questions are only a small part of the problem of 
organizing mobile communication networks. The sector is 
presently on the threshold of great changes. Integration of 
communication services on a single digital basis is beginning, 
and the status of a mobile subscriber is being extended to 
ordinary telephone network subscribers with the introduction of 
personal radio communication. In this case the latter is 
significantly more important than may appear at first glance. 
  Owing to sharp growth of prices of cable products and of 
construction and installation work, and growth of operating 
expenses, some telephone networks are already trying to set up 
telephone services by introducing radio systems, without waiting 
for the appearance of personal radio communication systems. In 
this situation we need to resolve the questions of interaction 
between old and new networks, of frequency regulation, and of 
introducing an effective system of mutual settlements as quickly 
as possible.

GP: ``Conference in Dubno''] 
  [Text] A scientific-technical conference titled ``Satellite 
Communication Systems in the Transition to Digital Methods of 
Data Transmission and Their Metrological Support'' was held here 
in June. Opening it, Yu. M. Fomin, chairman of the organizing 
committee and chief engineer of the Kosmicheskaya Svyaz GP [not 
further identified], noted that one of the main trends in the 
development of radio communication resources is transmission of 
different types of information by digital methods. This trend is 
determined by the qualitative indicators of digital 
communication channels, by the possibility of using them to 
transmit all kinds of information, and by the existence of a 
promising foundation of digital components upon which to base 
the equipment. 
  Academician V. L. Bykov, a pioneer in space communications 
in 
our country and the founder and permanent scientific leader of 
an international experimental satellite communications center, 
which is leading the effort to introduce the new 14-11 GHz 
frequency band, gave a report on the topic ``Problems of 
Introducing New Frequency Bands in Satellite Communication and 
Broadcasting Systems.'' The academician described work being 
done in this field in foreign countries, in Japan for example, 
where they are not introducing the 14-11 GHZ band, having 
upgraded directly to the 30-20 GHz band; he also discussed 
creation of a unified world communication system and work in the 
field of digital television. 
  Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor A. A. Pirogov, a 
well 
known scientist, reported on his new theoretical work ``On the 
Need of Accounting for Time-Weighted Nonlinear Distortions in 
Telephony.'' Because transmission of telephone messages makes up 
a considerable share of the load of the satellite-borne relay 
stations of satellite communication systems, it is important to 
account not only for nonlinear distortions in the 
analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion channels at 
maximum telephone signal level, but also for mean 
(time-weighted) nonlinear distortions. The report's author 
established in his research that even maximum distortions 
K[.sub]tmax[/]=24 percent at a signal level of 
X[.sub]max[/]=1 are practically unnoticeable, while 
relatively small distortions turn out to be significant at 
X=(0.15-0.25)X[.sub]max[/]. A. A. Pirogov proposed a formula 
making it possible to normalize the mean (time-weighted) 
harmonic coefficient K[.sub]&Ggr;[/], 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-55A>      FORMULA </FIG>

  [Text]In addition in the case of telephone 
signal transmission to input and output circuits by the discrete 
amplitude modulation or single side band methods, in order to 
reduce distortions and raise the efficiency of amplifiers at the 
voltage of power supplies, regulation ``by the envelope'' of the 
modulated signal should be abandoned in favor of doing so ``by 
the envelope'' of level X of the modulated signal, determined by 
syllabic frequencies F[.sub]max[/]=75 Hz, as is widely done 
abroad. This improves signal quality, raises efficiency, and 
does not cause appearance of emissions outside the band. 
  In his other report, ``Discrete Representation of Semantic 
(Meaningful) Symbols of Speech or Telephone 
Signals--Conversation Via a Low-Speed Telegraph Channel and 
Microphone Control of Machines,'' A. A. Pirogov noted that 
hundreds of thousands of discrete low-capacity channels should 
become the most important field of application of space 
communication systems. If a single standard channel can transmit 
discrete information at a speed of up to 100-200 Mbits/sec 
(given a certain easing of the requirements on the error 
probability to P=10[.sup]-3[/]), we can also use it to 
organize N=(0.4-1.3)|b10[.sup]6[/] partial discrete 
communication channels of low capacity of 150-250 bits/sec each, 
or N=(0.83-3.3)|b10[.sup]5[/] vocoder channels with a 
capacity of 1.2-0.6 kbits/sec. Such channels, which are very 
inexpensive and reliable, are extremely necessary in Russia's 
vast territory. Eight million vocoders servicing congressmen, 
business, farmers and others are presently operating in the 
public switching network of the USA. Experience in creating such 
space communication channels of even lower capacity already 
exists in the world (INMARSAT--emergency buoys). The speaker 
noted that serious attention needs to be turned to something he 
proposed as much as 30 years ago--using maximally effective 
primary description of telephone (speech) signals on the basis 
of the phonetic (semantic) function 
  P(_o_,t)=lg [S(_o_,t)/s(_o_,t-_t_)]. 
  where S is the spectral density of the signal at frequency 
_o_. In 1977 the French scientist Lenar [transliteration] used 
this algorithm to break the French language down into an 
alphabet of 627 semantic elements (diphons), and now the French 
can converse on discrete channels with a capacity of 150-250 
bits/sec, control machines with a microphone, and identify a 
voice at the input of an analog-to-digital converter. 
  Interest was shown in a report by Doctor of Technical 
Sciences, Professor N. T. Petrovich on the topic`` Problems of 
Radio Contact With Extraterrestrial Civilizations,'' in which he 
summarized some results of international theoretical and 
experimental efforts to reveal possible signals from 
civilizations on other planets. The main conclusion is that 
extraterrestrial civilizations probably exist, and are sending 
us signals. By improving the search for them and the methods of 
their reception, in the professor's opinion radio contact could 
be established with them. 
  V. Kalachev, a representative of the USA's well-known 
Hewlett-Packard, expressed his gratefulness for the invitation 
to the conference, and described his firm and its readiness to 
cooperate. 
  A report by Candidate of Technical Sciences K. I. 
Martyshevskiy, a laboratory chief at the NIIR [not further 
identified],`` Methods and Resources for Measuring Onboard 
Satellite Communication Relay Stations on the Ground and in 
Flight Design Tests,'' was devoted to problems associated with 
testing multichannel satellite-borne communication and 
broadcasting relay stations of satellite communication systems. 
Methods of measuring the main parameters of relay stations such 
as the amplitude-frequency characteristic, GVZ [not further 
identified], K[.sub]y[/], noise, frequency instability, and 
channel indicators were examined, and a block diagram and the 
principal qualitative indicators of an automated testing complex 
(AIK) for conducting the complete cycle of ground testing of all 
types on relay stations carried by the Gals direct television 
broadcasting system were presented. The AIK can measure the 
technical characteristics of any channel of a satellite-borne 
relay station, and record measurements automatically by computer. 
  Reports by NIIR chief metrologist E. V. Tetiyevskiy and 
TsISM 
(VISM) [not further identified] Metrology Department chief N. 
Ya. Medovikov were devoted to the problems of certification and 
metrological support. 
  Norms of the International Telegraph and Telephone 
Consultative Committee pertaining to the error factor, slip and 
phase jitter, the methods of measuring them with and without 
interrupting communication, and the characteristics of modern

  [Text] A description is provided of the principal 
requirements contained in the Regulations on the System of 
Technical Diagnosis of Thermal Power Steam and Hot-Water 
Boilers. 
  Tens of thousands of small steam and hot-water boilers, 
supplying communal and industrial needs for steam and hot water 
are currently in operation in Russia. The constituents of this 
thermomechanical equipment are heterogeneous both in design and 
technological features and with respect to product service life, 
safety and reliability factors, and other indices. More than 
80% of the small boiler units produced before the 
beginning of 
the 1970s are operating at the present time beyond the limits of 
the design operating life. The quality of operation remains a 
significant problem for this equipment. 
  Under these conditions, operational reliability is 
determined 
entirely by the timely and effective implementation of measures 
for the carrying out of technical diagnosis and by subsequent 
repair and initial preparation operations. However, until the 
present time a unified methodological and engineering approach 
to the tasks of diagnosis and to the problem of rational 
prolongation of reliable operating life has not been worked out. 
  Finally, instructional materials on the many modifications 
of 
small boilers, regulating the necessary scope and periods of the 
monitoring of the state of the metal during the period of the 
design service life, are lacking. 
  These problems have been eliminated by the Regulations on 
the 
System of Technical Diagnosis of Industrial Power Steam and 
Hot-Water Boilers, developed by a collective of authors (Russian 
Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight; the Scientific 
Production Association, Central Scientific Research, I. I. 
Polzunov Planning and Design Institute on Boilers and Turbines; 
VNIIAM [unexpanded acronym - All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute of Nuclear Machine Building]; the Scientific 
Production Association, Central Scientific Research Institute of 
Machine Building Technology, boiler-building plants, and other 
enterprises). The Regulations cover steam boilers with a 
pressure greater than 0.07 MPa to 4.0 MPa and hot-water boilers 
with a water-heating temperature greater than 115ÎC. The 
principle of ensuring safety during the assessment of the 
technical status of boilers in relation to potentially dangerous 
elements of construction or its components that are most 
stressed, operating in the most severe and difficult conditions, 
is the basis of the Regulations. The selection of potentially 
dangerous components is made on the basis of information on the 
design features of the boilers, the conditions of their 
operation, and statistical data on their failure rate. The 
frequency, methods, and scope of the monitoring of the technical 
status of the boilers, as well as the norms of the evaluation of 
the limiting condition with respect various diagnostic 
parameters, are established by the Regulations on this basis. 
  The estimation algorithm for the technical status of the 
boilers, the structure of which is designed for the period of 
design service life as well as beyond its limit, is the 
foundation in the Regulations for carrying out the diagnostic 
operations. This structure includes the content and sequence of 
the necessary stages of the operations to establish the 
possibility and conditions of safe operation. 
  The content of the stages of the operations to assess the 
technical status of boilers is set forth in the corresponding 
sections of the Regulations: analysis of the the design features 
and of the technology of the manufature and conditions of the 
boilers (sec. 4); actual examination of boilers (sec. 5), which 
includes the use of a complex of nondestructive monitoring 
methods; the investigation of the condition and properties of 
the metal (sec. 6), and, finally, check strength calculation and 
estimation of residual life (sec. 7). 
  The norms for the assessment of the technical status on the 
basis of the results of the technical diagnosis as applied to 
the geometrical dimensions and to the mechanical properties and 
defects of the basic metal and of welded, forged, and riveted, 
joints, are presented in sec. 8. 
  The requirements for the formal presentation of the results 
of the technical diagnosis and the prognosis of the possibility 
and conditions of the further operation of the boilers are set 
forth in the concluding sec. 9 of the general part of the 
Regulations. 
  The analysis of the actual status of long-operating boiler 
equipment is presented in the Regulations. The boilers are 
divided in groups A and B, the first of which represents 
equipment with operating periods within the limits of 20 to 40 
years, the second of which, longer than 40 years. Critical 
standards on the status of the construction elements, the 
properties and structure of the metal, and the results of 
hydrolic testing. The procedures in case of a deviation from 
limiting conditions and designations of the following scopes of 
diagnosis and repair, as well as the conditions of further 
operation, are regulated. 
  Practical aspects of the technical diagnosis of various 
types 
of boilers are also considered in the Regulations; the program 
of technical diagnosis of the most common types of boilers of 
domestic manufacture, the MZK, E1/9, PKN, PTZM, PTVM, DKV, DKVR, 
etc., within the limits of the design period and after its 
expiration, are presented. In keeping with the approach adopted 
in the main text of the Regulations, potentially dangerous 
components of the design of boilers on the drawings are 
considered, and the methods and scopes of criterional 
evaluations of the technical diagnosis results indicated. 
Recommendations are given for the formal presentation of the 
results of the diagnosis and the preparation of the conclusions 
regarding the possibility, periods, and conditions of the 
further operation of boilers. 
  Overall the Regulations have been devised to provide 
assistance to the operating personnel of industrial boiler, 
installation, repair, and diagnostic enterprises and 
organizations in the ensurance of the reliable and prolonged 
operation of boiler equipment on the basis of the effective 
solution of the problems of technical diagnosis. 
  The Regulations have been published and can be ordered 
through the following address: DIEKS, 125047, Moscow, P. O. Box

for evaluating (for the extent and methods of inspection) the 
state of the base metal and welded joints have been developed. 
The concept of the creation of the Regulations Regarding 
Extension of the Life of the Equipment and Pipelines of NPP with 
VVER Reactors is presented. 
  The problem of monitoring the safe operation of NPP whose 
design life has elapsed has become urgent in many countries. For 
example, in the USA more than 2/3 out of 110 nuclear power 
plants in operation with a design life of 40 years have operated 
more than 10 years. Upon expiration of design life, license 
renewal is required [1]. 
  In Russia, out of 13 units in operation with VVER type 
reactors, with a design life 30 years, six units have operated 
for more than 10 years; three, more than 20 years; and none of 
them have exhausted design overhaul period. 
  Design life is an arbitrary value that is determined by 
economic considerations related to the equipment pay-back. The 
strength analysis and analysis of neutron radiation-induced 
embrittlement of the metal of the reactor vessel, of corrosion 
losses, etc., are based on the design life. A reliable basis for 
extension of the life exists, if it is found that actual 
operating conditions have been milder than the design conditions. 
  In the European countries there are no clear limitations for 
NPP design life (as compared with Russia and the USA). It is 
held that the principle of maintaining the level of safety and 
reliability achieved at the newest NPP should be adhered to in 
the case old plants. Thus, in 1988 a system was introduced in 
Germany for evaluating whether the safety level of each NPP, 
after no more than 10 years of operation, is meeting current 
specifications of safety standards. 
  An approach to the possible extension of NPP life should be 
based on guaranteeing safe operation, taking into account 
physical aging and obsolescence of constructions, systems, and 
equipment. In assessing the possible extension of the life, it 
is necessary to keep in mind that the effect of reactor 
radiation background on service and maintenance personnel 
intensifies with time, since gamma-radiating radionuclides 
accumulate during operation in equipment, pipelines, thermal 
insulation, structural constructions, and other elements. 
  In the present paper, the authors consider only that part of 
the NPP life extension problem which is related to the 
reliability of equipment and pipelines. 
  In the USA, the NRC has developed a final version of 
Regulations specifying the procedure for the extension of the 
standard NPP life. There is still no analogous document in 
Russia. 
  At present, Russia is experiencing a deep recession. The 
construction of new NPP has practically ceased. A severe limit 
on adding new capacities has been introduced at thermal power 
stations. Therefore, to maintain the necessary level of 
electrical and thermoelectrical power consumption in industry, 
transport, communal economy and agriculture, the maintenance of 
the equipment of thermal power stations and nuclear power plants 
in working order when their design life is over becomes an 
important matter. Such extension is possible in the following 
cases: actual reliability (durability) margins have been wide 
enough; actual operating conditions have proven to be less 
rigorous than those envisaged in the design; and after 
restorative repair of physically deteriorated equipment elements 
or partial replacement of the equipment. 
  Extension of operating life is all the more pressing in that 
the removal from service and dismantling of NPP equipment and 
structural constructions with its subsequent burial or partial 
recovery are very expensive. At the present time, the Russian 
economy does not have enough resources. A simple plant shutdown, 
maintaining a minimal number of employees and plant security 
does not prevent dissemination of [fission product] activity 
into the environment (atmospheric and aqueous). A plant that has 
been shut down presents an increased hazard in extreme natural, 
techno- or anthropogenic circumstances. 
  According to estimates of US specialists, given NPP life 
extension from 40 to 60 years, the US economy alone would gain 
more than 100 billion dollars. 
  Extension of the life of PWRP equipment seems the most 
promising. The possibility of extending the operation of 
equipment and pipelines is governed to a significant degree by 
the fact that the temperature of its metal is relatively low, up 
to 300!C. This ensures relative stability of metal properties. 
Equipment service life is limited by failure rate due to 
radiation-induced embrittlement, heat aging, metal fatigue, and 
corrosional and erosional wear. 
  The degree of radiation-induced embrittlement of a reactor 
vessel is a crucial factor at some electrical power stations 
both in Russia and in Eastern Europe, etc. The problem of 
radiation-induced embrittlement caused by intense neutron 
radiation is urgent only for the shells and welds of a reactor 
vessel in the region of the active core. In Russia 12Kh2MFA and 
15Kh2MFA steels that are more resistant to radiation than 
foreign steels were used for the vessel of the first generation 
reactors. However, the diameters of reactor vessels were 
smaller, and, due to this fact, the fast neutron flux density 
was greater. This was governed by the requirement that the 
reactor vessel be transportable by railway. 
  In Russia electrothermal processing of vessels of first 
generation VVER-440 reactors has been perfected and successfully 
carried out. The shell in the active core area is subjected to 
thermal processing to eliminate neutron radiation-induced 
embrittlement. This procedure may be carried out repeatedly. It 
is based on the elimination of crystal lattice imperfections 
induced by neutron flux during tempering or restoration of the 
plastic properties of the metal. Two options, thermal processing 
of a vessel and its replacement in case of embrittlement, have 
been examined abroad. 
  Corrosion damage, namely continuous thinning, tuberculation 
and corrosion cracks, can be monitored by nondestructive 
materials testing and by test cuttings from sections subjected 
to the most intense wear, known from operating experience and 
from the premises of design solutions. Erosional thinning can be 
easily found during visual inspection or thickness metering 
using nondestructive methods. 
  Metal susceptibility to failure caused by its fatigue can be 
eliminated at the stage preceding crack formation by means of 
local heat treatment, with high-temperature tempering [2, 3]. 
The metallophysical mechanisms of serviceability restoration for 
a cyclically work-hardened metal are far from identical to those 
for a heavily irradiated metal; however, their overall effect is 
identical, namely, the restoration of initial serviceability 
following tempering. 
  In an analysis of the status of the equipment, carried out 
following the expiration of the design life, taking into account 
constructional considerations, margins of safety, actual service 
conditions, crack detection results, and experience in ensuring 
reliability within the limits of design life that are accepted 
in the process of design engineering, the inference is entirely 
possible that partial equipment replacement is necessary. 
  There has been experience In Russia and abroad with the 
replacement of such bulky and expensive elements as steam 
generators even within the limits of operating life time. 
  The need for the partial replacement of equipment when 
extending of the life of an NPP can also be governed by latent 
possibilities of increasing the overall efficiency of an 
industrial plant (increase in the power generated, decrease in 
operating costs, etc.) that were not defined more precisely in 
the design process. 
  Extension of the life of old NPP units with VVER-440 and 
VVER-1000 appears promising; in order to ensure their further 
safe operation, this includes inspecting the equipment and 
pipelines of NPP units which are entering, according their 
design, their final operating stage, the identification of 
actual residual life of equipment and pipelines, and if 
necessary subsequent partial rebuilding or technological 
retooling. 
  Over the course of several years, in connection with the 
approaching end of the life of the equipment of NPP with 
VVER-440, some enterprises and organizations in former Comecon 
countries undertook the task of creating RRegulations Regarding 
Extension of the Life of Equipment and Pipelines of the Primary 
Circuit of NPP with VVER-440 ReactorsS [4, 5]. Because new 
capacities of NPP with VVER-1000 reactors have been intensively 
put into operation, and in connection with plans for developing 
NPP with new generation VVER, and, subsequently, in the context 
of the disintegration of Comecon, these efforts ended nearly at 
the final stage. However, the ideas that had been presented at 
that stage are evidently rational. It is worthwhile to return to 
this point, having covered the equipment of secondary and 
auxiliary circuits, and taking the specific requirements for the 
equipment of NPP with VVER-1000 into account. The Regulations 
Regarding Extension of the Life of the Equipment and Pipelines 
should specify the conditions and the procedure for determining 
the possibility of extending the life beyond the design. The 
Regulations are intended to substantiate the possibility of 
further operation of NPP units with VVER reactors; this does not 
exclude the possibility, if necessary, of replacing some 
equipment elements when their repair proves to be impossible or 
inadvisable. 
  The possibility of extending the life of the equipment and 
pipelines of NPP units needs to be confirmed by strength and 
overhaul period calculations, taking into consideration the 
results of investigation of special properties of the metal, the 
inspection of actual equipment status, and actual operating 
conditions. The recording of identified construction and 
manufacturing defects, as well as of failures during the 
operation of specific types of equipment, is also necessary. 
  The principal objective of the above-mentioned Regulations 
consisted in developing the specifications to the scope and 
methods of inspection of the base metal and welded joints of the 
equipment and pipelines; and in the selection and establishment 
of the criteria for evaluating the status of the base metal and 
welded joints of the equipment and pipelines that had outlived 
the projected life. 
  The Regulations should be unique within the full set of 
normative-technical documentation on ensurance of the reliable 
and safe operation of nuclear power facility equipment and 
pipelines. These Regulations are subject to coordination and 
approval by oversight organs and are mandatory for organizations 
and enterprises involved in the planning, designing, 
manufacturing, assembling, repairing, and operating of NPP 
units, as well as for organizations which develop programs and 
support and carry out operations to extend the life of NPP units. 
  The main equipment and pipelines, i.e., the reactor pressure 
vessel, steam generators, main gate valves, distributing rings 
of reactor coolant pumps, reactor coolant pipes, pressure 
compensators, main steam headers of steam generators, hydraulic 
accumulator of the emergency core cooling system, etc., are also 
covered by these Regulations. 
  The equipment enumerated has large overall dimensions, is 
hard to replace, and has a long manufacturing cycle. The 
Regulations contain brief characterizations of the equipment, 
indicating its operating conditions, specific features of its 
design, and the specific characteristics of construction 
materials used. In this section, principal requirements on the 
status of the material of specific equipment should also be 
listed. 
  In the development of the Regulations, all the equipment has 
been divided into two classes: the equipment of the primary and 
secondary circuits. In the process, experience with conformance 
inspection, in-service inspection, and repair of the equipment 
of the relevant NPP units with VVER has been taken into account. 
  Five to seven years prior to expiration of the life of NPP, 
control charts for the equipment elements are developed for each 
specific unit. Control charts contain at least the following 
information: equipment name; a sketch; the extent of zones and 
types of control; equipment manufacturer's name; the material, 
procedure, methods and scope of control; dates of its execution 
in accordance with instructions for manufacturing and 
operational control. 
  The monitoring of the metal of equipment and pipelines 
should 
be carried out by relevant NPP services, involving specialized 
organizations if necessary. 
  When design life is over, it is reasonable to start the 
inspection with the equipment of primary circuit, and, if it 
turns out that because of its technical status this expensive 
and labor-consuming equipment cannot guarantee the further 
reliable operation of an NPP, checking the equipment and 
pipelines of the secondary circuit is no longer worthwhile. 
  In the latter case, it may be rational to utilize the site 
cleared out after removal of the obsolete power plant for the 
construction of a new, more powerful and advanced plant. 
  Upon the expiration of design life, the aim of monitoring 
the 
base metal, welded joints, and deposit welds of the equipment 
and pipelines is the evaluation of the status of the metal of 
equipment and pipelines, the detection and recording of metal 
defects, and the evaluation of changes in physical-mechanical 
properties and structure that have been caused by operation 
effects. The control results make it possible to determine the 
possibility and conditions under which the further operation of 
the equipment and pipelines may be permitted. 
  Choosing and substantiating the metal status evaluation 
criteria are among the principal and most complex tasks. It is 
precisely clear-cut criteria for evaluation of the metal status 
that make it possible for the board of technical experts to come 
to a well-grounded decision regarding the cessation of 
operation, the possibility of carrying out heat treatment, the 
replacement of individual equipment elements, or the possibility 
of further operation until the next metal status inspection. 
  The assessment of the metal status with respect to equipment 
wear, change in mechanical properties, and the presence of 
cracks and corrosion and erosion damage has important 
significance for the development of metal status evaluation 
criteria, since, according to domestic research, decontaminating 
media used at the present time allow only five exposures of the 
metal. 
  Long-term successful experience in NPP operation and 
monitoring of the metal of its equipment has shown that the life 
of NPP equipment and pipelines can be extended if the following 
has been detected during post-operation monitoring of the base 
metal quality and welding joints: 

  -  discontinuities detected during visual, penetration, 
magnetic particle, ultrasonic, and other types of monitoring 
that do not exceed the discontinuities allowable by the 
Regulations Regarding the Monitoring of Welded Joints and the 
Base Metal of the Equipment and Pipelines During NPP Operation 
(the following monitoring methods are permitted for use as 
additional methods of monitoring the metal: acoustic emission, 
eddy-current testing, hardness measurement, etc.); 
  -  mechanical properties of the base metal and welded joints 
satisfy either the requirements of the Norms for NPP Equipment 
and Pipeline Strength Calculation or the specifications for 
structural materials; 
  -  actual wall thickness of the elements under pressure stress 
has 
not become less than projected in the detail drawings or 
required on the basis of the results of the strength calculation 
for NPP equipment and pipelines. 

    The evaluation of the serviceability of welded joints and 
base metal for which discontinuities exceeding the values 
allowed by the above-mentioned Regulations of Maintenance have 
been found can be accomplished using the Methods of Calculating 
Allowable Metal Defects of Equipment and Pipelines During NPP 
Operation that has been developed in Russia. 
  It is necessary, in order to predict the life of a reactor 
vessel by the criterion of radiation resistance of the metal of 
active core shells and the weld connecting them, to determine 
the actual fast neutron fluence values along the thickness of 
the reactor vessel and the content of impurities (copper, 
phosphorus) if they have not been indicated in the certificate 
of the reactor vessel. A shift in the critical brittleness 
temperature of the reactor vessel metal is determined on the 
basis of control samples, or if these are lacking, the 
determination of the calculation parameters of irradiation 
embrittlement is made through the coefficients of irradiation 
embrittlement. 
  To predict the life of the reactor vessel, steam generator, 
pressure compensator, and the hydraulic accumulator of the 
emergency core cooling system and the pipelines, it is necessary 
to determine the actual cycling load on the equipment at the end 
of the operating period (number of hydraulic pressure testings, 
startups-shutdowns, pressure retestings, etc.). 
  The results the inspection of the welded joints and the base 
metal, as well as the results of the prognostication of the 
life-expectancy and of change in the properties of the metal, 
are submitted to a board of technical experts (BTE). When 
necessary on the basis of the materials presented, the BTE 
prescribes measures for the restoration of the properties of the 
materials (high-temperature tempering of the metal of the 
reactor vessel in the region of the active core), or reaches a 
decision as to the impossibility of the further operation of the 
equipment and the pipelines. 
  When high-temperature tempering of the metal of the reactor 
vessel in the region of the active core is carried out, the 
degree of restoration of the mechanical properties is determined 
in accordance with the substantiation derived in the process of 
developing the method. Depending on the results of the 
restorative operations, a new lifespan and operating conditions 
of the equipment and the pipelines are designated by decision of 
the BTE, with indication of the limitations (or without 
limitations) on the design life, as are the date and the scope 
of the next inspection of the status of the metal and the welded 
joints, or a conclusion is reached as to the impossibility of 
its [sic] further operation. 
  The development of the Regulations on the procedure for 
setting the periods of further operation of the main equipment 
of units of an NPP that has completed its design life prescribed 
by the technical conditions for delivery, will precludes the 
necessity of drawing up new technical conditions for each type 
of equipment and pipelines at the end of the design service 
life, and will simplify the procedure for the formal 
presentation of the authorization for the extension of the 
service life, while simultaneously ensuring clarity in relation 
to the requirements on the properties of the metal and the 
reliable and safe operation of units of NPP with VVER reactors. 
  Extending the service life of active NPP and increasing the 
design life for nuclear installations to be designed in the 
future must be regarded as one of the promising directions for 
improving the effectiveness of atomic power.

  [Text] Increases in society's demand for transportation 
have always stimulated the search for new transport vehicles and 
technologies. Scientists and designers in various countries 
have, since the beginning of the 1960s, concentrated their 
attention on creating diverse ground contactless (wheel-less) 
transport systems. Since that time, both in our country and 
abroad various types of systems have been developed, theoretical 
research has been conducted, and prototypes and experimental 
full-scale vehicles have been manufactured and tested. Studies 
of technical-economic, energy, and ecological indicators have 
established the superiority of ground transport with magnetic 
suspension, a linear traction electric drive, and an automated 
system to stabilize the vehicle's position in space as it moves 
at speeds up to 500 km/h. 
  The timeliness of the book being reviewed here is dictated 
not only by the tasks entailed in researching and developing 
such transport but also by the prospects of its wide-scale use. 
The book's appearance is tied to the need for advance 
formulation of the theoretical and experimental foundations of 
this direction of transport technology. It analyzes the results 
of R&amp;D conducted in our country and abroad. Its primary 
focus is 
on the developments achieved by a group of higher educational 
institutions and organizations under the direction of the 
All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Electric Locomotive 
Construction [VElNII]. 
  The book is intended for scientific workers involved in 
solving the specified problem but may also be useful to graduate 
students and students enrolled at higher educational 
institutions. Its purpose is to acquaint interested readers with 
the advantages, current status, and prospects of transport with 
magnetic suspension and, above all, with those theoretical and 
experimental foundations of contactless motion that are most 
important and necessary to the study and creation of such 
transport. 
  Chapter one contains general information about ground 
transport for contactless motion. Specifically, it gives a 
classification of levitating transport systems and examines the 
functional and pictorial diagrams and singular features of 
contactless rolling stock with various magnetic suspension 
systems (electromagnetic, electrodynamic, combined, and 
permanent magnet-based suspension systems). It also presents a 
classification of linear traction motors and assesses the effect 
that the type of magnetic suspension system and linear motor 
have on the sphere and efficiency of the use of contactless 
transport. 
  Chapters two, three, and four are devoted to an examination 
of the foundations of the configuration and theory of magnetic 
suspension systems, linear traction motors, and electric drive 
and electric power supply systems. In the second chapter, the 
electromagnetic and mechanical diagrams of a magnetic suspension 
system are analyzed, and a procedure for selecting the type of 
suspension, refining electromagnets' characteristics, 
determining braking and lifting forces during motion, and 
creating automatic suspension control and vibration protection 
systems is set forth. In addition, a comparative analysis of 
combined suspension and traction systems is conducted, an 
electrodynamic suspension system with a complex drive belt is 
examined, and its levitation quality is evaluated. Attention is 
paid to the transitional processes occurring in electrodynamic 
suspension and measures to make the vehicle comfortable. The 
chapter concludes with material regarding the sphere of use of 
permanent magnets for transport suspensions and the design of 
suspension systems based on them. 
  Chapter three examines the singular features of the use of 
linear traction motors and their thermal state and presents a 
comparative analysis of their indicators and ways of improving 
them. Also examined are the operating modes of motors in 
electric drive systems; methods of controlling speed, frequency, 
and voltage; and the singular features of control and power 
supply systems and transformer and cryogenic equipment and its 
effect on the transport's technical and economic indicators and 
characteristics. 
  Chapter five is devoted to the electromechanical 
characteristics of a linear traction electric drive in traction 
and braking modes. 
  Chapter six presents the singular features of the 
aerodynamics and dynamics of the motion of a contactless rolling 
stock. Examined here are disturbing forces as a vehicle moves, 
the principles of its aerodynamics and aeromechanics, and the 
problems involved in selecting the geometric shape of a vehicle 
and its track and assessing the dynamic qualities of vehicles 
with variously designed running gears. 
  Presented in the seventh chapter is a substantiation of the 
technical requirements of both a rolling stock with magnetic 
suspension and its route and track structure, the methodological 
foundations of a technical and economic evaluation of 
contactless ground transport, and a technical and economic 
comparison of its different systems and design versions. 
  The book's limited size prevented its authors from devoting 
more attention to the problems of technical and economic 
comparison of the new type of transport with familiar types of 
passenger transport or to specifying those areas in which its 
use would be feasible. Also not reflected in the book are 
combined magnetic suspension and linear electric drive systems, 
with the exception of systems with linear induction and 
inductor-type synchronous motors that combine the functions of 
suspension and traction. 
  Overall, the book now being reviewed is an original and 
sufficiently complete summary of research on the problems of 
transport with magnetic suspension.

  [Text] The characteristics of a real geophysical medium, 
governed by tectonics (anisotropy, spatial nonuniformity of 
deformation and strength characteristics, as well as stressed 
state, accumulation of irreversible effects of a different 
character on structural dislocations), exert a substantial 
influence on the nature of the mechanical effects of an 
underground nuclear explosion [1, 2, 3]. The position of 
deformations near structural dislocations (zones of reduced 
medium strength) may lead to the appearance of quite large 
relative movements of structural blocks, and accordingly, the 
freeing of stored energy, even in the case of external 
disturbances insignificant in amplitude. The appearance of 
clearly expressed irreversible effects in the medium (ruptures, 
fractures, faults, overthrusts, intensification of relaxation 
processes, etc.) at epicentral distances from the place where 
the underground explosion is set off considerably exceeding the 
extent of the zone of regular failure of the medium [4] (zone of 
local irreversible effects), for example, is noted. 
  The seismic effects of an underground explosion, as the most 
sensitive to a spatial change in medium properties, best reflect 
the influence of its structural-tectonic organization. In 
addition to a sharp change in the amplitude characteristics of 
seismic explosion waves with propagation across large fractures 
and faults [5], an indirect effect of tectonic dislocation as a 
result of freeing of a part of the stored elastic energy, which 
is clearly manifested in a sharp change in the directivity 
pattern of surface and transverse waves [6, 7], has been 
repeatedly noted. 
  In this article a study is made of the influence of the 
structural organization of the geophysical medium on the 
principal effects of an underground nuclear explosion set off on 
8 July 1989 (03[.sup]h[/]46 min 57.64 sec) in the Balapan 
rock mass at the Semipalatinsk test site (coordinates 49Î52 
min 05.7 sec N and 78Î46 min 45 sec E, power q = 35 kt, 
depth 550 m). 
  The rock mass at the place where the explosion was set off 
consisted of volcanogenic-sedimentary and metamorphosed rocks of 
the lower part of the Carboniferous system and 
volcanogenic-metamorphosed and sedimentary rocks of the middle 
part of the Cambrian system, formed in the Hercynian and 
Caledonian folding epochs respectively. 
  Figures 1 and 2 show geologic sections of the rock mass -- 
summary submeridional and more detailed for the shot hole, with 
an indication of the principal types of rocks. The principal 
characteristics of the rocks typical for Balapan are represented 
in Table 1. 
  A number of large and small tectonic dislocations, breaking 
the bedrock basement down into tectonic blocks of different 
order (Fig. 3), were discriminated within the limits of the 
explosion sector. A distinguishing feature of the sector is the 
presence of a large deep first-order tectonic dislocation 
(Kolba-Chingiz regional fault). 
  The Kolba-Chingiz fault separates two very large folded 
systems: Chingiz-Tarbagay meganticlorium formed in the 
Caledonian epoch of tectogenesis and psephytic rocks of the 
Middle Cambrian and the Zaysay meganticlinorium of Hercynian 
age, represented by terrigenous rocks of the Lower 
Carboniferous. Both systems are characterized by an intensive 
superposed folding of different periods and the broad 
development of dislocations of a fault character, predetermining 
the complex block structure of the considered rock mass. The 
average width of the fault zone is about 300 m. The fault zone 
also was traced from the results of magnetic prospecting work 
with a positive anomaly having an intensity up to 800 nTl. 
  Tectonic dislocations of different order and large fractures 
are accompanied by fine tectonic fracturing which is manifested 
in brecciation, schist formation in rocks, presence of 
slickensides and glide striae, noted in a number of control 
holes. The span of the tectonic fractures is 1-5 mm. 
  The discriminated tectonic dislocations are accompanied by 
zones of reduced velocities of propagation of oscillations (Fig. 
1). 
  The Chinrauz and Shagan faults with a fault width of several 
tens of meters with a lower rank are discriminated to the north 
of the Kolba- Chingiz fault within the limits of the Balapan 
test site. Their orientation duplicates the strike of the 
Kolba-Chingiz fault.

  The seismic effect of the explosion was investigated in a 
network of permanent and mobile seismic stations whose location 
in the Semipalatinsk test site region is represented in Fig. 4. 
Some of these stations were located in populated places; the 
others were field stations. The same figure shows the epicenter 
of the explosion of 8 July 1979, regional faults and boundaries 
of the Balapan test site in which borehole shots were set off. 
The epicentral distances to the seismic stations were from 30 to 
200 km.

  1. Registry Method 
  As a rule, in the near seismics zone seismic oscillations 
are 
registered by magnetoelectric SM-3 and VEGIK pendulum 
seismometers with a characteristic period 2 s and an S5S 
seismometer with a characteristic period 5 s and an attenuation 
0.5. The signal from the working winding of the seismic 
detector, proportional to the velocity of ground oscillations, 
goes to the input of the unit for shaping characteristic curves 
having a plateaulike amplitude-frequency curve in the frequency 
band from 0.5 to 20 Hz. Then the signal in analog form is 
registered on magnetic tape using a standard compact cassette. 
The response of such a seismic channel is 10[.sup]4[/] V 
(m/s)[.sup]-1[/]. The dynamic range of the magnetic recorder 
with frequency modulation is 38 db. 
  The registered seismograms are processed using an IN-1200 
specialized computer having an analog input and a package for 
processing the seismograms. The seismogram, reduced to digital 
form, is stored in a winchester or is rewritten on a diskette. A 
considerable number of seismograms was registered on paper using 
light-ray oscillographs with galvanometers operating in an 
aperiodic mode with a high damping factor of about 0.7. The 
galvanometer channel ensured registry of ground displacements 
with a magnification up to 1200 and in the same frequency band 
as the channel for registry of displacement velocity. The 
dynamic range of the channel is approximately 46 db. The maximum 
error in determining the amplitude of ground displacement, 
determined statistically using data from numerous records made 
using several seismometers of the same type at one seismic 
station, does not exceed 6%. Some of the seismograms 
registered 
during the explosion of 8 July 1989 are represented in Fig. 5. 
The three components of ground oscillations were registered at 
most seismic stations: vertical Z, radial horizontal X 
(direction to explosion epicenter) and tangential horizontal Y. 
The seismic detectors were mounted (freely, without attachment) 
on prefabricated concrete pedestals or on bedrock outcrops. 
  Seismic stations (Fig. 4) with the numbers 1-9 were set up 
on 
outcrops of weathered bedrock; the others were set up on 
unconsolidated deposits with a thickness of several tens of 
meters.

  2. General Description of Seismic Oscillations 
  In the near seismics zone the general train of oscillations 
was rather clearly divided into trains of P, S and R waves. The 
periods of oscillations in the Rayleigh wave are greater by a 
factor of 4-10 than in body waves. The maximum amplitude of the 
velocity of oscillations is usually attained in the body waves. 
The maximum amplitude of the displacements, on the other hand, 
was in the surface wave. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-66A>      Fig. 6. </FIG>


  The trains of oscillations have rather many phases, which is 
associated with stratification of the real geophysical medium; 
the influence of the Conrad and Mohorovicic discontinuities 
stands out very clearly. Figure 6 shows experimental traveltime 
curves of different phases of seismic oscillations which can be 
identified with and related to known crustal discontinuities. 
  The P[.sub]1[/] wave is a longitudinal wave refracted in 
the upper crustal layers. It is traced in the first arrivals to 
150 km. Its propagation velocity is from 5.3 to 6.6 km/s. 
  The P[.sub]2[/] wave is a longitudinal wave refracted at 
the Moho at angles greater than the critical angle. Its 
amplitude is greatest at epicentral distances 100-130 km; its 
propagation velocity is from 7.7 to 9.1 km/s. 
  The S[.sub]1[/] and S[.sub]2[/] transverse waves are 
analogues of the P[.sub]1[/] and P[.sub]2[/] waves. The 
propagation velocity of S[.sub]1[/] is about 3.1 km/s and 
that of S[.sub]2[/] is from 3.9 to 5.5 km/s. Beginning at a 
distance of about 100 km the amplitude of the S wave is maximum 
in the group of body waves. 
  The surface wave R is a wave of the Rayleigh type. Its group 
velocity of propagation is 2.75 km/s. It is characterized by 
polarization in the vertical plane. 
  We note that the constructed traveltime curves are virtually 
not dependent on the azimuth relative to the explosion epicenter.

  3. Explosion Energy 
  The seismic network in the test site region was established 
for ensuring seismic safety when setting off underground nuclear 
explosions. In addition, it solves the problem of determining 
explosion energy. The basis of the method for determining the 
power of an underground nuclear explosion at the Semipalatinsk 
test site [17] was the dependence of the maximum displacements 
W[.sub]R[/][.sup]z[/] and W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] in 
the surface Rayleigh wave on explosion energy q and epicentral 
distance R, which is described by the formula: 
  W[.sub]R[/][.sup]z,x[/] = Aq[.sup]0.9[/] 
R[.sup]-1.4[/] mm, 
  where q is the explosion energy, expressed in kt of TNT, R 
is 
the epicentral distance in km. In this dependence A is a 
coefficient dependent on seismic station i, that is, the station 
coefficient. The need for introducing station coefficients is 
illustrated in Fig. 7, where on the rays constructed from the 
azimuths of the seismic stations dots are plotted for the 
amplitudes in the Rayleigh wave for the explosion of 8 July 
1989, reduced using the epicentral distances, that is, the 
W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] R[.sup]1.4[/] values. Thus, the 
attenuation of Rayleigh waves on seismic paths different in 
distance was taken into account. In actuality, Fig. 7 shows the 
surface wave radiation diagram. The circle in the figure was 
constructed with a radius equal to the mean value of the reduced 
amplitude 44.6 mm km[.sup]1.4[/]. However, as indicated by 
Fig. 7, the procedure for reducing amplitudes by distance does 
not transform the Rayleigh wave radiation diagram into an 
azimuthally symmetric diagram; the deviations of the reduced 
amplitudes from the mean attain 100% or more. This scatter 
naturally also persists when computing explosion energy from the 
amplitude of Rayleigh waves if use is made of the dependence 
W(q,R) with the single coefficient A, not dependent on the 
seismic station. (The explosion energy q is virtually 
proportional to the reduced amplitude W[.sub]R[/] 
R[.sup]1.4[/]). 
  The introduction of the station coefficients A considerably 
increases the accuracy in determining explosion energy. The 
station coefficients for the seismic stations at the test site 
were determined empirically and are shown in Fig. 8. Their value 
varies from 3.5 to 12.3. The circle is drawn with a radius equal 
to the mean value of the station coefficients A = 6.4. The 
station coefficients and their weighted values were used in 
computing the explosion energy for the X and Z components of 
displacements in the Rayleigh wave, which was constructed in the 
form of the diagram in Fig. 9 demonstrating the dependence of 
explosion energy on seismic station azimuth. The circle in Fig. 
9 was constructed with a radius equal to the mean explosion 
energy q = 33 kt. The relative error in determining the mean 
power by this method is 6%. 
  The explosion energy, determined from the amplitude of the 
surface waves, is close to the 35 kt which was determined by 
physical methods. The lesser quantity of the mean ``seismic'' 
energy is possibly related to the condition of positioning of 
the explosion hypocenter in the zone of the Kolba-Chingiz fault. 
  The station coefficients take into account both the geologic 
conditions at the registry point and the characteristics of the 
seismic wave propagation path. When the wave propagation path is 
examined, it is found that it is necessary to take into account 
not only the azimuth of wave propagation, but also the place 
where the explosion epicenter is located. For example, it was 
noted in [17] that at the Balapan test site three zones with 
locations of epicenters were discriminated, for which their own 
sets of station coefficients were introduced. And it is 
important to note that the boundaries of these zones coincided 
with the Chinrauz and Shagan tectonic faults which intersect the 
Balapan test site. Thus, it can be assumed that the station 
coefficients also reflect the influence of faults and the block 
structure of the test site on the seismic effect of the 
explosion. 
  The introduction of station coefficients when solving the 
problem of determining explosion energy from surface waves in 
the near seismics zone is similar to the magnitude corrections 
procedure, which is necessary for determining explosion energy 
from the magnitude of body waves at teleseismic distances [18, 
19].

  4. Propagation of Seismic Waves Across Faults 
  Some of the principal factors determining asymmetry of the 
complex radiation diagram of a surface wave (Fig. 7) and the 
values of the station coefficients are the tectonic faults on 
the wave propagation path, which also form that which we have 
called the ``characteristics'' of the path. The experimental 
data registered during the explosion of 8 July 1989 and during a 
number of explosions set off earlier make it possible to 
evaluate the influence of the Chinrauz and Shagan faults, 
located to the north of the epicenter of the explosion of 8 July 
1989. This is traced most simply using the parameters of the 
Rayleigh wave registered on paths intersecting and not 
intersecting these faults. Figure 10 is a diagrammatic map of 
the region on which the epicenters of explosions with the 
numbers 1-6 and seismic stations Nos. 1 and 12, for which the 
seismograms were analyzed, are plotted. The epicenter with the 
No. 1 corresponds to the explosion of 8 July 1992. Figure 10 
shows that epicenters 1-4 are separated from epicenters 5-6 by 
the Chinrauz and Shagan faults. For explosions 5-6 the seismic 
paths at seismic station No. 1 intersect the faults, but for 
explosions 1-4 they do not intersect the faults. With respect to 
seismic station No. 12, the situation is directly the opposite. 
In the remaining details (azimuths of wave propagation, 
epicentral distances, other faults of a lower rank and 
inhomogeneities encountered on the wave path) the seismic paths 
for these explosions are virtually identical. 
  Tables 2 and 3 give the epicentral distances and 
displacements in the Rayleigh wave at seismic stations Nos. 1 
and 12 for six explosions. These data and the power of the 
explosions were used in computing the reduced wave amplitude 
  W[.sup]*[/] = 
W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/]R[.sup]1.4[/]q[.sup]0.9[/], 
  which also is given in the tables (here, as before, 
W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] is expressed in mm, q is in kt of 
TNT and R is in km). The mean reduced amplitude W[.sup]*[/] 
was computed for experiments 1-4 and 5-6. Table 2 shows that for 
explosions 5-6 the amplitudes of the waves at point No. 1 on the 
average is less by a factor of 1.5 than for explosions 1-4. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-68A>      Fig. 10. </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-68B>      Fig. 11. </FIG>


  This difference can be attributed to the attenuating 
influence of the Chinrauz and Shagan faults. 
  A similar result can be seen from the data in Table 3. The 
wave amplitude at station No. 12 for explosions 1-4 on the 
average is less by a factor of 1.6 than for explosions 5-6. It 
is natural to assume that here also the reason was wave 
attenuation during propagation across the Chinrauz and Shagan 
faults. The attenuating influence of the faults is virtually 
identical both for explosions 1-4 and for explosions 5-6, that 
is, is not dependent on the direction of wave propagation across 
the faults. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-005L-69A>      Fig. 12. </FIG>


  The noted effect explains why for the established seismic 
network in the test site region the Balakan test site was 
divided into three zones precisely along the Chinrauz and Shagan 
faults, for each of which their own sets of station coefficients 
were introduced [17] and demonstrates the contribution of these 
two faults to the asymmetry of the experimentally registered 
surface wave radiation pattern. 
  A model of a fault in an ideally elastic medium in the form 
of a plane slot with an elastic filler was examined in [5, 20]. 
According to this model the attenuation of the amplitude of a 
wave propagating across a fault is related to its reflections on 
the interfaces of media with different acoustic hardness. In 
particular, for waves close to harmonic, with a characteristic 
period T and a propagation velocity c with passage across a 
fault of the width L their amplitude decreases by a factor K = 1 
+ g[.sup]2[/] [Note: this term is under a radical sign], 
where the parameter g = „L_g_/cT. Here _g_ = 
_r_c[.sup]2[/]/_r_[.sub]1[/]c[.sub]1[/][.sup]2[/] is 
the ratio of the hardness of the rock mass to the hardness of 
the fault filler, in other words, the fault ``contrast.'' Using 
the experimental data: attenuation of the amplitude of the 
Rayleigh wave K = 1.5, its period T = 1 s, propagation velocity 
c = 2.75 km/s and assuming a common width of the Chinrauz and 
Shagan faults equal to L = 200 m, we obtain their ``contrast'' 
_g_ = 5. A subsequent geophysical investigation of these faults 
makes it possible to obtain reliable information concerning them 
necessary for computing the propagation of seismic waves across 
faults. 
  Among the experimental seismograms shown in Fig. 5 the 
record 
of tangential horizontal oscillations at seismic stations Nos. 9 
and 12 stands out; at these stations the arrival of a transverse 
wave SH, considerable in amplitude, can be seen very distinctly. 
This wave is evidence of the release of tectonic energy during 
an explosion set off on 8 July 1989. Unfortunately, during this 
explosion the tangential component of oscillations was 
registered only at an insignificant number of seismic stations 
and therefore it is impossible to estimate the freed tectonic 
energy using data for close seismics. 
  5. Residual Seismic Effects of Underground Nuclear Explosion 
in Inhomogeneous Medium 
  Aftershocks are some of the most interesting phenomena of a 
seismic character accompanying an underground nuclear explosion 
[8, 9, 10]. The aftershocks associated with relaxation processes 
in the medium are of special interest with respect to 
description of the behavior and properties of the geophysical 
medium, and also in monitoring the conducting of underground 
nuclear explosions [11, 12]. In contrast to the aftershocks 
caused by the collapse of an unvented cavity, the aftershocks 
caused by medium relaxation are characterized for the most part 
by small amplitudes and a short duration [10]. These aftershocks 
are observed over a prolonged period after an explosion, which 
is especially important when organizing the monitoring of 
nuclear explosions (on-the-spot inspection) because the 
monitoring side in this case has adequate time for organizing 
observations in the selected territory.

  The medium relaxation aftershocks accompanying the 
underground nuclear explosion of 8 July 1989 were studied in 
this research. Instrumental observations were made using a 
small-aperture seismic registry network and instrument complexes 
described in detail in [10, 12]. 
  First, for the purpose of obtaining the comparative 
characteristics of pulsed microseismic effects of the wave type 
constantly present in the real geophysical medium, seismic 
registry was carried out for the two weeks preceding the 
explosion. After the underground nuclear explosion was set off 
constant operational seismic observations were made over the 
course of three months. The measurements were made at nighttime 
when the technogenic effects on the geophysical medium were 
minimum. 
  Figure 11 shows characteristic records of a pulsed 
microseismic effect in the medium before the explosion and 
aftershock. A comparison of pulsed effects of natural origin 
(before the explosion) and those initiated by the explosion 
reveals their qualitative similarity, which makes it possible to 
postulate an identity of sources, and accordingly, an identity 
of the mechanisms of radiation of pulsed oscillations. 
  The discrimination of pulsed microseismic signals against a 
background of natural microseismic oscillations was made in an 
automatic mode on the basis of computation and comparison of the 
dispersion relations in narrow and broad time windows, and also 
using frequency selection. The optimum filter was chosen by 
means of spectral-temporal analysis. The method was applied by 
making a moving evaluation of the intensity of seismic 
oscillations in different frequency ranges. In this case the 
useful pulsed signal corresponded to a region of increased 
dispersion values, which determined the frequency range and the 
position of the signal on the time axis (Fig. 12). 
  The range finding (determination of coordinates) of pulsed 
microseismic effects of the wave type was accomplished using one 
of two standard methods: on the basis of a correlation analysis 
of the oscillations registered at spatially separated seismic 
stations and an analysis of the records registered at a central 
three-component registry point and at peripheral 
single-component registry points. 
  An analysis of the seismic records made prior to the 
explosion shows that the number of pulsed microseismic 
oscillations of natural origin distinguishable using the 
employed methods in the explosion region of interest to us [See 
Footnote 1] with a relative radius of 1000 m/kt[.sup]1/3[/] 
[4] did not exceed 1.4 per hour (as an average for the 49 hours 
of registry the relative number of signals was 1.08 1/hour). The 
rms amplitude of the natural signals in the frequency range 5-10 
Hz did not exceed 0.3 Êm/s. The horizontal spatial 
distribution of their foci is virtually uniform (Fig. 13) and 
the depth does not exceed 300 m. One notes the fact that the 
signals characterized by a great amplitude are grouped closer to 
the body of a deep fault.

  In the analysis of the aftershocks of an underground 
explosion only pulsed signals with an amplitude exceeding 0.4 
Êm/s were taken into account. It was assumed that in the 
first 
approximation in this way it is possible to discriminate seismic 
effects initiated by an explosion. 
  Figure 14 shows the intensity distribution of aftershock 
emission with time. The determined dependence N(t), where N is 
the number of aftershocks per unit time, t is time from the 
moment of the explosion, representable in the form: 
  N(t) = 2228t[.sup]-1[/] hour[.sup]-1[/] when 200 &lt; t 
&lt; 2000 hours (1) 
  It must be noted that the experimentally determined 
dependence (1) corresponds to the known temporal distribution of 
aftershocks of natural and technogenic earthquakes (Omori 
frequency of recurrence law [13]). 
  The data represented in Fig. 14 demonstrate the impairment 
of 
the monotonic character of the dependence N(t) on the 18th day 
after the explosion (in Fig. 14 this place is designated by an 
arrow). A more detailed analysis indicated that this can be 
attributed to an anomalous change in atmospheric pressure on 27 
July 1989. As an illustration, Fig. 15 jointly shows a graph of 
the change in atmospheric pressure P in the region where seismic 
observations were made with time and the relative value of the 
deviation _D_N(t) of the number of aftershocks registered per 
unit time from the averaged dependence N(t), designated in Fig. 
14 by a solid line. Figure 15 clearly shows that both 
dependencies _D_N(t) and P(t) correlate well with one another. 
The intensity of aftershock emission drops with an increase in 
atmospheric pressure and clearly increases with its decrease. 
The lag in the _D_N change is about a half- day. The noted 
correlation between relaxation processes and a change in 
atmospheric pressure is consistent with the earlier discovered 
correlation between deformation processes in the geophysical 
medium and atmospheric pressure variations [14]. 
  The law of frequency of recurrence of aftershocks has the 
nature of the Gutenberg-Richter dependence (lgN = 
const[.sub]1[/] - bM, where M is the magnitude of the seismic 
event [15]) and is representable in the form (Fig. 16): 
  lg N = 1.6 - 1.1 lg A, 
  where A is the amplitude of the aftershocks in Êm/s. 
  The value of the b parameter retrieved using the relation 
lgE 
= 11.8 + 1.5M (where E = Const[.sub]2[/]A[.sup]2[/] is the 
energy of a seismic event in erg [16]) in our case is 0.83. 
  The spatial distribution of the foci of aftershocks is of 
fundamental interest with respect to the influence of the 
structural organization of the rock mass on the seismic effects 
of an explosion. As it appears, the presence of a well-developed 
deep fault results in a considerable spatially nonuniform 
distribution of aftershock foci. Figures 17 and 18 show the 
distribution of the foci of aftershocks of the investigated 
explosion in azimuth and depth. It can be seen clearly that the 
overwhelming majority of aftershock foci were concentrated in 
the structural block in which the explosion was set off. A deep 
fault is clearly manifested in the form of some boundary beyond 
which the relaxation processes initiated by an explosion 
transpire considerably less intensively. This means that the 
fault impedes transfer of the energy of the explosion event, as 
a result of which in a structural block separated from the 
explosion first of all there is no additional reserve of elastic 
energy, and second of all, the disturbance from the explosion is 
insufficiently great for initiating the freeing of the tectonic 
energy initially present in the medium.

  [Text] This paper is a survey of the present state of 
research on biological sensors. Enzymatic and immune biosensors 
are described. Problems associated with using microorganisms as 
biosensors are reported in detail. Use of luminescent bacteria 
and luciferase sensors is discussed. The principles of operation 
of fiber-optic and semiconductor biosensors are discussed. 
  Key words: enzymatic and immune biosensors, microbial 
biosensors. 
  New sensitive means of testing with biosensory measuring 
devices--biosensors--are enjoying increasingly wider use in 
clinical biochemistry, microbiology, bioengineering and other 
fields. Sensory systems based on enzymes, cellular organelles, 
cells and tissues of animals and plants, and microorganisms, and 
sensors in which the substance under analysis bonds with a 
target molecule--a receptor, with antibodies, and so on are 
employed extensively in creation of biosensors [18,40,55,56]. 
Physicochemical changes in sensory systems occurring on the 
working surface of biosensors are detected and amplified by 
transducers and registered by the corresponding physical 
methods--potentiometric, optical, acoustic [12,44,63]. The high 
resolution and specificity of biosensors and the speed with 
which measurements are taken with them make them essential in 
monitoring enzymatic processes and in laboratory diagnosis of 
infectious and somatic human diseases. This survey describes the 
current state of efforts to create and use biosensors in foreign 
laboratories and in our laboratories. 
<H5>  Enzymatic Biosensors </H5>
  Sensors in which the sensitive layer contains specific 
enzymes are the most highly developed type of biosensors. The 
first enzymatic biosensor, developed by Clark [23], was intended 
to measure glucose by means of glucose oxidase and an 
O[.sub]2[/]-electrode. The simplicity, reliability and 
swiftness of glucose determination ensured rapid development of 
the new method. Glucose sensors enjoyed wide use in clinics. The 
range of measurements of blood glucose concentrations is 
approximately 2|b10[.sup]-2[/]-5|b10[.sup]-3[/] mg/ml, 
while the time of a single analysis is not more than 15 sec 
[40]. With the advent of implantable glucose sensors connected 
to an arterial or venous shunt, it became possible to measure 
sugar in the blood of a patient directly [13,41,67,75]. The 
importance of such rapid analysis is difficult to overstate in 
relation to diagnosis of sugar diabetes. Sensors for 
subcutaneous measurement of glucose have been created [22]. 
Glucose biosensors are acquiring special importance in the 
development of an artificial pancreas [37]. Glucose sensors are 
being used successfully to monitor fermentation processes [51] 
and in bioengineering [31]. Enzymatic sensors working with other 
carbohydrates (galactose, fructose, xylose, xylulose) make it 
possible to take measurements within a wide range of 
concentrations--from 50 ÊM to 2.0 mM[26,87]. Biosensors have 
been developed to determine a broad spectrum of organic acids: 
pyruvate [73,97], malate [45,101], oxalate [16], glutamate and 
aspartate [100,102], lactate [19,51,73] and ascorbic acid [52]. 
A free fatty acid sensor [75] determines the acid content in 
concentrations of approximately 0.4-2.0 mM in about 10 minutes. 
Enzymatic sensors are widely used to determine amino acids such 
as lysine, methionine, tyrosine [44,95] and aspartic acid [100]. 
Biosensors have been created to determine creatine and 
creatinine in blood plasma and bile [59,68,99]. 
  Enzymatic sensors are widely employed in food industry to 
evaluate the quality and freshness of food products [52,84]. 
Thus, the freshness of fish is determined from the concentration 
of hypoxanthine while that of meat is determined from the 
presence of putrescine and cadaverine [80]. Biosensors are used 
to determine ascorbic acid in fruit juices [52]. A sensor for 
penicillin was obtained with the help of immobilized lactamase 
and penicillinase [21,94]. A biosensor for uric acid is 
sensitive to a substrate concentration of approximately 5 mg/ml 
[62]. Other enzymatic sensors have been developed as well: 
phenol [84], alcohol [94], ammonia [5], a sensor for 
determination of phosphoric acid [91] and others. 
  Fast inactivation of the enzyme, especially when it comes in 
contact with blood and other physiological fluids, is the main 
shortcoming of enzymatic sensors. The life of most implantable 
biosensors is approximately 3-5 hours. The stability of the 
enzyme depends in many ways on its purity and the means of 
immobilization. 
  Enzymes in biosensors are usually immobilized on nylon, 
polyacrylamide, polyvinyl chloride, cellulose acetate and other 
membranes [33,41,49,84]. However, direct attachment of an enzyme 
to an electrode is also possible, which reduces the sensor's 
response time. Stability of enzymatic biosensors is achieved in 
a number of cases by introducing additional enzymes into the 
sensory part of the sensor that break down reaction by-products 
[53]. Development of biosensors led to creation of biosensors 
with different types of electrodes--oxygen [53,75,80,94,97], 
CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode [95], pH-electrode [56,102] and 
others. Biosensors are being developed with immobilized 
cofactors [43], as are multisensors making it possible to 
measure several substances simultaneously [24,62]. New 
directions in designing enzymatic biosensors include use of 
field transistors [10,34] and Langmuir-Blodzhett 
[transliteration] films [86] in them, and creation of 
fiber-optic enzymatic biosensors employing photometric, 
fluorescent and bioluminescent recordings [27,29,87]. Sensors 
working under flow-injection conditions have been created for 
environmental monitoring and to monitor processes in 
microbiological industry and in other fields [51]. 
<H5>  Immune Biosensors </H5>
  Immune biosensors are distinguished by high sensitivity and 
specificity. The sensory part of an immune biosensor is 
represented by antibodies or antigens immobilized on a membrane; 
physicochemical changes in antigen-antibody complex formation 
are registered by the corresponding electrodes. Immunosensors 
are subdivided in relation to the means of detection into 
electrochemical, amperometric, potentiometric and optical 
[15,74], and in relation to the type of immunological reactions 
used--into immunosensors with labeled reagents and without 
labeling. The first immunosensor without a labeling agent was 
created to detect anti-syphilitic antibodies [14], but because 
of the nonspecificity of the cardiolipid antigen the sensor was 
characterized by significant error. A potentiometric 
immunosensor making it possible to detect antibodies to syphilis 
at 800-time dilution of blood serum, and an electrochemical 
immune biosensor for blood group determination were developed 
later [15]. 
  However, immunosensors without a labeling agent have many 
artifacts as a rule, and they require separation of the 
antigen-antibody complex from free substances, which makes their 
use in clinical practice difficult. The sensitivity of 
immunological methods is increased significantly by means of 
labeled immune reagents; free radicals, radioactive isotopes, 
fluorescent dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons and enzymes are used as 
labels. Immune biosensors in which enzymes such as catalase, 
glucose oxidase, _b_-galactosidase, peroxidase etc. have been 
developed to the greatest extent [15,77,78]. Both antibodies and 
antigens are labeled with enzymes [74]. Immune biosensors have 
been created for determination of albumin and immunoglobulins 
within a concentration range of 1-10 Êg/ml [78]. An 
immunosensor for theophylline and gonadotropin can measure 
concentrations of these substances within 
1.1|b10[.sup]-9[/]-2.5|b10[.sup]-8[/] M [77], while the 
detection limit of _a_-fetoprotein is 5|b10[.sup]-11[/] gm/ml 
[15]. Enzymatic immune biosensors with several labeled 
antibodies, which makes them polyfunctional, are being developed. 
  The choice of enzyme for an immune biosensor depends on the 
type of transducer used in the given biosensor, a function that 
can be served both by semiconductors and by electrodes (ion, 
oxygen etc.) [46]. Peroxidase is usually used as the label in 
luminescent immune biosensors. Labeled antibodies are applied to 
a light guide, and change in the sample's luminescence as a 
result of a bonding reaction is registered by a photocell. The 
enzyme luciferase may also be used as a marker in such a system, 
which significantly widens the sensitivity range of the 
biosensor. Use of the electrochemical luminescence of pyrene for 
analysis of blood serum albumin is promising [14]. Optical 
immunosensors in which fluorochromes are used as labels have 
been created on the basis of immunofluorescent analysis; the 
sensitivity of determining proteins in such immune biosensors 
reaches around 1 nM at a measuring time of approximately 5 
minutes [74]. Use of monoclonal antibodies, liposomes and other 
biological materials in fiber-optic immunosensors [1,8,36], and 
the prospects of mass production of immune biosensors for immune 
biosensory diagnosis [1] are discussed in a number of papers. 
<H5>  Cellular Biosensors </H5>
  Biosensors in which the analytical system contains the cells 
of microorganisms, applied to a membrane or to some other 
backing, may be lumped together in the class of microbial 
biosensors. Use of intact cells as a sensor makes it possible to 
determine the substrates and products of any enzymatic reaction 
of a given test object without having to use the complex and 
expensive procedure of enzyme purification, and to detect change 
in cell metabolism in response to mutagens, toxins and 
antibiotics. As with enzymatic sensors, microbial biosensors may 
be classified in relation to type of electrode, means of signal 
registration, class of substances to be determined, and area of 
use. 
  Microbial glucose sensors have enjoyed the widest 
application. An amperometric glucose sensor with 
Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria immobilized in agar 
produces a linear response to glucose in a concentration 
interval of 2.5|b10[.sup]-5[/]-1.5|b10[.sup]-4[/] M, which 
correlates with the enzymatic method of glucose determination 
[93]. The sensor is convenient to analysis of culture media and 
biological fluids. Ascorbic acid is measured by means of an 
O[.sub]2[/]-electrode to the surface of which a 
nitrocellulose filter bearing immobilized Enterobacter 
agglomerans cells is secured [92]. 
  Microbial biosensors are used to measure small 
concentrations 
of amino acids. A sensor consisting of a 
CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode and membranes bearing immobilized 
Escherichia coli bacteria was used to determine 
glutamate. In response to glutamate decarboxylase, the bacteria 
release carbon dioxide, which is measured by an electrode. The 
sensor's selectivity stems from the absence of sensitivity to 
glucose, acetate ions and inorganic ions [39]. L-tryptophan is 
determined by means of a pO[.sub]2[/]-membrane sensor with 
immobilized P. fluorescens cells; in this case the 
response remains linear over an interval of substrate 
concentrations of 4|b10[.sup]-7[/]-7|b10[.sup]-5[/] M 
[93]. An O[.sub]2[/]-electrode bearing chemoautotrophic 
bacteria that consume carbon dioxide on its membrane is used to 
determine L-tyrosine. The sensor's response time is 
approximately 10 minutes, and the response is linear within a 
concentration range of approximately 10-50 ÊM [76]. 
  Microbial biosensors are widely used to measure ethanol in 
fermentation processes using immobilized Trichosporon 
brassicae yeast cells coupled to an 
O[.sub]2[/]-electrode. The sensor reacts selectively to 
ethanol, not reacting to methanol and organic acids. The 
response is linear within a range of 2.0-45.0 mM, and the 
quantity of measurements without loss of activity is 1,200 
analyses [42]. The same sensor is used to measure acetate. A 
sensor for ethanol was also developed on the basis of 
Gluconabacter acetate bacteria membrane-bound with an 
ion-selective field transistor [38]. A microbial biosensor with 
Methylomonas methylovora cells immobilized on a mesh 
electrode or in calcium alginate is also sensitive to ethanol 
[25]. 
  Ammonia monitoring sensors are used in fermentation 
processes. They are based on an oxygen electrode and 
Nitrosomonas sp. cells oxidizing ammonia to nitrite 
ions, and Nitrobacter sp. cells oxidizing nitrites to 
nitrates. The limit of detection of ammonia is approximately 0.1 
mg/liter [39]. An ammonium sensor with nitrifying bacteria 
immobilized on an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode is used to analyze 
sewage, in which the range of ammonium measurements at pH 10 is 
approximately 0.1-1.2 mM [47]. A microbial biosensor with 
immobilized Bacillus subtilis cells was proposed for 
determining ammonium ions [68,71]. The response time of the 
sensor is 5 sec, linearity of the response is ensured within a 
range of approximately 0.0-0.5 mM, the sensor is stable for 
10-12 days, and presence of phosphates, sulfates and chlorides 
does not influence signal magnitude. 
  A sensitive microbial biosensor for determining urea 
consists 
of a CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode connected to a nitrocellulose 
membrane covalently bound with Proteus mirabilis 
cells. The sensor is active for not less than 7 days, and the 
response is linear within a concentration range of 
7|b10[.sup]-4[/]-3|b10[.sup]-2[/] M [35,76]. 
  An amperometric biosensor consisting of an 
O[.sub]2[/]-electrode and Acetobacter pasteurianum 
cells immobilized on a nylon membrane filter is intended for 
determination of lactate in milk and in yogurt. The sensor's 
response is observed to be linear within approximately 
1.0|b10[.sup]-4[/]-13|b10[.sup]-4[/] M, and activity 
persists for around 170 hours [50]. 
  Microbial biosensors can be used in research on the 
physiology of the microorganisms themselves. Thus, an 
O[.sub]2[/]-electrode can be used to determine the 
concentration of the antibiotic gentamicin, which affects the 
duration of the first phase of oxygen absorption by immobilized 
E. coli cells [42]. The action of gentamicin can be 
evaluated and quick control of its activity can be achieved on 
the basis of change in the intensity of metabolism by B. 
pumilis cells (oxygen consumption, change in conductivity 
and dielectric permeability) [4]. Biochemical oxygen consumption 
is one of the criteria of pollution of rivers and water basins 
by industrial wastes and chemicals. Biochemical oxygen 
consumption can be monitored by means of a Clark oxygen sensor 
with microorganisms utilizing organic substrate in aerobic 
conditions immobilized on its membrane. The sensor can be used 
to estimate the concentration of organic matter in liquid wastes 
[69]. A microbial biosensor based on porous membranes bearing 
E. coli, Azotobacter vinelandii and the 
cells of other microorganisms secured to the surface of a 
CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode is used to determine toxicity in 
liquid wastes having a high concentration of organic compounds 
[33,68]. Sensors consisting of Hyphomicrobium sp. 
bacteria combined with a glass electrode are used to analyze 
contamination of industrial wastes by methylsulfates. Its range 
of measurement is 5|b10[.sup]-2[/]-6.3|b10[.sup]-1[/] M, 
the sensor's response time is approximately 5 minutes, and 
stability of work is guaranteed for a week [72]. 
  An amperometric sensor bearing Synechococcus sp. 
cells, which begins to transmit a signal after the photosystem 
of the cells is disturbed, is used to detect chlortoluron, 
linuron and other herbicides [20,84], and it can be used to 
analyze the quality of drinking water. Sensors for mutagens and 
carcinogens were developed on the basis of E. coli, 
Salmonella sp. and B. subtilis 
microorganisms [34,39]. Hybrid biosensors with urease or 
creatine kinase in an ammonia biosensor are used for 
amperometric determination of urea and creatinine. The limits of 
analysis in this case are 5-50 mg/ml for urea and 5-500 mg/ml 
for creatinine [47]. A biosensor for L-tyrosine and maltose was 
developed on the basis of B. subtilis cells. 
  Microbial biosensors based on thermophilic bacteria are a 
new 
type of sensor [39]. 
  Luminescing bacteria and other bioluminescent organisms are 
unique sensory systems. Both native organisms and luciferase 
complexes isolated from them are used for analytical purposes 
[2,5,7,9]. Light luciferase sensors possess high sensitivity and 
low inertia [47]. Microbial bioluminescent sensors containing 
immobilized Beneckea harveyi bacteria can measure 
dissolved oxygen with a sensitivity of approximately 3.5 nM, and 
hydrogen peroxide with a sensitivity of approximately 0.4 ÊM 
[71]. Mycotoxins in food products at concentrations of 
approximately 0.9-20.0 Êg/ml and trace quantities of 
narcotics 
and poisons are determined by means of lyophilized 
Photobacterium phosphoferum cells [7]. 
Photobacterium fischeri strains are sensitive sensors 
of various biologically active substances, including detergents, 
the detection threshold of which is approximately 0.2 mN [2,3]. 
Mutants of photobacteria capable of restoring bioluminescence 
level with the addition of nanogram quantities of different 
mutagens and carcinogens are widely used as indicator systems. 
Ph. fischeri and luminescing genetically engineered 
strains of E. coli (lum), the luciferase system of 
which is more sensitive to a large range of toxins, are being 
used successfully to monitor contamination of the environment by 
toxic substances [3]. Biosensors have been created on the basis 
of bacterial and fire-fly bioluminescence systems for analysis 
of synthetic and natural aldehydes [6,90], dehydrogenases [9], 
proteases and their inhibitors [7], phospholipase [89], ATP 
[29], hormones [47], ethanol [61] and toxins [84]. Microbial 
contamination may be determined by bioluminescent methods with 
an accuracy down to hundreds of cells, which significantly 
raises the level of control. Bacterial luciferase is also used 
as a label [79], being a promising substitute for the RIA [not 
further identified] and other methods [96]. 
  Higher sensitivity to a number of reagents and stability 
under continuous measuring conditions are undisputed advantages 
of microbial biosensors, though they are often inferior in 
selectivity to enzymatic and immune biosensors. 
<H5>  Fiber-Optic and Semiconductor Biosensors </H5>
  Development of biosensors using chemiluminescent systems 
combined with fiber light guides and quantometric methods of 
registering biologically active substances and reactions is a 
new, promising direction in the development of biosensors 
[48,54,70]. 
  Fiber-optic biosensors are unique in the reversibility of 
their indicator systems and in the quickness of the response. 
Specificity is attained by selecting different optically active 
fluorescent or bioluminescent labels [82,83]. The principle of 
operation of a fiber-optic biosensor is as follows: Light from 
the source propagates along the optic fiber to the sensor, which 
is fitted on the end of a light guide, and after reflecting or 
scattering from the sample, it returns to the light receiver, 
which analyzes the responding signal. Reflected light may be 
spectrally altered as it passes through a sample under analysis 
containing an optically active reagent. 
  An optical ``metabolic'' sensor has been proposed--a 
miniature sensitive glucose sensor, the principle of detection 
of which is based on competition between the metabolite to be 
determined and a ligand labeled with fluorescein for a receptor 
binding site [65]. The system uses filters that block scattered 
radiation. The response time in such an optrode is approximately 
10 minutes, and measurement accuracy for glucose is 
approximately 0.13 mg/liter. A fiber-optic biosensor containing 
five sensors was used to investigate the pH gradient in cardiac 
muscle [64]. The measurement technique with this sensor is 
relatively simple and inexpensive, and registration and analysis 
are performed by means of a photomultiplier connected to a 
processor. A fiber-optic biosensor has been proposed for 
measurement of pCO[.sub]2[/] in which a Soverinkhauz 
[transliteration] electrode measures the pH of a bicarbonate 
solution in a container secured to the end of the light guide 
[66]. 
  Another fiber-optic sensor was also developed for 
determination of O[.sub]2[/] using dye phosphorescence [19]. 
The structure of the sensor is similar to the one used to 
measure pH. A powdered dye applied to organic sorbents is placed 
in a porous polypropylene capsule at the end of a light guide. 
Illumination with blue light excites phosphorescence of the dye, 
which emits a green glow with an intensity that is inversely 
proportional to the oxygen pressure. 
  Fluorescing reagents are also used to determine metal ions. 
The concentration of halogen ions and pH in the physiological 
range are determined on the basis of fluorescence extinction 
using indicator systems made from polymer adsorbents [19]. 
Optical gas-discharge sensors based on fluorescence extinction 
of pirenbutyric acid were proposed for determination of oxygen 
[57]. Information was also communicated on an ammonium sensor in 
which the sensor is precipitated onto an optical fiber [58]. 
Fiber-optic biosensors are ideal systems for determining gases 
in biological objects because their response time is short and 
their sensitivity is high (0.017 pH/sec, 0.6 
pO[.sub]2[/]/sec). 
  Fiber-optic biosensors can register not only fluorescence 
and 
chemiluminescence, but also change in the color of the sample in 
question. An optical enzymatic sensor containing alkaline 
phosphatase was used to determine p-nitrophenylphosphatase. 
Change in color of the substrate is registered by a photodiode. 
An enzymatic electrode with a peroxidase photoreceptor secured 
to a silicon surface (or a reaction chain of greater complexity) 
was proposed for quantitative determination of hydrogen 
peroxide, and for analysis of the activity of oxidases and 
products--glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, hypoxanthine etc. 
[60]. 
  Polyenzymatic complexes bound to a permeable membrane at the 
end of an optical light fiber will obviously become the 
principal sensory elements of specific sensors in the future. 
Fiber-optic biosensors are a new resource for obtaining 
biological and chemical information. They are irreplaceable 
wherever it is difficult to obtain such information by other 
means, especially in medicine, where sensory components must 
tolerate sterilization, be biocompatible, and allow precise 
calibration. 
  Semiconductor field transistors are one of the most 
promising 
transducing components for biosensors. Semiconductor sensors are 
divided into three basic classes in accordance with one function 
or another: gas, ionic and biochemical. The last may be 
considered to be semiconductor biosensors because they use 
biological components as sensors--enzymes, antibodies, bacteria, 
tissue cells, various organoids. 
  Beginning with the work of Bergveld [17], who was the first 
to propose using a field transistor to make semiconductor 
biosensors, different variants of such semiconductor structures 
were discussed in the literature [54]. The significant amount of 
attention devoted to such semiconductor biosensors is associated 
with use of integrated technology, which makes it possible to 
reduce the dimensions of sensors and to form different electric 
circuit components on the same chip out of which the biosensor 
is made. The possibility of creating so-called multibiosensors 
and polyfunctional semiconductor biosensors, and organization of 
their mass production are also important. An example of such a 
biosensor would be a multibiosensor based on four field 
transistors, each of which is covered by a membrane bearing the 
corresponding enzyme [48]. It should be noted however that the 
output characteristics of many multibiosensors are nonlinear. 
  Advantages of semiconductor biosensors include a high degree 
of integration, and the possibility for creating polyfunctional 
sensors and using them for continuous monitoring. It is expected 
that biosensors will be used extensively not only in medicine 
and bioengineering [27,28,85] but also in analytical instrument 
making and microelectronics [30,32], as well as in the creation 
of biorobots and biocomputers [88,98]. We can expect that 
biosensors operating on new principles and providing for the 
highest degree of perfection and the highest information level 
in the development of methods for investigating systems will 
soon make their appearance. The prospects of development in this 
direction are obvious.

  [Text] Since the time of publication of Ye. N. Pavlovskiy's 
study [9] regarding the natural nidality of transmissive 
diseases, it has been conventional to classify vectors as 
primary and secondary. No consideration has been given 
heretofore to the mutual influence of vectors on each other and 
on the properties of pathogens that they carry in zones of 
overlapping or noncoincidence of the territories of such 
vectors. Among others, this applies to vectors of the pathogens 
of tick encephalitis (TE) and Lyme disease (borreliosis): ticks 
of the genus Ixodes (I. persulcatus and I. ricinus) of the 
Palaearctic. On European territories there are both zones of 
sympatry of their populations, and zones where circulation of 
each of the aforementioned pathogens is spread by only one 
species of the genus Ixodes, i.e. territories where the 
populations of these species are completely allopatric in virtue 
of the action of abiotic factors. 
  It is taken as established that the most active vector of 
both the aforementioned pathogens on the territory of Russia is 
the taiga tick I. persulcatus [7, 10] with territory totally 
coincident with the region of prevalence of strains of the TE 
virus that are virulent for man. 
  In some areas, e.g. in Moskovskaya Oblast, there are 
territories where populations of I. persulcatus and I. 
ricinus--vectors of borrelias (Borrelia burgdorferi)--are both 
sympatric and allopatric. Studies of 482 ticks of both species 
collected in this region in 1991-1992 have revealed that I. 
persulcatus was infected with borrelias in 28.7 percent of 
cases, and I. ricinus was so infected in 18.5 percent of cases. 
The TE virus was never once isolated in a virusological study of 
the same ticks. To ascertain the role of sympatry in spreading 
circulation of Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks of the species 
Ixodes, all data of occurrence of I. persulcatus and I. ricinus, 
as well as borrelias in them, were plotted on a map of rayons of 
Moskovskaya Oblast. As we can see from Fig. 1, the occurrence of 
I. ricinus is relatively uniform in this region, whereas 
findings of I. persulcatus are confined to its northeastern 
half. It was to this region that nearly all cases of detection 
of borrelias were confined, i.e. almost all of them were in the 
zone of sympatry. All cases of detection of TE, which is spread 
mainly by taiga ticks, are also confined to this region (VI on 
Fig. 1). Taken together, this suggests that not only are cases 
of isolation of pathogens from taiga ticks and people associated 
with the major role of I. persulcatus, but isolation of 
borrelias from I. ricinus sympatric with this tick also depends 
on the presence and behavioral specifics of the primary vector: 
the tick I. persulcatus.

  [Text]Note. Plus--presence of infected ticks; 
plus-minus--presence of both infected and uninfected ticks; 
0--absence of concrrent species; infection of ticks was not 
observed in 1988-1990. 
  In regions where both species of ticks were encountered 
(Fig. 
1), occurrence of the pathogen B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus 
ticks clearly depended on the presence of I. persulcatus on the 
same territories, both uninfected (more precisely not found to 
be infected), and, in particular, infected. As can be seen from 
Table 1, infected I. ricinus are found in zones of sympatry 
8.7-9 times more frequently than where I. ricinus has no 
concurrent species (p &gt;  0.999). Borrelias in I. 
ricinus were isolated from allopatric populations in only one 
out of 12 regions where it is encountered without I. 
persulcatus, namely in the southwestern part of the region. 
Conversely, in regions where I. persulcatus occurs alone, the 
populations of this species of tick were infected with B. 
burgdorferi in 50 percent of cases. The extent of infection of 
I. ricinus in the sole allopatric population was 12.5 percent, 
whereas it exceeds 30 percent in populations that are sympatric 
with the taiga tick. The extent of infection of I. ricinus 
reached a maximum (50 percent) in the most northerly 
rayon--Taldomskiy Rayon (1 on Fig. 1)--where 80 percent of the 
collected ticks were I. persulcatus and the rate of infection of 
the taiga tick is close to maximum (about 40 percent). The rate 
of infection of I. persulcatus is significantly greater than for 
I. ricinus: from 44 to 1014 borrelias in 250 fields of view as 
compared with 1-41 for I. ricinus. Clearly the taiga tick is a 
more active and independent vector of borrelias, and the reason 
that the vector I. ricinus when sympatric with the taiga tick 
becomes a more active carrier, and apparently a vector of 
borreliosis, is that I. persulcatus is present on the same 
territories. Taken together, this suggests that the taiga tick 
is the source of a more acarotropic and virulent pathogen for I. 
ricinus. And this in turn suggests the hypothesis of existence 
of two races, perhaps even subspecies, of borrelias carried by 
different species of ticks: B. burgdorferi persulcati with the 
taiga tick as host, and B. burgdorferi ricini with I. ricinus as 
the vector. And as we can see from Table 1, transfer of the 
former to I. ricinus is more easily accomplished than transfer 
of B. burgdorferi ricini to I. persulcatus. 
  We believe that the transfer mechanism itself is linked to 
changes in the behavior of infected individuals in response to 
markers of the external environment, as occurs with ticks 
infected with the neurotropic virus of TE [1-3], the more so as 
B. burgdorferi is also neurotropic [11]. By using a T-shaped 
olfactometer to separate ticks with respect to behavior in 
response to the scent of poplar, it was established that more 
than half of ticks of both species react positively to the scent 
in cases where borrelias are subsequently found in them. And 
only isolated infected individuals reacted negatively. 
  Positive responses to scent were somewhat more pronounced In 
I. persulcatus, which may be due to their more massive infection 
and the greater effect of the pathogens on their nervous system. 
It cannot be ruled out that more active intermixing of ticks on 
hosts within plant communities in which isolated plants are 
attractants for infected individuals constitutes a basis for 
more active proliferation of borrelias among vectors in their 
zones of sympatry. The epidemiological significance of this 
factor must be taken into consideration, as secondary specific 
vectors in such zones play a much greater role than on 
territories that are only endemic with respect to their own 
species. Such are the patterns of coexistence of vectors in 
zones of permanent sympatry. 
  However, the phenomenon of sympatry may also be temporary in 
cases where man brings in the three-membered parasitic system in 
its entirety into a territory with secondary vector, thereby 
temporarily upsetting the normal existence of allopatric 
populations. The territory of Crimea, where only I. ricinus is 
encountered, was free of TE in consequence of ancient man-made 
transformation of the environment [5]. Favorable conditions were 
maintained by the absence of a virulent pathogen in spite of the 
presence of hosts for ticks, and vectors of the western variety 
of TE: Ixodes ricinus. This was the situation until July of 
1980, when the first patient was reported with antibodies to the 
antigen of the TE virus of the far eastern strain Sofyin 181. 
The antibody to TE of this strain has been identified in birds, 
mouse-like rodents and humans, and the TE virus is from ixodid 
ticks [4]. By the mid eighties, the TE clinic had already noted 
the western variety of the disease. Hence a nidus of TE has 
developed again in Crimea with a strain of the virus of far 
eastern type that is gradually losing its initial highly 
virulent properties, apparently because 34 wild pigs were flown 
in from Primorskiy Kray in 1957 to reestablish the species that 
had disappeared during wartime. The pigs were not exterminated 
and were trapped during the peak of activity of I. persulcatus 
ticks in active nidi of TE. When they were released in a game 
reserve, they created a temporary sympatry of the two Ixodes 
species together with a reservoir of the pathogen. The I. 
persulcatus rapidly perished, having formed an ephemeral 
population for the Crimean climate, and thenceforth the virus 
was circulated by I. ricinus alone, gradually spreading over the 
territory of the mountain forest region of Crimea, losing the 
properties of the highly pathogenic eastern strain of the TE 
virus due to the new vector and milder climatic conditions, but 
remaining antigenically close to the initial far eastern strain. 
Temporary ``hand-made'' has given rise to a stable nidus of TE 
in an allopatric population of vectors of the western variety of 
TE: Ixodes ricinus. 
  The foregoing draws attention to the importance of the 
phenomenon of sympatry (even temporary) of carriers and vectors 
of more virulent strains (races, species) of pathogens with 
vectors that are secondary for operation of nidi of transmissive 
diseases, and assessment of their danger for man.

Moscow State Architectural University: ``A New Seismic Doctrine: 
the Real Danger During Earthquakes Is Not in the Soil 
Vibrations, But Rather, in the Compression Shock Waves''] 
  [Text] According to the current official doctrine, it is 
believed that buildings are destroyed during earthquakes by 
their own vibrations, which are caused by ground vibrations 
which are close to them in frequency. The latter are also 
recorded by seismic instruments. However, the constant and 
completely inexplicable failures in the struggle against seismic 
damage has led to the idea that something here is not as it 
seems and that the seismic engineers are protecting buildings 
not from actual danger, but rather, from a false danger. The 
actual danger, however, has remained unnoticed up till now. 
  This mistake had not been discovered only because, up till 
now, the seismic engineers and seismologists have been the only 
ones concerned with the most complicated problem of seismic 
damage. At the same time, all the prominent specialists in the 
theory of the threshold equilibrium, destruction and durability 
of structures disregarded it. And it never occurred to anyone 
that the patterns of seismic damage are a unique source of 
invaluable scientific information about the true nature of the 
seismic effect on buildings. 
  When I reproduced a series of standard seismic strength 
analyses with due consideration of the ground vibrations 
recorded at the same time, I obtained a paradoxical result. It 
turned out that, in half of the instances, the buildings should 
not have been damaged at all, while, in the rest of the 
instances, the damage should have been completely different. 
Consequently, the results of the currently used standard seismic 
strength analyses do not reflect at all the actual pattern of 
the phenomenon at all. 
  After analyzing the nature, properties and regularities of 
all the seismic damage from the standpoint of structural 
mechanics, I managed to reproduce the mysterious effect which 
caused it. Up till now, this problem had not been solved. It 
turned out that the seismic damage represented the precise 
replication (or impression) of the sought-after effect and it is 
only necessary to know how to interpret it. As a result, I 
managed to discover some very interesting facts which had not 
been known previously and which, however, are of extraordinarily 
important practical value. All the damage during earthquakes 
takes the highly unusual form of a ``clean shear.'' This is 
completely ``abnormal'' for the behavior of reinforced concrete 
columns, partitions and lintels from the point of view of 
structural mechanics. Such damage contradicts the standard 
properties of the flexible components which should always 
fracture and not shear. Moreover, this kind of damage differs in 
its nature from all known types and is not encountered anywhere 
else. So far, it has not been possible to reproduce it 
artificially, even by means of underground explosions. In its 
form, it absolutely does not correspond to and is even at 
variance with the ground vibrations which have been recorded at 
the time of its appearance. Consequently, these vibrations 
cannot cause the actual damage. 
  It follows completely obviously from all these facts that 
the 
main premise in the current seismic ``vibrational'' doctrine is 
false. The true damaging effect which corresponds to the pattern 
of seismic damage may be not the vibrations, but rather, just 
the compression shock waves which are not recorded by current 
instruments. It is precisely these waves which give rise to the 
shear shock waves in the columns and walls of buildings and 
instantaneously shear them. The columns do not even have time to 
bend and the buildings do not have time to sway. This 
automatically means that all the currently used quake-proofing 
measures and designs are absolutely useless. They protect 
buildings from ground vibrations but, in principle, they are not 
capable of protecting them from shear shock waves. 
  For example, we frequently place buildings on flexible 
columns, saving them from resonance vibrations, while, as a 
result of an earthquake, these protective columns simply snap 
like wooden matches and the buildings collapse without even 
having had time to shake. 
  When there are ground vibrations and they cause buildings to 
vibrate, the columns and partitions should fracture on the ends. 
But one of the many seismic paradoxes is the fact that such 
fractures of columns, partitions and lintels do not develop 
during earthquakes. Instead of them, an oblique shear develops 
in the columns (most often in the middle), as if they are being 
cut in two by a giant saber. Inasmuch as there is no fracturing 
of flexible structural elements during earthquakes, this means 
that there are no dangerous ground vibrations there. But then, 
just what kinds of vibrations, in actual fact, are the current 
seismic instruments showing us? The instruments are not 
recording actual ground vibrations at all, but only their own 
vibrations, which have been caused by the shock waves in the 
ground. Up till now, such an interpretation of the accelerometer 
recordings, one disagreeable for the seismic engineers, did not 
occur to anyone. 
  As soon as the seismologists handed over the information 
about seismic ground movements to the builders for their use, 
they immediately also lost the monopoly for the assessment of 
its accuracy. Their mistake ``crossed'' into another's field, 
one not under their control, the field of structural mechanics. 
And this is one of the most experiment-based and precise 
sciences. It possesses a unique ability for determining the 
accuracy of the description of any external effect on a 
structure (including a seismic one). The strength analyzer gives 
it this ability, since it establishes the firm connection 
between the initial effect and the structural damage pattern 
which corresponds to it. If the damage pattern expected by 
analysis does not match the actual pattern, this means that the 
description of the external effect is also invalid. It is 
precisely this result which occurs in all seismic strength 
analyses. 
  So, structural mechanics indisputably establishes the 
erroneousness of the seismologists' information about dangerous 
seismic ground movements. As a result, we have clarified the 
fact that qualitatively different principles, measures and 
designs are needed to protect buildings from shock waves. The 
development and experimental testing of new protective designs 
for buildings of any type and constructional design (both 
planned and already existing ones) have already begun.

  [Abstract] The high antioxidant activity of biological 
liquid in general and human blood plasma in particular due to 
the role of various high- and low-molecular compounds has been 
attributed to the antioxidant protection (AOZ) mechanism of the 
blood plasma which is realized due to its ability to retard 
metal-dependent free-radical reactions involving the development 
of OH[.sup].[/] radicals. Yet speculations that nonenzymatic 
antioxidant protection whose action is directed at lowering the 
active oxygen form (AOF) is active in the blood plasma while 
enzymatic antioxidant protection is triggered under a deep 
oxidative stress where superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the key 
antioxidant protection enzyme prompted the development of a 
method of purifying superoxide dismutase from human blood plasma 
and carrying out a comparative analysis of the purified enzyme 
and Cu- and Zn-superoxide dismutase erythrocytes. To this end, 
superoxide dismutase was measured by Nishikimi's method with 
Fried's modifications, and the superoxide anion radical was 
generated in a system consisting of NADH, phenasinemetasulfate 
(FMF), and tetrazolium nitro blue. The experimental procedure is 
outlined. Superoxide dismutase was isolated by gel filtration on 
AsA-34 and AsA-44 ultrogels made by LKB (Sweden). The protein 
isolated from blood is classified as glycoprotein which is 
thermally stable up to a 75-85Î temperature; its molecular 
mass immediately after filtering was equal to about 147,000 D. A 
comparative analysis of the effect of some compounds capable of 
forming chelate complexes with metals contained in the active 
enzymes on the plasma and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase 
activity shows that the purified enzyme's properties differ from 
those of Cu- and Zn-superoxide dismutase and that the enzyme 
belongs to a new class of extracellular superoxide dismutase 
present in the organism's biological fluids. It is speculated 
that under a marked oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase 
plasma passes to an active state, making it possible to trigger 
the enzymatic protection mechanism and engage them in 
neutralizing active forms of oxygen. Figures 6; tables 3; 
references 32: 9 Russian, 23 Western.

  [Abstract] The unique ability of cyclodextrin 
glycosyl-transferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) to form 
cyclodextrins--carbohydrate macrocyclical compounds--from starch 
and the high commercial and research value of cyclodextrins 
prompted an attempt to produce and characterize antibodies to 
the Bacillus macerans CGTase without known monoclonal 
antibodies to this enzyme. It is noted that poly- and monoclonal 
antibodies to CGTase may be used for detecting small quantities 
of enzyme, even in complex mixtures, and for enzymatic inactive 
studies of the CGTase molecular structure, comparative 
immunology analyses of CGtases of various bacteria species, and 
for specific enzyme immobilization on a solid carrier, making it 
possible to screen a broad range of microorganisms which are 
likely CGTase producers. To this end, a Bacillus 
macerans BKMB-506 strain with the culturing liquid was 
obtained from the national microorganism collection of the 
Microorganism Biochemistry and Physiology Institute at the USSR 
Academy of Sciences. The experimental procedure is outlined. The 
production and cloning of the hybridoma-producing antibodies to 
CGTase, the production of large quantities of MCAs and their 
purification, the production of MCAs conjugated with horse 
radish peroxidase, studies involving indirect, direct, and 
sandwich enzymatic immunoassay analyses (IFA), the 
classification of MCA subtypes, and immunoblotting of the 5B1 
clone (one of 15 positive clones) are described in detail. The 
purified enzyme was used to immunize BALB/c line mice; as a 
result, MCAs and 15 different hybridoma which produce MCAs to 
CGTase are successfully produced for the first time. The MCA and 
polyserum interaction with alkalophilic B. macerans 
CGTase is examined. The MCA to the 5B1 clone recognizes both 
native and denatured B. macerans CGTase forms. 
Moreover, the CGTase dimer molecule has two closely positioned 
epitopes recognized by antigens to the 5B1 clone. Figures 3; 
references 17: 3 Russian, 14 Western.

  [Abstract] Reports that nitrogen substitution with the 
inert and less dense helium lowers resistance and facilitates 
respiratory muscle work and the reverse effect of air 
substitution with an SF[.sub]6[/]-oxygen mixture prompted an 
investigation into the characteristic features of breathing 
control during inhalation of normotoxic helium- and 
SF[.sub]6[/]-oxygen mixtures at rest and during constant 
muscular activity on the basis of analyzing rapid and stable 
changes in the ventilation and biomechanical parameters of the 
respiratory system and the level of the central inspiratory 
activity. To this end, ten healthy 22-42 year old men, trained 
beforehand in order to adapt them to the experimental conditions 
until full stabilization of the indicators under study, were 
examined using He and SF[.sub]6[/] as the diluent gases 
changing the respiratory mixture density at a 20.9+/-0.5% 
oxygen concentration. The SF[.sub]6[/]-O[.sub]2[/] density 
exceeded that of air by 4.21 times and the He-O[.sub]2[/] 
density was less than that of air by 2.94 times. The 
experimental procedure is outlined. The study shows that at rest 
and especially during muscular work, air substitution with the 
He-O[.sub]2[/] mixture suppresses the central inspiratory 
drive, respiratory work, and electric activity of the 
inspiratory muscles while inhalation of the 
SF[.sub]6[/]-O[.sub]2[/] mixture definitely has an 
opposite effect: the effort for developing an level lower 
maximum inspiratory flow at a constant pulmonary ventilation 
(compared to air) and a constant chemoreceptor stimulus rises 
while the central inspiratory activity increases by almost 
threefold. It is speculated that afferent signals from the 
respiratory muscles' mechanoreceptors which maintain the 
necessary alveolar ventilation within a broad range of 
mechanical stress play a crucial role in optimizing the 
ventilation regime in humans in gaseous media with different 
density while the ability to assess the stress imposed on the 
system is maintained even in patients with a traumatic severance 
of the spine in the neck area. Consequently, participation of 
the nonmuscular afferents in the respiration resistance 
perception cannot be completely ruled out, yet an analysis would 
call for a different experiment design and new methodological 
techniques. Figures 4; tables 2; references 33: 8 Russian, 25

  [Abstract] The ability of the delta sleep inducing peptide 
(DSIP) to activate the brain's GABA-ergic inhibitory system 
prompted a study of the effect of the delta sleep inducing 
peptide on various forms of seizure activity characterized by a 
loss of inhibitory control. To this end, the effect of the delta 
sleep inducing peptide on the focal and generalized seizure 
activity and a model of chronically elevated seizure activity, 
i.e., the pharmacological kindling, are investigated. The 
particular problem of examining the effect of the delta sleep 
inducing peptide on the seizure activity when it is injected 
intravenously and determining the delta sleep inducing peptide 
concentration in the central mesencephalon segment which 
includes the reticular section of the substantia 
nigra under the condition of chronic seizure syndrome in 
rats which is formed by pharmacological kindling and is 
characterized by disintegration of endogenous control of brain 
stimulation and spastic readiness is addressed. The experiment 
is carried out on 20 2.2-3.5 kg cats, 280-320 g male Vistar rats 
(with at least ten animals in each group) and 18-24 g 
F-1/CBAXC57B1/6 mice (at least ten). The experimental procedure 
is outlined. The experiment shows that the delta sleep inducing 
peptide is capable of inhibiting the seizure activity in the 
foci created in the cortex of cats by strychnine application, 
developing a delayed seizure kindling syndrome in rats, and 
preventing the development of seizures in mice induced by 
bicucullin, pycrotoxin, and corazol but has no such effect on 
thiosemicarbazide and strychnine. The study reveals that the 
delta sleep inducing peptide's anticonvulsant activity is due to 
its effect on the reticular section of substantia 
nigra whereby the peptide level terminates is that section 
at the late stages of pharmacological kindling. It is speculated 
that this peptide may be one of the factors of endogenous 
control of the brain excitability. The findings demonstrate that 
the peptide and the preparations on its basis may be useful in 
developing new methods of cupping off and preventing the 
convulsion syndrome. Figures 2; tables 1; references 23: 7

  [Abstract] The ion exchange process occurring by means of 
ion channels in the cell membrane and the recently discovered 
ion channels in viral protein shells (capsides) which consist of 
base structural building blocks referred to as protomers linked 
by polypeptide chains are discussed, and it is speculated that 
chemical substances with the specific effect of blocking the 
viral or bacterial ion channel can be found. Such mechanism, if 
found, could make it easier to identify viral infection 
protection mechanisms. A mathematical model developed for 
designing substances with the desired ion channel blocking 
property which makes it possible to examine how some ions or 
molecules affect the state of ion channels is proposed assuming 
that the kinetic energy of the transported ions can be ignored. 
The underlying principles and realization of the mathematical 
model as well as its applications to the South American bean 
mosaic virus for Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] ions are 
described in detail. The Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] 
ion trajectory inside the ion channel and the electric potential 
magnitude at the Ca[.sup]2+[/] and Li[.sup]+[/] ion 
trajectory points are plotted. The findings show that a 
potential barrier arises in the path of the calcium ion but does 
not in the case of the lithium ion, which is consistent with 
Silva, Cacheau, et al. Figures 2; references: 12

  [Abstract] The issue of comparing homologic protein 
molecules in order to construct a philogenetic tree and the 
shortcomings of the methods used for this purpose are outlined, 
and known attempts to define and measure the distances for each 
pair of amino acid sequences of the proteins under study are 
reviewed. The outcome of computer methods of comparing the 
proteins under study on the basis of the pairwise distance are 
used to classify proteins by their main function, identify new 
proteins, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of the 
proteins under comparison in the form of philogenetic trees 
using any existing algorithm. For illustration, sea anemone 
toxins are compared to other toxins separated from the snake 
venom and equine, duck, rat, and human proinsulins. Based on the 
maximum total scores, Radianthus macrodactylus toxins 
are closest to long neurotoxins whose classification scoring 
points are analyzed on the basis of the pattern recognition 
theory. Pair Euclidean distances for 22 proteins from four 
groups, the concentration of informative amino acid residues and 
classification scores for snake toxins, and a comparison of 
Radianthus macrodactylus toxins RTX-I and RTX-V to 
snake neurotoxins and cytotoxins are summarized in a tabular 
form. The sample of ten A2 phospholipases is divided into two 
groups according to the organisms they represent using the newly 
introduced distance. An original application software package 
developed by the authors for comparing the proteins by their 
amino acid composition is described. It is available for 
purchase from the developers. Tables 3; references 14: 10

  [Abstract] The phenomenon of joint localization of 
classical and peptide neurotransmitters which enables the 
receptor to interact with its own specific ligand and ligands 
which are specific to other receptors--which may lead to a 
modulating effect on the receptor activity--and the recently 
discovered effect of substance P (SP) on the binding 
characteristics and functional properties of the nicotine acetyl 
choline receptor (AKhR) prompted an examination of the effect of 
various acetyl choline receptor ligands on the binding of 
iodized substance P to tachykinin receptors (TKhR) in the rat 
brain. The study shows that such compounds as 
d-tubocurarine and phencyclidine inhibit the SP 
binding but only at sufficiently high concentrations 
(10[.sup]-4[/] M). Thus, ion exchange HPLC is used to purify 
_a_-neurotoxins, _k_-bungarotoxins, cytotoxins, and 
A[.sub]2[/] phospholipases of snake venom. Phospholipases 
A[.sub]2[/] have the highest ability to inhibit the substance 
P binding by the rat brain membrane while the remaining toxins 
are weak inhibitors. The high inhibitory potential of 
_a_-bungarotoxin discovered earlier is attributed to 
contamination of commercial preparations with phospholipase 
A[.sub]2[/]. The high sensitivity of the SP interaction with 
tachykinin receptors to phospholipases A[.sub]2[/] is 
especially noteworthy due to the fact that various 
phospholipases A[.sub]2[/], including brain enzymes, are 
activated by a number of G-proteins connected to 
G-protein-dependent receptors. It is speculated that cell 
phospholipases are capable of specifically interacting with 
Na[.sup]+[/]- and K[.sup]+[/]-ATPase or annular lipids and 
serve as an endogenic regulator. Figures 2; tables 1; references

  [Abstract] The use of oligonucleotide receptors containing 
alkylating groups in their structure for sequence-specific 
nucleic acid modification, usually attached to the terminal 
phosphate or 2',3'-cis-diol group and the use of oligonucleotide 
derivatives with modifying groups attached to the heterocyclic 
base (which may be spatially close to the nucleic acid target) 
are discussed, synthesis of 
4-(N-methyl-N-2-chlorethylamino)benzyl heptanucleotides 
derivatives is described for the first time, and their affine 
modification of pentadecanucleotide is investigated. The 
heptanucleotides containing an aliphatic amino group at the 
5'-terminal attached in the desoxyuridine 5-position through 
L-spacers of various length were synthesized according to 
Zarytova, Komarova, et al. The phase conjugation 
chromatography (OFKh) pattern of the reaction products after the 
derivative synthesis and an electrophoresis pattern of the 
target alkylation products are plotted. The 
4-(N-methyl-N-2-chlorethylamino)benzyl radical (RCl) was added 
with the help of a derivative benzaldehyde reaction with the 
heptanucleotide amino group. A new type of alkylating 
derivatives of oligonucleotides which carry the RCl group in the 
C-5 desoxyuridine radical and ensure a high degree of DNA target 
modification is produced. U[.sup]LNHRCl[/]CCACTT reagents 
(L is -CH[.sub]2[/]-, 
-CH[.sub]2[/]OCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-, or 
-CH[.sub]2[/]NHCOCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-) are 
synthesized and then used to modify the target with an 
80-90% 
effectiveness. The findings show that the third reagent with the 
L=-CH[.sub]2[/]NHCOCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-spacer 
ensures an almost quantitative modification of the target at one 
particular point which is usually not observed for 
oligonucleotide derivatives with the RCl radical attached to the 
terminal phosphate of ribose's 2',3'-cis-diol group. Figures 3;

  [Abstract] The powerful general immunostimulating activity 
of thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/]--one of more than 30 peptides with 
a low molecular mass of 1,000 to 15,000 isolated from the 
thymus--which is synthesized in the body in the form of a 
precursor from which it is cleaved off prior to N-terminal 
acetylation, and the shortcomings of known thymosin 
_a_[.sub]1[/] synthesis gave an impetus to designing a hybrid 
gene using a carrier which encodes a small-sized protein which 
does not contain methionine residues and is easily expressed in 
bacterial cells. Chemical enzymatic synthesis and cloning of an 
artificial gene in E. coli which encodes the 
immunoactive peptide thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/] is reported. The 
semisynthetic gene of the mutant human tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) in the pTNF3314 plasmid used earlier to construct hybrids 
with antigen determinants of the foot and mouth disease virus 
which contains a unique BamHI restrictase site in the 
C-terminal part meets all of the necessary requirements. A 
preliminary investigation of the biological properties of 
recombinant fusion proteins shows that the Thy-TNF fusion 
protein is characterized by complete biological activity of the 
tumor necrosis factor in a cytotoxicity test on transformed 
fibroblasts of L-929 mice while the TNF-Thy fusion protein is 
considerably less active. The findings confirm the earlier 
conclusions about the important role played by the C-terminal 
TNF segment in the biological (cytotoxic) activity 
manifestation. Thus, artificial genes which encode the TNF and 
thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/] hybrids are constructed, and their 
expression in E. coli and the properties of the 
proteins encoded by them are examined. The cytotoxicity of the 
fusion proteins is determined according to Meager, Leung, 
et al. The authors are grateful to V.Ye. Zhemchugov, 
O.A. Kaurov, A.A. Kolobov, and V.A. Kulikov for proving 
assistance and supplying the serum. Figures 7; references 26: 6

  [Abstract] The role of human interleukin-4 as a growth and 
immune system cell differentiation stimulant which regulates the 
immune response and the difficulty of obtaining large quantities 
of interleukine-4 necessary for in depth studies and practical 
applications from natural sources make the use of genetic 
engineering and biotechnology methods especially promising. 
Chemical enzymatic synthesis of the human hIL4 gene at the 
Bioorganic Chemistry Institute lab is reported and this gene's 
expression in E. coli cells is described. The 
pKK223-3 commercial plasmid (by Pharmacia) containing a strong 
controlled tac-promotor, a binding segment with 
ribosomes of the lacZ gene, EcoRI-HindIII 
polylinker of the pUC18 plasmid, and a strong transcription 
terminator of the rrnB gene is used as the expression 
vector while the EcoRI-HindIII fragment 
containing the hIL4 gene is cloned into the pKKhIL4-12 
polylinker segment. The factors which affect the gene expression 
are examined, and it is noted that the expression level depends 
on the distance between the ribosome binding segment (RBS) and 
the starting ATG codon. The resulting TG1/pKKhIL4-9 strain was 
used to isolate hIL4 which is produced in the E. coli 
bacterial cells in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. The 
highest production level is observed in the structure where the 
RBS distance corresponds to nine nucleotide pairs. The hIL4 was 
solubilized, renatured, and purified in a biologically active 
state with a yield of 2 mg per 1 g of moist cells. According to 
amino acid sequencing data, the resulting hIL4 has an N-terminal 
Met-His-Lys-Asp-He-Thr-Leu sequence which is consistent with the 
human interleukin-4 sequence with an additional Met. Figures 8; 
tables 1; references 14: 2 Russian, 12 Western.

  [Abstract] Substance P (SP) and kindred peptides which form 
a family of the so-called tachykinins or neuroquinines and 
possess a broad range of biological activity, e.g., affect of 
the nonstriated muscle contractility, play the role 
neuromediators, participate in transmitting pain signals, and 
affect the level of classical neuromediators and cytokins, are 
discussed, and the need to clarify the structural-functional 
relationships of tachykinin receptors is emphasized. To this 
end, an attempt is made to establish the structure of the 
maximum possible number of proteins in this family, including 
human receptors. The emergence of the polymerase chain reaction 
method (PTsR or in vitro amplification) facilitates 
identification and makes it easier to establish the structure of 
genes belonging to one family. Success in isolating a kDNA human 
fragment with the help of polymerase chain reaction and primers 
synthesized on the basis of the NK-2 receptor gene nucleotide 
sequence from the bull intestine in using a human trachea mDNA 
is reported, and polymerase chain reaction is used to identify 
the substance P receptor gene (NK-1 receptor) in the human 
genome. Primer pairs whose nucleotide sequences are identical to 
conservative segments of DNA receptor areas of the rat brain 
substance P are synthesized, and the resulting polymerase chain 
reaction products are analyzed using electrophoresis. The 
resulting fragment is identical to the 771-864 fragment of the 
nucleotide sequence of the rat brain substance P receptor except 
for the G[.sup]796[/]A substitution, i.e., a ValIle 
substitution in the amino acid sequence. A comparison to 
published sources reveals that the established nucleotide 
sequence corresponds to tachykinin receptors and is a fragment 
of the substance P receptor gene. The authors are grateful to 
N.S. Bystrov for oligonucleotide probe synthesis. Figures 2; 
references: 11 Western.

  [Abstract] The development of synthesis of 
oligodesoxyribonucleotides containing 
5-fluoro-2'-desoxyribocytidine (fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd) which are a 
promising source for understandding mechanism of cytosine 
DNA-methylases is described in detail. The resistance of 
5'-O,N-protected fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd under the conditions of 
standard postsynthesis oligonucleotide treatment is examined, 
and it is shown that exposure of such protected 
fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd to concentrated ammonia at 55ÎC for 18 h 
with subsequent exposure to an 80% aqueous solution of 
acetic 
acid at 20ÎC for 40 min removes the protective groups 
without altering the fluoridated nucleoside structure. It is 
speculated that the absence of benzoyl amino group protection 
makes the nucleoside more stable to subsequent acid treatment. 
The findings show that oligonucleotides containing 
fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd in the middle of the chain can be produced 
rather simply and effectively by a combination of chemical and 
enzymatic synthesis; this method can be used for producing 
oligonucleotides not only with a single fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd 
radical inclusion but also with several fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd 
radicals spaced from each other by six-to-seven nucleotide links 
by ligating several oligonucleotides with 5'-terminal 
fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd. The authors are grateful to V.N. Sergeyev, 
V.N. Tashlitskiy, and G.Ya. Sheflyan for help with isolating and 
analyzing oligonucleotides. Figures 1; references 11: 2 Russian,

  [Abstract] The potential of using Radianthus 
macrodactylus sea anemones as a source of physiologically 
active substances and the failure to isolate neurotoxins with a 
nonprotein origin from Radianthus macrodactylus sea 
anemones prompted attempts to isolate highly active nonprotein 
toxins from tropical sea anemones. The toxin was isolated by 
chromatography on polytetraflourethylene, CM-sephadex C-25, and 
HPLC ion exchangers in Ultropac TSK CM-3SW and Ultropac TSK 
DEAE-3SW columns. This toxin was firmly sorbed by the 
hydrophobic agent Polychrome-I and interacted weakly with 
cation- and anion-exchange substances at a pH of 5.0 and 7.4, 
respectively. The toxin's nonprotein origin was confirmed by the 
negative outcome of a test for N-terminal amino acid and amino 
acid analysis. It is shown that the palytoxin molecule's 
trans-3-aminoacrylamide fragment which is responsible 
for the 263 nm peak in the ultraviolet spectrum is unstable both 
in acidic and alkaline media. For intravenous injection in mice, 
the toxin's LD[.sub]50[/] is 74+/-0.29 Êg/kg. It is 
speculated on the basis of the substance's high toxicity as well 
as spectroscopy data that it is the same palytoxin which was 
isolated for the first time from Palythoa toxica 
zoanthid. The authors are grateful to T. Balashova and A.I. 
Kalinovskiy for recording the 500 MHz NMR spectra and discussing 
the spectrum patterns. References: 7 Western.

  [Abstract] The use of phosphamide nucleopeptides for 
simulating the protein-nucleic structure bonds and the use of 
oligonucleopeptides (the prefix ``desoxy-'' is omitted in the 
oligonucleopeptide (ONP) designation) as chemical probes, 
markers, and affine agents prompted a search for highly 
efficient and specific selective reagents for their synthesis. 
In the authors' opinion, the redox condensing agent--a mixture 
of triphenylphosphine (Ph[.sub]s[/]P) and 
2,2'-dipyridylsulfide (Py[.sub]2[/]S[.sub]2[/])--which was 
used for making oligonucleopeptide phosphamines meets these 
requirements. An attempt is made to analyze the course of the 
reaction and the formation of byproducts as well as outline the 
bounds of redox condensing reagent (AVKR) applications for 
producing oligonucleotidyl-(PN)-peptides. The source 
materials and synthesis procedure in the presence of various 
nucleophilic catalysts are discussed in detail. The study shows 
that the reaction is especially sensitive to strong bases and 
terminates in the their presence by forming a symmetric 
pyrophosphate. The use of the redox condensing agent without the 
catalyst makes it possible easily to phosphorylate the weak-base 
amines while the catalyst retards the reaction with them and 
facilitates it with more basic amines. The best results are 
obtained with peptides whose pKaÛ9. The findings confirm that 
synthesis occurs with the formation of a phosphamide bond both 
in the 3' and 5' oligonucleotide position. Both nucleophilic 
catalysts and the basic properties of peptide amino groups as 
well as the end phosphate position directly affect the course of 
the reaction and the oligonucleopeptide and byproduct formation.

  [Abstract] The environmental and economic tasks of 
industrial enterprise waste water treatment with the help of 
various microorganism strains and the urgency of finding 
off-chromosomal genetic determinants of the biological 
degradation process prompted the screening of plasmid DNA in the 
strains separated from industrial enterprise waste water. To 
this end, Ps. putida, Ps. alcaligenes, B. subtilis 
strains from the collection of the Voodoobrabotka Research 
center are used. The microorganisms were grown a salt medium. 
The study demonstrates that the strains capable of utilizing 
surface active substances contain plasmid DNA yet with respect 
to urea, this property does not correlate with the presence of 
plasmids. It is speculated that it is coded by chromosomal 
genes. The findings open the possibility of developing vector 
molecules for B. subtilis on the basis of the pMA9 
and pMA10 plasmid genomes. A comparison to published data makes 
it possible to note that plasmids DNA participating in the 
biodegradation of ampholytic surfactants are detected in a 
number of Ps. putida strains. The importance of 
separating the direct genes which determine biodegradation of 
syntanol is stressed. Figures 1; references 3: 2 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] Interest in biochemical and electric responses 
of the nerve cell to application of antibrain antibodies is 
attributed to the fact that such reactions serve as the 
biological basis of nervous and psychological disorders, and 
data on the intracellular mechanisms of the nerve cell's 
electric activity behavior under the effect of antibrain 
antibodies are reviewed. In particular, the electrophysiological 
effects of immunoglobulines (Ig) and blood serum of 
schizophrenia patients, electrophysiological effects of 
antibodies to S-100 proteins, i.e., AS-100 or genus-nonspecific 
proteins present in the glia or neurons both in the soluble and 
membrane-bound form, and the role of intracellular mediators in 
AS-100's electrophysiological effects are examined in detail. A 
study involving snail and rat hippocampal neurons shows that 
these antibodies suppress the action potential generation with 
or without the membrane depolarization, decrease the membrane's 
input resistance, and lower the amplitude of stimulating 
postsynaptic potentials. AS-100 lowers the potential-dependent 
inward current and induces steady-state inward current, yet 
these phenomena can be neutralized fully or partially by 
intracellular EGTA Ca[.sup]2+[/]-chelator or cAMP injection. 
Under the effect of antibrain antibodies on the nerve cell, 
events develop in its cytoplasma which are similar to those 
occurring in the cytoplasma of immunocompetent cells during the 
antigen-antibody complex formation in them. It is speculated 
that AS-100's electrophysiological effect is due to an increase 
in the Ca[.sup]2+[/] level and a decrease in the cAMP level 
in the nerve cell's cytoplasma. It is further speculated that 
these antibodies are also capable of inducing similar effects in 
human brain neurons and leading to significant shifts in the 
psychic status. Figures 1; references 35: 14 Russian, 21 Western.

  [Abstract] The marked protective action of the I-fraction, 
also referred to as FI-antigen, to the plague microbe is well 
known; atypical forms of the Yersinia pestis agent 
which do not synthesize the I-fraction and are found in natural 
foci can usually be produced from preparations on the basis of 
antibodies to the mice toxin or T-antigen. Consequently, an 
attempt is made to construct special producer strains of FI- and 
T-antigen to the plague microbe using genetic engineering 
methods. To this end, pFra/Tox plasmid DNA are isolated from the 
monoplasmid version of the K-I vaccine strain of Y. 
pestis, and cloning is performed in the cells of strain 803 
of Escherichia coli using the pBR328 vector and cos36 
(rep R1162) cosmids and a restrictase and DNA ligase set. The 
experimental procedure is outlined. The protective action of the 
purified preparations of the FI-antigen produced from 
recombinant strain cultures is assessed using conventional 
techniques, and statistical data processing is carried out 
according to Ashmarin and Vorobyev. The mice toxin gene is 
cloned on the pBR328 vector in the HindIII-fragment (6.0 MD) of 
the pFra/Tox plasmid. An in vitro deletion 
mutagenesis analysis shows that the sequence encoding the mice 
toxin has two Bg1 II sites and one Eco RI site. Hybrid pKT328 
plasmid is considerably more stable compared to the pBR328 
vector. A restriction chart of the 30.3 kD long pFra/Tox genome 
area which houses the fra and tox genes is plotted, and it is 
established on the basis of the diffusion precipitation reaction 
in agar that the recombinant E. coli strain cells 
produce no more than two units of T-antigen (mice toxin). The 
area responsible for the incompatibility of the pFra/Tox plasmid 
and correct distribution of its copies among the daughter cells 
is identified. The results make it possible to state that by 
increasing the gene dose and expression level of the cloned 
gene, FI- and T-antigen producing strains which are 
distinguished by a stably high synthesis level and the absence 
of a number of contaminating antigens have been constructed. The 
recombinant strain cells produced from Y. pestis EV 
(3P[.sup]-[/]) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis PI 
produce four-to-eight times more FI-antigen than the cells of 
the NIIEG line, while purified FI-antigen preparations produced 
from the recombinant strains' cultured liquid (KZh) have at 
least as high a protective ability as the preparation isolated 
from NIEEG strains. Figures 3; tables 4; references 16: 12

  [Abstract] The urgency of measuring the lysine 
concentration in commercial production and clinical analyses and 
the complexity of existing enzyme immobilization methods 
necessitated the development of a simple method of immobilizing 
the enzyme on a cellulose membrane in order to detect lysine 
with the help of a conductometric pCO[.sub]2[/] electrode. To 
this end, L-lysine decarboxylase (UII type from E. 
coli) made by Sigma (U.S.) and Vladipor No. 1 cellulose 
membranes are used. The enzyme electrode preparation method and 
a block diagram of the L-lysine concentration measurement 
circuit are cited, and the dependence of the L-lysine sensor 
activity on pH and the effect of the measurement temperature on 
the lysine sensor sensitivity are plotted. The enzyme optimum 
operating conditions fall within pH=5.5-6.0; a decrease in pH 
increases the biosensor sensitivity, but lower pH values inhibit 
the enzymatic activity. The optimum operating temperature is 
37Î. The sensor is characterized by a linear response within 
a 0.4-8 mM concentration range. In addition to lysine detection, 
the proposed sensor may be used for other chemicals, e.g., 
chlorophos. Figures 3; references 6: 2 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Abstract] The limitation on the practical implementation 
of saccharose inversion by the Zymomonas mobilis 
culture in order to obtain such valuable products as fructose, 
glucose, alcohol, etc., and the urgency of developing ``soft'' 
micro-organism cell immobilization methods without lowering the 
cells' functional activity necessitated an attempt to increase 
the stability of the biocatalytic system by treating hydrogel 
particles on the basis of calcium alginate with Zymomonas 
mobilis cells immobilized in them by solutions of cationic 
polyelectrolytes capable of cooperatively forming 
interpolyelectrolyte complexes with polyanions. The 
Zymomonas mobilis 113 cell culture was grown for this 
purpose for 24 h in an aqueous nutrient medium. The experimental 
procedure and hydrogel production method are outlined. A 
schematic diagram of the immobilizing unit is cited, and the 
saccharose inversion degree is summarized. In particular, the 
effect of the aqueous poly-N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'diallylammonium 
chloride (PDMDAAC) solution in the Zymomonas mobilis 
cell viability and the effect of the Zymomonas 
mobilis culture concentration in the biocatalyst on the 
catalytic activity of the system within a 2-16% cell 
concentration range are examined. The findings show that 
treatment of calcium alginate hydrogel with immobilized 
Zymomonas mobilis 113 cells by an aqueous solution of 
the PDMDAAC cation polyelectrolyte results in the 
polyelectrolyte complex film (PEK) development on the gel 
particle surface; the film is polymer cation and anion complex 
insoluble in water. The polyelectrolyte complex film has the 
properties of a membrane, i.e., is permeable to low-molecular 
compounds such as saccharose and monosaccharide. The 
polyelectrolyte complex film membrane also prevents the 
immobilized cell release to the external solution, thus greatly 
increasing the biocatalytic system stability. Diffusion of 
saccharose and the reaction products inside the polymer matrix 
is the limiting stage of the saccharose inversion by the 
immobilized cells into the modified polyalginate hydrogel 
matrix. Figures 6; tables 1; references 6: 3 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] The shortcomings of long-range forecasting of 
biotechnology productions, particularly the formulation of 
specific trends of systemic development concepts, and the 
negative impact of the ``corrective response'' management 
practices prompted the development of a new approach based on a 
systemic representation of the prototype plant as an organically 
integral complex containing the hypothetical image of the 
biopreparation (BP) and the methods of its development and 
production. To this end, existing predicted entity 
classification approaches and forecasting methods are analyzed. 
A block diagram of step-by-step morphological analysis and a 
block diagram of the initial morphological culturing version 
matrix are cited, and the outcome of the culturing method 
assessment by the expediency criterion is summarized. The above 
step-by-step prediction procedure is suggested for use on the 
basis of morphological analysis and a group of expert methods; 
the procedure is tested in forming the predictive image of new 
biotechnology plants for producing viral preparations on the 
basis of animal cell cultures. The optimum version selection and 
rejection of dead-end versions are performed in three 
iterations. In particular, perfusion culturing in a membrane 
biological reactor or a reactors with packed macrocarrier 
spheres are suggested. Figures 2; tables 1; references 20: 14

  [Abstract] A 14.8 kbp chromosomal DNA fragment, designated 
T16, was cloned from Yersinia pestis TWJ and a 
restriction map made of the fragment. T16 was tested with 
subfragments in dot hybridization with Y. pestis, Y. 
pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica, as 
well as with enterobacteria such as shigella, salmonella, and 
various strains of intestinal bacilli. The fragment was used to 
construct a 980 bp DNA probe species-specific for Y. 
pestis. In a number of strains of the pseudotuberculosis 
microbe, the researchers found nucleotide sequences with a 
relative homology for Y. pestis. The restriction map 
indicates the absence of the EcoRI site of the CM fragment in 
the T16 sequence, suggesting either that the authors cloned DNA 
fragments similar to those cloned by Bardarov et al. (FEMS 
Microbiol. Lett., 1990, Vol.71, pp 277-280) or that there are 
structural differences in that region of DNA in the strains 
Y. pestis TWJ and EV. A nucleotide repeater was, 
indeed, found. Figures 2, references 15: 7 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Abstract] The rapidly deteriorating environmental 
conditions increase the urgency of research into the genetics of 
nitrogen fixing microorganisms, both free living and 
endorhizospheric, which are capable of 1) cloning the plant 
vessel bundles, making them exceptionally competitive with 
respect to the soil microflora, and 2) producing a natural plant 
growth stimulant, i.e., indolyl-3-acetic acid. The resulting 
attempts to clone pZE8 natural hsd plasmid replicon-based 
cloning vectors for Escherichia coli and 
endorhizosphere nitrogen fixer Klebsiella oxytoca 
VN13 are outlined. The source materials and cloning procedure 
are described in detail. The pKAS18 and pKAS19B vectors 
constructed on the basis of the replicon of the natural hsd 
Citrobacter freundii plasmid and the pUC18 and pUC19 
polylinkers have a selective stability marker for kanamycine; 
tests show that that 96% Cm[.sup]R[/] and 98% 
Tc[.sup]R[/] of the resulting clones are stable to this 
antibiotic. The pMG1k and pMG21k plasmids are shown to be 
suitable fore cloning PstI DNA fragments, e.g., developing 
genome libraries of microorganisms; moreover, the pMG21k plasmid 
has unique restriction sites SmaI/XmaI in the Km[.sup]r[/] 
gene an Sall and EcoRV in the Tc[.sup]r[/] gene. The latter 
sites may be used for cloning employing direct recombinant 
molecule selection. The vectors are characterized by an elevated 
stability and are suitable for genetic engineering modification 
of Klebsiella oxytoca VN13 endorhizosphere nitrogen 
fixer. Figures 4; references 18: 9 Russian, 9 Western.

  [Abstract] In addition to providing a protective shield for 
life on this planet, ozone is recognized as one of the most 
dangerous of anthropogenic toxicants in the atmosphere. The 
mechanism of action of ozone on microbial cells is the subject 
of intense debate. It is clear that most of the ozone, rather 
than penetrate the cell deeply, reacts with membranes and other 
surface structures to prevent the development of the microbe, 
thereby killing the microbe. Noting that other oxidants induce 
the in-cell formation of a new compound -- 
2-methylbutane-1,2,3,4-tetraol-2,4- cyclopyrophosphate -- in a 
number of bacteria, the researchers here chose to use ozone to 
determine whether the mechanism of action of that phenomenon 
hinges on an initial removal of electrons from the active 
centers of the enzymes containing NADPH or flavin, or on 
subsequent reduction of some group, or on the triggering of 
secondary oxidants formed after the single-electron reduction of 
oxygen to a superoxide radical. The Gram-positive bacteria 
Brevibacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 6872, 
Micrococcus luteus of the Fleming 2665 strain, and 
Mycobacterium smegmatis VKM As-1171 were cultivated 
to the end of the logarithmic growth phase at 30ÎC in flasks 
with 200 ml of a medium containing 1 percent peptone, 0.3 
percent yeast extract, and 0.5 percent NaCl. The cells were then 
ozonized, which produced ozone via electrosynthesis. The 
researchers found the most critical feature of the mechanism of 
action to be the ozone-induced oxidative activation of enzymes 
for the synthesis of the new cyclopyrophosphate. Membrane 
permeability was, by and large, left intact, despite major 
changes in membrane lipids. Lengthy ozonization leads to the 
disappearance of intracellular ammonigenin hydroxylamine; with 
short-term exposure, however, redox status is preserved. Figures 
3, references 15: 7 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Abstract] One of the most frequently encountered stress 
factors in nature is rapid change in temperature, or thermal 
shock, which induces the expression of a system of thermal shock 
proteins in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Earlier, the 
researchers here demonstrated the expression of thermal shock 
proteins in mycoplasma, which has an extremely small genome and 
has no cell wall. Most types of mycoplasma populate mucosa 
surfaces in animals and man. In the work reported here, the 
researchers used labelling and immunoblotting with polyclonal 
antibodies to thermal shock proteins 60 and 70 to study 
expression of thermal shock proteins. The study involved 
Acholeplasma laidlawii PG8, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae FH, M. genitalium of the strain G-37 
ATCC 33530, M. fermentans ATCC 19989, and M. 
fermentans of the incognitus strain. Cultures were grown at 
32ÎC in a liquid medium to the middle of the exponential 
growth phase. Thermal shock was effected by changing the 
temperature to 42ÎC for two hours and then changing it back 
to 32ÎC for two hours. [.sup]35[/]S-methionine was added 
after the change to 42ÎC. The cells were centrifuged, washed 
with a PBS solution, and stored at -70ÎC until they were 
taken out for use. The synthesis of thermal shock proteins in 
the A. laidlawii cells was accompanied by 
accumulation that was apparent 20 minutes after temperature 
elevation and was at its peak 1 hour after the elevation. 
Proteins p17, p65, and p72 were clearly identified on 
electrophoregram and in radioautography. Densitometry indicated 
that the quantity of base thermal shock proteins in the cells 
increased after thermal shock to 4.2 percent from 0.8 for p72 
and to 4.8 percent from 0.05 for p65, which is comparable with 
thermal shock protein accumulation in E. coli. The 
A. laidlawii cells produced a large quantity of 
low-molecular p17, which reached 7.2 percent of the total cell 
protein. Immunoblotting of proteins of several types of 
mycoplasma with polyclonal antibodies to total bacterial antigen 
showed that appreciable changes in thermal shock protein 
expression occurred in A. laidlawii and M. 
pneumoniae only. Figures 2, references 15: 1 Russian, 14 
Western.

  [Text] The reaction of coagglutination on glass, which is 
being used successfully to detect and identify bacteria, 
viruses, soluble antigens, and toxins, has gained widespread 
popularity in our country and abroad. The possibility of also 
using it to detect the causative agents of dangerous infectious 
diseases has also been demonstrated in principle (V.S. Rybkin, 
1983; G.M. Orlova et al., 1986; Yu.A. Belaya, 1987; T.M. 
Grizhebovskiy, et al., 1987; O.V. Sivkova, 1988). Our industry 
does not produce the respective diagnosticums, however. Such 
preparations are also needed to detect and identify isolated 
cultures and conduct accelerated analyses, especially under 
field conditions, in emergencies, and during mass studies. 
  This communication is devoted to the development of plague 
tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis dry 
coagglutinating diagnosticums and to the study of their use in 
different stages of bacteriologic investigation. 
  Vaccine and virulent strains of bacteria of the respective 
species were used to prepare the antigens in the experiments, 
and strains of various heterologous microorganisms were used to 
study the resultant preparations' specificity. The optimum 
schemes of producing rabbit immune sera were selected for each 
diagnosticum. Dry commercial staphylococcal reagent (produced by 
the Leningrad Epidemiology and Microbiology Scientific Research 
Institute imeni Pasteur) were sensitized by using native sera in 
accordance with recommendations. The amount of sensitizing agent 
and duration of sensitization were selected individually for 
each diagnosticum. For a working dilution, researchers used a 
dilution equal to half the maximum resulting in a preparation 
efficiently agglutinating homologous antigens. 
  The liquid diagnosticums were lyophilized in a 
saccharose-gelatin medium. Equipment produced by Friger 
(Czechosolvakia) was used. 
  When setting up the reaction, researchers applied a drop of 
prepared microbial suspension onto clean degreased glass, added 
a drop of dissolved preparation, mixed it, and examined it 
against a dark background. They checked for the absence of 
spontaneous agglutination of the diagnosticum and suspension of 
study cultures. The result was calculated over 5 minutes; a 
response to 4+ and 3+ was considered positive. 
  Three versions of plague diagnosticums were developed on the 
basis of different sera, i.e., diagnosticums to whole live 
microbial cells of the vaccine strain EV 1290, to the somatic 
antigen (fraction V) of the acapsular atoxic version of the same 
strain, and to fraction I of Yersinia pestis. The 
specific activity of these preparations was studied in 
experiments on 80 capsular and 14 acapsular strains of plague 
microbe grown at 28 and 37ÎC. The first preparation 
agglutinated bacteria of the homologous type of typical and 
atypical acapsular strains in a concentration of 10[.sup]7[/] 
microbe cells/ml and higher. The activity of the second 
preparation was on the same level; however, the formation of 
finer agglutinate with incomplete clarification of the fluid was 
frequently observed. The third preparation detected only 
capsular versions of plague causative agent. The reaction was 
clearer with bacteria grown at 37ÎC, and its sensitivity 
reached 10[.sup]6[/] microbe cells/ml with selected strains. 
Only the third preparation possessed strict species specificity, 
whereas the first and second preparations also reacted with 
selected strains of pseudotuberculosis causative agent. 
  Several versions of group-specific cholera diagnosticums 
with 
various characteristics in relation to Vibrio 
cholerae 01 and non-01 were prepared. The rabbits were 
immunized by intravenous injection of suspensions of daily 
cultures of different strains of V. cholerae 01 
subjected to prolonged boiling. Conditions to produce a highly 
specific preparation were selected. Reaction sensitivity ranged 
from 10[.sup]6[/] to 10[.sup]8[/] microbe cells/ml 
depending on the strain. Coagglutination was not observed with 
V. cholerae non-01. The diagnosticum's high 
specificity during identification of cultures isolated during 
the 1990 cholera outbreak was demonstrated. 
  To obtain a tularemia diagnosticum, animals were immunized 
with a 3x intravenous suspension of formalin-killed 
Francisella tularensis of the vaccine strain 15. In a 
study of five series of preparation using 96 strains of 
tularemia causative agent, including freshly isolated agent, the 
sensitivity of reaction with formalin-treated suspensions ranged 
from 10 to 10[.sup]-1[/] units based on standard turbidity 
and from 10 to 10[.sup]-2[/] units with boiling. With 
heterologous strains of different species of bacteria, no 
positive reaction was noted. 
  The antigen relationship of the causative agents of glanders 
and melioidosis and their serological cross-reactions make 
identification and differentiation of these bacteria difficult. 
Immune sera obtained to corpuscular antigens of each of the 
species agglutinated bacteria of both species. Cross-reactions 
were successfully eliminated by adsorbing melioidosis serum with 
glanders antigen, whereas depletion of glanders serum by 
melioidosis bacteria resulted in a loss of its activity. The 
melioidosis diagnosticum thus acquired strict species 
specificity, whereas the glanders diagnosticum agglutinated 
bacteria of both homologous strains and most strains of 
melioidosis causative agent. The reaction's sensitivity ranged 
from 10[.sup]7[/] to 10[.sup]9[/] microbe cells/ml. 
Simultaneous use of the two diagnosticums during serologic 
identification of the causative agents of melioidosis and 
glanders makes it possible to differentiate the species. 
  In a study of the reaction of coagglutination of individual 
colonies grown on dense culture media or elective colonies with 
seeding of pure or mixed cultures, the diagnosticums clearly 
detected the respective colonies, which permitted rapid 
serologic identification and a reduction in analysis time. In a 
study of coagglutination reactions, the biological material of 
animals containing tularemia causative agent were subjected to 
boiling and centrifugation. This eliminated nonspecific 
reactions, and in all cases, tularemia antigen was detected in a 
suspension of the organs of animals that had died after 
infection. The tularemia diagnosticum was used in studying field 
material during epizooty of this infection. The positive results 
in the coagglutination reaction were always confirmed by 
isolating cultures. No false-positive reactions were observed. 
The possibility of detecting cholera vibrios in feces and the 
possibility of detecting the causative agents of glanders and 
melioidosis in mixed cultures after enrichment of the material 
on elective media were demonstrated under experimental 
conditions. 
  The set of dry coagglutinating diagnosticums consisting of 
plague, tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis 
preparations that was developed may be recommended for 
identifying cultures, screening colonies, and detecting 
causative agents in biological material and in an external 
medium during an accelerated analysis process, as well as in 
quick analysis.

  [Text] Syngeneic mice of BALB/c lineage infected with 
production strains of hybridoma cells are the source of the 
specific raw material used in the production of the commercial 
diagnostic plague monoclonal anticapsular luminescing 
immmunoglobulins developed at the Mikrob All-Russia Antiplague 
Scientific Research Institute. 
  In conjunction with the unique conditions of raising and 
breeding mice of specific lineage and likely probability of loss 
of the animals' homozygoticity when their breeding expanded, we 
tried to use the most popular nonpedigree albino mice in order 
to produce ascitic fluid containing specific monoclonal 
antibodies. 
  One hundred fifty nonpedigree albino mice and 525 BALB/c 
mice 
obtained from the Mikrob institute's nursery were infected with 
the production strain of hybridoma 
Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp. The mice ranged from 18 
to 25 g in weight and 2 to 6 months in age. One to 5 weeks 
before infection, they were given intraperitoneal injections of 
the mineral oil pristane (Sigma, United States) in the amount of 
0.5 ml. 
  The specific activity of the ascitic fluid was determined 
through a reaction of indirect hemagglutination with commercial 
plague erythrocytic antigen diagnosticum manufactured at the 
Central Asia Antiplague Institute (Alma-Ata) and through the 
indirect method of fluorescing antibodies (by using luminescing 
serum) to albino mouse globulins produced by the Epidemiology 
and Microbiology Scientific Research Institute imeni N.F. 
Gamaley of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow. 
  Three groups of nonpedigree mice that each contained 
different numbers of hybridoma-inoculated cells (1-5, 5-10, and 
10-15 million, respectively) were formed to study the efficiency 
of antibody formation. The number of passages of the hybridoma 
cells in the different groups of animals ranged from 3-4 to 6-8. 
It was established that the number of mice with an ascitic tumor 
in each of the different groups was approximately identical. Of 
the 150 nonpedigree mice used in the experiments, 78 (52.0 +/- 
4.1 percent) were found to have an ascitic tumor. The time to 
autopsy of the animals amounted to 9.3 +/- 0.4 days, the volume 
of ascites amounted to 3.7 +/- 0.3 ml, and the concentration of 
hybridoma cells equaled 14.5 +/- 1.8 million/ml. The volume of 
ascitic fluid obtained per mouse fluctuated from 0.5 to 13 ml, 
and the concentration of cells ranged from 500,000 to 75 
million/ml. A total of 25 mice (16.6 +/- 3.0 percent) died, 17 
(11.3 +/- 2.6 percent) were found to be free of symptoms of 
ascitic tumor, and 55 (36.6 +/- 3.9 percent) survived after 
infection. There were no statistically significant differences 
with respect to the number of mice with ascites and the 
concentration of hybridoma cells in the ascitic fluid as a 
function of the infecting dose of hybridoma. Ascitic tumor 
formation took longer in the mice infected with 1-5 million 
hybridoma cells. The average volume of ascitic fluid obtained 
from one mouse was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in 
the group of animals treated with higher doses of hybridoma. 
  When the animals were divided into two groups based on 
passages performed, a statistically significant difference 
(p &lt; 0.01) was found with respect to the number of 
ascitic mice in the group of animals infected with hybridoma 
after 3-5 passages (66.0 +/- 4.7 percent) compared with the 
group infected after 6-8 passages (26.0 +/- 6.2 percent). From 
the first group of mice, 227.3 ml of ascitic fluid was obtained, 
and from the second group, 31.7 ml was obtained. The average 
volume of ascitic fluid obtained from one mouse was 
significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in the second group 
of animals. The increased efficiency of ascites formation in the 
animals with an elevated infecting dose of hybridoma after 6-8 
passages should also be noted. For comparison, ascitic tumor was 
recorded in 480 (91.4 +/- 2.4 million/ml) of the 525 BALB/c mice 
infected with the very same hybridoma in doses of 1-5 million 
cells after 2-12 passages. The ascites formation time averaged 7 
+/- 0.1 days, the volume of ascitic fluid amounted to 7.1 +/- 
0.1 ml, and the concentration of hybridoma cells equaled 12.4 
+/- 2.4 million/ml. The results obtained with respect to the 
latter two indicators were virtually no different from the 
respective data for the group of nonpedigree mice. 
  After 10-12 intertwinings of the hybridoma 
Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp in the bodies of the 
nonpedigree mice, it was virtually impossible to obtain ascitic 
tumors despite the injection of high infecting doses (10-20 
million cells). The animals generally survived or yielded single 
solid tumors. The efficiency of ascites formation in mice of the 
BALB/c line remained high (80-88 percent) up to the 33rd passage 
(the observation period). 
  The specific activity of the ascitic fluid obtained from the 
nonpedigree mice and the mice of BALB/c lineage were at the same 
level in the indirect hemagglutination reaction and when the 
indirect method of fluorescing antibodies was used. From the 
standpoint of its physicochemical properties and specific 
activity (working dilution of at least 1:32), the commercial 
luminescing preparation prepared on the basis of biological 
material from nonpedigree mice conformed to the requirements 
stipulated in technical norm references (Experimental-production 
Regulation No. 11-86 and Temporary Pharmacopoeia Article 
42-66VS-87). 
  It was thus established that nonpedigree mice may be used as 
a source of monoclonal antibodies to capsular plague microbe 
antigen when they are infected with the hybridoma 
Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp and that the efficiency 
of ascites formation decreases as the number of passages of the 
hybridoma cells in the bodies of nonpedigree mice increases. 
This is possibly a unique property of the specific hybridoma. It 
should be noted that the hybridoma used in this work was 
obtained in 1983. During the 7 years that followed, it was 
cloned several times and passaged numerous times during the 
process of scientific studies, scientific-technical development, 
and commercial production of the preparation on BALB/c mice that 
were acquired from various sources and that often were of 
dubious genetic standard. It may be hypothesized that a partial 
selection of cells with weakly expressed antigen properties and 
capable of adaptation in nonsyngeneic mice occurred a result of 
periodic culturing of the hybridoma 
Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp on genetically impure 
animals.

1993 (``old substances''), are subject to mandatory State 
registration within three years from the time of publication of 
these instructions. Specific registration dates must be 
coordinated with agencies of State sanitary oversight before 1 
July 1993. 
<H5>  2. Procedure for State Registration </H5>
  2.1. Chemical and biological substances (compounds) are 
registered when submitted by ministries, agencies, enterprises, 
organizations, institutions, other juridical entities, as well 
as individuals responsible for production and import of a given 
substance (compound), regardless of forms of ownership. 
  2.2. The registration process includes receiving 
applications, examining them and making the decision to 
register, and issuing a registration certificate. 
  2.3. The ``List of information needed for State registration 
of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' 
which is filled out by the applicant who is responsible for 
accuracy of furnished data, is the basis for registration. 
  2.4. Substances for which complete information could not be 
submitted at the time of registration, but the properties and 
area of application of which warrant belief that its hazard to 
man and the environment is immaterial, are subject to 
registration for a term of 3 years with assignment of a State 
registration number and issuance of registration certificated 
with annotation of the 3-year validity. Fullness (or lack of 
necessity to submit data for some parameter or other) of 
submitted information is determined in each specific instance by 
the Register in accordance with existing standard-setting and 
methodological documentation. 
  If an applicant does not submit the necessary information 
within 3 years, as stipulated in the certificate, the 
registration certificate is no longer valid. 
  2.5. In the Register, there is a permanent group of experts, 
which is confirmed following established procedure, representing 
institutions of the Goskomsanepidnadzor of the Russian Ministry 
of Environmental Protection examines the most difficult cases 
related to making decisions on State registration of potentially 
hazardous chemical and biological substances. 
  2.6. Assignment to a chemical and biological substance of a 
State registration number and issuance of a registration 
certificate confirm the adequacy and quality of ecotoxicological 
and other parameters, and serve as grounds to enter them in 
standards and specifications documentation (NTD, such as GOST, 
TU and others) in the sections ``Safety requirements'' and 
``Environmental protection.'' 
  2.7. The finding as to conformity of specific production and 
use conditions for a substance with a State registration number

specimen (Appendix 2) and information form (Appendix 3) to the 
applicant, and publishes information about registration in the 
Register's information bulletin. 
  2.13. Validity of a registration certificate can be 
suspended 
by the Register if new data are received concerning previously 
unknown hazardous properties of a substance. The Register 
notifies the applicant of suspension of the registration 
certificate and/or ban on the substance within 10 days of making 
this decision, and publishes this information in the Register's 
information bulletin. 
  2.14. The Register guarantees confidentiality of information 
about a substance that is an industrial secret unless it poses a 
threat to human health and environmental safety. 
  2.15. The Register may, under specific conditions,

  [Abstract] The ability of phosphatidyl-choline-cholesteric 
liposomes to suppress the growth of conditionally pathogenic 
microorganism and nonenzymatic self-oxidation of liposomal 
lipids which is facilitated by ultrasonic treatment and is 
accompanied by the formation of malonic dialdehyde (MDA) are 
discussed, and it is noted that the lipid peroxidation products 
(POL) are strong oxidants with a damaging effect on cell 
membranes. An attempt is made to investigate the accumulation of 
secondary lipid peroxidation products in liposomal and 
liposomal-bacterial suspensions and to study their effect on the 
growth of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture. To this 
end, liposomes are prepared from egg phosphatidyl-choline (by 
BIOS, Novosibirsk) and cholesterol (by Sigma, U.S.) in a 7:5 
molar ratio and a 25 mg/ml lipid concentration in a 0l.15 M NaCl 
solution with subsequent ultrasonic treatment at 22 kHz. The 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2134 strain is used as the 
test culture. The dynamics of malonic dialdehyde accumulation in 
liposomal suspensions with various pH values, the malonic 
dialdehyde accumulation dynamics in the liposomal-bacterial 
suspension containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells 
with various pH values, and the dependence of the 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell growth on the level of 
lipid peroxidation product accumulation in the liposome 
suspension are plotted. The findings demonstrate that during 24 
h of liposome incubation at a 37ÎC temperature, lipid 
peroxidation products are accumulated in the suspension while 
the accumulation dynamics in the liposomal suspension differ 
from their accumulation rate in the liposomal-bacterial 
suspension whereby the process intensity depends on the medium 
acidity. The lipid peroxidation products display a bactericide 
effect whose manifestation depends on the extent of lipid 
peroxidation product accumulation, liposome concentration, and 
exposure duration. Figures 3; tables 1; references 11: 10

  [Abstract] The mechanism of clinical enterobacteria strain 
resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics due to the antibiotics 
modification by three types of enzymes is discussed, and it is 
stressed that despite the great diversity of enterobacteria's 
aminoglycoresistance genes, three-to-four different types of 
encoding enzymes are predominant among clinical isolates. 
Consequently, an attempt is made to determine the types of 
enzymes produced by Serratia marcescens strains which 
inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics and to identify the genes 
which encode them. To this end, 31 aminoglycoside antibiotic 
resistant strains of Serratia marcescens isolated by 
mid-1908s are used. The experimental procedure and the 
components used are outlined in detail. The study of the 
clinical isolates' sensitivity to a number of aminoglycoside 
antibiotics did not reveal strains which are highly resistant to 
amikacin yet the microorganisms' levels of sensitivity to this 
antibiotic varied within 0.5-8 Êg/ml. The diameters of the 
micro-organism growth suppression zones and types of 
aminoglycoside activating enzymes determined by two methods are 
summarized, and the conclusion is drawn that DNA-DNA 
hybridization is a reliable method of determining the presence 
of the specific resistance genes which makes it possible to 
identify silent genes which cannot be detected by the AGRP 
method; the latter, however, is suitable for reliably 
determining the types of aminoglycoside activating enzymes 
provided that the strains do not contain genes which code the 
enzymes with overlapping resistance spectra. Thus, 85% of 
the 
strains under study contain other genes encoding aminoglycoside 
activating enzymes in addition to the gene encoding the 
AAC(6')-Ic aminoglycosideacetyltransferase; this makes these 
strains resistant to a broad range of aminoglycoside 
antibiotics. Tables 1; references 5: 2 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] The endemic rate of tularemia in many regions of 
the northern hemisphere, especially among rodents and even 
humans, and the resistance of Francisella tularensis 
to betalactam and other antibiotics prompted an examination of 
the inhibitory and bactericide activity of representatives of 
various antibiotics and chemical preparation classes to 
tularemia bacteria and an attempt to assess their interaction. 
The strains used in the experiment and their cultivation 
procedure, the antibiotics used, the measurement of the minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MPK), the study of the postantibiotic 
effect (PAE), a study of the bactericide activity, and 
statistical processing using the Statgrafics program are 
described in detail. Student's t-test was also used to assess 
the confidence of data. The minimum inhibitory concentration of 
the antibiotics and chemical preparations (in Êg/ml( relative 
to various Francisella tularensis strains, and 
interaction of the antibiotics combinations relative to various 
Francisella tularensis strains, and the antibiotics' 
bactericide activity relative to the Francisella 
tularensis are summarized, and the optical density of the 
culture after treatment with various sisomycin concentrations is 
plotted. The growth rate of the Francisella 
tularensis Schu-S4 strain after treatment with various 
antibacterial preparation concentrations (doxycyclin, 
rifampicin, sisomycin, and ciprofloxacin) is calculated for the 
0-6 and 6-24 h time intervals. The findings indicate that with 
respect to the inhibitory and bactericide action and 
post-antibiotic effect manifestation, aminoglycoside antibiotics 
and fluoridated quinolons (sisomycin and ciprofloxacin) have the 
highest activity toward tularemia bacteria while doxycyclin, 
rifampicin, and phosnodemycin have a pronounced inhibitory 
activity toward tularemia bacteria but display no bactericide 
activity; their postantibiotic effect is manifested to a lesser 
extent than that of sisomycin and ciprofloxacin. Figures 1; 
tables 4; references 13: 6 Russian, 7 Western.

  [Abstract] The proliferation of antibiotic resistant 
strains due to wide uses of antibiotics in infectious disease 
therapy and as fodder additives for agricultural livestock and 
the observed variability in the strains' resistance to 
chemotherapy preparations prompted an investigation into the 
stability of Vibrio comma isolated from the water of 
surface reservoirs in the Far East in Siberia in the past 15 
years to antibiotics. To this end, 1,383 El Tor strains isolated 
from 12 administrative regions (from Amur to Tyumen and from 
Yakutia Sakha to Buryatia) are tested for their resistance to 
eight antibiotics: ampicillin, streptomycin, monomycin, 
polymyxin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, and 
nalidixic acid. The findings do not display a common tendency 
toward increasing the resistance but confirm the observed 
variability, especially for Ap, Sm, Mn, and Pm. Of these, most 
strains are resistant to Pm, Ap, and Sm (up to 100% in 
some 
years) and the least number are resistant to Cm and Tc (0.4 and 
1.9%, respectively); in some cases a geographic 
correlation is 
established. In addition, a direct quantitative dependence of 
the resistance level on the minimum inhibitory concentration is 
revealed: the lower the the minimum inhibitory concentration, 
the fewer the number of resistant strains. The findings may be 
used for comparative retrospective analyses of the antibiotic 
resistance of Vibrio cholerae isolated in different 
regions and for solving certain epidemiological problems.

  [Abstract] The ability of the bacterial catalase to break 
up hydrogen peroxide forming during the ``respiratory 
explosion'' thus facilitating the microbe survival in the 
sensitive macro-organism and the fact that the plague microbe 
has a high catalase activity as well as reports that 
antibacterial preparations affect not only known microbial cell 
targets but also the factors which are important for revealing 
the pathogenic properties of the stimulants prompted a study of 
the effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of various groups of 
antibiotics on the catalase activity of the plague microbe. To 
this end, two strains of plague microbe--one vaccinal 
(Yersinia pestis EV1290) and one virulent 
(Yersinia pestis 1300)--are used in an experiment in 
which the strain sensitivity to antibacterial preparations is 
measured by a series of dilutions in LB agar. Systematic data 
processing is carried out by Boyarskiy's method at a confidence 
interval I[.sub]95[/] for p=0.05. The plague 
microbe cell sensitivity to such antibacterial preparations as 
ampicillin, cefaxime, gentamycin, streptomycin, rifampicin, 
doxycyclin, and polymyxin B, the effect of their subinhibitory 
concentrations at various temperatures on the catalase activity, 
and the effect of their subinhibitory concentrations on the 
virulence of Yersinia pestis 1300 are summarized. The 
study reveals that introduction of sub-inhibitory concentrations 
of ampicillin, cefotaxime, or gentamycin to the cultivation 
medium leads to a significant decrease in the catalase activity 
of the plague microbe and that virulent Yersinia 
pestis 1300 strain cells grown at a 37ÎC temperature in 
the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin or 
cefotaxime have a lower ability to cause the death of laboratory 
animals. Tables 3; references 9: 4 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] The scientific and practical importance of data 
on the interaction of plague microbes with antibiotics obtained 
in experiments with strains isolated from natural disease 
outbreaks prompted an investigation of 50 foreign strains from 
the persons infected with plague. The strains for this purpose 
were received from the Plague Scientific Research and 
Information Center in Stavropol in cooperation with the World 
Health Organization. All strains are isolated from the patients 
whose disease is clinically manifested in the cutaneous bubonic 
and septicemic forms. In addition, five plague microbe strains 
isolated from an outbreak in Central Caucasus as well as control 
strains recommended by WHO--Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli 25922, and 
Staphylococcus aureus 25923--were included in the 
experiment. In examining the U.S. strains, streptomycin, 
gentamycin, ristomycin, kanamycin, doxycyclin, and polymyxin C 
were used. The resistance of African strains to a broad range of 
antibiotics, including streptomycin, erythromycin, monomycin, 
and lincomycin was also examined. The outcome of the experiment 
was assessed after 48 h of incubation at a 28ÎC temperature. 
The sensitivity of U.S. and African strains of plague microbe to 
the above antibiotics is summarized; the standard strain 
sensitivity was consistent with WHO guidelines. The experiment 
makes it possible to assert that the plague microbe strains 
isolated from patients treated with large doses of antibiotics 
(usually streptomycin) display no appreciably noticeable 
tendency toward developing resistance to them. It is noted that 
in addition to streptomycin, gentamycin, doxycyclin, kanamycin, 
and tetracycline warrant further investigation. Tables 1;

  [Abstract] The value of third generation cephalosporins, 
particularly third generation cefotaxime which is distinguished 
from first and second generation preparations by improved 
pharmacological properties, a broader impact spectrum, and a 
higher activity to gram-negative bacteria, especially 
Enterobacteriaceae which are resistant to various 
first and second generation antibiotics, prompted an attempt to 
assess cefotaxime from the viewpoint of its activity relative to 
the plague microbe in an in vitro experiment with an 
experimental plague infection and to investigate the possibility 
of its joint use with other antibiotics. To this end, cefotaxime 
synthesized in Russia, a preparation developed by Servo Mihal 
(Yugoslavia), and amikacin (U.S.) are used in an experiment with 
albino mice. The antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration 
relative to the plague microbe strains is determined in 
Hottinger's agar while the efficiency of cefotaxime and its 
combinations with amikacin is examined in mice infected with a 
suspension of Yersinia pestis 231 whereby cefotaxime 
was injected intramuscularly. The outcome of combined 
application of cefotaxime with amikacin in prevention of 
experimental plague in albino mice is summarized. The findings 
reveal that cefotaxime--a representative of third generation 
cephalosporines--has a 0.05-0.1 Êg/ml minimum inhibitory 
concentration for natural plague microbe strains compared to 
first generation cefazolin and cephalothin and second generation 
cefmethazole, i.e., is the lowest, thus confirming its high 
efficiency in the prevention and treatment of experimental 
plague in albino mice. The results demonstrate the possibility 
of combined uses of cefotaxime and amikacin for plague infection 
prevention and treatment. Tables 3; references 7: 3 Russian, 4

  [Abstract] The scarcity of data on the efficacy of 
antibiotics against an agent form incapable of producing a 
capsular antigen (fraction I) or agent versions with the 
Fra[.sup]+[/] phenotype which are isolated in exotic foci and 
can induce disease in humans necessitated a study of the 
preventive action of tetracyclines, primarily doxycyclin, 
against the plague infection induced by a fractionless agent 
version. To this end, the Yersinia pestis 231 (708) 
strain and its fractionless versions 231 Fra[.sup]-[/].1 and 
Fra[.sup]-[/].2 are used whereby 18-20 g albino mice are 
subcutaneously infected with suspensions of agar cultures. The 
plague microbe strain's sensitivity to tetracylines is 
determined in vitro. The efficacy of doxycyclin and 
tetracycline in the prevention of experimental albino mice 
plague induced by a 100 Êg/kg injected dose of Y. 
pestis 231 and 231 Fra[.sup]-[/], a comparative analysis 
of the ED[.sub]50[/] values for doxycyclin against 
experimental plague in albino mice infected with Y. 
pestis 231 and 231 Fra[.sup]-[/] (˜1,000 
LD[.sub]50[/]) by injection, and the preventive efficacy of 
injected doxycyclin against experimental albino mice plague 
induced by Y. pestis 231 and 231 Fra[.sup]-[/] 
(˜1,000 LD[.sub]50[/]) are summarized. The study shows that 
neither an increase in the daily dose, nor an increase in the 
treatment duration ensured a high preventive treatment 
efficiency against fractionless plague agent versions, probably 
due to a change in the infectious process development. The 
conclusion is drawn that doxycyclin--a prolonged semi-synthetic 
tetracycline preparation--has a lower therapeutic efficiency 
against experimental plague in albino mice induced by a strain 
deprived of the ability to produce fraction I; this is 
manifested by higher ED[.sub]50[/] values and lower 
LD[.sub]50[/] values of this preparation against the backdrop 
of treatment and a lower percentage of animals surviving after 
intensive antibiotic therapy. The importance of taking into 
account the possibility of a decrease in the tetracycline 
efficiency for an infection induced by a fractionless agent 
version in developing treatment and prevention procedures is 
stressed. Tables 3; references 10: 6 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Abstract] A lack of data on the efficacy of 
phosphomycin--a phosphonic acid group antibiotic with a 
bactericide effect against the Escherichia coli, Proteus 
mirabilis, Psedomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Shigella 
spp., Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae, etc., 
strains--prompted a study of the efficacy of this drug and its 
combinations with other antibiotics in treating experimental 
plague in albino mice. To this end, mice were infected 
subcutaneously with a 1,250 LD[.sub]50[/] dose of the 
suspension of day-old Yersinia pestis 231 agar 
culture. Phosphomycin was injected 24 h after infection once a 
day for seven days in the amount of 2, 4, 8, and 16 g per mouse. 
The efficacy of the single antibiotic and its combinations with 
amikacin or cefotaxime was assessed using deliberately 
inadequate doses. In addition, phosphomycin and amikacin was 
administered alternately for four days. The efficacy of combined 
application of phosphomycin and amikacin or cefotaxime for 
experimental plague treatment in albino mice is summarized. The 
experiment reveals that phosphomycin is a highly efficient 
preparation for treating experimental plague in albino mice and 
demonstrates the possibility of its combined use with either of 
the two other antibiotics. Tables 1; references 10: 3 Russian, 7

  [Abstract] The declining efficacy of antibiotics at the 
late stages of plague, especially at the stages of marked 
intoxication, necessitated a study of the detoxicating action of 
antibiotics and their efficacy during the marked intoxication 
stage of experimental plague. To this end, an experiment is 
carried out on 18-20 g albino mice and 250-300 g guinea pigs 
infected with plague by injecting them with a mixture of 
fraction II of the plague microbe (according to Baker) and 
plague microbe's lipopolysachharide (LPS) obtained by Westphal's 
method. The joint toxicity of these two agents was examined. The 
plague infection was experimentally induced by subcutaneous 
injection of the Yersinia pestis 231 virulent strain, 
and treatment began 48 h after infection for mice and 72 h--for 
guinea pigs. Statistical data processing involved an assessment 
of the confidence of various relative survival indices of mice 
in experimental and control groups. The detoxicating activity of 
polymyxin B relative to the plague microbe toxin and the 
efficacy of a combination of antibiotics in starting treatment 
of experimental plague in albino mice 48 h after infection are 
summarized. The study shows that polymyxin has a detoxicating 
effect and facilitates albino mice survival at the early plague 
intoxication stage; this is attributed to the ability of 
polymyxin B to inhibit the biological activity of 
lipopolysachharide in the external membrane of gram-negative 
bacteria. The use of a single antibiotic, such as amikacin, 
rifampicin, doxycyclin, or cefotaxime, which are efficient at 
the early treatment against the background of polymyxin therapy 
at the stage of marked infection generalization increases the 
animal survivability compared to the individual use of each 
preparation. As for the guinea pigs at the same stage of 
disease, a certain therapeutic effect is observed under the 
combined use of gentamycin with trenthal or dipromonium whereby 
the life span and survival of individual animals increase. The 
conclusion is drawn that the proposed treatment is promising for 
comprehensive treatment of generalized plague infection and is 
capable of increasing the therapy efficacy. Tables 2; references

  [Abstract] The unique properties of firefly luciferase--an 
enzyme which catalyzes luciferin's organic substrate oxidation 
by atmospheric oxygen in the presence of 
adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATF) and magnesium ions--which is 
almost absolutely specific to both luciferin and ATP prompted an 
examination of the underlying principles of bioluminescent 
microanalysis using firefly luciferase. Numerous published data 
and the outcome of the author's own lab research into the use of 
luciferase in microbiology, clinical biochemistry, and proximate 
analysis of the materials' antibiotic sensitivity and resistance 
to biologically-induced corrosion are outlined. The principal 
characteristics of two ATP-reagents (microlum and immolum), the 
measurement ranges of enzyme and metabolite trace amounts using 
firefly luciferase, the ATP, PNM, and gemine content in various 
biological materials, and the microflora sensitivity to the 
effect of antibiotics are summarized. The light signal at 
various ATP concentrations for the immolum agent, calibration 
curves for detecting the ADP nucleotide, calibration curves for 
detecting biomass in various cultures, ATP concentration curves 
in measurements of the microflora sensitivity to antibiotics, 
and the calibration curve for detecting the _b_-galactosidade 
by 
the bioluminescent method are plotted. New approaches to using 
luciferase for detecting marker enzymes in enzymatic immunoassay 
analysis and nonradioactive detection of DNA samples are 
considered. Basic research and the development of enzyme 
stabilization and immobilization methods as well as the 
development of analytical procedures of luciferase applications 
open up new opportunities for bioluminescent methods in 
analytical and clinical biochemistry labs and in environmental 
and microbiological monitoring. Figures 9; tables 4; references

  [Abstract] The urgency of removing acetophenone (AF), also 
known as methylphenylketone or hypnone, an aromatic substance 
present in waste water of acetone and phenol production by the 
cumene method, from the environment due to its toxicity, and 
known advantages of biological treatment methods, e.g., with the 
help of the Nocardia and Arthrobacter 
strains, prompted attempts to isolate acetophenone-destroying 
strains from natural environmental entities, and select and 
choose the most active strains capable of utilizing acetophenone 
both in mineral media and real waste water samples. The 
acetophenone-destructor strains were isolated by a conventional 
procedure of direct soil suspension inoculation on an 
agar-treated mineral M9 medium containing acetophenone as a sole 
carbon source. The experimental procedure is outlined. The 
acetophenone-destructor strains were tested in waste water 
assays in 250 ml bulbs with 100 ml of waste water at a 
10[.sup]7[/] c/ml inoculation density. The component 
concentration was measured by gas chromatography and 
spectrophotometry methods. Six strains capable of growing in 
agarized mineral media with a 500 mg/l acetophenone 
concentration as a sole carbon source were isolated from the 38 
samples taken from phenol-producing enterprises. One was 
identified as Azomonas macrocytogenes No. 139 and 
one--as Pseudomonas putida No. 8. The remaining 
strains were nonpathogenic gram-negative bacilli. The isolated 
strains were capable of utilizing acetophenone in an up to 500 
mg/l concentration; as a result of selection, they improved 
their ability to degrade this substrate in a 625 to 1,250 mg/l 
concentration in 96-120 h. The substrate utilization and biomass 
accumulation dynamics during acetophenone biodestruction by 
strain No. 8 of Pseudomonas putida as a function of 
its concentration is plotted. After total utilization of the 
toxic substrate by the strain, the culturing liquid was less 
toxic than the initial acetophenone solution for a number of 
test microorganisms. In the authors' opinion, the isolated 
cultures are quite promising for microbiological waste water 
treatment. Figures 1; tables 1; references 13: 8 Russian, 5

  [Abstract] The ability of higher basidial fungi to degrade 
all plant biomass biopolymers, including lignin, due to their 
broad range of hydrolytic and oxidizing enzymes and mycelium's 
capacity to penetrate the substrate make basidiomycetes 
promising for bioconversion of plant materials despite their 
slow growth. An attempt is made to confirm the possibility of 
bioconversion of tea production waste by higher basidiomycetes 
in order to obtain a fungal protein and a complex of 
lignocellulolytic enzymes. To this end, higher basidial fungi 
from the Botanical Institute collection in St. Petersburg and 
Plant Biochemistry Institute of Georgian Republic's Academy of 
Sciences were examined. Solid phase fermentation (TFF) was 
carried out at 27Î in 100 ml bulbs containing 4 g (dry 
residue) of tea production waste. The experimental procedure is 
outlined. The protein concentration in the biomass was measured 
by Kjeldahl's method and the laccase activity was determined by 
the oxidation of syringaldazine, and the Mn-dependent peroxidase 
activity was measured ny the NADN oxidation. The true protein 
concentration in the solid phase tea substrate fermentation 
products was determined: it exceeded 18% after 2 weeks of 
fungal growth in such basidiomycete cultures as Cerrena 
unicolor 062, Cerrena maxima 0681, 
Coriolus hirsutus IBR-11, and Pleurotus 
ostreatus IBK-191. The true protein concentration and the 
xylanase and cellulase activity of higher basidiomycetes in 
solid phase fermentation of the tea substrate, laccase and 
Mn-peroxidase activity of basidiomycetes in solid phase 
fermentation, and true protein concentration and fermentation 
activity of P. ostreatus IBK-191 as a function of the 
nitrogen source in solid phase fermentation are summarized, and 
the growth and fermentation activity dynamics of the P. 
ostreatus IBK-191 substrate in solid state fermentation are 
plotted. The C. unicolor 062 culture displays the 
highest cellulase and xylanase activity (158.5 and 114.7 
units/g, respectively) while the Coriolus hirsutus 
IBR-11 has the highest laccase activity (4.7). P. 
ostreatus IBK-191 has the highest Mn-dependent peroxidase 
activity (5.5). Substantial differences in the activity dynamics 
of the enzymes are discovered. Organic nitrogen sources 
stimulate the xylanase and laccase production while 
KNO[.sub]3[/] sources stimulate the carboxymethylcellulase 
and Mn-dependent peroxidase production by the P. 
ostreatus IBK-191 culture. Bioconversion may be used to 
produce protein-enriched edible fungus products and plant feed 
products as well as a range of lignocellulolytic enzymes.

  [Abstract] The outlook for developing new methods of 
bioconversion of various types of agricultural products for the 
purpose of lysine production, thus making it possible greatly to 
expand its raw material production base, and the possibility of 
increasing the carbonlysine bioconversion yield and improving 
the synthesis efficiency as well as saving the consumption of 
plant substances necessary for lysine producers, e.g. 
Brevibacteria, prompted a study of the effect of 
proteases with a varying action specificity on the plant protein 
proteolysis degree and subsequent substrate bioconversion by 
lysine-producing bacteria. To this end, the 
Brevibacteria sp. lysine-producer is cultivated in 
750 ml bulbs containing 25-30 ml of nutrient medium in a 
circular rocker spinning at a 220-240 RPM speed for 66-72 h at a 
30Î temperature. The nutrient medium preparation, 
experimental procedure, and carbohydrate concentration 
measurement methods are outlined. The total amount of amino 
acids formed as a result of proteolysis is used as the basic 
indicator of the proteolytic preparation suitability for plant 
raw material conversion. Fungal protease from Aspergillus 
oryzae 251-90 (G10kh) and bacterial protease from 
Bacillus subtilis G10kh which have the necessary 
proteolytic activity level for animal proteins within a 4.7-5.3 
pH range are used for comparative characterization. The A. 
oryzae 251-90 proteolytic enzymes containing a highly 
active protease complex are the most active. The behavior of 
amine nitrogen concentration in nutrient media under the effect 
of proteolytic enzymes and the utilization efficiency of the 
resulting hydrolysates in lysine biosynthesis by the 
Brevibacteria sp. culture, the effect of A. 
oryzae 251-90 proteases on the amino acid composition of 
the plant nutrient medium, the protein amino acid content in the 
Brevibacteria sp. culturing liquid in various media, 
the free amino acid concentration in the culturing liquid during 
the growth of Brevibacteria sp., and the growth amino 
acid concentration in the nutrient media are summarized. The 
growth, carbohydrate consumption, and lysine accumulation 
dynamics are plotted. The A. oryzae 251-90 fungal 
proteolytic enzymes also indirectly but significantly affect the 
lysine-producing bacteria's biosynthetic activity. Nutrient 
medium enrichment with well-metabolized amine nitrogen increases 
the bioconversion efficacy of cereal and root tuber raw 
materials and intensifies lysine and protein biosynthesis and 
bacteria accumulation. Figures 2; tables 5; references 11.

introduction] 
  [Text] A meeting of the collegium, which was devoted to the 
tallying of the results of the work in 1993 and the 
specification of the tasks on the formulation and implementation 
of state scientific and technical policy during the year that 
has begun, was held in the Ministry of Science and Technical 
Policy of the Russian Federation. Let us acquaint the readers of 
POISK with the heads of the report of Minister Boris Saltykov 
and the conclusions, to which the collegium came after 
discussing the report. 
  The main goal of state policy in the sphere of science and 
technology is the preservation of the scientific and technical 
potential of Russia and its adaptation to the conditions of the 
market economy. 
  However, the achievement of this goal has been complicated 
by 
the real economic situation in the country, by the high 
inflation rate, by the budget deficit, by the aggravated 
political situation, and by the sweeping decrease of the demand 
for innovations, which has led to the intensification of the 
crises in the scientific and technical sphere. 
  The volume of direct contracts of enterprises with 
scientific 
organizations has decreased sharply, the share of exploratory 
research on the development of the necessary scientific and 
technical reserve in the total volume of work has declined. In 
particular, at scientific research institutes and design bureaus 
of machine building it decreased from 26 percent in 1991 to 0.8 
percent in 1993. The quantity of completed research and 
development and produced prototypes of new equipment in machine 
building has decreased in the past three years by a factor of 
11, about 60 percent of the scientific research institutes do 
not have an experimental base. 
  The building of science facilities, which were begun in 
previous years, has actually been halted. Pilot works and pilot 
plants, including unique ones that do not have analogs, are 
falling into disrepair due to the lack of assets for their 
maintenance. 
  The prestige of scientific labor has declined sharply, 
particularly due to the low wage, which in 1991 was 6.8 percent 
less and in November 1993, 38 percent less than the average for 
the national economy. The number of personnel of science and 
scientific service in 11 months of 1993 decreased by 350,000, or 
13 percent. 
  Not only the personnel potential of Russian science, but 
also 
the possibilities of its reproduction are decreasing, since the 
share of graduates of higher educational institutions, who are 
linking their career with scientific work, is decreasing. 
  As before the problem of the ``brain drain'' remains urgent. 
The representatives of the intellectual elite make up, according 
to the estimates of experts, only 5-10 percent of the number of 
specialists of the highest and intermediate skill. However, the 
loss of even one representative of the scientific and 
technological elite can be of importance for the development of 
the country and can do substantial harm. 
  The breaking of the established scientific and technical 
ties 
between the organizations and enterprises located on the 
territory of the former USSR is doing appreciable harm to the 
development of science and technology. 
  Due to the lack of currency the scale of international 
scientific cooperation has decreased noticeably. There is no 
opportunity to purchase abroad instruments, equipment, licenses, 
and scientific and technical publications. 
  The volumes of the publication of scientific and technical 
literature have declined significantly and the numbers of copies 
of it have decreased substantially due to the sharp increase of 
prices for paper and printing services. Given the overall sharp 
increase of the rates for electric and thermal power at a number 
of power-consuming institutes more than 60 percent of the budget 
assets, which are being allotted for scientific research, are 
being used to pay for energy resources. The situation with 
regard to communications services is similar. 
  The situation with the financing of research and 
development, 
the amounts of which (in comparable prices) have been decreasing 
annually, turned out to be particularly tense. Here it was 
carried out extremely unevenly and according to the remainder 
principle. In 1993 for the financing of science only 72.9 
percent of the planned assets were allocated from the assets of 
the republic budget. The debt to science in 1993 reached 300 
billion rubles [R]. The monthly principle of financing did not 
make it possible in 1993 to carry out full-fledged scientific 
activity and to conclude contracts with coperformers. 
  In spite of the difficult situation in the country, the 
scientific and technical potential of Russia remains very 
mighty. Much domestic research and development not only are 
competitive with respect to ``western'' research and 
development, but also lead the world level. Russia retains 
leadership, in particular, in the sphere of the ultra long-range 
transmission of AC and DC electric power of ultra-high voltage 
and in the development of individual types of ecologically clean 
power plants of large, intermediate, and small capacity. 
  However, the existing achievements are being assimilated 
slowly. For example, up to 30-40 percent of the developments of 
scientific organizations of the agricultural type are not 
finding use at all in production, while the genetic potential of 
strains and hybrids of agricultural crops and of breeds and 
lines of animals is being used at a level of not more than 60 
percent. 
  In 1993 a number of steps of an economic organizational 
nature, which were aimed at moderating the effect of the crises 
on the scientific and technical sphere, were taken. 
  Among the most important of them are the steps on the 
concentration of a significant portion of the scientific 
potential and financial resources on priority directions of the 
development of science and technology. 
  The practical implementation of steps on the establishment 
of 
a network of state science centers of the Russian Federation was 
also begun. The financing of the scientific and technical 
programs of 42 centers, which are performing work in priority 
directions of science and technology, including in the area of 
theoretical and experimental physics, chemistry, biology and 
biotechnology, aeronautics, astronautics, shipbuilding, optics 
and electronics, medicine and individual sectors of machine 
building, was carried out. 
  In 1993, 41 state scientific and technical programs were 
implemented, of them the Ministry of Science and Technical 
Policy of Russia was the state client for 38. These programs 
included 250 directions, which envisage the development of new 
technologies, equipment and materials for the agroindustrial 
complex, medicine and health care, power engineering and 
transportation, mining and metallurgy and chemistry, 
construction and other sectors, as well as the development of 
research in promising directions. For the purposes of increasing 
the concentration of resources on the most effective and 
promising research and development work was begun on the review 
of the composition and list of projects of the programs on the 
basis of their independent examination. 
  The competitive selection of priority technologies and new 
types of products, which are ready for use starting in 
1994-1995, was carried out. Their list was turned over to the 
Ministry of the Economy for implementation within the framework 
of state structural policy. 
  In 1993 the privatization of the scientific and technical 
sphere continued. However, the methods of privatization that are 
being used take insufficiently into account the specific nature 
of scientific and technical activity, which led at times to the 
disintegration of formed capable scientific complexes. In 
connection with this the drawing up of the draft of a decree of 
the government on privatization in the scientific and technical 
sphere, which takes its peculiarities into account, is being 
completed. For the successful implementation of scientific and 
technical policy a new system of financing, at the basis of 
which is the principle of the special-purpose financing of 
priority projects and programs with the systematic expansion of 
the practice of competitive financing, was proposed. 
  Attention should be directed to the fact that in recent 
times 
a number of important decisions on the stimulation of scientific 
and technical activity have been made. In particular, by the 
edict of the president of the Russian Federation of 22 December 
1933 goods and technological equipment, which are imported to 
the Russian Federation within the framework of free technical 
aid that is given for the conducting of joint scientific work, 
were exempt from the value-added tax [VAT]. The government 
approved lists of scientific research organizations, which are 
exempt from the fee for land and the property tax (846 
scientific institutions were exempt from the property tax in the 
tax amount of R3.47 billion, 285 scientific institutions were 
submitted for exemption from the fee for land in the amount of 
R851.5 million). 
  For the purpose of increasing the social protection of 
scientists in 1993 the concept of the establishment of a 
nonstate pension fund for the personnel of science was 
formulated and its practical testing was carried out, a statute 
on pay for the academic degree of doctor and candidate of 
sciences was prepared and approved by the Ministry of Labor, and 
the draft of a decree on pay for the academic titles of 
corresponding members and academicians of sectorial academies of 
sciences, as well as proposals on common principles of the 
establishment of longer annual leaves for scientific personnel 
who have academic degrees were sent to the government. 
  Particular attention in 1993 was devoted to questions of 
cooperation with the regions. The Ministry of Science and 
Technical Policy of Russia formulated the concept of regional 
scientific and technical policy. Financing for the support of 70 
regional scientific and technical programs and 47 projects was 
allotted on a matching basis from the republic budget. Assets 
from local sources were enlisted in the financing of these 
efforts. Interregional scientific and technical programs, of 
which the Siberia, Chernozem Zone, and Ural programs are the 
most prominent, were also implemented. The bulk of the programs 
and projects underwent examination through the Interdepartmental 
Council of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of 
Russia and the presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences for 
regional scientific and technical policy and cooperation with 
the higher school. 
  In 1993 the work connected with the enlistment of foreign 
firms in the implementation of state scientific and technical 
programs was coordinated. Financial support was given to Russian 
scientific organizations that are performing work within the 
framework of 514 international scientific and technical projects. 
  A number of agreements on scientific and technical 
cooperation with countries of the CIS, including on the 
conducting of joint work in the area of welding, powder 
metallurgy and new ceramics and on laser technologies, were 
signed. A database on scientific facilities of joint use is 
being developed. 
  An intergovernmental agreement of the countries of the CIS 
on 
the interstate exchange of scientific and technical information, 
which is of great importance for the preservation of the formed 
information ties and the furnishing of collections with 
materials on the achievements of science and technology, was 
concluded. 
  Taking into account that the steps taken in 1993 in the area 
of science and technology do not encompass the entire set of 
accumulated problems and on the basis of the government program 
of the development of reforms and the stabilization of the 
Russian economy, one should regard as the most important tasks 
for 1994: 

  -  the concentration of state resources on the development of 
large science centers and the implementation of state scientific 
and technical programs which ensure the comprehensive solution 
of scientific and technical problems in the directions, in which 
domestic science holds leading positions, and the increase of 
the effectiveness of research and development and the work on 
the assimilation of new science-intensive products and 
technology; 
  -  the development of basic research in the most promising 
directions and state support of the academic sector of science 
and enterprising scientific projects; 
  -  the specification of a National List of Priority Directions 
of 
the Development of Science and Technology, as well as a list of 
state scientific and technical programs and key (critical) 
technologies as the basic guideline when spending assets of the 
federal budget on science; 
  -  the completion of the preparation of proposals for submission 
to the government on the conferring of the status of State 
Science Centers, bearing in mind that the number of these 
centers should be limited; 
  -  the specification of unique scientific facilities, which are 
liable to priority state support, as well as the making of an 
inspection of the formed network of budget-carried organizations 
of federal subordination for the purpose of determining the 
scientific organizations, which have a negligible scientific 
potential and are operating inefficiently, and settling the 
question of their retention as state scientific organizations; 
  -  the formation and development of the market infrastructure 
and 
innovation activity, the establishment of effective mechanisms 
of the operation of science and technology parks, business and 
innovation centers, incubators of small innovation enterprises 
and other advanced forms of innovation activity; 
  -  the privatization of facilities of the scientific and 
technical 
sphere with allowance for the necessity of ensuring in so doing 
the legal protection of objects of intellectual property; 
  -  the improvement of the financing of science, including the 
establishment of a fixed fraction of allocations, which is 
envisaged in the federal budget for civilian research and 
development, the increase to 5 percent of the fraction of the 
deductions for the Russian Basic Research Fund, and the 
legalization of extrabudgetary research and development funds, 
which should become the basic source of financing of sectorial 
and intersectorial applied research and development; 
  -  the stimulation of scientific and enterprising activity, 
including through the establishment of preferential rates for 
electric and thermal power for scientific institutions, the 
increase of the interest of enterprises in innovations by the 
granting of tax credits; 
  -  the increase of the social protection of personnel of the 
sphere of science and technology; 
  -  the development of cooperation with the regions in the area 
of 
science and technology, including questions of the choice of 
regional scientific and technical priorities, the formulation 
and implementation of regional scientific and technical 
programs, and their support with the use of a multiplicity of 
sources of financing; 
  -  the improvement of international and interstate (with the 
countries of the CIS) cooperation; 
  -  the preparation of legislative and legal acts that regulate 
relations in the scientific and technical sphere. 

    Having discussed the questions at hand, the collegium of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technical Policy 
noted the vague delimitation of responsibility and spheres of 
activity in the scientific and technical area among federal 
executive bodies, between federal and regional organs of power, 
as well as their inadequate cooperation. This is one of the 
causes of the unjustified duplication of research and 
development, the inefficient use of financial and material 
resources, the inadequate cooperation and comprehensiveness in 
the solution of scientific and technical problems, and the lack 
in a number of cases of their orientation toward the end 
results. In practice the necessary unity in the formulation and 
pursuit of scientific and technical policy is absent. 
  The collegium considered it expedient to prepare suggestions 
on the improvement of the mechanism of the formulation and 
implementation of state scientific and technical policy, having 
in mind, in particular: 

  -  the increase of the status of the Interdepartmental 
Coordinating Commission for Scientific and Technical Policy and 
its provision with real powers for the coordination and the 
elaboration of coordinated approaches of federal bodies of 
administration in the implementation of the unified state 
scientific and technical policy; 
  -  the delimitation of the functions and spheres of 
responsibility 
of federal executive bodies in the scientific and technical 
area, the specification of their powers in the formulation and 
implementation of scientific and technical policy in the 
assigned area, as well as the delimitation of the functions in 
this sphere between federal and regional executive bodies; 
  -  the assignment of the preparation of summary proposals on the 
pursuit of the unified state scientific and technical policy in 
the civilian sphere to the Ministry of Science and Technical 
Policy of Russia. 

    It was deemed necessary to increase the responsibility of 
deputies ministers, the chiefs of administrations, and 
specialists of the ministry for the timely and high-quality 
fulfillment of the tasks assigned to the Ministry of Science.

``The Experts Seek a Formula''--first paragraph is POISK 
introduction] 
  [Text] An international seminar devoted to the problem of 
the ``brain drain'' from Russia was held in Moscow on 21-23 
February. The Russian Federation Ministry of Science and 
Technical Policy, the Committee for the Problem ``The Brain 
Drain'' under the Russian Federation Commission for UNESCO 
Affairs, and the Regional Office of Science and Technologies for 
Europe (UNESCO-ROSTE) organized it. The Russian and foreign 
experts discussed the draft of a report, which was prepared for 
this meeting. It will be submitted in the form, which has been 
worked out following evaluation by the experts, to the 
Government of the Russian Federation for decision making. Let us 
acquaint the readers of POISK with excepts from this document. 
<H5>  Introduction: Science of Russia During the Transition Period </H5>
  During the late 1980's and early 1990's a significant abrupt 
increase of emigration from the country was observed. This wave, 
which was due, on the one hand, to the intensifying 
socio-economic crisis of society and, on the other, to the 
liberalization of the policy of the regulation of departure, 
encompassed practically all social groups of the population of 
Russia, including intellectuals. It should be acknowledged that 
precisely the latter suffered to the greatest degree from the 
social consequences of the crisis, while the dire straits of 
science and the higher school of Russia under the conditions of 
the sharp decrease of budget allocations in 1992-1993 will 
undoubtedly provoke the intensification of the ``brain drain'' 
in the immediate future. 
  If the absolute figures of the departure of personnel from 
science remain at the 1991-1992 level, by 1990-2000 it will 
cease its existence in Russia. If the relative magnitude of 
departure remains, by 2000 in science the number of employees 
will come to about 700,000, that is, 25 percent of the 1992 
level. Russian experts regard this version in case of the 
maintenance of the present course of reform in the country as 
most realistic. 
  The decrease of employment will be most significant in 
1993-1995, then its pace will slow, and a certain personnel 
stabilization will occur. Thus, it is anticipated that the share 
of science by 2000 will decrease in the structure of employed 
people from 3.4 percent to 1 percent. 
<H5>  The Scale of the Migration of Scientific Personnel </H5>
  The geography of external migration is rather broad, it 
encompasses practically all continents. However, an overwhelming 
portion of the emigrants are heading for four basic countries. 
Of the total number of people who left Russia before 1993, 45 
percent of the emigrants went to Israel, 37 percent went to 
Germany, 12 percent went to the United States, and 2 percent 
went to Greece. 
  The flow of emigrants to the United States is characterized 
by the greatest ``science-intensiveness.'' According to the 1992 
data, among those who left 33 percent are people with a higher 
education and 44 percent are white collar workers. In three 
years (1990-1993) 4,500 scientists emigrated to the United 
States. 
  Along with this the emigration of Russian scientists to 
Third 
World countries, which in contrast to, for example, the United 
States and Germany are making a demand for scientific personnel 
of intermediate skill, increased appreciably. A big demand for 
Russian scientists, first of all for professors and instructors, 
exists in China. The arrival of about 1,000 Russian scientists 
in South Korea is anticipated. Iran and Iraq, which are 
interested first of all in importing specialists in the field of 
nuclear technologies and are prepared to pay them significantly 
more than the average annual salaries of nuclear physicists in 
the United States, are not concealing their interest in 
scientists from the CIS. 
  The process of the adaptation of Russian scientists to work 
in the West is not uniform. The scientific elite primarily gets 
jobs at universities and other scientific organizations, 
combining teaching activity with scientific pursuits. The 
results of a survey among mathematicians and theoretical 
physicists (96 doctors and 54 candidates of sciences, who work 
at scientific centers of the United States, Canada, Western 
Europe, and Australia) show that more than 70 percent of the 
surveyed scientists adapted easily to the new situation. The 
overwhelming majority of them (90 percent) believe that work 
abroad as a whole justified their expectations. 
  At the same time a large portion of the scientific 
personnel, 
who left Russia through the channels of ethnic emigration, were 
forced to leave the sphere of research and development, and this 
switch is of an irreversible nature. The share of ``unlucky 
people,'' according to the data of the survey, came to 3-5 
percent, but for emigre Russian scientists as a whole it is 
significantly higher. 
  In the opinion of 50 surveyed executives of leading foreign 
scientific centers, the problems of the adaptation of emigre 
Russian scientists are due to a poor knowledge of foreign 
languages (75 percent of the respondents), difficulties in 
dealings with colleagues (21 percent) and with students (67 
percent), and the ignorance of foreign scientific literature (17 
percent). 
  According to the data of a sample survey of the movement of 
personnel at 10 scientific research institutes of the capital 
(the total number of scientists is 3,746), which was conducted 
in 1992, in 10 months 1 percent of the scientific personnel (6.7 
percent of all people who got their discharge) got their 
discharge from the surveyed institutes and went abroad, 60 
percent of those who left are scientists up to the age of 40, 41 
percent of those who left had degrees, including 12 percent who 
had doctoral degrees. It is possible to regard an estimate of 1 
percent as the maximum value of the indicator of scientific 
emigration from Russia during 1992. Here the share of foreign 
emigration in 1992 does not exceed 2 percent of the total 
departure of personnel from the sphere of research and 
development for other spheres of activity within Russia and 
migration about the territory of the former USSR. The share of 
those leaving, who worked in the sector ``science and scientific 
education,'' as a whole for Russia during 1987-1992 came to 6 
percent. 
  During a sociological survey that was conducted among 18 
scientific institutes, 42 percent of the respondents indicated 
that they were pondering in earnest leaving for work abroad, 
although the opportunities for this for the present do not 
exist, 8 percent of the respondents intend to leave in the 
immediate future, and 5 percent of the respondents are 
considering the question of their going abroad because an 
opportunity for work abroad has personally appeared for them. 
Only 23 percent of the respondents are not considering the 
possibility of their going abroad. 
  Analyzing the prospects of the solution of this problem, 31 
percent of those who responded to the question about the ``brain 
drain'' indicated that the factors, which are responsible for 
the departure of scientists from the country, are of a 
deep-seated nature and cannot be eliminated in the immediate 
future. The respondents assigned ``the present state of 
society'' to the overall cause of the difficulties that are 
being experienced by academic science. 
  As the second set of factors, which are responsible for the 
departure of scientists abroad, the respondents indicate the 
formed low level of prestige of science in society, the 
atmosphere of vulnerability and lack of protection, in which 
science has found itself, and the uncertainty for scientists of 
their future. Having a depressing effect on scientists is the 
lack of demand for their creativity abilities. Forty-six percent 
of the scientists believe that they are realizing their 
scientific potential fully, 31 percent believe that they are 
using only half of it, 13 percent believe that they are using it 
to a small degree. 
  The theme of the remuneration of the labor of scientific 
associates as one of the decisive factors, which is responsible 
for the ``brain drain,'' is touched upon during the sociological 
surveys by nearly all the respondents. The absolute majority of 
scientists believe that it is necessary to raise the level of 
remuneration of scientific labor to international standards, 
having increased it by 10- to 30-fold. The changeover to a 
contract system in the conducting of research is suggested as 
the most important step in this direction. 
  In second place in importance is the underestimation by 
society of the social importance of intellectual labor (53 
percent noted this as a reason for departure). Fifty percent 
rate nearly as highly the inadequate opportunities to realize 
oneself as a scientist in Russia. Forty percent of the 
scientists, professors, and instructors of Moscow higher 
educational institutions noted the instability of the political 
situation and the threat of social disorders as a reason for 
leaving. Thirty-five percent of the respondents name as a reason 
for leaving anxiety over the fate of their children. Just as 
many respondents named as a reason for the emigration of 
scientists the overall deterioration of the economic situation 
and the threat of unemployment. Another 19 percent of the 
respondents noted as a reason for emigration the low level of 
protection of scientists and of the legal registration of the 
results of scientific activity. 
  The evaluations of the respondents, which were given during 
this survey, of the social and psychological factors that affect 
the decision of a scientist to go abroad, are also interesting. 
Eighty-four percent of the respondents named as such a factor 
the dissatisfaction with living conditions; 28 percent--the 
desire to conduct research in a stronger scientific collective; 
26 percent--a young age; 22 percent--talent, a high intellectual 
potential; 13 percent--the existence of scientific contacts with 
foreign partners and scientific centers. 
  Among the fields of science, which have been particularly 
affected by emigration, one should name first of all mathematics 
and computer technology. In recent years the demand for 
programmers from Russia, first of all young people, has 
increased on the international labor market. The number of 
mathematicians leaving for the West today constitutes a 
significant share (25 percent) of the annual graduation of these 
specialists by elite faculties. The losses among physicists are 
also substantial. 
  Of course, the states, which are accepting our scientists, 
are interested in obtaining not ``ballast,'' but the most 
talented, promising scientists who have created a name for 
themselves in science by great achievements. 
  As a result the most actively working, talented young people 
and middle-aged scientists, who have already achieved 
significant scientific results and are known through 
publications abroad, are leaving the country. A large portion of 
the scientists from the RAS, who have left for permanent 
residence abroad, have the degree of candidate (55.9 percent) 
and doctor (16.2 percent) of sciences. Nearly half (48.5 
percent) of those who have left the country have not reached the 
age of 40. 
  As was noted, during 1990-1992 a significant decrease of the 
number of scientific personnel occurred. In 1993 this process 
continued, and in five months the number of scientific 
specialists of scientific and technical organizations (NTOs) 
decreased, according to the estimates of experts, by 7 percent, 
which makes it possible to predict an overall decrease during 
1993 in the amount of 13-15 percent. This departure is 
objectively due to the redundancy of the market of scientific 
and technical labor, which finds its expression in the low level 
of the wage in science, periodic organized reductions of 
personnel, the narrowing of the possibilities for the conducting 
of work that interests the scientist and the specialist, and the 
stressful psychological atmosphere in scientific collectives. 
  Until recently inadequate attention was devoted to the 
analysis of this ``internal migration,'' although in scale it is 
more significant than emigration beyond the country. According 
to the data of sample surveys of 1992 and 1993, there are 10-15 
scientists, who left NTOs in search of better work, for each 
scientist who has emigrated. 
  What socio-economic consequences can such a pace and scale 
of 
migration have for Russia? 
  Under the influence of external and internal 
(intersectorial) 
migration the scientific and technical potential is weakening 
substantially, particularly with allowance made for the 
long-term consequences for the training of new generations of 
scientists and specialists. On a broader plane the country may 
lose the stratum of people, which is necessary for the 
maintenance in society of a balanced social strategy in the 
context of the chosen scientific and technical policy. 
  The country is undoubtedly incurring considerable material 
losses, which it spent on the training of specialists and 
scientific personnel. The calculations, which were made by the 
United Nations method (the subtraction from the gross national 
product of the direct and indirect outlays on the training of 
the personnel who leave and the lost gain from the activity of 
emigrants in this country) as of the beginning of 1991, show 
that in case of the departure of one specialist the country 
loses about $300,000. If the forecast of the annual migration of 
the Ministry of the Economy of Russia--200,000-250,000 people 
annually--is confirmed, the country will annually lose $60-75 
billion. 
<H5>  The Problems of State Regulation of Intellectual Migration </H5>
  Under present conditions the state cannot pose the task of 
not only the complete halt of the departure of scientists 
abroad, but also its significant reduction in the next few 
years. Attempts to complicate departure from the country by the 
creation of administrative barriers would be at variance with 
the legislation of Russia and with international obligations in 
the area of human rights. 
  The formulated draft of the Federal Program of the 
Regulation 
of Intellectual Migration is called upon to unite the efforts of 
state bodies and alternative structures, international 
organizations and foundations, and the scientific community in 
the interests of protecting the domestic intellectual potential. 
  The goals of the program are: the development of the 
principles and mechanisms of the long-term national policy of 
Russia in the area of the migration of scientists and 
specialists and the formation of a set of specific steps on the 
implementation of this policy; the reduction to a minimum of the 
harm from the departure abroad of the scientific and technical 
and the creative intelligentsia by the creation of adequate 
organizational legal and socio-economic working and living 
conditions of scientists and specialists in Russia and their 
effective participation in the international division of labor. 
  The development of a rational mechanism of the management of 
the process of intellectual migration and the creation of the 
conditions for its efficient operation are a most important task 
of the program. 
  The basic measures of the program can be implemented in 
three 
stage. At the first stage the task of preserving the scientific 
elite of Russia and of not allowing the leading scientific 
schools of the country to perish is advanced. At the same time 
it is necessary to place the process of the ``brain drain'' in a 
civilized framework. For these purposes it is planned to make 
efforts for the change of the form of migration from emigration 
without return (which still predominates) to temporary contract 
migration. 
  At the second (intermediate-term) stage a substantial change 
in connection with the changeover to a market of the structure 
of science, the forms and sources of its financing, and so on is 
proposed. Along with the state, the role of which will gradually 
decrease, independent structures, joint-stock companies, and 
various structures will become the clients of developments of 
scientists. The transformation of science in these directions 
creates favorable conditions for mutually advantageous 
cooperation with foreign scientific centers and firms, which 
produce science-intensive products. All this will make it 
possible to stabilize scientific research and development and 
then will ensure their development and growth, which will affect 
fundamentally the migration of intellectuals. 
  The third, long-range, stage of the regulation of 
intellectual migration can begin when Russia, having overcome 
the difficulties of the transition period, has formed a dynamic 
market economy and an efficiently functioning civilian society 
that makes a great demand for scientific ideas. This stage will 
afford real opportunities for the extensive return of emigre 
scientists to the homeland, as well as for the attraction of 
foreign scientists for work at Russian science centers. 
  The program is a state and long-term one and is approved by 
a 
decree of the government. The overall coordination of the work 
under the program is being carried out by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. 
  State participation in the financing of the program 
presumes: 

  -  the allocation of budgetary funds for the development of 
science, culture, and higher education with allowance for 
potential aggravations of the problem of intellectual migration; 
  -  the establishment of preferential conditions of taxation for 
enterprises and firms in case of the making by them of 
investments or the implementation of other projects that 
contribute to the achievement of the goals of the program; 
  -  the mobilization of the assets being received from domestic 
and 
foreign nongovernmental organizations. 

    There should become the basic forces of the implementation 
of 
the program: first, government bodies, whose activity the 
Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of Russia coordinates; 
second, the scientific community, the public, and 
representatives of commercial structures and the mass media; 
third, international organizations and foundations, as well as 
the corresponding structures of the countries which are giving 
aid to Russian science; fourth, the appropriate subdivisions of 
the Federal Migration Service of Russia. 
  After the approval of the program at the state level a 
special subdivision (an administration or an agency for 
questions of intellectual migration), which performs the 
functions of the general management of the program, as well as 
an interdepartmental scientific council with the attraction of 
representatives of the scientific community, experts of 
international organizations, and so forth, which is responsible 
for the scientific, including research, support of the program 
are established within the Ministry of Science and Technical 
Policy . 
  The All-Russian Scientific Labor Exchange, which deals on a 
commercial basis with the entire set of questions connected with 
the support of the entire set of questions connected with the 
assurance of civilized conditions of the transfer of scientists 
and specialists. 
  The exchange in cooperation with the mass media (at the 
first 
stage the newspaper POISK) and other structures are publishing 
in Russian and English a special bulletin (the working name is 
SCIENCE EXCHANGE) with information on all questions that are 
important for the participants in the process of intellectual 
migration and for donor countries and recipient countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Lobacheva: ``Far-Sighted Plato and Wise </F>
Keldysh, or How the Academy of Sciences is Trying to Survive 
Under the New Economic Conditions''; the first four paragraphs 
are an introduction] 
  [Text] An enormously long time has passed since the first 
academy made its appearance. Almost four centuries before the 
birth of Christ, about twenty centuries since the year 1 A.D. 
Precisely this time interval, almost inconceivable to the 
reasoning of an ordinary person, excuses anyone who has 
forgotten on what was based the Platonic Union, having as its 
purpose the honoring of the muses. I will therefore refresh your 
memory. 
  First Plato, who decided to gather scientific fellow 
thinkers 
and opponents around him, acquired (on his own resources)the 
gymnasia and the garden in which these academic institutions 
were located. To the point, the name of his academy was given in 
memory of the mythological hero Akademus, whose name was given 
to the garden purchased by Plato. Then students came to the 
gymnasia who spent their time both in philosophical arguments 
and for exercises in mathematics, astronomy, natural science and 
other sciences. Probably in order to think better the academy 
members, that is, the academicists, voluntarily limited their 
sleep, refrained from carnal love and consumption of meat. 
  Our modern world organized its academies without having 
recourse to such self-tortures. And nevertheless the scientific 
associations traditionally bearing the name ``academy'' in most 
well-developed countries are usually striving to perpetuate the 
Platonic tradition. Existing on the resources of their own 
members as some councils of authorities recognized in the 
scientific world, to the extent which they are able they are 
endeavoring to support young scientists, are striving to inform 
mankind of scientific advances, are trying to ward off 
ecological catastrophes and are serving as experts when 
initiating and implementing scientific and technical programs 
capable of changing the life of the planet, etc., etc. Only 
Russia in its time has pursued a different course. 
  It is possible to understand Peter the Great, who himself, 
in 
essence, was the first Russian academician. The state took under 
its wing and gave state support to anyone who could contribute 
to the power of Russia. The scientist was no exception. And so 
it went -- the Russian Academy always was supported from the 
public treasury. Academicians and professors, to be sure, were 
not rewarded with mountains of gold, but in general they lived 
rather comfortably. 
  The Soviet government demanded loyalty from scientists and 
in 
exchange offered the same support to all from the public 
treasury. Those who categorically rejected such conditions were 
banished or killed and those who remained were forced to accept 
the benefaction of the state. 
  Least of all do I want to accuse scientists of conformity. 
Yes, in the history of Soviet science there are very unpretty 
pages, but in the history of our country there are far more. But 
that is not at all what we are discussing here. Existing on the 
money of the Soviet state, Soviet science achieved more than a 
few successes, acknowledged as such by the entire civilized 
world. Under modern conditions, however pitiful it may be, all 
the most appreciable and fundamentally new scientific 
discoveries were made in fields in one way or another associated 
with defense. The military machine was swollen to the limit, 
requiring newer and newer specialists, newer and newer 
equipment. And together with it there also was an excessive 
increase in the number of scientific workers, institutes (for 
the most part closed and highly secret) and laboratories, 
scientific fields, themes, subthemes, minor themes simply being 
of some interest, those requiring the confirmation of ideas... 
And everything was funded virtually without restrictions. 
  As a result, in the prosperous year 1980, within the 
framework of the USSR Academy of Sciences alone, there were more 
than 250 scientific institutions at which about 42,000 
scientific specialists, 269 academicians and 536 corresponding 
members worked. So-called applied science (scientific research 
institutes operating under the departments, ministries, branch 
academies and institutions of higher education) increased these 
figures threefold as a minimum. The selected state form of 
organization of science remained patriarchal and unchangeable. 
It was born from the entire structure of economic control, it 
was centralized to the limit, was militarized, in essence 
ignoring the very concept of efficiency, and was closely linked 
to it. The economy went on the skids, and science went with it. 
This fact, however, exerted almost no influence on the financial 
position of either scientific workers or scientific 
institutions. Academicians received 500 rubles monthly for life 
and corresponding members received 350. An effort was made not 
to admit the unworthy to this steady, ensured life. Doctors and 
candidates of science routinely squabbled with one another, 
wangling funding for one research topic or another. Deathblows 
were inflicted on dozens in striving to live long enough to 
receive the pay of a junior scientific specialist... 
  And suddenly all this remained in the past. Including the 
detested trips to the vegetable commissaries. And a clearly 
designated day for receiving one's wages. And stable funding of 
a research topic over which a laboratory had already sweated for 
some years. And faith in a bright future, ensured by the mantle 
of the Academy. Well, to be sure, not many counted on achieving 
the rank of academician. But now virtually all were 
thunderstruck by the other innovations. And it got worse for 
everyone. 
  Despite the breakup of the country of which we all were 
citizens a few years ago, the number of representatives of 
science in Russia alone has considerably surpassed the figures 
cited two paragraphs above. The number of scientific 
institutions has increased to 445, about 61,000 scientific 
workers are now employed in their work force and there are 419 
academicians and 594 corresponding members in the ranks of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences. And once again, as in the past 
example, the branch workers also considerably swell these 
figures. And it has become clear that the state is in no 
position to maintain this bulky and cumbersome structure. 
  Scientists must be given their due: some of them foresaw 
such 
a turn of events. Academician L. Keldysh, director of the 
Physics Institute of the Academy of Sciences, already two years 
ago in the VESTNIK [Herald] of the Academy of Sciences, 
published his prediction that the forms of organization of 
science prevailing in our country were impossible in any 
reasonable economy and he proposed his own program for the 
preservation of science and reorganization of the Academy. He 
directly raised questions concerning what kind of science was 
needed by a country experiencing hard times, whether society was 
in a position to support it and what had to be done in order to 
preserve fundamental science in a volume allowing the 
resurrection of the status of our country as one of the leading 
in the world. No one listened. Or did they not wish to listen? 
  The Academy has many other concerns. It is already the 
second 
month, for example, that its presidium has been busy trying to 
wangle the allocated budgeted sums for maintenance of the 
Academy from the Ministry of Finance. The money is coming, but 
with a great delay, and therefore is depreciated before reaching 
the pocket of the scientific specialist or the institute at 
which he works. The academicians are becoming nervous. As always 
in such cases, those responsible for the prevailing situation 
have already been found: these are the Ministries of Finance and 
Science and Technical Policy. The other day the list of the 
guilty parties was supplemented by still another department: the 
Ministry of Labor, which published an explanation of payment for 
the activity of scientific workers that did not fully satisfy 
the Academy, that is, its full members. 
  Do not hurry to take on faith the assertion by the Academy 
that the government is by plan destroying Russian science. Under 
very difficult conditions the state last year was able to 
allocate 130 billion rubles for maintaining the Academy (in the 
relatively prosperous year 1990 this sum was 1.9 billion). Is 
this a great sum? To be sure, it is inadequate. And although for 
each worker -- and according to the personnel department, 
together with watchmen and mechanics there is a total of 138 402 
people -- almost a million rubles is allocated for the year, it 
must be understood that 30% of this money is ``eaten up'' 
by 
expenditures for electric power, water, heat and rent, and 
60% 
is for salaries, true with a frightful lag, but nevertheless 
indexed. In actuality, no budgeted money remains for science. 
About 35 billion additional was received for carrying out 
scientific research from different funds and programs set up and 
managed under the patronage of the Ministry of Science and 
Technical Policy. The Academy is very nervous that these sums 
may be received only by winning in a competition. It has been 
the custom that the institutes receive money only from the hands 
of the presidium. And therefore the ministry is being accused of 
fine management, and in its place it is proposing its own 
services. With respect to distribution, naturally. 
  But meanwhile at the Academy institutes changes are 
nevertheless going on. Applications are being drawn up for 
grants from different funds; good possibilities are being 
afforded not only by the Soros Fund, but also by the Russian 
Fundamental Research Fund and by different foreign universities, 
and soon a Fund for Research in the Humanities and a 
Technological Fund will be in operation. For the time being all 
these apparent changes are on the initiative of the Ministry of 
Science and Technology. The Academy presidium, however, 
dispatching one letter after another to the president of the 
country, as before is asking for only one thing: money, money, 
money. 
  In December the salaries were increased for scientific 
workers under the budget. By a factor of 1.9. It is true that 
there are no funds for implementing this increase. But for the 
academicians not everything was clear: a presidential decree had 
stipulated life payments of 150,000 rubles for academicians and 
75,000 for corresponding members. But, indeed, each of them 
already has an academic degree and therefore it was expected 
that the increased salaries would automatically be supplemented 
by a 50% increment for a doctoral degree. The Ministry of 
Labor, however, insists that the scientific degrees have already 
been allowed for in the salaries of the Academy elite. This has 
already been kicked around several times in the government and 
no one can make sense of who is right in this situation. 
  Somehow it is even awkward to tell about all this. 
Involuntarily one recalls: when during the past year the Soros 
Fund, taking into account the low wages of scientific workers, 
announced the possibility of payment of 500-dollar stipends and 
as a condition stipulated that the competitors have published 
works in publications authoritative in the scientific world 
during the last five years, only 23,000 such scientific workers 
were found in Russia. The Americans sent notifications of the 
awarding of the 500-dollar stipends to the home addresses of 
those receiving the awards, having evidently heard a lot about 
our academic customs. The presidium, however, has given no 
attention to the scandalous character of the situation -- 
although it was high time to do so. It advanced from its ranks 
of servants of science candidates for the title ``outstanding 
scientist'' and ``young talent.'' Now in the heart of the 
Academy institutes there are 5000 ``outstanding scientists'' who 
have been tapped for a 75,000-ruble scientific stipend and 
another thousand ``young and talented'' scientists designated by 
the state for a 50,000-ruble increment to their salary... 
  An infinite number of examples can be cited. When certain 
problems are solved new ones arise. A solution is found for some 
and others lie in wait. And it is becoming clear that by 
cultivating the incomprehensible status of the Academy as some 
public-state structure, the problems of fundamental science, 
alas, are not being solved. It is the opinion of A. Shabad, 
co-chairman of the Academy's Electors Club, that the time has 
come to stop hiding one's head under the wing of undesignated 
state funding. The activity of the Academy must be directed into 
the juridical channel. If it is a public organization it should 
exist at the expense of its founders or sponsors. However, if it 
is a state organization it must be admitted that the state has 
the right to determine the priority purposeful programs and fund 
them with rigorous bookkeeping and oversight. And the illusions 
that it is possible to suffer through the tough times, just hang 
in, outwait the difficult times, while remaining in the former 
incomprehensible status, have no basis whatsoever. 
  It must be honestly acknowledged, as Academician Keldysh 
appealed for two years ago, that a rigid restriction must be 
placed on the number of research fields and projects supported 
by society, henceforth being oriented solely on first-class 
undertakings and maintaining them at a level as close as 
possible to the world level. And nevertheless there is no money 
left over and in the immediate future there is evidently nowhere 
from which it can come. Therefore scientific workers must not be 
fed the illusions of far-reaching changes. The meager wages (and 
at some institutes the salaries of old-timers do not exceed 
25-40 thousand rubles) do not solve any problems but only 
aggravate them. It happens that some man of science within the 
walls of his own institute sees, perhaps on payday, the same pay 
that he earned long ago at a different place and for performing 
completely different obligations, and has to settle for it. It 
not rarely happens that so-called commercial activity, based on 
the equipment and carried out in the facilities belonging to an 
institute, inevitably results in the cutoff of work on 
scientific problems and the income supposedly received from such 
activity does not even cover payments for communal services. So 
is it worthwhile to continue the agony? 
  Evidently the time has come for a return of science to the 
walls of the universities (not the numerous newcomers, but those 
where there are recognized scientific schools). There is nothing 
unusual in this -- in the world there are exceedingly few 
examples of scientific pursuits which are detached from 
university centers. And without dragging it out, there should be 
an expert evaluation of all scientific projects, making it 
possible to bring together in scientific centers those who are 
capable of doing this. Many far-sighted scientific directors, 
incidentally, are already doing this. But the academicians, 
evidently, must be guided by Platonic principles of organization 
of scientific cooperation. So it has come about that Peter the 
Great's model has come to an end. Possibly the desire of 
Academician Keldysh not to remain in the position of 
academician-secretary of one of the academy departments can be 
considered a first step in this direction? In this way he 
decided to protest against an unreasonable form of organization 
of science, feeling that any attempt at artificially prolonging 
its existence will have sorrowful consequences for science. 
Possibly it is necessary to trust his instinct in this case as 
well?

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Myakinnik: ``The `Gold Reserve' of </F>
Russia is Not Only the Gold Itself, but Also Highly Productive 
Russian Technologies. Why Then Are We Striving, as Usual, to Let 
the West Take Them Over?''] 
  [Text] There's talk going around about the slimming down of 
the Russian gold reserve. Be that as it may, it can be rather 
rapidly supplemented if the government would finally show some 
interest in the fate of our country's competitive technologies 
for the production of gold from its raw materials. Otherwise the 
know-how and inventions associated with them may become the 
booty of the nouveau riche and without hindrance will turn up 
abroad. The time has come to acknowledge that these technologies 
also constitute a ``gold reserve'' of Russia, strengthening its 
national economic security. It cannot be allowed that they share 
the fate of the nonferrous and rare metals which have floated 
abroad together with dollar earnings already exceeding 20 
billion rubles. 
  An obvious paradox of our time: the results of the 
scientific 
and technical activity of our country's scientists are being 
introduced in many regions of the world, but in Russia itself 
they either remain unused or are not used at the proper level. A 
fashionable variant of solution of economic, technical or other 
problems is becoming the turning sometimes not to the best, but 
only to foreign experience. The country may be seized by a sort 
of foreign far-sightedness in which we remain oblivious to our 
own scientific ``gold placers.'' 
  In a letter to the editor from Valeriy Golovin, entitled 
``Gold in Waste Heaps,'' published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on 9 
December 1993, he reported that the Mnogovershinnnyy Mineral 
Enrichment Combine in the Amur region when extracting gold and 
silver from ore on a regular basis dispatches to waste heaps up 
to 15% of the gold and up to 78% of the silver. As 
it was 
asserted in the publication, the lack of Russian technologies 
does not make possible the undertaking of any intensive 
exploitation of the Khakandzhin gold and silver deposit. The 
administration of Khabarovsk Kray links gold production plans 
for the immediate future only to reliance on the experience of 
foreign specialists. 
  Thus, a formula for success in the economic rebirth of 
different regions in Russia, seemingly attainable only by the 
use of foreign technologies, is being defined. But, truly, such 
a point of view can scarcely be elevated to the rank of a state 
policy. However, only those who are wearing the blinds of 
pro-Western far-sightedness fail to note that foreign companies 
usually offer for sale technologies which, to put it mildly, are 
of no economic value for their own countries. 
  However, the enormous interest which some foreign companies, 
unlike national producers, are manifesting in our competitive 
technologies, which in most cases until recently were kept 
completely secret, is logical. These technologies, 
understandably, can and must be an object of national pride, a 
truly golden Russian asset, the basis for the restoration of the 
national economy and civilized economic and scientific-technical 
cooperation with foreign countries. 
  One such technology was developed under the direction of 
Academician Boris Laskorin. This is a sorption leaching 
technology for extracting gold and silver from ores, the 
so-called ``resin in pulp'' method. Due to its universality and 
high efficiency it became the basis for developing technological 
schemes for the reworking of raw material containing gold from 
different deposits in the former USSR. Here the experience of 
production workers and the knowledge of the inventors of the 
technology were brought together. 
  Nowhere in the world is there raw material containing gold 
which is identical in its composition. And for this reason 
alone, even knowing the method itself, its optimum application 
is virtually impossible without the scientific-technical 
oversight of its inventors, a statement which can be made, 
however, relative to the use of any high technology. As is 
confirmed precisely by the situation prevailing at the 
Mnogovershinnyy Mineral Enrichment Combine, where the production 
workers through their own efforts probably could not accumulate 
that experience and knowledge which would be adequate for the 
optimum exploitation of the technology, which also evidently 
served as a reason for seeking assistance from abroad. 
  The many years of experience in using this technology 
confirms its high productive indices. For example, at the 
Muruntau gold production enterprise in the Kyzylkum alone, where 
the base technology with the participation of the inventors of 
the method was introduced as early as 1968, up to 94% of 
the 
gold is being extracted, and this in a deposit with an extremely 
low gold content. For richer ores the percentage of gold 
extraction is usually still higher. 
  In addition, a quarter century after its development the 
base 
technology is constantly being improved and has been perfected 
both in the laboratory and under commercial conditions at seven 
gold-producing enterprises in the former Soviet Union. The 
accumulated experience is unique and the new technological 
solutions are still protected as inventions. 
  Precisely Russian gold technology has opened the way to the 
production of gold from deposits regarded as poor, unsuited for 
commercial exploitation. After reexamining the conditions of 
gold and silver minerals, with allowance for use of the Boris 
Laskorin technology, the confirmed geological reserves of ore in 
gold-bearing deposits for their input into the economic cycle of 
the country increase in many cases by a factor of 10-12. Such 
deposits can be exploited at once, leaving for future 
generations the richer strategic geological gold and silver 
reserves. 
  Confirmation of the high competitiveness of our country's 
gold technology by foreign specialists became possible only 
after the stamp of secrecy was removed. The first publications 
on Russian technology for the complex reworking of gold-bearing 
raw material created broad interest throughout the world. When 
mineral exploiters became familiar with our method 
representatives of the leading companies of the gold-producing 
countries, that is, Great Britain, South Africa, United States, 
France and Brazil, as reported by Boris Laskorin, all gave the 
highest marks to the ``resin in pulp'' technology. To be sure, 
however, our know-how remained for them a commercial secret. 
  In turn, as long as this Russian method remained a secret 
foreign specialists used a different technology -- the so-called 
``charcoal in pulp'' method. A technical-economic comparison 
shows that the advantages of the ``resin in pulp'' method are 
indisputable in all respects: gold extraction is increased by 
5-12%, the expenditure of costly reagents, the time 
required 
for processing the raw material, amount of engineering equipment 
and consumption of electric power are all reduced. The capital 
expenditures on the construction of a plant also are 
considerably lower. 
  The leading gold producing companies in the world, being 
guided by the obvious economic advantages from use of the 
competitive Russian technology, are intelligently acquiring it, 
even giving up their own ambitions. Our technology, for example, 
already is being exploited by the British Lonro company in 
Zimbabwe; the national JCI company in South Africa also is close 
to this, in a contract with which the Ministry of Atomic Energy 
of the Russian Federation there is a provision for 
commercialization of the rights of the inventors of this 
technology as being intellectual property (know-how and 
inventions). A number of key gold producing companies of other 
foreign countries also are interested in economic cooperation 
and in these countries through the Soyuzpatent Patent Attorneys 
Association juridical protection of this technology is being 
ensured and the patent office in South Africa has issued a 
patent for it: a document giving exclusive rights to Russia in 
the territory of South Africa. 
  It is possible, to be sure, not to analyze and not to take 
note of this problem, but simply put in the hands of the market 
economy, which sooner or later will put everything in its place. 
But, possibly it is necessary that the interested federal 
control agencies in the Russian Federation pay heed to the 
prevailing situation with the use of high competitive 
technologies both in Russia and in the CIS countries and attempt 
to organize such a state scientific-technical, economic 
(investment, tax) and juridical strategy for a breakthrough, the 
fundamental thesis of which should be the fact that the gold 
reserve of the country and competitive gold extraction 
technologies constitute an important factor in the economic 
rebirth of Russia and the preservation of its national economic 
security. 
  A radical solution of this problem will serve as a basis for 
an attentive comparative analysis of that which is of value both 
in our country and abroad. It also probably can assist in 
extinguishing the Russian debt to foreign countries, which 
according to recent data exceeded the 60-billion dollar mark, 
not to mention the difficulties associated with debts within the 
country. But since debts must be paid off even today, a solution 
also must be found at once.

  [Abstract] During the past decade mumiye (MOV) has 
attracted both practical and scientific interest as a substance 
having healing properties. A requirement for the successful use 
of this substance lies in the determination of its authenticity. 
Mumiye is a complex biologically active substance having 60-80 
percent organic matter. Its structure has not yet been 
established, although it is known that the organic fraction 
contains low molecular components such as benzoic and hippuric 
acids and both oxy- and amino-acids, various oligomers 
(peptides, carbohydrates) polymers, proteins, polysaccharides, 
glycoproteins and their modifications, polyphenols, and others. 
The nature of the biological activity of this substance has not 
been determined and therefore its identification by content of 
biologically active components has thus far been avoided. Taking 
into account the extremely complex composition of mumiye and the 
lack of reliable information on the composition and nature of 
its biological activity, it is hypothesized that the most 
expedient way to resolve the problem of identification of this 
substance lies not in determining the quantitative content of 
individual components, but rather in some integrated physical 
chemical characterization of the substance as a whole, 
especially spectral. In the present work a systematic study was 
made of the infra-red spectra at 4000-400 cm[.sup]-1[/] of 50 
standard samples of authentic natural mumiye from deposits in 
Southwestern and Eastern Pamir, Eastern and Central Kazakhstan, 
Altay, and Tuva. Spectral criteria were established for 
identification of mumiye as a unique substance having a complex 
composition. A method is proposed for determining the 
authenticity of this substance from recommended spectral 
criteria making it possible to reliably identify mumiye and 
distinguish it from possible surrogates. Figure 1; references 4

  [Abstract] One of the most pressing problems in modern 
technology is cleaning working liquids from contamination. This 
problem cannot be resolved simply by pre-treating the liquid, 
owing to the presence of abrasives, chiefly in the form of 
ferromagnetic particles. The latter cause wear and lower the 
efficacy of the systems. Analysis of the principles involved in 
the filtration of such liquids indicates that the most simple 
and effective solution to this problem lies in the use of 
fibrous filter materials which are also carriers of a magnetic 
field. However, the mechanism of filtering liquids have not yet 
been sufficiently studied. Similar materials have not been 
widely disseminated owing to the lack of an economically 
feasible technology for forming elastic fibers from magnetically 
hard materials. In the present work data are presented on the 
filtration characteristics of polymeric fibrous materials which 
are also sources of a constant magnetic field. The materials 
were formed from a polymer melt filled with a magnetic substance 
by drawing out fibers with the aid of a gas stream, fastening 
the fibers to a substrate with adhesive, and subsequently 
treating it in a magnetic field. A well known extrusion-filler 
technology for making sheet fibrous polymeric materials was 
ineffective. The filters were tested with a model working liquid 
consisting of a petroleum oil containing arizona dust (fine 
grained powder of known particle size distribution) and barium 
ferrite as artificial contaminants. Filtration characteristics 
were assayed by photometric analysis of the liquids. The tests 
showed that the filters cause only an insignificant drop in 
filtration pressure while performing an almost uniform degree of 
purification to the working liquid. Another area of effective 
application of fibrous magnetic filter materials lies in the 
treatment of industrial and municipal effluents. A feature of 
these systems is the significant concentration of 
iron-containing contaminants which cause direct and progressive 
corrosion and wear to equipment, buildings, etc. Figures 2;

  [Abstract] Micro-quantities of organo-chlorine compounds in 
river water, often exceeding the maximum allowable 
concentration, ends up in drinking water, since communal water 
treatment facilities are not designed to remove them. A major 
portion of these organo-chlorine compounds originate from 
pesticides, even those which have not been used for several 
years since they gradually wash out from the ground water and 
enter the system. A secondary source of organo-chlorine 
compounds in potable water is side reactions of chlorine in 
water with aqueous humus and organic substances entering river 
water from ground water deposits. These include chloromethanes, 
polychlorophenols, and chlorophenolic acid. Experience in 
France, Germany, England, and USA shows that the single most 
dependable means for eliminating organo-chlorine compounds from 
drinking water is filtration through an activated charcoal, such 
as Filtrasorb-200 (Calgon Corp.) or Chemviron (Belgium). 
Satisfactory results have been obtained from an anthracitic 
charcoal produced in Ukraine, Akant-Mezo, developed at the 
Colloidal Chemistry and Hydrochemistry Institute. In the present 
work data are presented on total specific surface, meso-pore 
specific surface, and distribution of specific mesopore surface 
at radius limits of 1-4 nm in activated charcoals used in water 
treatment, KAD, AG-3, AG-PR, activated anthracite AUA, 
Akant-Mezo, and Filtrasorbs 100-400. From all indications, 
Akant-Mezo meets the requirements for deep treatment of water. 
Filtration of clear river water and tap water contaminated with 
hexachlorocyclohexane in concentrations of 35-43 micrograms per 
liter through a 0.3 meter column of Akant-Mezo, lowered the 
hexachlorocyclohexane concentration 350-400 times. The residual 
concentration was Û 0.1 microgram per liter. This meets the 
most rigid European standards for PDK of organo-chlorine 
pesticides in drinking water. References 13: 4 Russian, 9

  [Abstract] Electronic components used in communications and 
information handling are vulnerable to attack by molds. 
Polyurethane coatings obtained by hardening of industrial 
varnishes are readily contaminated with mold spores, especially 
in warm and moist air. Tributyl tin is an effective fungicide 
and tin-organic compounds are used as hardeners of polyurethane 
varnishes. Taking this into account, industrial grade varnish 
UR- 231 was modified with small quantities of tributyltin 
dichloromaleanate (DKhMO). This substance was synthesized by 
addition of tributyltin oxide to dichloromaleic acid. It has two 
biologically active groupings (the tributylstannyl group and a 
halogen at the double bond), each acting in a different 
fungicidal mechanism. This combination could intensify the 
activity of the compound through a synergistic effect. The 
LD[.sub]50[/] (acute oral toxicity for mice) is equal to 200 
mg per kg of the pure substance. DMKhO, being a trialkyltin 
carboxylate, also acts as a hardener for polyurethane resins. On 
hardening, this fungicide also becomes part of the composition 
of a macromolecular coating and provides structural biocidal 
protection. Bench tests demonstrated that the compound has 
satisfactory adhesion and electrical insulating resistance (over 
2 MOhms at 500 volts) which meets the standard. The test results 
also showed that varnish UR-231 modified with 0.1 percent DMKhMO 
has improved service properties for radio-electronic components 
and extends their use to tropical conditions. References 4: 1

  [Abstract] During pressure casting of filled polymeric 
compositions at high temperatures and mechanical stress, 
physical chemical processes may take place which could alter the 
properties of the end product. The degree of change to the end 
product is directly proportional to the intensity of the above 
processes. In order to obtain filled materials having optimum 
characteristics, such as anti-friction, for example, it is 
necessary to determine the amount of filler needed to provide 
the given properties to the material, taking to account the 
mutual effects of the system components during handling. In the 
present work a study was made of the effects of molybdenum 
sulfide content on the characteristics of polyarylate DV 
compositions (copolymer of diphenylolpropane and a mixture of 
iso- and terephthalic acids in the ratio 1:0.5:0.5). It was 
demonstrated that the thermal properties of pressure cast 
samples of polyarylate DV filled with MoS[.sub]2[/] vary with 
the filler content. Materials containing 15 percent 
MoS[.sub]2[/] have optimum properties as manifested in higher 
heat resistance of the ester bond in the polymer owing to the 
formation of a coordination bond between the carbonyl group and 
the MoS[.sub]2[/], and an increase in the thermo-oxidative 
stability of the filler. Increasing the MoS[.sub]2[/] content 
to 25 percent or more activates the decomposition of the 
isopropylydine groups, making it possible to form grafted 
branched polymer structures. Figures 2; references 4: 3 Russian,

  [Abstract] The achievements of recent research convincingly 
demonstrate that the possibilities for developing new ceramic 
materials having elevated service properties from oxides and 
their mixtures are far from being exhausted. Development of the 
theory of fritting, successes in powder technology, new 
technological solutions to the selection of modifying additives 
enhanced the development of theoretical foundations for directed 
synthesis of new ceramic materials having specific properties, 
improvements in existing technology and qualities of materials 
thereby significantly expanding the range of applications of 
ceramics. However, the problem of obtaining new high quality 
ceramic materials in domestic industry has not yet been fully 
solved, notwithstanding the need for developing a new generation 
of components. This situation results from the fact that oxide 
powders used for production of ceramics fail to meet modern 
requirements, since they are not uniform in particle size or 
shape and are aggregated and not evenly dispersed. Even with 
prolonged milling it is not possible to obtain powders with less 
than 1-2 microns particle size. Without special additives, it is 
not possible to make ceramics having controlled structures and 
optimal properties. Especially pressing is research on methods 
of preparing powders having a given degree of dispersion and the 
subsequent development of new types of ceramics from oxides 
having high service qualities, possible only through utilization 
of chemical methods of controlled preparation of powders and the 
use of special modifying additives. There is practically not a 
single type of high temperature oxide ceramic produced in our 
country that is directly suitable for fabricating high quality 
components. Research on the effect of powder structure on 
fritting, micro-structure, and ceramic properties made it 
possible to formulate a so-called ``ideal'' powder for making 
ceramics having optimal properties: aggregate size must not 
exceed one tenth of a micron, and they must have a spherical 
shape, not stick together and increase in size with time, and 
the distribution of components must be uniform throughout the 
bulk and surface of the particles. Some small enterprises have 
emerged in recent years which have initiated production of 
dispersed powders of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 
ZrO[.sub]2[/], and mixtures of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
with ZrO[.sub]2[/]. As a rule, these powders require 
additional milling, calcining, additives, and compacting. The 
technology of ceramics made from these powders is still at the 
research stage, costly, and not widely used. However, they are 
undoubtedly promising. A stable technology has been developed 
for making ceramics from partially stabilized zirconium dioxide 
from very pure powders using chemical precipitation, hydrostatic 
compression, and fritting in air at 1450-1550Î C. Durability 
of these ceramics is 750-900 MPa. They are monolithic in 
structure, less than one micron crystal size, and 
near-theoretical density. These ceramics consist of grains of a 
tetragonal solid solution, with the surfaces containing 
continuous thin-layered coatings of cubic solid solution. This 
inhibits crystal growth during fritting and enhances stability 
at high temperatures. The use of these unique ceramics could 
significantly improve the quality of components made from them.

analysis) was chosen as a research object in the development of 
structures intended for compaction by explosion of finely 
dispersed substances. The silicon dioxide was subjected to 
shock-wave treatment in steel and copper ampules containing an 
axially arranged charge of explosive. After the shock-wave 
treatment, the silicon dioxide was subjected to X-ray phase 
analysis and IR spectroscopy. The results demonstrated the 
existence of a new, previously unknown modification of silicon 
dioxide having a primitive cubic lattice (a = 7.78 angstroms).

  [Abstract] Hydrolytic copolycondensation of various 
organosilanes forms the basis for production of silicon-organic 
film formers for lacquers and enamels. Although this process has 
been used to produce an entire series of industrial paints 
varnishes, these products are somewhat inadequate in physical 
mechanical properties and resistance to organic solvents. These 
shortcomings are commonly overcome by modifying the 
silicon-organic film formers with organic polymers. Although 
this improves the physical mechanical properties, it also 
reduces the heat resistance of the products. Other ways to 
overcome this problem include improving structural ordering in 
the synthesized silicon-organic film formers by heterofunctional 
condensation of structurally organized oligomers, although this 
had limited success. In the present work a study was made of the 
synthesis of silicon-organic film formers using sodium 
oxyorganoalkoxysiloxanes. These universal reagents provide a new 
level for ordering structural organization of oligomers. This 
new approach may be used to develop production of a new 
generation of silicon-organic film formers. Figures 2;

  [Abstract] A partial list of some of the uses of ionite 
fibers includes treatment of drinking water, leaching of 
valuable components from effluents, removal of pollutants from 
air and gases, and treating electroplating effluents. However, 
the published data on ionite fibers is not systematized and 
often has a qualified character. This is especially true in the 
case of treating drinking water, where several heavy metal ions 
may be present simultaneously. In the present work the 
quantitative characteristics of the adsorption of copper ions 
from aqueous solutions on VION KN-1 (sodium form) chemosorption 
fiber, and the sorption capacity of the fiber under both static 
and dynamic conditions were determined in the case of aqueous 
solutions containing also mixtures of copper, lead and 
manganese. Figures 2; references 7 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Tire cord is presently still being produced in 
the classical method which includes filament making, stretching 
and pre-twisting, twisting, and weaving. The stretching and 
twisting operations are carried out on type KV-III-250 KA 
twisting-stretching machines and on the single process KO-228 
twisting machine. These obsolete, noisy, and difficult to 
maintain machines operate at low speeds not exceeding 177 meters 
per minute with 2.85 kg packets being produced. The NPO 
``Khimtekstilmash'' and the Chernigov PO ``Khimvolokno'' 
developed a new process to produce single wound tire cord. The 
process includes four sequential operations: forming the 
filament, stretching, twisting, and weaving it. The stretching 
and twisting operations are carried out on new high-output 
machines, winding-stretching machine NV-400-KT24M and twisting 
machine KD-600-IK. The new process turns out high strength 
single wound capron filament for production of grade 35KNTS-O 
tire cord. Figures 2.

  [Abstract] Sorption-active fibers and fabrics made from 
them play a special part in environmental control. This part is 
determined by the high sorption capability and rates in mass 
exchange and low hydro- and aerodynamic resistance of these 
materials. Graft polymerization of ionogenic monomers and 
chemical conversion of functional groups in grafted chains are 
the most common methods for preparing chemosorbing fibers. To 
prepare various types of such fibrous materials, graft 
polymerization of radicals to fibers having various chemical 
structures have been developed--hydrocellulose, polycaproamide 
with redox systems as ionogenic, and non-ionogenic 
(acrylonitrile, glycidyl methacrylate). These methods make it 
possible to conduct graft polymerization with practically no 
homopolymer formation at high process rates and under 
ecologically clean conditions. Chemo-sorbing fibrous materials 
having ion exchange and complex forming properties were prepared 
by chemical conversion of functional groups (epoxy, nitrile) on 
grafted copolymers. In the present work a brief characterization 
of the results of using these fibers and fabrics made from them 
to resolve ecological problems in various areas is presented. 
Covered are fibers made from grafted cellulose and 
polycaproamide fibers containing hydrazide groups to adsorb 
heavy metal ions, the sorption activities of fabrics in respect 
to sulfur dioxide, sorbents for radionucleides, and 
sorption-active carbon fiber materials. The latter may be used 
to adsorb petroleum products from water. Figures 3; references

  [Abstract] The domestically produced high-strength and heat 
resistant fiber having the trade name ``Terlon,'' as well as the 
well known Kevlar (USA) and Tvaron (Netherlands), is a 
para-aramide fiber. Terlon is as good as the foreign analogs in 
physical properties. At the present time Terlon is being 
produced on an experimental basis as a high-strength fiber, both 
long and short staple. Terlon is said to be superior to the 
Kevlar and Tvaron in having a lower (5-10 percent) density, 
higher bonding strength to rubber for tire cord, and better 
fibrillation for making pulp. According to data from the Gorky 
Labor Hygiene and Occupation Disease SRI, Terlon polymer has no 
irritating, sensitizing, or fibrogenic action and therefore its 
maximum allowable concentration has been set at 10 mg per cubic 
meter (equivalent to inert dust). The present work lists the 
many places where Terlon fiber may be substituted to provide 
environmentally beneficial effects. For example it may be used 
in radial tires, as a reinforcement in conveyer belts (in place 
of steel), and in the manufacture of heat and fire resistant 
special clothing for welders, metallurgists, and firemen. Short 
staple fiber and pulp made of Terlon may also be used in place 
of asbestos in brake mechanisms, gaskets, and fillers.

  [Abstract] Under the leadership of Academician G. I. 
Kudryavtsev, the Scientific Production Association 
``Khimvolokno'' developed the high strength aramide fibers SVM 
and Armos. Changes in industry made it possible to distribute 
these products and thereby resolve ecological problems. Aramide 
fibers have a unique complex of properties making them 
ecologically attractive. In addition to being strong and 
resilient, they are heat resistant at temperature intervals to 
250-270Î C, resist bending, and have good textile 
properties. These properties make them very promising for use as 
filtration materials, especially for hot gases. The cyclones 
used for this purpose until recently, are suitable only for 
pre-filtering. In the present work the use of aramide fabric 
filters to treat hot gases to remove coal ash is discussed. Test 
results indicate that the new aramide materials are promising.

  [Abstract] The need to develop low cost carbon sorbents 
caused a rise in interest in the use carbon fibers made from 
pitch for this purpose. Compared to carbon fibers made from 
acrylonitrile or viscose, these fibers are made from a low cost 
and readily available source using an effective fiber-forming 
method (from a melt) and an ecologically clean method of 
production of the carbon fiber at high (75-80 percent) product 
yield, and the possibility of developing a fully mechanized 
technological stream of high unit capacity. A simple and 
effective method for activating carbon fibers made from pitch 
has been developed under laboratory conditions. An experimental 
set-up, developed for studying the dynamic characteristics of 
the sorption process on activated fibers, was used to study the 
porosity of the fibers (pore volume, specific surface, and pore 
size distribution). Based on this study, the process was 
optimized for producing sorbent samples capable of sorbing up to 
600 mg benzene per gram of fiber. Pore size of the samples did 
not exceed 35 Angstroms, the average being 10-15 Angstroms. The 
fiber has a strong activity towards both polar and non-polar 
substances: benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, acetone, and ethyl 
cellosolve. The goal of further research will focus on the 
development of a technological process for activating 
carbonaceous materials made from pitch and its related equipment 
design.

  [Abstract] Safeguarding the air and water media from 
harmful substances is a pressing problem, especially in regard 
to compounds of sulfur, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and other 
toxic substances. Chemosorption on fibrous materials has evolved 
as the preferred method for removal of these substances. These 
fibers may be produced by: a) graft polymerization of active 
monomers capable of chemosorption to a finished monomer; b) 
forming a fiber from a copolymer containing chemically active 
groups; c) forming a fiber from a mixture of polymers containing 
chemosorbing groups. However, the output of these fibers by all 
known methods does not exceed several tons annually, and the 
immediate task consists of developing broad scale production of 
these materials in so far as experience indicates their 
undisputed advantages in resolving problems in safeguarding the 
environment. At the same time, the assortment of chemosorbent 
fibers should be broadened to include oxidation-reduction groups 
and groups capable of selective sorption. The report [sic] also 
discusses experimental data on the use of the chemosorptive 
fiber Vion for sorption of pollutants from industrial effluents. 
Results are presented on the testing of protective clothing 
which has good moisture and air breathing qualities, but is also 
impermeable to chemically active substances such as acids.

  [Abstract] Trans-cyclohexanocrown esters are macrocyclic 
ligands having complex-forming properties which can be regulated 
by introducing variously orientated substituents at the 
cyclohexane fragment of the molecule. The possibility of such 
regulating is due to the change in relative stability of the two 
conformers (A and B) during a change in conformational energy of 
an alkyl substituent (R) in the molecule. The macrocycle in 
conformer B is much more susceptible to formation of complexes 
with cations than the extended macrocycle in conformer A. This 
has been confirmed experimentally: the addition of inorganic 
salts to solutions of the trans-cyclohexanocrown esters in 
CD[.sub]3[/]OD and (CD[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]CO results 
in an equilibrium shift in conformer IB. The regulating role of 
substituent R consists of destabilizing the IB-cation complex, 
which becomes intensified with an increase in conformational 
energy of the substituent. In the present work the 
trans-cyclohexanodithiocrown ester homologous series was 
synthesized from corresponding trans-1,2-cyclohexanodiols. The 
ratio of conformers to one another was determined by PMR from 
the synthesis products. It was demonstrated that the position of 
conformational equilibrium is determined by the size and 
structure of the macrocycle and by the volume of the substituent 
in the alicyclic fragment. References 11: 8 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Experimental results are presented from studies 
of spectral and temporal characteristics of chromium and 
neodymium ion laser radiation in various media. The author 
obtained the results in a number of experiments using one 
experimental setup and identical conditions. This was done to 
eliminate the effect of technical perturbations of the 
resonator. The qualitative difference in the behavior of the 
free generation of chromium and neodymium ions suggests a 
physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating radiation 
pulsations in lasers using ions with an external working shell 
linked with the spallation of the working levels of the ions in 
their own radiation field. It is unambiguously found that 
chromium ion lasers, in contrast to neodymium ion lasers, have a 
distinct physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating 
pulsation of radiation intensity. Any mechanism associated with 
spatial interaction of modes in the active medium is ruled out. 
The difference in the lasers is ascribed to the great difference 
in the structure of the ions' working levels. The electric field 
of the laser radiation which arises in the active medium will 
affect only chromium ions, leading to further spallation of the 
working levels due to the dynamic Stark effect. When the field 
in the active medium is spatially inhomogeneous, a standing wave 
is formed whose spatial structure is altered during generation. 
The Stark effect leads to modulation of intensity over time and 
nonattenuating pulsations in intensity. When the spatial 
inhomogeneity of the field in the active medium is smoothed, 
this intensity modulation disappears. This conclusion was 
verified experimentally using titanium lasers. It may also be 
concluded that free generation of all rare earth ions in various 
media should occur in quasi-stationary mode without the need to 
smooth the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in the active 
medium. Figures 6; references 44, 33 Russian, 11 Western.

  [Abstract] For optimizing the reallocation of 
two-dimensional arrays in a supercomputer memory, algorithms are 
constructed which minimize the number of simultaneous data 
transfers for executing nests of cycles such as transposition of 
a matrix. The memory is assumed to consist of p segments so that 
p simultaneous data acquisitions or p simultaneous data 
retrievals are possible, program fragments being considered here 
which contain arrays with indices linearly dependent on the 
cycle counters I and J. The reallocation problem is thus reduced 
to synthesis of a parallel algorithm for fastest execution of 
the two-dimensional cycle DO 1 J = 0,N 
  DO 1 I = 0,M 1 Y(I,J) = 
Y(I,J)= X(a*I + b*J + c, a1*I + b1*J + c1) involving two 
orthogonally disposed arrays Y and X. It must be kept in mind 
here that, unlike distribution of data, allocation of data does 
not indicate into which cell J of a memory segment a given array 
element I will move. The problem is solved for N= M= p- 1 and 
two specific cases. The first case is a fully accessible 
commutator with p inputs and p outputs which can be connected to 
one another, the simplest one being such a commutator where at 
some instant of time one input can be connected to only one 
output, while simultaneously another input can be connected to 
another output. The second case is a ring network facilitating 
simultaneous transfers but only those which correspond to cyclic 
shifts, namely permutations _s_ such that (_s_[.sub]i[/]- i) 
mod p = _s_[.sub]j[/] mod p for any i,j in respective 1,...,p 
sets. The reallocation algorithms involve deparallelization of 
cycles and are validated by three lemmas: 1) when a,b,p are 
natural numbers, then there exists a number t such that GCD(a + 
t*b,p)= GCD.(a,b,p)= 1; 2) when a,b,c are integers, then t can 
be any number in the set of integers; 3) for any integers b and 
p there exist integers t and s such that t*b + s*p= GCD(b,p) and 
t is the reciprocal of p (GCD - greatest common divisor). 
Following rigorous proofs of these lemmas, respective algorithms 
are applied to reallocation of an array in a multiprocessor 
computer system with either a universal commutator or with a 
ring network. Theorems are then proved, with the aid of an 
appropriate fourth lemma each, which define the least number of 
transfers necessary for simultaneously executing a nest of 
cycles DO 1 L = 0,p- 1 1 
A(u*I + v, u1*I + v1)= B(a*I + b, a1*I + b1) over a universal 
commutator and over ring network respectively. This number is 
p*d in the first case with d= GCD(a,b,p) and p or 
p[.sup]2[/]/q in the second case, q being the largest divisor 
of c/GCD(a,b,c)= GCD(a,b,c)/b and each transfer being a shift. 
Transposition of a two-dimensional p-order matrix p in 
accordance with the appropriate algorithm is demonstrated on a 
binary cycle DO 1 J = 0,p-1 
  DO 1 I= 0,p-1 1 Y(I,J) = 
X(J,I) equivalent to a DO 1 L = 0,p-1 
  DO 1 I = 0,p-1 1 
Y((I,(I+L) mod p) = X((I+L) mod p,I) cycle. References 7.

  [Abstract] An input register module in the FASTBUS standard 
has been developed for recording coordinates in a multichannel 
hodoscope and their subsequent transfer into a buffer memory, 
this 2x32-bit F65588 device being much faster and ``deeper'' 
than the existing F6585 4-bit shift register. The module built 
with K500 series microcircuits includes two differential 
receivers, two input registers, and two sequentially operating 
memories. The first register stores the leading edge of clock 
signal pulses and then transfers it to the W[.sub]e[/]memory, 
whereupon the second register stores the trailing edge of clock 
signal pulses and then transfers it to the C[.sub]s[/] 
memory. In this way the recording speed is doubled and the 
resolving time is halved. Both memories operate in the mode of 
data storing with the W[.sub]e[/] and C[.sub]s[/] 
recording signals put in the constant resolving state by means 
of a reset signal coming from the front panel. Addressation is 
done in Gray codes by two corresponding binary counters, with 
subsequent recoding by means of exclusive OR logic 
and with a register on the output side which eliminates the 
possibility of data being sent to the wrong address during a 
change of address. A trigger signal indicates when an event 
takes place. The module includes also two delay counters, a 
remarkable feature thus being the possibility of presetting the 
time delay between that trigger signal and the beginning of data 
recording. In this way data can be recorded both before and 
after the trigger signal, which makes it possible to also record 
the ``history'' preceding an event. Readout of data from the 
FASTBUS trunk is effected by means of a 2x4 decoder with one 
input and four outputs, both memories having been partitioned 
into two segments each and a CSRO register generating an FB 
reset signal which is then combined in the OR mode with the 
reset signal from the front panel. Multiplexing of output 
signals is done by combining the respective memory outputs in 
the inclusive OR mode and by using the control inputs 
of the C[.sub]s[/] memory, to which resolving signals are 
sent by the decoder. The author thanks A.G. Litvinenko for 
helpful discussions and for evaluating the necessary parameters, 
also V.I. Maksimenkova and D.P. Mikhalev for assisting in 
assembly and adjustments of the module. Figures 2; references 2.

  [Abstract] During the 1984-92 period the Institute of Radio 
Engineering and Electronics at the Russian Academy of Sciences 
intensified research in the field of quantum electronics, the 
three main areas being: 
1) fiber- optics technology, 
2) laser materials and devices, 
3) spectroscopy based on nuclear-magnetic resonance or on 
luminescence. 
  In the first area have been for the first time developed: 
a) a method of extruding single-mode fibers with sheaths made of 
fluorine-doped quartz glass for 1.3-1.55 Êm infrared light 
b) a new technology for producing anisotropic single-mode fibers 
which maintain the polarization and the intensity of light with 
minimal losses 
c) a laboratory technology for producing single-mode fibers 
which transmit 1.3 Êm light with an only 0.7 dB/km maximum 
loss 
d) a method of welding together different fibers with an only 
0.5 dB loss per joint. In addition to improvement of the 
extruding apparatus, there have been developed a plasmochemical 
variant of vertical lateral deposition for glass-forming oxides 
with use of organometallic compounds as initial reactants, a 
method of producing large-aperture fibers, a method of producing 
low-loss multimode fibers. A new method of forming anisotropic 
``bow tie'' fibers, with the aid of thermal shields, has been 
proposed and demonstrated. A high magnetic susceptibility of 
single-mode fibers has been attained by use of using rare-earth 
elements as dopants. For the first time has been developed a 
tubeless method of lateral deposition of thin fluorosilicate 
sheaths on quartz rods in a microwave plasma. Jointly with the 
Institute of Optical Physics and the Scientific Research 
Institute of Electrical Systems at the Ministry of Electrical 
Industry have been produced radiation-resistant power fibers, 
radiation-resistant and mechanically strong single-mode and 
multimode fibers, thick fiber strands for optical cables, and 
large-aperture low-loss fibers doped with various rare-earth 
elements as well as large-aperture quartz-quartz fibers for 
transmitting up to 500 W of laser radiation power with 80% 
efficiency. Other developments include deposition of polymer 
sheaths, new silicon elastomers for fiber coatings which will 
ensure at least 99% transmission, and a cryogenic 
microcable 
for temperatures from 80ÎC down to -60ÎC. Theoretical 
studies have yielded a theory of microflexure and a new model of 
hydrolytic fracture of quartz fibers. New apparatus with 
fiber-optic components for measuring physical quantities and 
methods of doing it have also been developed, the components 
including fiber thermooptic channel switches, Fourier analyzers, 
a random-access memory, polarizers, light modulators, two-mode 
reflectometers, directional couplers, temperature and magnetic 
field transducers. Work has furthermore been done on several 
practical applications of fiber-optic technology. In the area of 
laser materials and devices there have been developed a method 
of hardening phosphate glass, a new Cr-Y-Er glass for 
heat-resistant minilasers and high-efficiency low- threshold 
quatrons, a 1.5 Êm Er-minilaser suitable for a record high 7 
Hz pulse repetition rate, borate glass activated with Yb and Er. 
There also have for the first time been achieved parametric 
resonance emission of ultraviolet picosecond pulses and 
continuous high-efficiency emission by Nd ions. Other new 
developments include powder lasers (Nd-ion implanted in powders 
of La oxide or oxysulfide, binary Na, La, Ba, or Gd chromate- 
molybdate, La-Sr niobate, and Ga-Yb sulfide with Nd impurity), a 
new kind of mirrors using resonant metal screens for optically 
pumped lasers, a highly long-time stable 
CO[.sub]2[/]-OsO[.sub]4[/], and diffusely reflecting 
coatings (aluminum, fused quartz, phosphate glass) for laser 
reflectors, also a new method of hardening phosphate glass for 
active media and a new method of welding together glasses 
containing chromium. The feasibility of producing fibers for 
high-efficiency transmission of infrared light has been proposed 
on the basis of theoretical analysis and then demonstrated 
experimentally on fibers transmitting 1.5 Êm at an average 
power of 2 W with an up to 30 % efficiency. With 
low-energy 
ultraviolet lasers, efficient frequency conversion by stimulated 
Raman scattering has been achieved in a multipass vessel 
containing methane under a pressure of 30 atm. Research was done 
on both electron-magnetic resonance and nuclear- magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, studies of the latter having revealed a 
``cascade'' narrowing of the NMR spectra owing to concurrent 
action of a strong radio-frequency field and slow molecular 
movements in solids. As to generators of electromagnetic 
signals, there have been developed microminiature microwave 
vacuum devices including solid-state oscillators such as 
transistors, avalanche diodes, and Gunn-effect diodes. More than 
80 scientific articles have been published during that period.

  [Abstract] A new two-position optical lightguide switch has 
been developed. The new switch is smaller and faster than 
conventional optical switches based on electro-optical and 
electro-acoustic effects. Specifically, the switch has a 
relatively high speed, high beam deflection (on the order of 
30Î), and low (no more than 0.1 W) control signal power. It 
consists of a lightguide that serves as a common channel, has 
the customary core and sheath, and is positioned coaxially with 
a second lightguide. The plane of the exit end of the first 
lightguide is sloped to its axis at at angle of 
(_ps_-„)/2-_P_, 
and the plane of the entry end of the second lightguide is 
normal to its axis. Alongside the second lightguide is a third 
lightguide whose axis is sloped to the axis of the first two 
lightguides at some angle _a_. As is the case for the second 
lightguide, the entry end of the third lightguide is plane and 
normal to its axis. The exit end of the first lightguide is 
located some distance from the entry ends of the second and 
third lightguides and forms an air gap. The lower part of the 
gap is filled with an immersion fluid whose refractive index 
n[.sub]1[/]' is selected to equal the refractive index of the 
core n[.sub]1[/]. The amount of liquid is such that its 
surface is below the lightguides' core. The path of radiation 
entering and leaving the first lightguide is determined by 
whether or not the fluid in the air gap expands to fill the 
entire gap, thus blocking access to the entrance end of the 
second lightguide. The fluid's expansion is in turn dictated by 
the temperature to which the fluid is heated. The influence of 
the capillary effect that is inevitable given the dimensions of 
the lightguides used in fiber-optic communication is eliminated 
by filling the space under the fluid with air at a positive 
pressure of 1.5-2 atm. In addition to eliminating any capillary 
effect, this positive pressure also helps accelerate 
displacement of the fluid to its initial position after the 
heating has ceased. Quartz lightguides with a refractive index 
of 1.48 may be used for all three lightguides, and ordinary 
anhydrous glycerin with a refractive index of 1.478 may be used 
as the immersion fluid. The serviceability of the new switch as 
a common, coaxial, and side channel was confirmed experimentally 
by using lightguides with a core diameter of 200 Êm. It was 
stressed that the immersion fluid need not be vaporized in order 
for the switch to be serviceable; heating to temperatures of 
50-70ÎC is sufficient to increase the fluid's initial volume 
sufficiently so that it will reach the top level. Such 
temperatures may be reached in only 10-20 ns with a pulse energy 
of no more than 10 ÊJ, which is easily accomplished by using 
widely available semiconductor lasers. Figure 1; references 2 
(Russian).

  [Abstract] The criteria for statistical optimization of the 
power engineering of the adaptive sections of wideband 
vacuum-tube oscillators not containing automatic load-matching 
systems were considered. The operating algorithm of the system 
considered was geared toward maximum output power and electronic 
efficiency of the terminal section of the transmitter by 
establishing the optimum excitation voltage in the vacuum tube's 
control grid and optimal plate supply voltage at which the 
oscillator's dynamic range is fully utilized. Working 
measurements of an actual vacuum tube's electrical operating 
modes served as the starting data. First a generalized 
mathematical model of the oscillator stage was developed. The 
optimal resistance of the vacuum-tube oscillator's load was 
calculated. The third stage of the statistical analysis 
consisted of a computer simulation of a vacuum-tube oscillator 
based on a GU-92B tetrode that was connected in a circuit with a 
common cathode and operated in a class B mode for a randomly 
mismatched load. The analysis established that the greater the 
uncertainty of the impedance of the antenna-feed section of the 
transmitter, the higher the the energy gain obtained by adapting 
the oscillator's mode to the load mismatch. This design decision 
was thus recommended for use when designing items such as 
wideband shortwave and ultrashortwave radio transmitters for 
mobile equipment with short antennas where frequency 
irregularity and time instability of input impedance are both 
very significant. Figures 2; references 4 (Russian).

  [Abstract]This article examines theoretical models that 
calculate the parameters of distributed (nonlocal) feedback 
optical lasers. The effective Q-factor approach used was 
asymptotically accurate, which made it possible to reduce the 
description of distributed feedback laser generation to a simple 
system of balance equations with concentrated parameters. The 
features of laser generation with light induced stochastic 
distributed feedback are examined. Optical bistability and 
generation of ultrashort pulses are possible, which reduces the 
threshold. Explicit equations are obtained which are suitable 
for practical evaluation of parameters in ultrashort pulse 
generation. An overview of experimental results is presented 
with analysis of the features and advantages of using 
distributed feedback lasers as sources of optical ultrashort 
pulses. Figures 15; references 104: 62 Russian, 42 Western.

  [Abstract] This article examines two problems in the 
propagation of laser radiation in a distributed feedback system: 
noise conversion and determination of the conditions in which it 
is possible to take quantum nondisruptive measurements (with 
Bragg diffraction) and experiment with the induction of 
hydrodynamic instabilities by light convection (Rayleigh-Benard) 
in an anisotropic liquid (classic examination). Emphasis is 
placed on the possibility of observing these fundamental states 
in the field of high-coherence stable continuous lasers. This is 
important in the development of optical computers and 
biocomputers. References 56: 41 Russian, 15 Western.

  [Abstract] a third variant of the method of 
shift formulas for design of asymmetric planar optical 
waveguides is proposed, two variants of this method having 
already been described (V.V. Shevchenko; RADIOTEKHNIKA I 
ELEKTRONIKA, Vol. 31 No. 5, May 86). Unlike the _a_-method of 
transverse waves and the k-method of wave numbers, this 
k_a_-method yields a complete expansion of a mode field into 
modes of a reference waveguide. This method is demonstrated on 
the TE-mode in a waveguide with a nonhomogeneous guiding layer 
between two different homogeneous outer layers. As the 
equivalent reference waveguide for comparative evaluation is 
used one with a homogeneous guiding layer, as is being done in 
the other two methods. The field function is obtained from the 
appropriate wave equations by the usual procedure. The resulting 
equation for the amplitude of the transverse electric field 
component is then used for both approximate analytical and exact 
numerical calculation of the key waveguide parameters such as 
the critical frequencies and the propagation constants, also the 
spectral parameter. For illustration is considered a waveguide 
for surface waves with a guiding layer which has a truncated 
exponential profile of dielectric permittivity. All those key 
parameters of its modes have been calculated for various values 
of the exponent q, to confirm the expediency of this method. 
Approximate (analytical) calculations may as well be made by the 
_a_-method, inasmuch as the k_a_ method does not refine the 
results within the entire 0 Ú q &gt;  Ï range of the 
exponent. 
Exact (numerical) calculations for surface waveguides as well as 
for embedded ones should, however, made by the k_a_ method.

  [Abstract] Possible resonance interactions of electron 
beams and the high-frequency field in open periodic waveguiding 
electrodynamic structures are examined, quasi-optical such 
structures being considered for propagation of electromagnetic 
waves shorter than the period of these structures. One known 
possible interaction is that of a relativistic electron beam and 
only the field of the first harmonic (fundamental component) of 
such a structure, their interaction being attended by large 
diffraction losses tolerable only in ultrahigh-power devices. 
Another known possible interaction is that of an electron beam 
and space harmonics of the periodic structure generated on the 
inside surface of the waveguide rings, in which case one can 
always minimize diffraction losses by optimizing the dimensions 
of the waveguide segments. A third possible interaction now 
under investigation is that of a relativistic electron beam and 
an oversize waveguide with a retarding structure placed on its 
inside surface. The possibility of electromagnetic radiation 
being amplified during resonance interaction of a relativistic 
electron beam and the field of space harmonics in an open 
waveguide line is demonstrated theoretically, of interest being 
radiation wavelengths much smaller than the waveguide period. As 
a specific case is considered a planar quasi-optical waveguide 
with a large period 2D on one side and structures with a small 
period d on periodically spaced mirrors. The efficiency of this 
interaction is calculated analytically in the Fresnel 
approximation and then compared with that of conventional 
interaction where the period of the retarding structure is 
comparable with the radiation wavelength. It is shown that 
resonance interaction in such a system is possible even under 
less stringent design constraints on the electrodynamic 
structure with a small period d, the Fresnel parameter however 
depending on the interaction mode and can be as large as twice 
the number of space harmonics of the 2D period. Therefore, 
achieving significant interaction output in such a system 
requires special means of minimizing diffraction losses. Figures 
1; references 6.

  [Abstract] This article presents a solution (using the 
integrals method) to the two-dimensional problem of the 
diffraction of an electromagnetic wave on an ideally conducting 
infinite cylinder partially covered with a dielectric. Inside 
the cylinder are thin resistive strips of finite conductivity. 
It is assumed that the contours of the cross section of the 
cylinder, coating, and strips are of an arbitrary form. The 
diffraction of anE- and H-polarized 
electromagnetic wave is considered. The results show a possibly 
substantial effect of the strips on the scattering 
characteristics of metal-dielectric cylinders in a resonant 
range. The algorithms described here make it possible to study a 
structure with varied electrophysical strip parameters along the 
cross section contour. The electron paramagnetic resonance may 
be reduced by 10-15 dB without changing the weight a nd size of 
metal-dielectric cylinders. Figures 5; references 11: 10

  [Abstract] This article examines the absorption of infrared 
radiation in a periodic structure, a thin corrugated metal film 
on a dielectric substrate. 
Absorption in this structure increases sharply, reaching unity. 
The increase in absorption is due to resonant excitation in a 
system of surface electromagnetic waves. The amount of 
absorption depends significantly on the ratio of intrinsic and 
radiative attenuation. The substrate is necessary to reach high 
absorption values. The substrate parameters and the angle of 
incid ence of the external wave are determined. The scattering 
of a plane p-polarized monochromatic wave incident 
from vacuum at an angle on a metal-dielectric film is studied.

  [Abstract] A method of determining the value of the complex 
propagation constant for a surface electromagnetic wave is 
proposed which does not require kno wledge of the 
electrophysical parameters of the studied material. The material 
studied in this article is a rectangular plane- parallel plate 
with a length of no less than two wavelengths and a width 
smaller than a wavelength. The material is placed i n a UHF 
field and rotated in the horizontal plane around its minor axis. 
The signal scattered by the material (in the form of the 
reflected beam pattern) is recorded. Irradiation of the material 
with an electromagnetic wave along its long side generates a 
surface wave that creates maximum reflection in near 
longitudinal directions. In the reflected beam pattern a 
distinctiv e main lobe of the surface wave appears which can be 
used to calculate the complex propagation constant for the 
material. The lobe is near parabolic, which is sufficient to 
determine effective scattering area values. It is much simpler 
to determine the complex propagation constant using this method.

  [Abstract] This article describes a method of monitoring 
the linearity of opto-electronic channels used in superweak 
electromagnetic field reception systems operating in photon 
count mode. The method is based on control sources of radiation 
with known (Poisson) photon statistics and comparison with the 
photon count statistics at the channel output. This method was 
used in absolute measurement of the quantum efficiency of 
photoreceptors using spontaneous parametric scattering. The 
advantage of this method is the simplicity of the equipment. A 
simple comparison method is visual comparison of histograms. An 
algorithm is developed to improve upon the comparison. This 
method is suitable for the measurement of the limits of 
linearity of opto-electronic channels and operational 
monitoring. Figures 2; references 4 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Electromagnetic waves in the centimeter range 
are scattered from the sea surface on small ripples under 
conditions of Bragg resonance. In a two-scale model, large-scale 
waves lead to spatial and temporal modulation of the amplitude 
of the radar signal due to a change in the local scattering 
angle, and to phase modulation associated with the orbital 
velocities of surface elements. This article describes a method 
of studying the Doppler spectrum of a radar signal with a 
frequency up to 20 GHz scattered by the sea surface. It is 
possible to obtain information on the fine structure of the 
Doppler spectrum associated with resonant scattering on 
gravitational-capillary ripples in digital processing of the 
received signal. It is also possible to evaluate the effect of 
large waves with a period of several seconds. A numerical fast 
Fourier transform algorithm was used to obtain the radar signal 
spectrum. The stable fine structure of the spectrum is provided 
by ``sliding'' averaging. Digital data processing may be done in 
real time, so the method is suitable for comprehensive studies 
of sur face phenomena. Figures 2; references 9: 6 Russian, 3 
Western.

  [Abstract] An expression is derived which links the input 
resistance of a symmetric two-sided slot antenna on a circular 
infinitely long metal cone and the excited vertex with the input 
resistance of a metal vibrator whose shape and dimensions 
coincide with those of the slot. The input resistance of the 
slot and metal vibrators on a cone and pyramid are calculated 
with a method based on calculation of the wave resistance of a 
homogeneous line of infinite length. A radiator placed along the 
edges of a pyramid is easier to implement th an a conical 
radiator in the shortwave range or at lower frequencies. The 
conical and pyramidal radiators examined here have a constant 
and purely active input resistance, which provides a high 
matching level. If the radiator has finite dimensions, the range 
of frequencies is limited, but still rather wide. Figures 4;

  [Abstract] The fundamental physical properties of two 
low-dimensional structures are studied: quasi-one-dimensional 
conductors and Langmuir-Blodgett films. These are new materials 
that are promising for use in nanoelectronics and molecular 
electronic s. A new condensed state is formed in 
quasi-one-dimensional conductors: a charge density wave. The 
energy spectrum of one-p article and collective excitations in 
this state are determined. The properties of the mechanisms of 
electric conductivity and dielectric permittivity of 
quasi-one-dimensional conductors are studied in a wide range of 
temperatures and electric fields. Conducting Langmuir-Blodgett 
films are manufactured and studied. The films are made of a 
mixture of amphophilous donor and acceptor molecules. The 
optimal composition of the mixture is determined from the point 
of view of conductivity and film stru cture. The conductivity 
activation energy is found, as well as the Hall mobility and 
type of current carrier. A sharp reversible change in film 
resistance is observed during heating, which is caused by 
reversible changes in the structure. Mechanisms of film 
conductivity are discussed on the basis of the results. Figures

  [Abstract] The main problem in building powerful 
electromagnetic pulse generators is the construction of the 
wideband transition from the coaxial generator channel, which is 
filled with an electric insulation medium, to an asymmetric 
bandline with air insulation. The transition between the 
symmetric and asymmetric sections has the minimum possible cross 
section while retaining electric stability. This insures minimal 
distortion of the leading edge of the pulse between the 
symmetric and asymmetric portions. The wave channel of the 
generator was studied using pulse reflectometry. Local 
distortions were found to be no greater than 15%. The 
band line 
has an amplitude of up to 500 kV/m (1.3 kA/m) and a edge length 
of no greater than 0.5 ns. As a comparison,the Swiss GTEM 1500 
installation forms pulses with a edge length of 1.5 ns and an 
amplitude of 24 kV/m (24/377 kA/m). Figures 3; references 8: 7

<F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Prikhodko, deputy science director of </F>
Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of Molecular 
Electronics and the ``Mikron'' Plant, Anatoliy Skvirya, director 
of ``Silikon'' Scientific Production Enterprise, and Aleksandr 
Sokolov, vice president of ``Sikikon'' by Nataliya Lazareva, 
DELOVOY MIR correspondent; place and date not given: 
``Micro-electronics--A Spark of Hope''] 
  [Text] Many people are now concerned about the situation at 
industrial micro-electronics enterprises, among other places at 
plants and scientific research institutes of Zelenograd 
(Russia's ``Silicon Valley''). It is here that a host of 
problems have arisen associated with defense conversion, 
high-tech advances, development of a market for 
information-related products, and of course, these problems are 
becoming especially acute in connection with the privatization 
of these businesses. It seems that enterprises of this kind are 
tottering on the edge of extinction due to the comparatively 
intense influx of Western information technology into Russia and 
bordering nations, which is quite natural, given that we are so 
dreadfully far behind in this area. Bankruptcy, outside leasing, 
or sale of premises and hands to foreign companies--is this the 
end? 
  Our correspondent Nataliya Lazareva talks with the deputy 
science director of Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of 
Molecular Electronics and the ``Mikron'' Plant, Pavel Prikhodko. 
Also taking part in the discussion were representatives of the 
small scientific production enterprise ``Silikon'': its director 
Anatoliy Skvirya and vice president Aleksandr Sokolov. 
  [Prikhodko] Heretofore, most of the output of 
our enterprise was produced for the defense industry. Today this 
is no longer a secret. Nor is it a secret that our economic 
situation and development has been stable and secure: state 
orders, government support, priority funding. We have developed 
in conformity with long-term ideas and plans. In the period of 
1984-1985, in my opinion, we were minimally behind the world 
level of the electronics industry, probably only about 3-4 
years. We were being used by as many as 18 Soviet ministries: 
ultrapure materials, electronic equipment and precision machine 
tools, nonferrous metals, chemistry. Everything was clear and 
comprehensible for people, and salary was guaranteed. Moreover, 
the standard of living in Zelenograd was much better than that 
in other regions of the country. We could pick the best college 
graduates for our plants and institutes, engineers and workers 
were in competition for jobs. 
  [Lazareva]And was everything really so tranquil? 
  [Prikhodko] In reality, not at all. The main 
creeping danger was that people who had a comparatively high 
wage for those times were making no effort to improve quality 
and increase productivity of their labor. 
  [Lazareva]Indeed, that was no small danger for 
this kind of production. And when did the situation change 
drastically? 
  [Prikhodko]Our main troubles started in 1991. 
There was a dramatic reduction of state orders and budget 
funding, the Soviet-wide division of labor disappeared, and we 
were left without suppliers. Figuratively speaking, we were in a 
potential well. The simplest thing to do in such a situation is 
to let the buildings be used for commercial warehouses, and 
start making knickknacks, but that is not what was done. It 
ought to be mentioned that a microelectronics enterprise can't 
be shut down, something like an open-hearth furnace: 
purification of water and air, preparation of energy carriers, 
everything has to operate continuously. Besides, we knew that if 
people were laid off for very long without pay, we would not get 
them back. Therefore, simultaneously with curtailment of our 
usual production, we began to retool and set our sights on 
conquering our sectors on the international market. 
  [Lazareva]That was tough for sure; there 
wouldn't be many outside our country who could believe that we 
were in any condition to compete on the world level in 
microelectronics. 
  [Prikhodko] That's right. We were hard put to 
find foreign partners. A lot of times we took part in several 
delegations in a day. At first we were unable to make contacts; 
at that time we didn't have a handle on the way things were 
done. But it was explained to us by a representative of a 
Japanese company that according to their lights it is considered 
normal to make a little headway in one out of 200 talks. We had 
our first success with representatives of the Samsung Company. 
We agreed to produce on franchise a small clock chip for sale on 
their market. This is where the switch began from the Soviet to 
the Western style of production. We were well aware that this 
switch would take enormous capital investments: a different 
production structure would have to be set up. And incidentally, 
it cannot be said that this would have been beyond our reach. 
The level of production and quality control at our plants was 
still the highest in the nation: items went directly to outfit 
special facilities and space vehicles. In 1991, we experienced 
some decline in facilities for production development. In 1992, 
they began to arrive, and were mainly put to use in elevating 
the technical level of production. Samsung was followed by 
agreements with companies in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some 
European companies. Now more than 40% of the volume of our 
production output is exported by agreements. For businesses like 
ours, there has been a sharp decline in the number of previously 
planned state defense orders. We need a lot of money to acquire 
new equipment operating on the level of the latest technologies. 
Construction has now started on two new shops for producing LSI 
chips with micron design standards. A conglomerate of state 
structures is investing money in construction of one of these, 
and the ``Korona'' Joint Enterprise that operates in contact 
with a Hong Kong company is investing in construction of the 
other shop. 
  [Lazareva]And what have been the results? 
  [Prikhodko]The Russian production line is now in 
its third year of construction. The production cycle is totally 
dependent on the dynamics of incoming budgetary finances. 
``Korona'' has promised to complete construction in 20 months. 
Right now, 49 percent of the investment in this enterprise is 
foreign, and 51 percent is ours. We, of course, will have the 
controlling block of shares. 
  [Lazareva]But you can see that this is not a 
very productive way. The production manager is engaged in lots 
of talks, looking for partners... the next thing to hustling. 
  [Skvirya] We realized long ago that a new 
approach is needed here. And we are best suited for it: a small 
mobile enterprise where scientists work together who have a lot 
of contacts in their fields throughout the world. We know the 
directions of promising research, the interests of partners, and 
a host of foreign companies where talks will lead to the desired 
outcome. Many Western specialists and managers prefer to deal 
first with a small non-governmental company. So it is just this 
scientific-technical ``pimping'' that we are taking as one of 
the areas of our operations. It is convenient, effective, and 
mobile. On the other hand, we are the very ones who are 
concerned about Zelenograd enterprises. After all, they are like 
our children. ``Silikon'' originated at one time in the bowels 
of the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology. Graduates of 
that institute are now working in the research institutes and 
plants of Zelenograd. Even Pavel Prikhodko and the director of 
``Mikron,'' Gennadiy Krasnikov, are former MIET students. So our 
specialists are well aware of the industry in Zelenograd, its 
needs and specifics. 
  [Lazareva]And who else is ``Mikron'' involved 
with? 
  [Prikhodko] The mainland Chinese are very much 
interested in our technical advances. They are now marshalling 
considerable efforts and state funds for development in 
microelectronics; but Western franchises are too expensive, and 
therefore they are giving a lot of attention to markets of 
Russian microelectronic technologies. Contacts with the People's 
Republic of China may be quite profitable. I have been in China, 
and have had a lot of talks with their managers. Although it is 
well known that they are the oldest traders in the world, many 
of them are seriously studying marketing in Japan. Talks with 
representatives of Chinese companies always necessitate 
carefully reasoned strategy and tactics, bordering on art. 
Within the scope of this cooperation, we are also hoping to 
penetrate into the remaining markets of China and other 
Southeast Asian nations. You know, to all appearances, Western 
European nations are in no hurry to deal with us. And the 
situation with the U.S. is even more ambiguous. It looks like 
things are getting easier with regard to KOKOM organizations, 
but in connection with defense conversion--and they are involved 
in that, too--there are now already about 65,000 unemployed in 
their ``Silicon Valley''. So it is unlikely that there would be 
any profit from selling them franchises to the Russian market. 
  [Sokolov] According to some information, 
recently ``Silicon Valley'' companies that have been trying to 
establish relations with Russian businesses are having a tough 
time, and even being fined. But on the other hand, they won't be 
able to get by without contacts with Russia. The 
microelectronics industry is really quite hazardous. The U.S. is 
desperate to get it out of their country. Up until now, they 
have got by on contacts with Southeast Asian nations. And they 
are extending these contacts to us, as well--labor is cheap 
here, too. We would rise up against ecologically unsafe 
production, but that would put an end to our hopes for the 
future. Russia has to go through the stage of production by 
franchises, working to some extent for the Western market. In 
doing so, we must not fail to give some thought to the ones with 
whom we make contact. It would not be in our best interests to 
acquire technologies that are outdated (for them), going nowhere 
from the engineering standpoint, and ecologically dirty; and so 
far, that is what we are being offered. We have to look for the 
most promising franchises: comparatively new, competitive, and 
with opportunities for further independent development. This is 
the direction that our company is trying to take. 
  [Lazareva] But by your own words, the 
implication is that this is scarcely possible under present 
conditions. 
  [Sokolov]The main thing is to understand with 
whom we can deal. For example, we have been well aware that 
specialists of the well known U.S. company ``Sun Microsystems'' 
are working with Russian scientists, with the Moscow center of 
SPARC technologies, and with the largest Russian developer of 
supercomputers, Associate Member of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Boris Babayan. We have understood that these are the 
contacts that are needed. We have not procrastinated in starting 
talks, and have achieved some promising results. ``Sun'' has 
offered a franchise to ``Mikron'' for producing microprocessors 
by the most progressive SPARC technology. 
  [Lazareva]SPARC is a homonym of ``spark''. So is 
the franchise from ``Sun'' a spark of hope? 
  [Sokolov]To some extent, yes. The fact is that 
``Sun'' takes pride in its open technical policy. And that 
policy includes the opportunity, if that is the right word, of 
further creative development of their circuits. We have 
purchased not just a technology, but also data about the 
theoretical principles of production of the chip, mathematical 
groundwork, and architecture. On this basis, we have acquired 
access to international standards. And thanks to the 
considerable experience of scientists in our nation, we will be 
able to use the acquired technology as a springboard, or to put 
it in a better way, to skip over several steps and create our 
own Russian devices that are modifications of U.S. chips meeting 
specifications on the world level. There are companies in Russia 
that are ready to use these chips. It has been suggested that we 
use them for Russian workstations based on powerful personal 
computers. Design problems are being studied by Vladimir 
Betelin, director of NIISI [not further identified] of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences. In future he is hoping to arrange 
for industrial production. To carry out this project, monetary 
credits are being requested through the line of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences. The same source will allocate the necessary 
funds for ``Mikron'' to acquire a franchise for the chip. 
  [Lazareva]But are you sure that you will be able 
to carry out such ambitious plans just now? 
  [Prikhodko] Thanks to maintaining our potential 
for this period, we have not yet run out of energy. We are now 
starting to carry out large-scale international programs. The 
first is tied up with the ``Sun'' franchise. The second novel 
technology that we have developed is ultrathin silicon films on 
an insulator. This is called the SIMON process. A Russian- U.S. 
joint enterprise has already been set up. The money is being 
contributed by the U.S. side and some Russian businesses and 
organizations. Billions of rubles are needed for this promising 
technology. Our minister of science Boris Saltykov is very 
interested in this project. His technological fund is now ready 
to invest the necessary money in the SIMON process. To have the 
capability of carrying out the most flexible technical and 
economic policy, as well as to establish the closest working 
contacts with the world microelectronics community, our plant 
and his research institute have now set up a joint-stock company 
of open type. We feel that this is the most convenient form of 
privatizing a large state enterprise. 
  [Lazareva] Well, have you lost any of your 
essential personnel? 
  [Prikhodko] Of course, small businesses have 
taken away a lot of my specialists, and incidentally the best of 
them. One expects this. It is the educated, inventive, 
linguistically talented people with a feel for technology who 
can confidently count on independent success in small business. 
And many have been successful, but unfortunately are losing the 
qualifications necessary for our work. Right now in our 
association the average pay scale is 62,000. And the salary 
reaches something like 120 in a bread-baking plant, and even 
more in some small enterprises. Naturally, some are leaving for 
commercial structures, especially banks. We are also aware that 
the most successful of those who have left us for free 
enterprise are trying to get the greatest number of our shares 
when they are auctioned off. It is natural that in this 
situation we look out for the interests of our team of 
scientists and workers, so that they will be able to make 
continued use of the potential in microelectronics that they 
have created. 
  Let us hope that the controlling block of shares will go to 
people with clarity of purpose who have staked a lot and know 
what is worth attaining by their investment. And in the given 
case, the only thing worth attaining is getting the Russian 
microelectronics industry properly into the world distribution 
of labor, and making a profit.

  [Abstract] A specialized subscriber access algorithm and 
analytic relationships for calculating the capacity of a 
satellite communication system (SCS) is proposed. Two 
configurations of an SCS that implements the algorithm are 
examined. The first configuration assumes the simplest message 
stream generated by subscriber stations; the holding time is a 
random variable with an arbitrary distribution function. In the 
second configuration the message stream consists of simplest 
streams with different intensities and a certain holding time 
distribution. Both configurations are loss type queuing systems. 
Analytic relationships for calculating the capacity of this SCS 
are determined using the theory of queuing systems, 
particularly, the body of Markovian line processes. It is 
concluded that, all other things being equal, in order to 
determine an SCS capacity it is sufficient to know the average 
length of subscriber conflict notification and not to use the 
distribution law. An SCS capacity is higher when message 
switching is used. Figures 2, references 3.

<H5>  It is Just as Important That We Know How to Decommission Them </H5>
  [Text] ``Do not shut down any more reactors for any 
reason!'' pleaded Victor Mikhaylov, head of the Russian 
Federation's Ministry of Atomic Energy, during an interview 
published in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He is, of course, aware that 
six reactors already stand idle on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, including: 

  -  reactor 1 at the Metsamor nuclear power plant, idle since 
February 25, 1989, and reactor 2, idle since March 18, 1989; 
  -  reactor 1 at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, idle since 
August 6, 1984, and reactor 2, idle since August 29, 1990; 
  -  reactors 1 and 2 at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant, idle 
since September 10, 1981, and September 10, 1989, respectively. 
  -  Sixteen other reactor systems, including research reactors as 
well as critical and subcritical test reactors, are also being 
shut down. 

    The development of nuclear energy worldwide is closely 
regulated by the domestic nuclear policies of individual nations 
and by international law. Russia, however, although it regulates 
the design, start-up, and operation of its nuclear power plants, 
has no guidelines for decommissioning them. In a number of 
cases, this means delays in proceeding with the dismantling of 
plants that are currently in safe storage. 
  Meanwhile, since 1979, the Commission of the European 
Community has been assisting the international community in 
coordinating its efforts to resolve problems associated with 
decommissioning nuclear power plants. The commission establishes 
and finances from its general fund five-year research programs 
geared towards safety issues and protection from radiation 
during nuclear facility decommissioning. 
  Between 1979 and 1993, the CEC sponsored three programs for 
a 
total of 93.8 million European currency units (in December 1993, 
1 ECU equaled 1.11 dollars), and 126 program-related contracts 
were drawn up. 
  Programs administered by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency have established data bases on handling radioactive 
wastes and safely transporting radioactive materials. 
  In Japan, the RAN-DEC (Research Association for Nuclear 
Facility Decommissioning) was founded to study ways to safely 
dismantle obsolete nuclear facilities. 
  In 1979, the Technical Information Center was established at 
the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to 
provide information on the dismantling and decontamination of 
nuclear facilities. 
  And what is happening with the four idle reactors we now 
have 
in Russia? At the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, work is 
being done to complete the radiation survey of the equipment and 
structures (the work is about 70% complete), to develop 
experimental technologies for reprocessing radioactive wastes, 
and to decontaminate and dismantle the equipment. Spent nuclear 
fuel is completely removed and stored on site due to problems 
associated with transporting the containers and with the Mayak 
production association's (Chelyabinsk-65) refusal to take 
delivery of the fuel. 
  The first and second reactors of the Beloyarsk nuclear power 
plant, which are uranium-graphite RBMK-type reactors, were shut 
down because their critical components had reached the end of 
their rated service life and no longer complied with modern 
safety standards, and because they are not slated for 
reconditioning. 
  Beloyarsk-1 was shut down clear back in 1981. All of the 
fuel 
assemblies have been completely removed from the reactor. No 
more than 180 kg of fuel (measured with the gamma method, or 130 
kg if the neutron method is used) remains in the form of 
``spillage'' scattered throughout the reactor's pressure vessel 
lining. The reactor power control, active ventilation, and 
energy conservation systems are still running. 
  Beloyarsk-2 was shut down in September 1989. Removal of the 
spent fuel assemblies is nearing completion. Emissions of 
radionuclides into the unit's ventilation system are lower than 
levels detectable by the original monitoring equipment. 
  The plant's spent-fuel pools hold 4990 spent fuel assemblies 
in casks designed for ``dry'' storage. Because the seals of some 
of the containers have lost their integrity, uranium sometimes 
comes in direct contact with the cooling water, the 
radioactivity of which has increased 1.6-fold over the last 
three years. Technical safety requirements for storing spent 
fuel and handling radioactive wastes are not being observed. 
  Unfortunately, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy has pretty 
much left reactor decommissioning up to local authorities, 
resulting in missed objectives and unfinished work. Moreover, 
inspections by federal agencies have turned up violations of 
nuclear power safety practices and procedures, and, as a result, 
further decommissioning work has been suspended at the Beloyarsk 
nuclear plant until safe and proper working conditions are 
restored. 
  Beginning sometime between the years 2000 and 2005, most of 
the reactors at Russia's nuclear power plants will begin 
decommissioning, to wit: reactors 1 and 2 at the Kola nuclear 
power plant; reactors 3 and 4 at Novovoronezh; reactors 1-4 at 
Bilibino; and reactors 1 and 2 at Leningrad. Regardless of the 
reasons for decommissioning, it is an inevitable stage in the 
service life of a nuclear power plant. Therefore, it is 
necessary to formulate a comprehensive policy for 
decommissioning nuclear power plants, and this can only be 
accomplished with a great deal of theoretical and experimental 
information. The current inability to understand this or move 
this work forward will only cause additional problems for future 
generations.

  [Abstract] The subsalt sedimentary mantle of the eastern 
margin of the Pre-Caspian Depression, down to a depth of 6,935 
m, in a stratigraphic structure ranging from the Lower Permian 
Artinskian Stage to the Lower Devonian, contains four identified 
lithologic-stratigraphic oil- and gas-bearing systems belonging, 
based on lithologic-facies features, to various formations with 
different geochemical sedimentation conditions, scattered 
organic matter content and degree of catagenesis, having 
generating argillaceous deposits and oil and gas horizons with 
various types of traps. Their ages and differentiation are based 
on micropaleontological and palinologic factors. Detailed 
descriptions of the various formations are given along with site 
locations and breakdowns of the oils, condensates and gases 
noted. Seismic surveying and core sampling are used. The subsalt 
system contains hydrocarbon accumulations and pools and has 
mantles of argillaceous deposits and dense aphanitic carbonates. 
The Lower Permian sand-and-clay deposit systems forms an 
enormous clinoform containing claystones with small interlayers 
of brownish-gray limestones, siltstones, sandstones and 
gritstones. The sandstone-siltstone deposits decrease in 
thickness from east to west and the gritstones, in the same 
direction, are being replaced by sandy varieties. The system's 
upper boundary runs along the bottom of a Lower Kungurian 
Substage anhydrite seam, a logging marker for the depression's 
eastern margin, and the lower runs along the roof of carbonates 
in the Zhanazholian tectonic stage and a gamma-emitting band of 
black terrigenous-siliceous-carbonaceous rocks in the rest of 
the eastern margin. Part of the Lower Permian deposit system 
overlies Gzhelian CL-I [Carbonate Layer I] rocks, some of which 
show facies replacement by same-age deep-sea sediments of the 
gamma-emitting band. The Lower Permian system covers the first 
gamma-emitting band, which is spread above the CL-II carbonates, 
which show facies replacement by deep-sea sediments further 
west, toward the depression's central part. A second 
gamma-emitting band below the first joins with it and covers 
Lower Carboniferous Tula Horizon terrigenous deposits. Lower 
Permian Sakmarian and Asselian deposits in the northern 
extension of the North Embian uplift are carbonates overlying 
the CL-I layer and covered by Middle Jurassic terrigenous 
deposits. The Lower Permian deposits, located between reflecting 
marker horizons, decrease in thickness from east to west and 
from south to north, with complete or partial erosion noted at a 
number of sites of the nearside zone of the Ostansuk depression, 
the result of uplifting of the eastern margin area which forms 
the Ural Folding System. The Lower Permian system gradually 
sinks from east to west, from 2.3 km at the Ashchisay Fracture 
confining the eastern part of the Pre-Caspian Depression to 5.6 
km at the Shubarkuduk tectonic stage. A diagram is given of 
various structural elements of the eastern margin, showing 
various eastern margin boundary factures, sites, deposits and 
uplifts with signs of oil and gas in subsalt deposits, 
identified and assumed sections lacking Lower Carboniferous 
terrigenous deposits and various tectonic stages. The isoclinal 
Ostansuk platform depression is in the northeastern section of 
the margin. The Lower Permian rock system is an oil source bed 
with a high concentration of organic matter, basically 
sapropelic with some humus, and the deposits also contain 
various bitumens (some traces of epigenic type) and iron 
components (ferrous, pyritic and ferric). Hydrocarbons in the 
system have migrated to traps. Reference horizons (sandstones 
and siltstones) 12-135 m thick contain oil-bearing horizons, 
three Artinskian, four Sakmarian and one Asselian. The 
oil-bearing layers have various filtration properties and flow 
rates. Lower Permian deposit oil pools are dome types, but 
erosion shearing may have resulted in stratigraphic oil pools 
shielded by Kungurian deposits. The system's oils are brown and 
dark brown, with traces of sulfur, paraffin, sulfate resins, 
silica gel and asphalts. The methane-naphthene oils' hydrocarbon 
composition consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with 
traces of sulfur and nitrogen. The Gzhelian-Late Visean 
carbonate rock system, widespread in the depression's eastern 
section, consists of two layers, separated by Lower Podolskian 
Horizon sand-and-clay deposits and located between reflecting 
layers, and they were formed under shallow sea-basin shelf 
conditions and subjected to erosion when they were above sea 
level. Various limestones (organogenic-clastic, polydetrital, 
clustered-lumpy and pelitomorphic) are present, with a few 
dolomites. Various permeable seam traps exist. The lower layer's 
carbonates show sulfate formation and tufagenous material is 
present (feldspar crystals and some quartz). The system's upper 
boundary runs along a roof of Gzhelian limestones and anhydrites 
and the lower along a floor of Upper Visean limestones which lie 
on top of Middle Visean Tula Horizon terrigenous rocks. The 
Gzhelian-Late Podolskian upper carbonate layer (CL-I), located 
between seismically reflecting layers, containing mostly 
carbonates, with anhydrites in the northeast and terrigenous 
deposits in the north, has four productive gas and oil pools 
20-50 m thick. Upper Carboniferous upper gas and oil pools have 
the best trap properties. Oils are mostly methane-naphthene 
types, with sulfur, paraffin, resins and some asphalt, basically 
composed of carbon and hydrogen with slight amounts of oxygen 
and nitrogen. Condensates are bright-yellow methane-naphthene 
types, sulfurous, low-paraffin and resinous. Gases are primarily 
methane, ethane and propane with lesser amounts of butane, 
pentane, hexane, nitorgen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. 
Kashirian-Late Visean lower carbonate layer CL-II lies at depths 
ranging from 1,930 m to 5,280 m between reflecting layers and is 
divided by nine lithologic-stratigraphic horizons, with trap 
seams up to 70 m thick containing productive oil and gas pools 
and the seams separated by impermeable carbonates. Oils are 
greenish-brown methane-naphthene types, basically sulfurous, 
low-paraffin and slightly resinous with asphalts and composed of 
mostly carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, with a small amount of 
nitrogen. Condensates are bright-yellow and yellow 
methane-naphthene types, with small amounts of sulfur, paraffin 
and resins (up to 20 parts per 1000). Hydrocarbon gases are 
mostly methane and ethane with lesser amounts of propane, 
butane, pentane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. 
CL-I and -II carbonate system oils are basically the same type 
with differences in physical and chemical properties and an 
increased sulfur content associated with secondary changes 
during vertical migration of the oil and the influence of 
carbonate rocks on the migration paths and in the pools. 
Sedimentation of CL-I and -II occurred under unfavorable 
conditions of a shallow coastal sea basin shelf under oxydizing 
and dynamic circumstances. The carbonate rock system is not an 
oil source and could not produce hydrocarbons, the pools of 
which formed by migration from a Lower Permian oil-source system 
and possibly partially from deeper Lower Carboniferous 
terrigenous rocks. CL-I and -II carbonates contain epigenetic 
asphalt from two production periods, the second an oil-type, 
bright yellow with a bluish tint, found in porous layers, 
fractures and caverns. Gas pools formed apparently due to a 
sharp pressure drop during the oil's migration from lower 
terrigenous deposits to the higher-situated carbonates. 
Gamma-emitting bands of terrigenous-siliceous-carbonate rocks, 
widely dispersed in the eastern part of the Pre-Caspian 
Depression, are deep-sea or relatively deep-sea age analogs of 
Carboniferous carbonate deposits, are located under Asselian 
deposits and are reference horizons with bituminous organic 
matter, a significant amount of which is sapropelic in nature 
and gives them a chestnut-brown color. Rocks of the first 
gamma-emitting band, 18-83 m thick, are analogs of the deep-sea 
facies replacement of CL-I carbonates and are above the CL-II 
carbonates. Deposits of the second gamma-emitting band, 78-102 m 
thick, are analogs of CL-II carbonates, are on top of Middle 
Visean Tula Horizon sand-and-clay deposits and include 
claystones, limestones, radiolarites, silicites and siltstones 
with tuff and volcanic ash. The first band (at the 5050-5102 m 
level) has redeposited Upper Carboniferous and Moscovian 
foraminifera and the second (at the 5102-5177 m level) has 
redeposited Middle and Lower Carboniferous foraminifera. The 
claystones are silicified and pyritized, black, strongly 
bituminous, oily to the touch, with siltstone interlayers and 
occasionally turn into radiolarites and silicites. The 
limestones are silicified, black, aphanitic, dense, oily to the 
touch, with calcite-filled fractures and interlayers of 
silicites. The radiolarites are silicified, occasionally 
pyritized, slightly argillaceous, dark chestnut-brown and gray, 
platy, thin-layered, dense and bituminous, with some replacement 
by chalcedony and opal. The gamma-emitting bands are highly 
bituminous, with sapropelic organic material at the 
mesocatagenesis substage, and can be listed among the 
oil-producing deposits. Oils are brownish-green, low-sulfur, 
slightly resinous, with paraffin and some asphalt, and basically 
methane-naphthene types. The Lower Carboniferous sand-and-clay 
rock system of the Tula Horizon-Tournaisian graywacke formation 
extends in the eastern margin to the south of the 
Shengelshiyskiy sublatitudinal fracture. Present are claystones, 
siltstones and sandstones with interlayers of conglomerates 
similar in color and composition to the silico-igneous formation 
of the Sakmarian zone of the Mugodzhary mountains. Deposit 
thickness is 448 m at Vostochnyy Akzhar, increases to the east, 
reaching 1,510 m at Zhanaton, and also increases to the west 
according to seismic surveying. Greatest deposit thickness of up 
to 4.5 km occurs in the Embian pericraton deflection. The Middle 
Visean-Tournaisian rock system surface is a reflecting layer 
with the lower boundary running along a base of terrigenous 
rocks on top of Upper Devonian carbonates. Middle 
Visean-Tournaisian argillaceous deposits have a high 
organic-matter concentration, sapropelic-humus type, accumulated 
under favorable coastal-sea geochemical conditions, are 
oil-producing types and liquid hydrocarbon production is evident 
in the eastern margin, especially intensively in the Embian 
deflection. Structures formed in this region by the time 
hydrocarbon production began should be viewed as zones of oil 
and gas accumulation of sygenetic pools and primary sites for 
oil and gas prospecting operations. Lower Carboniferous 
deposits, from which oil has been obtained, need more study. The 
oil and condensates are predicted to be low-sulfur types based 
on genetic features of scattered organic material in Lower 
Carboniferous sand-and-clay deposits. The Middle 
Visean-Tournaisian deposits' oils are syngenetic to the 
surrounding rock, brownish-green, low-sulfur, with paraffin and 
some asphalt, and basically methane-naphthene types. A table is 
presented, showing the depths of the occurrences, in meters, of 
oil- and gas-bearing systems of subsalt sedimentary mantle 
deposits at various sites, ranging from Lower Permian down to 
Prelower Devonian and including the gamma-emitting bands, the 
CL-I and -II carbonate layers, the Lower Carboniferous 
gamma-emitting claystones and the Devonian carbonates. Upper 
Devonian carbonate system is between one set of reflecting 
horizons and Middle and Lower Devonian systems are between 
another set and are basically limestones with interlayers of 
claystones and organic matter and oil ooze in the fractures. 
Prelower Devonian deposits are dark-green-to-black dioritic 
porphyrites with calcite-filled fractures. Most of the rocks are 
plagioclase (andesites) with some hornblende, quartz and 
biotite, secondary minerals such as actinolite, apatite, 
chlorite and epidote, and accessory minerals such as magnetite, 
titanomagnetite and pyrite. The dioritic porphyrites have been 
subjected to dynamic metamorphism. The subsalt sedimentary 
mantle has three rock systems with high generating potential, in 
which hydrocarbon-generating processes have occurred and 
hydrocarbon traps are present. Lower Carboniferous terrigenous 
deposits have a greater production potential than Lower Permian. 
The gamma-emitting layers need more study. The depression's 
eastern section has four regional oil- and gas-bearing subsalt 
rock systems and shows some promise for discoveries of new 
hydrocarbon accumulations in the eastern margin. Structural 
formations arose much earlier than hydrocarbon production and 
endured some reorganization and disruption of the hydrodynamic 
conditions as shown by heavy oxydized residual oil in Lower 
Permian deposits. Deep-seated fractures are believed to be 
indicative of possible oil and gas fields, should help in future 
prospecting for oil pools and may also be helpful in locating 
new pools in CL-I and -II layers. Slopes of bulges and uplift 
areas which formed covering structures on Lower Carboniferous, 
Devonian and much older deposits may be promising for 
prospecting for stratigraphic oil pools. Figures 2.
