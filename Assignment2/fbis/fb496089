  [Text] The Angolan Government has presented to the 
mediators of the peace talks in Lusaka a proposal for the 
participation of the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] in the government with four ministries. These 
are the ministries of health, tourism, geology and mines, and 
commerce. The Angolan Government also accorded UNITA seven 
deputy ministries -- public works, defense, agriculture, 
finance, social administration [title as heard], social 
communication, and interior. Savimbi's organization also 
received six embassies and 140 local administration posts. This 
was revealed by the Portuguese News Agency LUSA.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good afternoon! Delegations from the government and 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
did not meet this morning. The negotiators from the government 
and UNITA were scheduled to meet this morning to continue to 
discuss the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black 
Cockerel [Vorgan], but the meeting did not take place. 
  It is believed that the (?failure) to hold the meeting is 
connected with a letter the UNITA negotiating team addressed to 
Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary 
general in Angola and the mediator at the peace talks, over the 
weekend. In the letter, UNITA asks for clarification on its 
role in the government at all levels. 
  Observers say that without this reply UNITA is not 
interested 
in progress on any other debate. Angola Radio Nacional learned 
that the government has already informed the mediator of its 
stand on UNITA's demands. It is hoped that this reply will be 
transmitted today by Alioune Blondin Beye, who left for Luanda 
yesterday for contacts with representatives of the U.S. Senate. 
Alioune Blondin Beye is expected to return to Lusaka at 1330 or 
1430. 
  The peace talks are therefore back to square one. The 
government wants to conclude discussions on the future of Radio 
Vorgan while UNITA says no, demanding first to know what posts 
it will have in the government. The talks have been 
characterized by progress and setbacks. 
  This afternoon, something will be defined, however, as long 
as UNITA receives the reply it desires. Unless the negotiators 
and mediators find a way out, everything will become 
complicated. A solution must be found however because it is 
imperative to advance firmly forward to bring peace to the 
Angolan people, who still trust in their officials, who in 
Lusaka are trying to find more just, viable, and lasting 
solutions for a better future for all. All that the delegations 
from the government and UNITA were able to do today was to hold 
internal meetings.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Paulo Chipilika by </F>
announcer Mariana Ribeiro in Luanda; date not given--live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Ribeiro] Justice Minister Paulo Chipilika 
recently visited the United States. He will talk to us about 
his visit. Minister, a very good evening. 
  [Chipilika] A very good evening. 
  [Ribeiro] What made you visit the United States, and what 
was 
the outcome of your visit? 
  [Chipilika] Good evening, viewers. I would first like to 
thank TPA for giving me this opportunity to talk about my visit 
to the United States. 
  First, I would like to note that I was invited by two 
agencies -- namely, USIA, the United States Information Agency 
[preceding four words in English], and the Afro-American 
Institute. The invitation came through the U.S. Embassy in 
Luanda. With permission from his excellency the prime minister, 
I visited the United States for two weeks. The main goal of my 
visit was to see how the U.S. judiciary functions. I can say it 
was an extraordinary experience from all aspects. I was able to 
see a judiciary with prestige and reputation, a well-organized 
and independent judiciary. In fact, this is enshrined in the 
U.S. Constitution. The people we spoke to, either from 
district, state, or federal courts as well as the Supreme Court 
[preceding two words in English] stressed the independence of 
the U.S. judiciary from the legislative and executive branches. 
  We visited prisons in Washington and in Alexandria, 
Virginia. 
We also exchanged views about our intention to establish a 
National Institute for Judiciary Studies, INEJ, and the training 
of magistrates for the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney 
General and Public Prosecutor. 
  We were in Atlanta, Georgia, where we visited a number of 
prisons. We were in Springfield, Illinois, and in San 
Francisco, California, where we visited district and federal 
courts. We went to the Law College of Stanford University. We 
were also in (?New York). So, those were the goals of our visit. 
  [Ribeiro] Your visit suggests that changes have been 
introduced within your ministry. 
  [Chipilika] It is obvious that we cannot....[pauses] We are 
a 
new democracy and, as we have stated time and again, the Angolan 
judiciary was negatively affected over the last few years. But 
there are common aspects. We have been calling for the 
independence of the Angolan judiciary. We are in favor of a 
dignified judiciary and that calls for suitable legislation and 
a sound remuneration. We saw that in the United States the 
judiciary is the foundation of democracy, and magistrates in 
that country are well remunerated--sometimes better than state 
governors. We were told that that was designed to prevent any 
form of corruption because there can be no justice with 
corruption. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces </F>
for the Liberation of Angola in Huambo on 28 May] 
  [Text] 1. In an attempt to blame the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for the disruption of the 
UN relief program at a time when the UN Security Council is 
about to meet and when U.S. senators are in Angola, government 
forces have been instructed by their General Staff to resume 
clashes in sensitive areas like Malange and Bie [Cuito]. 
  2. As reported in our previous communique, government forces 
resumed clashes in the city of Bie at 1950 on 26 May 1994. The 
clashes continue. 
  3. On 27 May 1994, government Su-22's and Su-25 bombed our 
positions, using 48 bombs of 250 kg each. Self-propelled 
long-range artillery units were fired in all directions, even 
hitting outlaying wards. 
  4. The clashes were stepped up on 28 May 1994 with 
government 
forces trying to expel our forces and the Air Force renewing its 
raids. 
  5. Incidents of this nature take place whenever a UN 
Security 
Council meeting is about to take place. 
  6. The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] are 
on alert and as usual will know how to give an appropriate 
response. 
  [Issued] Huambo, 28 May 1994 
  [Signed] Army General Ben Ben, FALA chief of staff

  [Excerpts] The war continues in the country. It was a 
bloody Monday for Cuito residents. According to provisional 
figures, 25 civilians have been killed and 65 wounded. Our 
correspondent Abel Abraao reports. 
  [Begin Abraao recording] More than 700 shells of various 
calibers were fired at the martyred city of Cuito by the rebels 
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] at dawn today. The heavy artillery shelling was 
accompanied by constant attacks on positions of government 
forces in the south of Cuito. It was the bloodiest attack since 
the Black Cockerel's men resumed their shelling of the city on 
26 May. 
  According to provisional figures, the shelling of the 
besieged city of Cuito by the enemies of the people and peace at 
dawn today resulted in the death of 25 people and the wounding 
of 65 others, mostly old people, children, and women. To raze 
Cuito to ground, Jonas Savimbi's army used all its sophisticated 
war materiel, including 120-mm guns [words indistinct]. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  UNITA has also been carrying out actions in Moxico. Our 
correspondent Paulo Cahilo reports: 
  [Begin Cahilo recording] A source from the Moxico Military 
Region said yesterday that UNITA forces murdered a 22-year-old 
woman and her baby, less than one year old, and then threw them 
into Luena River. This criminal action by the Black Cockerel's 
men took place at Saimina Ward, a few kilometers to the west of 
Luena. The source also said that over the past few days, UNITA 
troops have been murdering defenseless citizens, as part of 
their military strategy, thus increasing the people's suffering. 
  The military source also revealed that yesterday UNITA 
murdered three people on the outskirts of the city of Luena and 
wounded one person at Calanda, 18 km to the west of Luena. Also 
yesterday, one civilian was killed and another wounded after 
detonating a mine planted by UNITA. The military source also 
said that by 27 May, UNITA forces had murdered nine people and 
wounded 10 others on the outskirts of the city of Luena. 
  These actions once again confirm recent information that 
UNITA has been concentrating men and war materiel to launch a 
large-scale on the city of Luena. Meanwhile, the military 
command here in Luena has given assurances that the Angolan 
Armed Forces [FAA], the national police, and the civilian 
defense will not allow Jonas Savimbi's men to fulfill their 
objectives. FAA forces, the national police, and the civilian 
defense are ready to give adequate response to UNITA rebels, as 
was the case in 1991. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There has been another Angolan Government air raid 
today on the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] rebel stronghold at Huambo. The first claims that the 
city had been attacked came from UNITA sources at the weekend 
and they were confirmed by aid workers who have been forced to 
suspend their flights into Huambo. The escalation follows hard 
on the heels of reports of dozens of deaths in UNITA's shelling 
of the besieged cities of Malange and Cuito over the last few 
days. Karl Meyer of the London INDEPENDENT newspaper is in 
Luanda. On the line, Dan Isaacs asked him what information he 
had about today's raid on Huambo. 
  [Begin recording] [Meyer] Well, at about 1:30 this 
afternoon, 
some government jets came in and dropped some bombs on Huambo, 
apparently around Bairro Academico, which is right in the center 
of the city and near one of the main schools. It was very close 
to the of the house of the Irish Aid Agency, Concern, very close 
indeed, and there doesn't seem to be another raid this 
afternoon. So, [words indistinct]. 
  [Isaacs] Now, these aid agencies that are still in Huambo -- 
are they staying put or they are trying to leave now? 
  [Meyer] Well, right now, they are staying put, of course, 
because there is no plane going in there, as long the bombing 
raids continue. I think it will be very difficult to get some 
planes in there. I think some of them are coming out anyway; 
some of their workers are coming out anyway because they are 
already scheduled to come out. So, if a plane does get in 
there, they will be coming out. But, I think quite a few of 
them plan to stay on. It is very difficult to keep coming in 
and out of this city. So, I think some of them will stay on. I 
believe the Red Cross plans to stay on, for example. 
  [Isaacs] Now, with the escalation of the fighting in Huambo 
and other cities, like Cuito and Malange, it has been very 
difficult for the relief flights, for the World Food Program, to 
get in. Any more news about that? 
  [Meyer] No, as far as I know, they can't go in. I think in 
Cuito, shelling was continuing today, although it was less than 
it was before. In Malange, they are facing the same problem -- 
every time they try to take a plane in, UNITA mortar men put 
some shells in the airport area. Uige, of course, is the other 
city that has been blocked, that is in the north. But that is 
more of a decision -- if the aid (?can't get) into Cuito and 
Malange, then, the government is saying, well, you can't go to 
Huambo and you can't go to Uige.

  [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the 
UN secretary general in Angola, returned to Lusaka today after 
consultations with U.S. senators in Luanda. Our correspondent 
Manuel Conceicao in Lusaka has further details. 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] The delegations from the 
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] did not hold talks in Lusaka today. UNITA 
presented a verbal protest to the mediators this morning, saying 
it was not ready for talks with the government delegation today 
because of alleged air raids on Huambo by the Angolan Air Force 
yesterday. 
  The government negotiating team says it is not aware of the 
protest because the mediators have not said anything. This 
morning, the UNITA negotiating team phoned the government 
delegation leadership, suspending the meeting scheduled for 
today, because it was waiting for a reply from the mediators 
over a certain issue. We learned from reliable sources that the 
leadership of the UNITA negotiating team presented a protest to 
the mediators this morning. Alioune Blondin Beye was informed 
about the protest when he was still in Luanda and scheduled a 
meeting with the UNITA negotiating team. 
  Alioune Blondin Beye is now in Lusaka. Early this evening, 
he held a meeting an informal with the government negotiating 
team. The meeting that Alioune Blondin Beye will hold with the 
UNITA negotiating team this evening will decide whether or not 
there will be talks tomorrow. [end recording]

  [Text] It has been reported from Huambo that raids by 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] aircraft continued the whole day yesterday, causing 
extensive human and material losses. The MPLA-PT, as in the 
past, has directed its murderous fury on civilian wards. Our 
correspondent Lourenco Bento says not even National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators' houses 
were spared. The house of UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge 
Alicerces Valentim, who is currently in Lusaka, was destroyed 
yesterday. His family escaped unhurt. At present, crying can 
be heard everywhere. The hospitals are unable to cope with the 
increasing number of wounded people and face a shortage of 
medicines.

  [Excerpt] Ten members of the Front for the Liberation of 
the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] have turned themselves in to Cabinda 
Province authorities. They are youngsters whose ages vary from 
20 to 24 years old and served with FLEC-Renovated [R] and 
FLEC-Cabinda Armed Forces [FAC]. They turned themselves in to 
government forces in the (Mituma Quilundo) and (Cuanda) regions 
a few days ago. Nine of them belonged to FLEC-R and one to 
FLEC-FAC. 
  (Faustino Umbake), 24, was in charge of FLEC-FAC operations 
and served in (Guengue), (Mbamba-Quiguenge), Miconje, and Necuto 
regions. Joao Mario Braz was section chief in FLEC-R and headed 
a group that ambushed and attacked government positions in the 
Belize region. They said they surrendered to government forces 
because they faced hardships in the bush, like famine and 
misery. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Blantyre, May 29 (AFP) -- Malawi's outspoken trade 
unionist and opposition leader, Chakufwa Chihana, has accused 
President Bakili Muluzi of failing to unite the country, divided 
on regional lines since May 17 general elections. 
  Chihana, leader of the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), who 
was in third place in the presidential elections, said Muluzi 
had done nothing to unite the country, state radio reported 
Sunday [29 May]. 
  Speaking to reporters in the northern district of Rumphi, 
where he has his powerbase, Chihana called for unity talks 
between Muluzi and ex-president Kamuzu Banda and himself. 
  The densely-populated south voted overwhelmingly for Muluzi 
who comes from a southern district of Machinga, while the thinly 
populated north voted for Chihana, and Banda drew his votes from 
the central region, where he comes from -- setting the scene for 
regional division. 
  "People voted because Muluzi or Chihana comes from that 
area," said Muluzi last week, worried that his ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF) party did not win any parliamentary seat 
in the north. 
  Coalition talks between Muluzi's party and AFORD collapsed 
last week. UDF have ruled out any coalition with Banda's Malawi 
Congress Party. 
  UDF, which won 84 of the 177 parliamentary seats, has formed 
a minority government after failing to secure at least 89 seats 
to make 51 percent of the working majority in parliament. 
  AFORD with 36 seats and the MCP with 55, make a stronger 
opposition in parliament with 91 votes.

  [Text] The president of the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, 
Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, has advised the people of the northern 
region to ignore regionalistic tendencies, despite differences 
in political thinking with other regions. Addressing a mass 
rally at [word indistinct] yesterday, Mr. Chihana stressed the 
need for unity in the country. He told the people that regional 
politics would not hold them together, adding that the northern 
region could not stand on its own, since the region had 
inadequate resources. Mr. Chihana also urged the people to give 
due respect to the state president, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, and his 
government. Mr. Chihana will tomorrow address a mass rally at 
Mzuzu Stadium from three o'clock in the afternoon.

  [Text] The National Consultative Council, which was formed 
last year to oversee Malawi's political transition to multiparty 
democracy, has been wound up. Speaking at the final press 
conference in Lilongwe, the chairman of the council for the 
month of May, Mr. Lovemore Munlo, commended the role of the 
council played during the transition period. He explained that 
the council was instrumental in changing the political scene in 
Malawi, thereby producing the first parliament and president in 
a multiparty system. 
  On the council's final discussions, Mr. Munlo said members 
had appealed to the newly-instituted government to consider 
funding political parties to pay their election monitors. He 
explained that it is a constitutional requirement that 
government should fund political parties, to ensure their 
continuity, and also allow competitive politics as a pillar of 
multiparty politics in Malawi. Mr. Munlo also said that the 
council had agreed to turn the (?returnee) committee into a 
commission which will cater not only for returnees but also for 
destitutes.

<F P=106> [Article by Lourenco Jossias: "Problem of Arithmetic"] </F>
  [Text] With only five months remaining before holding 
elections in the country, the Supervision and Control Commission 
[CSC], the main body supervising the Mozambican peace process, 
has been facing another crisis over the past two weeks. The 
main signatories of the General Peace Accord, the government and 
the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], are engaged in a 
hot dispute. The government is accused of having "hidden" 
14,480 troops who were supposed to be confined in assemby areas. 
  The government is being asked to reveal where it has hidden 
these men. In defense, the government says these are soldiers 
who "do not exist". 
  It is a problem of arithmetic. The UN Operations in 
Mozambique [Unomoz] agrees that "there are serious discrepancies 
in early figures presented to the Unomoz Technical Unit by the 
government." 
  Manfredo di Cameranca, Italian ambassador to Mozambique and 
CSC member, says that the issue is not serious and that it is 
only a misunderstanding resulting from the fact that the initial 
figures presented by the government in 1992 were just estimated. 
The ambassador said: "They made wrong calculations. You 
cannot hide 14,000 soldiers without being discovered." He 
advised people not to dramatize the situation. 
  Aldo Ajello examined the peace process at a CSC meeting held 
on 22 April this year. He pointed out the existing problems and 
recommended solutions. 
  Cease-Fire Commission Chairman Colonel Pier Segala from 
Italy 
also read his report at the meeting. He presented the latest 
figures on troop confinement and demobilization. He said the 
government had confined 55 percent of its troops, that is 34,145 
troops out of a total of 61,638 initially declared. Segala said 
the government used 56 percent of its capacity in assembly areas 
and demobilized 22.3 percent of its 13,745 men. [figure as 
published] 
  Noting that all troops joining the Mozambique Defense Armed 
Forces [FADM] must be confined first, Segala revealed that a 
total of 1,875 government troops have already been selected to 
join the FADM forces. 
  Segala said that, according to the Unomoz Technical Unit 
figures, Renamo has already confined 81 percent of its forces, 
that is 15,517 troops, out of a total of 19,140. In centers for 
nonconfined troops, Renamo has 4,000 men and it has used 119 
percent of assembly areas' capacity. With regard to 
demobilization, Renamo has already demobilized 561 men and 
selected 1,891 men to join the new army. 
  The Unomoz official said in comparative terms "the 
government 
is behind in troop confinement," while "Renamo is behind in 
troop demobilization". 
  Segala was the first official to bring to light the issue of 
discrepancies in the number of government troops initially 
declared. The history is complicated, but he said that all 
figures produced by the Unomoz Technical Unit were based on the 
assumption that the government would confine and register 61,638 
troops in assembly areas and register 14,767 troops in centers 
for nonconfined . 
  "The new figures supplied by the government show only 49,630 
troops are to be confined in assembly centers instead of 
61,638." 14,480 troops are to be registered in centers for 
nonconfined troops. 
  Thus, according to the new figures, the government has a 
total number of 64,110 troops instead of 76,405. 
  Segala says in its report: "These new figures need a 
political scrutiny and the old percentages must be calculated 
again." With regard to Renamo, Segala said the situation is 
different because it did not present all the information on 
centers for nonconfined troops. 
  Col. Pier Segala said that by 21 April, a total of 22,106 
weapons had been collected from paramilitary troops, out of an 
expected 49,806. He said weapons collection are behind schedule 
in Nampula and Tete and have not yet begun in Inhambane. In the 
north of the country, only 8,646 weapons had been collected, out 
of an expected 14,801. In the center of the country, only 8,873 
weapons have been collected, out of an expected 15,634. In the 
south, 4,587 weapons have been collected out of an expected 
19,371. 
  The weapons collection are also under way in assembly areas. 
A total of 48,818 weapons has been collected in all the 49 
assembly areas by 21 April this year. Of this number, 35,599 
weapons were collected in government areas, while 13,219 were 
collected from Renamo areas. Of this number, 36,993 weapons 
have already been transported to regional depots. 
  Col. Segala also said that obsolete weapons are being 
destroyed. Funds resulting from the sale of melted obsolete 
military equipment will go to FADM forces, according to a mutual 
agreement between the parties involved in the peace process. 
  Col. Segala also referred to problems and incidents in 
assembly areas. He said the causes for these incidents are 
mainly the long period troops remain assembly areas (five months 
in some cases). On the government side, incidents were observed 
in Massinga, Namialo, Marrupa, Lichinga and Rio Save; while on 
Renamo's side, incidents were observed in Chiramba, Mohia, 
Magunde, Mavago and Lurio. In some areas there is a shortage of 
water and in other areas a shortage of food. 
  Segala spoke of the need to respect the timetable of the 
peace process until elections are held. 
  He said "the process is now irreversible" and added: "There 
is no more time to waste in examining and speaking about the 
situation. There has been enough time for that. Now is the time 
to act and implement the agreements." 
  CSC Chairman Aldo Ajello confirmed the figures contained in 
the report, notably the figures under dispute. He also briefed 
the meeting on a number of issues, including the existing 
relationship between the Unomoz Police and the Police of the 
Republic of Mozambique, an issue which has been referred to on 
many occasions, FADM's formation, and other issues. 
<H5>  It is a Question of Arithmetic, not a Political Issue </H5>
  Apparently, the government delegation did not view kindly 
the 
stand adopted by Ajello and Segala at the 22 April meeting, 
particularly the astonishing assessment of the peace process. 
  After several foiled attempts to hold a meeting, the CSC 
finally met on 5 May to examine Ajello's report. Teodato 
Hunguana, head of the government delegation, in the absence of 
Armando Guebuza, read a document disproving the issues raised by 
Ajello at the previous meeting. 
  Hunguana said: "It is our firm conviction that there will 
henceforth be a fundamental difference between the method of 
"briefings" or news conferences and the method followed at CSC 
sessions". 
  Examining point by point the issues raised in the report 
presented by Ajello and Segala, Teodato Hunguana referred to the 
main issue of troop confinement and demobilization, notably the 
"alleged discrepancies between figures so far produced by the 
Unomoz Technical Unit and the figures produced by the 
government. The government says 49,638 its troops are to be 
confined in 29 assembly areas, not 61,638. It also says that it 
has 14,480 troops in centers for nonconfined troops. 
  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana said the discrepancy results 
from the fact that the Unomoz Technical Unit based its work on 
the "assumption" that the government had to confine and register 
61,638 troops in 29 assembly areas and register 14,480 in 
centers for nonconfined troops. "It was just an assumption," 
Hunguana said. 
  The head of the government delegation recalled that after 
the 
signing of the peace accord, there was a need to urgently 
present to Unomoz a list of troops to be confined. In view of 
this urgency, the two sides presentation of lists was made on 
the assumption that they contained estimated figures that could 
be corrected as the process went on. The adjustments are 
provided for in Protocol VI of the General Peace Accord. 
  Hunguana said on 9 November 1992 the government delegation 
informed the CSC that the government would confine 61,638 troops 
in its 29 areas. It also said that it would inform the CSC 
about troops' figures in centers for nonconfined troops. 
  The figure of 61,638 was used by the government in various 
meetings of the Cease-Fire Commission and it was this same 
figure that was presented at the donors' conference in Rome in 
December 1992. 
  Teodato Hunguana said the government has carried out work 
aimed at presenting the correct number of its troops. He said 
this work was complex, characterized by organizational 
difficulties, because of the war. 
  After the work was carried out, the government supplied the 
figure of 64,118 as being the most up to date figure of 
government troops. It also gave the figure of 14,480 as the 
number of its troops in centers for nonconfined troops. 
  Hunguana said the figure of 14,480 is part of the 64,118 
government troops. He said the CSC thought it was an additional 
figure and added it to the figure of 61,638 presented by the 
government in 1992, thus concluding that there was a shortage of 
12,000 troops. [figure as published] 
  Teodato Hunguana said: "It is just a question of clear 
discrepancy of figures which does not correspond to reality. 
Thus, there is no political problem which requires a political 
scrutiny. It is just a question of arithmetic." 
  The minister also spoke about the proposals to reduce FADM 
forces by 50 percent. 
  The labor minister said: "If 30,000 troops for FADM was 
already a ridiculous figure... their reduction by 50 percent is 
tantamount to saying that this country does not need or deserve 
an effective Armed Forces, but just a make-believe force." 
<H5>  Government's Explanation Does Not Convince Renamo </H5>
  Raul Domingos, head of Renamo's delegation to the CSC, says 
the government explanation about the alleged discrepancy in 
figures "neither convinces nor mollifies. It is a matter of 
14,000 people that cannot be accounted for and there can be no 
error in estimating such a large number. It is an army that is 
in hiding and the government will have to tell us where those 
men are whose names have disappeared from the lists all of a 
sudden." 
  Like Hunguana at the CSC meeting, Domingos read a document 
commenting on Ajello's report. 
  Basically he agrees with Segala's report that Renamo has 
confined more men (81 percent of all its personnel) and says the 
slow demobilization of his movement's troops is due to technical 
problems. (He also told SAVANA that Renamo still had to confine 
19,140 troops. Of these, 15,000 are for the new army and 4,140 
will be demobilized. Right now, Unomoz has a list of 2,900 men 
to be demobilized -- that is, more than half.) 
  Renamo has doubts about the discrepancy in the government's 
figures. It feels there are political problems and not merely 
an "underestimation of figures." Raul Domingos added: After 
all, for a long time now, "we have been complaining that the 
government was transferring soldiers to the police and has taken 
many men from Snasp [People's National Security Service] to the 
police. The police have been creating instability." 
  According to Domingos, the number "the government now says 
refers to its troops differs from the figure of 26,480 soldiers 
the CCF submitted to Unomoz." 
  Renamo thinks that between 14,480 and 10,480 soldiers could 
have been "put aside" for the formation of a private army. 
  Commenting on the disbanding of paramilitary forces, Renamo 
noted that a deadline had been set for December 1993. In line 
with the timetable, that would have coincided with the start of 
the confinement of troops from both sides. 
  The Renamo document says logistical reasons prevented it 
from 
supplying in due time the figures about centers that would 
harbor troops not earmarked for confinement. Those reasons 
include lack of transportation, communications, and office 
equipment. 
<H5>  Let Us Not Dramatize Things -- Manfredo di Camerana </H5>
  Manfredo di Camerana, Italian ambassador to Mozambique, who 
has for a long time now been linked to the peace process, says 
the "numerical discrepancy" has been looked into in an 
exaggerated manner. 
  He said: "We are coming under pressure as October 
approaches, and the psychological factor is very important." 
  According to Di Camerana, all sides have great expectations 
about the conclusion of the process. "There is a great deal of 
pressure in terms of time and that does not permit a clear and 
calm assessment of situations." 
  He pointed out to SAVANA that a precise number of government 
and Renamo troops was never discussed in Rome. 
  "We have always asked for an estimate, and the final figure 
was clearly 30,000 for the single army." 
  The ambassador said the mediators and the observers had 
always realized that the sides would have difficulties in making 
estimates and that the real figures would come up as the 
confinement and demobilization of troops began. In fact, 
everybody started counting as of the start of those processes. 
  He recalled that the initial figure given by the government 
was 61,638 troops that would report to assembly areas, and 
14,480 that did not need to be confined to assembly areas. That 
was in 1992. 
  Since then until 20 April 1994, the figures have been 
checked 
and updated. 
  The ambassador commented: "I do not think there has been any 
government attempt to hide such a large number of soldiers." He 
added: "It was indeed an underestimation. It is ridiculous to 
think there are troops hidden from both sides." 
  Di Camerana advised people to be calm and carefully consider 
things. "We cannot dramatize things. Let us not create a 
controversy about it because that could cause irreparable damage 
to the country." 
  The Italian diplomat has always said he thought the process 
would be difficult and demand patience from all of us. That is 
why we "have always said disputes cannot be settled outside the 
mechanisms provided for by the accord. No unilateral decisions 
ought to be taken." 
  The government's attitude in suspending the demobilization 
of 
troops has been criticized by both di Camerana and the CSC. The 
ambassador, who is represented at the CSC, commented: "That 
does not help the process in the least, and then... it is the 
government that will have extra work to do with its troops." 
  He said that during his last visit to Rome, Dhlakama was 
advised that it served no purpose to dramatize the issue of 
"numerical discrepancy." 
  "We asked for moderation because there could be errors in 
the 
Defense Ministry's financial or bureaucratic sectors, but not 
14,000 men in hiding." 
  By criticizing Renamo for dramatizing things, and the 
government for making unilateral decisions, Di Camerana said 
there is a danger of the whole process coming to a halt if calm 
does not prevail over radical positions. 
  The biggest difficulties he foresees, and which he feels 
should be of concern to all, are of a technical and logistical 
nature, regarding the formation of the FADM and the elections. 
  "The barracks are not up to standards and troops cannot 
agree 
to go to a training center to eat badly, to sleep on the floor 
or on a floor mat." Likewise, there is still a lot to do about 
the electoral process. 
  Di Camerana has other worries: How to make the giants of 
Mozambican politics (government and Renamo) embark on politics 
and on a campaign without talking about the past, without 
accusing each other about past problems, but by only debating 
the programs for the country's future? 
  He asked: "Where are their programs and why do they not 
trade accusations about them?"

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama by </F>
unidentified correspondents "shortly before departure" to the 
United States; place not given] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
leader Afonso Dhlakama has left for the United States. Afonso 
Dhlakama's visit to the United States is primarily aimed at 
briefing the American people on the progress of the peace 
process and reaffirming Renamo's acceptance of the UN Security 
Council Resolution on Mozambique. 
  In an interview with journalists shortly before departure, 
Dhlakama said that if the United States today recognizes that 
there is peace and freedom in Mozambique, this is due to 
Renamo's struggle. He was answering a question on existing 
misunderstandings between the U.S. Administration and Renamo. 
  [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I am fully convinced that the 
situation is different now. We all know that historically the 
United States played a very bad role in Mozambique. It 
supported the Communist regime of the Mozambique Liberation 
Front [Frelimo] Party. They never tried to pressure Frelimo to 
accept peace talks. This made the war last longer, causing more 
deaths. I think, however, that with the end of war the United 
States recognizes that there is now peace, democracy, and 
freedom due to Renamo's struggle. I am fully convinced that 
changes exist there. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] at a time when we are 
preparing for the beginning of voter registration? What is 
[words indistinct] Renamo areas have not yet been opened? 
  [Dhlakama] Well, the areas have been opened. They have been 
opened. I have said on several occasions that it is the Frelimo 
government which is sabotaging the process. Mechanisms have 
been created to reunite the two administrations. Renamo 
advisers were appointed to carry out work jointly with the 
provincial governors. What is happening now? These advisers are 
not doing their work because the Frelimo government is 
sabotaging it. It does not provide them transportation and thus 
they cannot move about. 
  I believe, however, that a solution is being found now. The 
territorial commission, established during the General Peace 
Accord to deal with these issues, held a meeting last week and 
it was agreed that the Mozambican Government would immediately 
appoint administrators in areas under Renamo control. The 
meeting also agreed that the government would establish police 
stations in Renamo-controlled districts and posts, under the 
supervision of the United Nations and the National Commission 
for Police Affairs [Compol]. 
  This means that we are moving forward. Evidently, Frelimo 
tried to sabotage this process which should have begun months 
back. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] voter registration 
process 
will [words indistinct]? 
  [Dhlakama] Absolutely. There are no problems. This will 
depend on the work of the voter registration teams. The teams 
are made up of elements close to the Frelimo Party. According 
to the law, it is the public service [words indistinct] the 
Frelimo Party doing this. Opposition parties have their 
elements in each team, however, in order to monitor the voter 
registration process. If we observe that there are 
irregularities [words indistinct]. We want all the Mozambican 
people, without discrimination, to take part in voter 
registration. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Referring to the national conference unarmed 
opposition parties and Renamo held in Xai-Xai, Afonso Dhlakama 
said the meeting was positive, pointing out that it made 
positive steps forward toward defeating Frelimo in the October 
elections.

  [Text] Harare May 29 SAPA -- The capacity for Zimbabwe's 
fragile political opposition to take on President Robert 
Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National 
Union-Patriotic Front] party in elections next year appeared to 
deteriorate sharply this weekend as the squabble-torn Forum 
Party of Zimbabwe [FPZ] expelled its leader, former Chief 
Justice Enoch Dumbutshena. 
  Reports in the local press on Sunday said the 75-year-old 
lawyer had been voted out at a stormy meeting here on Saturday 
where he was accused of incompetence, selfishness and a lack of 
respect for other party officials. 
  He was replaced by the party's secretary-general, Mr Themba 
Dhlodlo. 
  It was not clear if Mr Dumbutshena was present at the 
meeting 
of 300 delegates from five of the party's provincial 
organisastions. Attempts to reach the ousted leader were 
unsuccessful. 
  Observers say Saturday's action may well ring the death 
knell 
for the FPZ, torn by in-fighting almost since its inception two 
years [ago]. FPZ was launched amid great hopes that its 
leadership of respected figures could at last present a strong 
challenge to Mr Mugabe. 
  Of the 120 elected seats in Zimbabwe's Parliament, only 
three 
are held by opposition MPs. Much of the rest of the opposition 
is headed by failed elderly politicians. 
  Two months ago, a group of FPZ officials staged a 
demonstration against Mr Dumbutshena, and he had 22 of them 
expelled for indiscipline. 
  The incident occurred almost simultaneously as Mr Mugabe 
tried to fire his party's youth league with enthusiasm on 
Saturday. He urged them at their congress here to start a 
house-to-house campaign to "send a message to those little 
parties that think the opportunity is ripe to take over and 
destroy the revolution".

  [Text] Harare May 30 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's main political 
opposition, the Forum Party, appeared to be in a state of 
confusion on Monday as its leader dismissed weekend reports that 
he had been expelled and promised that party rebels who had 
tried to get rid of him would themselves be thrown out. 
  Former Chief Justice Enoch Dumbutshena, 75, was quoted in 
Monday's issue of the independent daily GAZETTE as saying: 
"They cannot, absolutely cannot, expel me." He said the 
weekend's developments were unconstitutional and the work of "a 
bunch of malcontents". 
  Reports on Sunday said 300 Forum Party (FPZ) members 
representing five provinces met on Saturday and passed a vote of 
no confidence in Mr Dumbutshena. They were responding to claims 
that he was arrogant, a tribalist and incompetent. 
  Themba Dlodlo, a university lecturer and FPZ secretary 
general, was appointed acting-president. "I can only be 
expelled by the National Executive...or by a meeting of the 
congress of the party," Mr Dumbutshena said. "I take no notice 
of their action and the Forum Party will carry on as usual. If 
they want to form their own party they are free to do so." 
  A meeting of the party executive would be called which would 
"certainly see more expulsions". 
  The GAZETTE also quoted senior party officials as saying 
they 
fully backed Mr Dumbutshena, but observers said the new division 
was certain to damage the party's credibility and deeply 
disillusion supporters. 
  When it was launched two years ago the FPZ was seen as the 
only choice among several opposition parties split by bickering 
capable of mounting a serious challenge to President Robert 
Mugabe's ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF 
[Patriotic Front]) party in elections next year. 
  The FPZ recently alarmed the ruling party in its first test 
of public opinion by running in two local government 
by-elections. It took one seat in the western city of Bulawayo 
because ZANU (PF) failed to put forward a candidate, and another 
in Harare where its candidate trounced a well-known ZANU (PF) 
figure. 
  But the party has been repeatedly torn by squabbling, most 
seriously in March when 22 officials were expelled for holding a 
public demonstration against Mr Dumbutshena.

  [Text] Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said his 
political opponents are being manipulated by whites in the 
country, who are once more resorting to racial arguments on the 
eve of elections in Zimbabwe. Speaking before Zimbabwe African 
National Union members, Mugabe said one of the examples of these 
politicians is Enoch Dumbutshena, the leader of Zimbabwe 
Movement of Unity and former chairman of the Supreme Court. 
Mugabe has been accusing the country's whites of racism for 
resisting the government's plans of acquiring agricultural land 
and distributing them to black farmers. Whites say the 
government is using the agricultural issue to restore its 
popularity before the elections.

  [Text] President Nelson Mandela and the leader of the 
Conservative Party [CP], Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, agreed during 
talks in the Union Buildings in Pretoria this morning to 
establish a trilateral negotiating forum to discuss an Afrikaner 
volkstaat [homeland]. President Mandela said it would be 
senseless to hold parallel talks with the Volkstaat Council and 
the CP. He said the talks between the government, the Freedom 
Front, and the CP would be headed by Deputy President Thabo 
Mbeki. 
  Indemnity for right-wingers, who committed political crimes 
since December 1993, was also discussed. At a news conference 
after the talks President Mandela announced that Dr. Hartzenberg 
would hold urgent talks with Justice Minister Dullah Omar on 
indemnity. Dr. Hartzenberg said he wanted to give input on the 
bill Mr. Omar was preparing before it went through Parliament. 
When asked whether the government was planning to hold talks 
with AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene 
Terreblanche, President Mandela said the government's door was 
open to all who wanted to negotiate, but added that nobody would 
be forced to talk to the government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Constitutional Assembly Chairman and ANC </F>
General Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa by RAPPORT correspondent 
Hanlie Retief in the "Hanlie Retief's People" column] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Retief] When you recently did 
not get the post of deputy president, and later decided not to 
accept a cabinet post as minister of foreign affairs, it sent 
shockwaves through the country. Did you realize what the 
consequences would be? 
  [Ramaphosa] I think people did not really consider what is 
important for the organization. They wanted me to be in the 
cabinet. I went further than that, and now I have two posts 
that I will try to balance. 
  [Retief] Will you be able to do that? 
  [Ramaphosa] I think I will be successful. 
  [Retief] So what you are saying to me is: I was big enough 
to further party interests and not Cyril Ramaphosa's. 
  [Ramaphosa] Yes, the party's. [passage omitted] 
  [Retief] When you sat there on Tuesday morning before the 
biggest gathering of political forces in the country, and as 
chairman of that gathering, it must have been a good feeling. 
  [Ramaphosa] Yes, it made me feel wonderful. It is also an 
enormous challenge -- an extremely big challenge. 
  [Retief] And does it compensate for the defeat in the race 
for deputy president? 
  [Ramaphosa] Was it ever a race? 
<H5>  True Story </H5>
  [Retief] So tell me the true story ... 
  [Ramaphosa] In the end President Mandela decided for 
himself. 
There is work for us on various fronts, inside the cabinet, 
inside parliament, and outside. I naturally wanted to create a 
good balance. Now I am in parliament as chairman of the 
Constitutional Assembly, but I am also outside parliament as 
secretary general of the ANC. 
  [Retief] Come now. You must have been disappointed when you 
did not get the post? 
  [Ramaphosa] Well...disappointment is not the issue. Rather, 
it is a question of where the organization wants to use you. 
  [Retief] But Mr. Ramaphosa, you have lots of ambition.... 
  [Ramaphosa] You see, even as far as ambition is concerned in 
an organization like the ANC it rather becomes a question of 
application. You are used for a specific task. 
  [Retief] So you are telling me that you do not even possess 
a 
little personal ambition? 
  [Ramaphosa] Of course I have, but in this case because it is 
in the best interest of the country you focus more on how you 
can best be used in the service of the country. 
  [Retief] Some say you just took a calculated risk in saying 
no to a cabinet post and that you are not completely out of the 
running for president.... 
  [Ramaphosa] That is speculation. 
  [Retief] And what do you say about this speculation? 
  [Ramaphosa] I only serve the movement -- I serve the people. 
I will do whatever they ask of me. The ANC caucus unanimously 
decided that I should be chairman of the Constitutional 
Assembly. They even applauded this. That was the wish of the 
people. 
  [Retief] But you are excluded from cabinet -- from cabinet 
decisions ... 
  [Ramaphosa] No, no, I do not have to be there. In any case, 
I would have been severely limited. Now things are nicely 
balanced. I can now work in the ANC office, be in parliament, 
and in the Constitutional Assembly. 
<H5>  Leadership </H5>
  [passage omitted] [Retief] Now, about the Constitutional 
Assembly: In a sense the chairman is prevented from actively 
participating in the debates. Will this limit you? 
  [Ramaphosa] No, absolutely not. I am an ANC man. I will 
further ANC policy. I will obviously be fair to all people as 
chairman. So...this man's mouth will not be silenced. 
  [Retief] Will the new constitution differ greatly from the 
present one in your opinion? What is your comment? 
  [Ramaphosa] One cannot speak for the Constitutional 
Assembly. 
  [Retief] But your opinion? 
  [Ramaphosa] It is a very important body. The two houses will 
come together to write the constitution and, in that sense, one 
cannot predict what will happen. It is a gathering of big 
talent, divergent views. Everything must flow smoothly. 
  [Retief] But what aspects would you like to see changed? 
  [Ramaphosa] There are a few, like the way in which 
provincial 
governments function. It is a new field for all of us but we 
must explore it. I think the Human Rights Charter must be 
strengthened. The functions of cabinet should also be reviewed. 
<H5>  Constitution </H5>
  [Ramaphosa] We are going to tackle it as if we are writing a 
whole new constitution. We are going to start from the 
beginning. We are going to look at the important aspects, and 
the ANC will not run over other groups. We have two years at 
our disposal. I think it can be done within a year. 
  [Retief] Parties like the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and 
the 
NP [National Party] would still like to see strong federal 
concepts in the new constitution. How do you feel about this? 
  [Ramaphosa] They should not be scared to state their views. 
They should not hesitate. We are looking for really good debate 
in the Assembly. In the end, certainly, we will have a 
constitution with federal characteristics as well as unitary 
characteristics. 
  [Retief] Good, but what is your view on a strengthening of 
federalism? 
  [Ramaphosa] I am not a federalist, neither am I in favor of 
applying only unitary policies. I am in favor of a combination 
of the two. To the extent to which one needs strong federal 
government -- I support federal characteristics. To the extent 
where at central level you have to ensure that you can 
coordinate matters effectively -- well then, I am in favor of 
unitary policies. 
  [Retief] Would you like to see the concept of a government 
of 
national unity continuing in the new constitution? 
  [Ramaphosa] From an ANC point of view, no. Definitely not. 
We must have a democratic election so that leaders who have 
majority support will hold cabinet portfolios. 
  [Retief] Will the functions of the Constitutional Assembly 
not be just a repetition of the negotiating council with the 
planning committee as its driving force? 
  [Ramaphosa] No, we will have continuous consultations on a 
formal level, something the negotiating council did not make 
provision for. One of my chief tasks will be to ensure that the 
constitution writing process is not only legal, right from the 
very beginning, but to see that it is also representative. I 
want divergent views from all our community structures to be 
placed on the table -- open and transparent. People should feel 
that the constitution belongs to them -- it is theirs. That is 
what we have to do. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Karin Brynard and Anne-Marie Mischke in Cape Town] </F>
  [Text] The ANC's parliamentary caucus this week voiced its 
discontent about the organization's leaders. Several members 
are believed to have expressed serious dissatisfaction at 
Thursday's caucus meeting, saying that decisions were being 
taken without them being considered. 
  ANC MP's have warned their leaders that in future the caucus 
has to be taken into account, especially when they negotiate 
behind the scenes with the two other parties in the government 
of national unity, the National Party [NP] and the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP]. 
  One source of dissatisfaction this week is said to have been 
the election of Mr. Leon Wessels of the NP as deputy chairman of 
the constitutional assembly against the will of the caucus. 
  And there was also considerable anger on Thursday stemming 
from the absence of President Mandela and several other leaders 
from the caucus meeting. They received the message clearly: In 
future they must attend caucus meetings. 
<H5>  Deeper Cause </H5>
  The restlessness has a deeper cause. Many ANC MP's are 
deeply concerned that there could be a rift between members at 
ground level and the public representatives. If the leaders 
cannot even stay in touch with the caucus, it is being asked, 
how are the representatives going to keep in touch with the 
people out there? 
  The fear is that the ordinary people will soon say the 
representatives are living in luxury and forget about them. 
Rumblings were heard this week from trade union circles 
concerning MP's salaries. 
  In the parliamentary debate on the president's speech this 
week, ANC MP's have also expressed their concern regarding the 
situation. Gill Marcus has referred to the need for 
communication with the people out there. Mr. Raymond Suttner 
has asked the ministers to continue involving "the people" in 
running their departments and in taking important decisions. 
The people are not prepared to remain as spectators, he said. 
  It is against this background, it has been said, that Mr. 
Cyril Ramaphosa has decided to refuse a cabinet post to 
concentrate on consolidating the party. It is also for this 
reason that the National Executive Committee of the ANC, under 
the leadership of Mr. Ramaphosa as secretary general, will play 
an equally important role -- if not a bigger one than the caucus 
-- in constructing ANC policy. 
  It is also due to the concern over possible alienation 
between the representatives and the people at ground level that 
the ANC has decided to make the MP's and members of the 
provincial legislature responsible for every magisterial 
district in the country -- almost like in the days of the 
electoral constituencies. In this way the representatives are 
forced to maintain contact with the people. 
  In fact, all parties are talking about the electoral system 
of the future. According to the current proportional electoral 
system, no provision is being made for constituencies. The 
advantage is that a party's support is accurately reflected by 
its number of representatives. Nobody is of the opinion that 
the system should be completely abandoned. 
  But RAPPORT heard this week from all parties that in the 
five 
years before the next election, serious consideration will be 
given to a combined system in which a part of the MP's will be 
elected based on the proportional system and some will be 
elected according to the constituency system. 
  In Germany, for instance, such a system is used. The problem 
is, however, that the system is complicated and could confuse 
illiterate voters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad by </F>
reporter Freek Robinson; place and date not given; on the 
"Agenda" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Mr. Aziz Pahad, deputy foreign minister, 
welcome back from the United Nations. What was the spirit there 
when you were there? 
  [Pahad] Well, as reflected in the interviews with Addis 
Ababa, the United Nations welcomed us very warmly. The Security 
Council debate had 34 countries participating in a topic quite 
important for us, and generally, the secretary general conveyed 
the message that they were willing and they were waiting for us 
to retake our seat at the United Nations so that we can play a 
role in that family of nations. So, overall, I think, 
everywhere across the continent and the world they are expecting 
us to play a very positive role in world politics. 
  [Robinson] Well, I think we will talk about the United 
Nations in a moment with Mr. Brahimi here as well, but could you 
first just try to give us an indication, Mr. Pahad, of South 
Africa's foreign policy? Is it something that you can call a 
specific name at the moment, say something such as an 
internationalist policy, or what? 
  [Pahad] Well, South Africa's foreign policy has been 
evolving 
over years. As you know we have been isolated for over 40 
years. We are now being accepted warmly into the community of 
nations, and our policy will have to reflect that. We are, of 
course, now accepting that we are a country which is African. 
We are not a European outpost in the African continent, so our 
specific interests have to be in our region initially, and in 
the African continent generally. 
  That is why our joining the OAU is so important for us. It 
means becoming the 53rd member state of the OAU. We can now 
contribute to the role that Africa can play in world politics. 
I seriously believe that we can make a major contribution to 
the work of the OAU, but in that we can then make a contribution 
to Africa's role in international politics. We have very major 
roles to play. 
  I think our experiment in finding a negotiated resolution to 
our problems, which many people did not expect, has indicated 
that we have got an experience that we must now take to the 
other international arenas. I think that we are committed now 
to playing a role in the human rights struggle, democratization 
struggle globally and on the African Continent. We are going to 
commit ourselves to ensuring that we try to resolve conflict 
through negotiations, and try to solve all problems through 
negotiations, and I think our own experience would help us well 
in that perspective that we are going to put forward. 
  We will join, of course, the Southern African Development 
Community, which will mean that it will be an element of our 
economic relationship that we will have with our region. I want 
to also say that as South Africa, the government of national 
unity is committed to struggling for democracy across the world, 
but also against racism wherever it emerges. We were recipients 
of international solidarity that was unprecedented. It is up to 
us now to ensure within our limited possibilities we will 
contribute to making the new world a better world. 
  [Robinson] Well, if you say that we must get involved in the 
resolution of conflicts, the first one might be Rwanda? 
  [Pahad] Well, Rwanda is a sad and a very tragic situation, 
and we have already indicated as South Africans we are very 
concerned about the carnage that is taking place there. We are 
discussing with the United Nations, we had discussions with the 
secretary general of the United Nations, we had discussions with 
the vice president of the United States, and we've had 
discussions in Addis Ababa with the OAU to try to work out a 
common approach to how to resolve this. We are committed to a 
system in any way possible to try to resolve the problems in 
Rwanda. 
  We are also as committed to trying to help the process in 
Mozambique and Angola, and wherever we can. In that context we 
will use all our capacity to help resolve those problems, and we 
want to put forward a message that our task will be to try to 
ensure that we try to resolve any conflict through peaceful 
means and through negotiated solutions. 
  I think South Africa now has been accepted as having gone 
through what everybody sometimes referred to as a miracle, and I 
think our own experience, the fact that we have got a government 
of national unity that is now committed to the African continent 
will give us a better position to deal with this situation in 
Rwanda, not necessarily in a military way. There are lots of 
other ways in which we can contribute to helping to resolve it, 
but that will emerge from our discussions with the OAU, with the 
United Nations. We think there must be a regional approach to 
the matter. 
  [Robinson] Just quickly to get a picture of how many 
countries are represented in South Africa, how many 
representatives do we have abroad, and what are your priorities? 
  [Pahad] Well, at the moment we have diplomatic relations of 
one sort or another with 124 countries. We've got 68 embassies 
abroad, we have 25 consulates, and we have got 55 honorary 
consulates abroad. In this country we have 78 embassies, we've 
got 55 consulates, and 23 honorary consulates. So we've got 
quite a representation, and a lot of this has happened in the 
last few years as the democratization process started. 
  [Robinson] And it's still extending? 
  [Pahad] And it will extend. As we emerge out of isolation 
our interests change. We have to go to areas where we were 
never allowed in before -- the far East, Asia generally, Latin 
America, Central America, and the European Union of course. We 
now enter in a different way so we will then transform, we would 
like to believe, our own emphasis, given our own national 
interests. 
  [Robinson] What would you say is the priority in the 
Department of Foreign Affairs now? 
  [Pahad] Our priority is to consolidate our relation to the 
international community. Our priorities is how do we, 
interacting with the international community, ensure that we 
have a growing economy, and through a growing economy how we 
deal with the aspirations of our people, and through our own 
strength how do we help the region generally, Africa broadly, 
and then our contribution to the world. Our priority has to be 
to consolidate our role within the international community. 
  [Robinson] Well, thank you, Mr. Pahad. That's the basis for 
our discussion. I thank you for what you have said so far, and 
in a moment we will also speak to our other two guests.

  [Text] Cairo May 31 SAPA -- South Africa is planning to 
join the Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] at a time when the 
organisation's role is unclear. But SA [South African] Foreign 
Minister Alfred Nzo says membership is part of South Africa's 
strategy to end its international isolation. 
  Speaking in Cairo on the eve of a four-day NAM conference, 
Mr 
Nzo said international networking was critical for the success 
of his government's internal development policy: "The contact 
we have trade-wise and economic-wise with various countries of 
the world is bound to assist our process (of restructuring)." 
  According to Mr Nzo, South Africa is expecting to be 
accepted 
as an NAM member on Tuesday. He said that joining the 
108-member organisation was also a "natural development", since 
the movement had supported the anti-apartheid struggle and had 
given SA "liberation movements" observer status. 
  Mr Nzo is attending the summit in Cairo at a critical moment 
in the movement's history. The NAM was created in the 1960's to 
help developing nations assert their independence from the 
United states and Soviet superpowers. Now that the Cold War is 
over it is trying to recast itself as a pressure group fighting 
for third world interests. 
  The future of the movement is one of the items members are 
scheduled to discuss this week. They are expected to advocate 
focussing on "more of an economic role". 
  South Africa has also just been accepted into the 
Organisation of African Unity and Mr Nzo said it hoped to join 
the United Nations in the coming months. 
  The end of isolation means South Africa will be expected to 
get involved in efforts to contain regional conflicts, like that 
in Rwanda. Mr Nzo said that for now however his government 
would stick to humanitarian aid while it got its own military 
house in order. "We are engaged in the process of rebuilding a 
new army in our country...and we can't therefore be expected 
before that process is completed, to let our soldiers march (in 
peacekeeping operations)." 
  The Cold War superpowers, particularly the US, have 
traditionally barred NAM countries from developing nuclear 
weapons. Mr Nzo said South Africa would not use its nuclear 
capacity to equalise the imbalance in the nuclear equation but 
would "certainly participate in the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy".

<F P=106> [Interview with OAU representative in South Africa Sam Ebok </F>
by correspondent Thandeka Xhobule; place and date not given; on 
the "Agenda" program with introduction by announcer Freek 
Robinson--recorded] 
  [Text] [Robinson] South Africa's entry into the OAU will 
mean a great deal to that body, as Mr. Sam Ebok, representative 
of the Organization of African Unity in South Africa, explained 
to Thandeka Xhobule. 
  [Ebok] For 21 years of its existence, we as the OAU have 
confronted the problems in South Africa. At the first meeting 
of the OAU, one of the first decisions which was taken was that 
on decolonization and which led to the establishment of the 
Liberation Committee at the OAU. That committee has more or 
less attained its mandate having contributed to the 
decolonization process, and also in a very significant way to 
the ending of apartheid. That committee is winding up, so it 
means a lot to us who had been attached to it with a sense of 
nostalgia. It's like one era has ended. Now we would look 
forward to a period, you know, in which we can pursue economic 
emancipation with the same vigor that we have pursued the 
political liberation. 
  [Xhobule] Let's talk about current conflicts on the 
continent. With regard to conflicts happening in various parts 
of the continent at the moment, what role would you see South 
Africa playing? 
  [Ebok] One of the things which has impressed people all over 
the world, not just in Africa, is the way South Africans 
resolved their problems through negotiations. It has opened the 
doors to that possibility that every conflict could be resolved 
through negotiations, because I mean, if you look at it, when we 
came here about two years ago we never thought that the 
elections would come off so peacefully. A few months back we 
never thought that we would have such a peaceful election. So 
one of the things which South Africa had experienced, which 
South Africa would bring to the organization, are its experience 
in conflict resolutions. 
  [Xhobule] In practical terms, what would this entail both 
for 
the OAU and for South Africa? 
  [Ebok] Well, for the OAU it means that our membership has 
been enriched. South Africa comes to the organization with some 
leadership role. South Africa is a very advanced country 
technologically and even politically. And so those experiences 
are the experiences which we'll learn, which our organization, 
as we move into the 21st century....[pauses] For South Africa, 
I believe that for once it has stopped being the (?burial) state 
-- we will stop talking about South Africa in very negative 
terms at meetings of the OAU, and South Africa will be in a 
position to benefit from some of the experiences -- positive 
experiences -- which the rest of the continent has. It would be 
able to interact with the rest of the continent because South 
Africa will first be an African country before it becomes a 
member of any other international community. So for South 
Africa, it is back in the fold as a member of the family. It 
can reach out to the whole world from Africa as a legitimate 
entity, and that is the benefit for both of us.

sales as a responsible member of the world community and not to 
supply weapons to regimes which use them for oppression. 
Speaking at the South African Embassy in Washington Deputy 
President Thabo Mbeki said President Nelson Mandela would soon 
sign an agreement covering international regulation of missile 
delivery systems. Mr. Mbeki was reacting to questions about 
news reports in the United States that South Africa planned a 
sharp increase in its arms exports following the end of the arms 
embargo. He said South Africa had a strict policy not to send 
weapons to conflict areas in Africa. He said it was possible 
that South Africa could provide aid to Rwanda in the form of a 
military field hospital.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 30 SAPA -- A draft document 
approved by the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] as the 
basis for a national policy for the defence industry was 
released in Johannesburg on Monday [30 May]. The draft policy 
was produced by the TEC's sub-council on defence and approved by 
the TEC in April as the basis for the government's defence 
industry policy. 
  The document says that because the defence industry is one 
of 
the country's major assets "it would not be in the national 
interest to totally discard it". However, the new defence 
industry policy should be seen within broader political and 
moral considerations as part of the general industrial policy 
for manufacturing in South Africa. The draft document calls for 
retention of some of the defence industry's capabilities for 
military and security application, but also proposes 
diversification and conversion to meet civilian market needs. A 
diversification council has been recommended to encourage this. 
  According to the proposals, no new industry establishment, 
through state funding, should be undertaken where capabilities 
already exist in the public or private sector. 
  Central to the new defence policy is the retention of 
research and development spending at the current level of R420 
million [rand] a year. Unless the expenditure is maintained the 
industry will lose its technological edge and much of its design 
and development capabilities, the working document states. A 
joint management system has been recommended for technology 
development and to co-ordinate long-term planning of all 
military research and development. The draft proposals say the 
state should encourage industry to invest in defence research 
and development. 
  Turning to an arms trade policy, the proposal includes the 
development by the Defence Ministry and the approval by a 
parliamentary defence sub-committee of guidelines regarding 
customers of conventional armaments. A list of recipient 
countries should be approved by a cabinet committee. Armaments 
should be sold only to recognised governments and not to 
guerrilla or other movements, the document proposes. 
  It also says South Africa should refrain from trading in 
weapons of mass destruction, while the present system of arms 
trade control should be rationalised. The Defence Ministry 
should control all arms exports and imports and related 
technology transfers on behalf of the government. Wherever 
possible, South Africa should reveal the type of products it 
sells and who its clients are by contributing to the United 
Nations conventional arms registers -- provided trading partners 
approve of such disclosures. 
  According to the proposals, South Africa should no longer 
strive for complete self-sufficiency in arms, as this is neither 
affordable nor necessary. In certain areas the policy should be 
to purchase overseas, in others to procure on a competitive 
basis, while in strategic areas limited self-sufficiency should 
be maintained. 
  Turning to the acquisition of defence systems, equipment and 
services, the working group recommended the Defence Ministry 
should be responsible for planning and budgeting for the SA 
[South African] National Defence Force. Certain regulatory and 
policy-making functions currently performed by Armscor should 
also be handled by the ministry. 
  The draft also proposes greater transparency and 
accountability to parliament, the public and to the 
auditor-general. 
  Speaking at a news briefing in a Johannesburg hotel, Dr 
Andre 
Buys, the convenor of the TEC working group that produced the 
proposals, stressed the document was merely a draft. It was 
being submitted to an open, public debate where it should be 
considered in terms of South Africa's security, socio-economic 
and industrial policy requirements. This was a move away from 
past policy-making behind closed doors, he said. "We are 
inviting criticism and debate in the spirit of democracy," Dr 
Buys said.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Ionno] </F>
  [Text] General Georg Meiring is the ultimate professional 
soldier: conservative by nature but innovative; authoritarian 
but adaptable. 
  He is not doctrinaire except on the issue of defence force 
standards. 
  For a man labelled a hardliner he has shown a remarkable 
capacity for flexibility. The "reality" to which he refers 
constantly is about cold assessment, not the heated passion of 
ideology. 
  Yet his reconciliation with the ANC, his transformation from 
hawk to dove, after years of full-blooded confrontation is one 
of the miracles of transition. 
  A clue to how this leopard changed his spots to win the 
confidence of his former enemies is in the first lines of a 
ground- breaking paper he presented in November, setting out his 
vision for the future of the defence force. 
  "It is a reality that if one does not plan one's own future 
that someone else may do it for you and you may not like what 
you eventually get," he said. 
  The paper, emphasising legitimacy, high standards of 
preparedness within a non-threatening posture, acceptance of 
integration and commitment to national development helped settle 
the controversy around his appointment to succeed General Kat 
Liebenberg as Chief of the SADF [South Africa Defense Force]. 
  There was never any doubt that General Meiring is ideally 
qualified. His 30-year experience is unusually broad, and it 
was accepted that he commanded the loyalty of the SADF and could 
be counted on to pull it through what was widely expected to be 
a turbulent and violent election. 
  The distrust was understandable. The NP [National Party] had 
tainted the SADF's protestations of no political allegiances by 
keeping it in reserve, out of negotiations. It was perceived as 
the white minority's ace in the hole. 
  These perceptions of partiality were underlined by General 
Meiring himself. In a series of unsubstantiated allegations 
about MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe; Spear of the Nation; ANC military 
wing] plots and in his outright resistance to integration of MK 
into the SADF he stood against the ANC. 
  Part of the miracle is the speed with which trust has 
developed between General Meiring and Mr Joe Modise, the new 
Defence Minister. Direct contact between the SADF and Umkhonto 
we Sizwe was forbidden until April last year. 
  In taking the job in the face of Mr Modise's plans to 
establish a civilian department of defence which will be 
responsible for policy, personnel and finance, General Meiring 
has tacitly accepted that his power will be diluted. 
  Georg Lodewyk Meiring was born in Ladybrand, in the [Orange] 
Free State platteland, on October 18, 1939. His five-year 
service contract will keep him employed past the usual defence 
force retirement age of 55. 
  General Meiring's advisers refused to allow an interview for 
this profile, but a handful of his past and present 
general-staff colleagues were prepared to discuss Meiring the 
man on condition that they were not identified. 
  All seized on his scientific background -- he received an 
MSc 
(physics) from the University of the Free State in 1962 -- and 
his military origins in signals as key factors in his 
development. 
  "His only problem is that he is a signaller," said a 
headquarters colleague. "It is always a challenge for someone 
who does not come from a fighting arm, infantry, to take 
command. It just isn't done. 
  "His strength is that he is a realist, a soldier who 
appreciates that you can only achieve limited objectives by 
military action. 
  "The fact that he was given a fighting command in South West 
(Africa) from 1983 and stayed until 1987 is an indication that 
Constand Viljoen and Jannie Geldenhuys had discovered somebody 
special in Georg Meiring. He was being groomed from the early 
days." 
  He is a challenging taskmaster. "He tends to think like a 
scientist, he does things systematically and he expects the same 
from his subordinates," said one of his advisers. 
  "He tends to be quite far ahead of anybody speaking to him. 
Sometimes it's most distracting. If you are talking rubbish he 
knows it long before you do. 
  "He is not one of those people who thinks he knows it all, 
but if he does appreciate something you have done he is a bit 
shy about revealing it. 
  "He is not a relaxable kind of person. There is always some 
tension about him. Even when I socialise with him I am always 
sitting on the edge of my chair." 
  A rare glimpse of gentleness behind the steely facade is 
revealed in a long letter replying to a 14-year-old student's 
request for personal details from his hero. "If you accept 
challenges, believe in yourself and in God, you will make a 
success of your career," General Meiring told the lad. 
  Soothing the boy's fears, General Meiring wrote: "It is 
wrong to speak of the `new South Africa'. There will be changes 
in the political and legal terrain, but this does not mean we 
will find ourselves in a new land. 
  "We in the army realised a few years ago that there would be 
changes in our land. We could have ignored the signals, behaved 
passively and hoped for the best. We felt that was not what we 
should do." 
  These are the words of a pragmatist. As the defence buckles 
down to historic change, he will see it through, even if it was 
not of his choosing. General Georg Meiring will do his duty.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 29 SAPA -- Self-Defence Units 
(SDUs) would be disbanded and their members disarmed, according 
to an African National Congress proposal put to SDU 
representatives at a meeting in Kathlehong township on the East 
Rand on Sunday. ANC regional deputy secretary Obed Bapela said 
SDU members between 13 and 18 years old would go back to school. 
  A special catch-up programme for these youths was being 
negotiated with PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
education authorities, he said. Those between the ages of 19 and 
24 should be accepted as police reservists in a neighbourhood 
watch. Other members should join the police force. 
  Mr Bapela said these two proposals were still being 
negotiated with regional police authorities. Those who did not 
want to go back to school should join what he called the police 
academy. 
  He said SDU members were being debriefed to inform them of 
recent political developments. 
  The disarmament programme, he said, was in line with the 
ANC's policy of strict gun control limiting firearm ownership to 
one per person. All illegal weapons would have to be taken from 
criminals, SDUs and armed hostel residents, Mr Bapela said. 
  He said he hoped a law on gun control would be passed in the 
regional Parliament by September.

<F P=106> [By David Isaacson] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 29 SAPA -- Self-Defence Unit [SDU] 
members could be incorporated into the South African Police 
Services [SAPS] if African National Congress proposals are 
accepted by police and SDU members. The proposals on the 
disbanding and disarming of SDUs were given to SDU 
representatives from nine East Rand townships at a meeting in 
Katlehong on Sunday [29 May]. 
  ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Deputy 
Secretary Obed Bapela outlined the proposals as: 

  -  providing special catch-up schooling to SDU members 
between the ages of 13 and 18; 
  -  accepting those below the age of 25 as police reservists in a 
neighbourhood watch programme; 
  -  and integrating others into the SAPS. 


    He said this would have to be negotiated with regional and 
national authorities, and that the current matric qualification 
for policemen would have to be addressed. 
  "Some of the people...have got some experience of policing 
(by)...patrolling our streets to ensure that people sleep 
peacefully... 
  "In the army, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (the 
ANC's military wing) through negotiations were able to take a 
lot of people without matric who have joined the national 
defence force. 
  "And...we feel strongly that members of the SDUs have to 
play 
that role (in the police)." 
  The ANC also proposed a police academy and service brigade 
to 
train and use people in areas such as electrical and civil 
engineering. 
  SDU members would be debriefed to update them on recent 
political developments, Mr Bapela said. 
  He said SDU representatives, who would report to the ANC on 
June 19 after consulting their members, had welcomed the 
proposals which, he said, were in line with the ANC's plans for 
strict gun control measures in the PWV. 
  The disarming of SDU members, criminals and "impis [group of 
warriors] in hostels" would operate voluntarily and in 
conjunction with an amnesty, Mr Bapela said, adding that this 
would have to be discussed with authorities. 
  Mr Bapela, who recently announced a "one person, one gun" 
policy in the PWV provincial legislature, said licences would be 
issued to people only on merit. 
  People entitled to guns would include policemen, reservists, 
soldiers and those living or working in dangerous areas. 
  PWV MEC [member Executive Committee] for safety and security 
Jessie Duarte attended the meeting, but only in her capacity as 
an ANC regional executive member, Mr Bapela said.

  [Text] Pretoria May 27 SAPA -- A second assembly point has 
been set up for former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- 
ANC military wing; MK] and Azanian Peoples Liberation Army 
[APLA] soldiers at Hoedspruit in the Eastern Transvaal. 
  Members of the armed wings of the African National Congress 
and the Pan Africanist Congress would arrive shortly from 
Tanzania, said Lt-Col Brian du Toit, media spokesman of the 
Joint Operations Centre at Walmanstal. 
  Walmanstal, north of Pretoria, was the first base activated 
to train non-statutory force (NSF) members for eventual 
integration into the South African National Defence Force 
[SANDF]. 
  An advance party of the Walmanstal non-statutory forces had 
been sent to Hoedspruit to assist in preparation of the assembly 
point. They would complete their orientation training together 
with the new arrivals, Col du Toit said. "Once the process of 
documentation and initial training has been completed suitable 
candidates will be offered a service contract with the SANDF and 
will then proceed with his/her career training." 
  A joint operations centre consisting of SANDF and NSF 
personnel had been established to co-ordinate all queries, 
control and disciplinary actions at Hoedspruit, Col du Toit 
said. The Hoedspruit base would eventually accommodate 1,500 
troops, he added. 
  Col du Toit told SAPA about 6,400 soldiers were currently 
accommodated at Walmanstal and "things were running pretty 
smoothly". 
  The third base earmarked earlier as an assembly point, 
Bourke's Luck, would not be activated because it was not 
economically viable, he said.

  [Text] The ANC has appointed a committee to begin drafting 
legislation to outlaw discrimination in banking. This could 
include forcing banks to disclose details of loans and deposits. 
ANC Banking and Finance President (Leo Morrison) says an act to 
this effect is to be tabled soon for discussion. He told a 
conference in Pretoria that a similar act in the United States 
had virtually outlawed discrimination by banks on the basis of 
gender or race. Banks there were obliged to disclose detailed 
information on deposits and loans by bank branches. Details of 
rejected loan applications, for example for mortgage bonds by 
members of specific communities, were also made public. Mr. 
(Morrison) said the American legislation could provide the basis 
for similar legislation in this country.

<F P=106> [Report by Ken Daniels on the "Newswrap" program] </F>
  [Text] The dispute in KwaZulu/Natal over the allocation of 
portfolios in the provincial executive has been resolved. After 
a meeting between Dr. Frank Mdlalose of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] and Jacob Zuma of the ANC, the two leaders announced at a 
media conference in Pietermaritzburg today that a satisfactory 
solution had been found. The only outstanding issue is the 
question of control of the police. Vusi Sithole is on the line 
with details of the agreement. 
  [Begin recording] [Sithole] We asked them about the police 
portfolio, which had been the bone of contention, and they said, 
unfortunately, there were certain issues in the constitution 
which did not allow them to proceed with some of the matters 
that they would have loved to finalize today, but that [passage 
indistinct] 
  [Daniels] Is it more favorable to the ANC? 
  [Sithole] What we got from Mr. Jacob Zuma was that they were 
happy with the agreement that they had reached. 
  [Daniels] So what is the new allocation with the crucial 
portfolios? 
  [Sithole] OK, the portfolios stand like this: Mr. Jacob Zuma 
is going to take on the portfolio of economic affairs and 
tourism, and then the portfolio of public transport and control 
is Mr. S'bu Ndebele, and Dr. Zweli Mkhize will head the health 
services portfolio here. 
  [Daniels] Now some of the Inkatha people that have lost 
their 
portfolios now -- what's going to happen to them? 
  [Sithole] We, unfortunately, could not get anything out of 
Dr. Mdlalose about that, save to say that agreement has been 
reached and that everybody was happy with the latest 
arrangement. Dr. Mdlalose said that now Natal -- KwaZulu/Natal 
-- had a chance to pick up where it had ended and was looking 
forward to a very bright future for the province, and that they 
were going to do their best to make this work. [end recording]

  [Text] Durban May 30 SAPA -- KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank 
Mdlalose announced on Monday [30 May] evening that his 
provincial cabinet had been finalised after a meeting in 
Pietermaritzburg. In a statement Dr Mdlalose said: "I'm pleased 
to announce that the political impasse regarding the allocation 
of portfolios...has been resolved." 
  On the face of it there appeared little change to the 
cabinet 
announced last week and to which the African National Congress 
objected, but Dr Mdlalose said the central government would be 
approached about the appointment of additional deputy MECs 
[members of the executive council]. 
  The only change to the 11-member cabinet was the allocation 
of the economic affairs and tourism portfolio to KwaZulu/Natal 
African National Congress leader Jacob Zuma. He was originally 
given the social welfare portfolio which was changed, without 
consultation according to him, to public works. Mr Zuma said on 
Monday he was satisfied with his new duties. "It has been 
resolved satisfactorily ....We've got an agreement," he said. 
  The ANC leader reaffirmed Dr Mdlalose's statement, saying a 
clause in Monday's agreement mandated central government to 
appoint deputy MECs, some of whom would be ANC members. 
Provincial governments do not have the power to do this. He 
said according to Monday's agreement, the ANC would be given the 
important post of deputy MEC of police, if central government 
approved the joint request. 
  The three ANC cabinet members are expected to be sworn-in on 
Thursday. They boycotted the original ceremony because of 
dissatisfaction over the provisional portfolio allocation and 
subsequent changes. 
  The final KwaZulu cabinet is as follows: 

  -  George Bartlett, agriculture (National Party) 
  -  Senzele Mhlungu, finance (Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]) 
  -  Peter Miller, housing and local government (IFP) 
  -  Celani Mtetwa, police (IFP) 
  -  Nyanga Ngubane, conservation and traditional authorities 
(IFP) 
  -  Gideon Zulu, social welfare (IFP) 
  -  Vincent Zulu, education and culture (IFP) 
  -  Jacob Zuma, economic affairs and tourism (ANC) 
  -  S'bu Ndebele, roads, transport and traffic control (ANC) 
  -  Zweli Mkhize, health (ANC) 


    Dr Mdlalose is the 11th member of cabinet.

<F P=106> [Article by Farouk Chothia and Ann Eveleth] </F>
  [Text] A break has opened up between Zulu king Goodwill 
Zwelithini and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as the 
monarch moves to adopt a non-partisan stance in the continuining 
conflict between Inkatha and the ANC in KwaZulu/Natal. 
  Sources close to the Royal House and the ANC leadership in 
the province revealed this week that Zwelithini, freed of his 
economic dependency on Buthelezi, had already taken several 
concrete steps to publicly demonstrate his independence. 
  This puts Buthelezi's self-style role as the king's prime 
minister -- and thus his traditionalist power-base in 
KwaZulu/Natal -- under threat. 
  Sources say Zwelithini has indicated Buthelezi will not be 
included in the Royal Council the king will form to advise him 
on political and other issues. 
  Zwelithini's absence from a ceremony last Friday in Ulundi, 
in which Buthelezi was to present the provincial cabinet to the 
monarch, was seen as a snub to Buthelezi. The ceremony went 
ahead in the presence of Prince Reginald. 
  Zwelithini was said to be ill. But Minister of Public Works 
Jeff Radebe said the king's absence had been no accident in the 
context of the ongoing cabinet crisis: Zwelithini had wanted to 
demonstrate his neutrality and aloofness from party politics. 
  In other shows of independence, the king has also: 
  -- Avoided attending public functions with Buthelezi since 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] announced its participation in 
elections. While Buthelezi held a victory rally two weeks ago, 
the monarch was locked in top-level talks with the ANC 
leadership in Nongoma. 
  -- A week after the election he attended the inauguration of 
a chief in Mthunzini without Buthelezi. 
  -- After a brief meeting with Mandela at the presidential 
inauguration in Pretoria, Zwelithini held another meeting with 
him the next day. The two reached an agreement which saw the 
KwaZulu Police [KZP] being replaced by the South African 
National Defence Force as Zwelithini's security personnel. 
Sources say Zwelithini believed the KZP "were spying" on him 
for the IFP. 
  Zwelithini's journey to Pretoria to meet Mandela without 
Buthelezi was interpreted as another act of defiance. Acting on 
advice from the Inkatha leader, the king had previously insisted 
that Mandela meet him in Ulundi. Zwelithini had ignored 
Buthelezi's appeals to him not to meet Mandela. 
  -- At Zwelithini's request, defeated ANC premier candidate 
Jacob Zuma and other ANC leaders in the province visited the 
Royal Palace in Nongoma two weeks ago. Several royal princes 
were also present, although those who have played a key role 
under Buthelezi's government were absent. 
  Sources said Zwelithini was being encouraged to break away 
from Buthelezi and the IFP by several members of the Royal 
House. These included non-IFP princes, some of his wives and 
some of his children. The Mail and Guardian is aware of the 
identities of those involved. Prince Petros Zulu, who was seen 
as an ANC sympathiser, was gunned down at his home in Ulundi 
last year. Sources said Zwelithini was deeply disturbed by his 
death. 
  In his strongest statement indicating ruptures within the 
Royal Household, Buthelezi appealed at last Friday's ceremony 
"to members of the Zulu Royal Household not to sabotage what we 
are trying to achieve for His Majesty, the institution of the 
monarchy, and the kingdom. I know that it was members of the 
Zulu Royal House who ended the life of our founder king, King 
Shaka ka Senzangakhona. 
  "It is strange that throughout history there are always 
coteries of the Royal House who take it upon themselves to try 
and undermine what is being done for the king and the kingdom. 
Your Royal Highnesses, do not allow history to repeat itself." 
  Two weeks ago Buthelezi said: "I am sad to tell you 
concerted efforts are being made to drive a wedge between me, as 
the king's traditional prime minister, and the king."

  [Text] Durban May 30 SAPA -- A government delegation 
including Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and 
Defence Minister Joe Modise visited KwaZulu/Natal on Monday [30 
May] to investigate the state of emergency and maintenance of 
safety and security in the province. A statement issued by Mr 
Mufamadi said the delegation, which included legal adviser to 
the state president's office Prof Fink Haysom, held discussions 
in Durban with the South African Police Services, the South 
African National Defence Force and local peace structure 
leaders. "As a result of these discussions, certain 
recommendations regarding the emergency and the general 
maintenance of safety and security in the province will be made 
to the cabinet soon", the statement said. 
  A state of emergency was declared in the region ahead of the 
April election to ensure free and fair polling. 
  Monday's visit came a day after six partygoers were 
massacred 
in the Midlands. Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said the six 
were killed at about 3.30PM in Gulube location, mid-Illovo, 
about 100km north-west of Durban in the Umbumbulu area. "We 
believe the motive for the killing was related to faction 
fighting in the Umbumbulu area," Maj Naidoo said. 
  Police were investigating a possible link between the 
slaying 
and the weekend murder of Mr Jabulani Mnyandi, 24, also in 
Gulube. The names of the six killed are Mfayo Ndlovu, Mzayisini 
Ndlovu, Mtholoselwa Ndlovu, Gizi Luthuli, Eric Luthuli and 
Msongelwa Mgcongo. The deaths bring to 28 the number killed in 
violence in KwaZulu/Natal at the weekend, more than half of them 
on the north coast. Among those killed were four people slain 
in the Matholamnyama area, north of Durban, early on Saturday in 
an attack by the Maqadini tribe. Spent cartridges from 
automatic weapons were found at the scene. Police attributed 
the killings to a faction fight. 
  Murders were also reported from the north coast areas of 
Ubombo, KwaMbonambi, Mtubatuba, Esikhawini, Nyoni, Stanger and 
Umhlali. There were also killings in Durban and its surrounding 
townships of KwaMashu, Ntuzuma, Umlazi, and KwaMakutha on the 
south coast. 
  Mr Mufamadi said although there had been a general drop in 
violence countrywide, the situation in KwaZulu/Natal was "far 
from normal". He urged all political organisations and their 
leaders to co-operate fully to normalise the situation in the 
province. 
  On the role of security forces, Mr Mufamadi said: "I wish to 
make it perfectly clear that, to be effective, policing must be 
implemented without fear or favour. Furthermore, in the 
execution of their duty, it is expected that the security forces 
will maintain the highest possible standard of impartiality". 
  He said for normality to return to KwaZulu/Natal it was 
essential that all its citizens -- regardless of their political 
affiliations -- have confidence in the new SAPS. 
  Another issue raised during discussions was the perception 
that perpetrators of violence went unpunished. "Therefore, an 
indispensable condition for normalising the situation in the 
province was effective policing", the statement said.

  [Text] Durban May 30 SAPA -- Defence Minister Joe Modise 
and Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi met 
KwaZulu/Natal police and army chiefs in Durban on Monday [30 
May] to discuss violence in the province. Government spokesman 
Craig Kotze said in a statement "intensive talks" were held 
between Mr Modise, Mr Mufamadi, legal adviser to the state 
president's office Prof Fink Haysom and the province's police 
and army leaders. He hinted the state of emergency in the 
region might be lifted, saying the issue had been discussed and 
recommendations would be made to the cabinet. 
  The talks with SA [South Africa] Police Services regional 
commissioner Lt-Gen Colin Steyn; KwaZulu Police commissioner 
Lt-Gen Roy During; SA National Defence Force commander Dion 
Ferreria; and Provincial Peace Accord Chairman M C Pretorius, 
were initiated by central government. Mr Kotze said they arose 
out of concern about the levels of violence in the region, and 
resolved that policing must be seen to be implemented without 
fear of failure and impartially.

  [Text] Premier of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging], Mr. Tokyo Sexwale, received an unexpectedly 
cordial welcome at three violence ravaged IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] hostels on the East Rand. Mr. Sexwale was greeted with 
the title of Big Induna [chief] as an honor when he promised 
residents that their place of residence would be improved and 
upgraded. Totsi Msomi reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Msomi] Khumalo Street in Thokoza has been 
until recently a no go area. Shooting incidents took place 
daily and many people died in battles between the ANC and 
Inkatha. However, a new beginning was made today. Tokoza's 
community -- hostel dwellers, ANC and Inkatha supporters lined 
Khumalo Street to welcome Premier Sexwale. Residents of the 
Kwamadala Hostel also welcomed Mr. Sexwale's message of 
reconciliation. 
  [Sexwale, in English] We are saying, all of us are now 
working together. Nobody, nothing, must break the unity that we 
are building today. 
  [Unidentified resident, in English] We are tired of what has 
happening before and that we are looking forward to come 
together and build our nation.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 27 SAPA -- The PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] housing and local government 
ministry said on Friday [27 May] it had noted with great concern 
the alarming upsurge in land occupations in the province. The 
areas affected included Vanderbijlpark, Johannesburg, Nancefield 
and Randburg, the ministry said in a statement. "The ministry 
recognises the deprivations of the past and the shortages of 
houses for the majority in the PWV region. But it is of the 
view that such campaigns were aimed at the previous government, 
which closed all avenues of addressing basic and fundamental 
demands of our people." 
  A new situation had developed in the country. A government 
elected on the basis of the will of the people was now firmly in 
power, and it had stated publicly its commitment to the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme which would ensure the 
basic demands of the people were met. "The ministry, with the 
private sector, is in a process of developing a programme aimed 
at alleviating the housing shortage in our province. In this 
regard, the (provincial) government has committed itself to 
providing 150,000 housing units in this current financial year." 
  The ministry believed continued occupations might lead to 
unnecessary tensions, fuel animosities and create a climate 
conducive for third force elements to exploit and undermine 
programmes of the democratic government. "The ministry will 
organise an urgent meeting with all interested parties to seek 
ways and means of resolving the current impasse and to ensure 
the development of a people-centred programme to alleviate the 
problem. In this context, the ministry appeals for a moratorium 
on new land occupations pending the outcome of such 
consultations. The ministry will also hold urgent discussions 
with the Transvaal provincial administration to ensure an end to 
the harassment of our people."

  [Text] Kimberley May 30 SAPA -- Kimberley is to remain the 
capital of the Northern Cape, SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] Radio News reported on Monday [30 May]. Northern 
Cape Premier Manne Dipico said during the second sitting of the 
provincial legislature that there was consensus Kimberley should 
be the legislative seat of the province. 
  It was also recommended the province should have four 
official languages: English, Afrikaans, Tswana and Xhosa. 
  Mr Dipico said in his opening address he was satisfied with 
the boundaries of the region but would appreciate it if parts 
like Namaqualand and Kuruman remained part of the Northern Cape. 
According to legislature these parts can decide by referendum if 
they want to form part of the Northern Cape or not. However, 
the premier appealed to people living in these regions not to 
consider a referendum but to remain part of the Northern Cape. 
  He said it was important that the mining industry should 
find 
ways of retaining the wealth generated within the province 
through job creation mechanisms by the development of allied 
secondary industries and local business. Mr Dipico said the 
Northern Cape Government had already started encouraging 
potential foreign investors to the province. The government was 
also determined to consider the provision of suitable housing 
for all its citizens a top priority. 
  He said a provincial policy on agriculture should be 
developed to encourage sustainable agriculture as the area 
displayed considerably low levels of agricultural potential. 
This was largely due to the shortage of surface water, and a 
drought management programme was essential. 
  Another matter which also needed urgent attention was the 
question of the landless. Vast tracts of productive land were 
held by the Defence Force. This land was needed and everything 
would be done to gain access to it to unlock the full 
agricultural potential of the province, Mr Dipico said.

<F P=106> [Article by Edyth Bulbring, Carmel Rickland, and Norman West] </F>
  [Text] Frustrated premiers in the nine provinces are 
demanding that the government urgently grant them the powers 
needed to end the "paralysis" in their administrations. 
  From May 10, when President Nelson Mandela was inaugurated, 
administration of provincial and homeland laws reverted to 
central government. 
  Until the president gives these powers, and several other 
functions the provinces are entitled to under the constitution, 
they are unable to govern. 
  Every function, from filling vacancies in schools to buying 
equipment, now requires the approval of the government. 
  "The whole system is as clear as mud at the moment. Premiers 
and executive councils cannot take a decision with any binding 
effect," one provincial official said this week. 
  "We want our powers. We are under enormous pressure to show 
our constituencies that we are effective governments and can 
deliver on the promises of the reconstruction and development 
programme," Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa said. 
  KwaZulu Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose said the delay was 
causing serious problems. 
  "The civil service is continuing but the direction that 
should be given by the ministers is hampered. Ministers are not 
really ministers without the powers that should be given to 
them," he said. 
  [Orange] Free State Premier Patrick "Terror" Lekota said it 
was impacting on his government. "Some questions coming from 
the ground -- I can't deal with them. People may want salary 
adjustment, or promotions," he said. 
  The provinces had to apply within 14 days of the election of 
their premiers for their powers and this was complied with. 
  However, at a meeting of the premiers with representatives 
from government in Cape Town on Wednesday, they were told there 
was a mass of red tape to unwind before they could receive any 
powers. 
  There appear to be two problems. The first is that the 
government has to decide which functions will be performed by 
itself and which by the provinces. Existing legislation needs 
to be deciphered and rationalised. 
  The second is that the provinces must have the structures to 
administer these laws. Crucial to this is the establishment of 
provincial treasury departments to control expenditure. 
  But there will first have to be a rationalisation of the 
central government, provincial and homeland civil services. 
  Sources at the meeting said the premiers were united in 
demanding their powers. They said that North West Premier Popo 
Molefe was "living" while PWV premier Tokyo Sexwale was 
frustrated. 
  They said Mr Sexwale told Public Service and Administration 
Minister Zola Skweyiya: "I left my legislature in the belief 
that I would receive the powers we need to show people that 
there is government in place that can attend to the needs of the 
communities. And here I am being told that more work needs to be 
done and am being sent back empty-handed." 
  A special commission on provincial government to assist in 
transferring powers was appointed on Friday. 
  Mr Phosa said he was governing in terms of the common law 
until the power were transferred. 
  "I am acting on the principle that the president would have 
behaved in the same way were he faced with the same problem," he 
said. 
  Mr Lekota said that while his government was being hampered 
by the lack of executive power, this was only a "passing phase". 
  He said a public service act, enabling the provinces to 
appoint staff and set up administrations, would be passed soon. 
  However, KwaZulu Natal MEC [Member of Executive Council] for 
Local Government and Housing, Mr Peter Miller, was less sanguine. 
  "The executive councils of all nine provinces have no power 
on any issue which is scheduled by the constitution to be in 
their competence. This is leading to a total paralysis in 
government. 
  "There isn't a clear understanding in certain areas that 
provinces are big government business and cannot be left in a 
vacuum," he said. 
  Western Cape Housing Minister Gerald Morkel said it appeared 
the transfer would be delayed until all the provinces had the 
necessary infrastructure. 
  "We are unhappy about his ... we can't afford to be tied 
down 
because of the incapacity of other provinces to handle 
functions," he said. 
  A provincial official said that the government would be 
holding meetings with the provinces during the next two weeks. 
A plenary session with the premiers will be held on June 9.

  [Text] Cape Town May 28 SAPA -- Leaders of the National 
Party's [NP] three new Cape provincial regions were elected at 
the 79th and last congress of the former Cape National Party in 
the Strand on Saturday. 
  Dr Dawie de Villiers, chairman of the NP's disbanded Cape 
Province structure and minister of environment affairs and 
tourism in the government of national unity, was elected leader 
of the NP's Western Cape region under the party's new federal 
structure. 
  Agriculture Minister and Senator Dr Kraai van Niekerk was 
voted head of the Northern Cape region, and Dr Tertius Delport 
as Eastern Cape leader. 
  The Cape National Party formally disbanded at its last 
congress on Saturday, when party delegates at the Strand Civic 
Centre unanimously adopted the NP's new federal constitution. 
Discussions on the draft provincial constitutions were 
postponed. 
  The three Cape provincial regions were to be formally 
constituted at congresses later this year, possibly in October, 
an NP source said. 
  The three new provincial leaders would constitute a 
committee 
to decide on the divisions of assets, liabilities and staff 
matters. 
  In his address, Dr de Villiers said the three Cape provinces 
had contributed 41.9 percent of the NP's total national tally in 
the general elections. 
  He said the system of proportional representation was good, 
but had also led to MPs being severed from their constituencies. 
  In future, magisterial districts should replace the old 
Westminster-type constituencies as the only logical and 
practical way around the problem of representation. One or more 
party officers should be appointed in each magisterial district. 
  The revamped structure of proportional representation should 
be verified when the country's final constitution was written 
over the coming two years. 
  Dr de Villiers said the NP had done better than expected in 
the "liberation elections", but had to get down to work 
immediately to start preparing for the 1999 poll. "The NP will 
continue to grow in strength and exercise its influence... Our 
values and principles are greater than any challenges and 
problems," he said to a standing ovation. 
  Western Cape Premier Mr Hernus Kriel was elected deputy 
chairman in the province, along with Mrs Maretha Badenhorst MP 
and Western Cape Housing Minister Mr Gerald Morkel. 
  Dr Delport's Eastern Cape deputy is Mr Tobie Meyer, with Mr 
Manie Schoeman, Mr Donald Lee and Mrs Ann Nash elected as 
vice-chairmen. 
  The Northern Cape vice-chairmen are Mr P W Saaiman, Mrs 
Peggie Hollander and Mr Jan Brazelle. 
  Dr de Villiers said he had experienced some longing and 
nostalgia at the end of his five years as leader of the Cape NP 
-- and as one of only five leaders to have led the party in the 
former province in the past 79 years. 
  The party faced big and difficult challenges. As a member of 
the government of national unity it would also serve as the 
oppositon, and would have to carry its supporters. 
  It had to be more responsive to the communities it 
represented and be more than just a political party. 
  Dr van Niekerk proposed that the three new provincial 
structures continue meeting every two or three years. "People 
should not be discouraged, or think we are doing a mopping-up 
operation; we are busy establishing South Africa on a new 
footing." 
  Dr Delport said, "as Christians, we make room and welcome 
others, but the NP cannot move from the basic values which it 
built over so many years. We must make sure that it is the 
party which wins the 1999 elections."

  [Text] Cape Town May 29 SAPA -- The National Executive of 
the Labour Party [LP] had agreed that the party should be 
disbanded, LP spokesman Mr Peter Hendrickse said on Sunday [29 
May]. He said the decision, made at a weekend meeting of the 
executive in Cape Town, would be put before a special congress 
of the party in about three months for ratification. 
  He also said that his father, Senator Alan Hendrickse, had 
stepped down as leader of the party. Mr Miley Richards would be 
acting leader until the congress. 
  Senator Hendrickse had told a party congress in December 
that 
he wanted to stand down, but had been persuaded to stay on until 
after the election. 
  Mr Hendrickse said only congress had the power to decided to 
dissolve the party. The NEC [National Executive Committee] 
recommendation would in the meantime be circulated to all 
regions for discussion. "It was felt that the party had served 
its purpose, fighting for the realisation of a non-racial 
democratic South Africa," he said. "Having attained those 
objects there was no need for the party to continue as a 
separate body." 
  The LP, founded 29 years ago, stood in the April election as 
part of the ANC alliance. Mr Hendrickse said there had been 
talk in the party for the past two years that it should disband. 
There were however supporters in the Western Cape in particular 
who felt very strongly that it should not. "But at the end of 
the day the NEC recommendation to congress will be that the 
party be dissolved," he said.

  [Text] Cape Town May 27 SAPA -- When Mr Justice Johann 
Kriegler went on the air to announce the final result of South 
African's first fully democratic election, he did not yet have 
the final data in his hand, he revealed on Friday [27 May]. 
  Addressing a Cape Town press club lunch, Judge Kriegler, 
head 
of the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] which ran last 
month's election, said because the provincial legislatures had 
to be constituted the next day, and inauguration day had been 
set for the next Tuesday, "we simply had to go public on the 
available data at that stage". 
  He believed that in future South Africa should have a 
permanent, parastatal, non-political electoral body to run 
future elections. The country could "simply not afford" to have 
10 different (one national and nine provincial) administrations 
running a poll. "We will need suckers like Kriegler to be the 
watchdogs of the public," he added. 
  Asked whether he would do it again, he gave a tentative 
"yes" 
but added immediately "but I'm not volunteering for any job!" 
The experience he and his commissioners had picked up should 
not be wasted. 
  Answering another question, he revealed that the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP], the Freedom Front and the National Party 
had been the three parties to temporarily benefit from a three 
percent mark-up following the IEC's computer programme failure. 
  A basic problem encountered by the IEC in the whole 
electoral 
process had been that "we were supplying an over-sophisticated 
system to a society that couldn't handle it". "We had a Rolls 
Royce system for a dirt track." 
  No deal or agreement struck between parties to expedite a 
result had been brought into the IEC's calculation. 
  Lessons learnt from the election included that never again 
should a poll be run without a voters' roll, and there should be 
a permanent professional staff, timeous preparation and no 
last-minute changes such as the entry of the IFP six days before 
election day. 
  It was still true, however, that the election had worked. He 
said he was satisfied there had been no significant evidence of 
any material irregularities in the KwaZulu-Natal area which had 
affected the result.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Opposition to Taxes Criticized -- "The perpetual 
handwringing 
of the country's richest people, who seem to regard any taxation 
as though it were a flesh-gobbling virus, is becoming tiresome," 
begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 29 May in a 
page-18 editorial. "The latest burst of neurotic anxiety arises 
from speculation .... that President Mandela intends to impose a 
surcharge of 10 percent on the taxes of the wealthy." The 
editorial continues then by discussing the economic pro's and 
con's of increased taxes, concluding that it is unlikely that 
Mandela or Finance Minister Keys would impose such a surcharge. 
"Why, then, the continual bursts of hysteria from the whites?" 
"It is hard to explain, except in terms of neurotic guilt. 
People who feel they have been unjustly enriched by apartheid 
perhaps feel that the victims of apartheid will, sooner or 
later, exact revenge. There is a simple answer to these 
anxieties: it is what, in a different age, was called noblesse 
oblige, or the obligation of the privileged to put back into 
society some of the fruits of their good fortune. The policies 
outlined by Mr Mandela are benign and reasonable," and "if the 
hangwringing classes want to avoid special taxes and levies, 
their best course of action is to seize the RDP [Reconstruction 
and Development Program] as an opportunity, and make it work." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Editorial Warns Against `Exaggerated Expectations' -- "What 
happened in the National Assembly this week was a remarkable 
display of national unity and the honest desire for peace and 
prosperity to reign in South Africa. All parties went out of 
their way to show their loyalty to South Africa and to commit 
themselves to a better standard of life for all people in the 
country," notes a page-14 editorial in the Johannesburg RAPPORT 
in Afrikaans on 29 May. "Even President Mandela said he would 
go down on his knees to beg for peace. Beautiful -- but the 
sober observer cannot help but wonder how long this peace will 
continue." "It is said that President Mandela's speech was 
better received in Houghton and Constantia than in Guguletu and 
Soweto. Elements within the ANC view the president's policy 
speech as a deviation from the socialist route and as pandering 
to whites and the business community. Black critics of 
President Mandela say, and not without grounds, that peace can 
only be maintained if the government succeeds in meeting the 
demands of its millions of young supporters." "It is clear that 
there are exaggerated expectations of the economy. To mention 
one example: Economists agree that there is no way Mr. Joe 
Slovo will be able to build as many houses over the next five 
years as he had promised to do." "During a visit to South 
Africa two years ago, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the man who helped to 
turn Singapore into an economic miracle, warned against high 
expectations. Like the ANC his party also entered into an 
alliance with the communists." "ANC supporters will have to 
heed his advice. First look for stability through proven 
economic policies."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Question of Amnesty Viewed -- "That Mandela and Terreblanche 
meet and talk is good. But what they have to talk about gives 
cause for concern," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
on 30 May in a page-14 editorial. "Terreblanche wants amnesty 
for a bunch of rightwingers who have perpetrated awful 
atrocities after the current deadline," and "to enter into 
discussions with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] on this 
issue is to dignify his cause with a status it does not 
deserve." Presenting another side of the argument, the 
editorial states that "morally, amnesty is no more or less right 
for today's cases than it was for the Strydoms and McBrides." 
"But we do not believe that amnesty needs to be extended so far 
as to cover crimes committed after inclusive negotiations began 
in earnest in 1992. To do so is to fly in the face of 
commitments given at the time, to cheapen the sacrifice of those 
who died and to further the impression that life is cheap in 
modern South Africa." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Question of Amnesty Viewed -- "Justice Minister Dullah Omar 
probably had no option but to formalise the trading of indemnity 
for information about those events," begins the Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 30 May in a page-12 editorial. The 
editorial adds that "several commissions either failed to 
uncover evidence or had it hidden from them, and even the 
Goldstone Commission has been only partially successful in 
peeling open layers of deceit." Mandela's government is 
partialy discussing amnesty in an attempt to "heal the wounds of 
the past, to allay fears of retribution and to join former foes 
in building a new country." However, "a willingness to forgive 
is matched by a determination not to forget; linked to both is 
the necessity to know why things were done, but whom on whose 
orders." Concluding the editorial writes that "what Omar has not 
said is when the process will stop, when the indemnity date, 
originally set at October 1990, will not be advanced for any 
reason. Killers must lose their political excuse, and police 
know that prosecuting criminality is not a waste of time. The 
transition cannot go on forever."

  Judge's Decision in Goniwe Inquest Viewed -- "The feeling of 
deja vu, considering the historic times we are in, sits rather 
uncomfortably on the half-expected findings of the now notorious 
Goniwe Inquest," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 
30 May in a page-12 editorial. Such findings "were par for the 
course" in the past. Now, however, it "defies all reason."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  CITIZEN </H8>
  Amnesty Issue Viewed -- "The question of amnesty has never 
been satisfactorily dealt with," begins the Johannesburg CITIZEN 
in English on 30 May in a page-6 editorial. Responding to 
recent talk of extending the cut-off date, the editorial writes 
that "since we never accepted amnesty for `political' crimes, we 
are not enamoured with the idea of any new cut-off date. It 
means there will be no end to the political violence if people 
or organisations think they can get away with the killing or 
maiming of innocent people for `political' reasons." Justice 
Minister Omar "says the government is considering a commission 
which will facilitate disclosure and acknowledgement within a 
framework that provides amnesty, justice and dignity. We hope 
that what Mr Omar has in mind is not the `truth commission' 
advocated by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone." "We would rather 
not have a truth commission but an end to the Goldstone 
Commission's probes, an end to trials that can only result in 
amnesty, and a final, firm cut-off date that will not be 
adjusted." 
<H8>  ILANGA </H8>
  Action Against ANC's SDUs Urged -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 
23-25 May in a page-8 editorial says that "the killing of 12 
people in Thokoza Township in the past week is an abomination 
like all such incidents in the past. This killing happens at a 
time when many people in the country had hoped that the violence 
would abate following the first democratic election in the 
country." "The emerging truth shows that the Thokoza killings 
are the result of infighting among members of an ANC brigade 
known as the self-defense unit [SDU]. Reports say members of 
this unit have turned into thugs fighting for supremacy." "The 
ANC must disband this unit as it is now obvious that its members 
are mere thugs. If it supplied them with arms, these must now 
be taken from them promptly. They are nothing but criminals." 
"To those that were pointing fingers at other political groups 
over the killing of the 12 people, what have they got to say now 
that the truth is out? Let them comment!" 
  Furor Over Land Issue Viewed -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 
26-28 May in a page-4 editorial notes that "the matter of land 
given to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini should not be manipulated 
to create bad relations within the leadership of the new South 
Africa. It should not be used to create unnecessary noise. 
Those that do not love peace should not be allowed to use this 
matter to create division, more especially now that the violence 
that has gripped this country shows signs of abating." "It is 
encouraging to hear that President Nelson Mandela and Home 
Affairs Minister Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi discussed the matter 
amicably." "It must also be remembered that the land given to 
His Majesty has always belonged to the Zulu nation. The British 
usurped the land from the Zulus when they were conquered. 
Actually, there is nothing amiss in the land being given back 
to the rightful owners." "Therefore there is no need for any 
furor."

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The battle for the Liberian town of Tubmanburg has 
reached a crisis. It is a stronghold of Alhaji Koromah's 
Mandingo faction of the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia] movement. They have been fighting 
Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn group since a power struggle erupted 
in March. The United Nations and ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force have been 
powerless to stop it, and civilians have inevitably been caught 
in the crossfire. Now it looks as though Roosevelt Johnson's 
forces are poised to capture the town. From Monrovia, our 
correspondent, Nii Nartey Allison, telexed this report. 
  Diplomats and military sources today said that 700 soldiers 
loyal to Roosevelt Johnson launched a major attack on Tubmanburg 
at 6 AM yesterday morning. United Nations officials here said 
that UN observers in Tubmanburg are still holed up in their base 
on the outskirts of the city as sporadic gunfire echoes 
throughout Tubmanburg. They said there were heavy casualties on 
both sides, and dozens of civilians trying to escape the 
fighting have been killed in the crossfire. The situation still 
remains unclear. 
  A spokesman for the ECOMOG peacekeeping force said today 
that 
their troops which had deployed southwest of Tubmanburg have 
been drawn into the fighting following an attack on its base by 
one of the ULIMO factions. Yesterday, Alhaji Koromah's faction 
accused the African peacekeeping troops of siding with the 
Krahns in the ULIMO conflict, but the ECOMOG commander in charge 
of Western Liberia, the Nigerian, Kunle Togun, told reporters 
that he was not surprised by the accusation because the same 
allegation had in the past been made by the Krahns. 
  Unconfirmed reports said the commander of the Mandingo 
faction, General Mohamed Dumbuya, was killed last night in a gun 
battle. Roosevelt Johnson, leader of the Krahn faction, told 
reporters late last night that he was compelled to move on 
Tubmanburg to stop the killings of innocent people by the 
Mandingo tribe. The World Food Program said here today that 
fighting in Tubmanburg has disrupted food distribution to 20,000 
people living in Tubmanburg. 
  We have just heard from Nii Nartey Allison that Tubmanburg 
has fallen to Roosevelt Johnson. He says Alhaji Koromah's 
faction has moved its headquarters to Voinjama in Liberia's 
northern Lofa County. He also says that Alhaji Koromah has 
denied that his trusted field commander, Mohamed Dumbuya, has 
been killed.

  [Text] Aldomiro Vaz da Conceicao, spokesman for the 
Presidency of the Republic, said in Luanda today that power 
sharing must not be applied in Angola. Aldomiro Vaz da 
Conceicao said this when commenting on the instructions the 
president of the Republic gave the government negotiating team 
to respond positively to proposals made by the mediators in the 
peace talks in Lusaka. 
  The spokesman of the Presidency of the Republic said peace 
accords will allow UNITA elements to hold government posts, but 
that will not mean power sharing. 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] We can only speak of power 
sharing when there is a coalition government where all political 
forces are on an equal footing and charged with the task of 
implementing a joint political and economic program, resulting 
from an agreement between the various forces. That is not the 
case here in Angola and as such that situation will not be 
observed. UNITA elements will hold government posts at the 
central and local levels, but they will have to implement the 
program of the government of the party that won legislative 
elections. [end recording]

  [Begin Abraao recording] The political and military

  [Text] Pretoria May 28 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, 
Afrikaner National Front] Chairman Ferdi Hartzenberg on Saturday 
[28 May] said he and President Mandela had agreed that the same 
norms would be applied to deal with outstanding cases of amnesty 
for rightwingers that had been used in the case of the African 
National Congress. Dr Hartzenberg told a news conference he 
intended to raise the amnesty issue again at his meeting with Mr 
Mandela in Pretoria on Monday. 
  It might be necessary to adjust the cut-off dates contained 
in legislature for amnesty, Dr Hartzenberg said. 
  Distancing the AVF from violence, Dr Hartzenberg announced 
that the organisation would establish a team to directly 
negotiate with the government on an Afrikaner Volkstaat 
[homeland]. 
  He was speaking after an AVF Executive Council meeting in 
Pretoria to review the AVF's position after the elections. A 
volks [people's] republic committee had been established to do 
the necessary planning and formulate input for negotiations, he 
said. 
  Dr Hartzenberg likened the position of Afrikaners to that of 
the Palestinians before their settlement, saying Afrikaners had 
lost their freedom and did not have a land. 
  The Afrikaner had two choices: They could struggle, destroy 
and use violence to reach a settlement or they could reach a 
settlement without following that route. "It would be wise 
(verstandig) to reach a settlement without violence." 
  During negotiations with Mr Mandela, they agreed that this 
was the correct method, Dr Hartzenberg said. 
  Asked why the AVF did not join General Constand Viljoen's 
Freedom Front [FF] to obtain a volkstaat through the "volkstaat 
raad" [homeland council] dr hartzenberg said the constitution 
and the April accord between the FF, government and the ANC, 
ruled out complete self-determination for Afrikaners. 
  Analysis of the votes cast during the elections indicated 
that more people abstained from voting than those who did vote 
for the FF route, he added.

  [Text] Cape Town May 27 SAPA -- South Africa has been 
formally invited to join the Southern African Development 
Community [SADC], Minister of Trade Mr Trevor Manuel said on 
Friday [27 May]. He was speaking after a lunch at Tuynhuys with 
an SADC delegation, which was also attended by President Nelson 
Mandela. 
  Mr Manuel said the purpose of the delegation's visit was to 
deliver a letter from SADC Chairman and Botswanan President 
Quett Masire inviting South Africa to "seek accession" to the 
SADC. "It's an invitation that is more than welcome," he said. 
It would merely formalise a de facto situation and the fairly 
strong relationship that already existed between most of the 
members of the government of national unity and the Frontline 
States. 
  The letter referred to the fact that an SADC summit of heads 
of state and government would be held in Arusha, Tanzania, on 
August 29. The formalities of South Africa's admission would be 
dealt with there. The delegation was led by Botswana's Vice 
President Mr Festus Mogae and SADC Executive Secretary Dr Kaire 
Mbuende.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 30 May (PANA) -- Burundi's Union for 
National Progress, Uprona, former single party, and the Party 
for the Reconciliation of the People, PRP, on Sunday [29 May] in 
Bujumbura gathered a crowd of supporters to express their 
disapproval of the "biased" way the UN representative is 
carrying out his duties. Shouting "Abdallah out" and "Burundi is 
sovereign and mature enough to dispense easily with your 
tutelage", the two main parties of the opposition expressed 
their dissatisfaction in front of the hotel where the UN 
representative, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, lives. As the OAU 
special representative, Senegalese Papa Louis Fall, who was 
forced to resign last March, Abdallah, a Mauritanian national, 
was also accused by the demonstrators of going beyond his duties 
of mere observer and facilitation in the restoration of state 
institutions. 
  The accusations of partiality are not new, but the last 
straw 
was, according to the protesters, Abdallah's plan to organize in 
Nairobi from 1 June a week-long international conference on 
democracy and security in Burundi. The meeting, to which all 
the members of Burundi's executive, legislative, and judiciary 
have been invited, has stirred fears for their safety. They 
said plans to "gather at the same time all the members of the 
Burundian cabinet in the same plane" were suspicious. 
  The UN representative came down to the hall of his hotel and 
asked to talk to the angry demonstrators. He said the 
demonstrators had a democratic right to demonstrate for action 
they deem right, but that it was also not right for them to 
accuse him without foundation. He said the Nairobi conference 
would be convened only if Burundi's main parties deemed it 
useful and wanted to attend. "I am not here to force anybody to 
act against his own will," he said. 
  Observers said that the same opposition through similar 
demonstrations forced the OAU secretary-general's special 
representative to Rwanda to resign.

  [Text] Ndjamena, 30 May (AFP) -- Libya on Monday [30 May] 
officially restored the Aozou Strip, a tract of desert territory 
believed to be rich in minerals, to Chad after a 22-year 
occupation, Chadian radio reported. The handover took place as 
planned at Aozou, a post in the territory of 114,000 square 
kilometres (45,600 square miles) which had led to war between 
the two nations in the past, the radio said. But it gave no 
details, citing an almost total lack of communications with the 
remote site. 
  The lowering of the Libyan flag in the Aozou Strip and the 
transfer to Chad follows a February 3 ruling by the 
International Court of Justice in the Hague, upholding 
Ndjamena's claim to the area. Guests invited to the ceremony by 
the Chadian Government, notably French troops and 
representatives of relief agencies, were flown to Bardai, about 
100 kilometres (60 miles) from Aozou, aboard French military 
planes, diplomatic sources in Ndjamena said. 
  France deployed a military air and ground force in Chad in 
1986, known as Operation Epervier (Sparrowhawk), to put an end 
to Libyan military offensives. The force is currently some 800 
strong. The programme for Monday's ceremony stated that it 
would be attended by Libyan Justice Minister Muhammad al-Hijazi, 
Chadian Interior Minister Abderamane Izzo and an official of the 
UN observer team that monitored Libya's withdrawal.

  [Excerpt] Tripoli, 31 May -- A ceremony carrying out a 
ruling on the Aouzou Strip by the International Court of Justice 
was held yesterday, following an agreement signed in Surt on 4 
April 1944 between the Great Jamahiriyah and Chad. 
  The ceremony was attended by the brother secretary of 
justice 
and public security, and by the ministers of interior, defense 
and trade from the Chadian side. The head of the UN observers 
also attended. 
  A joint declaration was issued on the occasion. It states 
that the International Court of Justice issued its ruling on the 
regional dispute between the Great Socialist People's Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriyah and the Republic of Chad on 4 February, 1994, 
and that in the realization that the Great Socialist People's 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and the Republic of Chad signed an 
agreement on 4 April 1994 on ways to implement the 
International's Court of Justice ruling, the Great Socialist 
People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and the Republic of Chad 
declare that the withdrawal of the Libyan administration and 
Libyan forces from the village of Aouzou is to begin on this 
day, 30 May 1944, in a manner acceptable to both sides and is to 
be made under the supervision of a UN observers' team. 
  This declaration was signed in the village of Aouzou today, 
30 May 1994. 
  The brother secretary of the General People's Committee for 
Justice and Public Order delivered a speech during the ceremony. 
He underlined that although the name of Aouzou used to 
represent a symbol for disunity, it can now be a symbol for the 
consolidation of solidarity and the boosting of ties and links 
between the two brotherly peoples in the Great Jamahiriyah and 
Chad. He indicated that for almost half a century, the village 
of Aouzou represented a symbol for a joint struggle to repel the 
colonialist invaders. 
  In his speech, the brother secretary said that although the 
colonialists did not settle in this land, they nevertheless 
established their presence by way of drawing maps of the area. 
The whole of Africa was a target for a deliberate and 
provocative policy of division aimed at sowing disunity among 
brothers and tearing apart the heroic bravery against 
colonialism. This region, alongside other regions in Africa, 
was part of this provocative division. To this day, other 
African areas continue to suffer from this divisionist policy. 
  He added that the colonialists used to exaggerate and stress 
this conflict between Libya and Chad, which hampered the march 
of all our peoples in Africa, and diverted Africa's attention 
from taking care of its matters and developing its resources. 
Colonialism erected a barrier between the two countries, which 
had a negative impact on cooperation between them. We are still 
seeing this policy in a number of African regions. 
  However, today, and following the taking of this brave step 
in opting to solve the conflict through peaceful means and 
through the International Court of Justice, we are taking a 
further heroic step, a step that shows our respect for the 
verdict of the International Court of Justice, a step that some 
so-called superpowers could not take. 
  Today, we give proof that solving a conflict can be reached 
through peaceful methods; through more effective and beneficial 
means. We show that whenever a judicial quarter specializing in 
areas of conflict gives its verdict, irrespective of the point 
of view expressed toward its decision, the parties should adhere 
to this ruling. This method is the fundamental foundation for 
establishing a new world order; the use of force, the imposition 
of or threats to implement political and economic sanctions will 
not provide solutions to the world's problems and difficulties. 
The only method is to solve conflicts via peaceful ways and 
through the UN Charter. 
  He added that the pronouncement of the verdict of the 
International Court of Justice, especially in a case like this, 
does not mean that there was a weak or a strong side, a victor 
or a vanquished, a winner or a loser. It means that a legal 
solution, irrespective of victory, defeat, gain or loss, had 
been found which solves a long-standing conflict, and turns the 
Sahara into what is was in the past: A land for harmonious ties 
and stability. 
  He stressed that the Great Jamahiriyah is setting the ideal 
example on respecting an important binding verdict, and that 
there is no other way for other states other than to heed this 
method for solving conflicts. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The situation remains very tense in Rwanda, where 
fresh negotiations opened this morning between rebels of the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and government forces. These 
negotiations under the mediation of the United Nations are aimed 
at achieving a cease-fire. Concerning today's negotiations, let 
us listen to the views of RPF spokesman Jean-Baptiste Gawumba: 
  [Begin Gawumba recording] Talks are also necessary to stop 
the massacres still prevailing in the country. We have always 
said that meetings between the RPF and government forces could 
help to stop the massacres and we continue to believe so. If 
there is a possibility of stopping the massacres to enable the 
people to live in security, well we believe it would have a 
positive effect on our country. [end recording] 
  While negotiations continue at Amahoro Hotel in Kigali, 
fierce fighting is taking place in the Rwandan capital. The 
RPF, which is seeking a position of strength, has increased its 
pressure on the contested interim government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kigali, May 30 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebel and army 
commanders agreed Monday [30 May] to allow the evacuation of 
civilians and to resume UN-brokered ceasefire talks on Thursday. 
  The accord was announced by the commanders after their first 
face-to-face meeting at the Amahoro Hotel. 
  United Nations troops meanwhile evacuated hundreds of 
civilians trapped for weeks behind the battlelines to safe 
areas, after an early morning delay caused by fierce artillery 
duels and difficulties in obtaining guarantees of security from 
both sides, UN officials said. 
  Mainly Hutu government supporters were driven in white UN 
trucks from the Amahoro stadium, in rebel-held territory, to 
government-controlled areas south of the embattled capital 
Kigali.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, May 29 (AFP) -- Fighting raged in Kigali 
on Sunday [29 May] on the eve of ceasefire talks between rebel 
and government forces, and the United Nations said part of the 
interim government had fled its base southwest of the capital. 
  The combat, sporadic but at times heavy, forced the United 
Nations to suspend its evacuation of civilians from Kigali, a UN 
spokesman said. 
  In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said 
some 400,000 Rwandans had fled the fighting in the capital: 
"They have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. It is a very 
grave situation," said ICRC spokesman Tony Burgener. 
  UN spokesman Abdul Kabia, contacted by telephone from 
Nairobi, said: "Our information is that a substantial number of 
government officials have left Gitarama for Kibuye (west) and 
Butare (south), but some are still there." 
  It was not immediately clear whether the interim Prime 
Minister Jean Kambanda was among the officials who reportedly 
fled. 
  The self-declared interim government fled Kigali on April 
12, 
and established its base near Gitarama, 50 kilometres, (35 
miles) southwest of the capital, after Rwanda Patriotic Front 
rebels launched an offensive on the city. 
  The rebels have been tightening their grip on Kigali over 
the 
past couple of weeks and are reported to have advanced within 
seven kilometres (five miles) of Gitarama. 
  There was also heavy fighting around the northern town of 
Ruhengeri, Kabia said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] forces have 
captured Nyanza military camp in Gitarama. Several government 
soldiers and civilians who have been imprisoned in the camp were 
set free. RPF forces have received cooperation of the residents 
in the area, who are handing over arms and ammunitions that were 
supplied by government functionaries. As RPF forces advanced 
toward the town of Gitarama, the self-imposed government is on 
the run to unknown destinations. Some sources say that the 
government may now be in the town of Kibuye near the Zairian 
border while others say that the government may now be in 
Gisenyi, also near the Zairian border. Some cabinet ministers 
have been sighted in the town of Gisenyi and others have already 
taken refuge in other countries, pretending to be on diplomatic 
missions. [passage omitted].

  [Text] The U.S. Government has finally allowed to support 
the UN Mission in Rwanda. The U.S. Government has set aside $35 
million to finance the UN Mission in Rwanda. Bill Clinton's 
government has also pledged to send tanks and transport planes 
for African troops to be sent in Rwanda as UN troops. U.S. 
Government has stated that they still maintain that UN Mission 
in Rwanda should be humanitarian. They still insist that UN 
soldiers should go to the border rather than go to the city 
center. However, this (?delayed) reaction from the UN Security 
Council, and the United States for that matter, is rather too 
late. 
  Earlier this week, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary 
general, told the international community that it is responsible 
for what is happening in Rwanda, that he had called upon 40 
countries to contribute to the UN 5,500 troops -- but only four 
countries have responded. So far, the countries which have 
agreed to send troops to Rwanda include Ghana -- which is to add 
to their 200 troops now in Rwanda to form a battalion of 800 -- 
Senegal, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe.

  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has reacted to the 
interview given by [French Cooperation Minister] Michel Roussin. 
In a statement, the RPF has denied that massacres took place as 
a result of the withdrawal of French troops last November. The 
RPF points out that there were a number of reports of massacres 
of civilians at a time when and in regions where French soldiers 
were present. The rebel movement also questioned how France 
could explain that it had evacuated only members of the former 
ruling party and refused to protect the family of the prime 
minister designated by the Arusha peace accords -- end of 
quotation.

<F P=106> [Interview with RPF Secretary General Theogene Rudasingwa by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "We Will 
Put an End to the Killing"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Relief organizations estimate that 
half a million people have been killed in the Rwandan civil war. 
Is the Tutsi tribe, who have been called the Jews of Central 
Africa, threatened with extinction? 
  [Rudasingwa] The genocide has almost been completed, except 
for the people who have managed to flee to neighboring 
countries. However, not only Tutsis have fallen victim to the 
massacres; the entire Hutu opposition has also been massacred. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, it was no classical tribal warfare? 
  [Rudasingwa] This is the cliche that the world likes to use 
too much: Hutus are massacring Tutsis in an outbreak of archaic 
hatred. This is so easy, because if this explanation is true, 
no one really has to feel responsible. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Who is really to blame for this blood-bath? 
  [Rudasingwa] Not the Hutus, but a dictatorial clique that 
wants to stay in power with its army, its militias, and its 
death squads. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But it is probably not a coincidence that 
these 
forces belong to the Hutu tribe. The Tutsis, on the other hand, 
were the ruling people in the past. Is this not a reckoning 
between master and servant? 
  [Rudasingwa] The fact is: Tutsis and Hutus managed to get 
along with each other for many centuries. They are linked by 
one language, one religion. Tensions began during the colonial 
era, when the Belgians used the Tutsi elite as collaborators. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rwanda became independent in 1962. You cannot 
still blame everything on the colonial powers. 
  [Rudasingwa] Our country's politicians are far more to blame 
than the Belgians, because they were only too happy to take over 
the colonial structures -- including the passports, in which 
one's tribe is noted. The Rwandan politicians have missed the 
opportunity to build a nation. They were interested only in 
their own privileges. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Corruption and the abuse of power also exist 
in 
other countries; still, there are no such horrible excesses 
committed there. 
  [Rudasingwa] Rwanda's ruling Hutu clique shamelessly 
exploited their tribal origins to achieve their political goals. 
The current war broke out at a moment when the old regime saw 
itself threatened by a new alliance between Tutsis and Hutus, 
who formed joint opposition parties. It is a struggle between 
democratic forces and dictatorship. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rwanda is the most densely inhabited country 
on 
the African continent. In addition, hundreds of thousands of 
Tutsis, some of whom had been driven out as early as in 1959, 
were preparing their return with the help of your liberation 
movement, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF. Are the massacres 
not also an expression of the quarrel over the scarce arable 
land, the struggle for survival? 
  [Rudasingwa] Overpopulation and scarce resources are 
certainly the main problems of our country. However, this is no 
reason to fan fear among the population and to refuse the return 
of the refugees. Rwanda's problems could be solved with a modern 
policy: We need better agriculture and a moderate form of 
industrialization. We have large nature preserves and hunting 
reserves that we should use for regulated tourism. However, the 
mountain gorillas must never be more important than the people 
in our country. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you disappointed that the international 
community is reacting with helplessness to the genocide in 
Rwanda? 
  [Rudasingwa] We do not believe that international 
organizations, such as the Organization of African Unity or the 
United Nations, can really help. Foreign troops have never 
managed to restore law and order in a country. After the 
debacle in Somalia, we want to accept no more than 3,000 blue 
helmets to guard relief convoys. If UN soldiers try to prevent 
us from defeating the dictatorial regime in Rwanda, we will 
shoot at them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your RPF, which is dominated by the Tutsis, 
has 
surrounded the capital city of Kigali. You can achieve a 
military victory, but what is going to happen then? Revenge on 
the Hutus? 
  [Rudasingwa] A predecessor of the RPF was founded by Tutsis 
in exile in 1979. However, fortunately, we are no longer a 
purely Tutsi organization. We are the only force that can put 
an end to the killing, and the Hutus, too, know that; they are 
just as much victims as the Tutsis. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How does a party that is considered to be a 
Tutsi movement want to rule in a country with a Hutu majority? 
  [Rudasingwa] We are not coming as conquerors. We are ready 
to form alliances with all parties that were not involved in the 
genocide. We want to prevent mass murders from being committed 
ever again in our homeland.

  [Excerpts] The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] president, His 
Excellency Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, visited the Rusumo area 
in Kibungo Prefecture, where he was welcomed by local senior 
army officers. 
  While at Rusumo, President Kanyarengwe was interviewed for 
one and a half hours by correspondents from Radio France 
International, Radio Burundi, Radio Tanzania, and Tanzanian 
newspapers, among others. Our Muhabura correspondent [name 
indistinct], was also present. 
  To the first question, concerning when the RPF would set up 
a 
government, President Kanyarengwe said that the war was 
continuing, but that the warring armies were going to meet to 
work out how to solve the problem of war. He said that in case 
the negotiations failed, the RPF would carry on with the war and 
capture the town of Kigali, as well as the entire country, and 
would then establish leadership. President Kanyarengwe said 
that the RPF would cooperate with those parties that stood for 
democracy in Rwanda and that it could not recognize the 
government of Kambanda and Sindikubwabo. 
  Concerning the war, President Kanyarengwe said the RPF 
forces 
were doing well. He said that they controlled more than half of 
Rwanda, and occupied important points in Kigali. 
  On the contributions of our neighboring countries to stop 
the 
war in Rwanda, President Kanyarengwe first thanked the countries 
that had accepted refugees, and the international community, 
which continues to support us. He called upon Zaire and 
Tanzania to continue their mediation efforts. 
  He also indicated that a meeting had been called by 
Tanzanian 
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and that it would take place in 
Tanzania. In short, he said, all the neighboring countries were 
helping us, and urged them to continue doing so. 
  The journalists wished to know if the Arusha agreements were 
still useful. President Kanyarengwe said the Arusha agreements 
would continue to be a crucial basis, especially with regard to 
the establishment of a leadership based on law, democracy, the 
unity of Rwandans, justice, and other priciples. Concerning 
justice, the agreement would ensure the punishment of all 
murderers. Correspondents also asked questions about intertribal 
relations in Rwanda. President Kanyarengwe said that the tribal 
question was just a pretext leaders use to manipulate the 
people, so that they could continue to cling to power, kill 
innocent people, and misinform the international community about 
Rwanda's real problems. President Kanyarengwe said the real 
problems of Rwanda were essentially political, because a clique 
wanted to grab the leadership and victimize innocent people. 
[passage omitted] 
  The journalists are also reported to have visited the 
Nyarubuye parish, where they saw an unbelievable number of 
bodies -- more than 20,000 of them. They were reportedly 
tongue-tied. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Marie-France Cros: "Kivu Affected by Rwandan </F>
Civil War"] 
  [Text] Will the Rwandan tragedy destabilize Zaire? Kivu is 
taking in Rwandan refugees and may be the crossing point for 
arms destined for the government camp in this country, despite 
the UN arms embargo. 
  According to the account of a Rwandan refugee at Goma (a 
Zairian town on Lake Kivu, opposite Gisenyi, a stronghold of 
Hutu extremists in Rwanda), Rwandans are making incursions into 
Zaire to carry off refugees and to take them back to the Rwandan 
side. We have been unable to obtain confirmation of this news, 
although rumors of such seizures are circulating among Goma's 
Zairian population. 
  One of the refugees, on the other hand, told LA LIBRE 
BELGIQUE that the Rwandans had come to Zaire to rustle cattle in 
the Bukombe district. Hutus coming from Rwanda are also said to 
have attacked three farms belonging to Tutsis in the Masisi 
region of Zaire. The owners are said to have killed some 
attackers and captured others. According to the same source, 
attacks have also taken place in the area of Rutshuru (a Jomba 
village) "but Ndeze, the Rutshuru's Hutu mwamui (editor's note: 
Member of the Republican High Council, the Kinshasa 
Parliament), is not letting these attacks develop, because he 
wants to maintain the tranquillity of the region." 
<H5>  Tension in Kivu </H5>
  Readers are reminded that the Kivu (Zairian region on the 
frontier with Rwanda and Burundi) has a native Rwandan-speaking 
population consisting of Tutsis and Hutus. The region, linked 
to the pre-colonial Rwandan kingdom, was annexed to the Belgian 
Congo by the colonizers, who also subsequently encouraged, in 
the '30s, an immigration of workers from Rwanda. Successive 
waves of political and ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi 
since their independence have added refugees coming from these 
countries. In 1992-93, the Kivu was the scene of bloody 
outbreaks of violence between Rwandan- speaking natives (Hutus 
and Tutsis) on the one hand, and non-Rwandan speakers 
(principally Behunde and Banyanga) on the other. 
  A Rwandan-speaking Zairian source indicates that South 
Kivu's 
Governor Keymbwa Walumona, who is a protestant pastor, has 
driven back to their own country Rwandans fleeing the prefecture 
of Cyangugu, where Tutsis and the Hutu opposition have been 
massacred. Privately, the governor is said to have indicated 
that these were instructions "from above," in other words from 
President Mobutu. Certain people believe such an order to be 
unlikely since North Kivu is welcoming refugees without 
difficulty. 
  A Zairian source not from the region has indicated to LA 
LIBRE BELGIQUE that tensions between Hutus and Tutsis, already 
sensitive within the Kivu due to the ethnic clashes in the 
neighboring countries, have grown with the present Rwandan 
crisis, and that Kinshasa's policy was therefore rather to 
receive Tutsi refugees in South Kivu (Bukavo, Uvira) and Hutu 
refugees in North Kivu (Goma, Masisi, Rutshuru). A DSP (Special 
Presidential Division) has been installed "between the two (Kivu 
provinces)," in particular in the region of Masisi and along the 
frontier, from Rutshuru to Uvira. 
  However, the welcome by South Kivu's governor to the Rwandan 
Tutsis seems pretty reticent, judging from a European source at 
Bukavu (capital of the province). This source added that 
"trading in property stolen" from the victims of the anti-Tutsi 
and anti-Hutu opposition pogroms in Rwanda was taking place in 
Bukavu, where Rwandan military had received the governor's 
"authorization to come and gather supplies," and was taking full 
advantage of this. 
<H5>  Arms Traffic </H5>
  Another area of Zairian involvement in the Rwandan crisis: 
arms trafficking. According to information gathered by LA 
LIBRE BELGIQUE, an air cargo company landed a cargo of arms at 
Goma airport "on a Thursday, one week after President 
Habyarimana's death" (that would be 14 April). These arms were 
transported on 10 trucks belonging to local traders (Zairians 
and an Indian), and then escorted to Gisenyi, an area in the 
hands of Rwandan Government forces. In early May, a Bulgarian 
plane landed 42 tons of arms at Goma, which were immediately 
loaded onto Rwandan military trucks. In general, these 
transhipments are said to have taken place at night, at a rate 
of one a week, and from aircraft of different origins, in 
particular from Nigeria. Last Monday 23 May, a Zairian Army 
C-130 and a cargo plane from the same air freight company as the 
one mentioned above landed at Goma at 0000 GMT, according to 
eyewitnesses. At 0200 GMT, the crates were loaded onto two dump 
trucks and a Toyota truck belonging to the Zairian Army, en 
route for Gisenyi. The load must then have been transported via 
Lake Kivu as far as Cyangugu and, from there, by road toward 
Butare and Gitarama, a region that could be the next objective 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front guerillas. 
  We questioned Zaire's ambassador in Brussels about this 
trafficking. Mr Kimbulu told us that "Zaire is a mediator (in 
the Rwandan conflict) and cannot therefore allow one of the 
parties to be favored."

  [Text] The main trade union, the Federation of Chadian 
Trade Unions, has decided to continue its strike as long as 
workers' salary demands are not met. Here is Chadian Prime 
Minister Kassire Koumakoye on the labor unions' demands. 
  [Begin Koumakoye recording] The labor unions demanded 35 
percent. However, I should tell you that under the current 
budget adopted by our parliament, in view of the devaluation, we 
unblocked salaries so that there was a 20-percent increase. 
Nonetheless, I believe the trade unions are right because the 
devaluation was a disaster for our countries and people's 
purchasing power was reduced by half. But, I also believe that 
being nationalistic is being realistic, since they know our 
country's problems. We have initiated negotiations to reach an 
agreement. As we have said, nothing is impossible to Chadians. 
We will succeed in making our national problems understood. I 
am still convinced that together with the trade unions we will 
be able to work out a national compromise. [end recording]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 31 May (AFP) -- At least 72 automatic 
pistols and 14,000 pieces of ammunition were stolen by 
unidentified persons on the night of 29 May at the Gamboma 
military headquarters, in central Congo, it was learned today 
from military sources here. A commission of enquiry comprised of 
Army and police officers is expected to leave today for Gamboma, 
a town located 300 km north of Brazzaville, the same sources 
added. 
  Gamboma is a stronghold of the Congolese opposition 
coalition. Early this year, opposition militia stole a large 
quantity of arms and ammunition from the noncommissioned 
officers' school there. At the time, President Pascal Lissouba 
accused, without mentioning any names, a senior Army officer of 
having approved of the theft.

  [Excerpts] A meeting between government forces and the 
Rwandese Patriotic Army [RPA] took place yesterday at the UNAMIR 
[UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] headquarterss in Kigali. The 
RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] delegation was led by Colonel 
(Frank Mugambage), while the government forces were represented 
by Brigadier General Marcel Gatsinzi. Brig.-Gen. Andoh, deputy 
UNAMIR commander, chaired the meeting. The meeting was aimed at 
cease-fire negotiations. This was the second time the two 
antagonistic forces met since fighting resumed early last month. 
After seven hours of discussion, the meeting ended with no hope 
of a cease-fire agreement in the next few days. [passage omitted] 
  During yesterday's meeting, the two sides agreed to continue 
the exercise of exchanging civilians who are caught behind 
frontlines. A similar meeting between government forces and the 
RPA is expected to take place on Thursday [2 June] this week.

  [Text] Our colleague, (Mwene Bukungu), reports that, from 
Bugesera to Rwabusoro, the people all say the same thing: 
Nothing will happen to us because the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] is already here. On the way to (Munya), after crossing a 
bridge destroyed by government troops in an attempt to halt the 
advance of the RPF, one finds that many people are returning to 
their homes. Along the way, the bodies of government troops can 
be seen on the tarmac. On the way to Nyanza, people say [words 
indistinct]. They also say that they are happy that RPF troops 
are in the area. People say they have (?seen) the discarded 
military uniforms of government soldiers. One such found was 
for a [name indistinct] Gaspard, No. 31173, who hails from 
Kidaho commune, in the (Gisare) sector, Ruhengeri Prefecture. 
He threw away his star, his shirt, trousers shoes, socks, and 
fled. The people say that that is what the government troops 
are doing. 
  In our efforts to rescue Rwandans, RPF troops have freed 800 
prisoners, soldiers and civilians, who were jailed in Nyanza. 
Up through last night, RPF soldiers have been attempting to 
rescue people who had taken refuge in attics, where they are 
still hiding. Operations are under way in Nyanza, whether in 
(Mugangamure) or (Mugunzi). There are many injured people in 
the hospitals.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rene Degni-Segui, special rapporteur of the </F>
UN Human Rights Commission for Rwanda, by correspondent 
Jean-Karim Fall in Abidjan on 31 May; from the "Afrique Midi" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fall] You are the UN special 
rapporteur for Rwanda. What does it really mean? What will you 
do? 
  [Degni-Segui] I have been appointed to investigate. 
According to my mandate I must see if these acts really took 
place and who the perpetrators of these acts are, I must 
establish the link between these acts and those who are 
suspected of being the perpetrators. This is my mandate. I will 
not be alone in this. I assume that the whole UN structure and 
all UN personnel there will help me. 
  [Fall] What will your agenda be? Will you travel to Rwanda 
soon? 
  [Degni-Segui] Yes. I believe that this is urgent because I 
was given four weeks to draw up a first report. I received a 
call from Geneva and I must leave for this long journey, for a 
meeting of university deans and continue therafter to Rwanda, 
but with stopovers in Geneva and Brussels. 
  [Fall] Degni-Segui, you are the dean of Abidjan Law Faculty. 
The possibility of an international tribunal for Bosnia was 
mentionned. It is now being mentionned in the case of Rwanda. 
Can you define this notion of international tribunal? 
  [Degni-Segui] Let's say that it is a matter of setting up an 
ad hoc structure with the task of trying those suspected of 
being responsible for the crimes. [passage omitted] 
  [Fall] Last year you took part in -- you chaired -- an 
international commission in Rwanda. What were your conclusions 
at the time? 
  [Degni-Segui] I must say that I did not chair the 
international commission of enquiry. Our conclusions covered 
three points: genocide, war crimes, and the impotence of the 
judiciary thus guaranteeing complete impunity to the 
perpetrators of these massacres. [passage omitted]

  [Text] First to Rwanda. The warring sides have begun a 
process that is hoped will end the fighting which has left an 
estimated half million people dead. Representatives of the 
rebel and government armies held their first direct talks on 
Monday [30 May] to discuss the draft cease-fire prepared by the 
UN Mission in Rwanda. Meanwhile, there have been reports of 
continued fighting and dramatic movement of refugees. The 
Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] 
says the situation is getting worse by the hour. Dateline 
[Swiss Radio current affairs program] asked ICRC representative 
Tony Burgener about the importance of the talks on the 
humanitarian situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Burgener] What we can hope is one point, 
that definitely the humanitarian issue is brought up 
immediately. I mean that it has to be--that it is going to 
be--separated from the political talks, that this one is taken 
into consideration. There are hundreds and thousands people now 
stranded. They need assistance. We, the international 
organizations, have to be enabled to bring in the food, the 
water, the medical assistance, whatever is needed, to these 
people. This has to be a point that has to be treated with 
first priority. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have contacts with 
either side in your efforts, in your program--relief program? 
  [Burgener] Of course, we are working in full transparency 
with both sides. We are informing them [of] whatever we are 
doing. This is absolutely necessary. We have to start talks on 
high level with authorities on either side and this of course we 
hope, facilitates our work also in the coming days, and that 
also the awareness of the humanitarian disaster which is taking 
place, not only in the area of Gitarama, of course. There are 
other areas also in the FPR [Rwanda Patriotic Front] zone, where 
hundreds and thousands of people are displaced, where also help 
is needed. All this, of course, needs the full understanding of 
both parties. 
  [Correspondent] What are the main difficulties in getting 
supplies to the refugees? It seems that air supplies are 
irregular at best coming into Kigali. What are the main 
difficulties? 
  [Burgener] Well, it's even difficult to talk about about 
main 
difficulties. I mean, it's almost absolutely impossible to 
bring in anything to this area right now since the roads are 
blocked, the airport does not work, and after all when you see 
this huge quantity of people who are staying around there--half 
a million people--to find supplies for them is very very 
difficult, the logistical problems which we are faced to [as 
heard], all this gives us a real, real headache. It's very, 
very difficult to bring in whatever they need, and they need 
just everything. They need food, they need water, they need 
medical assistance, they need also sanitary equipment because 
there is a risk of epidemics. The only way to do it would be 
probably from the western side, from Kibuye [on the shores of 
Lake Kivu facing eastern Zaire], towards Gitarama. This road is 
still open and we definitely will try our best to do whatever we 
can do. 
  [Correspondent] Now, the thing is, Gitarama is a target for 
the rebels in the fighting. How secure is Gitarama as a refugee 
point? 
  [Burgener] Well, first of all, there is no way for them this 
time to get out of this area. There is no other possibility to 
go whatever place if it's not Kibuye. Definitely those who can 
go further on of Gitarama they will try to do it. From that 
point of view it's very important that both parties, all parties 
understand that the humanitarian issue is very important, that 
it has to be given priority when they are meeting today. [end

  [Text] Kinshasa, 31 May (AFP) -- The national committee of 
Etienne Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress, 
UDPS, the main radical opposition party in Zaire, today 
criticized France's activities in Rwanda and its "accomplice," 
Mobutu. 
  In a communique, the UDPS criticized the "cynical" support 
by 
French leaders, from both left and right, to former President 
Habyarimana's "criminal policies," and stressed that it is 
advisable "to point out the highly negative role played by 
Mobutu, the accomplice of French imperialism, in the name of a 
badly understood and poorly assimilated so-called francophone 
movement." 
  The statement continued: "The UDPS stigmatizes the hypocrisy 
of both France and Mobutu, who are indecently trying to cover up 
their crimes by organizing a meeting in Nairobi on 6 June (...)." 
  Finally, the UDPS "condemns in the strongest terms the 
presence of Mr. Mobutu and France at this ill-timed meeting in 
Nairobi, and called on its fighters in Kenya and on all justice, 
democracy, and peace-loving persons to prevent, by all means, 
the holding of this parody, which is a disgrace to Africa." 
  Newspapers close to the radical opposition also took up 
these 
attacks against France, criticizing France's African policy in 
general and accusing it of continuing to "support dictators."

  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. George Cosmas Adyebo, has 
received a special envoy of President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, 
sent to deliver a special message to President Yoweri Museveni, 
now on a working visit in Europe. Lieutenant General (Arnold 
Piano), a former commander of the Ghanaian Armed Forces and 
first commander of the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force in Liberia, 
handed the message to the prime minister in his office in 
Kampala today. Lt. Gen. (Piano), who was accompanied by Ugandan 
minister of state for defense, Mr. Amama Mbabazi, and Brigadier 
General (Ajerufra Francis), who is the chief of staff of the 
Armed Forces of Ghana, told the prime minister that his team had 
been sent on a special mission to Uganda by President Rawlings, 
in connection with the situation in Rwanda. He said the team is 
interested in knowing the views of Rwanda's neighbors about what 
should be done to settle the Rwanda crisis. 
  During the meeting, the Ghanaian delegation was briefed 
about 
the stages Uganda has taken toward the solution of the conflict 
ever since the war began. 
  The meeting also pointed out the necessity of an 
intervention 
force which must be agreed upon by the two warring sides. The 
meeting agreed that the force must only go for humanitarian 
reasons such as escorting food convoys and to provide security 
and not to engage in disarming or confronting one of the warring 
sides.

  [Text] Pretoria May 31 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela and 
some of his colleagues are positive that the Afrikaner nation 
should be accommodated, Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- 
AVF] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said on Tuesday [31 May]. 
  He told a news conference at Donkerhoek the AVF's aim was to 
come to a settlement on an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] within 
the next two years while the new constitution was being 
finalised. 
  He was very satisfied with negotiations with the government 
so far, he said. The forum created for negotiations on a 
volkstaat between the AVF, Freedom Front [FF] and the government 
was a peaceful route to attain the volkstaat goal. 
  Ethnic violence was the most important source of violence 
and 
it was necessary that this be addressed to secure investments, 
he added. 
  More and more people realised and supported the idea that 
the 
Afrikaner nation should be accommodated for a permanent 
solution, he said. At least two-thirds of Afrikaners wanted 
self-determination, also a "substantial number" of National 
Party supporters, he claimed. 
  If the Afrikaner nation was free it would put "everything 
into it" to develop the nation and the country as a whole. 
  There were many practical problems to attain a volkstaat but 
those should be solved through negotiations, he added. "We have 
always preferred the peaceful option". 
  The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement] was 
not taking part in the activities of the AVF, he said. 
  Signs were there that the volkstaat ideal would bring the 
nation together. 
  After a report-back to his constituency, Dr Hartzenberg 
would 
contact FF leader Constand Viljoen about the tri-partite 
negotiations forum for a volkstaat. 
  Very few people attended the Republic Day festivities at the 
Radio Pretoria premises at Donkerhoek, but Dr Hartzenberg 
ascribed this to poor publicity. 
  Ds Mossie van den Bergh, Radio Pretoria management committee 
chairman told SAPA at the gathering that the station would 
consider undisclosed "alternative methods" if the broadcaste? 
had not been granted a licence by the end of June. 
  The station was in the process of applying for a licence to 
the Independent Broadcast Authority. "We decided to obey the 
rules and play the game until the end of June. If it seems our 
efforts to obtain a licence are unsuccessful we will consider 
alternative methods," he said.

  [Text] The decision by the HNP [Reformed National Party] 
not to participate in the Mandela election is already yielding 
fruit. Whereas General Constand Viljoen compromised himself by 
his part in the election, so that he was under obligation to 
attend Mr. Mandela's inauguration, the HNP still stands aloof. 
This stance gives it inner strength, with the result that it 
can now embark on future plans without any prejudice. The 
political struggle will now be transformed into a people's 
[volk] movement. The recent election has clearly drawn the 
dividing lines between right and left, between those that voted 
and those that did not vote. Those that did not vote are 
physically and spiritually geared to continue the struggle. 
  Mr. Marais stated in a circular to party members that the 
veil has been lifted from the future the HNP is facing. This 
future will be based on the principles of healthy nationalism in 
which the HNP has firmly embedded itself since its creation. 
This will now be given new content. 
  The HNP will enter the new phase of the struggle under the 
motto: "Reconquer, Regain, Repair." 
  Mr. Marais states his case as follows: "The emphasis will 
henceforth fall more strongly on the sentiments and values of 
Afrikaner nationalism -- the Afrikaans language, the history of 
our people's heroes, and the basic rights of a nation." 
  Mr. Marais further quotes from H.T. Colenbrander to indicate 
that the onslaught against the Afrikaner has not subsided: "The 
world has, despite the peace accord of 1902, not finished 
dealing with the Afrikaner." He continues: "The struggle for 
the existence of the people -- which did not start yesterday -- 
is not ending tomorrow....A tree with such roots does not get 
pulled out of the ground easily. It might be standing bare 
without any leaves due to an unfavorable season, but the sap 
still goes up the stem and again it will have bear blossoms." 
  Mr. Marais is very determined that the HNP will continue to 
work against the situation brought about by the reforms of Mr. 
John Vorster, P.W. Botha, and F.W. de Klerk's "National" Party. 
Right now there are new obstacles in the struggle, such as the 
Bill of Human Rights and the interim constitution, but this will 
not deter the HNP from the task at hand. He pointed out that 
the HNP previously also had to put up with laws that impeded the 
struggle. This did not discourage the HNP, and it will once 
again continue, just as it has done over the past 25 years. 
  The whites presently find themselves in a similar situation 
as the Boers found themselves after the Second War of 
Liberation. They were impoverished and decimated by the British 
massacre of 26,000 women and children in concentration camps. 
Again they are impoverished and deprived of tens of thousands 
of children and potential mothers through a drop in the birth 
rate. The Afrikaner's struggle, however, had never been based 
on the power of numbers, but rather on the faith we have in our 
course, on our confidence in the God of our fathers, and on the 
courage and the will of the minority to continue the struggle."

<F P=106> [From the Commentary column] </F>
  [Text] The entire current political scene is symbolized by 
the position of Finance Minister Derek Keys, with one of the 
country's most dogmatic communists, Alec Erwin, as his deputy. 
This shows very distinctly what Mr. Mandela thinks of the 
National Party, and also what he thinks of the whole foreign 
financial world whose perception of the new South Africa has 
risen and dropped in accordance with reports the political 
future of Derek Keys. Every report that hinted that Keys was 
not going to be reappointed to the cabinet led to a drop in the 
price of stocks; each assurance that he would be part of the 
cabinet had the reverse effect. 
  Mandela has reappointed Keys minister of finance, but at the 
same time shackled his hands and feet. Erwin will want about 90 
million rands over five years for the ANC's Reconstruction and 
Development Program [RDP], an entirely unproductive so-called 
investment in people, but in actual fact a bonus for ANC 
supporters as reward for their political support. 
  It is an African application of the American principle of 
spoils [preceding word in English] after every presidential 
election -- an America political tradition for a century and a 
half. "To the victor belong the spoils," [quoted passage in 
English] President Andrew Jackson said. He dismissed all civil 
servants and place his own supporters in their positions. 
  Mandela has applied this even more literally; he regards the 
state treasury as his "spoils." Out of tax money, the ANC will 
help itself to 1.8 billion rands -- no real productive 
investment -- under the hundreds of little headings of the RDP 
program. The white man will just have to pay, and the 
"deprived" will stand and wait with open hands. Erwin will 
"propose" and Keys will sign on the dotted line. Keys will 
have to be content with the shackles, or else he will have to 
leave, whether Zurich and London like it or not.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page; article published in </F>
English] 
  [Text] The uproar over the transfer of KwaZulu communal or 
tribal land to a trust headed by His Majesty the King of the 
Zulus is a dramatic illustration of the perverted morality that 
pervades our country's propaganda organs. 
  For decades politicians have told us that the land issue was 
at the root of the opposition to racial discrimination and 
Apartheid. 
  Even the most politically illiterate politicians or 
journalists bewailed the fact that only 13 percent of South 
Africa was available for use and occupation by the African 
people. 
  These were the miserable bits of land that remained after 
the 
conquest of the African people. These were the so-called 
"Reserves", "scheduled areas" or "homelands" of the various 
tribes. 
  Even the most oppressive White governments promised not to 
take away these lands from the King, Paramount chiefs, and 
chiefs who administered the lands in accordance with the 
hallowed principles of African customary law. 
  Throughout the negotiations politicians of all parties gave 
"assurances" that the communal land system would be safeguarded 
and that the position of traditional leadership would be 
preserved. Any doubts expressed by anyone were met with 
indignant and vehement denials combined with hypocritical 
expressions of respect for traditional rulers. Numerous 
meetings were held in which traditional rulers were told that 
their interests would be safe under the government of national 
unity. 
  When His Majesty the King of the Zulus demanded actual legal 
and constitutional guarantees it was alleged that His Majesty 
was acting as a pawn of Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, President of 
the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. Expensive advertisements 
presented the so-called "offer" of "power" to the King. It was 
pointed out that His Majesty did not want anything personal but 
that the issues were those of the Kingdom, communal lands and 
judicial powers in terms of customary law. Much verbal 
propaganda and even abuse followed the rejection of the 
inadequate ANC "offer". 
  The KwaZulu Legislative Assembly in the exercise of its 
legitimate constitutional powers transferred the KwaZulu 
communal lands to a Trust with His Majesty the King as the sole 
Trustee. 
  This is not only in accordance with modern law but 
represents 
the position in indigenous customary law. The law passed by the 
KwaZulu legislature was submitted to the then State President 
for signature and became law. In this way the communal lands 
continued to be the property of the Zulu people and the status 
quo on land was preserved. 
  The furor that has broken out has been extremely revealing. 
We are now told that the object was to place communal lands in 
the hands of the state for purposes of distribution! We had all 
along believed that distribution meant taking land from the rich 
and giving it to poor black farmers. 
  State land is governed by Roman-Dutch law principles. 
Communal land is governmed by African customary law. At a 
stroke of the pen the World Trade Centre negotiators by 
"sufficient consensus" gave all the communal lands in South 
Africa to the central state. 
  We all owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the KwaZulu 
Legislative Council for doing their utmost to safeguard the 
communal lands. In so doing they have exposed the hollow 
hypocrisy of those who have shouted from the housetops that they 
respect the King of the Zulus and all other traditional rulers 
and chiefs. 
  The wholesale movement of millions of people to the cities 
that would follow state manipulation of communal lands would 
render the impractical Reconstruction and Development Programme 
even more difficult to fulfill. 
  Instead of the partisan castigation of KwaZulu and its 
leadership all reasonable politicians and commentators should 
avoid superficial generalities and recognise the need not only 
to safeguard the existing communal lands but to greatly increase 
them as an essential feature of land reform.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Need for Taxes -- An editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 1 June on page 22 begins by noting that President 
Mandela has "stirred a hornet's nest" by speaking of the need to 
raise taxes. The proposal to apply the top tax rate of 43 
percent to income above 80,000 rand is especially controversial 
because it would affect so many people. While supporting the 
"upliftment of South Africa's poor" and the aims of the 
Reconstruction and Development Program, the editorial expresses 
reservations about the tax proposals: "What the Government needs 
to achieve is a measure of income redistribution without 
demotivating or -- worse -- driving out the nation's relatively 
small pool of highly skilled professional and business people. 
The conundrum of how to find more money might possibly be 
solved via the indirect (rather than direct) tax route. The 
Government should consider this as an option." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  KwaZulu State of Emergency -- "The state of emergency in 
KwaZulu/Natal is clearly an impotent measure and should be 
lifted immediately." So argues an editorial in the Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on page 8 on 1 June. It notes that "hundreds 
of people" have died there since the state of emergency was 
declared and goes on to assert: "While rivalry between IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC supporters is a contributing 
factor,...the primary causes of bloodshed can be traced to 
poverty, landlessness and the absence of basic amenities. The 
Reconstruction and Development Programme of the Government is 
aimed at addressing some of these problems and there seems 
little need for an ineffective state of emergency which is 
simply going to hinder the real work required in KwaZulu/Natal." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  New Police Plan Welcomed -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans 
on 30 May in a page-8 editorial says that the new police plan is 
welcome. "Doing away with military culture and tokens of rank 
will go a long way in creating an image of a more friendly 
police force. Such a change of image, and especially from the 
negative perceptions that exist in many parts of the South 
African community, is necessary to ensure that the police force 
plays its rightful role in the new South Africa." The rift 
between the police and the community which it serves has thus 
far disadvantaged the effectiveness of the force. "As a matter 
of urgency, politicians will have to educate communities to 
accept the new police force as their own and show appreciation 
for the work they do under difficult circumstances." 
  Education Problem -- the second editorial in the 30 May 
BEELD 
notes that: "That South Africa is saddled with an enormous 
education problem in the black community is old news. This 
burning problem has been the center of discussion for over a 
decade. Apparently the will to tackle it effectively thus far 
has been lacking." As there has been no joint effort from the 
government, the parent community, teacher and youth 
organizations, discipline has deteriorated so much that in many 
parts of the country a constructive learning athmosphere no 
longer exists. Recently children of a certain school held 
teachers hostage in their classrooms, allegedly after racist 
remarks had been made by a white teacher. "If this is true, 
departmental action should be taken against her," "but such 
undisciplined action by school children should not be condoned. 
It is about time that authorities took a firm stand."

  [Text] The war situation in Cuito is worsening, with the 
number of victims increasing every second. So far, 175 people 
have already been killed. Today, more than 50 people died and 
80 others were wounded. UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] rebels have fired more than 500 shells 
at the city of Cuito since dawn today. The few houses that had 
been left standing during the nine-month war have been flattened 
to the ground. UNITA snipers continue to shoot at everything 
that moves on the streets. The last food stocks at World Food 
Program warehouses have been distributed to the starving 
residents. That means that as of now the situation will be like 
during the nine-month war when people starved to death at just 
about every corner. 
  Meanwhile, movements by Jonas Savimbi's troops have been 
reported in the outlaying areas of the city of Luena, Moxico 
Province, in the past few days. Government forces say UNITA 
will not succeed in its plans. 
  In Lubango, the military situation is not good. UNITA troops 
have stepped up their operations in the Southern Military Front 
since 2 May, particularly in the Front's northeastern strip. 
UNITA raided the capital of Quilengues District. Southern 
Military Front commander General Pereira Furtado told our 
correspondent that the Angolan Armed Forces have not lost any 
positions and the situation is under their control. He said 
government forces have not yet gone on the offensive.

  [Text] The three-week strike by Lesotho police for higher 
salaries ended today after agreement between the government and 
the committee representing the police. 
  A spokesman for the police committee, Lieutenant Phakiso 
Molise, called a press conference this afternoon at the Central 
Police Station in Maseru where he explained that the police had 
decided to return to work in the best interest of the Basotho 
nation. The police had accepted the terms of agreement on 
allowances which have been increased by certain percentages. 
This also applied to members of the prisons service. As far as 
salary increases were concerned, agreement was reached on 
sliding upwards all grades up to the position of major. 
Meanwhile, the strike ended with the police effecting their 
first arrest since the strike started three weeks ago, when they 
arrested a man who masqueraded as a policeman. The man who was 
arrested this afternoon masqueraded as a policeman, wearing 
police uniform and yet he knew that he was not a policeman. He 
in fact works for a security firm in Maseru. 
  He is expected to appear in the Maseru magistrate's court 
shortly, charged with impersonating the police.

  [Text] Colonel Segala, chairman of the Cease-Fire 
Commission [CCF], in Maputo today presented a working plan to 
the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
delegations until the country's pacification process has been 
completed. The plan will be debated at a tripartite meeting 
scheduled for 7 June. 
  At the meeting, Renamo asked for the closure of its assembly 
areas in Timanganine and Chinhanguanine, and the reopening of 
two new assembly areas in Tete and Zambezia Provinces. 
  The government delegation protested against the accusation 
made by the head of the Renamo delegation, that the Mozambican 
Government is said to have abducted a eyewitness connected with 
the alleged training of troops in Nachingwea, Tanzania. The 
government demanded that an investigation be carried out as soon 
as possible to clarify the circumstances surrounding the 
disappearance of the eyewitness.

  [Text] In a meeting in Maputo with cadres of his party, 
Joaquim Chissano, chairman of the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo], has described as positive the fact that the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] is delivering lists of 
areas under its control that must be integrated in the state 
administration. Chissano said, however, that the process should 
advance quickly so that those areas are open to all political 
groups, and for businessmen to operate. He also said the lack of 
freedom of movement in areas under Renamo control, the movement 
of armed men of that organization, and the policy of violence 
against citizens who do not abide by its rules are causing 
concern.

  [Text] Malawi President Bakili Muluzi has already returned 
home from his first visit abroad since his election. He was in 
Maputo for a few hours for talks with Mozambican officials. 
President Chissano described the visit as one of courtesy. 
Journalists who were at the airport to cover the departure of 
the Malawian head of state wanted to know what solution had been 
found to resolve the question of the Malawi Young Pioneers 
[MYP]. President Chissano said: 
  [Begin recording] [Chissano] Our plan is to avoid any 
friction that could lead to a violent or armed dispute, 
regardless of the reasons that prompted the MYP to come to 
Mozambique. They should rest assured that they may return home 
in peace. The Malawian Government will receive them and give 
them protection. Actually, I do not know whether they have 
started to go back home. In view of the prevailing calm in 
Malawi, it is possible that some of them... [pause] if they left 
their country because they were afraid, it could be that they 
have begun going back home. If there are other reasons, then I 
cannot comment. [end recording] 
  Afonso Dhlakama's Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
says it should take part in discussions about the MYP issue 
because there have been accusations that MYP members are in 
Renamo bases. President Chissano comments: 
  [Begin recording] [Chissano] Obviously, I think there is no 
interest in discussing this issue because if MYP members were at 
Renamo bases, Renamo would not give us proof of that. That is 
not what matters. What matters is that MYP members should 
return home. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you not want to involve 
Renamo in the discussions? 
  [Chissano] Renamo is free to contact the Malawian 
Government. 
If Renamo has no MYP members in its bases, than all the better. 
The information we have say they are there [words indistinct] 
so, it is not up to us to prove that they are there. All we can 
do is to say that we have information about the MYP. What 
matters for us is that MYP members return home. Their country is 
willing to receive them. So, if Renamo has no MYP members, we 
have no problems with that. If Renamo has them, then it should 
help us to remove them. [end recording] 
  President Chissano said a number of Renamo members have been 
involved with the MYP. He did not rule out Renamo's 
responsibility over the issue. This is a controversial issue 
about which President Muluzi only said that officially he had no 
knowledge of the situation. Will the issue be ever known fully? 
  Today's talks also dealt with bilateral cooperation. 
  [Begin Chissano recording] We noted that it was necessary to 
activate the cooperation and security commissions. The security 
commission now has a different role to play because both sides 
no longer suspect one another. The idea is to create peace in 
the two countries and to contribute to peace in the region. The 
commission will meet not only to discuss the MYP issue, but also 
peace in general. The cooperation commission will discuss trade 
along the border area to make it a formal activity, serving the 
two sides. I have suggested that efforts should be made to 
complete the last 73 km of the Nacala railroad by raising 
financial assistance. The cooperation commission will discuss 
other issues. [end recording] 
  There are prospects of good cooperation between the two 
countries. President Chissano noted that past problems were 
with the previous government and not with the people of Malawi.

  [Text] In Guinea, a member of the National Electoral 
Commission [CEN], the Alliance for National Renewal [ARENA], has 
withdrawn from the commission. ARENA's leader, Dr. Sekou 
Koressi Conde, told our correspondent Ben Daouda Sylla in 
Conakry the reasons for this decision: 
  [Begin Conde recording] Indeed, we do not accept the fact 
that the CEN is an appendage of the Interior Ministry because 
that is unconstitutional. Second, we believe that we have some 
obligations toward the people who support our political action. 
As far as we are concerned, we have an obligation of loyalty 
toward them which does not allow us to participate in any 
tricks. We have requested the setting up of a constitutional 
council and a state council. We accept the fact that the 
Supreme Court should be the highest body but we also say that we 
want the setting up of a constitutional council, even if it has 
consultative functions. The CEN's present composition is 
outdated, therefore, the ARENA is withdrawing from it. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The national chairman of ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia], Alhaji Koromah, has ordered 
the release of the five ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] soldiers of the 
Nigerian contingent. The ULIMO chairman issued a release order 
yesterday to his field commander, General (Mohamed Dumbula), 
following discussion on the situation between him and ECOMOG 
Field Commander John Inienger and his deputy, Colonel Kasala 
Camara. 
  A ULIMO press release issued last night says Gen. Koromah 
said that the decision to release the five ECOMOG soldiers was 
based on appreciation for Nigeria's sacrificial role in 
resolving the Liberian conflict. He said the ULIMO High 
Military Council of which he is the chairman endorsed the 
decision in a spirit of furthering the speedy implementation of 
the Liberian peace process under the Cotonou Accord.

  [Text] ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] leader, Alhaji Koromah, says the dissolution of 
Liberia's warring factions by the Liberian State Council is 
illegal. Mr. Koromah told newsmen in Monrovia that the Cotonou 
Peace Accord provides for the dissolution of the NPRA [National 
Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] Government and the Interim 
Governrment of National Unity, and not the factions to the 
Liberian conflict. He said the Council of State is a creation 
of the warring factions, and its chairman cannot take unilateral 
decision to dissolve the factions. The ULIMO leader called on 
the State Council to reverse its decision on the dissolution of 
the warring factions. 
  State Council chairman, David Kpomakpor, recently announced 
the dissolution of the warring factions.

  [Text] President Charles Gankay Taylor, in a detailed 
press statement this afternoon, is calling on the Liberian 
Council of State to abide by the Cotonou Accord in its entirety 
if the process of disarmament is to proceed unimpeded, leading 
to a peaceful, democratic, free, and fair election. We have 
Aaron Cally with the detailed story: 
  [Cally] The statement signed by President Taylor outlining 
the position of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
regarding the current peace process, reads thus: 
  We are very disturbed by the artificial barriers that have 
been erected to delay the seating of the entire Liberian 
National Transitional Government, the LNTG, including autonomous 
agencies and public corporations. Even more disturbing is the 
apparent prevailing attitude of relegating the Cotonou Accord, 
by those who derive their authority from them, in pursuit of a 
fruitless exercise and usurpation of powers not delegated to 
them. Lest we forget, the Council of State is only a part of 
the LNTG. It is a creation arising out of the Cotonou Accord, 
signed by the NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly 
Government], NPFL, ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia], and IGNU [Interim Government National 
Unity] on 25 July, 1993 in Cotonou, Benin, and was sworn into 
office on 7 March, 1994. The LNTG is only a transitional 
government, with a very short and definite life span. 
  The press statement continued: The present tragedy we are 
experiencing was primarily caused by the failure to respect the 
rule of law, or the fundamental law of the land -- or just basic 
ground rules. We had hoped that our people would have learned a 
valuable lesson by now, and change their attitude accordingly. 
Instead, we see a disheartening compulsion by the creature to 
violate the laws that created it. 
  For example, the following have been observed since the 
Council of State was seated, the statement continued: 
  1. The council's first public pronouncement stated, among 
other things, that as of 7 March, 1994, the NPFL and ULIMO are 
dissolved, and have been referred to as erstwhile, former, et 
cetera. 
  2. The Council of State's attempt to frustrate the full 
implementation of the allocation of ministries, public 
corporations, and autonomous agencies, as spelled out in the 
allocation of Cotonou III, defies common sense. This had not 
only violated the Cotonou Accord, but effectively delayed the 
progress of the peace process. 
  3. The chairman of the Council of State has begun to behave, 
and usurp, the powers of the president of the Republic of 
Liberia, thereby attempting to marginalize the other members of 
the council. This is also in violation of the Cotonou Accord. 
  4. The Council of State had assumed appointed powers which 
are reserved by and for the parties to the Cotonou Accord. 
  The press statement continued: Now therefore, it has become 
necessary to indicate that the Council of State must abide by 
the Cotonou Accord in its entirety, if the process of 
disarmament is to proceed unimpeded, leading to peaceful, 
democratic, free, and fair elections. The statement, signed by 
President Taylor, also stated the following: 
  1. The Council of State must correct the erroneous 
statements 
about the dissolution of ULIMO and the NPFL; 
  2. The Council of State must be allowed to function in 
accordance with the Cotonou Accord. The council is a collective 
presidency, and therefore its five members are co-equals. The 
chairman is not president of the Republic of Liberia, therefore, 
all privileges accorded the chairman must be equally accorded to 
the other members of the council. 
  The press statement continued: The allocations for public 
corporations and autonomous agencies must be allowed to go 
through, in fulfillment of Cotonou III. The Council of State 
must not allow itself to be manipulated by individual interests, 
at the expense of bringing peace to all people and the nation. 
  The statement concluded: Since the LNTG has a life span of 
six months, these blatant violations of the Cotonou Accord must 
remedied immediately. Failure to do so will coerce us to review 
the entire process, with a view to taking the appropriate 
corrective actions, in order to sustain and maintain the peace, 
bring about disarmament, and create the necessary conditions of 
free and fair elections, the statement concluded.

  [Text] The Council of State of the LNTG [Liberia National 
Transitional Government] has called on the warring factions to 
immediately cease all hostilities and in all the country and 
dismantle all positions formerly held by them. 
  In a radio broadcast, the chairman of the council, His 
Excellency David Kpomakpor, called for the immediate encampment 
of all fighters for the subsequent disarmament by ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group]. The council says it finds it difficult to understand 
that while discussions about deployment of ECOMOG and 
disarmament are under way, some people are still fighting for 
territorial control. He called on Alhaji Koromah, Mr. Roosevelt 
Johnson, Dr. (George Buley), Mr. Charles Taylor, and others to 
stop the hostilities and urge their fighters to disarm. The 
council called on ECOMOG to begin effective deployment 
throughout the country and to take control of all entry points 
into the country and disarm all fighters according to the 
mandate given them by the Cotonou Accord.

visit. This was the first visit abroad by the head of the

stock of his visit, that the behavior of the Malian community in 
Gabon honors us. However, he added, the emigration of Malians 
to that country poses a number of problems; there is a need to 
reconsider our emigration policy.

  [Excerpt] National Assembly proceedings resumed this 
morning. Here is our reporter Saibou Yara Nyandou with a live 
report. 
  [Nyandou] Indeed, they all turned up this morning and 
exchanged accolades with their colleagues of the majority. They 
have returned to the parliamentary family. By they, I mean: 
Hama Amadou, Afara Djika, Moutari Moussa, Ila Kane, Amadou 
Boukari, and others among the 33 parliamentary opposition 
members. A little over two and a half months ago, during the 
roll call, our eyes turned to their empty seats. However, since 
28 May, following the announcement of their return, we have had 
the certainty that they will stay, work, and participate in the 
present and future sessions for the triumph of democracy and the 
consolidation of the gains made so far. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Nigeria Police has warned that any political 
program outside those by the Federal Government should be 
considered illegal and, therefore, will not be tolerated. In a 
statement in Lagos, the police drew attention to the activities 
of a group known as the National Democratic Coalition, whose 
action and utterances it said were not only illegal but 
confrontational and designed to undermine the security of the 
government. It pointed out that the government, in its genuine 
efforts to turn the country to democratic rule, had set in 
motion a program to achieve the goal. The police advised all 
genuine advocates of democracy to take advantage of the ongoing 
processes for a constitutional conference.

  [Text] The elections for a national constitutional 
conference, organized by the military government, ended on 
schedule over the weekend, in spite of a boycott in some parts 
of the country. Well, the boycott was called by the NADECO, the 
National Democratic Coalition. NADECO say they want a sovereign 
national conference, whose decisions would be final, instead of 
this one, which they fear may not have any significant powers. 
The government says that the conference will start its work on 
27 June on schedule, but NADECO says that, in spite of that, its 
boycott will continue. Well, the former governor of Ogun State, 
Chief Segun Osoba, is a leading member of NADECO. Sola Odunfa 
met him and asked him what they are going to do now: 
  [Begin recording] [Osoba] We intend to start series of 
legitimate actions, legitimate actions -- I want to repeat -- to 
ensure that we get our rights. 
  [Odunfa] The military government has all instruments of 
coercion. The first which they can use is to arrest all of you 
and dump you in detention. Are you prepared for that? 
  [Osoba] I have told my family that as soon as they do not 
hear from me, they should know that I have been arrested. We 
are all ready, in fact fully mobilized, to be detained, and we 
are fully ready for whatever action the government may want to 
take. 
  [Odunfa] Is this action not belated? Why did you not take 
this action when the election was annulled last year? 
  [Osoba] At that time, the government created a division 
within the political class, and they were using the leadership 
of the two political parties to cause the confusion, and so 
there was no united front. But when the military came in, we 
thought we could give them a chance -- hoping that they will 
rectify the situation quickly. Up till now, we don't know the 
program of this government, which is unfortunate. A military 
government should come in to do a surgical operation and leave 
immediately. So unfortunately, this government hasn't given us 
any political program of any kind. We don't even know the 
agenda of this conference, nobody knows the rules and 
regulations governing this conference, there is no enabling 
decree governing this conference, so everything is illegal. And 
that is why we are moving, because we now think that we are back 
again to an unending transitional program that we started in 
1985. 
  [Odunfa] Will it therefore be correct to take this, your 
proposed action, as a direct confrontation with the military? 
  [Osoba] I wouldn't call it confrontation with the military, 
because we respect the majority of our compatriots in uniform as 
being patriotic, and not part of the little clique who want to 
cling to power. So, we should separate the military, as a group 
who believe that they must go back to professionalism. That 
movement started under Babangida, and 99 percent of those still 
in uniform are still in support of democratization. But, there 
is a small clique of them who are politicians in uniform, who 
are bent on staying in power -- a continuous change of baton 
from one uniformed military head of state to another one. There 
is that small cabal that we are facing, not the entire military.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] A regional summit meeting has been called for next 
Monday [6 June] to discuss the crisis in Rwanda. It's being 
convened by Kenya's head of state, President Daniel arap Moi, 
and he has invited his counterparts from Tanzania, Uganda, and 
Zaire, countries which have all been directly affected by the 
mass exodus of refugees from Rwanda. On the line to Nairobi, 
Heather Saleh asked President Moi what he hoped the meeting 
would achieve: 
  [Begin recording] [Moi] Every sensible person within East 
Africa knows that life is precious, and therefore this meeting, 
which will take place on Monday [6 June] will enable the leaders 
of East Africa -- Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zaire -- to discuss 
how to go about the present situation in Rwanda, and to ask 
Rwandese leaders from RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] or those 
within the government not to add anguish and suffering to the 
people of Rwanda and then... [pauses] so that we can discuss and 
see how to restore peace in that country. I won't tell you in 
what form -- whether to take some troops to Rwanda or some other 
ways to alleviate problems and suffering of the Rwandese people. 
  [Saleh] But you speak about the possibility of taking troops 
to Rwanda, so would Kenya be ready to contribute men to the 
peacekeeping force? 
  [Moi] It will depend on the decision of the leaders on 
Monday. 
  [Saleh] So, you are not excluding the possibility of 
contributing troops? 
  [Moi] No, I am not excluding it. We will discuss all 
aspects that will bring the Rwandese situation back to 
normality, and to restore confidence of the people of Rwanda. 
  [Saleh] But wouldn't it be more effective to declare 
immediate support for the United Nations efforts, put troops at 
their disposal, and carry on the talks later, because the 
situation is very urgent? 
  [Moi] Well, I can't get the United Nations at the moment to 
move there. I want to seek, well.... [pauses] After Monday's 
meeting, we will then ask everybody, including Western countries 
-- Europe, America, and everybody else -- to play a bigger role 
on the humanitarian side, and then decide also as to who should 
participate in the restoration of peace in that area, in 
collaboration with the leaders of Rwanda in general. 
  [Saleh] Well, some people might say that the East African 
nations' efforts in resolving regional crises do not have a good 
record, and IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development] has been trying to resolve the Sudanese problem, 
but so far it has failed? 
  [Moi] No we don't. The Sudanese problem, Madam, started 40 
years ago, probably before you were born, and a problem of that 
nature cannot be solved within weeks. I'm happy personally I am 
chairman of the subcommittee that was established by IGADD, and 
they have agreed on certain principles and they have made a 
declaration of principles on matters which have been difficult 
to be dealt with before, and both parties have signed another 
document enabling humanitarian groups to move into Sudan and 
decided to suggest corridors of tranquility where humanitarian 
groups can pass. 
  [Saleh] So, you would encourage the Rwandese to stake some 
hopes on your initiative, and you would disagree with people who 
say that all this is just for the prestige of regional leaders? 
  [Moi] No, no no! I'm serious about this. I don't jump on 
things. Have you heard Moi jumping on things? I don't rush on 
things. I'm serious on this one. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good afternoon. The Lusaka talks are still at a 
standstill. A few changes have occurred over the past few hours 
although Alioune Blondin Beye has stepped up his contacts with 
government and National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] representatives. This morning Beye received in 
separate audiences the leaders of the government and UNITA 
negotiating teams. Nothing concrete is known about the outcome 
of the meetings. Sources close to the mediators say the meeting 
discussed issues linked to the resumption of the talks and the 
peace process which have led to the present impasse. 
  It can be concluded that members of the UNITA team are still 
indisposed because of the latest military operations in Angola. 
To confirm this, today's edition of the TIMES OF ZAMBIA 
carries an accusation by UNITA about the operations. Political 
circles in Lusaka noted that those who sow the wind, reap the 
whirlwind. They questioned who has been shelling the city of 
Cuito and other areas in Angola. 
  Meanwhile, [name indistinct], head of the UN Office of 
Public 
Information, arrived in Lusaka today on a two-day visit. He 
will assess what progress has been made at the talks, and then 
will go to Luanda to meet Angolan officials. 
  This morning, the government and UNITA negotiating teams 
held 
separate meetings to discuss their own strategies. It is likely 
that the negotiators will return to the negotiating table at any 
moment in view of the urgent need for peace in Angola.

Commission [CCF] in Maputo today issued a protest against the 
memorandum submitted by CCF chairman Colonel Segala to the 
Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] regarding the 
discrepancy in the number of government soldiers. The 
government delegation says the memorandum is biased and does not 
reflect the truth. The delegation regrets Col. Segala's not so 
dignified attitude, in referring to the CSC matters that had not 
been finalized by the CCF. The government protest notes that 
under no circumstances can Col. Segala replace the sides, let 
alone the CCF. The protest adds that the peace accord does not 
provide for unilateral (?decisions) by the CCF chairman unless 
he has at least secured the consensus of the sides.

  [Text] Abidjan, 30 May (AIP/PANA) -- The general secretary 
of the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI) has confirmed 
that foreigners will be allowed to vote in the country's 1995 
presidential elections. The PDCI will not withdraw the right to 
vote of "people who, since 1945, have been voting in Cote 
d'Ivoire", said Laurent Dona Fologo at a rally in support of 
President Henri Konan Bedie, who came to power after the death 
of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny on 7 December in 
Yamoussoukro, central Cote d'Ivoire. 
  The rally was organized at the weekend in Bassam (43 km east 
of Abidjan). "There is no question about that. It must be clear 
to everybody," added Fologo, minister of state in charge of 
national integration in the first post-Houphouet government. 
"[Word indistinct] and clear that those who are qualified to 
vote must vote," the PDCI general secretary concluded. 
  The PDCI has the majority in the Ivorian parliament.

  [Text] The authorities in Mali seem determined to follow up 
the peace agreement signed earlier this month with the northern 
Tuareg rebels by taking tough action to clamp down on the 
continued insecurity in the region. The agreement, signed in 
Algiers between the Malian Government and the Tuareg Azaouad 
movement, called for the dismantling of rebel military bases and 
allowed for the integration of former Tuareg rebels into the 
Malian Army and civil service. But the armed attacks, often 
blamed on bandits, have continued, and now President Alpha 
Konare has ordered a security crackdown as Mustapha Sana reports 
in this telex from Bamako: 
  Speaking to representatives of political parties, trade 
unions, and associations at a meeting at the presidential 
palace, the head of state said he gave orders to restrict the 
entry and circulation of weapons in the country. President 
Konare said that measures will be taken with the cooperation of 
neighboring countries to stem the traffic in arms across the 
borders of Mali. 
  The president also spoke of the northern movement, (Ganda 
Koi), which opposes the agreement with the Tuaregs, and which 
recently made an appeal to Malians to fight the Tuaregs. He 
said he understood the exasperation of the sedentary northern 
population from which (Ganda Koi) draws its support but he 
stressed that he refused any management of the peace accord on 
an ethnic basis. Speaking of insecurity in the north, President 
Konare said it was a difficult situation but not a desperate 
one. He said he would not tolerate the continuation of that 
state of affairs because it prevented the presence of the civil 
service in northern Mali and has also impeded development 
activities.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Pascal Lissouba by correspondent </F>
Francis Kpatinde in Brazzaville; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kpatinde] For the first time 
in its history, the CFA franc has been devalued in relation to 
the French franc. 
  [Lissouba] I saw the blow coming. I instructed my close 
associates to go to the IMF and the World Bank and convince them 
how tragic the decision would be if unaccompanied by serious 
measures, by a sort of Marshall Plan in order to cushion, even 
annul, its bad effects. 
  [Kpatinde] Africa is marginalized we increasingly hear. 
  [Lissouba] It is not marginalized, it is ignored. It does 
not exist. We noticed this during the GATT negotiations. We 
realized it recently again with the devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  [Kpatinde] Who is to blame? 
  [Lissouba] It is difficult to lay blame. Although I am an 
African, I do not systematically attribute the mistakes to 
others. Why accuse others if we always kowtow to others and if 
we prefer to dance to imported music? The day Africans say: 
"Certainly, each of us has a fatherland, but our future depends 
on a coherent, rigorous, and integrated Africa, a thoughtful 
Africa," they will find the solution to their problems. For 
instance, there was an average of 10 deaths each day in Angola 
before independence. Today this figure is multiplied by 100. 
Who is to blame? Are those who tell the different factions: 
"Take up arms and fight," or are the Angolans themselves to 
blame? 
  Congolese wanted democracy fervently. Why have some chosen 
today to hide from the reality rather than help in consolidating 
the freedom we won at such a high price? 
  [Kpatinde] The devaluation of the CFA franc was expected for 
two or three years yet the Dakar decision seemed to surprise 
most of your peers. 
  [Lissouba] Two or three years? You are lenient: We were 
expecting it for at least 10 years, but the relative growth and 
our riches -- such as oil in Congo -- and artifice enabled us to 
dodge the debate for a long time. The economic crisis has 
brought us down to earth. The system on which the CFA franc was 
based began to crumble. Africa is no longer as attractive as 
before. Its indebtedness has assumed proportions that weighed 
on the common foundation. The French themselves have too many 
problems to continue keeping our coffers afloat. 
  [Kpatinde] Since devaluation was inevitable the heads of 
state should have worked out counter measures. 
  [Lissouba] The continuity of the state has obliged me to 
assume the mistakes of those who preceded me. What could we 
have done? To act would have required the help of the OAU or 
much more solid and interdependent regional institutions. The 
financial crisis in which these institutions are struggling does 
not enable us to reflect on such fundamental issues as 
devaluation and creation of a new currency. 
  [Kpatinde] The creation of such a currency, by the way, has 
been planned. 
  [Lissouba] Look at the disaster around us. We have resisted 
better only because we remained within the franc zone. Despite 
all its shortcomings, the CFA franc remains a stable currency 
that feeds a parallel sector and does not cause much inflation. 
The CFA franc has not basically destabilized our economies as 
in the case of the cedi (Ghana), the naira (Nigeria), or the 
zaire today. We could have obtained better results in our zone 
but because of political instability we have not concentrated on 
the main thing these past decades. Power went from one hand to 
the other. Today, it is Peter, the next day it is Paul. How 
can we think about long-term development under these conditions? 
  [Kpatinde] Are you for or against the devaluation? 
  [Lissouba] You do not need to put the question that way. 
When it rains, you do not ask yourself whether or not you like 
the downpour. The devaluation could not be avoided and it has 
simply come into effect. 
  [Kpatinde] What must be done to offset its negative effects? 
  [Lissouba] If one could afford to dream, and if our partners 
really wanted to help us, I should say that indeed a real 
Marshall Plan needed to be put in place for Africa. In any 
case, backup measures are necessary in at least two areas: 
foreign debt obligations and equipment costs. All our debts 
must be canceled because we are not responsible for them and 
very often they are based on shady contracts. No doubt it will 
never be known precisely what has been done with all these loans 
which we have seemingly contracted. Equipment costs vital to 
our industrialization should not be prohibitive. Otherwise, a 
bowl of rice will become a luxury for the less privileged among 
us. [passage omitted] 
  [Kpatinde] French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin 
recently had the occasion to appreciate your leadership 
qualities... 
  [Lissouba] "Alliance with a more powerful person than 
yourself has some disadvantage" and according to La Fontaine 
"might is always right." The fact that a minister from a 
superpower country considers that he has more rights than the 
president of a small republic clearly illustrates the fight 
between the iron pot and the earthenware. If you want to be 
respected you must first start by respecting others. Shady 
deals are not rare in France either and the CANARD ENCHAINE [a 
French newspaper] is quite generous about revealing them... 
  [Kpatinde] What is the point of disagreement between you and 
the French Government? 
  [Lissouba] Believe me, I am most surprised about France's 
hostility to me. I went to France for the first time at age 14 
and stayed there till I was 32 and I think I have adopted the 
culture of that country. I am a man with a unique personality 
and cannot be a mere replica of the French. However, I am far 
from nourishing the idea of threatening French interests in 
Congo because it is France which inspired me spiritually. We 
are able to subsist today, thanks to the resources we draw from 
oil which we are incapable of tapping from the ocean bottom 
apparently by using our own intelligence. I am not ashamed to 
say that it is France's creative genius that provides for our 
livelihood today. I deplore this to some degree but it is a 
reality which I admit. 
  [Kpatinde] Maybe people wanted to test how much you love 
France? 
  [Lissouba] I had to make pledges and give guarantees. I had 
to prove that I will not attack in any way the interests of 
those helping us. 
  [Kpatinde] The law which concedes to Elf company the 
marketing of all the crude oil from the Nkossa deposit is among 
these pledges.... 
  [Lissouba] This law was initiated by me and it was passed 
last December. My message was devoid of any ambiguity: "We 
guarantee you your interests, guarantee us peace and safe life!" 
Not my own life, but those of my people and of all the innocent 
persons who die needlessly every day. 
  [Kpatinde] What is the exact nature of the concessions made 
to Elf? 
  [Lissouba] The term "concessions" is not appropriate. Under 
the agreements signed with the companies operating in Congo, a 
quota of the oil production should go to us, and this should be 
payable in cash or in kind. To receive payment in kind, we just 
need to inform our partners at least six months before hand. As 
a good Cartesian, I thought by notifying our partners three 
years before hand I was within the stipulated time. I made the 
decision to give a notice of three years in advance and to sell 
by anticipation to another company, namely Oxy, the quota that 
should normally go to Congo out of the Nkossa deposit. That is 
all. Our French partners reacted for reasons which one can 
easily understand: "Why should you give your quota to other 
people apart from us? After all, Oxy could prospect for oil as 
we do." That is sheer logic. In the face of these reserves, we 
asked Oxy to prospect for oil instead of buying oil already 
prospected and exploited by others. 
  [Kpatinde] Are you condemning the agreement signed in April 
1993 with Oxy? 
  [Lissouba] Let us say that the wording of the contract is 
now 
slightly different. With a permit, Oxy can now operate 
peacefully. A quota of the oil explored will go that company; 
the remainder will be for us. Although the former permits 
granted are maintained, in the future the rule to determine an 
equitable sharing of the production quota will be strictly 
adhered to. 
  [Kpatinde] So, Oxy will no longer use -- as initially agreed 
to -- Congo's quota of Brent oil from the Nkossa deposit? 
  [Lissouba] Exactly. The law passed in December extending 
Elf's high sea exploration has put an end to that eventuality. 
I will not sell Nkossa oil to Oxy. At the beginning, I thought 
it would be simple, but the logic our French partners was 
another matter. Let me say that we could have settled this 
matter in a more amicable way. 
  [Kpatinde] According to LETTRE DU SUD, a confidential 
bulletin published in Paris, you granted Oxy all Congo's oil 
quotas.... 
  [Lissouba] These are allegations. When I was elected in 
August 1992, Elf and Agip were controlling 90 percent of our oil 
production. We are currently drafting a law on hydrocarbons 
that will us to double or even triple the number of our partners 
in a few years. 
  Why would we give all our assets to one partner at a time we 
are trying to find more partners? 
  [Kpatinde] Who will your future partners be? 
  [Lissouba] We are currently negotiating with Shell. Oxy will 
intervene on Marine XI and Marine XII, and will fill in the 
vacancy left by Amoco which wishes to withdraw. I repeat that 
Oxy will operate on the sites with its own means and not buy oil 
exploited by others. Total and other smaller companies are also 
competing. 
  [Kpatinde] Why was the law by which you granted Elf 
exclusive 
rights to the commercialization of the Nkossa Brent oil voted on 
twice by Parliament? 
  [Lissouba] There were some minor problems in the dealing 
between the Presidency and the ministries concerned. Those in 
charge had forgotten to include the amendments I made in the 
first draft. These omissions were amended and the law was voted 
on in emergency session as stipulated in the Constitution. It 
was nothing very serious in fact, as it was just to replace the 
word "sold" by "commercialized." 
  [Kpatinde] So, you signed a peace of the brave with Elf? 
  [Lissouba] If you want to call it that, only we were not at 
war, at least as far as I am concerned. I maintained right from 
the beginning that in no way were Elf's interests threatened. 
What else should we do if not manage our own interests while 
taking into account the interests of others, and ask for the 
royalties needed to modernize our country? 
  Our discussions with Elf are going on and we will come to an 
agreement.... 
  [Kpatinde] Not so long ago, there were rumors of a coup 
d'etat in Brazzaville.... 
  [Lissouba] I came to power not in a coup d'etat but in line 
with a procedure set up and agreed upon by all Congolese, 
including the military, who pledged to abide by the democratic 
institutions: free, contested, and transparent elections. I 
have no fear of any coup. 
  [Kpatinde] Who was plotting against you? 
  [Lissouba] The practice of coup d'etat is a bad habit 
inherited from the past. In democracy, power is not conquered 
with guns; it belongs to the National Assembly elected at the 
polls. So let us allow those nostalgic for the past to adjust 
to the new era. One day, they will finally leave their guns in 
the closet. [passage omitted] 
  [Kpatinde] How do you explain the violence that is currently 
rampant in Brazzaville? 
  [Lissouba] First of all, it is due to acculturation. When 
you teach people that power lies in the use of force, what do 
you expect from them except to take up arms and attack the 
Presidency instead of waiting for the next election? 
  [Kpatinde] Will the current lull in violence last in 
Brazzaville? 
  [Lissouba] Like all human actions, this lull cannot be 
separated from the general situation that has prevailed in Congo 
for a year now. What do we see? The domination of individual 
interests over the general interest and the stubbornness of 
those who are determined to take power at all costs, even 
bloodshed, thus endangering this lull. We will come out of it 
with a spiritual awakening and we will return to our old values 
if we reinforce the security of our people. We have to 
reinforce security in all ways, especially by offering 
development to our people and improving their prospects. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kpatinde] What do you think is behind this sudden lull? 
  [Lissouba] Certain facts became clear to the people. For a 
start, the people were losing out in the fratricidal clashes, 
which led to loss of life and property. The cause of the 
disturbances is unclear. Some people, like the former head of 
state, say they were due to the lack of security following the 3 
November shooting, which led to three deaths. This shooting, 
however, took place at a time when the single party system was 
in charge of all security. The government set up in September 
1992 was overthrown less than two months later following a vote 
of no confidence. It did not, therefore, have the time to 
examine any documents, much less even provide the least amount 
of security. Statements by former leaders made the whole 
country consider what was going on and understand that all 
violence was part of the thinking that "the one who has the gun 
wields the power," an idea which is very dear to Marxists. 
  [Kpatinde] Will you maintain your policy of holding out a 
hand to the opposition now that you have won a clear election 
victory, which has been confirmed by an international 
arbitration body? 
  [Lissouba] I did not wait for the arbitrations body's 
verdict 
before making statements that would rally the people round. In 
any case, the true question is what price Congo is prepared to 
pay to consolidate peace. 
  [Kpatinde] People accuse you of selecting all your aides 
from 
Nibolek, your native region.... 
  [Lissouba] At the Science Faculty in Brazzaville, I taught 
hundreds of students without considering their regional or 
ethnic origin. Why would I change my attitude now? That is an 
unfair accusation. Most of those students are currently 
unemployed and are waiting to be trained to continue the job. I 
hope to create a pan- African institute of innovation management 
for them in Pointe-Noire. Whoever wants to obtain a position of 
authority should go to the institute to be trained in 
decentralization, management, communication... 
  [Kpatinde] It has, however, been observed that all your 
aides 
are from the same region. 
  [Lissouba] Because of the crisis, which has been going on 
for 
two years, it is difficult to find the best aides. At first, I 
recruited professionals from my opponents' group, but their only 
distinguishing characteristic was their vanity. Upon 
reflection, I told myself that they were of no use to me and 
were likely to cause more problems. [passage omitted] 
  [Kpatinde] You spoke of a "political initiative" recently. 
Do you intend to involve your leading opponent, Bernard 
Kolelas, in government? 
  [Lissouba] When I returned to Congo after several years in 
exile, I went to see my brother Kolelas at his home in Bacongo 
to make political suggestions. Even though I am the older one, 
I took the initiative to visit him at home. So far, he has not 
given me any response but the current disorder. There are no 
suggestions I can make he does not know of already. 
  [Kpatinde] So, Kolelas will not be your next prime minister. 
  [Lissouba] I could not do that even if I wanted to. The 
Constitution stipulates that the prime minister must be chosen 
from the parliamentary majority at the National Assembly. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kpatinde] One might have thought he would be minister of 
state in a national unity government. 
  [Lissouba] A government of national unity is not a 
government 
of political parties. During the formation of the first 
government, I invited to Brazzaville some professionals close to 
the opposition whose contribution I wanted. After consulting 
their leadership, they declined my offer. 
  [Kpatinde] Would you rather have Kolelas heading the 
Brazzaville City Council? 
  [Lissouba] He does not need me. All I have been doing is to 
encourage him to take the City Council. His party has the 
largest number of municipal councillors in the capital. For 
Brazzaville, one is talking of 700,000 inhabitants, that is a 
third of the population of Congo. Well, Kolelas must show his 
ability to lead a third of Congo! He could set up a municipal 
police force to protect all Brazzaville residents, without 
exception. Brazzaville, as a cosmopolitan capital, must not be 
the hostage of one ethnic group. 
  [Kpatinde] There is talk of two moderate opposition figures, 
Jean-Pierre Thystere Tchicaya and Justin Lekoundzou, entering 
the government. 
  [Lissouba] I know the former, who is my junior, better than 
the latter. Both are very capable, but in politics, ulterior 
motives are never far off. 
  [Kpatinde] In mid-November, you expelled the Radio France 
Internationale (RFI) correspondent.... 
  [Lissouba] This lady was often mistaken about Congo. I 
believe that my country, no matter how poor it is, has to 
preserve its honor. To be an RFI journalist does not mean that 
one is above everything, that one can drag our name in the mud 
with impunity. We have too much respect for our ancestors and 
our culture to close our eyes to that. 
  [Kpatinde] What exactly do you accuse her of? 
  [Lissouba] I shall limit myself to two examples: She said on 
the air that there was a curfew in Brazzaville; this was false. 
She also said that the airport was closed to traffic; this too 
was false. 
  When her misconduct came to my attention, I asked the 
interior minister and his foreign affairs counterpart to meet 
her and ask her to be more objective. We were not asking her to 
take our side, just to stop fabricating stories. She concluded 
from this that she was the brightest star in the heavens. 
  [Kpatinde] Where do your relations with Israel stand? Are 
they limited to security matters? Did you really conclude a 
"multimillion dollar" contract with the Israelis? 
  [Lissouba] Congo restored its ties with Israel in 1991, 
through a resolution of the National Conference. We operated in 
line with existing accords. We are faced with a savage urban 
guerrilla force and we were defenseless against the atrocities 
they committed before, which could start again at any time. 
  Congo, it should be pointed out, has 14,000 soldiers and 
security personnel, of whom only 4,000 are enlisted men. It 
does not have any units specially trained to combat urban 
guerrillas. This shortcoming prompted us, when faced with the 
violence prevailing in our country for more than a year now, to 
put in place within the shortest possible time a specialized 
unit by using the know-how of other countries, particularly 
Israel. Such know-how must be paid for. This is the cost of 
our security. The most important thing is not the cost, but the 
expected efficiency. We are prepared to pay the necessary price 
for it.

  [Text] Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie is planning to 
create a new CFA franc like de Gaulle did in 1959 when he 
created the new French franc. The new CFA franc will equal 100 
current CFA francs and, since it will have the same value as the 
French franc, a single currency will circulate within the franc 
zone. It will be a simple solution. The move will clearly show 
that the CFA franc, even if devalued, remains resolutely 
attached to the French franc. Also it will show that the January 
devaluation is definitely the last one. 
  The objective is to prevent any further devaluation of the 
CFA down the line and give additional support to the operation 
launched at the beginning of the year.

<F P=106> [Article by Alima Fall: "Why Bedie Is Tightening the Screws"] </F>
  [Excerpts] After the "post-Houphouet" period, Cote 
d'Ivoire seems to be entering the Bedie era. From late April to 
early May, the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI], which 
the late head of state led for nearly half a century, will hold 
an extraordinary congress to elect a new leader. The natural 
candidate to lead the ruling party is the new president, Henri 
Konan Bedie. This is first and foremost, it seems, an act of 
union. In reality, the PDCI, which had so far been able to 
contain its divisions, is showing them today in broad daylight. 
  For the first time there is a strong protest movement within 
the ruling party, which has come out into the open. Djeny 
Kobina's Rally of Republicans [RDR] openly defies the 
leadership, particularly its secretary general, Laurent 
Dona-Fologo, the minister of state in charge of national 
integration, one of the new government's strongmen. 
  Kobina and his friends do not want a head of state who is a 
party leader. They have their champion: Philippe Gregoire 
Yace, president of the Economic and Social Council. This man 
led the PDCI for several years and knows all its intricacies. 
If you know the relationship between Bedie and the president of 
the Economic and Social Council, this proposal might make you 
smile. In fact, the RDR pronounced itself especially in favor 
of a break with what it calls "a republic of injustices." It 
calls for the strict and clear management of public affairs, 
which should not be made any more difficult through the 
concentration of too much power. 
  It does not want a return to the former practices of the old 
times of the Ivorian miracle. The era of cheap money is over. 
It has been replaced by a devaluation, which was preceded by 
economic difficulties which had already forced the government to 
be more realistic. 
  Bedie is aware of the fact that he must hurry. He only has 
18 months until the October 1995 presidential election, 18 
months to move from the legality obtained by virtue of Article 
11 to the legitimacy that obtained from the polls. [passage 
omitted] 
  As an administrator Bedie must make the country move, but as 
a politician he has to win the election, which will be held 
within 18 months. In this field the new president and his team 
have left no stone unturned in occupying all the pillars of 
power, beginning with the media. Those which depend on the 
state have already put on new feathers. Ali Coulibaly and 
Yacouba Kebe have been relieved of their posts -- Coulibaly from 
Channel I of the National Television Network and Kebe from the 
FRATERNITE MATIN newspaper chain. The opposition press has not 
been spared either. Many of its more renowned writers are 
currently in prison. State television has regained the glorious 
moments it enjoyed under the one-party system. [passage omitted] 
  The PDCI's extraordinary congress has given the president 
the 
opportunity to draw up "his friends" into the ranks. He does 
not want to lose sight of the party. He must, by any means, 
control it. This is one of his major war machines for the 
forthcoming election. In Bedie's entourage, it is commonly 
explained that: 
  "We have a new president. We need to make him known and 
loved by the people. We are not going to give out power as a 
gift to those who are fighting us. Our opponents must fight 
legitimately to win. The congress is a good platform. It will 
be open and democratic. [passage omitted] 
  The old political organization which he inherited is full of 
currents and divisions, whose origin is not just limited to the 
Bedie-Ouattara rivalry. Long before the violent demonstrations 
in March and April of 1990, and before the appointment of 
Alassane Ouattara as prime minister, the PDCI was already 
showing signs of internal strife. [passage omitted] 
  It is up to the congressional delegates -- some 3,000 of 
them 
-- to play firemen, in order to enable Bedie to get a firm grip 
on the party and to use it as a weapon, especially against any 
eventual Gbagbo-Yace-Ouattara alliance, which some Ivorians are 
anxiously hoping for.

  [Text] Lagos, 24 May (NAN) -- The Federal Government has 
not began withdrawing Nigerian troops currently serving in the 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] peace keeping operations in Liberia, the 
director of defence information, Brig.-Gen. Fred Chijuka, [words 
indistinct]. 
  Chijuka [words indistinct] while chatting with newsmen 
explained that the government had, however, decided that no 
additional troops would be deployed to Liberia. He further 
explained that the plan and feeling among the military 
authorities was that the country should start reducing its 
troops in Liberia, as soon as other African countries expected 
to contribute troops had done so. The withdrawal of the troops, 
Brig.-Gen. Chijuka said, would effectively commence when troops 
from the expected countries had taken over some of the areas 
currently manned by Nigerian troops. 
  The defence spokesman noted that the situation in Liberia 
was 
gradually improving as no faction was currently fighting with 
the peace keeping force. He, however, said that heavy equipment 
requiring maintenance after use in the ECOMOG operations was 
being returned to Nigeria. It will be recalled that Nigerian 
troops had been serving in the peace keeping force since 1990 
when the operation commenced.

  [Text] Abuja, 27 April (NAN) -- The federal government 
today banned forthwith any pre-constitutional conference 
meetings to allow for the unfettered election of delegates who 
would participate at the actual conference. 
  Inaugurating the 16-man election committee for the 
constitutional conference in Abuja, the head of state, Gen. Sani 
Abacha said that the government allowed previous meetings so as 
to give ample opportunity for ideas to evolve and memoranda 
produced at such to be forwarded to the national constitutional 
conference commission for collation. Though he announced that 
all political meetings were still banned, Gen. Abacha said that 
individuals could canvass to be elected as independent 
candidates in their various conference- district constituencies. 
No one should be left in doubt as to our commitment and 
determination to find an acceptable and lasting solution to the 
problems that have bedeviled our great country in the past many 
years," Gen. Abacha said. 
  The head of state said that the decision to set up the 
committee was informed by the need to evolve a reliable election 
culture in the country. He urged the committee to ensure that 
the spectrum of elected candidates was broad, independent and 
representative, and that they should be persons who were 
conscious of their responsibility to peace and the progress of 
the nation. Abacha said thet the elecion process must be 
completely above board, leaving no shade of doubts in the minds 
of anybody, adding that stiff penalties must be set to 
discourage the activities of bloc and parochial interests. He 
said the committee must ensure adequate publicity of their 
operations so as to properly educate delegates. 
  The head of state urged the committee to delimit the 
constituencies in conjunction with the states' administrators 
and supervise and conduct the elections with the assistance of 
the states and local governments. He also urged them to 
enunciate the guidelines of the elections which should ensure 
equity, justice and fair play, and screen intending delegates in 
accordance with constitutional provisions to discourage people 
with criminal records from participating in the conference. 
Gen. Abacha said that the committee should take any other 
action that would ensure a smooth and fair election. The 
election is expected to produce 273 members, three from each of 
the 90 senatorial districts and three from Abuja, while 96 will 
be appointed by the government.

  [Text] Lagos, 16 Apr (NAN) -- Nigeria has no territorial 
ambition, the chief of Army staff, Major General Chris Alli has 
declared. Maj. Gen. Alli made the declaration in a lecture 
entitled "Defense Capabilities of the Armed Forces of Nigeria", 
which he delivered to the participants of the senior executive 
course 16 at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic 
Studies (NIPSS), in Kuru, near Jos. He emphasised that Nigeria, 
like most developing countries in Africa, did not, as a matter 
of policy, seek to expand its territory nor acquire new ones. 
Nigeria, he said, did not also, seek to export any ideology 
adding that the Nigerian Armed Forces were meant primarily to 
safeguard the country's territorial integrity. 
  The military forces, he said further, were also to defend 
the 
country from external aggression and provide support for the 
nation's foreign policy. However, he emphasised the need for 
improved defence funding to further boost Nigeria's defence 
capabilities, noting that high morale of troops, availability of 
weapons and their maintenance had positive effect on defence. 
Maj. Gen. Alli said that the preparedness of the nation's 
various services ranged between 30 to 60 per cent and noted that 
a fragile economy can hardly sustain the heavy pressure of war. 
He said that defence capabilities was affected mainly by 
funding, manpower development, morale and state of equipment 
without which a force cannot be credible. An Army statement 
also quoted Maj. Gen. Alli as advocating for a collective 
security system by which Nigeria should seek more alliances and 
security agreements in the West African sub-region.

  [Text] Abuja, 2 Apr (NAN) -- The minister of state for 
foreign affairs, Chief Anthony Ani, has described as "fruitful," 
the outcome of his recent diplomatic mission to five southern 
African countries, where, he briefed the respective leaders on 
the dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi 
Peninsula. 
  Answering questions from newsmen in his office today on the 
outcome of the visit, Chief Ani denied claims that Nigeria 
allowed Cameroon to seize the initiative from her, in embarking 
on extensive diplomatic campaign to win support for its claim 
over the peninsula. He said that Cameroon's claim which is 
hinged on the Anglo-German Treaty of March 11, the only treaty 
which allegedly ceded the peninsula to her, could not stand 
because the said treaty was never ratified by the British 
Parliament. Chief Ani showed newsmen a photocopy of the Hansard 
of the British Parliament of July 1913, which showed that the 
treaty was never ratified, as debate on it was stalled because 
of a protest by the Obong of Calabar who sent a delegation to 
Britain during a debate on the issue. 
  He reminded Cameroon that Nigeria once fought a civil war 
and 
could have no problem raising an army of 1 million men, adding, 
"but we want all forces of destruction to be turned into forces 
the peaceful resolution of the border dispute with our 
Cameroonian bothers." 
  The minister said that Nigeria was ready to co-operate and 
work together with Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon for 
the exploitation of the resources available in the Gulf of 
Guinea. "Let us sit down as brothers and look at all the 
documents available to both sides on the Bakassi issue and on 
the basis of this, determine who actually owns the disputed 
territory," he said, adding if after then we are unable to agree 
we can take the matter to the OAU. Chief Ani said that Nigeria 
was ready to assist France to extricate itself out of the mess 
it (France) has found herself as a result of her direct 
involvement in the dispute on the side of Cameroon. He however 
warned that if France decided to remain intransigent and 
uncooperative, we reserve the right to take whatever step we 
deem fit to protect our interests.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with ANC President Nelson </F>
Mandela by David Beresford in Johannesburg; date not given] 
  [Text] Nelson Mandela spelled out his philosophy of 
government as he prepared yesterday to take over the leadership 
of South Africa, saying: "Let bygones be bygones. Let us heal 
the wounds of the past." 
  The African National Congress president, whose triumph in 
the 
majority-rule elections is expected to be confirmed this 
weekend, placed emphasis on rule by multi-party consensus. 
  Interviewed in the Johannesburg hotel he is using as a 
temporary headquarters, Mr Mandela looked relaxed and confident 
as he outlined his approach to the presidency which will crown 
his life-long battle against the last outpost of 
institutionalised racism. 
  The ANC leader said both police and military commanders had 
swung behind him, and he was confident of achieving the goal of 
national reconciliation. 
  Mr Mandela said it would be an executive presidency, 
dismissing speculation that he would go into semi-retirement as 
a ceremonial head of state. But he said it was crucial that the 
entrenched power-sharing government should not be an empty shell. 
  "If we bring in a political party which has succeeded in 
winning 5 per cent and more of the total votes cast in an 
election, they must feel they are part of a government; they 
must feel they are part and parcel of wielding power," he said. 
  "Even if we emerge with a landslide victory, we have to be 
very careful not to create the fear that the majority is going 
to be used for the purpose of coercing the minorities." 
  The intention, Mr Mandela said, was to maintain in 
government 
the tradition of consensus that had proved so successful in 
constitutional negotiations. Policy had to be "the collective 
responsibility of every political party that is involved in the 
government of national unity". 
  He denied this would lead to governmental parallsis, 
pointing 
out that the negotiations had involved 26 political parties 
"pulling in different directions", but had made "extraordinary 
achievements". 
  "I keep on warning against one organisation -- no matter how 
strong -- taking unilateral decisions in regard to matters that 
require the consultation of all political parties. We have made 
progress since 1990 precisely because we have not forgotten the 
principle that consensus in addressing major national issues is 
critical." 
  Whites, with their training and skills, were vital to the 
future of the country, Mr Mandela said. "That is why we are 
saying to them: `South Africa is your country.'" All South 
Africans, bound together by "a common loyalty and a common love 
for their common fatherland", had to be part of society's 
transformation. 
  The process of consultation should apply even to such issues 
as re-naming streets and landmarks, he said. Changes to symbols 
should be subject to "very intense and patient and serious 
discussions with all the parties that are involved", so as to 
avoid frightening or antagonising minority communities. 
  Mr Mandela hinted that the world's longest-serving foreign 
minister, Pik Botha, might keep his job, indicating which 
members of the National Party would be welcomed into his cabinet. 
  He named Roelf Meyer, the minister of constitutional 
development, Kobie Coetsee, the minister of justice and defence, 
and Leon Wessels, the minister of manpower, as "genuine South 
Africans who want problems solved realistically". He described 
Mr Botha as one of the most enlightened members of the National 
Party. 
  Showing a striking change of attitude towards the security 
forces, Mr Mandela said their "lack of credibility and 
legitimacy is now being wiped out". He said they should be seen 
as representing "the nation and the community". 
  Mr Mandela disclosed that he had addressed the general staff 
of both the police force and the South African Defence Force and 
had held strategy discussions with the police commissioner, 
General Johan van der Merwe, at his home. 
  Once branded a terrorist, Mr Mandela said the police and the 
defence force, as well as the national intelligence service and 
the civil service, would "play an important, if not decisive 
role"in this transformation, and anyone who wants to demonise 
them is rendering a disservice to South Africa". 
  On the question of indemnity, he confirmed that people who 
had committed crimes in the defence of apartheid before October 
1990 would be guaranteed a pardon on the same basis that it had 
been granted to antiapartheid activists. 
  Indemnity for offences committed between October 1990 and 
December 1993 would be subject to the discretion of the new 
parliament. He said his own view on such offenders was that "we 
must consider granting them indemnity". He added: "But you must 
appreciate, of course, that People have lost their families and 
are feeling very bitter, and we will have to consider the 
question case by case in so far as that category is concerned." 
  "But my approach is let bygones be bygones...And we will 
adopt a solution in regard to each case that is influenced by 
that principle." 
  He said the ANC still wanted to set up a truth commission to 
investigate civil rights abuses during the anti-apartheid 
struggle. "The truth commission (and I say we may change the 
name if it creates concern on the part of the security forces) 
is intended to collect evidence to deal with those people who 
want to be indemnified -- not for the purpose of having a 
Nuremberg trial, but for the purpose of granting an indemnity on 
an individual basis." 
  Asked whether this meant the commission would hear evidence 
but keep it secret, Mr Mandela said: "That is what happened when 
we [ANC members] were granted an indemnity. There was no 
disclosure that so-and-so committed this offence. The same 
thing must happen to those who committed offences in defence of 
apartheid." 
  "I don't think we should expose people," he added. 
Confessions would be required only to identify the offence for 
which the indemnity application was being made. "That is the 
end of the matter; he will be granted an indemnity. No [public] 
indication is going to be made what crime he committed." 
  Asked how he intended dealing with rightwing extremists, the 
ANC leader said: "We must never forget that the National Party 
of Mr De Klerk was once in exactly the same position as the 
right wing today." 
  The most important weapon against the right wing, he said, 
was the "dialogue, persuasion, criticism, not coercion", that 
had proved successful against the Nationalists. 
  Mr Mandela disclosed that he had held talks with the 
secretive Broederbond, conservative leaders of the main 
agricultural organisations, and the guru of the right, Carel 
Boshoff. He met the leader of the Freedom Front, General 
Constand Viljoen, four times, the Conservative Party leader, 
Ferdie Hartzenberg, three times, and the whole leadership of the 
Dutch Reformed Church twice. 
  He had done this, he said, "because I wanted this process to 
be inclusive. And I have done well."

<F P=106> [Report on Interview with South Africa's Deputy President, </F>
De Klerk, in London, date not given; "De Klerk's Plea to Win 
Back `Lost Generation'"] 
  [Text] Mr F W de Klerk, South Africa's executive deputy 
vice president, yesterday forecast there would be a coalition 
administration after the government of national unity ended its 
five-year term, and urged the west to help South Africa play a 
constructive role in Africa. 
  In a wide-ranging interview during lunch at the Financial 
Times, Mr de Klerk stressed the importance of economic growth to 
meet the needs of what he called "a lost generation" of South 
Africans. 
  But he also gave a sharp warning against any attempt to 
undermine the status of the Afrikaans language, saying it would 
drive many of his National Party supporters into the arms of the 
far right. 
  A relaxed and good-humoured Mr de Klerk, showing no signs of 
strain after a gruelling election campaign made clear that he 
looked forward to contesting the presidency in the next 
election. 
  The National Party, he said, had won support from about l 
million black voters in addition to over 3 million votes from 
whites, coloureds and Indians. He was determined to help 
make the coalition led by President Nelson Mandela work, he 
said, adding that the National Party would be able to claim a 
share of success when contesting the next election. The party 
accepted the need to tackle housing backlogs and improve health 
and educational facilities for black South Africa -- any 
difference with the ANC was "not about the needs of the people, 
but how you fund the programme." 
  This in turn depended on sustained economic growth, partly 
through export promotion and encouraging foreign investment. 
  He insisted that the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme 
drawn up by the ANC should be treated as the policy not of a 
single party, but of the government of national unity. "But we 
must be assured that we will not give way on the need for fiscal 
discipline", he said. 
  How, Mr de Klerk was asked, could he reconcile support for 
the coalition government and the need for a watchdog opposition 
role? "I am on a learning curve on this," replied Mr de Klerk. 
But from discussions with leaders of coalition governments in 
Europe, he went on, it seemed there were two options. "You can 
either have a continuing argument in a coalition or you can do 
your homework initially... and agree in detail what joint 
policy will be, and then test everything that happens against 
this (agreement)" -- and this was the approach he had adopted. 
  He accepted that there had been some hard bargaining over 
the 
composition of the cabinet, but welcomed the reappointment of Mr 
Derek Keys as finance minister as one of the critical 
portfolios, in addition to agriculture, constitutional affairs, 
as well as his own role as executive vice president. 
  Asked whether the government of national unity could become 
"more or less permanent", Mr de Klerk replied: "Not necessarily 
in this form." 
  "Power sharing", he went on, "should be a feature of the 
final constitution (to be drawn up by the country's National 
Assembly)" arguing, as he has done frequently in the past, that 
a party that gets 51 per cent of the vote should not get 100 per 
cent of the power. 
  But he stressed that "there are other ways of achieving it 
than though an enforced coalition. One would be to give to the 
regions more powers, though not necessarily more functions," he 
said. 
  "For certain types of important decisions the president 
might 
not be able to take them on his own, he must call in the 
premiers of the nine provinces". Alternatively, Mr de Klerk 
suggested, "the senate could more effectively represent minority 
interests, to control the power of the party with the majority." 
  But he underlined the fact that "it is not about vetoes -- 
it 
is about effectively preventing the misuse of power to the 
detriment of language, religion, certain black minority groups". 
  "I don't think we should have enforced coalitions," Mr de 
Klerk went on, "but when (the current system) falls away, we 
need to broaden the package of how to share power in other ways, 
through local government for example." 
  "We have got to balance the situation between the fears of 
minorities and the democratic need to have real power which 
comes with being a majority (party)." 
  "An enforced coalition", he continued, "will not wash, it 
won't work either. But I predict we are going to have 
coalitions any way." 
  Turning to the role of post-apartheid South Africa, Mr de 
Klerk urged the international community "not to remove us from 
their agenda. They need us, they need to address the problems 
of Africa. We have a pivotal role to play -- but only if we are 
successful (at home) can we play that role (in Africa) to the 
full." 
  "We need sustained dynamic economic growth," said Mr de 
Klerk. "We will be focusing on exports and developing the new 
markets that have become available to us, we have to get our 
productivity up, and develop the potential of tourism, with lots 
of jobs." 
  Mr de Klerk was at his most passionate, however when he 
responded to questions about the future of Afrikaans. It was 
"very dangerous" he warned, to undermine the language, pointing 
as an example to the dropping of announcements in Afrikaans on 
board South African Airways. 
  "It was the language issue which made the Afrikaner the 
force 
that they are today...if you want me to lose their support, rub 
them up the wrong way about the language. You will drive back 
into the arms of the far right." 
  Mr de Klerk was reluctant to give reasons for the last 
minute decision of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party, to take part in the election. 
  "Realism took over," he said. "If Chief Buthelezi didn't 
come 
aboard we might have faced a very serious security situation". 
All parties, including Chief Buthelezi, realised this. 
  Mr de Klerk dismissed reports in the South African press 
that 
he had struck a deal to secure Chief Buthelezi's participation, 
giving extra land to the former Kwazulu homeland within Natal. 
"At no time was I involved in any discussion on that issue that 
was election related" 
  Turning to the need for land redistribution, Mr de Klerk 
said 
it was "at tremendously emotional issue with conflict potential" 
but it "can be managed in an orderly way." The government has 
"already identified vast tracts of land" which could be made 
available to people dispossessed during the apartheid era. 
  But Mr de Klerk cautioned against expectations that South 
Africa could play a major role in Rwanda. First the country's 
security forces had successfully to conclude the integration of 
regular units and members of the ANC armed wing. South Africa 
also needed to help resolve disputes closer to home, he said, 
notably the war in Angola. 
  Mr de Klerk was in London to deliver the Sunday Times Nobel 
Laureate lecture. The combination of a strong economy and a 
large middle class placed South Africa "qualitatively and 
quantitively in quite a different league from any other African 
society," he told the audience. "We will be able to break the 
cycle of Third World poverty and despair and we will ensure that 
many of our African neighbours share our success."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Executive Deputy President F.W. de </F>
Klerk by Ivan Fallon in Pretoria; date not given; from the 
SUNDAY TIMES News Review] 
  [Text] Two weeks out of his job as South Africa's state 
president have done nothing to dim the political ambitions of F 
W de Klerk, now the country's executive deputy president. He 
may only have got 20.5 per cent of the 19m votes cast in last 
month's elections, but for a party that carries the stigma and 
apartheid burden of the National party, it was an astonishingly 
high figure. 
  Far from consigning himself to the political graveyard and a 
life of retirement in his Cape Town cottage, de Klerk is already 
planning a political comeback. "I believe my party is poised as 
the party with the greatest growth potential," he says, without 
a flicker of a smile. "We look at the future and in the party 
political sense -- while fully co-operating with the government 
of national unity -- we will be looking for a win in the next 
election." 
  It is a statement which, coming lrom the leader of the 
National party, the same internationally reviled party that for 
more than 40 years deprived blacks of their civil rights and 
stripped the coloureds (mixed-race people) of their right to 
vote, seems bizarre, even absurd. Yet is it? In last month's 
election de Klerk's party won almost 4m votes, possibly as many 
as 1m of them black votes. Fewer than 60 per cent of whites 
voted for him, but probably as many as 70 per cent of coloureds 
and 63 per cent of Indians preferred the new, apartheid cleansed 
National party to any of the other 18 parties that sought their 
vote. 
  I last interviewed de Klerk in his office in Pretoria a week 
before the election when his staff were hoping to achieve 
between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the vote, and some even 
talked about 35 per cent. Against that, his party's showing 
might be viewed as a disappointment. But it was still, he 
points out, the highest figure any opinion poll ever accorded 
them -- and with the national party machine he is now building, 
it can do better next time. 
  "The National party has become the leading non-racial party 
in South Africa," he says, and it is true: the African National 
Congress's support was almost entire black, and Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's support came from the Zulus of Natal and a number of 
disaffected whites. 
  As such, insists de Klerk, the "Nats" should regain not only 
the white votes that went to the Democratic party as well as to 
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party, keep control of the coloureds 
and Indians who are mostly Afrikaans speakers (and more 
anti-black than they were ever anti-white), and attract a 
growing number of aspiring middle-class blacks. For the moment, 
however, de Klerk, in London last week to deliver The Sunday 
Times Nobel Laureate Peace lecture to nearly 3,000 people at the 
Albert Hall, has the more immediate task of making the new 
government of national unity work. In the past fortnight he has 
handed over officially to Nelson Mandela and moved out of the 
state president's office suite once occupied by Smuts, Malan, 
Verwoerd and Botha. 
  His new office will be a mirror suite on the other side of 
the same building, on the same floor as Mandela and only a short 
walk to the office of his fellow "executive" deputy president, 
Thabo Mbeki. 
  The "executive" bit of the title, he says, has been recently 
added to emphasise the fact that the two deputies will play key 
roles in managing the new government. After the election 
Mandela took a brief holiday, leaving de Klerk and Mbeki in 
joint charge, and so far they have not come to blows. 
  "We've already struck a very good working relationship," 
says 
de Klerk, and most observers believe that to be true, the two 
men forming a respect for each other in the months of tough 
negotiation that led up to the election. The two deputy 
presidents are now effectively the joint chief executives of 
South Africa, with Mandela assuming the role of non-executive 
chairman. They have not yet settled into a work routine, but 
have spent the hours and days since the election trying to 
thrash out a system of cabinet committees through which their 
powers will be exercised. 
  Mbeki, like all the ANC, has no experience of government and 
seems prepared to be guided by his more seasoned partner. How 
long the smooth partnership will last under the strains that lie 
just around the corner is another matter, but de Klerk is 
putting an optimistic gloss on it. 
  One of the key points, he insists, is that he is not a 
Mandela appointee. "I'm not there because I've been invited to 
be there. I'm there because the constitution says I've a right 
to be there. because 4m voters said they wanted me there. Even 
if President Mandela disliked me intensely, he would have had to 
accept me." Mandela, in fact, seems to hold him in even greater 
respect than Mbeki does, and although there have been some signs 
of friction between them over several of the cabinet 
appointments, all three of them seem determined to work together. 
  The constitution, says de Klerk, insists that the president 
must consult his deputies on a whole series of important issues, 
notably appointments, and he will make sure that happens to the 
letter. "I see us being involved in the totality." 
  The first real cabinet session takes place tomorrow with 
Mandela in the chair, flanked by his two deputies, and down the 
table the brooding figure of Buthelezi, who has been seen 
striding the floors of the Ministry of Home Affairs where he is 
in charge. This is where the first real tensions could surface. 
  De Klerk has gone out of his way to keep Buthelezi informed 
about the way in which the cabinet committees are developing, 
seeking his support not as a minister but as the head of one of 
the three political parties that make up the government. 
Mandela, he indicates, has done the same and so far Buthelezi 
seems to be settling down to his life as a national minister, as 
opposed to his years of being chief minister in his own little 
fiefdom of KwaZulu. 
  If Buthelezi, says de Klerk, is not drawn into the process 
of 
government, there would be a real danger that the cooperation of 
the parties within the cabinet would falter. "There is a 
commitment from me and from Mandela to make that work." On the 
other hand, de Klerk and Buthelezi are allies against what could 
be the overpowering might of the ANC. "We are not there, and 
Buthelezi isn't there, to implement to the letter ANC policy," 
he says. "That would make a farce of the concept of a 
government of national unity."

place not given: "Malcolm Rifkind Confirms Military Assistance 
to South Africa"] 
  [Text] Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, 
today confirmed that a British Military Advisory and Training 
team [BMATT] will be made available to go to South Africa to 
help build the new National Defence Force. 
  Commanded by a Brigadier, the party of 31 men and women will 
be drawn from all three services and their role will be to 
validate selection criteria and training standards, to monitor 
training across all four arms of the NDF (Army, Navy, Air Force 
and Medical Service) and to adjudicate in any cases where 
disagreements arise. 
  Mr Rifkind said: "I believe that we have one of the best 
military forces in the world, and I am positive their 
experience, expertise and efficiency will be of enormous benefit 
in helping to build the new multi-ethnic armed forces in South 
Africa." 
  It is expected that a core of nine members of the BMATT will 
remain in South Africa on two-year resident tours, while the 
remainder would go for shorter periods of about six months. 
  The unit should be assembled in South Africa by mid-June.

<F P=106> [Interview with RPF leader General Paul Kagame by Massimo </F>
Nava in Kigali; date not given: "Rwanda: Genocide Inevitable"] 
  [Text] Kigali -- At 37 years of age, and with the face of a 
math teacher, which he used to be before becoming a soldier, 
General Paul Kagame is the leader of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] rebels which is conquering the country after seven weeks 
of civil war and massacres: at least half a million dead and 
1.5 million evacuated out of a population of eight million. 
  He met with me in his headquarters on the outskirts of 
Kigali 
at a time when the RPF was laying siege to the city: The 
appointment was agreed to three days ago with the guerrillas, 
who escorted me through this tormented country along secure 
tracks now under their control. They put me up for a night in 
Gahini, near the hospital, which is overflowing with wounded and 
mutilated. 
  [Nava] So general, is genocide the price of victory? 
  [Kagame] The victims are the consequence of Rwanda's 
political history. We had to eliminate an absolute dictatorship 
and allow more than a million exiles to return home. I myself 
had to leave the country when I was a child. This is not a 
tribal conflict, like many people in Europe think, but a war of 
liberation. Now the people are on our side because they 
understand that there is no sense in living if you do not have 
rights. 
  [Nava] But could you not have avoided the massacres of women 
and children, and tens of thousands of civilians? 
  [Kagame] The RPF is not responsible for the massacres. We 
knew that the government and the presidential guard were 
preparing to eliminate the political opposition and those social 
groups which were against the regime. The international 
observers -- who were unable to intervene -- knew this too. I 
formally accuse the international community, and I accuse France 
in particular, which supplied arms and training to the militia. 
  [Nava] You accuse France of supporting the government of 
Rwanda. Who supports and arms the RPF? You grew up in Uganda, 
studied in the United States, and were a senior official in the 
Ugandan Army. 
  [Kagame] Rwandan exiles throughout Africa and Europe are 
funding the movement. We buy arms and ammunition on the black 
market. Recently we acquired a package in Somalia. We are not 
rebels with a political color, but a patriotic movement. 
  [Nava] It is true that the majority of the victims are 
Tutsis, in other words the same ethnic group as yourself, but 
your soldiers have not been there to watch either. Tens of 
thousands of people, mostly Hutus, fled to Tanzania when you 
arrived. 
  [Kagame] We have to make a distinction between those who 
died 
in battle and those who committed atrocities against civilians. 
The presidential guard exterminated Tutsis, as well as the Hutu 
opposition. However, we are making inquiries among our soldiers 
too. 
  [Nava] If you take power, will you agree to an international 
inquiry? 
  [Kagame] With open arms. However, the observers should also 
look into the crimes committed in the past by the ruling class: 
an unscrupulous oligarchy bent on keeping its power at any 
price. 
  [Nava] The assassinated president [Habyarimana], however, 
had 
signed agreements which should have led to national 
reconciliation. 
  [Kagame] Only on paper. It was always that way in the past. 
There are various explanations making the rounds as regards the 
assassination: Some say it was a plot by the Belgians and the 
Americans to eliminate him and, obviously, there are those who 
suspect our involvement, but I think it was the work of the most 
conservative factions. 
  [Nava] Now, the Tutsis are returning to power, as in the 
past 
when they were the kings of Rwanda. The massacres could be 
repeated in a few years. 
  [Kagame] The RPF president is a Hutu. I am a Tutsi, but 
thousands of militants are Hutus. In the past, it was not the 
Tutsis who governed but, as is the case now, a small clan which 
was the expression of the king. We are seeking to build up a 
genuine national movement which represents everyone, and which 
expresses a Rwandan identity without making distinctions. We 
speak the same language and we practice the same religion. The 
conflict is not ethnic, but economic and political. 
  [Nava] Nevertheless, the rivalries and hate still run deep. 
How can one explain all this beastliness in one of the gentlest 
and most hospitable peoples in Africa? 
  [Kagame] The people have been kept in a state of 
underdevelopment and have been educated to hate to such an 
extent that they behave like primitives. However, I am 
convinced that national reconciliation is possible if there is 
economic development and democracy. 
  [Nava] All guerrilla leaders promise the same things before 
taking power. Rwanda brings to mind the Cambodia of Pol Pot. 
  [Kagame] I ask to be put to the test. We want a democratic 
system and a free market. There will be a transition period to 
pave the way for free elections. In the meantime, we are 
prepared to engage in a dialogue with everyone, even with our 
most convinced opponents. 
  [Nava] Even with the leaders of the presidential guard? 
  [Kagame] With everyone, but not with killers -- primarily 
the 
political officials in the government. Those who laid the plans 
for genocide must be punished. 
  [Nava] Is a cease-fire possible? 
  [Kagame] That is not up to us. So far, the truces have been 
broken by them. We cannot allow a truce to make more massacres 
possible. 
  [Nava] What will Paul Kagame's future be? 
  [Kagame] I would sincerely like to dedicate myself to my 
private life, to my wife and my two children who live in 
Brussels. However, I am a soldier and this is my duty. I do not 
think I will go into politics, but I do not have time now to 
think about my future. [Kagame ends] 
  The "technical" jeep with escort was waiting for him. The 
general, in an unadorned uniform, is going to the front line, 
confirming his reputation as a tough man and a fanatic for 
discipline, despite his gentle manners and soft voice. "The 
government forces are resisting, but they have wasted many 
weapons and a lot of soldiers are coming over to our side. I 
think the war will end very soon." On Saturday evening [28 
May], the government forces abandoned Gitarama, south of Kigali, 
and fled toward Zaire.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with President Yoweri Museveni by Mark </F>
Huband in Kampala on 5 May] 
  [Text] Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, called on rebel 
forces in Rwanda last night to allow a limited foreign military 
intervention to stop the carnage which has left up to 200,000 
people dead in the country -- and he became the first leader in 
the region to accuse Rwanda's government openly of using 
genocide to eliminate opposition. 
  President Museveni has close ties with the anti-government 
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and his call for a foreign role is 
likely to have a strong impact on it. 
  The rebels have condemned the United Nations for all but 
pulling out of Rwanda when the killings began in early April, 
and then planning a return which could halt the rebel advance 
through the country. 
  President Museveni condemned the current government in 
Rwanda 
for its involvement in the slaughter but called on foreign 
countries, and the UN, to understand the real nature of the 
crisis before sending in troops. 
  "The international community -- some of them don't know that 
it is the policy of government (in Rwanda) to use genocide as an 
instrument of eliminating opposition. I think if there was that 
understanding then the view of the situation would change. 
  "Everybody would know that it is a criminal band, just like 
the Nazis, (which is responsible for the killing), and then the 
whole international community would hunt them down," he said in 
his first interview with a foreign newspaper since the Rwanda 
crisis erupted on April 6. 
  "But I think there could be a basis for some limited involve 
ment; for instance, on purely humanitarian issues -- 
distributing food, rescuing civilians threatened by the 
massacres promoting a dialogue among the parties -- for a 
limited period, not indefinitely, and without attempting to 
influence the politicians of the countries." 
  He stressed that the RPF should accept such an intervention, 
as its forces could not move quickly enough to save lives still 
under threat from government death squads operating in the 
capital and the south and west of the country. 
  "The RPF needs to give the chance to the international 
community. Because now people think it,s merely a struggle for 
power by the two groups." 
  The UN secretary-general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the 
Americans have discussed the Rwanda crisis with President 
Museveni. Uganda has been accused by the Rwandan government of 
supplying the RPF with arms. This has been denied by President 
Museveni, whose close ties with the RPF stem from the support 
its personnel gave him during the civil war which brought him to 
power in 1986. 
  But his approval of an intervention stems as much from 
concerns about the Rwanda crisis spilling over into neighbouring 
countries, particularly Burundi, as it does from the impact on 
Rwanda itself. 
  "The Rwandese parties, and the parties in Burundi, must know 
that mismanagement in their countries also affects other 
countries. So they cannot say their problem is entirely 
internal... Genocide isn't part of internal affairs. Internal 
affairs is how you govern yourself. But genocide has never been 
part of internal affairs." 
  The impact of the failure of the American-led UN military 
intervention in Somalia last year continues to dominate 
discussions about the appropriate response to crises. 
  "One weakness of international involvement is that they 
don't 
talk on the basis of justice," the Ugandan leader said. 
  "They don't ask the question of who is right and who is 
wrong 
in this case. They just come and want to smother the problems 
-- to put a canvas over rotten eggs. And as long as the smell 
in the room is suppressed then the problem is solved."

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with Jaques Matanda, member </F>
of the executive bureau of the Sacred Union of Radical 
Opposition, by Ruben G. Abelanda in Luanda, Angola; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] Zairian leader Mobutu Sese 
Seko, who has been in office for nearly three decades, remains 
in power thanks to the close ties he has maintained with the 
U.S. CIA since taking power on 24 November 1965. 
  Jaques Matanda, a member of the Executive Bureau of the 
Zairian Sacred Union of Radical Opposition (USOR), currently 
Mobutu's major opposition force, made this statement during an 
exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA in Luanda, the Angolan 
capital. 
  During a lengthy discussion, Matanda charged that the ties 
between the chief of the Kinshasa regime and the U.S. 
intelligence service date back to before the military coup that 
brought him to power. 
  The USOR leader and supporter of Etienne Tshisekedi, the 
political figure heading the opposition in the former Belgian 
Congo, stated that Mobutu was responsible for the murder of the 
country's leader Patrice Lumumba. 
  At that time, the current Zairian president was Lumumba's 
secretary and later became the chief of the Army's General 
Staff, a position he used to work in favor of the interests of 
the U.S. Government, which at that time was basically interested 
in stopping liberation movements on the African continent and 
preventing the installation of progressive systems, Matanda 
recalled. 
  He added that Lumumba, who fought for the liberation of the 
people of the continent, was a figure not to Washington's liking 
because of his support for the region's political and economic 
independence. 
  This happened at the time of the Cold War, the height of the 
socialist community led by the now defunct Soviet Union, and a 
period in which Washington struggled against what it referred to 
as communist expansion, he added. 
  He noted that Mobutu undoubtedly appeared as an important 
spearhead of U.S. administrations in Africa, a role he performed 
to the letter and which reaped him countless benefits. 
  According to Matanda, Mobutu was given a green light to 
control Zaire any way he wanted, despite the fact that he was 
repeatedly accused of violating human rights, embezzling from 
the national treasury, and using corruption as a means to 
silence foes and win over supporters. 
  The USOR leader added that this is how Mobutu has managed to 
maintain a regime that has not adjusted to the democratic model, 
a model to be applied in Africa, as well as throughout the Third 
World, according to speeches by politicians in Washington, and 
how he has blocked attempts by his adversaries to install a 
democratic regime in Zaire. 
  Matanda admitted that today, Mobutu lacks the open support 
he 
once had for nearly 30 years from the U.S., French, and Belgian 
Governments, but, he added it is also true that conservative 
sectors with abundant financial resources in those three 
countries, primarily in Washington and Paris, are still 
providing him with vital assistance. 
  Otherwise, in Matanda's opinion, the chief of the Kinshasa 
regime would have been ousted by the strong pressure his 
opponents have been exerting to create a democratic and 
pluralist system in Zaire in line with those installed in almost 
every African state since the beginning of the 1990's. 
  Since the start of the struggle for a transition toward 
democracy in Zaire, USOR (which groups the country's major 
opposition forces) has worked peacefully to pressure Mobutu into 
accepting the challenge of multiparty elections, he added. 
  He said, however, that peaceful means do not appear to be 
the 
way to convince someone who is willing to kill to remain in 
power and who continues to enrich himself at the cost of the 
growing acute poverty suffered by the Zairian people. 
  In the interviewee's opinion, there will be no other 
alternative left but to begin an armed struggle if Mobutu 
insists on hampering the installation of a democratic system in 
the country. 
  Matanda's remarks coincide with the views of African 
political analysts who feel "times of war are looming over Zaire 
unless the severe socioeconomic deterioration of that country is 
halted. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
  According to various sources, the situation is already 
explosive, but Mobutu's exit from the political scene could ease 
the tension and prevent an armed conflict in the future. 
  Despite the disapperance of the alleged communist expansion, 
Mobutu continues to be an important part of Washington's and 
Paris' economic and political interests in Africa. 
  It is no secret that the United States and France are vying 
for greater economic control in that region of the world.

  [Excerpt] President Idriss Deby yesterday visited Aozou in 
the far north of Chad following the official restoration of the 
Aozou Strip by Libya to Chad. On that occasion, the Chadian 
head of state decided to upgrade the Aozou administrative post, 
the only locality in that 114,000-square-km desert area to 
subprefecture status. The Aozou Strip was handed over to the 
Chadian authorities yesterday after more than 20 years of Libyan 
occupation. For many people, Libya is trying, by that gesture, 
to gain increased African support in its efforts to get the 
United Nations to lift sanctions against it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 1 Jun (PANA) -- Machine-gun fire was 
heard last night in [words indistinct], who wanted to march 
towards the presidency to demand their integration into the 
National Army. These youth known as the "Aubevillois" [new 
recruits] were given accelerated military training to form the 
private militia of the presidential group -- the ruling 
coalition -- in order to fight the opposition militia. 
  Shooting by the head of state's guards created panic in 
nearby schools where students and teachers hurriedly ended 
classes and fled. The "Aubevillois" responded with machine-gun 
fire last night in the southern Brazzaville districts of Diata 
and Mfilou where most presidential group supporters live. 
Shooting was also heard in Bacongo District, the opposition 
stronghold, and in the "Plateau des 15 Ans" District. 
  The situation has since returned to normal in these 
districts, where people are going about their normal daily 
business. The number of casualties from these incidents is not 
yet known but according to a military source there were no 
casualties. 
  Meanwhile, the Congolese National Assembly last night asked 
the government and the Congolese Armed Forces High Command to 
explain the arms and ammunition theft at the noncommissioned 
officers' school at Gamboma, 325 km north of Brazzaville.

  [Text] Congo's President Lissouba seems to have an 
unfortunate facility in putting people's back up. Not only has 
he had a virtual civil war in Brazzaville with the hostile 
opposition but now has apparently upset some of the young men 
who fought the opposition militias on the president's side. In 
January, President Lissouba made some promises, he hasn't kept 
them and yesterday there was gunfire around the president's 
residence. From Brazzaville, Antoine Muyumbala telexed this 
report: 
  Members of the Presidential Guard fired shots into the air 
yesterday afternoon to disperse a crowd of young supporters of 
President Lissouba who were marching toward his official 
residence to demand that they be recruited into the regular 
Army. To continue their protest, these young men fired guns all 
night long into Brazzaville's southern district of Diata. The 
districts of Diata Mfilou are controlled by Lissouba supporters 
while the zones of Bacongo and Makelekele are in the hands of 
the opposition. 
  There was also some fire in the opposition districts last 
night. Brazzaville was calm this morning. For some months now, 
young presidential supporters have been asking to be included 
into the Army following Pascal Lissouba's promise in January to 
recruit members of all private militias into the Army.

  [Text] Kigali, June 1 (AFP) -- The UN military chief in 
Rwanda, General Romeo Dallaire, on Wednesday [1 June] met 
Rwandan rebel leader Paul Kagame to discuss security for UN 
operations the day after a peacekeeper was killed, a UN 
spokesman said. "The safety of the UN troops is very high on 
the agenda," military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said as 
the two went into talks. 
  UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said one attempt had been made to 
deliver food in Kigali, which is under siege by Kagame's Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF), but the UN vehicle came under fire. "We 
do not know who shot at it," Kabia said, adding that nobody was 
hurt in the incident. 
  All UN humanitarian operations, including the distribution 
of 
food, otherwise remained halted for the day, pending guarantees 
of safety from the warring parties, UN sources said. 
  The UN mission in Rwanda suspended relief operations after a 
Senegalese army captain was killed Tuesday when a shell 
apparently fired at government army positions by the RPF 
exploded near his car. 
  The United Nations had earlier Tuesday continued to evacuate 
hundreds of civilians caught up in the bloodshed to safer 
positions behind the lines respectively of the mainly Tutsi 
rebels and the Hutu majority government forces. 
  UN officials refused to specify where Dallaire, a Canadian, 
and Kagame, were meeting on Wednesday, saying only that it was 
"somewhere in Rwanda". 
  Up to 500,000 Rwandans are estimated to have been killed 
since the beginning of April, while half a million others have 
fled abroad. Hundreds of thousands of people are internally 
displaced. 
  The Senegalese officer was the 12th UN soldier to lose his 
life in Rwanda.

  [Excerpts] Niger workers of the public sector this morning 
embarked on their first general, indefinite strike at the 
request of the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger [USTN]. 
Parastatals will not follow the indefinite strike, but they 
will experience disruptions in labor through periodic strikes. 
The USTN is demanding, among other things, the abrogation of a 
decree regulating strikes in the civil service and a 30- to 
50-percent increase in salary. Several people in Niamey and in 
the provinces have condemned this indefinite strike, which they 
say will be suicidal for educational institutions in Niger. 
These institutions run the risk of experiencing three invalid 
academic years within four. 
  In a communique issued yesterday evening, the government 
spokesman condemned the intransigence of the labor union and 
threatened to enforce the existing laws on any worker who will 
not report for work. However, the government confirmed its 
readiness to create the conditions for a sincere partnership. 
Here is the minister of communications, Massaoudou Hassoumi: 
  [Begin Hassoumi recording] [passage omitted] Out of the 
seven-point demands there was total agreement on five, a partial 
agreement on one point, and a disagreement on one point. The 
calm which prevailed throughout the negotiations, and the 
impression created that both sides admit to important results 
having been achieved, did not hint that the labor union was 
going to maintain its indefinite strike order. The government 
reiterates its readiness to create conditions for a sincere 
partnership. However, in the face of the labor union's 
intransigence to maintain its strike order, the government 
reaffirms its firm determination to strictly enforce provisions 
regulating strikes. It calls on workers who care for the future 
for the future of our country to report for work. Thank you.

  [Text] Lagos, June 1 (AFP) -- Anti-government demonstrators 
took to the streets on the outskirts of Lagos on Wednesday [1 
June] a day after an ultimatum from pro-democracy groups to 
Nigeria's junta to stand down expired, an opposition spokesman 
said. 
  An official in the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights 
told AFP that protestors had put up barricades in northern 
suburbs and also blockaded roads leading out of Nigeria's 
economic capital to the east and to the west. Eyewitnesses 
confirmed that protestors had put up roadblocks and set tyres on 
fire in Abule Egba, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) outside the 
centre of the sprawling metropolis. 
  The rights committee spokesman said the demonstrations began 
the morning after a deadline given by the National Democratic 
Campaign (NADECO) to the regime of General Sani Abacha to stand 
down expired at midnight Tuesday. The protests in the suburbs 
were "a symbolic action in support of the NADECO agenda and to 
register their (the people's) displeasure against continued 
military rule," the spokesman said, asking not to be named. 
  National radio began broadcasts Wednesday with a warning to 
NADECO from police chief Ibrahim Coomassie that a ban on 
political activity and public gatherings remained in force. 
  The police chief called on "all genuine advocates" of 
democracy to take part in a national constitutional conference 
the regime plans to organise from June 27 as a key point of its 
programme to restore elected civilian rule. Any other political 
programmes would be considered "illegal," Coommassie warned. 
  The NADECO, which comprises many prominent Nigerians, 
including former government ministers and state governors, 
retired military figures and rights activists, has dismissed the 
planned conference as a ruse by the military to hold on to power. 
  It called on Abacha, who seized power last November and 
scrapped all Nigeria's democratic institutions, to go by 
midnight on March 31 [as received] and hand over to Moshood 
Abiola, held millionaire businessman held on unofficial results 
comfortably to have won a presidential election. 
  That poll, held on June 12 last year, was billed free and 
fair by international observers but annulled by then military 
ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. 
Two months later, Babangida stepped down, installing an 
unelected civilian adminstration, which Abacha ousted. 
  Abiola on Tuesday told journalists at his Lagos home that 
"if 
NADECO calls on me to form a government, I will form a 
government." "Abacha is a goner," he said. 
  The military administrator of Lagos State, Colonel 
Olagunsoye 
Oyinlola, for his part warned that police had been put on alert 
to prevent any breaches of the peace. 
  The annulment of the poll last year led to bloody 
demonstrations in several parts of Lagos. Residents of some 
city districts continued Wednesday to stock up on food, hiking 
the prices of basics such as rice, for fear of trouble. 
  Abiola, a Moslem from the Yoruba ethnic group with support 
notably in southwest Nigeria, said he had contacted a number of 
leading Nigerians with a view to forming a national unity 
government. 
  Africa's most populous nation, with some 88 million people, 
has many ethnic groups, of which the largest are the Yorubas and 
Ibos of the mainly Christian south and the Hausa-Fulani of the 
predominantly Moslem north.

  [Text] Lagos, 1 Jun (AFP) -- The dissolved Nigerian Senate 
this evening declared the ruling military administration 
"illegal" and called for "the official publication of the 
results of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections, canceled by 
the soldiers. 
  In a communique signed by its president, Ameh Ebute, a copy 
of which has reached AFP, the senate "decides to restore all 
democratic institutions" of Nigeria, "calls for the publication 
of the results of the June 12 election", and the "formation of a 
government of national unity and reconciliation...by the elected 
president." 
  Moshood Abiola, the billionaire Yoruba Muslim, claims to 
have 
won the 12 June 1993 elections on the basis of official results 
published in each of the 30 states of the federation after the 
closure of polling stations, and collected by his supporters. 
These results were never officially published by the National 
Electoral Commission in Abuja, the federal capital, as 
stipulated by the Constitution. This is because the former 
administration of General Ibrahim Babangida said the elections 
were full of irregularities which, up to now, have not been 
proved. 
  The Senate and all democratic institutions of Nigeria were 
dissolved on 18 November 1993 by General Abacha, 24 hours after 
his sudden takeover of power in the country.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] One of the catalysts of opposition in Nigeria has 
been the election of the consultative constitutional conference, 
known locally as the Confab, which is supposed to draw up a new 
political dispensation. It seems to have sharpened the resolve 
of those who look back at the annulled elections of 12 June last 
year and want those results reinstated. Now a new opposition 
group is emerging of senators elected last year but who lost 
their jobs when the Senate was disbanded along with all other 
institutions when General Abacha seized power. A number of 
senators say that they are going to reform the Senate, among 
them is Segun Bame Gbetan who was elected senator for Oshun 
East. On the line Akoi Amusu asked him if it wasn't a bit late 
to be reviving the Senate. 
  [Begin recording] [Gbetan] Well, we have made this move 
because since the annulment of the results of 12 June 1993 
election, we feel that there is no other way but to try to 
resolve both the annulment of the results of that election and 
to get the Senate and in fact the National Assembly back to 
function. So, that is the general consensus now that the 
senators have also come together that we should get the 
democratic structures back in place. 
  [Amusu] But aren't you just causing confusion? I mean, the 
Abacha government is now in the process of setting up a 
constitutional conference. It has held elections and 
everything. So, why are you now suddenly coming out to say that 
you want the old Senate to meet? 
  [Gbetan] Well, it is accepted that there may have been some 
confusion about the strategy and the style to adopt but the goal 
has always been the same: The goal of the political class is the 
same as the military government of General Abacha. Both want to 
install lasting democracy and whether it is through Confab or 
through general resolution, the goal is the same. So, I think 
now if you have a general resolution, the Confab may not be 
necessary. 
  [Amusu] But Gen. Abacha doesn't want you old politicians to 
come out of the woodwork. He wants to start afresh with a clean 
slate. 
  [Gbetan] No, there is no intention on the part of Gen. 
Abacha 
to leave out any particular group. That was why everybody was 
allowed to contest and quite a number of senators contested and 
won election into the Confab. 
  [Amusu] So, what you are suggesting is that the Abacha 
government should just forget about the constitutional 
conference, what you are calling a Confab, and just let you 
senators sort it all out. 
  [Gbetan] Yes, I believe that is a very viable alternative to 
the Confab. 
  [Amusu] But you see, if Gen. Abacha is being asked to accept 
your election in those elections of last year as being valid, 
then why shouldn't he accept the election of Moshood Abiola 
whose election as president has been annulled? 
  [Gbetan] Yes, Gen. Abacha and his government have distanced 
themselves from the illegal annulment of that election and I 
believe they are working towards restoring the results of that 
election. 
  [Amusu] But they've showed no signs of that. They have shown 
absolutely no signs of their intent to reinstall Chief Abiola as 
president of Nigeria. In fact, on the contrary, they seem to be 
doing everything to avoid that. 
  [Gbetan] Well, I believe that what they have not done is to 
try to do it by military fiat or by executive fiat and that is 
by trying to go through the Confab and particularly General Diya 
has said that they will abide by the decision of the Confab and 
I think the feeling in the country today is that the Confab 
should go there and resolve that issue and get Chief M.K. Abiola 
to form his government. [end recording]

  [Text] The Nigeria police has declared as illegal any 
political programs outside those of the Federal Government. In 
a statement in Lagos today, the inspector general of police, 
Ibrahim Commassie, warned that any attempt to install another 
government other than the present federal military government by 
any person or group of persons, will be repelled with force. 
The inspector general of police said that the federal military 
government, in its genuine effort to return the country to a 
democratic rule, has set in motion a program to achieve the 
goal. He said the fact that the present military administration 
has continued to guarantee freedom of expression, should not be 
used to cause public disorder. The police therefore advised 
members of the public to go about their lawful businesses as 
their safety is guaranteed. 
  The statement added that the Nigerian police and other 
security agents, are fully prepared to deal decisively with any 
person or group of persons who decide to break the public peace 
or stand as an obstacle to the march toward a lasting democracy.

  [Text] The Nigerian police has warned that any person, 
whether a politician, retired military officer or prodemocracy 
crusader trying to install another government will be dealt with 
decisively by security agencies. The warning followed 
publications indicating that Chief M.K.O. Abiola will be sworn 
in as president of this country on the 12th of this month. 
  In a statement signed by the inspector general of police, 
Alhaji Ibrahim Commassie, the police reminded the public that 
there was a military government running the affairs of the 
nation and that the freedom of expression guaranteed by the 
administration will not be abused. The statement noted that 
some of the publications have even speculated those to be 
appointed into the cabinet and observed that those mentioned 
were sufficiently knowledgeable to understand the implications 
of such illegal acts. It has also warned Chief M.K.O Abiola and 
his [words indistinct] and those who (?are pretending) to be 
fighting his cause, of the grave consequences of these 
treasonable acts as provided for in the [words indistinct].

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] All the national dailies today report the warning 
handed to the newly formed National Democratic Coalition, 
NADECO, by the inspector general of police, Alhaji Ibrahim 
Commassie. 
  The papers say Alhaji Ibrahim yesterday declared NADECO an 
illegal political body, warning its members to desist from 
confronting the government. According to the papers, the police 
boss warned NADECO of the consequences of its activities which 
the police was not ready to tolerate. They say Alhaji Commassie 
ordered the group to wind up its activities or face the wrath of 
the law. The papers say the inspector general's warning came 
amid public anxiety over the expiration today of NADECO's 
ultimatum to the military government to relinquish power. 
  And the dailies also report that NADECO has unfolded the 
agenda aimed at restoring democracy in Nigeria. They quote a 
member of the group as saying that the struggle to restore 
democratic rule in the country will not necessarily be a 
confrontation with the military but will involve the 
participation of all patriotic Nigerians. The papers quote a 
statement by NADECO urging Nigerians to remain resolute in their 
demand for democracy. 
  THE PUNCH and THE VANGUARD report that the group also 
demanded the resignation of democrats and progressives in 
government who, according to it, have been lending credibility 
to the military administration. The group's ultimatum to the 
Abacha administration to hand over power to a democratic 
national government expired last night. 
  "Federal Government Keeps M.K.O. Under Close Watch" -- the 
TRIBUNE: The paper reports that a secret security network has 
been woven around Chief M.K.O. Abiola, apparently to prevent him 
from making any move that might undermine the authority of the 
government. The TRIBUNE notes that though there have been no 
overt moves to restrict his movement, Chief Abiola is believed 
to be tailed by security agents who also monitor his interaction 
with people. The paper reports that the fresh security measures 
might have been adopted in a move widely interpreted as 
government's reaction to threats by prodemocracy groups to wrest 
power from it. 
  THE VANGUARD reports that the Nigerian Government has given 
the National Constitutional Conference the green light to 
discuss the annulled 12 June election when it convenes this 
month. The issue, according to the report, will be discussed 
under a broad topic: Sanctity of Democracy and the Democratic 
Process. According to THE VANGUARD, the issue has been placed 
under Item 28 in the conference agenda.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good afternoon. The government ultimatum to the 
mediator has begun to bear fruit. Over the past few hours the 
government mediating team asked Alioune Blondin Beye to play his 
true role or else it would publicly expose a number of 
situations that it regards as incorrect and prejudicial to the 
negotiating process. 
  The government ultimatum led Blondin Beye to redouble his 
contacts with National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola's [UNITA] men with a view to convincing them to return to 
the negotiating table at once. The dosage administered by the 
government representatives worked like a wonder drug. 
Accordingly, this morning the mediator received in his room the 
government and UNITA chief negotiators. It is believed that 
issues relating to the adoption of a working agenda were 
discussed during the meeting. It is already known that the 
government is staying put, in that it will only discuss other 
points of the agenda once the issue under discussion -- the 
future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel -- has 
been settled. 
  The UNITA negotiating team appears to be calmer because it 
already knows what government posts will be assigned to that 
organization. Yesterday, the UNITA delegation received the 
government document on this issue. Since silence is golden, the 
contents of the government document are not known, except that a 
number of ministerial portfolios have been given to UNITA. 
  The government and UNITA chief negotiators are scheduled to 
meet the mediator as of 1530 today.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The impasse is over. The negotiating teams have 
already resumed their talks, but only at the level of heads of 
delegation. With the presence of the mediator and observers, the 
heads of the government and UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] teams once again discussed UNITA's 
Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel]. Agreement 
has been reached, and tomorrow night the last day Vorgan will be 
discussed. Should that be the case, the negotiators will begin 
discussing UNITA's participation in government. 
  On 28 May the government sent a document to UNITA through 
the 
mediator, stating what ministerial and deputy ministerial 
portfolios it would give that organization within the framework 
of national reconciliation. To prevent further delays, 
President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos sent a special 
envoy to Lusaka. He is General (Gopelipa), who delivered the 
document to Beye. The UN representative received the document 
and locked it in his drawer, only delivering it to UNITA on 31 
May. 
  The UNITA negotiating team is assessing the government 
proposal. Jorge Valentim says it is not a bad proposal because 
obstacles have been removed. 
  What matters is that the war should end. The talks will 
continue tomorrow, but only at the level of heads of delegations 
and the mediator.

  [Excerpts] National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] rebels have stepped up their attacks and shelling 
of the city of Cuito in the past 24 hours. Government forces 
remain determined to defend the martyred civilians. 
  Between 2100 on 31 May and dawn today, UNITA fired more than 
1,500 shells at the city of Cuito. Attacks were also carried 
out in just about every corner of the city, with government 
defensive lines coming under intense fire. UNITA has 
strengthened its positions that keep the city under siege. The 
aim is to storm the city of Cuito before the Lusaka talks end. 
Troops from Andulo continue to move around the city to once 
again try to fulfill what Mr. Savimbi often refers to as the 
final assault. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, in Moxico Province, UNITA raided the [name 
indistinct] Ward, 18 km north of the city of Luena at dawn 
today. The ward was set alight and 153 civilians were left 
homeless. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Civilian targets, such as health clinics and other 
public installations, are still targets of the vast program of 
destruction of the Luanda warmongering leaders. Our 
correspondent Jardim Prata reports from Cuito: 
  [Begin Prata recording] Two Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] Su-23 aircraft from 
Catumbela Air Base bombed the Bie Central Hospital, dropping 
eight highly toxic chemical bombs, completely destroying the 
[words indistinct] and emergency wards, which are still burning. 
The population is very worried about this political and tribal 
genocide perpetrated by the MPLA-PT. We will give further 
details later on. [end recording] 
  The central hospital of the city of Bie [Cuito] has been 
burning since 1300 yesterday, when incendiary and chemical bombs 
were dropped by Jose Eduardo dos Santos' aircraft. The 
residents, who are tired of war, request the international 
community to help end this hideous MPLA-PT massacre of 
defenseless civilians, in which children and women suffer the 
most as a result of the Futungo de Belas absurdity. 
  The central city of Bie is suffering violent clashes, and 
yesterday evening considerable blood was shed. The main targets 
of Eduardo dos Santos' organizations are [word indistinct] and 
Hotel Cuito, where attacking People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] are losing lethal materiel, as well 
as its best commanders and a high number of soldiers. Jardim 
Prata reports: 
  [Begin Prata recording] Over the past 48 hours, the glorious 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] counterattacked 
MPLA soldiers and killed 57 FAPLA soldiers, including four 
officers, an unidentified lieutenant colonel and three majors 
named Lito, Joao, and Pedrito, respectively the commanders of 
the first and second FAPLA battalions [as heard]. UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] forces 
captured 21 AK-47 weapons, 11 RPG-7's, 11 PKM submachine guns 
with 40 ammunition belts, 3 R-4 weapons, and a considerable 
quantity of AK and PKM ammunition. Meanwhile, FAPLA are still 
[word indistinct] FALA defense lines. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the situation is not very different in Lunda 
Norte 
Province. The Luanda regime also has its criminal apparatus in 
the area and is bent on exterminating the civilian population at 
all costs. An Su-25 aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs 
over the Luzamba mining post in Cafunfo by 1130 on 31 May. Four 
hours later, by 1500, a similar aircraft raided the Muquelele 
ward in the Cafunfo commune, as well as the Luremo commune, 
killing two civilians and wounding many others, two seriously. 
  Americo Tomas, Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
reporter in Cabinda Province, reports that the Luanda regime is 
waging an offensive in Necuto, Beira-a-Nova, Chapa, and Ganda 
Cango areas, north of the province. Over the past 72 hours, 53 
civilians were killed and about 100 others wounded, causing many 
people to take refuge abroad. The FAPLA operations are run by 
General Jose Pedro, a man without scruples, who in 1991 ordered 
the massacre of Choa, which spread all over the province killing 
more than 1,000 civilians. 
  In view of yet another MPLA military offensive, FALA's 
command in Cabinda yesterday said it would not fold its arms 
when lives of civilians are at stake.

  [Text] Registration of voters for the upcoming October 
general and multiparty elections began in Mozambique today. 
President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano registered as a 
voter this morning at the station operating in the Josina Machel 
High School near the Ponta Vermelha palace, the official 
residence of the Mozambican head of state. Afterwards, Chissano 
gave an interview to journalists covering the event. The 
journalists wanted to know what assistance the president of the 
republic would give to resolve the transportation problem 
hindering the electoral process. 
  [Begin recording] [Chissano] We are aware of the shortage of 
transportation, even for state and government activities. There 
are even government administrators and heads of administrative 
regions who walk. We would like every vehicle to be used fully 
so that government departments and the National Elections 
Commission [CNE] may successfully accomplish their missions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Transportation difficulties 
have 
to a certain extent affected the integration of Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] areas, even [words indistinct] 
Renamo says its advisers lack the facilities to ensure the full 
integration of its areas into state administration. The 
registration of voters is under way, but reports from the 
provinces say it has been difficult to reach Renamo areas. So, 
one could say the government and Renamo bear a degree of 
responsibility, in that the former has not created facilities 
for Renamo advisers and the latter is preventing people from 
entering its areas. Would you like to comment? 
  [Chissano] The question of transportation for Renamo 
advisers 
is a false one. I have just said there are administrators who 
have no transportation whatsoever. Yet, they continue to carry 
out their activities. As for the advisers, they are not 
advising Renamo, but the governors. They have been named by 
Renamo to be appointed by the government as advisers to 
governors. They work under the same conditions as other 
officials serving provincial governors. So, that is a false 
problem because no one ever said vehicles would be allocated to 
every official. What was said was that an adviser was entitled 
to transportation. That means the use of public transportation, 
if available, or facilities that have fortunately been provided 
by communities so that our officials may operate. So, that is a 
false excuse. 
  [Correspondent] How do you view the difficulties Renamo has 
created [words indistinct] it seems that in most provinces the 
(?CNE) teams have been (?prevented) from operating? 
  [Chissano] Really, I think Renamo has some difficulties. It 
had problems in filling certain teams of district electoral 
commissions. They have been recruiting personnel in districts 
and areas. We know of people who used to work for us, but who 
have been recruited by Renamo. So, Renamo is recruiting people. 
  I would like to say that the integration of areas has 
already 
begun. I announced it at the opening of the meeting of Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front] cadres yesterday. The minister of 
state administration today met with the Reintegration 
Commission. Areas have been identified. We have appealed to 
Renamo to name those who will be appointed to state agencies at 
location, district, and administrative region levels. This is 
something that is in progress. So, I think every difficulty 
will be overcome. I believe Renamo is facing real difficulties.

  [Excerpts] With the end of apartheid, the countries which 
surround South Africa are beginning to think about an African 
economic commonwealth. Almost all belong to the British 
Commonwealth. Mozambique is one such country, and its status as 
observer has led many economists and intellectuals to say that 
Mozambique should adopt the English language. 
  However, speaking to RDP1 this morning, President Joaquim 
Chissano said Mozambique will keep Portuguese as its official 
language and will not seek membership in the Commonwealth. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Will 
Mozambique seek full membership of the Commonwealth? 
  [Chissano] Mozambique has never asked to join the 
Commonwealth. Mozambique has always asked for support and has 
widened its range of countries for economic and other, 
diplomatic, cooperation. And so the Commonwealth decided at one 
point to invite us to attend its meetings as an observer. This 
was because our country is surrounded by Commonwealth countries 
and because we played a very important role in the independence 
struggle in Zimbabwe, South Africa-Namibia. We have always been 
considered an important country in these processes, and the 
Commonwealth wanted to benefit from our practice and from our 
experience. 
  But we have never asked to join the Commonwealth. Therefore 
I do not understand why there is concern in Portugal about 
whether we are members of the Commonwealth or not. 
  [Correspondent] But will you seek to join? 
  [Chissano] We will not ask to join. If we are invited to 
join, I also do not see it, even though today the Commonwealth 
does not mean being a member of Great Britain or paying [word 
indistinct] to Great Britain. It is an organization like the 
Islamic Conference or other conferences where countries are 
welcome; it is an international organization which today is not 
based on whether a country speaks English or not. At the moment 
is it the English- speaking countries. [passage indistinct] [end 
recording] 
  That was President Chissano speaking on the first day of the 
registration of voters in Mozambique. He was speaking about the 
future of Mozambique and its language, and its relations with 
the Commonwealth. We apologize for the sound quality of the 
recording.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Electoral Administration 
Technical Secretariat in Zambezia says that after the chairman 
of the Zambezia Provincial Elections Commission got his voter 
card this morning, its technical team -- made up of delegates of 
the Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, the Mozambican 
Nationalist Movement, a representative of the town council, 
Catholic Bishop Dom Bernardo, and a government official -- flew 
urgently to Gile District. This happened because the Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] delegate in that district burned 
one of the electoral registration posts in the capital of Gile 
and afterwards, with a group of people, attempted to destroy the 
District Elections Commission office. Having been immediately 
detained by the Police of the Republic of Mozambique Command, 
the delegate of Renamo in Gile District said he was following 
orders from his superiors since Renamo does not recognize the 
electoral organs.

  [Text] Washington June 1 SAPA -- Declaring South Africa is 
back not only as a world market but also as a prospective 
exporter, Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel on Wednesday 
[1 June] announced plans for South Africa's largest ever trade 
initiative with the United States. The multi-million dollar 
programme focusses on a South African industrial trade expo in 
New York City from September 20 to 23 where about 150 South 
African firms are expected to show their goods and services. 
"South Africa and the USA: Strengthening the Link", the expo is 
being staged by the Department of Trade and Industry and the 
South African Foreign Trade Organization (SAFTO). 
  Addressing a news conference in Washington, Mr Manuel said 
the idea was to reintroduce South Africa--not as an emerging 
market but as a emerging market with a highly sophisticated 
physical and financial infrastructure. He said President 
Mandela had set out a vision of South Africa's future based on 
compromise, peace and stability. Now the "battle royal" was on 
to give hard-won democracy some content. "Now we have to ensure 
that markets in South Africa are sharpened so that we can create 
jobs and improve on our manufacturing, that we can move up the 
value chain from our rich mineral endowment and re-position 
South Africa in the global economy." 
  Mr Manuel said South Africa's return to the Commonwealth, 
while unlikely to make a significant difference in the narrow 
sense of trade and economic terms, was part of the approach that 
South Africa was back in the family. 
  Referring to government's Reconstruction and Development 
Programme, he said South Africa had an enormous capacity to 
build a consensus society in the context of partnership and 
cooperation. This was the case between not only government and 
business but also South Africa and its major trading partners. 
  A series of initiatives being worked about between the 
United 
States and South Africa would be announced in a few weeks, he 
disclosed. 
  Mr Manuel said the development of southern Africa regional 
trade and stability was an important element in South Africa's 
drive into world markets. It was important for South Africa to 
stimulate economic development across the region with its 
100-million inhabitants. "Any notion that you build an island 
of prosperity in a sea ravaged by war is clearly a non-starter," 
he said. 
  South African Ambassador Harry Schwarz told the news 
conference that trade was like a tango -- and it took two to 
tango. With respect to the US and South Africa, one tango 
dancer was a powerful economy and the other was a fast-improving 
existing market. South Africans of all races were a proud 
people, Schwarz said. "We are not standing with a begging 
bowl....We stand as a proud people wanting to build an economy 
and saying that we have tremendous resources and the capacity to 
become a major world power."

  [Text] The entire negotiations process that led to the 
transfer of power to the South African Communist Party has been 
directed by the Americans. American Ambassador Princeton Lyman 
tried -- up to the very last moment -- to remove obstacles from 
the negotiations and transfer of power. Whenever stumbling 
blocks were encountered in talks between the National Party [NP] 
and the ANC; between the NP, ANC, and the Freedom Front [FF]; or 
between the Freedom Front and the ANC, he intervened personally. 
  The agreement reached in the middle of December between 
General Viljoen, Roelf Meyer, and Thabo Mbeki regarding the 
Freedom Front Council [as received] could just not get signed. 
Gen. Viljoen asked the ANC, and then the NP, when it could be 
signed, but Roelf Meyer and Thabo Mbeki always had excuses. The 
one would suit Mbeki and not Meyer, and the next Meyer and not 
Mbeki. This had obviously been arranged. 
  Eventually Gen. Viljoen contacted Lyman to ask whether the 
ambassador couldn't do anything to save the agreement on which 
so much -- for America as well -- depended. The day was 
Wednesday, 22 April. 
  Within an hour both Meyer and Mbeki's secretaries rang Gen. 
Viljoen to inform him that the agreement could be signed the 
next morning. And so it happened. 
  From this small event four things can be deduced, observers 
say. 
  First: It is not a good omen for Gen. Viljoen ever getting 
his Homeland Council implemented. Mandela and a half a dozen of 
his assistants have often and categorically said there was no 
chance whatsoever that the ANC would cooperate to bring about an 
Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. What they have said about a 
volkstaat has to be taken at face value. "Over my dead body," 
were Mandela's words on more than one occasion. The NP, from De 
Klerk to Tertius Delport, has also expressed similar sentiments. 
  Second: It proves how significant the agreement on 23 April 
is regarding America's plans. Volkstaat or no volkstaat, the 
maximum of Afrikaner voters had to be drawn into the election. 
  Third: It proves how healthy the relationship between Lyman 
and Gen. Viljoen is. 
  Fourth: It shows how the negotiations process was directly 
handled and directed by Lyman. Just one word from him, and both 
Mbeki and Meyer obey at once.

  [Text] Pretoria May 31 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on 
Tuesday [31 May] said South Africa was looking forward to making 
a positive contribution to the Commonwealth, on hearing of the 
country's readmission on June 1. "The assumption of Commonwealth 
membership on the part of a democratic South Africa is both a 
tribute to the momentous changes that have taken place in our 
country as well as a challenge for South Africa to play its part 
in the worldwide quest for a peaceful, harmonious and caring 
world." 
  The people of South Africa were indebted to the Commonwealth 
contribution made to bring about a democratic South Africa, he 
added.

  [Text] Pretoria June 1 SAPA -- The South African Police 
Union [SAPU] which claims to have more than 30,000 members 
countrywide on Wednesday [1 June] demanded the immediate 
reversal of a decision by the medical aid schemes Polmed and 
Medihelp to reduce benefits for employees of the the South 
African Police Service [SAPS]. SAPU said in statement the 
unilateral decision followed media statements by minister of 
safety and security Mr Sydney Mufamadi that he would meet police 
unions to thrash out issues of salaries and benefits. The union 
criticised the medical aid schemes' decision as "arrogance of 
the worst kind". 
  According to SAPU it would embark on action which would have 
a serious effect on the medical aid schemes should the decision 
not be reversed. The reduction of benefits was "a slap in the 
face of SAPS employees" who were already financially 
disadvantaged. The statement said SAPU had already entered 
negotiations with other employee organisations, medical 
professionals and the SAPS on the issue.

<F P=106> [By Tim Cohen] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town -- Provincial Affairs officials expect 
that it will take up to a year before provincial governments 
pass their first budgets. Department sources said the long 
delay in the establishment of functioning provincial governments 
was inevitable considering the need to amalgamate some regional 
authorities and to split others. 
  The comments came as ANC local government negotiator 
Thozamile Botha was on Monday [30 May] appointed chairman of the 
commission on provincial government by Provincial Affairs and 
Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer. SAPA [South 
Africa Press Agency] reports he will be assisted by former MEC 
[Member Executive Council] and NP [National Party] member Tjol 
Lategan. 
  The commission is to facilitate the establishment of 
provincial governments and advise the Constitutional Assembly on 
developing provincial constitutions. Other members are R. 
Jager, P. Lephunya, T.R. Benecke-Jordaan, P. Daphen, N.N. 
Gwagwa, D.E.T. le Roux, J. Malatji, Y. Muthien, Z. Titus, T. 
Tlhacoane, J.W.A. van der Merwe, V. Vedlanker and M. Webber. 
Only Botha and Lategan will serve in full-time capacities. 
  The departmental sources said although "those in the know" 
realised it would take time before provincial governments were 
up and running, the extent of the difficulties involved was not 
foreseen. The holding of provincial and national elections 
simultaneously was a "political decision" which did not take 
into account the likelihood that the provincial administrations 
would take time to be established. 
  However, representatives of provincial governments have 
since 
expressed frustration at the time it will take before they will 
be able to exercise their powers, but national government 
representatives say the delay is unavoidable. 
  Meanwhile, regional bureaucracies will be required to 
continue delivering their existing services, as stipulated by 
the constitution. 
  During the interim period, provincial governments will not 
be 
able to change existing structures without the backing of the 
national government. Pivotal in the process will be the 
establishment of the financial and fiscal commission, which will 
recommend the division of tax income between the national and 
provincial governments. 
  The constitution states that provinces may levy taxes -- but 
only after they are authorised to do so by an Act of Parliament. 
The provinces will be entitled to "an equitable share" of 
national revenue once Parliament has fixed these amounts. 
  The allocation of national tax revenue will be made after 
the 
national interest and the recommendations of the financial and 
fiscal commission have been taken into account, the constitution 
states.

  [Text] Pretoria June 1 SAPA -- The National Peacekeeping 
Force [NPKF] would be disbanded on Thursday [2 June], Defence 
Minister Joe Modise said in a statement in Pretoria on 
Wednesday. Mr Modise said the constituent forces would be 
returned to their home units in preparation for the integration 
of all the forces into the South African National Defence Force 
[SANDF]. 
  He said he was following a recommendation by the National 
Peacekeeping Force Command Council, which was endorsed by the 
Transitional Executive Council's sub-council on defence. 
  SANDF Chief Gen Georg Meiring would oversee the 
demobilisation, Mr Modise said. 
  A passing out parade was being held for NPKF members at the 
force's Koeberg Base in the Cape, a source at the NPKF said. 
Force members would also be given certificates of commendation. 
It was not known whether a similar parade was being held at the 
NPKF's De Brug base at Bloemfontein. 
  The NPKF was formed in February to help keep peace during 
the 
April elections. After its first outing on the East Rand, 
however, the NPKF was withdrawn to base and not used again. 
  It is understood that about 1,200 NPKF members who came from 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], the armed wing of the 
African National Congress, would go to the Wallmannstal assembly 
point north of Pretoria for incorporation into the new National 
Defence Force. 
  About 2,800 members from the Transkei, Ciskei and Venda 
Defence Forces will return to their forces of origin until such 
time as those forces are incorporated into the SANDF. 
  It was not known what would become of the NPKF's commander, 
Gen Gabriel Ramushwana, formerly head of state and armed forces 
commander in Venda.

  [Text] Pretoria June 2 SAPA -- The South African National 
Defence Force [SANDF] is planning a service brigade to assist 
the government's Reconstruction and Development programme, 
newly-appointed SANDF chief Gen Georg Meiring said on Thursday 
[2 June]. He was addressing a press conference at Defence Force 
headquarters in Pretoria. 
  Outlining his vision of a Defence Force "out of the people 
and for the people" Gen Meiring said recruits who did not make 
the grade for admission into the Defence Force proper could 
become members of the service brigade. They would acquire 
skills in areas such as building houses and digging trenches as 
part of the Defence Force's contribution to the Reconstruction 
and Development Programme. 
  Gen Meiring said that in the past the Defence Force had 
helped with drought relief and civil construction projects in 
townships. He foresaw a similar role for the service brigade. 
  Replying to questions, Gen Meiring said the process of 
integrating statutory and non-statutory armed forces into a 
single Defence Force would take about three years. 
  He outlined a "colour blind" Defence Force in which the best 
person for the job would get the job, regardless of his or her 
colour. He said positions from the rank of lieutenant-general 
upwards were filled by decision of the cabinet and he hoped 
political pressure would not be brought to bear on these 
appointments. 
  Over the next three years there would be bridging courses 
for 
soldiers with a background in non-statutory forces such as the 
African National Congress' armed wing Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear 
of the Nation], but these would not qualify them to hold high 
rank in the SANDF. He said the SANDF would grow by about 30,000 
members as personnel from other forces were taken in. Over a 
three-year period, however, it would be trimmed back to the size 
it is now. 
  About 10,000 volunteers would be drafted in 1995. 
  He said the defence budget had been scaled back by 47 per 
cent since 1989 and had reached a point when it was not feasible 
to cut it further. In fact, the defence budget would increase. 
  He did not see the SANDF playing a major role in African 
peace- keeping efforts at this stage. Its first priority was 
towards South Africa and its next priority was to work in 
conjunction with the states of southern Africa. 
  On the integration of members of the Azanian Peoples 
Liberation Army [APLA], Gen Meiring said no APLA members' names 
appeared on the list agreed to in the constitution for inclusion 
in the SANDF. However, APLA members could be accepted in their 
individual capacities. They were not automatically members of 
the SANDF. 
  He said the SANDF would continue with internal policing in 
support of the South African Police Service. But this was not a 
role it chose for itself and he hoped the political situation 
had changed in such a way that the SANDF's presence on the East 
Rand would not be necessary for much longer. 
  He said Defence Minister Joe Modise had a working team 
studying the implications of a civilian ministry of defence.

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Chris Whitfield] </F>
  [Text] Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus -- sentenced to 
death for the assassination of SA Communist Party chief Chris 
Hani -- are unlikely to qualify for amnesty in terms of new 
legislation being drafted. 
  Justice Minister Dullah Omar told THE STAR yesterday: "I 
don't think it should be assumed that the definition (of 
politically motivated crimes) will cover them." 
  Justice Ministry sources indicated that the new amnesty 
legislation should be put before Parliament when it begins 
sitting again on June 20. 
  In terms of the Interim Constitution, the cut-off date for 
legislation which will free those convicted of or being 
responsible for politically motivated crimes should be December 
6 1993. It is understood midnight on December 5 has been 
pencilled into the legislation being prepared. 
  Although Hani was assassinated on April 10 last year, Omar's 
comments appear to confirm that the definition of a "politically 
motivated crime" will be drafted in such a way that Derby-Lewis 
and Walus will not qualify. 
  There was no indication whether it will include others 
involved in notorious cases such as the killing of Amy Biehl and 
those responsible for various massacres -- such as Boipatong, 
Bisho and the St James Church slaughters -- before December 5. 
  This week there were indications after talks between 
President Mandela and CP [Conservative Party] leader Dr Ferdi 
Hartzenberg that the right wing could benefit from amnesty for 
politically related crimes. 
  It was not clear whether this would include the 32 men who 
allegedly carried out a spate of pre-election bomb attacks as 
this would require a change to the Interim Constitution by 
extending the cut-off date, which appears unlikely. 
  After meeting Hartzenberg on Monday, Mandela said the 
Government would apply the same criteria for amnesty to 
rightwingers who committed offences of a political nature 
between October 8 1990 -- the cut-off date in existing 
legislation -- and December 5 last year. Hartzenberg and Omar 
are to hold talks on the amnesty issue. 
  Deputy President de Klerk had allegedly seen the draft 
legislation and approved it.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Back in Commonwealth -- "It is one of history's little 
ironies that those most vocal in bewailing South Africa's 
departure from the Commonwealth in 1961 are now most lukewarm 
about our readmission," notes an editorial in Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 2 June on page 16. "`Club' membership no 
longer brings unquestioned economic benefits in terms of 
preferential tariffs and increased trade. But is does offer 
assistance in education and literacy, technical training, health 
programmes, scientific conferences and other areas where years 
of enforced isolation from the world have left us lagging well 
behind other countries of comparable size and influence." "As 
long as the costs of membership do not substantially outweigh 
the benefits, South Africa will be better off as a member of the 
Commonwealth than as an `old boy' looking on from the sidelines." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Looming Bank Legislation -- "Apprehension over looming 
legislation to compel banks to detail publicly information on 
lending by race and by sex is understandable," states an 
editorial in the 2 June BUSINESS DAY in English. "Apart from 
the obvious difficulties of compiling the information" there 
would "also be the bureaucratic cost of complying with yet 
another layer of regulation." Against the bank's "understandable 
fear" of being "legally or morally coerced into making riskier 
loans," is the counter of of using "openness" as a "potent 
marketing tool" to "differentiate banks from each other and help 
in their efforts to attract and keep business." "The banks have 
to accept that they are operating in a new environment. By the 
same token, the ANC's advisers must be realistic and not seek to 
introduce commercially unsound change." 
  New World -- "South Africa is tumbling with gusto into every 
possible international forum that once rejected us: the 
Commonwealth, the Organisation of African Unity, the Non-Aligned 
Movement, the International Labour Organisation, and of course, 
we will soon be back in the Un General Assembly." "It is not 
clear that the Non-Aligned Movement has any further role in what 
has been for years a unipolar world" and Commonwealth membership 
"will not deliver much of measurable significance," the second 
editorial in the 2 June BUSINESS DAY notes. "More important are 
our international trade relations, and they are helped by our 
new membership of international forums." "After the `welcome 
back' fanfare, government and the private sector will have to 
work at enhancing the relationships that count." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Back in Commonwealth -- "Getting back into the Commonwealth 
is important but is mainly a sentimental and psychological boost 
for South Africa, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 2 June on page 8. The Commonwealth nations are mainly 
poor and there is not much to gain economically." Going from 
"pariah state" exclusion affected not only "intellectual, 
cultural and economic stimulation, but our confidence." And 
being back in the Commonwealth "also means we will compete again 
in the Commonwealth games." 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Return to International Bodies -- "Resuming our Commonwealth 
membership is another major step in the normalisation of our 
relations with the outside world," states an editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 1 June on page 6. South 
Africa also became a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, the 
Orgainzation of African Unity and will take its seat in the 
United Nations. "When that happens, we will be back in all 
international bodies from which we were excluded by apartheid, 
and we will be able to hold our heads high once more in the 
community of nations."

  [Text] ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is warning that its patience and 
calmness should not be misinterpreted as weakness. ECOMOG is 
reminding the factions that Article 8 of the Cotonou Accord 
allows ECOMOG the right of self-defense but it does not wish to 
be compelled to implement this section of the accord. 
  According to a release issued last night, ECOMOG noted that 
the practice whereby all the factions abduct ECOMOG soldiers at 
will must stop. The release noted that while ECOMOG's neutral 
position in this crisis is unquestionable and so far as ECOMOG 
will not [words indistinct] helplessly while its men and 
material are being maltreated and vandalized, ECOMOG says its 
patience should not be misinterpreted as a weakness. 
  The release continued that about two weeks ago, nine ECOMOG 
soldiers belonging to the Ugandan contingent were abducted by 
the LPC [Liberian Peace Council] for no reason whatsoever and 
kept in captivity for about three days. Also, another soldier 
was kidnapped by the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
early this year and is yet to be released. Similarly, five 
ECOMOG soldiers are still being held by ULIMO fighters. 
  ECOMOG wishes to reassure the people of Liberia and the 
international community that ECOMOG is religiously committed to 
the principle and spirit of the Cotonou Accord. ECOMOG says 
this commitment is evidenced by the way ECOMOG troops have 
continued to remain calm in the face of extremely reckless 
provocations. 
  Meanwhile, the West African peacekeeping force has described 
as baseless and false allegations being made by the warring 
factions in the Liberian crisis against ECOMOG. ECOMOG says 
these allegations are only intended to discredit ECOMOG and its 
invaluable role and responsibility as a neutral peacekeeping 
force. 
  In a statement issued last night, ECOMOG said while these 
allegations would not have required any rebuttal, it is 
necessary to stop [words indistinct]. In the statement, ECOMOG 
said in March this year, ECOMOG, in collaboration with UNOMIL 
[UN Observer Mission in Liberia], initiated a cease-fire 
negotiation between the NPFL and LPC but to their disappointment 
both sides proved not to be honest and serious about achieving 
peace. On two occasions, ECOMOG and UN joint reconnaissance 
missions to ascertain the disposition of the opposing forces 
were frustrated by the NPFL. On its part, the LPC has refused 
to cease hostilities so that ECOMOG can deploy its troops. 
ECOMOG says it is preposterous, therefore, for the NPFL and LPC 
to turn around after all these efforts to cast aspersions as to 
ECOMOG's neutrality. 
  On the ULIMO issue, ECOMOG noted that in March, April, and 
May this year, series of reconciliatory meetings were held, all 
initiated by ECOMOG at the ECOMOG headquarters with UNOMIL 
officials in attendance to resolve the rift between Alhaji 
Koromah and Roosevelt Johnson to enable the peace process move 
forward. The cease-fire agreements reached at these meetings 
were not respected by either party. Still in an attempt to 
curtail the mayhem in Tubmanburg, Bong mines, and Bo, ECOMOG 
deployed troops to these areas as a confidence-building measure 
and to deter the fighters of the two factions from further 
carnage. The release said in spite of all these, the fighting 
persisted, thereby endangering the lives of ECOMOG officers and 
men as well as material deployed to these areas. 
  The release concluded that since ECOMOG is a neutral 
multinational force whose mandate is to ensure that peace 
returns to Liberia, it did all that was humanly possible short 
of combat action to stop the carnage without success.

  [Text] Pretoria June 1 SAPA -- South Africa will provide 
humanitarian assistance to Rwanda, which is engulfed by 
internecine strife, following an urgent appeal from the United 
Nations. In a statement on Wednesday [1 June] night, a 
spokesman for the president's office, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, said 
the decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. He 
said further details would be released after consultations with 
the UN about the role South Africa could play to help 
international efforts to end the conflict in Rwanda. 
  Another decision was taken to dedicate June 16, the 
anniversary of the Soweto pupil uprising, to the promotion of 
the culture of learning and teaching. President Nelson Mandela 
would attend an event in Soweto to launch the campaign. 
  The statement said Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, together 
with US Vice President Al Gore, would open a major conference in 
Atlanta, Georgia at the weekend aimed at exploring ways in which 
American investors and other institutions could assist South 
Africa's Reconstruction and Development Programme. US Secretary 
of Commerce Ron Brown and various American corporate, foundation 
and other government leaders would participate in the conference. 
  Details on other decisions of cabinet would be announced by 
the relevant ministries in due course, the statement said.

  [Text] Harare June 1 SAPA -- Fourteen African presidents, 
including Mr Nelson Mandela on his first trip outside South 
Africa as president, have begun gathering in Harare, Zimbabwe, 
for a two-day meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa [GCA], 
an international lobby for support for the continent. The 
meeting starts on Thursday [2 June]. 
  On Friday, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will host what 
is expected to be the final meeting of the Frontline states, the 
regional alliance of southern African nations which opposed 
apartheid. Officials said leaders of the seven-nation grouping 
would discuss a new organisation to replace it. 
  Already in Harare is Benin leader Nicephore Soglo who hosted 
the previous GCA meeting in June last year. Due to arrive on 
Wednesday are the heads of state of Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, 
Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Ivory Coast 
and Botswana, and former World Bank head Robert MacNamara and 
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. 
  Founded with World Bank finance and based in Washington, the 
GCA was established as an alliance of African nations and 
Western donor nations with close ties to the continent. It was 
part of a bid to counter a shift of Western financial support 
from Africa after the fall of the Communist bloc. Backers 
describe it as dedicated to "keeping alive the good news in 
Africa". 
  Frontline heads of state are expected to support moves to 
keep the body alive in spite of the transition to democracy in 
South Africa. However, the group is expected to change its 
"confrontational" name and adopt a new direction, working for 
peace and political stability in the region and to provide a 
forum for conflict mediation.

  [Text] President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has outlined a 
new vision for Africa in which the continent will no longer be 
synonymous with economic mismanagement, civil strife, or human 
rights abuses, nor with poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease. 
Opening a meeting of African presidents and representatives of 
Western donor nations in Harare, he said that perhaps at no 
other time in Africa's history had the continent felt so acutely 
the need for partnership and a genuine friendship than today. 
Africa was an essential component of global policy, he said. 
The failure or success of Africa affected the rest of the world. 
  President Mugabe said Africa was embarking on a program of 
economic structural adjustment, political reforms and regional 
integration. Good governance had been accepted as vital 
throughout Africa as democracy could not be complete without it. 
He said those African countries that had demonstrated 
seriousness about their political and economic reforms deserved 
support and cooperation more than ever before.

  [Text] Harare June 2 SAPA -- Africa is likely to remain 
mired in poverty unless the AIDS scourge is arrested through the 
commitment of more resources, the Global Coalition for Africa 
(GCA) said in Zimbabwe on Thursday [2 June]. According to the 
GCA's African Population Advisory Committee (APAC) report 
presented in Harare, nine million adults in Africa were infected 
with the HIV virus. 
  The report was presented by prof H Okoth-Ogendo on behalf of 
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, the current APAC chairman, 
the ZIANA news agency reported. 
  The session was also attended by Zimbabwean President Robert 
Mugabe, Botswana's President Kethumile Masire and other 
dignitaries. 
  The report said many African countries, including Zimbabwe, 
had the highest HIV prevalance among adults worldwide. 
  AIDS was also increasing health care costs while orphaning 
large numbers of children and leaving many elderly people 
without protection. 
  The report said advances made in health and welfare were 
being eroded by AIDS and it quoted United Nations Children's 
Emergency Fund estimates as showing that under-five mortality 
rates were likely to be pushed back to the 1960s level. 
  "In summary, the epidemic will likely increase the number of 
people in poverty and thwart efforts to develop sectors that 
rely on skilled or scarce manpower." 
  The report noted African efforts to contain the virus had 
had 
mixed results. Zimbabwe, along with six other African countries, 
had been successful in changing behaviour through use of condoms. 
  APAC recommended focusing prevention programmes on the 
youth, 
making condoms easily available and improving management 
programmes to control the AIDS epidemic.

  [Text] South Africa's future role in the southern African 
community is one of the major topics being discussed at meetings 
of the Global Coalition for Africa and the Frontline states in 
Harare today and tomorrow. President Mandela is representing 
South Africa officially for the first time at both meetings. 
Estelle Pienaar filed this report: 
  [Begin Pienaar recording] Key developmental issues for 
Africa, and in particular southern Africa, tops the agenda in 
Harare. The Zimbabwean capital today played host to the meeting 
of the Global Coalition for Africa and will tomorrow be the 
venue for the meeting of the Frontline states. The body was 
founded as a front of neighboring countries against South 
Africa. Now that South Africa has shed its apartheid burden, 
and is back with a vengeance in the international community and 
the brotherhood of African countries, the organization has lost 
the very reason for its existence. 
  However, it's believed that Zimbabwe is keen to see the 
establishment of a new organization to replace the Frontline 
states. But other parties feel that such a body would have 
little value as most of the issues affecting southern African 
countries could be dealt with by the Southern African 
Development Community, SADC. Zimbabwean newspapers report that 
the name Frontline States is expected to be dropped in 
preference for something that sounds less confrontational. 
Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, the future of 
southern Africa will hopefully never be as divided as its past. 
  In recent years the world has increasingly turned its back 
on 
Africa. Any organization which unites South Africa with the 
rest of the sub-continent in the interest of regional peace, 
stability and economic growth, might just provide the impetus to 
prove that this region can survive, and indeed prosper. [end

  [Text] Botswana President Sir Ketumile Masire has appealed 
to international donor agencies and financial institutions not 
to abandon assistance to African countries in favor of Eastern 
Europe. [Words indistinct] in Harare for the Frontline States' 
meeting tomorrow, he said African countries which have now 
endorsed democracy need the financial support of the 
international community. He urged African leaders to acknowledge 
their failures in the past which, he said, had led to the 
current economic problems of African countries.

  [Excerpt] A meeting of the advisory board of the 
North-South Forum on African continent is being held in Harare, 
Zimbabwe. On one side are the African leaders; on the other are 
the donor countries, and between them a climate of 
Afro-pessimism reigns. The international powers are becoming 
increasingly tired of the conflicts on the African continent and 
the aid is changing direction, namely it is being directed 
toward east European countries. This was confirmed by Briosa e 
Gala, Portuguese secretary of state for foreign affairs, who is 
representing our government at the meeting. 
  [Begin Briosa e Gala recording] Today, an Afro-pessimism is 
gradually growing about the state of Africa's development on the 
part of many European countries and of the United States. 
Unfortunately, Africa now represents only 1 percent of world 
trade, it continues to be affected by violent and cruel wars, 
and all this creates a certain fatigue in the international 
community, which in many cases prefers to support other areas, 
for example eastern Europe. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Harare June 2 SAPA -- Sub-Saharan Africa should 
reduce its dependence on foreign assistance as it has exhausted 
its capacity to borrow external funds, the Global Coalition for 
Africa [GCA] says in its annual report. "Sub-Saharan Africa has 
low savings, low investment, falling per capita GDP and relies 
heavily on foreign resources. This must change. The region has 
exhausted its capacity to borrow external funds on market terms. 
And concessional aid, already down from its peak, may fall even 
more i? the years ahead," the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana quoted 
the GCA's 1993 report as saying. 
  Armed conflict had stifled development, drained resources 
and 
impoverished many African countries, the GCA said. Even after 
conflicts ended many countries had to undertake massive 
reconstruction programmes to repatriate refugees, resettle 
displaced persons and demobilise and re-integrate combatants. 
"The estimated 5.4 million refugees in Africa are evidence of 
the suffering. Unable to lead reproductive lives in their own 
countries, they burden host governments and the international 
community." 
  GCA executive director Boubakar Daiby-Outtara emphasised the 
need for Africa to mobilise its own resources to compliment 
those received from abroad. "African countries should clearly 
see the need to take charge of their own priorities."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ble Guirao, deputy secretary general of the </F>
Federation of University and High School Students of Cote 
d'Ivoire, by correspondent Cendres Glazai; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Glazai] In which conditions 
were you detained? 
  [Guirao] We spent very very harsh moments in detention. Our 
comrades who were detained at the police academy turned out to 
be "guinea-pigs" for the police trainees who flogged them all 
the time. Some of them were even admitted in hospital, thus 
prompting the trainees to stop torturing them. I was personally 
subjected to special treatment for allegedly writing a letter to 
General Ouassenan Kone about the genocide of the Guebies. I was 
tortured day and night so that I would no longer feel like being 
an activist of the Federation of University and High School 
Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI]. We all fell so sick that the 
government was forced to buy up to 115,850 CFA francs worth of 
drugs to treat us. 
  [Glazai] Yet, you said in a statement on television that you 
were well treated. 
  [Guirao] Everyone knows that we performed a play in several 
acts, in which each of us had a carefully defined role. 
Minister Kone was the director and we were the forced actors. 
All this was to make us dismiss -- under Minister Kone's 
supervision -- the "allegations" made by LA VOIE about our 
detention conditions and to give an account that would be 
favorable to the government. We were also forced to apologize 
to our parents and to ask for the government's forgiveness. 
Minister Kone ordered me to read and sign the statement. He 
said he would reconsider the decision to release us if I dropped 
even one comma while reading the statement, so that is why I had 
my eyes riveted on the sheet of paper while reading. It was a 
true play in which I denied being a FESCI member whereas I 
remain the movement's second in command. 
  I conclude by saying that we were not well treated, the 
proof 
being that we were drugged. The government must stop those old 
methods which consist in forcing people to make statements. 
  [Glazai] Now that you are free, how do you feel? 
  [Guirao] I feel scared and disgusted. I think of the 
democrats who are targeted through our movement. It is time for 
the forces of change to wake up; our country is in danger. What 
we could see and hear at the police academy proves our thinking 
right and disturbs us. For example, Minister Kone said he is 
ready to repress and crush all those who break law and order 
which, according to him, means all those who make demands, stage 
marches, and so on... He intends to do this fully in the name of 
peace. 
  I would like to shout and say that my heart aches for Cote 
d'Ivoire. This is a country in which so-called legalists have 
come to power through the law but who persist in violating this 
same law. They violate the citizens' liberties with impunity. 
The people should not remain silent in the face of the regime's 
acts of aggression because democracy is actually at stake in our 
country. Ouassenan Kone has even stated that he is ready to 
stage a coup d'etat if the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire 
loses power through the ballot box in 1995. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bamako, 2 Jun (AFP) -- Four people were killed and 
17 others wounded yesterday in a Tuareg-led attack on the Malian 
locality of Fafa, near the Niger border, the MALIAN NEWS AGENCY 
reported today. A Tuareg military leader, "Captain" Abokar 
Sadek of the Islamic Arab Front of the Azaouad [FIAA], was 
killed in the attack that followed a clash with the Malian Army, 
the agency stated. 
  These incidents follow the signing of an agreement on 16 May 
between the Malian Government and the Unified Movements and 
Fronts of Azaouad [MFUA] which groups four major Tuareg 
movements, including the FIAA. The agreement provides for the 
integration of the MFUA combatants into the Malian Army and the 
dismantling of their bases in northern Mali.

  [Text] Our guest on Afrique Soir is Ag-Athom Ag Alhassane, 
one of the leaders of the Mali Tuareg movements. Recently there 
have been more clashes. Many civilians have been killed. Does 
this situation call the national peace pact into question? This 
is what Muriel Pomponne asked Ag-Athom Ag Alhassane. 
  [Begin recording] [Alhassane] This does not call the 
national 
pact into question, but it has to be recognized that the 
national pact has run into some difficulties since it was 
signed. These are inherent in the behavior of certain persons 
who can be found on each side, and who want to sabotage it. 
  [Pomponne] Can you, as a movement, affirm that you are not 
calling the national pact in question? 
  [Alhassane] As a movement we are indeed reaffirming our 
commitment to the national pact, and to its implementation. The 
Algiers meeting the other day is for us the consecration and the 
conclusion of important arrangements in the national pact. 
  Among the decisions taken, the most important is the 
integration of our fighters, and the dismantling of the bases, 
because once this second integration is implemented, the 
movement's bases will be dismantled and we will move toward the 
dissolution of the movements. 
  [Pomponne] There are no differences of opinion between you 
and the Malian government? 
  [Alhassane] At the moment there are no differences between 
us 
and the Malian government. 
  [Pomponne] There is talk at the moment of armed militia 
among 
the sedentary population. How do you explain the hostility of 
this population? 
  [Alhassane] Well, we don't know how to explain this 
hostility. These are militia who were in fact already organized 
in the form of self-defense brigades, and in some villages we 
had already seen people (?being killed) last year, and we had 
always closed our eyes to that. This has gone on until now, and 
it is going on, and we are trying as hard as we can to restrain 
ourselves and not to respond, because we think it is sort of 
provocation, and we know that it is not in fact the people who 
actually belong to the sedentary population who are behind this 
sort of action. 
  [Pomponne] Are you expecting the government to take any 
measures to put an end to this violence? 
  [Alhassane] Yes, we think the government is responsible for 
providing security for everyone, both the white population and 
the black population, and that is why the movement is going to 
try as hard as possible not to start fighting these militia, 
since we know, we think this is the state's business, and we are 
leaving the state the time to take the necessary measures. 
  [Pomponne] But you, the movements, are often accused of 
being 
the cause of the insecurity. How do you respond to these 
accusations? 
  [Alhassane] We cannot say that the movements do not bear a 
share of the responsibility for this insecurity. But what has 
to be recognized, and what people don't understand, is that 
there is the movement, and then there are other groups that are 
hard to keep under control, and who carry out this sort of deed. 
It is very difficult to see the officials of the movement, or 
the movement as such, carrying out this sort of deed. People 
must understand that when you have a rebel movement, or a 
problem that has gone on for some time, there are always 
remnants and you need time to bring them under control. That is 
what we are asking people to understand, and everyone must 
(?make an effort) to understand this. [end recording]

has stressed the need for the various Army units to keep an 
aggressive surveillance on the country's borders to forestall 
the breakdown of law and order. He gave the charge in Ibadan 
while declaring open a three-day training week for officers of 
the 2d Mechanized Division of the Nigerian Army. Correspondent 
Adenrele Ayishefini reports: 
  [Begin Ayishefini recording] The chief of Army staff, Maj. 
Gen. Chris Alli, spoke of the essence of basic training to 
members of the Armed Forces. According to him, training of Army 
is not only another means to create alertness for the nation's 
defense in times of crisis. It also provides a good foundation 
for professionalism in the Nigerian Army. Maj. Gen. Alli 
expressed concern on the issue of lost discipline within the 
rank and file of the Nigerian Army, such incidents as 
involvement of Army officers in robbery, smuggling, hiring (?or 
outright) sale of arms and ammunition, as well as extortion by 
those he described as shame to the military profession. 
  He said, henceforth, adequate disciplinary action will be 
taken against any Army officer who defaults in keeping the 
ethics of the profession. 
  The chief of Army staff made mention of the need for the 
various Army units to keep an aggressive surveillance on the 
country's borders to forestall the breakdown of law and order.

  [Text] Two hundred and sixty-five of the approved 273 
delegates to the Constitutional Conference have been cleared to 
represent their various districts at the conference which takes 
off late this month. Announcing the full results of last 
Saturday's [28 May] conference district election to choose 
delegates to the conference, the chairman of the committee, Mr. 
Bernard Mba, disclosed that elections did not hold in five 
constituencies in Ogun State and one each in Ondo, Kaduna, and 
Rivers States. He commended the conduct of the election, noting 
that the ward elections were devoid of hooliganism, (?thuggery), 
violence, and molestation, noting that there was also no room 
for money politics or sale of votes during the elections. 
  Among the notable politicians who were elected to the 
conference were Retired Major General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, 
Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, Chief Emeka Ojukwu, and 
Chief Stephen Lawani, the former deputy chairman of the defunct 
NRC [National Republican Convention. Others are Mr. Emmanuel 
Nsan, a former health minister, Professor Eric Ofia, Chief 
Edmond Udekwu, and retired Air Commodore Jonah David Jang, a 
former military governor of the former Gongola State. 
  Meanwhile, by-elections are to be conducted in some parts of 
the states where such elections were not held. By-elections 
will be held in Kaduna State on the 11th of this month, for

both ward and conference district [levels] will be held between 
11 and 13 June in Ogun and Ondo States.

  [Text] The agenda for the forthcoming constitutional 
conference was today in Abuja submitted to the Federal 
Government by the Constitutional Conference Commission [CCC]. 
State House correspondent, Ogboji Ogbonaya Ogi, reports that 
the agenda also contains a detailed timetable for the conference. 
  [Begin recording] [Ogi] Presenting the report to the head of 
state, General Sani Abacha, the chairman of the CCC, retired 
Justice (Sayibu Sayi), said the agenda was drawn on major issues 
and includes over 1,000 memoranda received from individuals and 
(?groups) from across the country. The memoranda, Justice 
(Sayi) explained, were collated and analyzed to formulate the 30 
items contained in the conference agenda. The chairman added 
that the agenda was designed to fit into the four-month duration 
of the conference under the first phase of the political program. 
  Receiving the agenda, Gen. Abacha commended the commitment 
of 
the commission in keeping faith with government's resolve and 
anxiety to ensure that the conference was a success. Gen. 
Abacha described the conduct of the last election of delegates 
for the conference as most encouraging and congratulated both 
the winners and losers for their maturity and spirit of 
sportsmanship. The head of state commented on the reactions of 
the international community on the outcome of the election, as 
well as his administration's determination to pursue its 
transition program to a successful conclusion. 
  [Abacha] (?On) the outcome of the delegates' election, the 
attention of government has been drawn to favorable comments by 
some foreign governments and media which now believe that this 
administration is sincere and fully committed to putting this 
country on a sound democratic footing. We appreciate this show 
of understanding. We however continue to solicit their 
cooperation in their reporting and commenting fairly and 
positively about our nation. They should also highly appreciate 
the enormity of our problems and give support to our courage and 
determination to grapple with them. Let me reiterate, 
unequivocally, that this administration will not renege on her 
stated objective. The administration [words indistinct] 
confidence placed on her to (?lead) our country [words 
indistinct]. The pursuit of a vibrant democracy for our people 
(?ignores) incoherent, emotional, and idle (?views) of 
self-seeking individuals. [passage indistinct] Make no mistake 
about it. 
  [Ogi] Gen. Abacha said that the resolve of the 
administration 
to return the country to democratic rule was total and will 
never succumb to what he described as the whims and caprices of 
a small minority. The CCC, inaugurated on 18 January, had 
earlier submitted an interim report on 9 March. With the 
submission of the agenda, the commission is now expected to 
commence preparations for the commencement of the conference on 
the 27th of this month. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the chief of general staff [CGS], Lieutenant 
General Oladipo Diya, has given the assurance that a decree to 
regulate the conference will be out before its commencement. He 
gave the assurance while speaking with State House 
correspondents shortly after the conference committee presented 
its agenda to government. State House correspondent Haruna 
Idriss has the details. 
  [Begin recording] [Idriss] The CGS said the decree, which 
was 
almost ready, will be released before the head of state 
inaugurates the conference. Gen. Diya stated that the content 
of the decree had already formed a part of the regulations 
governing the recent elections held into the conference. He 
assured Nigerians that the Federal Government would respect the 
agenda of this conference which, he said, was based on the 
memoranda collected from various parts of the country. The CGS 
said government was working on the composition of its nominees 
to the conference and gave the assurance that their names would 
soon be made public. On the problem of accommodation for the 
conference delegates, Gen. Diya said housing units earmarked for 
the delegates would be ready before the commencement date of the 
conference. 
  Also speaking to newsmen, the chairman of the Conference 
Publicity Committee, Dr. (Wesse Ofalago), announced that the 
committee, which submitted a 30-item agenda to government, will 
put in place adequate logistic arrangements for the conference 
to ensure hitch-free deliberations. Dr. (Ofalago) expressed 
appreciation to some foreign governments for the support 
extended to the committee. He announced that the British 
Government had shown confidence in the conference and undertaken 
to contribute funds towards the setting up of the conference 
library. The library, he said, would contain all the memoranda 
submitted to the committee, copies of previous constitutions, 
and other deliberations of the conference. [end recording]

  [Text] Dakar, 3 Jun (APS-SEN/PANA) -- Senegalese police 
used heavy equipment, including one armoured car, to disperse 
about a hundred protesters, including some students and several 
[words indistinct]. The protestors, whose demands were unclear, 
attacked official vehicles and public transport using stones. 
For several hours, they occupied the main roads leading to the 
Gueule Tapee Quarter, near central Dakar, burning tyres and 
attacking passing vehicles. Several traders in the area closed 
their shops fearing a possible onslaught. 
  The protestors, between 15 and 25, also set up barricades 
that blocked traffic. A handful of individuals claiming to 
belong to the student movement tried to obtain petrol. It was 
believed they wanted to use [it] to start a fire, from a nearby 
petrol station. Police intervened as they tried to force the 
station manager to give them the petrol.

  [Excerpts] The stealing of arms and ammunition at the 
National School of Noncommissioned Officers in Gamboma, Plateaux 
Region, on the night of 28 May continues to be the topic of 
discussion. The CONGOLESE NEWS AGENCY has published the full 
list of the stolen arms and ammunition which is read here by 
Jean-Jacques Adamou: 
  [Adamou] First, one should note that this is not the type of 
robbery that can be easily forgotten. It is a (?major robbery). 
According to the list released today, about 21,000 rounds of 
ammunition of various caliber, 120 rockets, 475 offensive and 
defensive grenades, 72 AK-rifles, 47 meters of explosive cord, 
256 safety fuses, one box of TNT, one box of dynamite, 19 
compasses, five aiming devices for RPG-7's, 13 TNT (?chains), 10 
antitank rocket launchers, and 18 rifles, were stolen. The 
large quantity of stolen weaponry gives rise to a myriad of 
questions. [passage omitted] One wonders whether the robbers 
did not benefit from complicity within the school. The least 
one can say is that security is very loose at the cadet school.

  [Text] A meeting between officers of Rwandan Patriotic Army 
[RPA] and Rwandan Government Forces [RGF] scheduled to take 
place today has begun at 1025 in Hotel Amohoro in Kigali. The 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] [as heard] delegation was headed 
by Colonel Frank Mugambage and that of government forces by Col. 
Marcel Gatsinzi. The meeting of RPA and RGF will be in camera. 
  The meeting for today will be a continuation of the Monday 
[30 May] meeting which was adjourned to resume today. In the 
Monday meeting, the delegation of RPF was also headed by Col. 
Frank Mugambage and that of government forces by Col. Gatsinzi. 
The purpose of these meetings of RPA soldiers and RGF soldiers 
is to negotiate so as to allow humanitarian assistance to reach 
civilians. 
  In the Monday meeting, RPF had presented a document 
containing conditions which will act as a prerequisite for any 
form of negotiation and, later on, a cease-fire: to stop 
massacres in government-controlled zones, that is the first 
point; two, the release of hostages trapped and caught up in the 
city center under the control of government soldiers; three, to 
ban any radio programs that incites execration [as heard] on 
Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines and Radio Kigali. 
The Monday meeting ended without agreement on any form of a 
peaceful settlement. However, they agreed to meet again today, 
Thursday. The first condition given by the RPF to stop the 
massacres by the government has not yet been adhered to, the 
recent example -- 500 people killed in Kabwai -- going without 
saying.

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, June 2 (AFP) -- Rwandan army and rebel 
commanders failed to agree on a ceasefire at United 
Nations-mediated truce talks Thursday [2 June] as the rebels 
pressed their offensive in the blood-drenched capital. 
  "We are capable of fighting this war and winning it if that 
is the option," Colonel Frank Mugambage of the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front (RPF) told reporters after the one-day talks 
broke up with an agreement to meet again at an unspecified date. 
  The mainly Tutsi RPF is demanding an end to massacres of 
Tutsis in territory held by the Hutu-led government. Up to half 
a million people have been hacked, bludgeoned, burned or 
machine-gunned to death since the April 6 death of president 
Juvenal Habyarimana in an alleged rocket attack on his plane 
pitched the small central African country into frenzied ethnic 
bloodletting. 
  Mugambage, the RPF's deputy commander, and Brigadier General 
Marcel Gatsinzi, the army's number two man, promised to 
cooperate with the UN in resuming the evacuation of civilians 
trapped behind battle lines, and distributing food to millions 
of Rwandans threatened by starvation. Evacuations were suspended 
Monday because of heavy fighting in Kigali and the failure of 
the two sides to guarantee security. 
  "The ceasefire was briefly addressed, but the evacuation of 
civilians and the safety of displaced persons was discussed at 
length," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said. "We 
have definitely made progress on the safety of our evacuation 
procedures and we plan to resume evacuations on Friday," he said. 
  Deputy UN force commander Brigadier Henry Anyidoho, who 
chaired talks between the two sides Monday and Thursday, said 
the main obstacles to agreement on a ceasefire were rebel 
demands for an end to massacres in government-held territory and 
an end to pro- government radio broadcasts inciting violence. 
  "Our aim was to go into ceasefire talks but then these 
obstacles came up," Anyidoho told a news conference after the 
talks ended. 
  Gatsinzi said he would convey the rebel conditions to the 
government. [passage omitted] 
  UN troops have rescued hundreds of Tutsis and Hutu 
opposition 
supporters stranded behind government lines in Kigali's Mille 
Collines hotel, and Hutus holed up in rebel territory in the 
Amahoro Stadium. 
  Kigali has become a ghost town as almost all its 500,000 
inhabitants have fled southwards in a perilous search for 
safety. The estimated 40,000 who remain rarely venture out into 
streets littered with spent shells. Dogs feed on dismembered 
bodies from recent massacres in some neighbourhoods. 
  The mainly Tutsi rebels have surrounded one of the army's 
last strongholds in the embattled capital, Camp Kigali, which 
they are shelling relentlessly. They are also closing in on the 
seat of the self-proclaimed all-Hutu interim government at 
Gitarama, 40 kiLometres (25 miles) southwest of the capital. 
  "The government has pulled most its big guns out of Kigali 
and put them in Gitarama," said a UN military observer who 
visited the town Wednesday. 
  With an estimated 20,000 fighters, the rebels are still 
heavily outnumbered by an army of well over 30,000 men despite a 
wave of desertions in the past two weeks. But the government's 
bedraggled, beer-swilling soldiers are demoralised and taking a 
pounding from rebel artillery, UN military sources said. 
  UN commander General Romeo Dallaire meanwhile expressed 
frustration that there was still no sign of a promised new 
5,500- strong UN force, leaving his 470 men powerless to end 
killings at a displaced people's camp at the southern monastery 
of Kabgayi. 
  A military reconnaissance team arrived here Thursday from 
Canada, which has pledged 300 soldiers, as Deputy Defence 
Minister Robert Fowler flew out after a two-day fact-finding 
visit.

  [Excerpts] Negotiations between the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] and the government forces resumed at Amahoro Hotel, Remera 
District in eastern Kigali yesterday. The negotiations were 
aimed at jointly assessing ways of reaching a cease-fire 
agreement so that relief operations can be carried out 
peacefully. The delegations from both sides left without 
reaching any agreement. 
  They discussed at length the conditions set by the RPF 
forces, conditions which are a prerequisite for the actual 
negotiations to start. [passage omitted]. 
  The government forces' delegation promised the RPF forces' 
delegation that they would address the demands of the RPF in 
order to correct misdeeds. The two delegations agreed that the 
UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] would meet both sides 
in order to fix another date for the resumption of negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, the two delegations agreed that UNAMIR's 
operation 
of taking civilians from the fighting areas to the sides of 
their choice would resume today. In this respect, the RPF 
forces' delegation announced in the meeting that the RPF had 
agreed that government forces could send envoys to Amahoro 
stadium, in the RPF- controlled area, to talk to people who have 
taken refuge there. 
  It is worth recalling that the people who took refuge at 
Amahoro stadium and whom the government claims belong to its 
side, have clearly stated that instead of going to die in areas 
still controlled by government forces where nobody cares, they 
have chosen to stay at Amahoro stadium. This means that they 
are not afraid of reports that those who go to the government 
side are shot by RPF forces, as the government forces' 
negotiator, Colonel Gatsinzi, said on Radio Rwanda this morning, 
to deceive the [word indistinct].

  [Excerpt] The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] today, at 1200 
entered the center of Kabgayi in Gitarama [as heard], after 
having chased away government troops who were dealing with the 
massacres of civilians. The Rwandan Patriotic Front combatants 
found in Kabgayi more than 20,000 people locked up in five camps 
where they had taken refuge following the massacres perpetrated 
by the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy 
and Development] militias. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Many more massacres of innocent civilians continue 
to be done behind government lines. Fleeing government soldiers 
and government-backed militias are continuously butchering 
innocent civilians. Mr. Edouard Karemera, first vice chairman 
of Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development 
and minister of internal affairs in the current Sindikubwabo 
so-called government, yesterday was blaming government soldiers 
who are revenging their massacred relatives by militias. He 
claimed that the government is not in control of militias. As 
minister of internal affairs, Karemera should be ashamed of this 
claim. Why doesn't he stop programs for the inciting of 
militias to kill civilians on radio RTLM [Radio-Television Libre 
des Milles Collines] and Radio Kigali? 
  Does he also claim not to be in control of the two radios? 
Mr. Karemera should not deceive himself. This genocide which 
he has helped in planning and executing, like those of his 
clique, will weigh heavily on him. It is not peace that the 
so-called government of Rwanda wants, but more time to massacre 
the remaining people. One wonders how the Rwanda Government 
forces are committed to peace while they continue to massacre 
civilians behind their lines.

  [Text] The international community, notably the United 
States, Canada, UNICEF, the Red Cross, and the Republic of South 
Africa [RSA] continues to show concern about the Rwandan drama. 
  The United States has just offered 50 vehicles, which will 
help in the evacuation operations of civilians still in the 
areas of fighting in Kigali, and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
once again discussed the Rwandan case during his discussions 
with Italian political leaders when he was visiting Rome 
recently. Canada is reportedly ready to provide 300 
telecommunications experts, and the Canadian defense minister is 
reported to have left for Rwanda to study the situation on the 
spot in order to better understand what there is to be done. 
  UNICEF has started sensitizing the international community 
to 
raise $5 million for the Rwandan victims. As for the RSA, it 
intends to collaborate with the United Nations in the framework 
of humanitarian assistance to the Rwandan population. The RSA 
recently stated it was not ready to dispatch an armed force to 
Rwanda. 
  While other peace-loving countries are coming to help 
Rwanda, 
it is deplorable that the Egyptian Government continues to help 
the Rwandan Government clique, which has plunged our country 
into a bloodbath. This Egyptian Government recently offered 
$750,000 for arms purchases to the Rwandan executioners.

  [Text] Jonas Savimbi's negotiators have already received 
the document containing the latest government offers to the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
UNITA negotiators received the document almost one week ago, 
but it has not yet been discussed. Our correspondent Manuel da 
Conceicao has further details. 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] UNITA says, however, that it 
only 
received the goverment's reply on its participation in the 
government on 31 May. The mediators say: That is not true. 
UNITA received the document on 28 May. 
  When Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN 
secretary general in Angola, left for Luanda on 29 May, they had 
already handed the document to UNITA. Sources close to Alioune 
Blondin Beye said the document was handed to the UNITA 
negotiating team a few hours after Beye received it from the 
special envoy of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on 28 May.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura today briefed 
the diplomatic corps accredited in Angola on the situation in 
the country. At the meeting, which took place behind closed 
doors, the Angolan foreign minister briefed the diplomatic corps 
on the development of the political and military situation in 
Angola and the peace talks in Lusaka. Venancio de Moura also 
examined the recent resolution of the UN Security Council on 
Angola. The minister said that following the approval of 
Resolution 992/94, it is hoped that UNITA will reconsider its 
stand and end the war once and for all. 
  [Begin Moura recording] It was not easy to make the UN 
Security Council adopt a satisfactory resolution on Angola under 
the present circumstances. Some circles even tried to hide the 
information on the best and final offer the Angolan Government 
made to UNITA, as its contribution to the search for and speedy 
conclusion of a general cease-fire and peace agreement in 
Angola. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The battles in Angola around the UNITA [National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebel headquarters 
at Huambo and the government-held towns of Malange and Cuito 
have been continuing. Aid flights have been interrupted and, 
according to government figures, the death toll at Cuito has 
reached 200, with 800 wounded, and the figure is expected to 
rise. It is ironic that the fresh eruption in the war comes at 
a time when the peace talks in Lusaka are apparently on the 
verge of a conclusion, with only the crossing of T's and the 
dotting of I's outstanding. On the line to Luanda, Akwe Amuso 
asked Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty why, in view of the 
progress in Lusaka, the fighting had eruped again. 
  [Begin recording] [Chikoty] We think that UNITA has been 
using constantly some kind of pressure on the military side. 
Maybe UNITA was expecting that the government might not make 
important concessions, as far as their participation is 
concerned in government. We have now made all the concessions, 
as far as their participation in government is concerned and so 
far there has been very little reaction on that. But on the 
other side, what we have felt is that there is intense fighting 
around Cuito. As I say, we have registered many deaths and we 
are going to register many more because they have been shelling 
the city of Cuito for the last five days, I think, and you can 
imagine that they are launching over Cuito as many as 500 bombs 
a day, and that is a lot. 
  [Amuso] UNITA, for its part of course, is accusing the 
government of having been largely responsible for escalating the 
situation. In fact, it is accusing the government of using 
chemical weapons in Cuito. 
  [Chikoty] No, first of all is that this is wrong. You cannot 
say that the government is responsible for the situation in 
Angola. UNITA has been fighting against the government after 
loosing the elections, taking over a number of places. The 
government has never been in an offensive position. The 
government has always been in a defensive position, as you may 
know. If UNITA wants, in fact, to end the crisis, they have to 
accept unconditionally the offer that the government has made: 
we stop everything, we sign a final cease- fire through the 
negotiations that are taking place in Lusaka. The problem is 
that there is constantly a tendency in some international media 
to give reason or to be promoting UNITA's cause. 
  [Amuso] But whether you or I like it or not, UNITA is in a 
position to go on prosecuting this war. Doesn't that mean that 
you are going to have to make more concessions in Lusaka? 
  [Chikoty] We have made last and final concessions. What we 
have given to UNITA so far is what is most acceptable to 
everyone. This offer was considered as extremely important, as 
we have gone beyond what the mediation has asked the government 
to do. We have offered everything that could be acceptable.

  [Text] Another 17 people died as a result of shelling by 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
against the city of Cuito this afternoon. Thus, a total of 301 
people have been killed and 614 wounded since Jonas Savimbi's 
organization resumed shelling the besieged city on 26 May. 
Hospital sources told our reporting team this afternoon that 
many wounded people could die in the coming hours because of 
lack of medical assistance and medicine. 
  Because of the intensity of shelling, the Doctors Without 
Borders from Belgium based in this city are unable to abandon 
their shelters to assist about 600 wounded people. Moreover, 
the Doctors Without Borders from Belgium and officials from the 
United Nations and other international humanitarian 
organizations are expected to be evacuated from the city any 
time from now. Arrangements are already under way.

  [Text] First to Malawi. Question: Can the new men in power 
in Malawi get their act together? They are in the news this 
morning and it seems the answer to that question is not yet. 
The United Democratic Front, the UDF, won the presidency 
outright in the recent elections, but not the parliamentary 
elections. So, they started talking to one of the smaller 
parties, Aford, the Alliance for Democracy, about the 
possibility of working together. Well, Aford's terms were that 
there should be a coalition government and that its party 
leader, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, should become a vice president. 
The talks have been going on since last week, but the news this 
morning is not good. The meeting has been called off, there is 
no agreement. On the line to Blantyre, David Stein asked the 
defense minister of the UDF government, Cassim Chilumpha, why 
the talks have broken down. 
  [Begin recording] [Chilumpha] We don't think that really we 
should be talking about a coalition government. What we should 
be talking about is Aford joining the government, just like the 
two other parties have. During those discussions we offered 
them three ministerial posts and we also said that we couldn't 
accept that Mr. Chakufwa Chihana should be vice president 
because constitutionally there can only be one vice president in 
the country and you can't have two vice presidents. That vice 
president has already been sworn-in anyway, so there is no post 
of vice president that Mr. Chihana can take up. So, we said, if 
that is the case, we didn't see the reason for continuing the 
talks, because we felt that there was no need for us to form a 
coalition government. All we could do was offer ministerial 
posts to Aford. 
  [Stein] As far as you are concerned then, have these talks 
effectively collapsed? 
  [Chilumpha] We didn't set another date for, you know, 
continuation of the talks, you know, as we see it, the door is 
still open for Aford to come and join us in government and that 
is where I understand we left off. 
  [Stein] Will you approach them again or will they have to 
come to you? 
  [Chilumpha] Well, that is a matter which, you know, we will 
have to examine as we go along, but as of now, our position is 
that really the ball is in the court of Aford. We have told 
them exactly what we can offer and we think that if they are 
serious in working with us, they should take us up on that offer. 
  [Stein] Are you prepared to compromise at all? I mean, after 
all, let us look at the role of Mr. Chihana, a very experienced 
politician who, some would say, would be an asset to your 
cabinet, and they say that they want him to be vice president. 
Would you consider offering him another key position? 
  [Chilumpha] I think that UDF made it very clear that if he 
wanted a ministerial post that could be given. 
  [Stein] But so far the posts you have offered are those of 
forestry and physical planning, and I don't think Mr. Chihana 
will probably think those were high profile enough. 
  [Chilumpha] Well, again, that is where the problem really 
lies. I think that if we are going to, you know, make headway in 
these, you know, talks, and in building a new Malawi, we should 
not come with preconceived ideas and conditions that demand. I 
think we should just come, you know, over to talk, you know. 
UDF has been all along saying that let us, you know, talk, it 
was Aford who snapped at us in December to say they couldn't 
work with us, because they called us all sorts of names -- 
rapists, murderers, and so on. All along, you know, we have kept 
the door open to them, saying that we should come and work 
together. We did work together during the referendum, but we 
have been snapped at all along and all we are doing now is to 
extend the same arm of friendship and cooperation to them and we 
think that it is high time that they should come over and join 
us. [end recording] 
  Well, let us hear from the other side now, Aford, the 
Alliance for Democracy. Their secretary general is (Meke 
Mtewa). On the line, David Stein asked Mr. (Mtewa) if his party 
would be prepared to continue negotiating with the ruling UDF. 
  [Begin recording] [(Mtewa)] Actually, I don't think it is us 
who have been approaching the party of the United Democratic 
Front. They have had the privilege and pleasure of approaching 
us in the past. If it is their intention to continue to talk 
about anything material including, of course, the maintenance of 
national unity, I am afraid, my party, the Alliance for 
Democracy, is interested in both issues, and would continue to 
talk with them for the duration and tenure of the government. 
  [Stein] Let's talk about the specific things that you are 
trying to achieve from these particular talks, which is, one, an 
indication that this government could be a coalition government 
and two, a key role for Mr. Chihana as vice president. They 
have said that neither of those are acceptable. Would you 
consider any kind of alliance with them on another basis? 
  [(Mtewa)] We have understood them not to prefer a coalition 
with us. They are only inviting us in a limited partnership and 
that is of a participatory nature. 
  [Stein] So, would you accept that limited partnership at 
all? 
  [(Mtewa)] That is for them to offer and for us to understand 
exactly in what scope, by that, of course a limited partnership 
would mean, if indeed that is the understanding and ours, that 
we will not be delivering to them our legislative and 
parliamentary group of members in parliament, except, of course 
to the extent, only to help and to aid them in administering 
those ministries which they feel we ought to be able to share in 
that limited sense. 
  [Stein] If we take Mr. Chihana, for example, they have 
already said that he can't be vice president because there is 
already a vice president. Now, why doesn't Mr. Chihana just 
accept the offer of one of those other cabinet positions? 
  [(Mtewa)] Mr. Chihana, of course, as president of the 
Alliance for Democracy has more pressing and binding 
responsibilities to lead the party, also the parliament, and to 
make sure that he organizes best and strengthens the foundations 
of this party for the next elections, including those of 
district and town council, and such other municipal elections 
forthcoming in this country. I cannot see him accepting any 
such role in the United Democratic Front government at this 
stage. 
  [Stein] Is it true that Aford has been holding meetings with 
the MCP [Malawi Congress Party] about the possibility of working 
together? 
  [(Mtetwa)] Purely as partners in the maintenance of this 
fragile democracy. Both the Malawi Congress Party and the 
Alliance for Democracy have, in the interest the maintenance and 
the safeguard and preservation of this [word indistinct] balance 
called the Malawi Democratic [word indistinct]. 
  [Stein] But, would you seriously consider working with the 
Malawi Congress Party against the UDF in parliament? 
  [(Mtetwa)] Not against the UDF in parliament. We will be 
working together in preservation of our democratic tradition as 
it is just beginning. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Some mystery is surrounding the negotiations that 
have been going on between Malawi's new UDF [United Democratic 
Front] government of President Bakili Muluzi and their allies in 
opposition, Aford [Alliance for Democracy], led by Chakufwa 
Chihana. Certainly, they were startling. Aford which gained 36 
seats against the UDF's 84, was apparently unhappy with the 
junior ministries it was offered. Yesterday, there were 
conflicting reports that the talks had broken down or were still 
on. There have also been suggestions that Aford is now talking 
to the former ruling party, Hastings Banda's MCP [Malawi 
Congress Party]. On the line to Blantyre, Mary Harper asked 
Nick Young of the London FINANCIAL TIMES exactly what the 
position was. 
  [Begin recording] [Young] Well, if I can begin by saying 
that 
at the moment, President Muluzi is out of the country. He left 
behind the secretary general of the party, Harry Thompson, to 
conduct the talks with Aford. I understand that they have 
stalled rather than broken down and I don't personally believe 
there will be any development until Muluzi returns to have a 
personal input into what is on offer. The position, as I 
understand it, is that the UDF government has offered Aford the 
possibility of having three seats in cabinet, fairly minor 
posts. I am told, I don't know if this correct, but I am told 
that offer has now been cut to three minor posts plus a couple 
of deputy ministries. Now, my personal belief is that Aford or 
the leadership of Aford is divided over whether or not to take 
these posts. 
  [Harper] So, does it really look like there is a serious 
split in Aford? 
  [Young] Yes, I think there could well be, not necessarily a 
split into two camps, perhaps a split into several. 
  [Harper] And what about Mr. Chihana himself? 
  [Young] Mr. Chihana is keeping a very low profile. He is 
operating in negotiations through junior colleagues and he is a 
lot of the time incommunicado. He has remained in the north 
since the election result. He is going around making a series 
of public speeches, which he is doing apparently to calm 
people's feelings down up there because there are a lot of 
reports of strong secessionist demands coming from ordinary 
people -- people saying let us just break away and form our own 
country. He has been going around saying: No, we must respect 
the election result and federalism or being a separate country 
just isn't viable for the north. 
  [Harper] Now, we have had reports that since the stalling of 
the talks between Aford and the government, Aford has now turned 
to the former ruling MCP Party. Do you know anything about this? 
  [Young] Well, I certainly believe that they are talking to 
each and I think that is natural and understable. Exactly how 
the new Parliament is going to shape up, it is very far from 
clear and at the very least, one would expect all the parties to 
be sounding each other out. [end recording]

  [Text] The British Government has assured the United 
Democratic Front [UDF] government of increased British economic 
and technical assistance as a way of helping it fulfill its 
programs of poverty alleviation and better economic management. 
The assurance was given in Blantyre today by the permanent 
secretary of the British Overseas Development Administration, 
Mr. (John Burke) when he held discussions with the vice 
president, the Right Honorable Justin Malewezi and the minister 
of finance, Hon. Aleke Banda. Speaking to MBC, Mr. (Burke) 
said his government was pleased with the peaceful transition in 
Malawi to a multiparty democracy and wishes to reaffirm its 
support for this country. Mr. (Burke), however, pointed out 
that further development aid will depend on the new government's 
determination to tighten controls in public spending, crack down 
on corruption, respect for human rights, liberalization of 
markets, and other initiatives which, he said, are crucial to 
all developing countries. 
  On his part, the vice president said the UDF government will 
exercise prudence in its accountability of public resources, as 
promised in its manifesto. Hon. Malewezi also disclosed that 
the government has already ordered the auditing of books in the 
civil service, a practice which, he said, was largely neglected 
in the former government.

  [Text] It is apparently getting pretty rough in the United 
Nations assembly camps in Mozambique. Hundreds of soldiers from 
the government side and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] 
have been kicking their heels for months, waiting to be 
demobilized. Conditions are often poor, the troops have run out 
of patience with the slow progress of the operation. There has 
been a string of mutinies, but the worst yet has occurred in a 
Renamo camp when troops turned on one of their most senior 
officers. From Maputo, Barnaby Philips reports: 
  [Begin Philips recording] UN and diplomatic sources told me 
this morning of the most dramatic mutiny so far in the 
Mozambican peace process. It occurred yesterday in a Renamo 
assembly area in the northern province of Zambezia. One of 
Renamo's most senior generals, Brigadier Raul Dique, was set 
upon by his own men. The UN source said that Brig. Dique was 
stripped, tied to a tree, and beaten in the face and stomach. 
He apparently lost some teeth and his ribcage is understood to 
have been badly damaged. Diplomatic sources confirmed that 
Brig. Dique had been roughed up and said he was recuperating in 
a UN military hospital. 
  In Maputo, Renamo have refused to say anything about the 
incident. It is only the latest in the now almost daily riots 
which are afflicting both government and Renamo assembly areas 
across Mozambique. The riots are getting increasingly violent 
and UN military observers in the camps are themselves becoming 
the target of that violence. 
  All this was due to be discussed at a meeting in Maputo this 
afternoon between top UN, government, and Renamo figures. The 
UN will be (?arguing) that the brutal treatement handed out to 
Brig. Dique will provide the necessary motivations to both sides 
to speed up the mobilization process. [end recording]

  [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello has said it is 
clear that the situation in assembly areas is growing worse. 
Aldo Ajello said it is urgently necessary to find a solution -- 
specifically, to close the assembly areas and demobilize the 
soldiers. The head of the UN Operations in Mozambique was 
reacting to the incident which occurred in the Mocubela assembly 
area in Zambezia Province, in which mutinying Mozambique 
National Resistance [Renamo] soldiers detained, stripped, and 
assaulted Brigadier Raul Dique, head of that movement's 
delegation in the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. The soldiers are 
protesting the amount to be paid to the demobilized soldiers and 
demanding the full payment of demobilization subsidies when they 
are demobilized. The CCF will hold a meeting on 6 June to 
discuss the incidents in the assembly areas. The Supervision 
and Control Commission will meet on 8 June to assess the issue.

  [Text] The chairman of the Niassa Provincial Elections 
Commission said it will not contact the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] to open its areas to the voter registration 
process, because it is not its duty to contact parties but the 
government's duty. He was commenting about Renamo advisers' 
remarks to the Niassa provincial governor that the process will 
not begin in Renamo-controlled areas if the provincial elections 
commission does not contact it. 
  In Niassa Province, the voter registration process has only 
begun in the city of Lichinga and district capitals. A source 
from the provincial elections commission said the process has 
not yet begun in other areas because of a lack of 
transportation. The process has also not yet begun in 
Renamo-controlled areas.

  [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano admitted 
yesterday that the decision to change the Preferential Trade 
Area [PTA] organization to the Southern African Economic 
Community [Comesa] was a forced step. Chissano said this soon 
after registering as a voter at the Josina Machel School in 
Maputo. 
  "We think it was a forced step," he told MEDIAFAX. "We need 
other forms of relationship before we can have a true Comesa. 
We shall do all we can however to realize Comesa's objective." 
  Despite the hustle and bustle, we were able to ask President 
Chissano three [as published] questions. 
  [MEDIAFAX] What do you expect from the World Economic Forum 
scheduled for next week in Cape Town? 
  [Chissano] "I expect the participants to compare views to 
discover the world's main concerns with regard to economic 
development and cooperation in southern Africa, after the end of 
apartheid." 
  [MEDIAFAX] Is there any other thing you consider important? 
  [Chissano] "Yes. There is a need to convey a message that 
will convince the international community and businessmen that 
there is peace in southern Africa and we all intend to establish 
a harmonious development." 
  [MEDIAFAX] What additional short term regional integration 
steps can be taken? 
  [Chissano] "I see a greater utilization of the South African 
potentialities in assisting the development of other countries. 
I also see increasing trade and exchange of technology between 
the countries of the region and South Africa. In the past there 
was activity, but it could not be exploited to the maximum 
because of apartheid." 
  [MEDIAFAX] Do you accept the zero option and the elimination 
of customs duty at regional borders? 
  [Chissano] "This is an issue that must be carefully studied 
because there are already three organizations in the region -- 
the Southern African Development Community, the PTA, and the 
Customs Union -- each one with its own rules. The situation 
must be studied so that no one is put at a disadvantage. In 
Mozambique, we advocate gradual steps to consolidate economic 
unity".

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Jacobie: "Hereros Want Koevoet Members </F>
Back"; "Mandela Has Koevoet Letter"] 
  [Text] The controversial issue concerning former members of 
the security forces who left Namibia in 1991 because of a 
comprehensive intimidation campaign against them, has landed on 
the desk of the newly elected South African state president, Mr. 
Nelson Mandela, amidst increasing political embarrassment to the 
Namibian Government. The issue concerning the return of former 
members of military units is developing into a local and 
international embarrassment for Namibia after the Committee on 
Defense and Security of the Frontline States advised in Windhoek 
in April that the soldiers should be allowed to return to their 
country of birth. Namibia was also present at the conference and 
not only made proposals concerning the return of Namibians from 
South Africa, but also suggested that former soldiers who left 
Zimbabwe after independence should be allowed to return to their 
country. In the latest initiative concerning the fate of 
approximately 12,000 Namibians in South Africa, the king of the 
Hereros, Mr. Kuaima Riruako, addressed the issue in a letter to 
President Sam Nujoma and also sent a copy of the letter to Mr. 
Mandela. Mr. Riruako emphasized that the soldiers and their 
families -- mainly former members of Koevoet [crowbar; former 
police counterinsurgency unit] and the territorial forces -- 
left the country at that stage because they could not depend on 
the protection of the government. 
  "The Namibian Government's hesitation, even refusal, to 
allow 
these Namibians to return to the country of their birth is a 
flagrant violation of their constitutional rights. These former 
soldiers are Namibians by birth or are descendants of Namibians 
and include more than a hundred Hereros and their families. 
Since these people fled from Namibia it can be deduced that at 
that stage they could not hope for any protection from 
government. What makes things worse is that the constitution 
determines that no person, as a citizen through birth or those 
of Namibian descent, may be denied citizenship. This clearly 
indicates that Namibians can come and go as they please. In 
light of this constitutional right, the Herero king is calling 
on President Sam Nujoma to honor his oath, that is, to protect 
the constitution at all times. Mr. Nujoma should also respect 
the rights of Namibians who want to return to their country and 
he should ensure that they be allowed to return home without any 
further delay," according to Mr. Riruako's letter to the two 
heads of state.

  [Text] The government and three public service unions today 
signed an agreement to review workers' salaries and conditions 
of service with effect from 1 April 1994. The chairman of the 
joint negotiating team, Mr. Namukolo Mukutu, declined to give 
the percentages of the increases. Speaking at a joint signing 
ceremony at Dalvadia Hostel in Lusaka this afternoon, Mr. Mukutu 
said it is important for Zambians to realize that negotiations 
for salaries and conditions of service are private matters 
between employers and employees. Mr. Mukutu explained that the 
negotiations are based on ensuring the wellbeing of the workers 
and ensuring the negotiations do not create undue pressure on 
the national economy. The public service unions had earlier 
declined an offer by government of a 30 percent increase 
calculated on the amount of 12 billion kwacha set aside for the 
negotiations by the state.

  [Text] Harare Jun 2 SAPA -- Zimbabwe has opened an embassy 
in Pretoria and consulates in Johannesburg and Cape Town, Ziana 
News Agency reported on Thursday. Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs 
Ministry said the embassy was being headed by a Charge 
d'Affaires Chitsaka Chipaziwa, who was previously in charge of 
the ministry's Africa and Middle East Desk. The Johannesburg 
consulate replaced the trade mission which was in place during 
the apartheid era. It would be responsible for issuing visas 
and travel documents and for attending to the welfare of 
Zimbabwean citizens in South Africa. The Cape Town consulate 
would, among other things, follow parliamentary sessions. 
  Zimbabwe was one of the harshest critics of South Africa's 
racial policy and refused to establish full diplomatic links 
with its southern neighbour until after democratic elections.

determine Afrikaners' views on a possible volkstaat [homeland] 
is only one of several options being considered by the 
government in response to right-wing demands. Speaking after a 
meeting with ANC regional leaders in Durban, Mr. Mandela said 
there was no firm statement about a referendum. 
  President Mandela said the issue of when regional 
governments 
would have powers to execute their duties had not been 
discussed. ANC sources at this morning's conference said one of 
the issues discussed with President Mandela concerned the court 
case brought by the ANC in the region about alleged election 
fraud. It's understood that President Mandela advised the ANC 
to withdraw the case.

  [Text] Amnesty for more than 50 right-wingers accused of 
several bomb blasts before the elections came under the 
spotlight again this evening at a meeting between Justice 
Minister Dullah Omar and Conservative Party [CP] leader, Ferdi 
Hartzenberg. In a statement issued a short while ago, the 
Conservative Party said Mr. Omar had agreed to consider a number 
of proposals. These include an extension of the amnesty for 
so-called political prisoners from the present cut-off date of 
December the 5th last year, to the date when final agreement is 
reached on the amnesty. Gary Alfonso reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Alfonso] More than 50 right-wing 
supporters were arrested and subsequently released on bail after 
a spate of bombings shortly before the country's historic 
all-race elections just over a month ago. Few doubt that the 
explosions were aimed at destabilizing the election process. 
Justice Minister Dullah Omar said on SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] television last night that the people 
who carried out these acts, as well as the Chris Hani killers, 
Janusz Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis, were not eligible for 
amnesty. But according to CP leader, Ferdi Hartzenberg, who met 
with Mr. Omar this evening, agreement on what he called equal 
treatment for all had been reached earlier with President 
Mandela. 
  [Hartzenberg] There was this agreement between us and the 
president that all the people will get the same treatment and 
the same principles will be applied, so I think we must first 
have a discussion with the minister. 
  [Alfonso] Talks about amnesty for the right-wingers in 
question is not just an issue of an agreement between the 
Conservative Party and the minister of justice. The 1993 
constitution would have to be revisited, and that can only be 
changed by Parliament and the government of national unity.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria June 2 SAPA -- Rightwing demands for new 
amnesty provisions for political offenders apparently failed in 
Pretoria on Thursday [2 June]. Conservative Party [CP] leader 
Ferdie Hartzenberg headed a delegation to see Justice Minister 
Dullah Omar to discuss a relaxation of constitutional provisions 
for criminal offenders motivated by political gain. 
  Dr Hartzenberg said before his meeting he would raise the 
issue of long-time CP member Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, 
who are on death row for the murder of SA [South African] 
Communist Party leader Chris Hani. He disclosed that his 
request for the extension of the December 6 cut-off date for 
amnesty application was to accommodate right-wingers who 
unleashed a terror bombing campaign before the April elections. 
  Dr Hartzenberg came away from the meeting saying the CP had 
made its proposals and the minister had undertaken to consider 
them. In a statement later, delegation member and the CP's 
justice spokesman Jurg Prinsloo outlined the CP's proposals. He 
said the minister had undertaken to reply to them after internal 
consultations. 
  The CP asked the minister to give "temporary immunity" to 
convicted prisoners, to those awaiting trial, to those who had 
been identified as suspects, and to those who had not yet been 
identified but whose acts were being investigated. 
  Mr Prinsloo said the minister had not closed any doors. 
However, he said the minister had issued a statement shortly 
after the meeting. He had a copy of the statement which 
repeated the minister's use of the December 6 cut-off date. 
  Mr Omar said in considering the criteria for political 
offences, one should not assume that these would be as broad as 
to enable Derby-Lewis and Walus to be accommodated, and he 
apparently said a "truth commission" would be established. 
  The minister's spokesman was not available for comment. 
  Mr Prinsloo said the CP would give its reply on Friday to 
the 
minister's rejection of its proposals.

  [Text] Pretoria June 3 SAPA -- Conservative Party [CP] 
leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, angered by Justice Minister Dullah 
Omar's apparent rejection of the CP's petition for new amnesty 
provisions, on Friday [3 June] accused Mr Omar of breaking an 
agreement with the CP. 
  Dr Hartzenberg led a delegation to Mr Omar in Pretoria on 
Thursday to plead for an extension of the December 6 amnesty 
cut-off date. He also asked the minister to consider South 
African Communist Party [Secretary General] Chris Hani's 
killers, Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, as ordinary 
political criminals. 
  Although Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement on Friday the 
minister had broken his word by releasing a press statement 
which categorically turned down the CP's proposals, Mr Omar's 
spokesman David Pirogo said the minister's statement was not 
related to his meeting with the CP. 
  The statement said the deadline would not be extended and 
that the definition of political offenders may not be so broad 
as to include Derby-Lewis and Walus. 
  "Our statement had nothing to do with the meeting. But Dr 
Hartzenberg is free to draw his own conclusions," Mr Pirogo 
said. He said he issued the minister's statement before the 
meeting "to clarify certain issues regarding amnesty". 
  Dr Hartzenberg said he was surprised by Mr Omar's statement 
which had come immediately after their meeting. He said he had 
reached agreement with the minister that no final decisions on 
amnesty would be made now. The minister had undertaken to 
consider all the CP's proposals and to hold further discussions 
with the party. He said the minister had agreed to discuss 
final amnesty legislation with the CP. 
  He said the minister had also agreed that the media would be 
told only that discussions had taken place on the CP's proposals 
and that follow-up discussions would be held. "While the CP 
kept to this agreement and simply made its proposals known to 
the media, Mr Omar broke the agreement. Without the promised 
consultation and discussions with the CP he unilaterally 
announced that the final cut-off date would be fixed at December 
5. 
  "During the discussions the CP asked Mr Omar to not refer in 
public to the matter of Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, and 
not to present it as an exception. This request was simply 
ignored and in his statement he indicates that the case of 
Derby-Lewis and Walus will be handled differently to other 
cases. The CP finds this out of place," Dr Hartzenberg said. 
  CP justice spokesman Jurg Prinsloo said that if Mr Omar 
issued his statement before the meeting as Mr Pirogo had 
claimed, this in itself implied that the CP had been negotiating 
about matters that had already been decided.

  [Text] Johannesburg June 2 SAPA -- One of eight AWB 
[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement] 
suspects being sought by police in connection with a series of 
bomb blasts on the Witwatersrand handed himself over to 
authorities on Wednesday [1 June], SAPS [South African Police 
Services] spokesman Col Dave Bruce said on Thursday. 
  The suspect would appear in the Johannesburg magistrates 
court at 2PM on Thursday (today) to make a bail application, the 
colonel added. The suspect, a member of the AWB's so-called 
"ystergarde" (iron guard), was as yet the only one of the eight 
outstanding suspects to have been arrested, Col Bruce said. 
  Several other rightists have already appeared in court in 
connection with the blasts. Most have been granted bail.

  [Text] Last week's Executive Committee meeting of the HNP 
[Reformed National Party] was, in terms of numbers and 
enthusiasm, the most successful in years. The audience filled 
the Premos Hall. 
  Leader Jaap Marais's speech, in which he summed up the 
current situation in the country and showed the way ahead, was 
one of his most inspiring ever, and it put the stamp on this 
most historic moment in the history of the Afrikaner nation 
[volk]. It proved there was no dejection among the 
principle-bound right-wingers -- only determination and an 
eagerness to accept the struggle that lies ahead and to take the 
bull by the horns. 
  Mr. Marais pointed out that the unitary idea being advocated 
in newspapers and speeches were hollow slogans without any real 
content. The whole idea of a lot of loose, totally different 
groupings of people of all races embraced in a declaration of 
human rights has only one aim, and that is to establish a new 
basis for American imperialism. The volk's unity must be broken 
down and the people must be involved in human rights as 
individuals -- that is the American plan being used to get at 
the Afrikaner nation and its political power. That is the 
contemporary form of American imperialism. 
  We are not dealing simply with a black government, nor even 
a 
black communist government, but with an attempt to complete the 
British-American plan of the last century to eliminate the 
Afrikaner nation from the African political scenery. 
  In 1948, the same politics suffered its greatest setback. 
Malan, Strydom, and especially Verwoerd opposed the 
British-American plan and foiled it for half a century. Now 
that Verwoerd has been murdered, they have again come to the top 
and they want to complete their efforts by transforming southern 
Africa into one big communist state. Back in 1976, Kissinger 
publicly said he wanted one black state in this part of the 
world. 
  The negotiation process has been the lifeblood of the 
terrorists' victory. It was an all-embracing British-American 
imperialist success -- not the birth of a new nation, which was 
a nonsensical theme of the [inaugural] celebrations. 
  A nation is not built by a constitution; neither does it get 
destroyed by one, as the plan seems to be. Nations are 
indestructible, Mr. Marais said. 
  The state which the British and Americans have rigged up 
will 
for many years to come be a totally unstable political product. 
Should there arise serious differences of opinion in Parliament 
-- of that everyone can be sure of -- the ANC will simply fall 
back on a referendum and thereafter call another election. It 
will be a product of black Africa. Nowhere in Africa have the 
blacks built anything worthwhile -- nothing that has lasted. 
The bespectacled blacks in expensive clothes that one sees on 
television are the same people living elsewhere in Africa. It 
will not be different here than anywhere in Africa, Mr. Marais 
said. 
  South Africa will only get from them an unstable state, 
characteristic of them. The enmity between Zulus and Xhosas is 
built in; it will eventually have to be resolved the African 
way. The threat to the future of the whites; the threat to 
Afrikaner nationhood is built in. The prospect of an attempt at 
a second, open communist revolution is built in. 
  The Afrikaner sees all these things. He acknowledges the 
situation for what it is, but the Afrikaner will not let the 
matter rest there. He acknowledges it in a spirit of 
resistance, of stubbornness, just like the Boer generals in 
1902, Mr. Marais said -- to lengthy applause.

<F P=106> [From the "Commentary" column] </F>
  [Text] From President Ezer Weizman and Rabbi Harris to 
Yasir 'Arafat and Benazir Bhutto; from Fidel Castro to Prince 
Philip and Madame Mitterand; the countries they represent are 
all competing to gain favor with the new regime in South Africa. 
  However, it is not the rubbery smile of Nelson Mandela that 
they are after, but rather control over the minerals on South 
Africa's territory, and the strategic power that goes with it. 
  The race, however, has already been won by Western 
countries, 
and to be more precise, by Britain and America, who have been 
the real bosses of Mandela and the ANC for the last 10 years. 
So much so that it would have been more fitting if their flags 
alone were fluttering over the Union Buildings -- if there had 
been any honesty in diplomatic protocol. 
  Just as British and American financiers had helped the 
Bolsheviks of Lenin and Trotsky to come to power in 1917 in 
Russia, so too have Britain and America over the last 10 years 
under Thatcher and Major, as well as under Carter, Bush, and 
Clinton, helped the communist regime of Mandela and Slovo into 
the saddle. 
  South African communists who fled before the security police 
did not go to Moscow, but to London where the South African 
Communist Party has its headquarters. 
  The American State Department financed the ANC for a quarter 
of a century and had given guidance in its specialized 
activities. At the same time the big brains of Harvard, who do 
the thinking on behalf of American foreign policy such as the 
controversial Samuel Huntington, had been doing their best to 
undermine the will of the incompetent South African Government, 
well supported by "diplomats" of the caliber of Chester Crocker. 
  The real victory smiles on Tuesday's photos [Mandela's 
inauguration day] were those of Douglas Hurd, Hillary Clinton, 
and Al Gore. However, he who laughs last laughs best. The 
Afrikaner leaders, who are still going to capsize the whole 
situation in our country, are going to laugh the best. It will 
be their smiles that will be remembered the longest...

  [Text] Cape Town June 2 SAPA -- None of the standing 
committees that have to approve legislation before it can be 
debated in Parliament have been finalised, the head of 
Parliament's committee section, Mr Willem Fourie, said on 
Thursday. He said the composition of some of the multiparty 
committees should be decided "in the next day or so". 
  There had been delays in getting names of prospective 
committee members from parties and there had also been queries 
over incomplete or defective lists. 
  He had been asked to expedite the formation of the 
constitutional affairs, education, finance, home affairs, 
justice, public accounts and security services committees 
because there was apparently legislation for them in the 
pipeline. 
  He had been hoping it would be possible to reduce the number 
of committees from 26, or one for each ministerial portfolio, to 
about 18. 
  He made this proposal to the African National Congress but 
was told they were "not very happy with that". 
  "At this point I'm not sure how many there will be 
eventually," he said.

<F P=106> [By Greta Steyn] </F>
  [Excerpt] Only about R200m [million rand] would be 
allocated specifically to the new provincial governments in the 
Budget this month to finance their administrations, state 
expenditure director-general Hannes Smit said yesterday. Since 
the old administrations would continue running regional 
government functions in the short term, the usual allocations to 
the four provinces, the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, 
Ciskei] and the self-governing territories would be made, he 
said. 
  "The Budget will have exactly the same format as in previous 
years, except for a supplementary spending proposal to finance 
the provincial cabinets," he said. The amount -- less than 
R200m -- would not add to overall spending totals. 
  The total allocation to each region would be linked to 
functions, such as education, at present performed by those 
governments in the TBVC. As functions were formally handed to 
the new provinces, they would use the finance allocated to the 
old administrations -- as well as central government allocations. 
  One exception was housing, where central government's 
allocation went to the national housing fund, which would 
distribute it to the regions, Smit said. 
  At present, there is a national housing board and four 
regional housing boards with access to central government funds. 
The relationship between the regional boards and the provincial 
governments has not yet been defined. Sources said the boards 
were operating in terms of National Housing Forum policies, but 
that could change if regional housing ministers disagreed with 
the policies. 
  Smit said a law would be passed soon to establish the 
reconstruction fund, which would kick off with R2.5bn [billion] 
from government. 
  Sources said the first direct allocations to the new 
regional 
governments were likely to come from the reconstruction fund. 
These allocations might be made before the fiscal and financial 
commission -- to be appointed before the end of the month -- had 
decided on formulas for sharing revenue. [passage omitted]

  At an international news conference in Pretoria today, he 
said a British military assistance and training team was to help 
with the selection and evaluation of former NPKF members for 
their possible inclusion in the National Defense Force. General 
Meiring also said that a service brigade could be formed to 
support the government's Reconstruction and Development Program. 
  [Begin Meiring recording] Such an organization could form 
part of the Reconstruction and Development Program, in so far as 
it firstly, forms part of a sort of a funnel for people that do 
not make the grade in the National Defense Force to be

acquire skills, to enable them to better use themselves outside 
in a civilian role, and also in doing this, delivering some 
worthwhile action. [end recording]

  [Text] Cape Town Jun 3 SAPA -- A controversial 4-million 
rand tourist development at Cape Point was given the go-ahead by 
the Regional Services Council [RSC] after a special on-site 
meeting Thursday [2 June]. The move was welcomed by Cape Point 
chief nature conservation officer Mr Howard Langley, but was 
slammed by green pressure groups. RSC councillors were met at 
Cape Point Thursday by protesters. 
  RSC chairman Mr Piet Loubser said the executive committee's 
decision had been unanimous. "The professional (environmental) 
people we've had to advise us have done a fine job and the new 
development will have less impact on the natural environment 
than the present facilities." 
  The R4 million development, which could be completed within 
a 
year, includes a sunken restaurant below the parking area with 
rockeries and indigenous plants on its roof, and a funicular 
rail system to replace the buses to the Cape Point view site. 
  "Everything humanly possible would be done to ensure there

  Protesters bore banners and placards reading "no 
environmental impact assessment. No public participation. No 
unilateral decision!", "Our Point, our decision", "Will the 
people benefit", "1990 proposals -- what happened?", "Cape Point 
is our heritage" and "Cape Point real estate" over-written with 
"sold".

  [Text] Johannesburg June 2 SAPA -- Three hundred million US 
dollars -- count 'em. That's what police searching for illegal 
firearms in a Turffontein, Johannesburg house came across early 
on Thursday [2 June] evening. 
  SA Police Services [SAPS] spokesman Capt Wikus Weber said 
members of the Vaal Triangle firearm unit, following up on 
leads, went to the Turffontein property. The officers found 
firearms -- "but they turned out to be legal". 
  What wasn't so legal, though, was a pile of counterfeit us 
dollars big enough to make even your bank manager drool -- three 
million hundred dollar notes. 
  Police also took possession of printing apparatus and placed 
under arrest a 60-year-old man who would probably appear in 
court on Friday, the SAPS spokesman said.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Food and Health Care -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 
on 3 June carries an editorial on page 10 arguing that a school 
feeding program, primary health care, and free hospital 
treatment for pregnant women and children under six should be 
considered as "an investment in the people of this country." It 
goes on to assert that the cost of the investment cannot be 
shirked but that the program must be carefully monitored to 
ensure "that every cent is wisely spent and that programmes 
benefit those who need them." Proposals in the Reconstruction 
and Development Program will, the editorial continues, "help to 
reduce the racial disparities in health, educational level, life 
expectancy and other factors highlighted in regularly by studies 
of our population. We now have a government which no longer 
shrugs off these statistics as a Third World inevitability. 
Given fiscal discipline and sensible priorities, a programme 
aimed at uplifting the needy can buoy the whole nation by 
turning this country into one of which all of us can, at last, 
be proud." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Government Urged To End Violence -- "Government's 100-day 
timetable for the delivery of tangible benefits through 
reconstruction and development last month was encouraging in the 
extreme," begins the Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 3 
June in a page-14 editorial. "But in focusing on the new 
imperatives, we must not forget the priorities we inherited from 
the apartheid administration. We must not underplay the 
importance of eradicating the violence that has over the past 10 
years cost this nation tens of thousands of lives." If the 
violence is not eradicated reconstruction will be "meaningless." 
"While we have a new government, the obligation to end the 
violence has not changed. What is different, though, is that the 
new government is not weighed down by the moral culpability that 
held back its predecessor." "Given the culpability of the past 
government in the killings and complete absence of a moral will 
to disarm the perpetrators of this violence, we understood the 
NP's [National Party] failures to halt the violence. We also 
understood the inability of the democratic forces to respond 
decisively to the violence, given their lack of access to the 
instruments of state security. But this has all changed." 
<H8>  CITIZEN </H8>
  Disbanding of Peacekeeping Forces -- "With the disbandment 
today of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], the costly and 
sorry effort to train a peacekeeping force to supplement the 
role of the army and police in the election period has come to 
an end," begins the Johannesburg CITIZEN in English on 2 June in 
a page-6 editorial. "The NPKF was a blunder of great magnitude," 
laments the editorial. "We blame the ANC alliance for this 
terrible waste of money (the NPKF's budget was R390 million 
[rand])." "Why it thought that a peackeeping force was 
necessary .... is beyond us. In the event, the police and army 
kept the peace so well during the election that President 
Mandela has given them his warm commendation." "President 
Mandela has set the tone for the open-hearted acceptance of the 
security forces, and we expect the campaign of denigration, 
particularly of the police, will now be a thing of the past." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Accommodation of Right Wing Viewed -- "The willingness which 
President Mandela displays toward the right wing can help a lot 
to take the sting of aggression out of that quarter," but in the 
long run it could be dangerous if right-wingers read too much 
into it, notes a page-12 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 1 June. "The danger is that right-wingers could 
deduce from President Mandela's efforts to involve them in the 
political process that an Afrikaner homeland is going to be 
presented to them on a silver tray." Election results meanwhile 
have shown that support for a homeland is "minimal." What the 
right wing gained from the election was a political party -- 
Gen. Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front -- a seat in Parliament, 
provincial legislators, and a homeland council. "It is unlikely 
that the right wing will be further accommodated." "An 
interesting question, however, is whether further concessions 
for the right wing are still necessary. Like other South 
Africans, the right-wingers have already seen that the election 
and developments thereafter went off well, and life is 
continuing normally," so why still clamor for a limited piece of 
homeland "when he has the whole country to live and work in?" 
  Amnesty for Political Prisoners -- A second editorial on the 
same page of the 1 June BEELD states that "every South African 
who has ever rejected violence as a political means must feel 
uncomfortable when the question of amnesty for political 
criminals is mentioned. Amnesty is a necessary evil, however." 
Since two extensions in amnesty deadlines have already been 
made, "politicians and other experts must consider whether a 
third extension is really necessary," and if it has to happen, 
"it should be the very last." "The election has been a miracle, 
but it has not yet freed South Africa from people who think they 
can attain political goals through violence." 
<H8>  ILANGA </H8>
  Government Health, Feeding Schemes Welcomed -- Durban ILANGA 
in Zulu in its 31 May-1 June edition writes in a page 6 
editorial that "President Nelson Mandela's statement in 
Parliament that he would compel his government to urgently 
attend to the implementation of programs like giving free 
medical treatment for black children under six years and 
expectant women is very commendable." Another welcome 
announcement by the president is that primary school children 
will now get supplementary feeding where necessary." "The new 
government should move swiftly to fulfill these promises, even 
though it might not be easy to find the finance to back them up."

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 2 Jun (KNA/PANA) -- The third bench of 
the Central High Court in Addis Ababa has sentenced Daniel 
Kifle, a journalist, to 18 months' imprisonment after finding 
him guilty of publishing malicious canards in a private Amharic 
weekly, FENDISHA, reports PANA. 
  According to the central prosecutor's office of Region 14, 
[Addis Ababa region] the court convicted Daniel of publishing a 
false report in the 14th January 1994 issue of the weekly, under 
the headline: "The Involvement of Prime Minister Tamirat Layne 
in Mercury Trade Exposed". 
  The story alleged that the prime minister sold confiscated 
mercury and gold for millions of birr (the local currency) while 
on working visits abroad. 
  A statement issued by the prosecutor's office said the 
journalist also published a series of fabrications including the 
replacement of troops guarding one of the country's major 
hydro-electric dam at K'ok'a [Central Province]. 
  Daniel was also reported to have published a false report 
under the headline "Everything to the Northern War Front", 
alleging the encampment of 10,000 troops in Debre Zebit [Central 
Province] with the mission of suppressing swiftly any 
anti-government uprising. 
  The prosecutor's office said the false stories constituted a 
malicious defamation of the prime minister and the defense 
establishment, and a violation of the country's press law and 
the penal code. The court passed the sentence on the convict 
after rejecting all his counter evidences presented during the 
trial, the prosecutor's office said. 
  In a related development, the Central Court imprisoned on 
Wednesday [1 June], Mulugeta Lule, editor-in-chief of TOBIA, a 
private magazine and fined him 10,000 birr, about 1,600 U.S. 
dollars, for publishing and disseminating false stories. The 
prosecutor's office accused him of publishing unfounded reports 
on troop deployments at Gondar and Gojam [Provinces] in the 
November issue of the magazine which reported that the Army 
killed 647 EPRDF (Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic 
Front) militants and captured 60 others.

  [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
repeated his invitation to Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, 
Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and 
the acting president of Burundi to a meeting in Nairobi on 
Monday, 6 June. This will be to deliberate on lasting peace to 
Rwanda. 
  In a statement issued in State House, Nakuru, President Moi 
said the Rwandan problem is so complex that it not only requires 
serious commitment to peace by all concerned but also needs an 
agreed approach by all neighbors of Rwanda who are now affected 
in one way or the other. He added that the meeting would 
require the presence of all heads of state invited. He pointed 
out that if one may not be able to attend, the meeting will be 
postponed until all heads of state concerned are present. 
President Moi expressed grave concern regarding the loss of 
life of the innocent citizens of Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Danial arap Moi in Nyayo Stadium, </F>
Nairobi, on 1 June -- live] 
  [Excerpts] My dear Kenyans, ladies and gentlemen: We 
assemble here today to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the day 
we attained self-government, this is Madaraka [self-government] 
Day. This day is an important one because it marks the first 
significant step made by our people in their struggle to be 
free. [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating this year's 
Madaraka 
day against a background of optimism and suffering by our 
people. We are all aware of the many social and economic 
hardships that ordinary Kenyans have had to put up with in the 
last two years due to worldwide economic recession whose effects 
were made worse by prolonged drought. During the same period we 
have had to implement far-reaching economic and political 
reforms. That we were able to successfully undertake 
comprehensive reforms is a testimony of the resilience of our 
nationhood. Indeed, few countries in Africa would have gone 
through such a transformation without the risk of social 
turmoil. I am therefore most grateful to Kenyans, particularly 
the ordinary men and women who bore the brunt of most of these 
reforms. I am equally grateful to our friends who have tried to 
understand the negative social impact some of the measures have 
had on our people. In spite of these short-term setbacks, I am 
convinced that the reforms that we have implemented would lead 
to renewed to economic growth and prosperity for our people. 
  What is urgently needed, and my government is taking 
adequate 
measures, is to sharpen the reforms and to focus on the social 
dimensions of development. This should be done by developing 
programs in all the relevant ministries to address the basic 
needs of the poor and disadvantaged in search of security, food, 
school fees and textbooks, medical services, transport and 
water. The identification of needy cases and the provision of 
assistance will be done by the local relief and welfare 
committees. My government has already started these programs by 
providing school fees and safety nets for those retiring from 
the public service. My government is also making budgetary 
provisions to strengthen this program in the 1994-95 financial 
year. I am, however, making a very strong appeal to the donor 
community to join us in refocusing the structural adjustment 
programs to an approach which meets all the noble ideals of 
balanced development. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, as I said during the recent 
international investment conference, my government is fully 
committed to a market driven economy which will attract foreign 
investments. However, my government is concerned with the 
increasing marginalization of sections of our population as we 
open up the economy to market forces. This is an area which 
cannot be left to market forces alone and that is why ways and 
means must be found to cushion the vulnerable groups from the 
adverse effects of economic liberalization. As we grumble with 
the effect of these reforms it must be understood by all that 
the concept of transparency and accountability is not expected 
to be applicable only to the people of Kenya, for to do so is 
tantamount to saying that Kenyans cannot be trusted or be relied 
upon, that would be most unfair. Recognizing that no society on 
earth can claim to be perfect, we will continue to serve our 
people in the best manner possible. In turn, we expect foreign 
organizations and institutions based in Kenya, especially the 
nongovernmental organizations, to conduct their affairs openly, 
fairly and with due regard to the laws of this country. 
  Dear Kenyans, as we celebrate this day when we attained 
internal self-government it is also appropriate to review the 
political atmosphere in our country. Seventeen months ago we 
held the elections which ushered in a multiparty Parliament. 
The elections were preceded by intensive political activities, 
which unfortunately, divided Kenyans along ethnic lines. Today, 
long after elections were concluded, Kenyans still look at one 
another with suspicion. Some leaders continue to regard 
themselves as the guardians of the interests of their supporters 
only. Besides, some leaders continue to spend a lot of useful 
time politicking rather than guiding Kenyans into 
development-related activities. Indeed, one of the reasons why 
the economy performed poorly last year was because of our people 
spending many man hours in unproductive activities. 
  Fellow citizens, it is upon you to decide on your future and 
as your president I urge you to choose hard work for prosperity 
and development. Kenyans are known for their determination, 
commitment, and hard work. Indeed, since independence the 
culture of hard work, unity and love for one another has been 
responsible for the significant development that the various 
sectors have registered. Regrettably, we risk losing the culture 
of hard work, tolerance, and unity of purpose if we continue 
engaging ourselves in activities that would not benefit anyone. 
Tribalism is on the rise. Politicization of almost every aspect 
of our social life is getting entrenched and an increasing 
number of Kenyans are spending their most valuable times in idle 
talk. This has to stop. Ladies and gentlemen, the time to 
arrest this situation is now. We must ensure that tribalism 
does not gain a foothold in our society. After all, the many 
patriots who made it possible for us to be free people set aside 
their ethnic differences in order to pursue their common 
objectives. It is therefore incumbent upon all leaders from 
KANU [Kenya African National Union], the opposition, the clergy 
and other categories of leadership to demonstrate their 
commitment to a united Kenya. 
  On my part, I will always, as I have done throughout my 
political carrier, champion the interests of all without fear or 
favor. Events taking place in neighboring countries should 
serve as a reminder to Kenyans to guard against divisive 
politics. As I have often said it is the ordinary mwananchi 
[citizen] who is the innocent victim when a chaotic situation 
grips any country. My government will not tolerate leaders who 
are bent on inciting people or diverting their efforts from 
those which enable them to earn their livelihood in a peaceful 
atmosphere. Equally, the government will give all necessary 
assistance to leaders who are genuinely interested in helping 
Kenyans improve their standards of living. I have deliberately 
emphasized the need for us to remain united because I genuinely 
believe that Kenyans have a right to live in peace with one 
another. Indeed, that was the main reason our forefathers waged 
a bitter struggle to win freedom from political domination. 
Leaders bent on inciting Kenyans and wasting their times are 
betraying the very spirit which was the driving force behind the 
struggle for independence. [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, events taking place in other parts of 
Africa are both disturbing and regrettable. Indeed, unless the 
unwarranted killings and displacement of people stops our 
continent faces a very bleak future. The loss of lives taking 
place in Rwanda, Somalia, and southern Sudan must stop. There 
can be no justification for such a heavy toll of human lives. 
Regrettably, the loss of lives taking place in some parts of 
Africa is happening at a time when donors are increasingly 
diverting interests from the continent. African leaders must 
appreciate that the continent is on the verge of complete 
marginalization from the rest of the world. We must act now to 
save this continent from social turmoil or disintegration. On 
our part, Kenya will continue to participate in efforts to bring 
lasting peace to conflict-torn parts of Africa. In view of the 
serious concern I attach to problems facing the people of 
Rwanda, I have requested my colleagues President Mobutu Sese 
Seko of Zaire, President Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, and 
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda to join me in a meeting 
which is being proposed for 6 June, Monday. But I am not 
optimistic of this meeting, because of the complicated tragedy 
which took place in Rwanda. Because it is so complicated, no one 
hopes for a clearer future. 
  Many international communities all over the world wonder why 
neighbors are not rushing to save Rwandans. It is because of 
that complication. I pray God that Rwandan leaders will be 
shown the right way to protect the lives of the innocent 
children, women, and the entire Rwandan people. The state of 
genocide that gripped that country is indeed chilling and 
unbearable. It must come to an end, if that country is to move 
forward. 
  My fellow countrymen, the conflicts which face some African 
countries should make us Kenyans resolve to maintain peace which 
we have enjoyed since independence. We owe it to future 
generations to build a united, peaceful, and prosperous country. 
  As we celebrate this year's Madaraka Day let us once again 
renew our commitment to live in peace, love, and unity with one 
another. May God bless you all. Thank you.

  [Text] The minister for labor and manpower development, Mr. 
Philip Masinde, has declared the strike by the employees in the 
banking industry as illegal. In a press release today, Mr. 
Masinde said that while negotiations are still under way through 
conciliation, the workers have unilaterally taken industrial 
action contrary to the spirit of the industrial relations 
charter and the provisions of the Trade Dispute Act Chapter 234. 
He therefore said that under such circumstances, the workers' 
action was untenable and called on them to resume work 
immediately. 
  Touching on the strike by the Kenya Railways Corporation 
locomotive drivers which started yesterday, the minister also 
declared their strike illegal. Mr. Masinde pointed out that 
there exists a machinery for settlement of industrial disputes 
which must be adhered to by the parties, an action which, he 
said, the employees of the railway did not follow. He called on 
the striking railway employees to resume work immediately. 
Meanwhile, nearly 30 train drivers currently on strike have 
been sacked. In a letter signed by the district mechanical 
engineer, Mr. Mithamo, the drivers were summarily dismissed for 
deliberately absenting themselves from duty on June 1st this 
year. Subsequently, the striking drivers have been evicted from 
the staff quarters and ordered to vacate the premises of the 
corporation. 
  As part of the contingency measures, the public relations 
manager, Miss Njeri Luseno, said locomotive inspectors and 
instructor drivers from the railway training institute had been 
redeployed. She said business at all stations had fully 
resumed, adding that all passengers and cargo trains would 
continue to operate as usual. Miss Luseno pleaded for patience 
from the staff saying that the management was currently pursuing 
negotiations with the Kenya Railways Workers Union to review the 
remuneration package of the unionizable staff. Those striking 
are demanding a monthly salary of 25,000 shillings for junior 
drivers from the current 2,900 shillings and 45,000 shillings 
for senior drivers from their current pay of 5,000 shillings. 
As they packed their belongings the drivers vowed to pursue 
their grievances through the industrial court.

  [Excerpt] All major banks remained closed today following a 
strike staged by unionizable employees. The strike which went 
into effect this morning caused frustrations to hundreds of 
customers. At one Barclays Bank branch in Nairobi, a manager and 
two other employees were held hostage by customers demanding 
that the doors be opened. Unionizable employees gave a notice 
on Tuesday [31 May] saying they wanted a 70 percent pay rise. 
Their employers did not agree to the demand saying that they 
will not be able to afford it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The national consultative meeting of the 22 
political parties belonging to the Group for Solidarity 
[Groupement Pour la Solidarite, GPS] which started on 25 May 
ended yesterday at the Tiama Hotel. During their talks, the GPS 
members deliberated on particular proposals they can use to make 
government reconsider its position on foreigners' ability to 
vote. They also made suggestions to enable the Ivorian 
Government to positively review the issue of financing political 
parties. Mr. Koman Achi, GPS's chairman, comments on 
foreigners' right to vote. 
  [Begin Achi recording] No sensible and responsible Ivorian 
can accept a law whose sole aim is to guarantee the election of 
one man, but which in essence constitutes a serious threat to 
civil peace in our country and in the whole West African 
subregion. There is no country in the world where foreigners 
are authorized to vote to elect the president of the Republic. 
What prompts Cote d'Ivoire to make an exception to this rule? 
Are we more democratic in Cote d'Ivoire than other people 
around the globe? 
  Cote d'Ivoire's political parties are convinced that the law 
conferring the right for foreigners to vote will be passed if it 
is presented to parliamentarians at the National Assembly. 
Therefore, the political parties have decided to do some 
housecleaning themselves. They have made proposals on methods 
for party funding. The proposals will soon be submitted to the 
head of government and the president. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] As you already know, the first negotiations for 
the restoration of the presidential institution were officially 
launched yesterday under the chairmanship of Prime Minister 
Anatole Kanyenkiko. Yesterday, you heard the positions of the 
various political bodies of the country, the [word indistinct] 
the government coalition, and the opposition coalition. Today, 
the prime minister disclosed his stand to Marie-Jose Niyonzima. 
  [Begin Kanyenkiko recording] [Words indistinct] soon it will 
be 10 days since the beginning of talks with all social, 
political, moral, and socioeconomic forces in order to discuss 
the best way of establishing the presidential institution. Why 
is this happening today? It is because all the political, 
moral, and socioeconomic forces understand that we cannot 
organize competitive general elections in the entire national 
territory due to the fact that our country has just experienced 
a deep crisis. It is therefore impossible to organize such 
elections. The elections would also require many funds which 
the country does not have. 
  So, we first gathered suggestions from the moral and 
socioeconomic forces and today we are at the level of 
negotiations with political parties. The agenda is, first, to 
know what the new head of state and his government will 
implement, and second, to know what the mode for the setting up 
of the presidential institution will be. That is what I can 
say. Currently we are holding talks on the two subjects.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good evening! It was a dull afternoon here in 
Lusaka. Almost nothing took place this afternoon. The 
government negotiating team remained in its hotel waiting to 
hear from the representatives of the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], who this morning asked for 
more time to reflect and find solutions considered most 
appropriate for the future of the Voice of Resistance of the 
Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. 
  Regarding this issue, the government remains firm: The 
country's laws governing radio stations must be applied. This 
being the case, the government negotiating team will only agree 
to move on to other issues after the conclusion of discussions 
on the future of Vorgan. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim is cited by the 
DAILY MAIL newspaper as having said that the more government 
victories in the military field, the more serious difficulties 
the peace talks will face. He said UNITA will fight to survive. 
  In turn, the government's General Eugenio Carneiro is cited 
by the DAILY MAIL as having said that the government is ready to 
resume talks and that UNITA's participation in the government is 
a fait accompli. All the same, Gen. Carneiro said, the 
government does not agree that UNITA should impose specific 
conditions. He said the international community should continue 
to pressure UNITA to become more flexible. [end recording]

peacekeeping force in that country. However, speaking in an 
interview with REUTER news agency, President Mandela said South 
Africa was very interested in providing humanitarian aid. He

treat Rwandan refugees and was considering other assistance. 
South Africa would also consult the UN on what role South 
Africa could play to help end the conflict in that country.

  [Text] Cape Town June 2 SAPA -- Dissident members of the 
Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] have plunged the movement into a 
security crises by threatening the lives of bodyguards 
protecting PAC members of Parliament, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio new reported on Thursday [2 
June]. 
  PAC Western Cape Secretary Bathembu Lugulwana said an 
anti-election faction within the movement had accused PAC 
bodyguards of collaborating with the system and had threatened 
to kill them. 
  Conflict within the security structures of the movement 
started long before the elections when PAC youths, who had been 
sent to Transkei for military training, returned to their 
respective regions with an anti-election attitude, he said. 
  They had been sent for training to protect the rank and file 
supporters of the movement during the elections. 
  Mr Lugulwana said the youths were apparently politically 
indoctrinated by some influential leaders of the PAC in Transkei 
who were opposed to the elections.

  [Text] The genocide in Rwanda received top priority at a 
meeting of the seven Frontline States in the Zimbabwean capital 
Harare this afternoon. The organization has appealed to all 
involved to stop the killings and said it was prepared to offer 
military or other assistance to help stabilize the situation. 
Estelle Pienaar reports that South African President Nelson 
Mandela received a hero's welcome on his arrival in Harare to 
attend the meeting: 
  There was a tumultuous welcome for South Africa's President 
Nelson Mandela today as he arrived in Harare for his first 
official foreign visit as head of state. Zimbabwean vice 
president and one of the founder members of the Frontline States 
back in 1974, Mr. Joshua Nkomo, was there to meet him, but at 
the conference center in the city delegates of the Global 
Coalition for Africa who have been meeting in the Zimbabwean 
capital since yesterday, together with the Frontline States, had 
depressing matters to address. 
  The ravaging Rwanda civil war was addressed during a brief 
informal discussion of the seven Frontline States' presidents 
and South Africa's head of state, President Nelson Mandela. All 
were very concerned about the current situation in Rwanda. 
Afterwards the Frontline States met for the first time 
embracing South Africa into the brotherhood of the subcontinent.

  [Text] South African President Nelson Mandela has pledged 
to lend a hand in regional peace-making and development in 
southern Africa. These two areas are expected to be the new 
focus of the group of Frontline States formed to combat 
apartheid. Speaking on the first day of the Frontline States' 
summit in Harare, President Mandela said South Africa will play 
a crucial role in resolving the problems facing southern Africa. 
In the same vein, he said, the Frontline states were still 
necessary to help establish democracy in South Africa. 
  At today's meeting the Frontline states are expected to form 
a new structure which will concentrate on other regional 
problems in conjunction with the Southern African Development 
Community. 
  When asked about the Rwanda situation, Mr. Mandela said 
South 
Africa had already agreed to provide a field hospital and was 
now considering leasing 50 armored personnel carriers to the UN 
for its risky operations. 
  [Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 0500 GMT 
on 4 June 94 adds the following: "President Nelson Mandela has 
returned from his first official visit to a foreign country. 
President Mandela, who attended a meeting of the Frontline 
States in Harare, lauded the Frontline States for their role in 
the dismantling of apartheid."]

  [Text] The Frontline States met in Harare yesterday and 
noted that explosive situations still prevail in southern 
Africa. As a solution, the meeting called for continued 
consultations and joint efforts by the countries in the region.

  [Text] Harare June 3 SAPA -- The Global Coalition for 
Africa (GCA) Advisory Committee meeting ended in Harare on 
Friday [3 June] with a call to African countries to intensify 
efforts to reform their ailing economies and improve living 
standards on the world's poorest continent, Zimbabwe's national 
news agency Ziana reports. Officially closing the two-day 
meeting, Botswana president Sir Ketumile Masire said African 
countries should be responsible for their economic development. 
Sir Ketumile said the meeting recognised the responsibility of 
improving governance lay with the African countries themselves. 
The Botswana president, co-chairman of GCA, said African 
governments should consult their people in policy formulation 
and implementation in order to have good governance. 
  The meeting was attended by a number of heads of state, 
including President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, President Sam 
Nujoma of Namibia and South African President Nelson Mandela. 
The meeting endorsed the concept of a new partnership between 
donors and African countries in which African countries should 
"take charge" of their economies. 
  "African countries should take charge of assuming the 
responsibility for determining both the priorities for 
development co-operation and also the nature of support which is 
required," President Masire said. "Both African countries and 
donors stressed the need for dialogue and for two-way 
communication. A number of donor countries indicated that a 
change of perspective, away from donor-driven programmes, to a 
broad-based approach providing support to strategies defined by 
recipient governments, had taken place." 
  The meeting agreed that Africa needed to mobilise its 
domestic resources, both financial and human. It endorsed the 
once-and-for- all debt restructuring to sustainable levels for 
each African country, and donors were urged to review their debt 
policies along those lines.

  [Text] Tunis June 5 SAPA -- Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred 
Nzo on Saturday [4 June] outlined South Africa's foreign policy, 
saying it would be based on "a solid domestic policy of national 
reconciliation". Addressing the Organisation of African Unity in

furthermore, be founded on a commitment to: human rights; the 
"promotion of freedom and democracy thoughout the world"; 
justice and international law; international peace and 
internationally agreed mechanisms for conflict resolution; 
promote the interests of Africa in global affairs; "expanded 
co-operation in an interdependent world". 
  A summary of his speech sent to SAPA also noted the

Government would be ready to supply "all forms of humanitarian 
assistance wherever possible". 
  On the Middle East, the SA foreign minister said he "viewed 
with concern the renewed Israeli aggression against Lebanon".

  [Excerpts] Kigali, June 3 (AFP) -- Rebels closing on the 
government seat in southern Rwanda captured a nearby town as 
United Nations forces came under fire while evacuating civilians 
from battle zones in Kigali Friday [3 June]. 
  The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) seized the town of 
Kabgayi, five kilometres (three miles) south of government 
headquarters at Gitarama Thursday, UN officials said. 
  A mortar shell meanwhile slammed into a market in a 
government-held area of Kigali Friday, killing at least four 
people and wounding about 50, Red Cross officials said. They 
expressed fears that the death toll might be much higher. The 
shell was presumably fired by the rebels, UN officials said. 
  The capture of Kabgayi, about 45 kilometres (27 miles) south 
of the embattled capital, marked a further advance by the mainly 
Tutsi rebels against the battered and demoralised forces of the 
Hutu government, which fled to Gitarama two months ago as ethnic 
carnage engulfed the capital. Witnesses said pro-government 
militiamen had taken out and massacred about 500 Tutsis and Hutu 
opposition supporters last weekend from the Kabgayi monastery, 
where 35,000 displaced people are sheltering. The rebels may 
have stepped up their advance on the town to stop the killings, 
UN officials said. [passage omitted] 
  A UN team sent to Kabgayi this week to investigate the 
reports of mass slaughter said there had been killings, but not 
on the scale first believed. Relief officials, however, cast 
doubt on their conclusions. UN officials said privately that 
the fact that the observers were escorted by government soldiers 
when they visited Kabgayi may have intimidated witnesses to the 
killings whom they interviewed at the monastery. 
  The rebels have also cut the government's possible escape 
route south from Gitarama to the town of Butare, which they have 
also captured, according to unconfirmed reports. "They're 
getting closer to Gitarama every day," a UN military observer 
said. 
  UN officials say the well-disciplined rebels are advancing 
steadily, but that fighting may drag on for a long time. 
  UN soldiers meanwhile came under fire Friday while trying to 
evacuate civilians trapped behind hostile lines despite promises 
of safety from the rebels and the army, a UN spokesman said. 
  It was the first humanitarian operation in Kigali since 
fighting forced the UN to suspend food distribution and 
evacuations four days ago. 
  A convoy ferrying civilians to government-held territory 
from 
the Amahoro stadium behind rebel lines was shot at while driving 
through the notoriously dangerous Kadhafi Crossing on Kigali's 
northwestern outskirts, UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy 
Plante said. Nobody was hurt. "The convoy made it through, 
dropped off the civilians, and was then shot at again on the way 
back," Plante told reporters. Plante said further evacuations 
and food distribution had been suspended until both sides 
guaranteed security. 
  "Discussions have been held today with both sides, mainly 
the 
(rebel) RPF, and we are expecting an explanation from the RPF 
commander," Plante said. 
  The shooting came a day after rebel and army commanders 
meeting for UN-mediated truce talks promised to cooperate with 
the UN in humanitarian operations. 
  Another convoy meanwhile safely delivered 180 civilians 
stranded in Kigali's Sainte-Famille church, where up to 8,000 
displaced people are encamped in squalor, to the rebel-held town 
of Kabuga, about 15 kilometres (nine miles) east of the capital. 
The army has repeatedly accused the rebels of firing at 
evacuation convoys. 
  The UN has ferried about two thousand civilians to safety in 
Kigali, but thousands more are still trapped with little food or 
water. 
  Thirty-one seriously wounded children were to be flown to 
Nairobi Saturday and then on to France for medical treatment, 
Plante said. "This is one of the first evacuations of children 
and we hope to see many more," he said.

  [Text] We have just received a report to the effect that 
the Rwandese Government says its forces have pushed back rebel 
RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] forces, who launched an attack on 
the town of Gitarama yesterday, after overrunning the nearby 
town of Kabgayi. Gitarama is reported to be heavily fortified, 
and observers say any assault on it will not be an easy task.

  [Text] Kigali, June 5 (AFP) -- The United Nations suspended 
relief flights to Rwanda after government forces shelled 
Kigali's rebel-held airport Sunday [5 June] while a plane 
carrying Italian Junior Foreign Minister Franco Rochetta was on 
the tarmac, officials said. 
  The flights were suspended "until further notice," the 
officials said. 
  A Canadian C-130 military transport plane that had just 
landed with Rochetta and three other Italian officials on board 
took off again before they could disembark after a shell slammed 
into the airport behind the control tower. 
  Seconds after the plane left the ground, a second shell hit 
the runway. Nobody was hurt and there was no damage to the 
plane. 
  "The shells were certainly fired by the RGF (Rwandan 
Government Forces)," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante 
told reporters on the tarmac when the shells landed.

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] chairman, 
Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, held a press conference yesterday at 
Mulindi RPF headquarters in northern Rwanda. The press 
conference was attended by foreign journalists from Italy and 
Australia. [passage omitted] The RPF chairman condemned the 
Rwandan leaders for promoting the killings through their 
preaches, newspapers and government-controlled radios. He 
estimated the people who have been killed so far in a period of 
only two months to be close to 1 million.

  [Excerpts] It is worth noting that at a time when the 
international community is trying to assist Rwanda, it is to be 
regretted that the Egyptian Government continues to support the 
Rwandan Government clique which plunged the whole country into 
bloodshed. The Egyptian Government recently allowed Rwandan 
leaders to purchase 33 tonnes of arms, worth $765,000, as 
specified in a fax dated 25 May 1994 from Cairo, from the second 
secretary of the Rwandan Embassy to Egypt, Mr. (Jean-Baptiste 
Vikamira Baviri), to Defense Minister Augustin Bizimungu. 
[passage omitted] 
  Most of the weapons used by the Rwandan Government are from 
Egypt, France, and South Africa, the apartheid South Africa. It 
is worth noting that today, democratic and nonsegregationist 
South Africa has made a positive change, as expected. Instead 
of backing a regime of butchers in Kibungo, Kibuye, or else in 
Gitarama, for it is no longer in Gitarama that the government is 
headquartered, South Africa agrees to provide humanitarian 
assistance [sentence as heard]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kinshasa, 5 Jun (AFP) -- Kibassa Maliba, president 
of the Zairian Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, USOR, 
today severely criticized France's position in Zaire. He 
accused France of "supporting the dictatorship" of President 
Mobutu. Mr. Maliba, accompanied by Etienne Tshisekedi, the main 
Zairian opposition leader, was taking part in a mammoth rally 
organized by the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, UDPS, 
the first radical opposition party, to which both belong. 
  Mr. Tshisekedi "warned" Marshal Mobutu to sign the decree 
appointing him the new prime minister of Zaire, otherwise 
threatening to call on diamond producers to embark on an 
indefinite strike. 
  Mr. Tshisekedi is a native of the Kasai-oriental region (in 
central Zaire), the main diamond producing region of the 
country, whose production currently represents the main source 
of revenue for the country.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There has been a big rally in the center of Zaire's 
capital, Kinshasa, today of the opposition UDPS [Union for 
Democracy and Social Progress] party. It was addressed by its 
leader, Etienne Tshisekedi -- the first time he has made such a 
big public appearance in a long time. He comes as the tussle 
over the prime minister's post drags on interminably. 
Tshisekedi says he is the legitimate premier. President Mobutu 
won't hear of it, and there is a split in the opposition 
alliance, the Sacred Union, with some parties deserting 
Tshisekedi and putting up their own candidates. Chris Green 
asked journalist Mikheli Ron in Kinshasa what the atmosphere has 
been like at today's rally: 
  [Begin recording] [Ron] I mean, it was an atmosphere of 
great 
enthusiasm, very cheerful. There were probably about 20,000 
people in all, and they crammed into the botanical gardens -- 
which is in the center of Kinshasa. There were people waving 
green bands, which is the usual sign of victory and peace, and a 
lot of people had to climb up into trees to get a glimpse of the 
stage. Women were taking off their rags and laying them down on 
the floor to form a ceremonial carpet for Tshisekedi to walk on 
as he came into the botanical gardens. 
  [Green] So it seems they gave him a fairly extravagant 
welcome? 
  [Ron] He got a very enthusiastic reception. He always does, 
but he hasn't actually been seen in public for quite a while. 
The last big crowd event was when his mother died, and there 
were a lot of people who turned up for her funeral, but he 
hadn't actually spoken in public for the last three months. 
  [Green] And what did he say today? 
  [Ron] His message was, as ever, that he remains the prime 
minister of Zaire and expects to be reconfirmed by President 
Mobutu. He appealed to President Mobutu to approve his position 
as the prime minister, to sign the decree that would make that 
legal, and he said that if this doesn't happen he is willing to 
call for a general strike in the state's diamond mining company, 
the MIBA [Bakwanga Mining Company], and he said that now that 
the copper mining industry, Gecamines [General Quarries and 
Mines Company], has virtually closed down, this would obviously 
bring the whole of Zaire's economy grinding to a halt, and 
that.... 
  [Green, interrupting] Is that actually a credible threat on 
his part? 
  [Ron] I think it is credible, in that if he were to launch 
that kind of call he might well get a response. Yes, I think he 
does have that kind of popular support. 
  [Green] Did Tshisekedi have anything to say about relations 
among the parties opposing Mobutu? 
  [Ron] Well, relations are extremely strained at the moment 
between his UDPS party and some centrist opposition parties that 
are fielding their own candidates for the post of prime 
minister. Last week France, Belgium, and the United States sent 
their diplomats to his house to ask him to reopen talks with 
those parties. Today, he wasn't being very conciliatory. He 
basically said that those parties are welcome to come back into 
the fold, but they will have to show solid signs of good faith 
before they will be accepted. He did not really.... 
  [Green, interrupting] Solid signs of good faith presumably 
means full support for Tshisekedi? 
  [Ron] I think that is what he means. He certainly wasn't 
showing any signs of compromise. [end recording]

  [Text] A demonstration in the Afar District of Arhiba was 
violently repressed by police this morning, who used tear gas 
and real bullets. According to medical sources, two people are 
believed to have been killed, and several are reported to have 
been wounded. The demonstrators are protesting against the 
police, who for several days now have been destroying wooden 
houses sheltering people displaced by war. About 10 days ago, 
similar clashes led to the deaths of two people.

  [Excerpts] In Djibouti, a demonstration in the Afar 
district of Arhiba was violently repressed by the police this 
morning. [passage omitted] 
  Djama Elabe, the chairman of the Party for Democratic 
Renewal, is outraged at what happened. He has condemned the 
intervention of the police. Listen to him: 
  [Begin Djama Elabe recording] Under the pretext of 
dislodging 
people from anarchic [as heard] buildings, the government today 
used what I would call provocation. They used tanks; they used 
an entire army. They dislodged these people. As you know, most 
of these people are people who have been displaced because of 
war. They came from Obock. They live near this district. 
  Instead of solving the problems and helping people to settle 
in a home again and restoring peace, tanks and the army are sent 
to dislodge people and we strongly condemn what happened today. 
Many people were wounded. We have even been told that people 
had died. 
  We condemn the attitude of the government which is currently 
losing control. Over the last few days, we have witnessed 
attitudes....[pauses] It really seems that the government is 
experiencing physical fear because everything is getting out of 
hand. They have destroyed the country politically, 
economically, socially, and it now seems that they are 
destroying men and women as well. It is in order to hide their 
political failure, in order to restore hatred between people, 
and to divide our people. [end recording] 
  That was Djama Elabe. It must also be pointed out that the 
chairman of the United Djibouti Opposition Front, Mohamed Ahmed 
Issa, also known as Cheiko, was arrested at his home this 
evening.

  [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi has 
postponed the meeting originally scheduled for 6th of this month 
to deliberate on possible ways of restoring lasting peace in 
Rwanda. In a statement issued from State House, Nakuru, 
President Moi said the postponement became necessary as 
confirmation of attendance had not been received by today from 
some invited heads of state. Those invited are President Yoweri 
Museveni of Uganda, Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Mobutu Sese 
Seko of Zaire and acting President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya of 
Burundi. 
  He said the postponement would enable him and his colleagues 
to consult a little more to ensure that all of them attend any 
such meeting. The head of state reiterated that the problem of 
Rwanda was complicated and therefore required concerted efforts 
of all the neighboring of heads of state so that decisions 
reached might stand a better chance of success. 
  At the same time President Moi appealed to all the 
combatants 
in Rwanda to start and observe a cease-fire to avoid any more 
loss of life. He also observed that failure to take this course 
of action would mean that the leaders have no value for the 
lives of their people.

  [Text] Accra, June 3 (AFP) -- Ghana Friday [3 June] called 
on the international community to help end the "carnage" in 
Rwanda by putting pressure on the warring factions there, a 
Foreign Ministry communique said here. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibn Chambas told parliament 
that the belligerents must accept "the full implementation of UN 
resolutions" calling for a ceasefire in the two-month civil war. 
  Ghana along with Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal and Zimbabwe is 
ready to send more peacekeeping troops to Rwanda, he said but 
did not give an exact figure. 
  Ghana has already sent 321 troops to Rwanda as part of the 
UN 
Assistance Mission there. 
  Up to 500,000 people have died in the Rwandan civil war 
since 
April 6.

  [Text] Once again, the conflict in Liberia seems to be 
spilling across the border into neighboring Guinea. Some months 
ago there were clashes on the Guinea side of the border 
involving rival factions and ethnic groups fighting each other 
in Liberia. There has been a fresh attack and a lot of 
civilians have died. From Conakry, Foday Fofana telexed this 
report: 
  Intelligence sources here said that the Lofa Defense Force, 
LDF, which is fighting ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia] in Liberia's Upper Lofa County, has 
launched an attack on the Guinean border town of Koyama, near 
Zozo District. At least 30 civilians are thought to have died 
in the attack. According to reports reaching Conakry today from 
the town of Macenta, LDF rebels crossed into Guinea on Wednesday 
[1 June] night and used automatic weapons in their attack. 
Details of this assault are so far scanty and a team of 
investigators from the Interior Ministry is expected to travel 
to the area. 
  If this week's attack is proved to be the work of the LDF, 
the movement will lose a lot of sympathy in Guinea, despite the 
support it currently enjoys here from members of the Toma tribe. 
Guinea closed all land borders with Liberia last year following 
what was thought to be a ULIMO crossborder attack, which 
resulted in the death of many Guinean civilians. Last year's 
incursion sparked off vengeance attacks between the (Koniyakis) 
who side with ULIMO and the Tomas who join forces with the LDF.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Liberia's Transitional Assembly [TA] flexed its 
muscles this week, and called on the rival factions to come 
before it and explain why they were still fighting each other, 
and why the disarmament process was in disarray and at a virtual 
standstill. There have been continuing battles between rival 
wings of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia], with Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces driven out of 
their headquarters at Tubmaburg by Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn 
troops. Flare-ups have continued between Charles Taylor's NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the Armed Forces of 
Liberia, AFL, and the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and the UN are increasingly 
exasperated. Well, the factions did send representatives to the 
TA yesterday, and it seems some were eager to shift the blame. 
From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: 
  At the meeting were Alhaji Koromah, leader of ULIMO's 
Mandingo faction; Hezekiah Bowen, chief of the AFL; and John 
Richardson, who was representing Charles Taylor's NPFL. 
Richardson told the assembly that the reluctance to disarm is a 
result of the failure of the transition government to assert 
itself in Liberia. General Bowen of the AFL said his fighters 
were delaying disarmament due to advancement on their positions 
by the NPFL, especially in the Harbel area. He said the AFL is 
ready to disarm as soon as the NPFL withdraws to its original 
positions. Alhaji Koromah said the ongoing war between the 
Krahn and Mandingo factions of ULIMO was preventing his fighters 
from laying down their arms. 
  Meanwhile, for the first time since the ULIMO conflict broke 
out, the leader of the Krahn faction, Roosevelt Johnson, has 
travelled out of Monrovia to Tubmanburg. ULIMO's Krahn faction 
captured Tubmanburg from the Mandingo faction a few days ago. 
Johnson is expected to set up an administrative structure in 
Tubmanburg. UN sources here confirm that Johnson's motorcade 
drove into the city amidst cheers from his Krahn fighters. A 
local journalist who travelled with Johnson said bodies littered 
the outskirts of the city. He said the city center was 
completely deserted, and that homes of Alhaji Koromah and some 
of his key commanders had been blown up by rocket-propelled 
grenades.

  [Text] Lagos, 3 Jun (AFP) -- Members of the House of 
Representatives, dissolved by the military authorities, today 
called on General Sani Abacha to relinquish power "by 11 June." 
The call was made in a communique issued at the end of a 
meeting attended by 348 members. 
  The 11 June deadline was chosen because it is the eve of the 
first anniversary of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections 
annulled by the military. 
  The results of these elections are expected to be announced 
and the winner sworn into office to form a broad-based national 
government, the communique stated. It also indicated that the 
number of delegates at the meeting was sufficient for the 
necessary quorum to be attained. 
  "The meeting came to the irrevocable conclusion that the 
current military junta lacks the necessary spirit or wisdom to 
move the country forward," the communique added.

  [Text] Senator Bola Tinubu told AFP this morning that the 
government has arrested more opposition figures, among whom was 
Chief Olusegun Osoba, the former civilian governor of Ogun State 
in the Southwest of Nigeria. Several other persons were 
arrested in the eastern and southwestern parts of the country 
and "we are currently trying to discover their names and 
numbers," he added. 
  Senator Bola Tinubu is one of the founding members of the 
opposition National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which called 
on Nigerians to take their destiny into their own hands by 
restoring democracy to the country. Senate Chairman Ameh Ebute 
was arrested on 2 June by security forces, following similar 
calls. 
  Senator Tinubu took part in a Senate meeting after which its 
president published a communique calling for the formation of a 
government of national unity and reconciliation, led by the 
"president-elect" Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of 
the 12 June 1993 presidential election, which was canceled by 
the military. 
  Yesterday, members from the dissolved House of 
Representatives also published a communique, which called for 
Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha to relinquish power 
"at the latest by 11 June," in order to enable the winner of the 
12 June 1993 elections to form a "broad-based" national 
government on the first anniversary of that election. 
  General Oladipo Diya, the reegime's number two man, 
yesterday 
stated that the Senate president's call was "illegal," and 
constituted a "violation of the law." "What responsible 
government would sit with its arms folded in the face of 
individuals flouting the laws with impunity? (...) To do so 
would be tantamount to encouraging chaos," the press quoted Gen. 
Diya as saying. According to the pro-government DAILY TIMES, 
Ameh Ebute is expected to be arraigned before a court on 6 June, 
and could be charged with treason. 
  Moshood Abiola also claimed to have learned with "shock" the 
arrest of the Senate president. The billionaire Yoruba Muslim, 
whose statement was reported by the press, said: "To arrest the 
country's legitimate, elected representatives, simply because 
they called for respecting the people's aspirations for 
(democracy) is a criminal act." Mr. Abiola added: "The (ruling) 
junta, which continues to subjugate our people and denigrate the 
expression of their sovereign will through diversions, cannot 
escape the imminent judgment of history." 
  A former head of state, General Olusegun Obasanjo, 
(1976-1979), who is widely respected in Nigeria, said he had 
known Abiola "since being in school with him, and I am not in 
favor of his taking power. I do not think Abiola is the Messiah 
we are expecting," declared Gen. Obasanjo, whose statement was 
reported by the press.

  [Text] Lagos, June 5 (APF) - Two more former senators have 
been arrested and a third is still wanted by the police in a 
continued government crackdown on opposition leaders, one of the 
detainees told AFP Sunday [5 June] from his detention room here. 
  "I came here yesterday (Saturday) to see former Senate 
president Ameh Ebute who has been in detention here since last 
Thursday. On getting here, I introduced myself to the security 
agents who immediately detained me," Polycarp Nwite said 
speaking on his cellular phone. 
  Former senator Okoroafor was also arrested Saturday in 
Abeokuta, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of here, while the 
police are looking for Bola Tinubu, another outspoken member of 
the senate who last week declared the rule of junta leader 
General Sani Abacha "illegal,", their colleagues told AFP. 
  The arrests came after members of the dissolved house of 
representatives called on Abacha to step down "not later than" 
June 11, the eve of the first anniversary of the annulled 
presidential election. 
  Tinubu is a founding member of the opposition National 
Democratic Coalition which has called on Nigerians to take the 
initiative in restoring democracy. 
  On Wednesday he attended a meeting of the dissolved senate 
following which Ebute issued a statement calling for the 
formation of a government of national unity and reconciliation 
headed by the presumed winner of last year's annulled elections, 
Chief Moshood Abiola.

  [Text] Lagos, June 5 (AFP) -- Some members of the dissolved 
National Assembly pledged here Sunday [5 June] to give 
"solidarity support" to detained former senate leader Ameh Ebute 
whenever he is brought to court for trial. 
  "He is our leader and he deserves our moral support in his 
moment of travail," four of the ex-legislators told AFP in a 
telephone interview. They did not disclose what form the 
support would take but said it would be demonstrated around the 
court premises. 
  At least three senators, including Ebute, who attended a 
meeting last Wednesday and issued a communique in which they 
declared "illegal" the government of General Sani Abacha, have 
been arrested. 
  Ex-senators Polycarp Nwite and Okoroafor were arrested and 
detained Saturday, respectively in Lagos and Abeokuta. 
  Nwite, who spoke to AFP Sunday from his detention room on 
his 
cellular phone, alleged that the conditions under which he was 
being held were harsh. He complained of non-provision of food, 
water and a bed to sleep on. 
  His colleagues in the dissolved senate, Bola Tinubu and O.J. 
Adewunmi, told AFP Sunday that they were also being sought by 
security agents who had paid several fruitless visits to their 
Lagos residences in the past 24 hours. 
  The arrest of the former legislators marked the beginning of 
a government clampdown on the opposition, including members of 
the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a recently-formed 
pro- democracy group, made up of prominent politicians, 
ex-ministers and state governors and retired military officers. 
  Like the legislators, the NADECO has called on General 
Abacha 
to quit office to pave the way for the installation of Moshood 
Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of last June's annulled 
presidential election. 
  Members of the House of Representatives who met last Friday 
asked General Abacha to quit "not later than" June 11, the eve 
of the first anniversary of the presidential election. 
  The government has described their action as "illegal, 
criminal and very dangerous." 
  The National Assembly, made up of the senate and the house 
of 
representatives, was dissolved last November, along with other 
democratic institutions, when General Abacha came to power.

  [Text] The Federal Government has declared illegal the 
proposed national industrial action planned for Thursday [9 
June] by some categories of employees of NEPA [National Electric 
Power Authority]. The minister of state for power and steel, 
Elder Wole Oyelese, told a Radio Nigeria Correspondent in Lagos 
that the proposed action was uncalled for. He explained that 
the employees were only out to create unnecessary problems for 
government. He reminded them that government will not hesitate 
to take drastic action against anyone who attempts to frustrate 
efforts aimed at installing peace and harmony in the country. 
The minister stated that everything has been done to forestall 
any disruption of electricity supply by unscrupulous elements.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mohamed Okorijo] </F>
  [Text] It is not too much to revisit the Bakassi problem 
every now and then. The truth is that the Bakassi crisis, which 
has embroiled Nigeria and Cameroon in a near-war situation, is 
now like a dormant volcano. Dangerous as this already is, it 
seems Cameroon is foolhardy enough to be playing with the tail 
of a sleeping cobra. We all know that this can result in the 
cobra asserting its self-defensive prowess. Besides, the 
Cameroonian press is not helping matters by not being objective 
and resorting to self-deception. 
  For instance, the press in Cameroon anticipates the 
withdrawal of Nigeria from Bakassi Peninsula as a result of what 
it perceives as sustained international pressure. They believe 
that the pullout is probably being delayed while Nigeria 
searches for a way to keep its prestige intact as giant of 
Africa. Well, this imagined international pressure is a figment 
of the imagination of the Cameroonian authorities because 
Nigeria feels no such pressure from any quarter. 
  The fact of Nigeria being the giant of Africa is not 
self-aggrandizement. The appellation was thrust on Nigeria by 
countries like Cameroon which had at one time or the other 
enjoyed enormous largess and support from Nigeria. It is a pity 
that the Cameroonian press is mounting a propaganda war that is 
giving it ego problems. 
  The truth is that the Biya administration is struggling 
against a dwindling reputation. The press is, therefore, 
offering Cameroonians a distraction. But the frustration of the 
populace will surely come back once the inebriation of the press 
propaganda wears off. 
  In spite of the heavy propaganda, mounted by Cameroon in 
international circles, its case is not progressing well. A good 
number of African countries, including Ghana and Guinea, have 
blamed Cameroon's threat antics over the Bakassi problem. In 
fact, President Rawlings of Ghana is not happy about the 
handling of the matter, particularly, at the ECOWAS [Economic 
Community of West African States] level. 
  He is known to have blamed President Soglo of Benin 
Republic, 
who is current chairman of ECOWAS, for allowing the 
Franco-Beninois military exercise at a time Nigeria was having 
problems with Cameroon. Although President Soglo apologized for 
his action, it is probably belated because his support for the 
French in their effort to intimidate Nigeria is what has given 
Cameroon the false security that has prolonged the dispute. 
Nigeria hopes that level-minded leaders like Rawlings will see 
the Bakassi dispute in its true perspective and openly call the 
bluff of France's Hitlerism. 
  While Cameroon is working hard to deceive the world about 
the 
real situation on the ground in Bakassi Peninsula, it is still 
massing French military support. Even as recently as mid-April, 
22 military vehicles and a cache of assorted arms and ammunition 
came into Cameroon from France to boost the already superfluous 
arsenals in the hands of Biya's unwilling soldiers. 
  But the truth is that the Bakassi topsy-turvy by Cameroon is 
a ploy to detract from a restive population. Even those who 
want a war do so because they want Biya's administration to be 
weakened so that they can have their way. Right now, the 
Bakassi campaign has embolden various movements to move from 
their desire for restoration of federalism to outright secession. 
  A forum known as All Anglophone Conference, an umbrella of 
many English-speaking groups, is spearheading the campaign. It 
has warned that unless the status quo in Cameroon is changed, 
secession is the alternative. But Paul Biya, ever so 
insensitive about the real problems of his countrymen and 
concerned only with his own personal interests, has other 
distractions. 
  At the time the morale of Cameroonian soldiers is very low 
with those from the north complaining that they were being 
deployed to Bakassi to be eliminated so as to reduce their 
population in the Army, Biya was more concerned with erotic 
pleasures. At 61, he married 24-year old (Chantal Bevgoron) 
last April and left immediately with her to Europe on honeymoon, 
leaving Cameroonians to wallow in the depression his Bakassi 
campaign has caused. 
  Well, Cameroonians now know better who their real enemy is 
because although Biya has fooled many of them most of the time, 
he cannot fool all of them all the time.

  [Text] Dakar, 3 Jun (AFP) -- Judicial sources have reported 
that the Dakar regional court yesterday found against the editor 
in chief of JEUNE AFRIQUE, who was tried in absentia, to a six 
months suspended prison term and 50 million CFA in damages for 
"defamation and insult." 
  In addition, the court itself fined Mr. Bechir Ben Yahmed 
200,000 CFA, and the court "banned the weekly from Senegal for 
one year." 
  The court's action followed complaints lodged against the 
paper by Mr. Mansour Tall, a magistrate and former permanent 
undersecretary to the minister of justice. Mr. Tall alleged 
that he was defamed by a JEUNE AFRIQUE article that appeared in 
October 1993. 
  JEUNE AFRIQUE had reported that Mr. Tall, the permanent 
undersecretary to the justice minister, was transferred as a 
technical adviser to the Ministry of Fisheries, after 
"attempting (in vain) to obtain information concerning the case" 
of the murder, in May 1993, of Constitutional Council Vice 
Chairman Babacar Seye. 
  The paper stressed that Mr. Tall was the brother of Aminata 
Tall, a Senegalese Democratic Party [PDS] parliamentarian. PDS 
leader Abdoulaye Wade and several other party officials have 
been charged with "complicity" in the "murder" case. 
  The public prosecution director's office of the Dakar Court 
of Appeals ruled in favor of the PDS officials in the case. 
However, the prosecutor general's department has appealed the 
verdict. 
  In a letter addressed to Senegalese President Abdou Diouf 
today, the Reporters Without Frontiers Association "considers 
that this sentence is totally incommensurate with the charges 
leveled against JEUNE AFRIQUE," stressing that "the sentences 
handed down are in violation of Senegalese press law." 
  In a communique, the Union of West African Journalists 
"strongly protests these sentences, notably, the one year ban on 
the publication." It considers the ban a measure "restraining 
the free flow of information...and constituting a dangerous 
precedent in a country which wants to be a model democracy."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Some reputable sources contacted by Angola Radio 
Nacional here in Lusaka, who asked to remain anonymous, feel 
that the latest offer made by the government, which has already 
been presented to the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA], reflects -- as has always been expressed by 
Angolan authorities -- the personal commitment of engineer Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos, president of the Republic, to reconciliation 
and national unity. 
  These sources also say that the government offer should not 
in any way be viewed as a weakness. On the contrary, they add, 
it should be viewed by UNITA and its leader Jonas Savimbi, who 
have claimed to be champions of peace and democracy, as a 
realistic and beneficial stand for the nation. The figures 
contacted by Angola Radio Nacional have called on the 
international community to pressure UNITA to end the bloody war 
that will have unforeseen consequences for the country. 
  Meanwhile, it is already known that, within the framework of 
the national sensitization campaign and pacification of hearts, 
the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel will continue to 
broadcast in short wave, as an exception, for about 260 days 
once a peace agreement is reached in Lusaka. After that date 
and in accordance with the legislation in force, the UNITA radio 
will become a depoliticized radio station, broadcasting in 
adequate frequencies to be accorded to it.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] A step forward was made here in Lusaka today. After 
15 days of discussions, the negotiating teams from the 
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] today reached an agreement on the future of the 
Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. Radio 
Vorgan will not close down but its officials will have to follow 
the legal procedures for its continued operation. There is a 
law in Angola and Vorgan will have to abide by it. 
  The negotiating teams have already begun discussions on the 
next issue -- the swearing in of UNITA deputies. The mediators 
have already presented to the negotiating teams from the 
government and UNITA the initial document on modalities for the 
swearing in of UNITA deputies. The government says it agrees 
with the document. UNITA has requested time to study it but it 
says it will give its reply tomorrow. 
  A meeting between the government and UNITA, to be attended 
by 
Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary 
general in Angola, and observers, has been scheduled for 
tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] After the conclusion of discussions on the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel yesterday, negotiators from the 
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] are now discussing the swearing in of UNITA 
deputies in Parliament. 
  It is known that UNITA deputies who are presently in 
Parliament face the risk of losing their seats to new elements 
trusted by that organization. This stand does not agree, 
however, with the law in force in the country. The mediators 
have presented a proposal which does not differ much from the 
government's views. It now remains to be seen what arguments 
the UNITA representatives will present on 6 June. 
  Angola Radio Nacional learned that mediator Alioune Blondin 
Beye has been holding contacts with UNITA men with a view to 
finding in advance an effective stance [words indistinct]. In 
brief, it was a day without substantial changes in the peace 
talks, despite appeals from the international community to speed 
up the process in order to end the war in the country and reduce 
the suffering of the people, particularly the less privileged.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces </F>
for the Liberation of Angola in Huambo on 3 June] 
  [Text] While efforts are under way in Lusaka to achieve 
peace in Angola, the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] is stepping up its nationwide 
offensive. The aim is to hinder the peace process. Of the 
various actions that have been carried out, the following are 
the most relevant: 
  Huambo Province: On 3 June 1994, the city of Huambo was once 
again bombed by two Su-22 formations at 1104 and at 1334. The 
aircraft dropped 16 napalm and phosphorous bombs, destroying 
several houses, and killing and wounding a large number of 
civilians. 
  Lunda Province: On 3 June 1994, two Su-22 formations bombed 
Canfunfo at 1105 and 1205, killing and wounding many people. In 
all those raids, the Luanda air force hit mainly hospitals, 
schools, and defenseless civilians. 
  Bie Province: On 2 and 3 June 1994, the MPLA-PT air force 
dropped bombs over its own defensive positions in the city of 
Bie [Cuito], killing and wounding many government troops and 
civilians. Intense clashes have been taking place in the city 
of Bie since 26 May 1994, when enemy forces once again violated 
the unilateral cease-fire declared by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] on 20 September 1993. 
  In view of all those provocations, UNITA has no option but 
to 
defend itself.

  [Text] Our Cabinda correspondent reports that UNITA's 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] armed 
forces in that province will not tolerate provocations by the 
government army. The correspondent says since mid-May, 
government forces have been involved in an offensive against 
positions of UNITA and the Front for the Liberation of the 
Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] in the northern part of the territory. 
The offensive has already claimed many innocent lives. 
  In a counteroffensive launched on 1 June, the Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] overran a People's Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] convoy moving from 
(Nicuma) to Buco Zau. At the end a four-hour fierce clash, 
FAPLA troops fled, leaving seven dead behind. Large quantities 
of war materiel, including four RPG-7's and three PKM machine 
guns were captured. In a separate incident, FALA destroyed a 
FAPLA motorized column moving from (Choa) in support of 
government forces in northern Cabinda. Nine FAPLA soldiers were 
killed and six vehicles burned. The survivors fled in disarray. 
  Meanwhile, latest reports from the city of Bie [Cuito] say 
artillery fire was exchanged last night. Light weapons were 
heard near government positions this morning. 
  No changes had been reported yesterday. MPLA-PT [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] fighter 
aircraft continued to bomb civilian targets, while FAPLA 
infantry units shelled wards controlled by UNITA in a failed 
attempt to break through UNITA defensive lines. Our 
correspondent reports that decomposed corpses of government 
soldiers are scattered on the roads of Bie. MPLA-PT troops are 
using UN relief food earmarked for civilians.

  [Text] Jonas Savimbi's men have bit the red dust of this 
bloody land as they tried to take the martyred city of Cuito by 
storm at dawn today. Those who sow the wind, reap the 
whirlwind. UNITA today got what it deserved. UNITA left 
several dead bodies behind as others fled in disarray. Today's 
clashes were the fiercest since the start of the hostilities on 
26 May. 
  Military sources with the Angolan Armed Forces Operational 
Command in Bie Province said this morning that UNITA rebels, who 
are still in the outlaying areas of the city, continue to 
receive reinforcements for yet another attack on Cuito. As we 
file this report, clashes are still in progress and UNITA 
continues to shell the city. One cannot yet take stock of the 
human and material losses of the past 24 hours. 
  In view of the unstable military situation, Belgium's 
Doctors 
Without Borders and Mr. (Hans Peter), a World Food Program 
official, left the city of Cuito for Luanda this morning. Mr. 
(Dominic Henry), delegate of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross for Bie Province, refused to leave the city.

already lost more than 100 men. The clashes have been 
intensifying day by day and it is still not yet known when peace

Legua, Camenongue, Cangandala, Cangola, and Capenda Camulemba. 
The victims were all civilians: 103 people were killed and 341 
others wounded on 4 and 5 June. The General Staff once more

consequences of the current escalation of violence for which 
only the government of Eduardo dos Santos is to blame.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] According to the Angolan Government, there has been 
the fiercest fighting yet around Cuito since the flare up of the 
conflict 10 days ago. UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] rebels have been launching offensives at 
Cuito and Malanje, while the government has been bombing UNITA 
headquarters at Huambo. Aid flights have been interrupted and 
the civilian death toll is already well into the hundreds. 
  Well, today, a flight made it to Cuito and came back with a 
number of relief workers being evacuated from the city. World 
Food Program Director in Angola Philip Borel was on the plane. 
On the line to Luanda, Chris Greene asked him what the relief 
workers had said about the situation in Cuito over the past few 
days. 
  [Begin recording] [Borel] Well, the situation is very bad. I 
can't say nothing more than that. It is extremely bad. 
  [Greene] Could they give any impression of the number of 
people who have been killed? 
  [Borel] It is very difficult to give statistics when you are 
most of the time in a bunker. 
  [Greene] You say they spent most of their time in a bunker. 
Does that mean that the shelling was more or less continuous for 
the last few days? 
  [Borel] Correct. Even last night and even in the morning. 
  [Greene] So, it is still going on? 
  [Borel] Yes, yes. We are very concerned. 
  [Greene] Do you see any possibility of being able to get 
relief flights into Cuito in the near future? 
  [Borel] I think it is extremely premature to say anything 
before the political arm of the United Nations has indicated to 
us that we may resume the flights. 
  [Greene] Are your people who have just come out of Cuito 
able 
to tell you anything about the food situation there? 
  [Borel] Yes, sure. The food situation is terrible. Mr. Hans 
Peter Vicola who is our [word indistinct] manager in Cuito has 
done a beautiful job. He has himself made the latest 
distribution on Monday and after that, since a bomb fell on our 
warehouse, we have no more food to distribute; but according to 
his information, we may have maybe one week of spare food for 
all the population and after that, there will be [words 
indistinct] survive. 
  [Greene] How many people had WFP been feeding up there? 
  [Borel] More or less 160,000. 
  [Greene] So, basically the entire population? 
  [Borel] That is correct. You see, they have no other link 
[words indistinct] our flights. 
  [Greene] What information have you had today about the 
situation in other parts of Angola? 
  [Borel] I think the situation is bad in Malanje again. We 
have not resumed a flight to Malanje. The situation is still 
difficult in Huambo. We have resumed a flight to Huambo. The 
situation in the north also is quite tense and we have not 
resumed a flight. Everywhere else [words indistinct] normally. 
  [Greene] What does normal mean in that kind of context? 
  [Borel] Normal means that we have flights without problems 
to 
Luena, Saurimo, Menongue, and [words indistinct] corridors, from 
Namibe, Lubango, Ndjiva, and from Lobito to Cubal, and a lot of 
other places. Yesterday, we succeeding a [words indistinct] to 
Dundo. [end recording]

  [Text] The Angolan authorities have accused Zaire of siding 
with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] in the Angola war. They described Zaire's involvement 
as aggression. The accusation comes in the wake of warnings 
made by the UN Security Council to Angola's warring factions. 
The Angolan Government says Zaire has been violating the UN 
Security Council's sanctions on UNITA, particularly the supply 
of military equipment and fuel. The Zairian ambassador in 
Luanda says there (?is not) enough evidence to prove that Zaire 
is assisting UNITA. The Angolan Government has invited a UN 
commission of inquiry to visit northern Angola to draw its 
conclusions.

  [Text] For some time now a lot of attention has been paid 
to the presence of so-called South African mercenaries in 
Angola. The soldiers are assisting in the training of MPLA 
[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] soldiers. An 
international news team succeeded in visiting one of the 
controversial training camps, and Nan Roux has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Roux] These soldiers are former members 
of 
the South African Special Forces, a special unit within the 
South African Defense Force. They have already been in Angola 
for a year now and are involved in the training of their former 
enemy, the Angolan Government, the MPLA. Many see them as 
mercenaries but they do not agree with this. They insist that 
they are not fighting the war for the Angolan Government, but 
that they are merely helping the MPLA soldiers to fight their 
own war more effectively. 
  [Executive Outcomes official Karl Deats, in English] 
...already, that our function over here comprises a couple of 
things, first of all, in an advisory ... in an advisory 
capacity. Secondly, in a socioeconomic assistance role, and 
then the main function that we had over here is to conduct 
training. 
  [Roux] The South Africans have three training camps in 
Angola: in the country's diamond province, Lunda Sul, as well as 
south of the capital Luanda. The camps are used for the 
training of new troops. The soldiers are instructed in basic 
techniques, such as weapons maintenance, radio signals, and 
fighting techniques. The South Africans originally entered 
Angola under the name of a South African company, Executive 
Outcomes. The company was approached by oil companies to 
protect their installations in Angola. No one knows how long 
the South Africans will remain in Angola, but according to 
Executive Outcomes this will depend on the Angolan Government 
and their success in the battle against UNITA [National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama at a meeting of </F>
opposition parties in Xai-Xai, Gaza Province, on 26 May; 
published as an advertisement] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, compatriots, 
  I would like to begin by saluting you during this first 
meeting of opposition political parties being held in this 
atmosphere of peace and national reconciliation that we all wish 
to see. 
  This is a period of national reconciliation, after years of 
grief, struggle, and suffering that we all experienced. We 
stand for reconciliation during this period of peace and 
consolidation of democracy. 
  Democracy: my dream, the dream of all of us! 
  Each and every process of national reconciliation signifies 
the establishment of a government of national unity. This 
results from the idea that what unites political forces of a 
government of national unity is far greater than what separates 
them. 
  In our case, some of the reasons that would lead us to 
establish such a government are very clear. 
  Our first objective is to guarantee the holding of free 
elections to establish democracy in Mozambique. 
  We know who the democrats are. We also know who the other 
people are who have been in power for the past 19 years! 
  We are not dealing with a question of party strength. What 
is at stake is not the fact that the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] is stronger than other opposition parties. 
This cannot and should not raise doubts about our intentions. 
  Through its positions, Renamo has demonstrated deep respect 
for all political forces since, I repeat, what is at stake is 
the defense of democratic values, social justice, and solidarity 
-- values which our people have not known and do not know in 
practice. 
  All of us present here are very aware of the needs and 
difficulties facing our people in their daily lives. We all 
want to change this situation, by imposing justice and 
democratic legality, fighting abuse of power and corruption, and 
creating a new society. 
  We want to create a new society where economic and social 
development will receive priority with a view to establishing, 
from October, a better life for all Mozambicans and creating 
foundations for progress, our future concern. 
  If all the problems that we face concern us and bring us 
closer, then the only thing that remains is for us to combine 
our strength through the establishment of a government of 
national unity to find a solution to the needs facing our people. 
  Our disunity can only benefit others, notably the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo], which has always involved itself in 
divisive maneuvers to continue ruling, which has always created 
a gap between the privileged and the persecuted, a party which 
has distanced itself from the country's reality, from our people. 
  Frelimo finds itself lost in this new model of society to 
create true democracy. 
  The new Frelimo democrats are the old Frelimo Marxists. 
Their methods and production have not changed: Mozambique's 
backwardness and increasing difficulties facing our people. 
  As far as Frelimo is concerned, the existence of many 
parties 
standing for elections is a good thing, because its strategy is 
to safeguard votes that it is sure of obtaining from the few 
supporters of the Marxist policy under the disguise of democracy. 
  Its aim is to see the votes of the rest of the electorate 
divided among the many political parties, making difficult the 
emergence of a party with absolute or relative majority, thus 
creating compromises that would thwart democratic values. 
  Friends, we cannot forget that Frelimo is well acquainted 
with electoral mechanisms, it has immense financial resources 
and an electoral machinery capable of all tricks, since it has 
been in power for the past 19 years in a single party 
dictatorship. 
  In the coming elections there are many presidential 
candidates, but we all know, however, that there will only be 
one president! 
  The issue now is for us to decide whether this president 
should be a democrat or whether we want to continue with a 
"make-believe democrat" whom we all know as Chissano. 
  Brothers, when I present myself to the electorate, I do not 
do so merely as a Renamo candidate appointed during a special 
congress of our party. 
  I want to be and I will be a candidate of democracy who 
represents and defends the people, regardless of their political 
creed. 
  It has not been in vain that I have been defending solutions 
that lead to national reconciliation. I will not distinguish 
between winners and losers, and once again the best solution is 
the establishment of a government of national unity. 
  What distinguishes us from Frelimo is that if Joaquim 
Chissano remains president of the Republic he will continue to 
be the president of a section of society pitted against another, 
whereas a democrat will be the president of all, without 
exception or discrimination of a political, social, economic, 
religious, or ethnic nature. 
  That is what democracy, for which I have fought so much, 
means to me! 
  Thus, I have always supported the existence of a financial 
fund for the electoral campaign to enable us to carry out our 
electoral campaigns with some financial backing that we have 
been lacking so far. 
  The agreement that we may reach will enable us to reinforce 
control mechanisms at the level of voter registration, which is 
a decisive step in the electoral process. 
  If we do not take all precautions in order to jointly ensure 
complete neutrality and transparency in this process, then all 
other following phases of the electoral process will be 
jeopardized. 
  Our joint monitoring will include the tight control of "vote 
counting," the use of data systems that assess and inform us 
about the use of computers, and the invitation we will make to 
those countries that form part of the UN Operations in 
Mozambique to form a group of electoral observers. 
  Although provisions have been made for the establishment of 
"mobile voter registration centers," the same is not the case 
regarding the ballot boxes. This will evidently create 
difficulties for the people deep in the interior. It will be up 
to us to guarantee their movement to polling stations. 
  Once again, the government and Frelimo -- which is one and 
the same thing -- obtained the approval of an electoral law 
favorable to them. 
  It is not only important to guarantee security in voter 
registration centers, it is also vital to guarantee security 
during the entire electoral process. 
  I am referring to the security of our candidates and our 
electorate. This will only be possible through the assistance 
of the police, which is neutral and depoliticized. 
  Together, we must demand the reinforcement of the National 
Commission for Police Affairs and the Civpol [UN Civilian Police 
Force] at national level to prevent incidents of insecurity and 
conflict which would certainly jeopardize the whole process now 
under way. 
  I am convinced that together we shall be able to more easily 
overcome all the difficulties that lie ahead. Some of these 
difficulties are already known to us and we shall be cautious. 
  Brothers, we shall certainly experience other unforeseen 
difficulties, however -- constant surprises, provocation after 
provocation -- that jeopardize the process for which many people 
gave their lives and many more are willing to work tirelessly 
and sacrifice their lives. 
  I am convinced that the challenge before us today, to form a 
government of national unity, is a decisive step forward toward 
victory by the democratic forces. 
  [Signed] Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama

<F P=106> [Final communique issued by the multiparty conference in </F>
Xai-Xai 25-27 May] 
  [Text] The first conference of opposition political parties 
was held in the city of Xai-Xai, Gaza Province, from 25 to 27 
May 1994. The conference had the following agenda: 
  a) October 1994 elections 
  b) Electoral guarantees 
  The meeting amounted to a notable change in the relations 
among the various opposition political parties, and it stressed 
the will to overcome political and ideological differences with 
a view to forming a common platform. Although the meeting was 
not designed to make deliberations, important positions have 
been agreed upon regarding coalitions that the opposition could 
form for the presidential elections. 
  The participating parties unanimously stated their intention 
of rapidly continuing with the negotiations with a view to 
forming coalitions because they believe only united can they 
constitute a serious alternative to the present government. 
Likewise, the participating parties stated the desire to begin 
consultations and to reach agreement on the choice of a single 
opposition candidate for the presidential elections to prevent 
the division of votes and to ensure a greater probability of 
victory. 
  Regarding electoral guarantees, it was noted that there are 
objective situations that could endanger the electoral process 
-- namely, the impossibility of the opposition political parties 
to guarantee the deployment of monitors during the registration 
of voters and at polling and counting stations because the lack 
material and financial resources. Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] has been asked to fill this gap. 
  Another serious cause for concern are the guarantees for the 
physical security of voters and candidates in view of the 
frequent persecution and intimidation carried out by local 
Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] authorities. To fill this 
gap it was decided to establish a commission to monitor and 
report such undemocratic actions. 
  A commission was also established to begin contacts with the 
National Elections Commission, the UN Operations in Mozambique, 
and the international community with a view to facilitating the 
release of funds necessary for the electoral process. 
  The conference unanimously rejected the use of computers for 
data processing and opted for a manual system, which is less 
susceptible to fraud and not as expensive.

  [Text] President Joaquim Chissano has pledged to meet fully 
the demands made by the 16,000 soldiers the government 
demobilized in June 1993, eight months after the signing of the 
General Peace Accord. SAVANA reports the former soldiers feel 
they were treated differently from other troops demobilized from 
assembly areas. They are demanding the payment of 18 months of 
salaries [words indistinct], pension, and what they regard as 
perks given to other demobilized troops. SAVANA says Chissano 
made the pledge at a meeting held in Maputo on 13 May with a 
commission representing the 16,000 demobilized soldiers. 
  The demobilized soldiers say if their demands are not met 
they will destroy business centers owned by Mozambican 
officials, boycott the 25 June and 25 September celebrations, 
and prevent multiparty elections from being held in October.

  [Text] Bulawayo June 5 SAPA -- Zimbabwe Vice-President 
Joshua Nkomo on Sunday [5 June] warned what he described as 
"undesirable elements" in the white community to leave Zimbabwe 
"now before it is too late", the news agency ZIANA reports. 
  He was reacting to reports that a group of whites in 
Bulawayo 
was apparently planning to march into the city in ox-drawn 
wagons in August to mark the defeat of the Ndebele kingdom by 
white colonial settlers 100 years ago. "Whites have continued 
shunning us and they undermine our ability to deal with some 
undesirable elements among them. I warn them (the undesirable 
elements) to move out of our country now before it is too late," 
he said. 
  He warned that Zimbabwe could be plunged into civil war if 
some divisive elements among its people were allowed to 
perpetuate racial friction. 
  Deputy Industry and Commerce Minister Simon Moyo said that 
while most Bulawayo residents were commemorating 100 years of 
the city's existence, some white "vigilantes" in the marula 
commercial farming area, a few kilometres south of Bulawayo, 
were preparing to commemorate the occupation of Lobengula's 
Kingdom, now modern-day Matabeleland. Mr Moyo said the group 
planned to march in a column of "horse-riding rangers and 
ox-drawn wagons" like their fore- fathers did when they took 
over the Ndebele kingdom a century ago. 
  "I wish to warn them (the white settlers) in no uncertain 
terms that such anticipated celebrations will be viewed as a 
declaration of war on the peace-loving people of Zimbabwe," he 
said. 
  "Should they proceed with such rehearsals and attempt to 
carry out the so-called occupation celebrations using what is 
commonly known as the Mangwe Pass Route in my constituency, they 
will profusely regret their racist appetite and misguided 
action," warned Mr Moyo. 
  He did not reveal the identity of the men, but sources said 
they were among a group of white marula farmers who were caught 
with an arms cache in the 1980s. Some were prosecuted and 
served jail terms. 
  Bulawayo Mayor Joshua Malinga said his city had enjoyed the 
best race relations in the country... "We won't allow anybody to 
spoil that atmosphere. We have the capacity and means to make 
sure that this won't happen," he said.

<F P=106> [By David Cohen and Tim Cohen] </F>
  [Text] Government will start transferring powers to 
provinces as soon as this week but has warned that regional 
authorities will first have to prove an ability to manage their 
own affairs. Public Service and Administration Minister Zola 
Skweyiya said yesterday he had begun urgent consultations with 
all nine provincial premiers to clarify the process of 
transferring powers to regional public services. 
  But -- to avoid "authority vacuums" -- provinces would have 
to prove they were capable of managing their public services 
before central government would allocate them specific powers. 
The undertaking follows anxiety on the part of some provincial 
governments about their lack of power and a proclamation in the 
Government Gazette which temporarily transfers all provincial 
and homeland government powers to Pretoria. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party's central committee expressed 
"deep 
disquiet" at the weekend over reports that central government 
would assume provinces' powers. It resolved to take whatever 
steps necessary to ensure that the powers claimed by 
KwaZulu/Natal's premier were devolved as expeditiously as 
possible. 
  Skweyiya denied that government was holding on to powers 
which would allow provinces to run their own public services. 
"Provinces will first have to show they are ready to take 
control. We do not want chaos," he said, adding: "I understand 
the impatience of premiers." 
  He was keen to hand over the powers as soon as possible. In 
the interim period, however, government was responsible for SA's 
900,000 to 1.2-million public servants. 
  Skweyiya said he had begun meeting individual provincial 
premiers, making it "very, very clear" what criteria had to met 
before powers were handed over. Each premier received a 
proposal to study. They had to go back to their provinces and 
study the documentation -- which included details on future 
personnel, assets and budgets -- before they would meet the 
Minister again, as well as the Public Service Commission. 
  The proposed packages for each of the nine provinces varied 
according to their needs, Skweyiya said. He confirmed that not 
all the provinces had yet followed the example of KwaZulu/Natal, 
which had requested in writing that central government allocate 
it all the powers it was entitled to under the interim 
constitution. 
  Skweyiya said he had already met the premiers of the 
[Orange] 
Free State and the Northern Transvaal. Today he is scheduled to 
meet those of the Western Cape, Northern Cape and PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], and in the next two days the 
leaders of KwaZulu/Natal, the North-west and the Eastern Cape. 
  The Minister said he had been impressed with the level of 
preparedness of the Free State, largely because, like 
KwaZulu/Natal, the province's borders had "remained intact". He 
indicated that, where borders had been redrawn and former 
homelands reincorporated into new provinces, he expected it 
would take longer before the provinces were ready to manage 
their own public services. 
  However, he said the difficult process of restructuring the 
public service was gaining momentum. "I am happy with the pace 
of restructuring." 
  The Minister denied that government would in any way renege 
on undertakings in the interim constitution guaranteeing public 
servants their jobs. "There is absolutely no intention to drive 
anyone out of their jobs and onto the streets". 
  Although changes would be necessary to make the public 
service more representative of the new SA -- "a number of 
blacks" would be appointed at managerial level, and the gender 
imbalance would be tackled -- no one (and Skweyiya singled out 
white public servants) had to fear losing their jobs. He said 
his job was to create a single public service, at a national and 
provincial level, which ensured uniformity and parity, including 
pay.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] has come out in limited support of the government's 
Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP]. The committee 
emphasized at a meeting in Ulundi that the provinces should be 
empowered to decide on the implementation of the program. A 
resolution was accepted on budgetary provisions to enable 
provinces to implement reconstruction policies. The committee 
expressed concern over what it said were reports about the 
intention of the central government to assume control of 
existing laws, which under the 1993 constitution fell within the 
competence of the provinces.

  [Text] A member of the Provincial Electoral Commission in 
the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], Mr. Thozamile 
Botha, says unresolved problems may prevent the holding of local 
government elections in the country, even by May next year. 
Speaking in Pretoria at a Department of Constitutional 
Development and Provincial Affairs briefing, Mr. Botha said the 
elections would definitely not take place in October and that 
even the later date was questionable. He said voter 
registration and ward delimitation were among the tasks that 
have still to be completed before local elections could take 
place. The negotiating council had earlier proposed that the 
elections be held in October.

<F P=106> [Report by Piet Muller] </F>
  [Text] Ninety senior executive posts in the central civil 
service system, among others those of receiver of revenue for 
Pretoria, will most likely soon be filled by officials from the 
former homelands and self-governing regions. This will be the 
practical result of a recent directive from the new minister 
responsible for the civil service, Dr. Zola Skweyiya. 
  Several ministers and premiers are understandably also 
walking around "with lists of their own pals who they want to 
appoint to executive positions in the civil service," RAPPORT 
was told. 
  According to Dr. Skweyiya's instructions, these 90 posts may 
not be filled before officials of the civil service in the 
former black territories have obtained positions. This has 
caused a stir in civil service circles as it is seen as a 
deviation from the constitutional ruling that the most qualified 
person should be appointed in a specific post. 
  RAPPORT asked the minister by fax to either confirm or deny 
the information, and to give an explanation of his standpoint 
and the practical effect it will have on new appointments. 
<H5>  Frozen </H5>
  The 90 vacancies, from deputy director upward, have been 
frozen by the Transitional Executive Council. There will not, 
however, be a lengthy waiting period regarding the appointment 
of personnel, since the relevant departments cannot be without 
executive staff for an indefinite period. 
  One of the senior posts likely to be filled by an official 
from a former independent territory is that of receiver of 
revenue in Pretoria. The post is regarded as one of the most 
senior in the civil service. The appointee "must not only have 
a thorough knowledge of tax law, but should also be well versed 
with the practical implementation of that law, otherwise the 
government will be shooting itself in the foot," RAPPORT was 
told. 
  The dismissal of the director general for housing, Mr. Louis 
Kock, by Joe Slovo, has sent shockwaves through the civil 
service even though it took effect with Mr. Kock's consent. 
They are now waiting to see how many other ministers are going 
to try the same. 
<H5>  Vacant </H5>
  The post of director general for manpower is currently 
vacant 
after Mr. Joel Fourie resigned at the end of last month. 
Manpower Minister Tito Mboweni reacted sharply when RAPPORT 
approached him in the wake of rumors that he was trying to 
appoint Professor Halton Cheadle, who has strong ties with 
COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], but found out 
that civil service regulations made the move difficult. An 
allegation has also been made to RAPPORT that Prof. Cheadle was 
then appointed as a consultant at 1,000 rands per day. 
  The minister, in a faxed message, rejected those rumors and 
said that they were inaccurate and based on hearsay. "The 
process to appoint a new director general has not started. The 
process will necessitate consultation between the minister of 
manpower and the civil service commission. You will be informed 
at the opportune moment when the process has been completed and 
the appointment made." 
  According to the same fax, Prof. Cheadle "was not a member 
of 
the department or the ministry. He is one of the possible 
candidates being considered to comprise a team of advisers for 
the ministry. No decision has yet been taken on any member of 
the team." 
<H5>  The Chosen Ones </H5>
  Mr. Casper van Rensburg, executive manager of the 
Association 
of Civil Servants, said he was aware of the rumors that 
ministers were walking around with lists of the chosen people 
they intended to appoint. His organization has already resorted 
to "certain measures" regarding the rumors. 
  He adds that "a director general is not without rights, and 
that it will not be so easy to get rid of senior staff members." 
  "People must be careful not to undermine the expertise of 
the 
executive staff in the civil service," Mr. van Rensburg said. 
"If they are surrounded by inexperienced people, it is usually 
the minister who falls on his face."

  [Text] Cape Town -- Work on a huge reshuffle of the civil 
service by strategic management teams is set to begin within 
weeks. The mammoth task involves welding departments of 
now-defunct tricameral administrations, homelands, 
self-governing territories and provincial administrations into 
new central and provincial departments. 
  Each department will be handled by a three-member team, 
which 
will be empowered to redeploy staff. 
  One tough challenge will be to rationalise into single 
entities those departments where functions were duplicated in 
the apartheid era -- and then choose a head. 
  ANC MP Salie Manie, long involved in think-tanks on 
restructuring the civil service, disclosed details of the plan. 
The teams will work along guidelines meant to ensure 
democratisation and deracialisation of the civil service, while 
ending inefficiency and an "autocratic" approach. 
  Among the reforms proposed by the ANC think-tank is the 
introduction of a performance appraisal system "to avoid the 
civil service being a retirement village". 
  A key goal of the plan will be the implementation of an 
affirmative action policy. 
  Implementation of the plan will have to begin in the wake of 
tension among civil servants elsewhere in the country, 
especially in former homelands. While restructuring will be 
far-reaching, a key goal in the process will be to ensure 
continuity. 
  Decisions on redeployment of staff, and even whether early 
retirement should be allowed in some cases, would depend on 
implications for service delivery and budgetary impact. 
  Manie said pre-election promises that civil servants would 
not lose jobs or be prejudiced by change would be honoured. 
  There are more than a million public servants.

<F P=106> [Report by Eugene Gunning] </F>
  [Text] The ANC is to sell some of its properties abroad to 
replenish its coffers. The money will be used to pay off its 
debt, because at this stage the debt is "quite large," the 
party's senior officials disclosed. 
  Among the most sought after properties which could come 
under 
the hammer are a six-bedroom house in Washington worth about 50 
million U.S. dollars; as well as a farm in Zambia with an 
estimated value of 1 million dollars. At the current exchange 
rate the farm is worth about 3.6 million rands. 
  The ANC said the total value of its properties abroad is 
estimated at about 20 million rands. 
  The proceeds from the sale of the ANC's properties will 
apparently not be enough to pay off all the organization's 
debts. The election has cost the ANC a lot of money. Before the 
start of the campaign there had been the cost to establish an 
infrastructure in South Africa while the organization was in 
exile for several decades. 
<H5>  Debt Burden Relief </H5>
  No doubt the money to come in from the property transactions 
will contribute toward making the ANC's debt burden lighter. 
  To further supplement the organization's coffers, it was 
announced this week that MPs elected under the ANC's banner will 
have to make a contribution toward the coffers. This includes 
President Mandela, ministers, deputy ministers, and senators. 
Amounts of between 750 rands for an ordinary member and 2,000 
rands per month for a minister have been mentioned. 
  ANC Treasurer General Thomas Nkobi, Administrative Secretary 
Henry Makgothi, and Deputy Administrative Secretary Mohamed 
Moosajee spoke to RAPPORT about the organization's financial 
matters. 
  They said it is not true that the ANC had bags full of money 
as so many people seem to believe. It is no longer a liberation 
movement and can therefore no longer depend on funds from abroad. 
  From now on the ANC is to be run along business lines, and 
it 
is to become financially self-sufficient. 
<H5>  Offices Rented </H5>
  Another possibility being considered is to rent out ANC 
office space at the ANC headquarters, 51 Plein Street in 
Johannesburg. 
  The ANC's impressive property portfolio abroad has in the 
past attracted attention. 
  Before the legitimization of the ANC the property had not 
only been an investment but a necessity as well. The 
organization was being run from abroad and for that it needed 
space. 
  This need has now largely fallen away, and property which is 
not going to be sold will most likely be rented out. 
  The first step toward getting rid of the properties began 
this week. On Tuesday ANC offices were already being closed 
down. Due to administrative reasons, it will take a while 
before all the offices are closed as various administrative 
procedures still have to be concluded. 
  The ANC's office in Washington was one of the first to close 
its doors. 
  Among the properties in question are two houses in the U.S. 
with a total value of 83,000 dollars, five premises in London 
with offices and houses with an estimated value of 2.7 million 
rands; a house in Australia valued at 805,000 rands; and houses 
in Germany, Sweden, and Belgium. 
  Also in the neighboring states the ANC has built up a strong 
property portfolio. 
  Especially in Zambia, where its headquarters was situated 
before the organization was unbanned, it has property, among 
others the farm, a block of flats with 30 apartments, and two 
offices measuring 1,500 and 800 square meters, respectively. 
  In Zimbabwe the ANC has offices and 39 houses with an 
estimated value of 4.5 million rands. 
  Mr. Nkobi said a new company is to be created to see to the 
properties.

  [Text] Pretoria June 5 SAPA -- Political indemnity was 
granted to several former security force members in accordance 
with legal procedures in April, Deputy President FW de Klerk 
said on Sunday [5 June]. 
  Mr de Klerk was reacting to a SUNDAY TRIBUNE article 
claiming 
that he had granted indemnity to former Civil Co-operation 
Bureau [CCB] member Maj-Gen Eddie Webb and three men implicated 
in an ambush in which seven people were killed near KwaMashu in 
1990. 
  In a statement, Mr de Klerk said: "There was no political 
advantage to be gained for me or my party from any of these 
decisions". 
  The decision was made in terms of an agreement reached with 
major political parties that Mr de Klerk should continue 
governing South Africa until a formal transfer of power. "A 
large majority of the applicants were African National Congress 
and Inkatha Freedom Party members. They also included an 
application from Maj-Gen Webb. As with other applications I was 
bound to grant indemnity to those who could comply with the 
criteria set out in the (Further Indemnity) Act. This I did 
without favour or prejudice," Mr de Klerk said. 
  It was not necessary to consult the Transitional Executive 
Council on this matter as it did not affect the outcome of the 
electoral process. 
  The SUNDAY TRIBUNE quoted "reliable sources in the new 
government" saying the new administration was furious, but 
Justice Minister Dullah Omar did not want to comment. 
  Lawyers for Human Rights Director Brian Currin said the 
recent indemnities could be illegal.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elias Maluleke] </F>
  [Text] CITY PRESS can today reveal how a rightwing plot 
using German neo-Nazi mercenaries to assassinate President 
Nelson Mandela at his inauguration ceremony at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria was thwarted. A shoot-out between three 
heavily armed German nationals and police near Pretoria in March 
led to the dismantling of the plot to bring thousands of 
neo-Nazi mercenaries into South Africa to kill Mandela and turn 
the country into a bloodbath. 
  An estimated 2,500 of these mercenaries, who are paid 1,000 
German marks (about 2,200) a week, are still in South Africa. 
  The assassination was to have been carried out with mortar 
bombs fired from a hilltop near the Union Buildings and from the 
south side of the building from a hill near the University of 
South Africa while Mandela addressed the nation. Local 
rightwingers and the German neo-Nazis also planned to set off a 
powerful 500kg car-bomb in the Pretoria city centre and another 
at Jan Smuts Airport on that day. 
  CITY PRESS was this week able to piece together the aborted 
plot -- which has been kept under wraps by the authorities. 
Police spokesman Captain Dave Harrington, however, confirmed 
that police knew of the planned assassination but said it could 
not be substantiated at the time. Harrington said police also 
had information that rightwingers "with bombs" had been spotted 
hiding in bushes on the hilltop near the Union Buildings on the 
day of the President's inauguration -- but a police search 
failed to find them. 
  The plot might very well have succeeded but for two things: 
  -- The revelation of heavily-armed German nationals in South 
Africa after a shootout between two young police constables east 
of Pretoria and three men in a car led to the wounding of both 
constables, Juan van Schalkwyk and Danie Pretorius, and the 
death of one of the mercenaries. 
  -- Women aligned to rightwingers involved in the plot 
informed a SADF [South African Defense Force] Commando Unit, 
which passed the information on to Military Intelligence and the 
police. 
  The informants are also believed to have supplied the names 
of rightwingers who were allegedly involved in the bomb blasts 
that rocked the Reef shortly before the elections. It was this 
information that led to the joint police and military forces 
swoop on the bomb suspects, CITY PRESS was informed. 
  The three Germans involved in the shootout last March had 
been keeping a low profile in Tierpoort when the two young 
constables followed them. The three were travelling in a white 
Opel Record car -- later found to be registered in a dead man's 
name. They led the constables into a trap and opened fire on 
them with AK-47s. The policemen's lives were saved by 
bullet-proof vests but both were wounded, one seriously. 
  The body of the one of the Germans, Thomas Franz Kunst (32), 
was later found in the bush with nightsight binoculars, an AK-47 
with a silencer and 200 AK-47 rounds strapped to his body. Two 
hours later a second German, Stephan Rays (26), was arrested in 
the bush. Later a third suspect, Horst Klenz (57), was 
arrested. Klenz, also known as Heinrich Siems and Kluger, is 
wanted in Namibia in connection with the murders in 1989 of a 
policeman and a security guard -- who were killed in a bomb 
blast during the assisted escape of rightwingers Leonard 
Veenendal and Darryl Stopforth from a Namibian prison. 
  CITY PRESS learned that after the information was received 
from "women", police and military forces blockaded part of 
Donkerhoek in Pretoria East last month, arrested several members 
of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and other rightwing 
groups in connection with the bomb blasts and recovered an arms 
cache. 
  The police also raided a "safe house" used by German 
neo-Nazis where they found a large quantity of arms and 
explosives and documents relating to terror attacks. 
  Some of the would-be assassins are believed to have used the 
Donkerhoek premises of Radio Pretoria for meetings. The radio 
station interviewed two of the neo-Nazis and described them as 
"patriotic" foreigners who were risking their lives for the 
"volk" [Afrikaners].

  [Excerpts] Neo-Nazi mercenaries from Germany -- some of 
them possibly posing as tourists -- are being brought into South 
Africa in large numbers to wage terrorism against the new 
government. Up to 2,500 hired killers could already be in the 
country. 
  A special investigation by CITY PRESS has found a terrifying 
web of conspiracy between the highly trained mercenaries and 
groups of rightwingers bent on toppling the ANC-led Government 
of National Unity. Police said they knew many German neo-Nazis 
were infiltrating the country -- and warned that they should 
expect no mercy from the law. 
  It has been found that the Nazis -- who enjoy close links 
with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] -- and other secret 
organisations -- have been armed with weapons of Russian origin 
and provided with military uniforms used by the SADF [South 
African Defense Force]. The mercenaries have also been linked 
to Third Force activities, the manufacturing of deadly weapons 
and gun running. 
  Security forces believe some of the Nazis enter the country 
illegally and are issued with false identification documents. 
South African and German authorities are, however, cooperating 
in trying to weed out the Nazi assassins. 
  Although the Department of Home Affairs and National 
Statistics Services have no figures of German tourists who 
entered SA [South Africa] in March and April, the figure for 
February was 10,477, compared to less than 1,000 in January. It 
is estimated that more than 800 mercenaries entered the country 
in February. 
  During an interview, which was attended by a foreign 
television crew, one of the sources -- who asked to remain 
anonymous -- showed CITY PRESS a large quantity of rifle bullets 
he said he had purchased from the foreigners. [passage omitted] 
  CITY PRESS also found that when Germans enter the country 
they are put in a private house in Kempton Park. There they are 
given money and documents before they are dispatched to their 
underground cells. 
  The Germans were promised 1,000 German marks per week for 
doing duty in South Africa. 
  A German embassy spokesman in Pretoria said they knew of the 
Nazis coming into SA from Namibia and Mozambique. Others came 
from Germany, the French Foreign Legion and Bosnia. 
  "There is little that we can do to stop them coming into the 
country with valid documents, even though they are not coming 
with good intentions. However, we are working closely with 
South African authorities to identify them," he said. 
  Safety and Security Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said 
police knew of the mercenaries' presence and special action to 
counter them had been launched. "They are planning to use South 
Africa for easy pickings as a mercenary mecca. But we are 
watching them. Their moves are being closely monitored." Kotze 
said an investigation was underway into the role of the Nazis as 
they were regarded as extremely dangerous.

  [Text] The Goldstone Commission has information linking the 
new minister of police in KwaZulu/Natal, Celani Mtetwa, to 
illegal gun- unning for Inkatha. 
  Sources inside and outside the commission confirmed this 
week 
that they have information tying Mtetwa to the receipt of 
weapons from the network alleged to have been set up by renegade 
South African Police members. 
  The police portfolio in the Natal cabinet has been at the 
centre of this week's battle between the ANC and the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] in Natal over regional executive positions. 
  It has also emerged that the government of national unity is 
keeping new details of the involvement of key former South 
African Police [SAP] and IFP officials in political violence 
under close wraps for fear of the political repercussions. 
  The MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN has been leaked the second report 
of the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] task group on hit squads in 
the KwaZulu Police which names IFP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] leader Themba Khoza, IFP PWV parliamentarian 
Humphrey Ndlovu, and 16 senior KwaZulu (KZP) policemen who are 
said to have taken part in hit squad activity. No action has 
been taken on this, although it is dated March 29. And a new 
Goldstone report, which was expected to have been made public, 
has been sent to the international team investigating the 
involvement of IFP and SAP officials in "third force" activity. 
  This report, dealing with covert operations against anti- 
apartheid activists, corruption and other criminal activities by 
policemen, was expected to be released three weeks ago, 
according to sources in the ANC. 
  Sources in the commission have confirmed that such a report 
was drawn up. "There was going to be a report but it was 
decided it was inappropriate for Goldstone to have his own 
report now that the international team was investigating," said 
a source close to the minister of safety and security. 
Goldstone is understood to have discussed the report with the 
minister, Sidney Mufamadi. 
  Judge Richard Goldstone confirmed his commission had handed 
over the relevant information to the international team. "All 
information has been submitted to the international team," he 
said. Asked if his commission would produce further reports on 
the matter, he said: "It depends very much on what comes out of 
the international investigation. There may or may not be, I 
really can't say." 
  The second report by the TEC task group investigating 
hitsquads in the KwaZulu Police recommends the immediate 
suspension of the deputy commissioner of the KZP, Major General 
Sipho Mathe, on grounds that he aided and concealed the 
activities of hit men in the KZP. Among other things, he is 
accused of "disgraceful conduct" by failing to investigate hit 
squad claims against three senior Inkatha members. 
  The report paints a frightening picture of the systematic 
concealment, failure to investigate and conniving at hit squad 
activity in the KZP by senior officers. It recommends the 
suspension of two KZP brigadiers, C.P. Mzimela and B.L. Ndlovu, 
and a district commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sipho Mdluli. It 
also calls for charges of defeating the ends of justice to be 
investigated against L.A. Hlengwa, a former policeman and 
currently an IFP head office official in Ulundi. Also 
recommended is the suspension of two majors, two captains and a 
lieutenant and the investigation of a brigadier, a major and two 
captains. 
  The TEC report says an investigation into a massacre at 
Nqutu, Natal by a KwaZulu policeman, Lieutenant Mbatha, 
"revealed that the rest of the suspects were members of a hit 
squad that operated from hostels in East Rand and that Themba 
Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu were involved in the planning of the 
massacre." 
  The reluctance to take firm action against "third force" 
suspects reflects differences in both the ANC and the government 
about how to deal with criminal rightwing elements in the 
security forces. 
  In the ANC, there are those who are urging a "softly-softly" 
approach, in an attempt to win these elements over. They appear 
to have the backing of State President Nelson Mandela. 
  Others feel the quick removal of those who were involved in 
orchestrating violence is the only way to finally stop those 
involved in political destabilisation and get to the bottom of 
the political violence which has rocked South Africa since 1990. 
  The debate around indemnity is also crucial. The authors of 
the TEC report urge the TEC to grant selective indemnity to 
witnesses who are prepared to give further details of "third 
force" activity. They warn that without being able to offer 
potential witnesses indemnity, there is "little or no prospect 
of rooting out those orchestrating this significant cause of 
political violence." 
  The government has made no substantial moves towards 
addressing this particular indemnity issue. Senior former South 
African Police officers are pushing for a blanket indemnity for 
all political crimes after a cut off date, without disclosure of 
the crime. They apparently hope this will prevent lower ranking 
officers from testifying against their seniors. 
  The ANC and human rights activists have been pushing for the 
full disclosure by those involved in political violence to help 
them with their investigations. At the moment, the government 
is taking the view that they cannot defy the generals without 
destabilising the security forces -- something they are not 
prepared to risk. 
  Meanwhile, all Judge Goldstone's witnesses -- the mystery 
"Qs" who were sent to Denmark for safety in the wake of the 
release of the "third force" report -- were brought back to 
South Africa three weeks ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Norman West] </F>
  [Excerpts] The army has been selling thousands of rifles 
and pistols at bargain-basement prices to defence force members 
for personal use. Despite a national outcry against a 
proliferation of weapons, .303 rifles are being sold for as 
little as R34.10 [rand]. The price is less than the cost of a 
packet of 20 cartridges at dealers or the R50 revenue stamp on a 
police licence to possess a firearm legally. Ammunition for the 
.303s is sold by the army at 28c [cents] a round. 
  Many serving officers and citizen force members, the 
majority 
white, have jumped at the offer, and some have resold the 
weapons as hunting rifles through gunshops, making hundreds of 
rands profit out of the ex-army stock. 
  Lieutenant-Colonel Brian du Toit of the Directorate of 
Communications of the army confirmed that the sale of the .303s 
was continuing. He said that, in terms of army regulations, the 
following people qualified to buy the weapons: 

  -  Serving members of the permanent force, citizen force and 
commandos who have completed five years' continuous service; 
  -  Members of the permanent force who are retiring after 20 
years; 
  -  Veterans of World War 2 if they can provide a service 
certificate. 


    In the past .38 Special revolvers were also sold in the same 
way but were no longer available, Lieutenant-Colonel du Toit 
said. 
  ANC MP and former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing] commander Ronnie Kasrils, who served 
on the defence sub-council of the TEC and works closely with 
Defence Minister Joe Modise, said yesterday he was taking up the 
matter immediately with Mr Modise with a view to having the sale 
of the weapons investigated. [passage omitted] 
  Ministry of Defence spokesman Das Herbst said he believed 
the 
sales were "a continuation of an old policy". [passage omitted]

  [Text] The sale of old .303 rifles at bargain prices to 
defence force members will be probed by Defence Minister Joe 
Modise this week. Ministry spokesman Das Herbst told THE STAR 
yesterday that the matter had been brought to Modise's attention. 
  It would be dealt with by Modise and the Chief of the South 
African National Defence Force, General George Meiring, he said. 
  It was reported yesterday that the rifles -- which date back 
to World War 2 -- were being sold for as little as R34.10 
[rand]. Ammunition for the .303s was being sold for only 28c 
[cents] a round. 
  Those who qualified to buy the cut-rate weapons were members 
of the permanent force, citizen force or commandos who had 
completed five years of continuous service, and members of the 
permanent force who are retiring. World War 2 veterans with a 
service certificate could also buy the weapons at cheap rates. 
  ANC member of Parliament Ronnie Kasrils has slammed the 
sales, pointing to the proliferation of firearms in the country.

  [Text] Cape Town June 3 SAPA -- The SA [South African] 
National Defence Force [SANDF] would be sent into the 
gang-ridden Cape Flats next week, the African National Congress' 
Western Cape spokesman on policing Vincent Diba told protesters 
outside Parliament on Friday [3 June]. Some of the 30 
protesting Manenberg Anti-Crime Forum members chained themselves 
to the gates of Parliament demanding stronger action against 
gangs. 
  The protest is believed to be the first at parliament since 
the ANC came to power after the April poll. One protester 
carried an ANC flag, while others wore ANC buttons. Police who 
monitored the four-hour demonstration at one point confiscated 
posters and a coffin carried by the group, but returned them 
after intervention by Mr Diba. 
  He said he had held talks with Western Cape MEC [member of 
the Executive Commission] for police Patrick McKenzie on Friday 
and Monday but Mr McKenzie did not yet have the delegated powers 
to address the gang problem. "I want to assure you now that you 
say you want the SANDF to go to Manenberg. You will get it. 
You are definitely going to get the Defence Force in that 
area." He said he would speak to Minister of Safety and 
Security Sidney Mufamadi on Friday or at the weekend and report 
back to the group on Monday. 
  The SANDF would be in Manenberg "definitely in the coming 
week". An independent office to receive complaints against the 
police would also be set up. 
  Manenberg Anti-Crime Forum spokesman Irvin Kinnes said the 
protesters included National Party [NP] and ANC supporters. "We 
are sick of gangs," he said. "It has nothing to do with whether 
you are ANC or NP. Parliament has a responsibility to protect 
the lives of our people in Manenberg. We want the Defence 
Force, we want the gangsters' guns out. "If it's the people's 
Parliament they must react to the people's demands." 
  Three protesters chained themselves to the gates of 
Parliament in Plein Street at about 12.20PM as members of the 
police special guard unit looked on. They unchained themselves 
later in the afternoon. Several protesters stood on the kerb of 
Plein Street with a coffin, which Mr Kinnes said was meant to 
symbolise the number of people who had died in gang violence on 
the Cape Flats. Posters called for the removal of "corrupt" 
police forces from Manenberg, and for the SANDF to move in to 
the area. 
  Shortly after 4PM policemen confiscated the posters, then 
picked up the coffin and tried to carry it to a patrol van. 
Protesters moved to stop them, and a tug-of-war developed. The 
senior policeman on the scene, Lt-Col Willem Snyman, told the 
protesters they could reclaim the coffin from Cape Town's 
central police station when their protest was over, and it was 
loaded into the van. Mr Kinnes later asked Mr Diba to negotiate 
its return "because someone has to be buried in it tomorrow". 
  "I have no problem with that," said Col Snyman. "I just want 
to look inside and see if there's anyone in it." He watched as 
two of the protesters opened the coffin's top panel. The 
demonstrators dispersed shortly afterwards -- with their coffin.

  [Text] The police in the Western Cape have objected to an 
undertaking by the ANC's regional police spokesman, Mr. Vincent 
Diba, that the National Defense Force will be deployed in the 
gang-riddled Manenberg area of the Cape Flats next week. 
  A police spokesman, Colonel Raymond (Dawoud), said 
gang-related crime was a police responsibility and not that of 
the National Defense Force, which was not trained to handle the 
situation. Speaking on behalf of the Western Cape MEC [Members 
of Executive Committee] for police, Mr. Patrick Mckenzie, Col. 
(Dawoud) appealed to people not to allow the issue to develop 
political overtones. He added that crime in the area had 
decreased significantly since the start of Operation Gang-Bust 
last week.

<F P=106> [Article by Charmaine Pretorius] </F>
  [Excerpt] The absorption into the South African National 
Defence Force [SANDF] of 30,000 Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation -- ANC military wing; MK] and APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army] cadres and members of the homeland defence 
forces, will mean that 30,000 Defence Force members will have to 
go over three years through rationalisation, which could include 
retrenchment. 
  This was made clear yesterday by chief of the Defence Force, 
General Georg Meiring. 
  Addressing a group of journalists at the SANDF Headquarters, 
Gen Meiring said because the SANDF "did not have the money to 
maintain such a large permanent force" it would, through 
rationalisation, have to maintain the same size of the force as 
it was at present, which, in effect, meant a reduction of 30,000 
people. 
  He said because the non-statutory forces' recruits to be 
incorporated into the SANDF still needed a lot of training, it 
was not foreseen that people would be "put on the street within 
a few months or even a year's time." 
  The bridging courses of the new recruits to prepare them for 
reincorporation into the SANDF would be overseen by a British 
military assistance team, which will arrive in the country 
within the next few days. 
  This whole process would take about three years, Gen Meiring 
said, and would, among others, include the selection of recruits 
who would after initial training qualify to join the SANDF as 
permanent force members. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Themba Khumalo] </F>
  [Text] Scores of MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing] soldiers at the Wallmansthal assembly 
point near Pretoria are reported to have left camp last Friday 
as tension grew between the ANC military wing and the newly 
formed South African National Defence Force [SANDF]. The former 
guerillas went to MK headquarters in Johannesburg and told their 
seniors that they would not go back until their grievances were 
addressed. 
  There are also claims that tension is simmering between MK 
and the predominately white senior officers of the SANDF over 
the non-appointment of black generals into the army as part of 
the integration process. A colonel in the SANDF told 
journalists in Pretoria that although it was expected that MK 
commander Siphiwe Nyanda would be made a general, "he is simply 
not qualified to be one". 
  MK is believed to have submitted about 17 names of its 
veteran soldiers who, in their view, qualified for the most 
senior army ranks. The names are said to have been rejected by 
the largely white SANDF officers who asked MK to reduce the list 
to seven. 
  According to MK sources trouble started when they complained 
about the predominantly white command structures which they said 
violated the evaluation rules that were agreed upon at the Joint 
Monitoring Coordinating Committee, set up to evaluate those 
suitable to serve in the new force. 
  The last straw was when the MK cadres mysteriously 
contracted 
diarrhoea after eating food which was prepared by the catering 
army staff at the camp. 
  The allegations were denied by the army spokesman Major Nick 
Sendall, who referred to a press conference held on Thursday by 
the Chief of SANDF, General Georg Meiring, in which he said the 
current ranks held by white officers would be treated as 
temporary until the integration process had been completed. 
Sendall said only Parliament had the prerogative to appoint 
generals.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Bumpy Road -- Given the "huge obstacles" that lie ahead, 
Labor Minister Tito Mboweni "seems to have identified what needs 
to be done in the next five years," notes an editorial in 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 6 June on page 14. He 
argues "broadly, for a tripartite `social partnership' between 
government, business and labor -- but one which gives due 
recognition to the increasingly competitive world economy which 
South Africa is re-entering" -- "an attempt to create an 
adequately harmonious system in circumstances which naturally 
militate against it." But "it may suceed simply because there is 
no real alternative." "The fragile economy needs a period of 
consolidation and painful restructuring. Available state 
resources must be directed at the poorest sections of the 
population. Tariff barriers must be gradually but surely 
lowered. The trade-off between job security and wages will 
become more onerous. For many, the emphasis will be on sacrifice 
and and deferring the fulfilment of post-apartheid expectations. 
This will test Mboweni's partnership to the limit." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Amnesty -- "It is imperative the Government sets firm 
principles and guidelines on the issue of amnesty;" Vice 
President de Klerk granting indemnity and commuting sentences of 
rightwingers "are bound to add fuel to the fire," notes an 
editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 6 June on page 
6. "Pressure on the new Government regarding amnesty is being 
applied on several fronts": the previous government "seems to 
have obtained a commitment from the ANC of blanket amnesty for 
State-inspired crimes up to a certain date" and attempts to draw 
"the far rightwing" into negotiations may compel the government 
to extend indemnity to those responsible for the Johannesburg 
car bombs. "Even more controversial will be amnesty to Chris 
Hani's killers." "The Government will have to move swiftly on 
its amnesty plans, including the setting up of a `truth 
commission', and defuse a potentially explosive situation." 
  Frontline Summit -- "It was appropriate that President 
Nelson 
Mandela's first foreign engagement was to attend a summit of 
Frontline States in Harare last week. It was these states that 
provided refuge and succour when the apartheid regime forced our 
liberation organisations and thousands of political refugees 
into exile," the second editorial in the 6 June SOWETAN states. 
"Undoubtedly," the new South Africa owes the Frontline States an 
enormous debt." However the suggestion that the "Frontline club 
be retained" "needs to be carefully considered" as "a formilised 
structure could be a costly duplication of other structures like 
the Southern African Development Community." "The glue in the 
bonding process among Southern African countries is economic 
progress" and "it makes more sense to devote resources to what 
Namibian President Sam Nujoma says is the new struggle against 
poverty, disease and ignorance." 
<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Affirmative Action -- "The relaxed mood of the country as a 
result of the conciliatory speeches and statements of President 
Mandela may not last much longer. Steps are being taken in 
various aspects of life to bring into force the government's 
policies of empowerment, affirmative action and so on," notes an 
editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 3 June on 
page 6. "There is a plan to place the Defense Ministry under 
civilain control" and "there is also talk of a complete 
reorganisation of the South African Police Service." Eskom 
[Electricity Supply Commission] and Transnet [public 
transportation company] are "already applying affirmative 
action, which means that Whites are not being taken on but 
Blacks are. Some government departments are following a similiar 
line." "Redressing the balance of unemployment by putting Whites 
out of jobs, or denying them employment, will create the very 
conditions that will breed White resistance or force Whites to 
emigrate." "The government should not do anything to upset 
people, Whites in particular, by making drastic changes that 
undermine confidence in the spirit of reconciliation or by 
encouraging discrimination in reverse."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good afternoon. The government and National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators this 
morning concluded talks on the Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of 
the Black Cockerel] issue, which had lasted about 15 days. It 
is presumed that Vorgan may soon become a commercial station, 
even though its modes of operation have not been made public. 
Fortunately this obstacle has been overcome. As a result, the 
government and UNITA will this afternoon return to the 
Mulungushi Conference Center to discuss the issue of swearing in 
UNITA deputies. 
  This morning's meeting was attended by the mediators and the 
troika of observers. Considerable progress may be achieved if 
the two sides continue showing the willingness to negotiate, 
placing national interests above all else. The government team 
has already been showing this willingness, and for this it has 
been praised by political analysts in Lusaka and elsewhere. 
  Meanwhile, regarding the new proposals presented over the 
past few days by the government, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim 
told the TIMES OF ZAMBIA newspaper in today's edition that his 
organization is studying the document, adding that they agree 
with a number of issues, while other points need a careful 
assessment. 
  This morning's meeting was unexpected, since in the past few 
hours UNITA had requested more time to reflect on the Vorgan 
issue, which was at last approved, following agreement by the 
two negotiating teams. Meanwhile, Dr. Fernando Faustino Muteka, 
head of the government delegation team, this morning visited the 
diplomatic mission of the Republic of Angola, having held brief 
talks with embassy personnel. Luis Perdilhao, first secretary 
of the Angolan Embassy in Lusaka, briefed him on some projects 
that are currently underway, difficulties faced by the embassy, 
and future prospects.

<F P=106> [Article by Chris Louw] </F>
  [Text] The debilitating power impasse of the nine new 
provincial governments will continue until at least the end of 
the month, when central government adopts a budget for the 
financial year. 
  The nine provincial premiers, frustrated at the inability to 
get their new governments up and running, can do little more 
than prepare legislation pre-empting the transfer of powers and 
functions they assume will be transferred to their provinces by 
central government. 
  The provinces were also warned this week by the chairman of 
the Commission on Provincial Government, Thozamile Botha, to 
speedily begin finalising their budgets for the 1995/96 
financial year. "It is already too late for them to submit 
budgets for the current financial year," Botha told the MAIL 
&amp; 
GUARDIAN. "Even next year's budget has largely been prepared by 
the previous government." 
  Botha said it normally took 18 months to prepare a budget. 
However, he expected major revisions to the 1995/96 budget drawn 
up by the De Klerk administration. Most of the changes will be 
in order to accommodate the ANC's reconstruction and development 
plan. The nine provincial premiers had a meeting in Cape Town 
last week during which serious complaints were raised about 
their inability to start governing. 
  Botha this week could offer the power-starved leaders -- 
seven from the ANC, one from Inkatha and one from the National 
Party -- no immediate solace. He said it would take at least 
five years, and probably longer, for the provincial governments 
to be fully established in terms of the new constitution. 
  The premiers will have to accept that they will be almost 
completely powerless until the national budget is passed by 
parliament on June 22. 
  Botha advised them to start establishing Provincial Revenue 
Funds and to pass an Appropriation Act allowing central 
government to allocate funds to them. 
  Describing the situation as a "Catch 22", he said no funds 
could be transferred to the provinces unless they had their 
Revenue Funds in place. "As soon as possible, they should 
establish full treasury departments. People with the necessary 
expertise from the former bantustans and from the previous 
provinces are available to assist with this task." 
  The matter is further complicated by the fact that none of 
the nine provinces knows exactly what powers and functions it is 
entitled to. They are expected to plan their budgets on the 
basis of how they assume "on paper" their new governments will 
function. 
  Botha advised the provinces to invent "prototypes" of what 
they assume their new ministries and staff components will be 
like, and to plan their budgets accordingly. 
  The final powers and functions of the various provinces will 
be decided by Botha's commission -- but only after the provinces 
have applied to "reclaim" functions from central government. 
"This will not happen on day one," Botha warned. "It is a 
process that will have to be approached step by step." 
  It was important, he said, that the necessary structures be 
securely in place before functions were trnasferred from 
existing provincial and homeland administrations to the new 
provinces. "The integration will have to run concurrently with 
the phasing out of the old administrations." 
  Provincial governments will only be possible once a 
proclamation has been passed allowing President Nelson Mandela 
to appoint an administrator responsible for functions belonging 
to the provinces in terms of the constitution, but which some of 
the economically weaker ones may be unable to assume. 
  Botha said he was aware of the frustrations of the premiers. 
But he cautioned them to rather "start doing some of the basic 
things now to ensure that their governments will run smoothly." 
  These included "less controversial" steps like the 
establishment of management structures and ministerial task 
forces to liaise with the administrator about the allocation of 
functions. 
  They should also start establishing provincial public 
service 
commissions to assist them to take over the task of provincial 
employers. Provincial standing committees should be put in 
place as part of the mechanism of passing bills into law. 
  Botha said the premiers had to balance their political 
ambitions with the administrative capabilities of their 
provinces. "Money will follow the functions as soon as they are 
reclaimed from central government." 
  Provinces would also have to accept that they would not be 
able to plan outside the provincial budgets for this year.

  [Text] The government of national unity is facing its first 
major test in trying to get the intricate system of national, 
provincial, and local government, agreed to by multiparty 
negotiators, off the ground. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said at a 
news conference in Pretoria that no powers had yet been assigned 
to provinces. This had been underlined by President Nelson 
Mandela's issuing a Government Gazette that temporarily assigned 
all government functions to central government ministries. 
  Another obstacle was that elections for local governments 
would take place only in a year's time. 
  Mr. Meyer said that the process of assigning powers to the 
provinces would take place within a matter of days and that he 
would meet provincial executive committee members on Monday. He 
would meet provincial premiers on Thursday. However, he said 
the question of financial transfers to provincial government 
still had to be ironed out.

  [Text] The police say a thorough investigation has produced 
no evidence of an alleged plot between German neo-Nazis and 
South Africa ultra right-wingers to assassinate President Nelson 
Mandela during his inauguration in Pretoria last month. 
According to a newspaper report the extremists had planned a 
mortar attack on the Union Buildings from a nearby hill. The 
police said they had followed all leads, including German 
neo-Nazi activity in South Africa. German right-wingers have 
been arrested after a gun battle with police near Pretoria, but 
there has been no evidence of assassination plans.

  [Excerpts] Tunisia is preparing to host the 30th African 
summit, which opens on 13 June. In preparation for this summit, 
the 60th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OAU 
member-states opened in the capital today. 
  In the opening session, Benjamin Bounkoulou, chairman of the 
former council and Congolese foreign minister invited the 
delegation of the Republic of South Africa to take the seats 
reserved for it, noting in so doing the country's officially 
joining the OAU. 
  Prime Minister Hamed Karoui delivered the official speech at 
the opening session. [passage omitted] The prime minister 
talked about the dire need for African states to notice jointly 
the changes witnessed by the world today, as well as the 
development of blocs and groupings, so as to move from a period 
of following events to one of having an impact on them and of 
holding the reigns of initiative in order to safeguard our 
interests and continue our contribution to the development of 
human civilization. 
  The prime minister said that the OAU remains the best 
framework for uniting our ranks, shouldering our efforts, 
defending our rights and interests, and imposing the status we 
deserve on the international arena, particularly as the present 
OAU foreign ministers' session is taking place at a critical 
stage in the history of our continent and that of our 
contemporary world. 
  The prime minister pointed out that the priority of 
priorities on which the Africans' efforts must be applied is the 
achievement of peace, development, and cooperation. 
Responsibility compels us to deal with our internal situation 
with all decisiveness by adopting political and social reforms. 
Every state must find the suitable method for its situation so 
as to deepen its reforms by avoiding the dangers lying in wait 
for democracy, such as religious extremism and tribal conflict.

  [Text] Tunis, 6 June (PANA) -- The Rwandese Patriotic Front 
(RPF) supports the United Nations decision to send a 
peace-keeping force into Rwanda, but objects to number of troops 
proposed, the front's representative told PANA in Tunis Monday 
[6 June]. 
  Bizimungu Pasteur, who is representing the RPF at the 
five-day OAU ministerial council of ministers, which has just 
opened in the Tunisian capital, said in an interview that "a 
force of 5,500 is exaggerated. About 2,000 is acceptable to the 
RPF." Bizimungu is an executive committee member of the RPF and 
was designated to be interior minister in the broad-based 
government of Rwanda, under the 4 August agreement with the 
Rwandese Government. He said the UN and the OAU should be 
completely clear in their definition of the mandate of the 
peace-keeping force. Fourteen African countries announced in 
Harare over the weekend that they were prepared to send troops 
into Rwanda to end the bloodletting there. 
  Rwanda's warring parties ended ceasefire talks last week 
with 
no new progress toward a truce and with the RPF vowing to fight 
on. Aid workers said many of the more than a million people 
uprooted by the massacres could die unless supplies of food and 
medicine reach them soon. The OAU is supporting international 
efforts to bring to justice the individual leaders responsible 
for the killings in Rwanda, where an estimated 500,000 people 
have been killed in one of Africa's most horrible tribal wars. 
  The war was sparked by the killing, on 6 April, of Rwanda's 
president, Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, in a mysterious plane 
crash near Kigali. His death sparked revenge killings against 
the minority Tutsi, who also constitute the majority among RPF 
combatants.

  [Text] Tunis, 6 June (PANA) -- OAU Secretary General Salim 
Ahmed Salim said Monday [6 June] in Tunis that the most crucial 
issue facing the organisation was how to stop the carnage in 
Rwanda and not which faction represented the country at the 
ministerial session. "We are meeting at a time to celebrate the 
victory of South Africa but also to stop the agony of the 
conflict in Rwanda and Africa as a whole," he told the 
correspondent of the PAN AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA) in Tunis. 
The situation in Rwanda, he said, would remain one of concern 
as long the parties to the conflict failed to agree on a 
ceasefire. "We are actively involved in getting Africans to 
contribute troops for peacekeeping and are quite satisfied with 
the response," [word indistinct] Salim. Apart from Ghana, 
Ethiopia and Senegal, he said, Congo and Nigeria had given firm 
commitments to contribute forces. He said some African 
countries which were unable to contribute troops had offered 
other help in resolving the crisis. Namibia, Salim said, had 
pledged 500,000 US dollars to assist UNAMIR [UN Assistant 
Mission in Rwanda] in the peacekeeping mission. "The African 
commitment and African readiness to do something is there," he 
said. The current ministerial session, he said, would focus on 
how to strengthen the organisation's capacity to manage and 
prevent conflicts but would also create conditions for what he 
called the "second liberation of the continent." 
  Speaking earlier at a press conference Salim said the 
peaceful elections in South Africa was a miracle, commending the 
spirit of reconciliation in which the elections were held and an 
all-race government installed. "South Africa has demonstrated 
something more: It has shown that notwithstanding the 
complexity of a situation, given national dialogue, leadership 
and foresight, it is possible to resolve the most intractable 
problem including that of Rwanda," he said. 
  Rwanda is represented at the current session by the foreign 
minister of the interim government, Jerome Bicamumpaka. The 
Rwanda Patriotic Front is represented by Bizimungu Pasteur, 
member of the front's executive committee and minister designate 
for internal affairs of the broadbased government put in place 
after the Arusha August 1993 accord. Rwanda's warring parties 
ended ceasefire talks last week without making progress towards 
a truce and with the front vowing to fight on. The OAU is 
supporting international efforts to bring to account the 
individual leaders responsible for the killings in the country. 
The carnage has claimed 500,000 lives in eight weeks.

  [Text] Tunis, 6 Jun (MENA)--Egypt has called for convening 
an extraordinary session of the OAU foreign ministers council to 
discuss the deteriorating economic and social situation in 
Africa. This came in a statement Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa made 
at the OAU ministerial council while commenting on a report on 
the general situation in Africa submitted by OAU Secretary 
General Salim Ahmed Salim. 
  Musa said that important events have occurred in Africa this 
year, noting that he agrees with Salim's report on its negative 
and positive aspects. He mentioned the recent positive 
developments in Africa, notably the declaration of a new 
government in South Africa and the establishment of a mechanism 
for resolving disputes within the framework of the OAU. He said 
that progress has been achieved in a number of areas that have 
long worried Africa, such as the improvement in the situation in 
Liberia, the positive developments in Mozambique, the stable 
ties between Libya and Chad, and Namibia's recent restoration of 
the Gulf of Whales. 
  Musa pointed out that Africa encountered a number of basic 
problems such as the tragic situation in Rwanda, the problems in 
Somalia, the stagnant situation in Angola, and the stalemate on 
the Lockerbie issue. He emphasized that the most important 
problems facing Africa are the serious deterioration in the 
economic and social situation, which far outweighs the political 
problems. 
  Musa pointed out that not only the economic situation but 
also all aspects of the social situation are deteriorating, such 
as the refugee problem, drought, and the environment. He stated 
that, although Salim's report notes that progress was achieved 
in certain African countries, the economic situation in general 
is bad and is getting worse in most cases. He said that Salim's 
report notes that the GATT agreement and the establishment of 
the International Trade Organization will increase the volume of 
international trade to approximately $200 billion and that 
Africa must obtain a share of this increase. 
  Discussing the issue of African debts, Musa stressed the 
need 
to find a solution to this problem, noting that this is 
insufficient to confront the African problems because debts, 
trade, development, and funding are integrated elements. He 
expressed support for the establishment of an economic group. 
He said that Egypt calls for convening an extraordinary meeting 
of the OAU ministerial council to discuss and assess the overall 
economic and social situation in Africa in light of 
international developments. He said that such a meeting will 
not be confined to discussing the problem of debts but also 
social problems, the environment, and the refugee problem 
whether resulting from internal conflicts or natural causes.

  [Text] Yaounde, 6 Jun (AFP) -- The Yaounde authorities have 
made a second appeal to arbitration in the International Court 
of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague for the Cameroon-Nigeria border to 
be definitively demarcated, Cameroonian Justice Minister Douala 
Moutome announced yesterday. 
  This new appeal, which concerns the whole of the 
Cameroon-Nigeria border, from Lake Chad to the Atlantic, follows 
"the occupation of Cameroonian villages in the northern part" of 
the country, the minister added on national radio in Yaounde. 
  According to Cameroonian military sources, Nigerian troops 
took up positions in two villages in northern Cameroon about two 
weeks ago. 
  Such incidents have been common along the 1,500-km land 
border between the two countries since the 1960's, particularly 
in the Lake Chad Region. 
  In early 1994, Yaounde had already appealed to the ICJ 
regarding its border dispute with Abuja over the Bakassi 
Peninsula, an oil- rich region of 1,000 square kilometers in the 
Gulf of Guinea, over which both countries claim sovereignty.

  [Text] There is no doubt that the Chadian Government and 
its armed opposition never agree: The National Awakening 
Committee for Peace and Democracy in Chad [CSNPD], the southern 
movement led by Moise Kete, has just denied an official report 
that a strategist from its military wing has defected to the 
government in Ndjamena. According to Rene Ngakouto Beyeme, CSNPD 
spokesman in Bangui, the report is nothing but a mind-poisoning 
gimmick on the part of the Chadian Government. Allain Georges 
Ngatoua has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Ngatoua] The CSNPD spokesman, Rene 
Ngakouto Beyeme, explained this morning in Bangui that Moise 
Kete's movement does not have a military strategist named 
(Makna) in its ranks. Mr. Beyeme told reporters that the report 
carried by LE PROGRES, the mouthpiece of Idriss Deby's Social 
Movement for Democracy in Chad, is completely false. 
  [Beyeme] I say, and I repeat, that within the CSNPD we have 
no military strategist or officer named (Makna). The story 
about the 250 fighters referred to Ndjamena is absolutely false. 
Furthermore, we are aware that when Deby visited the south of 
the country, he set up committees charged with recruiting young 
men into the Army, with or without their consent, and this is 
being done at the greatest expense of the parents of these young 
men. One Doub Alifa, sultan of the erstwhile kingdoms of 
Bagereye, is the man in charge of these committees. All I can 
say is that in the political staff [preceding word in English] 
to which I belong, there are politicians, not military 
strategists. [end recording]

  [Text] One could say that relative calm has returned to 
Chad. After meeting with the government yesterday, the 
Federation of Chadian Trade Unions [UST] has decided to suspend 
its general strike. Here is Rene Dila Yombirim with a report. 
  [Begin Yombirim recording] After intense negotiations last 
night, the government and the labor unions were able to sign a 
joint communique stating that the 37-day general strike launched 
by the UST has been suspended. The UST has therefore asked its 
members to return to work today. In return, the government has 
undertaken to suspend the notorious decree governing strikes in 
Chad until the establishment of institutions with the competence 
to abrogate or retain the decree. 
  The negotiators also said that the signing of the social 
pact 
-- the bone of contention -- will come into effect within a 
period not exceeding one month. The social pact, according to 
the UST, notably provides for a 35-percent salary increase, the 
payment of salary arrears, and the abrogation of the ordinance 
responsible for salary cuts since 1992. A unanimous agreement 
has not yet been reached on the terms of this social pact and 
the country has been paralyzed for more than a month now in 
order to have it signed. 
  Although the situation has only been temporarily defused, 
this is the first victory scored by the new government, which 
held its first meeting only yesterday. The president of the 
Republic said at yesterday's meeting that he would like the 
social pact to be concluded rapidly to enable the country to 
progress economically. [end recording]

  [Text] President Lissouba of the Congo has been a busy man. 
Yesterday, he had two separate meetings with his own supporters 
to give them a ticking off and with the opposition to float some 
radical ideas. The opposition has been giving the government a 
hard time since last year's controversial elections. There was 
a virtual civil war in Brazzaville between government and 
opposition militias for many months. On what President Lissouba 
had to say, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report from 
Brazzaville. 
  President Lissouba proposed that some form of power sharing 
agreement could be made based on the example of South Africa. 
He said: If blacks and whites can share power in South Africa, 
we too should be able to surmount our ethnic differences. 
President Lissouba has recently suggested that Congo could 
follow the example of South Africa by giving the main opposition 
leader the post of vice president. 
  Lissouba said he thought the Congolese Constitution, which 
is 
based on the French one, was unsuitable. He said this 
constitution, which gives everything to the winner of elections 
and nothing to the loser, runs against the Congolese spirit of 
negotiation and dialogue. The president asked his supporters in 
parliament to speed up the process of administrative 
decentralization, which would allow for some degree of power 
sharing with the opposition. 
  Lissouba criticized his supporters, saying they were wasting 
time with administrative details. He said they should just get 
on with decentralization. 
  Both opposition leaders and the president's supporters have 
responded favorably to his ideas on power sharing. Opposition 
leader Bernard Kolelas said Lissouba's proposals were extremely 
interesting.

  [Text] The chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Pierre 
Claver Maganga-Oussavou, gave a news conference this morning in 
which he reiterated his support for judicial and administrative 
recognition of the High Council of the Resistance [HCR]. This 
is in response to a statement by the deputy secretary general of 
the Gabonese Democratic Party in which he says the head of state 
should not recognize the HCR. Here is Mr. Maganga-Oussavou: 
  [Begin Maganga-Oussavou recording] The Gabonese opposition 
assembled within the HCR has never requested a judicial and 
administraive recognition. The right word here is political 
recognition. But what we have been told was that the opposition 
had asked Mr. Bongo for an administrative recognition which, as 
anybody knows, depends on the Interior Ministry. The Gabonese 
opposition is determined to engage in negotiations with the 
president. It wants to be recognized by the executive and the 
one in power now is Mr. Omar Bongo. 
  Otherwise, these negotiations, at least the preparatory 
phase, would have never been started. And this, without doubt, 
means political recognition. [end recording]

  [Text] In Rwanda, government forces have launched an 
offensive against the [Rwandan] Patriotic Front [RPF]. Their 
aim, according to a UN spokesman in Kigali, is to clear the road 
between the capital, Kigali, and Butare, south of it. 
  Violent fighting took place today. The government forces are 
concentrating their efforts north and south of Kigali. The 
evacuation of civilians in the town by the United Nations has 
been suspended because of a lack of gasoline. 
  In a separate development, the White Fathers have announced 
the killing of a Spanish missionary. He is believed to have 
been shot in the zone controlled by the RPF. Three other 
missionaries are still reported missing in the prefecture of 
Byumba, in the north of the country. That zone is controlled by 
the RPF.

  [Text] Kabuga, Rwanda, June 6 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels have 
repulsed a counter-attack by the government army near its 
stronghold south of Kigali, the commander of the Rwanda 
Patriotic Front (RPF) said here Monday [6 June]. 
  Speaking from this RPF bastion around 20 kilometres (12 
miles) east of Kigali, rebel commander General Paul Kagame said 
his forces had repelled "some counter attacks that I wouldn't 
call a counter-offensive" amid intense clashes in the Gitarama 
region. 
  He said rebel units were stationed three or four kilometres 
(about two miles) from Gitarama, a town around 50 kilometres (30 
miles) south of Kigali where the interim government has 
established its headquarters. 
  Earlier Monday Major Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the UN 
mission in Rwanda, said governement forces had launched a major 
counter-offensive around Gitarama and south toward the border 
with Burundi. 
  Kagame added that the RPF also held various sectors between 
Gitarama and the frontier.

  [Text] Rwanda's interim transport minister, Mr. Andre 
Ntagerura, has blamed Uganda for the escalating bloodshed in his 
country and called on President Nelson Mandela of South Africa 
to play a role in ending the conflict. 
  Addressing a news conference in Pretoria today, he accused 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is a Tutsi, of deploying 
40,000 troops in Rwanda. Tutsis and Hutus are involved in the 
tribal killings in the country. Mr. Ntagerura is in South 
Africa to brief the government on the current state of affairs 
in Rwanda and is scheduled to meet Mr. Mandela tomorrow. He 
expressed the hope that Mr. Mandela can use his influence to 
persuade Mr. Museveni to drop his support for the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF], which he blamed for the widespread human 
slaughter in his country. 
  Mr. Ntagerura also alleged that Mr. Museveni is also 
destabilizing the country by arming RPF troops. He further 
blamed the Belgian contingent of UN peace keepers for allowing 
the conflict to get out of hand in the first place, through what 
he claimed was their failure to control arms acquisitions by the 
RPF. He said due to a lack of supervision by the Belgians, the 
RPF grew to 2,000 heavily armed soldiers who infiltrated the 
entire country and sparked the current bloodshed by shooting 
down President Habyarimana's plane. 
  Mr. Ntagerura denied that the interim government is in 
hiding 
or has gone into exile, saying it is holding regular meetings in 
the capital, Kigali.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Smith: "The Mysteries of Goma, Zairian </F>
Refuge of Rwandan Killers"] 
  [Excerpt] Goma -- The 3.2-km-long runway at Goma airport is 
in great demand. First, it is a way out of the enclave of the 
North Kivu province, Zaire's own veritable vegetable garden. 
Then, because of the cargoes of manioc, yam, and beans, but 
also because of its passenger traffic, it maintains the national 
unity of a country-continent whose road and rail networks exists 
only on a map. At the end of the runway, between two planes, the 
youngsters have a soccer field which, despite the torrential 
rain, manages to remain unflooded for three-quarters of the 
year. Lastly, since the start of the Rwandan crisis, Goma 
airport has been the rear base of the government of neighboring 
Rwanda. It was from here that the leaders of the genocide were, 
until 10 days ago, kept supplied, notably with weapons. 
  Since the defeat of the Rwandan Armed Forces in Kigali on 
Sunday, 22 May, the "special flights" to Goma have stopped. 
Previously, a Boeing 707 with the registration number carefully 
wiped out would land at the airport five times daily, three 
times by day and twice at night. Its cargo each time was 18 
tonnes of weapons and munitions -- "from Serbia," some people 
said, while others claimed the cargo was shipped in crates 
stamped "Bulgaria." At least once witnesses claim to have seen 
South African pilots. Despite the abundance of details and 
sometimes contradictory versions, all the sources on the ground, 
including well-placed French expatriates, say that they are 
"certain" that these arms deliveries had been "paid for by 
France." However, no one is able to provide any evidence to 
back up this conviction. 
  When he recently received in Paris Faustin Twagiramungu, the 
prime minister-designate of a future Rwandan "government of 
national union," French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin came 
out against such accusations. He challenged his accuser to come 
up with proof. The defense attache of a French Embassy in the 
region also explained: "After having categorically turned down 
a request for military aid in mid-April, I cannot see the 
Balladur government sending weapons to Goma where, moreover, 
everything ends up being common knowledge." He added: 
"However, secret aid, by parallel circuits, is always possible. 
You know, I could tell you about arms agencies in Paris..." 
  Official France? Parallel France? Whether or not there has 
been French-Zairian collaboration in the Rwandan crisis, the 
fact remains that, thanks to the murderous conflagration in the 
neighboring country, Marshal-President Mobutu is remembered 
fondly in Paris. A French official said: "If Mobutu had been 
in the same plane as Juvenal Habyarimana," the Rwandan president 
killed in the attack on his plane on 6 April, "the whole of 
Africa would be ablaze and awash with blood." Apart from his 
"stabilizing role in the region," Paris has rediscovered the 
"French-speaking fidelity" of the Zairian leader, who 
nevertheless is still denied a visa for France and who has 
recently been threatened with the seizure of "all his ill-gotten 
gains acquired" abroad. "There is no longer any question of 
that," they say today. "We need Mobutu to keep Zaire steady and 
to confront Yoweri Museveni," the Ugandan president. Museveni 
is perceived as the Trojan Horse of "Anglo-Saxon interests in 
the region." One measure of the reconciliation is Francois 
Mitterrand's personal invitation to Mobutu to attend the next 
French-African summit in November in Biarritz, which has already 
been sent to the French Embassy in Kinshasa. "As soon as Mobutu 
forms a government and agrees to a few concessions, such as 
relinquishing control of the Bank of Zaire, it will be forwarded 
to him as a demonstration of gratitude." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kinshasa, 3 Jun (AFP) -- Representatives of France, 
Belgium, and the United States in Kinshasa delivered a common 
message today from their governments to Etienne Tshisekedi, the 
main opposition leader of the radical opposition in Zaire, it 
was learned from a reliable source today. The contents of the 
message was not revealed. The governments which make up this 
"troika" are from three countries that are said to be close to 
Zairian affairs. 
  The political situation is still confused in Zaire while 
people are awaiting the appointment of the new prime minister 
who will be in charge of managing the transition period to the 
Third Republic. 
  A special commission, set up by the High Council of the 
Republic- Transition Parliament [HCR-PT] to examine the various 
candidates submitted, was to submit its report today to the 
HCR-PT bureau. 
  The Zairian opposition, assembled within the Sacred Union of 
the Radical Opposition [USOR], is divided on this procedure and 
the conditions set up to designate the future prime minister. 
  USOR radicals believe that only Mr. Tshisekedi should be 
appointed prime minister because he was elected by the National 
Sovereign Conference in August 1992 and then dismissed by 
Marshal Mobutu. 
  An important USOR faction, led by the Union for the Republic 
and Democracy, said on its part that the post of prime minister 
has become "vacant" and presented three candidates for the post.

  [Text] Nairobi, June 5 (AFP) -- Kenyan opposition parties 
have formed a new alliance to fight future elections against 
President Daniel arap Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union 
(KANU) party. 
  The alliance, to be known as the United National Democratic 
Alliance (UNDA), was formed during a huge rally held at the 
historical Kamukunji grounds here Saturday [4 June], which was 
attended by 50 opposition members of parliament and their 
leaders. 
  During the rally, the first to be licenced by Moi's 
administration since the December 1992 first multi-party general 
elections in Kenya in 26 years, the opposition parties agreed to 
field one candidate against KANU in each of the seven 
constituencies in the forthcoming June 27 by-elections. 
  The seven by-elections follow recent defections to KANU of 
four opposition MPs, the death of two others, including father 
of the opposition and FORD [Forum for the Restoration of 
Democracy]-Kenya leader Oginga Odinga and former vice-president 
Josephat Karanja, and a court petition. 
  The rally was addressed by, among others, official 
opposition 
leader in parliament Michael Kijana Wamalwa of FORD-Kenya, 
Democratic Party chairman Mwai Kibaki, Kenya National Democratic 
Alliance (KENDA) chairman Mukaru Ng'ang'a and FORD-Asili vice- 
chairman George Nthenge. 
  Licences granted by administration to members of the 
opposition to hold political rallies throughout the country had 
hitherto been cancelled at the last minute and armed police 
ordered to break them up if organisers insisted on holding them. 
  There was, however, no sign of uniformed police at the rally 
on Saturday, as speaker after speaker attacked Moi's 
administration record and expressed unanimity about the need for 
a national convention to change the Constitution which they said 
was tailored for a one-party state, but was allowed to slip 
through by the 1992 multi-party euphoria. 
  The speakers said they were determined to see the current 
Electoral Commission replaced with an independent one on the 
line of those in South Africa and Malawi to serve all parties. 
In the event of failure they vowed to boycott the 1997 general 
elections. 
  But as the rally was being held in the capital, police were 
violently breaking up another rally at Nyamira in western Kenya, 
addressed by Kenya Social Congress (KSC) leader George Anyona, 
the Kenyan press reported here on Sunday. 
  At least seven people were injured as police stormed the 
rally, beating people on sight, the reports said.

  [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] has 
received information from high ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] sources in 
Monrovia of a diabolical plan to plant arms and ammunition in 
several locations in and around Monrovia, only to be discovered 
later by ECOMOG itself and subsequently falsely linked to the 
NPFL officials in Monrovia. According to the high-placed ECOMOG 
sources, the motive behind the secret agenda is to effect the 
arrest of several key NPFL officials in Monrovia, including Vice 
Chairman Isaac Musa, NPFL chief negotiator John T. Richardson, 
and others, falsely associating them with the hidden arms racket. 
  According to ECOMOG sources, these diabolical lies were 
brought to their attention by a certain official of the NPFL 
cabinet within the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional 
Government], who continues to demonstrate insincerity in 
disguise to undermine the NPFL. The NPFL says it has identified 
this minister in question and is questioning his motives for 
continuously promulgating lies and deception against the 
interests of the NPFL. 
  The leader of the NPFL, President Charles Gankay Taylor has 
strongly warned that if such a diabolical plan is carried out 
with the view of keeping Liberia continuously occupied by 
Nigeria, and its officials arrested in Monrovia, this will lead 
to the immediate resumption of war in Liberia.

  [Text] The leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front 
of Liberia] has expressed serious disgust over a publication by 
Nigeria related to the cost of their peacekeeping operation in 
Liberia. 
  Recently, a local daily reported that Nigeria has revealed 
spending some $4 billion [figure as received] on what they call 
peacekeeping activities in Liberia. President Taylor said he 
views the pronouncement seriously, noting that this may be one 
of the reasons why Nigeria does not want to leave Liberia. 
  The NPFL leader reminded Nigeria and the international 
community that Liberia is not for sale, and if Nigeria claims to 
have spent $4 billion here, and did not use the money wisely to 
bring about peace, Liberia should not be seen as a Nigerian 
savings bond for their continued perpetuation in this country. 
  President Taylor said Nigerian reference to spending $4 
billion here is sufficient cause to believe why the Nigerian 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] soldiers are behaving arrogantly and carrying 
acts of treachery in Liberia. Are the Nigerians saying they 
will not leave Liberia until we pay back the $4 billion -- 
president Taylor asked -- stressing that Liberia is not for sale. 
  The NPFL leader said the statement by the former Nigerian 
vice president, that Liberia has lost its sovereignty in the 
war, is manifesting itself by the attitude of the Nigerians, who 
have commercialized efforts to return peace to Liberia through 
arms sales, drug trafficking, and support for armed groups to 
delay the Liberian peace process. President Taylor said the 
NPFL, through its vision, with Almighty God, will continue to 
fight, watch, and die, if necessary, in the continued 
preservation of the sovereignty of Liberia.

  [Text] The chief of general staff, Lieutenant Colonel 
Oladipo Diya, has warned that the present administration has 
shown enough tolerance and will henceforth demonstrate in 
unmistakable terms that it is a military regime. 
  Gen. Diya gave the warning today in Kaduna, in separate 
addresses to traditional rulers and leaders of thought in the 
northern states. He reiterated that the government's tolerance 
in the face of provocations and confrontations by some selfish 
elements did not signify weakness, but a deliberate choice to 
demonstrate a high sense of maturity, to move the nation forward. 
  The chief of general staff said Nigerians might have been 
wondering why the government had tolerated the open 
confrontations against it, embarked upon by some people. The 
administration, he explained, was a child of circumstance, which 
came to save the country, and had used the method of dialogue to 
resolve issues. 
  Gen. Diya, however, noted that some persons, who claim to 
champion democracy, had maintained defiant attitude against 
constituted authority by mobilizing newspapers and magazines to 
publish falsehood, and openly abuse leaders to destabilize the 
government. He observed that these people were calling for open 
rebellion against the government and the installation of Chief 
Moshood Abiola as president. 
  Gen. Diya disclosed that at the inception of the 
administration, Chief Abiola himself recognized, supported, and 
gave advice on the formation of the cabinet, and even nominated 
some people for ministerial appointments. He therefore wondered 
at the turnaround and the threat by Abiola to install himself 
president by June 12 this year. The chief of general staff 
warned that the administration would firmly show commitment to 
peace and security of the nation. 
  Earlier, the Shehu of Bornu, (Alhaji Mustafa Omar el 
Kaneni), 
had reiterated the loyalty of northern traditional rulers to the 
Federal Government. About 40 of them attended the meeting with 
the chief of general staff, which was also attended by military 
administrators from the northern states.

  [Text] Lagos, June 6 (AFP) -- Nigerian police have arrested 
a fourth member of the country's dissolved Senate, which threw 
down a gauntlet to the junta last week by declaring itself in 
session, a senator told AFP on Monday [6 June]. 
  The security forces on Sunday detained Abu Ibrahim of the 
northern Katsina State, said ex-Senator Bola Tinubu, who was 
himself still being sought by police after the Senate declared 
the military regime illegal. 
  Speaking by cellular telephone from his hideaway after the 
arrests began at the weekend, Tinubu said that police officers 
had visited his Lagos home several times, demanding that he 
report to police headquarters. 
  Two other former senators, Polycarp Nwite and Okoroafor, 
were 
arrested and detained Saturday, respectively in Lagos and 
Abeokuta. 
  Tinubu is a founder member of the National Democratic 
Coalition (NADECO), a broad-based nationwide grouping of 
pro-democracy activists and rights movements which has called on 
General Sani Abacha's regime to stand down. 
  Another leading NADECO member, former Ogun State governor 
Segun Obosa, was arrested on Friday. 
  Several members of the National Assembly, which was also 
dissolved by Abacha after he seized power last November, pledged 
Sunday to show "solidarity" for the detained former speaker of 
the Senate, Ameh Ebute, whenever he is brought to court for 
trial. 
  "He is our leader and he deserves our moral support in his 
moment of travail," four of the ex-legislators told AFP in a 
telephone interview. They did not disclose what form the 
support would take but said it would be demonstrated around the 
court premises. 
  Detained ex-Senator Nwite, who spoke to AFP Sunday from his 
detention room on his cellular phone, alleged that the 
conditions under which he was being held were harsh. He 
complained that he had not been given food, water or a bed to 
sleep on. 
  Like the Senate, the National Assembly has called on Abacha 
to quit to pave the way for the installation of Moshood Abiola, 
the winner on unofficial results of last June's presidential 
election, which was annulled by the military junta of the time. 
  The government has described their action as "illegal, 
criminal and very dangerous." The Senate, in a meeting in 
defiance of a ban on political activity, has for its part 
labelled the junta "illegal." 
  The military regime plans to stage a constitutional 
conference over four months from June 27, which it describes as 
a key aspect of its own plans to restore power to elected 
civilians. 
  Pro-democracy activists have called for a boycott of the 
conference.

  [Text] Lagos, 6 Jun (AFP) -- Two former senators, including 
the former president of the Senate, which was dissolved by the 
Army, were today charged with "conspiracy and treason," an 
offense punishable by life imprisonment. The former senators 
have fallen victim to the determination of the Nigerian military 
regime, which has stepped up arrests to crush the opposition. 
  Former Senate President Ameh Ebute and former Senator 
Polycarp Nwite were charged today by the Federal High Court of 
Lagos. The presiding judge, Babatunde Belgore, refused bail 
with surety when requested by defense lawyers. He ordered them 
to be kept in detention until 22 June, when their trial will 
begin. 
  It also was learned today that, apart from the arrests that 
have already been reported -- four former senators and a former 
civilian governor -- Nigerian security forces are actively 
looking for other former national politicians. All political 
organizations and institutions were officially dissolved when 
General Sani Abacha took over power last November. Former 
Senator Bola Tinubu told AFP by telephone that the police came 
to his house several times and left a message for him to report 
to police headquarters as soon as possible. Since this call 
from his hiding place, all efforts to contact Bola Tinubu have 
been futile, and observers believe that it is quite probable 
that he has also been arrested. 
  According to information received from several sources by 
AFP, four members of the opposition -- Anthony Enahoro (former 
minister of information under General Gowon's administration - 
1966-1975), Michael Ajasin, Bola Ige, and John Oyegun, all three 
former civilian governors -- have been visited by police within 
the past 24 hours. Their fate was still not known this evening. 
Mr. A.A. Oriola, one of the defense lawyers for Messrs. Ebute 
and Nwite, told AFP that the main charge against the two accused 
was "conspiring to cause the overthrow of the head of state, 
Gen. Sani Abacha, from power." 
  On 1 June, the senators, in a communique signed by their 
president, declared the military government "illegal," and 
called for the formation of a government of national unity, led 
by Mashood Abiola. The two senators are the first to appear 
before a court since the beginning of the spate of arrests made 
by the Nigerian security forces within the ranks of the 
opposition. 
  Far from being intimidated by these arrests, the opposition, 
under the banner of the National Democratic Coalition, plans to 
go to Moshood Abiola's residence in Lagos and ask him to form 
his government, a member of the dissolved House of 
Representatives, who asked not to be named, told AFP today. 
  The Muslim billionaire, who is said to have won the 12 June 
1993 presidential elections, canceled by the Army, stated 
recently that he would form his government of national unity as 
soon as an assembly representing, according to him, the 
aspirations of the sovereign people, asks him to do so.

  [Text] A former presidential candidate, Chief Moshood 
Abiola, has appealed to his supporters to refrain from media 
attacks on the Hausa-Fulanis for his failure to become president 
of Nigeria. In an interview with newsmen at his Ikeja 
residence, Chief Abiola appealed to politicians, the media, and 
traditional rulers to prevail on their people to make more 
responsible utterances, in the interest of peace and national 
unity. He recalled that in the annulled presidential elections 
he won more support in Kano than Ogun, his home state, stressing 
that such people deserve better treatment than attacks on pages 
of newspapers.

  [Text] Lagos, 6 June (PANA) -- The political temperature in 
Nigeria remained high Monday [6 June] with a report that 
millionaire Moshood Abiola is seeking the support of the United 
States Government in his bid to be installed as president of the 
West African country. Abiola; who claimed victory [word 
indistinct] 12 June 1993 presidential election, which was 
annulled by former military ruler, General Ibrahim Babangida, 
was quoted by the Nigerian press as having requested 
Washington's recognition for the government he wants to announce 
before 12 June. 
  In the letter to the U.S. Vice President Al Gore, extracts 
of 
which were reproduced by three Nigerian newspapers, Abiola asked 
for the U.S. Government to: 

  -  "Warn the military junta not to kill pro-democracy group 
members, labour leaders, women, students and others who plan to 
demonstrate or engage in stay at home activity". 
  -  "Condemn the military regime" for "arresting Ameh Ebute", a 
former president of Nigeria's disbanded senate. 
  -  "Sustaining the ban on visas and all official contacts with 
the 
dictators," and 
  -  "Despatch a special envoy of the President (Bill Clinton) to 
monitor Nigeria's final transition to democracy". 


    In the letter which Abiola signed as "president-elect", 
published in its entirety by the VANGUARD newspaper, he said: 
"It has become clear that the military regime has no intention 
of relieving its gruesome oppression of the people, but rather 
intends to stay in power and continue the public rape of 
Nigeria's precious resources". But a spokesman of the American 
Embassy in Lagos today denied comments Monday when PANA sought 
clarification on the letter which Abiola reportedly wrote on 3 
June to Washington. It was not clear whether the published 
letter was sent directly to Washington D.C., the U.S. capital. 
  The United States and a number of European countries, 
including Britain have imposed limited sanctions, such as visa 
restrictions on Nigerian Government officials, moratorium on 
official aid and suspension of military assistance, following 
the annulment of the 1993 presidential election. Abiola, a 
multimillionaire businessman, who ran a similar but largely 
unsuccessful campaign which took him to the United States and 
some European countries for 53 days in 1993, has threatened to 
form a rival government to the present military regime of 
General Sani Abacha. Abacha took power on 17 November 1993 
following the surprise resignation of Ernest Shonekan, head of 
the Babangida-appointed interim national government in the heat 
of political crisis unleashed by the annulment of the 12 June 
presidential election. On taking power, the Abacha regime 
dissolved all political institutions including elected local 
councils, national and state assemblies, and the two political 
parties, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National 
Republican Convention (NRC). Caretaker committees have been 
appointed for the local councils by the regime, which plans a 
national constitutional convention to begin on 27 June ahead of 
the unbanning of politics on 17 January 1995, as part of is 
transition to civilian rule. 
  But some political associations, notably, the National 
Democratic Coalition (NADECO), are opposed to the conference and 
want the military to relinquish power to Abiola. The military 
government has responded by saying that the constitutional 
conference must go ahead and warned that trouble makers would be 
dealt with. A NADECO member, Segun Osoba, a former civilian 
governor of Nigeria's western state of Ogun, Abiola's home 
state, was arrested Friday by security agents. The VANGUARD 
reported that government was preparing treason charges against 
former Senate President Ebute. He was arrested Thursday for 
allegedly convening a meeting of the disbanded Senate. Ebute was 
reported to have issued a statement after the meeting, asking 
the military administration, which he described as an "illegal" 
regime to quit. 
  But it appears not all pro-democracy groups are in full 
support of NADECO's position, judging by press reports Monday. 
A spokesman of human rights group, the Campaign for Democracy 
(CD), which led a series of crippling disobedience strikes in 
1993 over the annulled 12 June presidential election, is 
reported in several newspapers as saying that CD's support for 
Abiola's cause is conditional. "If we must genuinely restore 
June 12 mandate and support Abiola, we must impose conditions, 
because the SDP and NRC have failed to justify the people's 
confidence. "The political class has betrayed us," Lagos lawyer 
and CD member Femi Falana, said. Abiola, he said, "could no 
longer form a government of national unity on the basis of the 
defunct political parties... Because the parties have become 
moribund while politicians have since pitched their tent with 
the military government." The Nigerian Labour Congress, the 
country's umbrella labour movement, is reported by newspapers to 
have opposed the idea of a rival government by Abiola. The 
congress' central working committee reportedly met Friday in 
Lagos, and resolved that solutions to the country's current 
political crisis could be achieved through the planned 
constitutional conference.

<F P=106> [By Rod MacJohnson] </F>
  [Text] Koidu, Sierra Leone, June 5 (AFP) -- Exactions 
against civilians by the Sierra Leone army in its three year war 
against rebels have resulted in the troops failing to win the 
hearts and minds of the people, their new commander said here on 
a recent inspection tour of the front lines. 
  Colonel Kelly Conteh was appointed chief of the general 
staff 
in April on his emergence from a Ghanaian military college, with 
the job of shaking up the Armed Forces. 
  "What I have discovered after taking office is that the 
Army's inability to win civilian support is due to its negative 
actions, including harassment, seizure of civilian properties 
and arbitrating in civil matters," Konteh said in an interview 
in this diamond centre 250 kiLometres (150 miles) east of 
Freetown. 
  As a result, "we know of instances where civilians have 
openly collaborated with rebel elements, giving them food and 
(allowing) them to mine diamonds for their own benefit," he said. 
  "We are also studying claims of people giving information of 
strategic locations to the rebels." 
  Following his appointment, Conteh appealed for new recruits 
to the Armed Forces to help restore peace in the country, but he 
said that much of the current trouble stemmed from people being 
taken on without proper checks of their records. 
  "We shall weed out the undesirables," he said, vowing that 
he 
would not compromise in whipping the army into shape. 
  "I want to head an Army that has an unblemished record and 
keep on the side of protecting the nation," Conteh said. 
  He claimed that the civil war between the military-led 
government and the United Revolutionary Front was all but over, 
despite continued reports of violent attacks by the rebels. 
  "I cannot give a time frame but I doubt whether we would be 
talking about the war in six months' time," he said. 
  But in the displaced persons' camp at Goindama, 120 
kilometres southwest of Koidu, the largest in the country, the 
200,000 inmates no longer believe in such assurances. 
  Humanitarian aid workers said that more than half of them 
were in their third period at Goindama. Twice before, they had 
left to go home at the invitation of the government, only to be 
forced to return by rebel action. 
  "We are fed up with coming and going," a former teacher 
complained.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Cuito] </F>
  [Text] Until early this evening an unspecified number of 
civilians had been killed and 47 wounded since the start of the 
shellings this morning. Snipers fired at residents throughout 
the day as they ventured into the streets to search for food, 
water, and firewood. The situation in Cuito could be described 
as critical. Unable to challenge government forces, Jonas 
Savimbi's men fire shells into the city and at civilians. The 
latter have gone without food and medicines since emergency 
relief operations have been discontinued. The number of people 
killed as a result of the shellings is on the increase. A 
civilian died of starvation at (Cangota) Ward this afternoon. 
Should the relief program not resume soon, more people are 
likely to die of starvation.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] has intensified its shelling of Cuito over the 
past 24 hours. Cuito no longer receives humanitarian 
assistance, and the food situation has worsened. Our 
correspondent Abel Abraao has further details. 
  [Begin Abraao recording] Wounded and hungry people in Cuito 
have been begging for humanitarian assistance. The political 
and military situation has not experienced major changes here in 
Cuito over the past hours. UNITA rebels continue to shell the 
city, after experiencing heavy defeats in direct clashes with 
government forces. 
  Despite heavy defeats, Jonas Savimbi's men are still 
determined to overrun Cuito. Over the past 12 hours, more than 
2,000 shells of various calibers were fired on the city, 
interspersed with infantry attacks. 
  Meanwhile, more than 500,000 wounded and hungry people are 
begging for humanitarian assistance from international 
organizations. People are already dying of hunger in large 
numbers. International humanitarian organizations have not been 
flying to Cuito for the past 10 days because of military 
instability in this region. Since the war began on 26 May, more 
than 400 civilians have died, most of them old people, women, 
and children. [end recording]

  [Text] In Bengo Province UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] soldiers tried to seize a number 
of government positions, paying dearly for their adventure. In 
three attacks and in one clash with the FAA [Angolan Armed 
Forces] between 13 and 30 May, UNITA abandoned 71 killed on the 
ground, and four of its men were captured. The FAA captured 60 
AKM's, four PKM's, two 60-mm mortars, one RPG-7, one antitank 
missile, 82,000 rounds of ammunition of various caliber, and 
other military equipment. Seven UNITA soldiers turned 
themselves over to government forces during the same period. 
They revealed that right now UNITA intends to recapture the 
locations of Ucua and Gombe and to destroy the bridge over the 
[name indistinct] river. The FAA has already taken measures to 
deal with the situation.

  [Text] The Angolan people are still victims of air raids 
carried out by aircraft of Eduardo dos Santos' government, an 
authoritarian, communist and warmongering government. 
Yesterday, when the [word indistinct] commemorated 50 years of 
the defeat of Nazi dictatorship, Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] aircraft did the same 
thing that Adolf Hitler did, killing civilians in the small Vila 
Nova District. Lourenco Bento, Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of 
the Black Cockerel] journalist in the area, reports that napalm 
and fragmentation bombs were dropped over civilian targets, 
causing considerable human and material losses. The aircraft 
which bombed Vila Nova yesterday came from Catumbela Airport. 
  This is the way the Luanda government wages war in Angola, 
increasing the number of deaths almost all over. A total of 37 
were killed in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul Provinces over the past 
two days, victims of indiscriminate air raids carried out by the 
MPLA air force. The affected areas were Mutala, Cacolo, and 
Cuilo in Lunda Sul Province, and Cambulo, Lunda Norte Province. 
On 4 and 5 June, war planes of Engineer Eduardo dos Santos' 
organization had attacked civilians in Capenda-Camulemba 
District, Lunda Norte. 
  Meanwhile, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FALA] Command in the northeast area said yesterday that the air 
raids were a demonstration of phobia, peculiar to cowards and 
anti-democratic forces. 
  The MPLA-PT forces waging an offensive in Cabinda against 
areas liberated by UNITA in that area rich in oil, were defeated 
over the weekend. Vorgan correspondent in Cabinda Americo 
Chivala reports that at dawn on 3 June the counter-attacking 
UNITA forces took effective control of Ganda Cango District and 
the bridge over [name indistinct] River on the way to Buco Zau. 
There were about 1,200 MPLA troops led by General Jose de Pedro 
and they left 24 confirmed killed on the ground and considerable 
lethal materiel including 27 AKM weapons, two 60 mm mortars with 
86 shells, three RPG-7 rocket launchers with 14 rockets, 19 
AK-47 ammunition boxes, 13 PKM ammunition boxes. 
  Yesterday, the situation was calm in Ganda Cango, however, a 
source from the FALA Military Command said the troops were in a 
maximum state of alert.

  [Text] Angola is violating the sovereignty of Namibia with 
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] secret police involved in the compulsory recruitment 
of Angolan nationals taking refuge in northern Namibia. This 
has been taking place since 4 May with the consent of the 
Namibian authorities, and the Angolan consul in the city of 
Rundu, the capital of Okavango Province. With the current 
compulsory recruitment, hundreds of youths have just been flown 
to Luanda, but the campaign continues and is scheduled to reach 
2,400 men. The Bagani, Omege, Mukwe, Andara, Kangongo, and 
Chobe areas are currently the most affected. In February the 
Namibian president guaranteed that his country would defend the 
international rights of the refugees, but it seems that this is 
no longer so, since he is assisting the Luanda communist 
government.

  [Text] Blantyre, June 6 (AFP) -- Malawi's Alliance for 
Democracy [AFORD] says it has abandoned talks with the ruling 
United Democratic Front [UDF] and is now formulating a working 
alliance with the Malawi Congress Party of ex-president Kamuzu 
Banda. 
  Alliance (AFORD) second vice-president Rev. Peter Kaleso on 
Monday told AFP in an interview that talks with MCP were 
advanced and "we are waiting to write a letter of understanding." 
  Kaleso said the talks were initiated by the Congress Party 
(MCP) after AFORD twice failed to reach an accord with the Front 
(UDF) on forming a coalition government after last month's first 
democratic elections. 
  AFORD, led by outspoken trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, had 
demanded some key ministerial portfolios. 
  "We think we can make a good opposition with MCP and we will 
give UDF a tough time in parliament because they will always be 
outvoted," Kaleso said, adding that his party's aim was to see 
that democracy thrived. 
  "We don't want to end with one big party and destroy the 
rest. We would end up being a one-party state," he said. 
  Aford won 36 seats, the MCP 55 and the UDF 84. The UDF is 
five seats short of a working majority in parliament. 
  Chihana -- who has called MCP a party of death and darkness 
-- was quoted recently as saying it was better to convert the 
devil to work with them. 
  MCP's publicity secretary Hetherwick Ntaba confirmed in a 
newspaper interview that talks with AFORD were under way. 
  "Yes we are having talks with AFORD... We should be 
finalising the discussions in the course of next week," he told 
the DAILY TIMES published on Monday.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There were signs of growing disagreement among 
leaders of Malawi's Aford [Alliance for Democracy] opposition 
party, which came second in last month's elections won by the 
United Democratic Front [UDF] of President Bakili Muluzi. 
Yesterday, on this program, one of Aford's founder member, 
Victor Ndove, criticized the party's leader, Chakufwa Chihana, 
both for his personal style and for his handling of negotiations 
with the UDF over the formation of the new government. He even 
accused the Aford leadership of holding talks with the ousted 
Malawi Congress Party, the MCP. On the Line to Mangochi, Chris 
Greene asked Aford's Secretary General Dr. (Mucky Mtewa) how he 
responded to Victor Ndove's criticism. 
  [Begin recording] [(Mtewa)] First, of course, on a personal 
note, I have tremendous respect for my good friend Victor Ndove. 
In responding to the concern of the good founder, is that, of 
course, the position taken by President Chakufwa Chihana, on 
behalf of this party, in wanting to preserve the integrity of 
his members in parliament, and of course, definitely, the 
intricate structure of consultation within the Alliance for 
Democracy, was to make sure that everything else, as much as 
possible, was democratically conducted and that we were giving 
away the party or delivering our members in parliament to the 
UDF government, without knowing precisely the conditions and 
terms which would be acceptable to our members within the party. 
  [Greene] But, in fact, you failed to negotiate yourselves 
into the governing coalition and you are now just a minor 
opposition party. 
  [(Mtewa)] No, that is not...[pauses] I think I must have 
said 
about 48 hours ago that the negotiations and the talking still 
continue and nothing has been terminated yet, contrary to those 
perceptions. 
  [Greene] Is it true that you are also negotiating with the 
former ruling MCP party? 
  [(Mtewa)] Negotiating would be the wrong term. I am not sure 
what we are negotiating about. I think we are talking to all 
individuals in the country, as Malawians, given the (?need for) 
the preservation of the delicate balance of democracy in this 
country. On matters of common interest, should those happen to 
coincide at all in the debate on legislation introduced by 
government, we will be expected to consult and talk to those 
other members of the other party on how best to approach those 
issues of common interest. Talking now, of course, is purely a 
matter of friendship. They are both friends and that they were 
never enemies. They just happened to be members in the 
government at the time, as, I am sure, the UDF gentlemen 
happened to be members of that government for many years. 
  [Greene] That is a very conciliatory language from you, 
given 
the sorts of things that Chakufwa Chihana said after he came out 
of prison? 
  [(Mtewa)] Definitely, also conciliatory in terms of the 
personal life of this secretary general. For the record, of 
course, both my parents are crippled by the Malawi Congress 
Party government. I think you can say, at least, in politics we 
grow fast and we learn the hard way. [end recording]

  [Text] Lilongwe June 6 SAPA -- Three million people will 
need emergency food aid in 1994/95 following widespread crop 
failure in central and southern Malawi, the United Nations Food 
Aid Organisation [FAO] said on Monday [6 June]. A recent 
FAO/World Food Programme crop assessment mission blamed the crop 
failure on erratic and insufficient rainfall. 
  This year's cereal production among smallholders is 
estimated 
to be 60 per cent less than last year's bumper harvest, and only 
28 per cent higher than in 1991/92, when drought devasted 
southern Africa. The mission estimated about 493,000 tons of 
cereals would have to be imported. 
  Of the cereal food aid requirement, about 175,000 tons would 
be needed as emergency assistance for some three million people. 
Another 270,000 tons would be required to be sold in the market 
to stabilise food supply and prices. 
  "Food scarcity in the markets leads to riots, hoarding and 
skyrocketing prices. That happened during the big drought of 
1992. We attach equal importance to keeping the commercial 
sector well-supplied," said WFP Director Phillip Ostenso. 
  Despite a bumper harvest last year, Malawi has not recovered 
from the massive 1991/92 drought. The sharp decline in the 
production of major crops such as tobacco and cotton due to 
drought means reduced incomes for many rural households. 
  Malnutrition rates have always been very high in Malawi, 
even 
with good harvests. Studies suggest more than half of rural 
pre-school children suffer from chronic malnutrition. Thus food 
shortages and high prices can quickly aggravate an already 
critical situation. 
  Although landlocked, Malawi proved in the 1991/92 drought it 
was adequately equipped to handle the transportation, storage 
and internal distribution of large volumes of food imported 
through South Africa, Mozambican or, possibly, Tanzanian ports 
[words indistinct].

  [Text] An alleged agreement in terms of which the 
Mozambican Government will give an Indian spiritual leader, 
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, nearly a quarter of the country is 
causing controversy. Government sources say plans are being laid 
to amend the stipulations of the agreement. The agreement was 
allegedly signed by the finance minister with the agreement of 
President Joaquim Chissano. Latest speculation is that 20 
million hectares of land is being made available to the 
maharishi for his Heaven on Earth Development Company. The 
maharishi is the former spiritual leader of the Beatles.

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Lima] </F>
  [Excerpts] After the introduction of the Indicative 
Prospective Plan, the project of the Decade of Victory Over 
Backwardness, the megalomaniac 400,000-hectare project in Niassa 
and Cabo Delgado Provinces, when everyone thought the government 
had cognizance of the situation, the Mozambican Government has 
decided to create a "paradise on earth." 
  Finance Minister Dr. Eneas Comiche, representing the 
Mozambican Government, signed an agreement with the Maharishi 
Heaven on Earth Development Corporation BV (Mahedco) [company's 
name in English] based in Holland on 6 July 1993. 
  The agreement was signed one day after President Joaquim 
Chissano's departure from Holland where he received in Vlodrop, 
Mahedco's headquarters, a Honoris Causa Doctorate Degree from 
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the oriental guru who is behind 
"paradises on earth" projects. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Terms of the Agreement </H5>
  Terms and Conditions of the Agreement for the Establishment 
of an Integrated Project in Mozambique called "Paradise on Earth 
Project": 
  The main aim of this agreement is to promote the 
implementation of the project...through the following programs: 
  1. To improve the quality of life, including health care and 
education, as well as significantly improve the per capita 
income of Mozambican citizens and the whole country's economic 
growth; 
  2. To optimize the development of agriculture, horticulture, 
floriculture, etc., in order to increase foreign exchange 
revenue and achieve self-sufficiency in domestic production; 
  3. To create agricultural and industrial enterprises to 
produce different kinds of products, including dairy products 
for domestic and foreign markets; 
  4. To establish industries that would offer high quality 
alternative products to replace imports, as well as establish 
alternative nonpollutant industries. 
  5. To establish mining enterprises in the country for 
greater 
mining production and exploration. 
  6. To promote integrated agricultural and forest projects in 
a responsible manner so as to protect the environment; 
  7. To develop basic social infrastructure, housing, roads, 
schools, hospitals, power supply, communications, cities, and 
villages. 
  8. To develop other areas of mutual interest. 
  The agreement's preamble refers to the government's duty to 
guarantee "quick development without increasing foreign debt and 
dependence from abroad" as well as the company's commitment to 
obtain financing "avoiding as much as possible using substantial 
funds coming from the international financing market in order 
not to expose the country to unnecessary economic pressures." 
<H5>  The Allocation of Areas and Operation Rights for the Project </H5>
  To implement the Paradise on Earth Project...the government 
will allocate unutilized land in the Provinces of Niassa, Cabo 
Delgado, Tete, Gaza, Inhambane for agriculture, silviculture, 
and reforestation. For the continued development of the 
project, the company will apply for necessary licenses in 
accordance with the specific legislation in force governing 
economic activities in Mozambique, particularly the Land and 
Mineral Resources Law. 
  The government grants the company all operation rights for a 
period of 50 years, which will be renewable. Relevant 
regulations will also apply to all other kinds of activity. 
<H5>  General Responsibilities of the Parties </H5>
  The company undertakes to organize and supply all "know 
how", 
train local staff, provide basic social infrastructure and 
promotion and export services, as well as all other activities 
needed in the project. 
  The company will organize foreign financing needed to 
implement the project. The servicing of the debt used in 
financial undertakings of the project will be covered by the 
money obtained from the exports and the sale in Mozambique of 
products generated by the project. 
  The company will organize the supply of necessary tractors 
and other equipment which does not exist in the country for 
agriculture and mining exploration, and technicians specializing 
in the building of infrastructure needed for the project. 
  The company will have the right to contract technicians from 
anywhere in the world to develop the project and guarantee the 
training of local farmers. 
  The company is responsible for the implementation of the 
project. 
  The government must guarantee that land is available for the 
project as well as all the relevant information required for the 
project. 
  The Center for Investment Promotion (CPI) will make 
available 
services to facilitate the company's negotiations with the 
government. 
<H5>  Training, Education, and Health </H5>
  All the education and training of people taking part in the 
project at all levels will be provided by and in accordance with 
the principles and regulations of national and international 
institutions under Mahedco. The company will establish in 
Mozambique educational institutions at different levels to 
educate Mozambicans at all levels, including primary, secondary, 
and professional levels. 
  Within the framework of the national health policy, the 
company will implement a system of health care, based on the 
traditional system of natural medicine (on the basis of herbs 
and medicinal plants), the Maharishi Ayur-Ved system. 
<H5>  Incentives </H5>
  The government will grant the following rights and 
incentives 
to the company: 

  -  all export incentives, as well as the exemption of taxes 
on export and import of equipment, imported material for 
investment in the project, and raw materials to produce exports. 
  -  exemption of circulation tax and excise duty for the 
equipment 
and material imported for investment in the project. 
  -  reduction by 50 percent of industrial tax (CI) and 
supplementary tax, not exceeding 10 years after the beginning of 
production in each one of the operations. 
  -  at the expiry of 10 years, the investments in Niassa, Cabo 
Delgado, and Tete will benefit from an additional reduction of 
50 percent in industrial tax for a period of six years (Niassa) 
and three years (Cabo Delgado and Tete). The investments in 
Gaza and Inhambane will benefit from a reduction of 25 percent 
in industrial tax for an additional period of two years. 
  -  costs incurred by the company in the development of 
infrastructure in the country will be reduced from taxes to be 
paid. 
  -  costs incurred in the training of Mozambican workers may be 
deducted from the amount subject to industrial tax up to a 
maximum limit of 5 percent of that taxable amount. 
  -  capital, loans, and interests will be tax-exempt. 


<H5>    Cessation of the Agreement </H5>
  If the agreement is terminated by the relevant authorities, 
or in case of expropriation, revocation, or suspension, the 
company has the right to commercial compensation, as defined by 
just market criteria. 
  The text of the agreement, also signed by Mahedco's 
Executive 
Director Dr. Jacques Uijen, does not define the investment sum 
for the implementation of the Paradise on Earth in Mozambique. 
<H5>  A Paradise With 20 Million Hectares </H5>
  For a country with 80 million hectares of land, 20 million 
hectares signify a quarter of the national territory, simple 
arithmetic. 
  Twenty million hectares is the size of land that Mahedco 
intends to explore in Mozambique. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Projects Reconverted </H5>
  In the midst of silence and embarrassment from a number of 
government officials, the Investment Promotion Center assured 
SAVANA that the agreement signed with Mahedco is not being 
implemented. 
  "The project is being renegotiated at present," an official 
from the Investment Promotion Center told us. Without providing 
details, he said the present philosophy is to impel Mahedco to 
support "people with land rights." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The discrepancy in the figure of Mozambique Armed 
Forces [FAM] troops is reaching alarming proportions. 
Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] Chairman Pier Giorgio Segala feels 
the problem can no longer be resolved at the CCF level and he 
has submitted it to the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC]. 
  MEDIAFAX has obtained two documents connected with this 
matter: A memorandum from Segala to the CSC, dated 25 May 1994, 
and a government reaction to this memorandum, dated 26 May 1994 
and signed by Brigadier Joao Aleixo Malunga, head of the 
government delegation to the CCF. 
  The issue in question is this: Has the government or has it 
not hidden some of its troops? The memorandum from Segala 
outlines: 
  -- On 5 May 1994, Minister Teodato Hunguana told the CSC 
that 
the government delegation to the CCF informed the CSC on 9 
November 1992 that the government had 61,638 troops to be 
confined and that it would provide later the number of 
government troops in centers for nonconfined troops. 
  -- On 18 March 1993, Lieutenant Genearal Hama Thai 
"presented 
to the United Nations figures produced by the Defense Ministry's 
Logistical Department" with a view to providing provisions for 
the confined 61,638 FAM troops. Hama Thai stressed that the 
61,638 troops do not include troops in centers for nonconfined 
troops. 
  -- On 26 April 1993, the government signed "a memorandum of 
understanding" with the World Food Program to provide food aid 
to 62,000 troops in 29 assembly areas. The memorandum adds: In 
November 1993 the government presented to the "CCF the first 
figure of government troops in centers for nonconfined troops. 
The figure was 14,849 troops. 
  -- Beginning December 1993, in daily reports, issued by the 
Technical Unit of the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz], "it 
is repeatedly stressed" that the government will confine 61,638 
troops. Thus, until 20 April 1994, the correct figures 
presented to Unomoz were: 61,638 troops for assembly areas and 
14,849 troops for centers for nonconfined troops. "The 
government did not object to these figures". 
  On 21 April 1994 the government informed the CCF that the 
total number of troops in assembly areas and centers for 
nonconfined troops is 64,118. Within 24 hours a total of 12,369 
troops were missing. 
  "Since the figure of government troops in centers for 
nonconfined troops had changed by only 369 troops, from 14,849 
in November 1993 to 14,480 in April 1994, the new figure was 
accepted, leaving a total of 12,000 troops missing." 
  After the issue was submitted to the CSC, it returned to the 
CCF on 5 May 1994. Since then the CCF has held four meetings to 
discuss the issue. "All these meetings were unfruitful," Segala 
says in his letter to the UN's Aldo Ajello. 
  Segala's memorandum goes on to say: 
  "At the first CCF meeting on 5 May 1994, the head of the 
government delegation explained the discrepancy of 12,000 men, 
referring to difficulties in updating the figures of serving 
troops during the period of war in a country facing serious 
logistical problems. He said the figures of government troops 
are being constantly reexamined. He said the specific reasons 
for the discrepancy include the time gap between the event on 
the field (for example the death of a soldier) and the time the 
event is registered in different books kept by the Ministry of 
Finance, the Defense Ministry's Logistic Department, and the FAM 
Supreme Command; the tendency by camp commanders to inflate the 
figures of troops under their command in order to obtain more 
provisions for the troops; the tendency of some officers to 
inflate the number of troops under their command in order to 
pocket the salaries of nonexistent troops; and the practice of 
not removing the names of demobilized troops from the salary 
list until their military pensions have been fixed." 
  Segala's memorandum points out that if this discrepancy does 
not only appear in relation to confinement and demobilization 
processes, then similar discrepancies should be observed in the 
total number of troops registered in the Ministries (of Finance 
and Defense) in August 1992. 
  "A well-documented statement by the government that 
discrepancies [words indistinct] to the figures presented for 
assembly areas and demobilizaation would greatly help to calm 
people's concerns that troops are being hidden or kept in 
reserve." 
  Segala says in his memorandum that Brig. Malunga agreed "to 
try to find out whether there is an original document proving 
the transfer of government troops to the police force." 
  At the CCF meeting held on 13 May 1994 Malunga said the 
issue 
could not be resolved because relevant specialists were "out of 
Maputo." The CCF met again on 23 May 1994. At that meeting, 
Malunga refused the proposal that the government should prepare 
a well-documented statement with the discrepancies, pointing out 
that the problem was just a mere question of interpretation." 
  "In conclusion, Malunga said that the issue of whether or 
not 
the government was hiding troops would come to light at the end 
of the demobilization process because it would be known whether 
the government left any troops on the field." 
  The fourth CCF meeting scheduled for 24 May 1994 did not 
take 
place because of the absence of the Renamo representative. 
  Segala concludes his memorandum by saying: "I lament to 
inform you that the CCF has exhausted all its possibilities for 
resolving the matter. I am, therefore, forced to submit it to 
the CSC for urgent attention". 
  On 26 May 1994 Brig. Malunga addressed a written protest to 
Segala, demanding that the issue be returned to the CCF. 
  The government delegation to the CCF said Segala [words 
indistinct] true contents of the discussions on the issue. The 
protest letter describes the decision by Segala to submit the 
issue to the CSC as not a "very dignified" decision. 
  As far as the government is concerned, Segala's role is 
"exclusively" that of a CCF "moderator" and a "trustworthy 
reporter" of what is taking place. "In the General Peace Accord 
there is no room for unilateral actions and deductions by the 
CCF chairman without, at the very least, obtaining a consensus 
from the parties". 
  The government's protest letter says that by transferring 
the 
issue to the CSC, Segala created "serious doubts" about his 
"real intentions." What is more, he did not wait for a reply 
from the head of the Renamo delegation. "The real party 
interested in this problem is not Renamo as we are constantly 
made to understand." 
  "Segala's role in this particular case should not be to 
heighten contradictions between the parties." 
  The letter goes on to say that the government delegation to 
the CCF "is deeply astonished by the pressure, something 
strange, applied in unison and concerted manner against the 
government over discrepancies in the figure of its troops, as if 
this was a problem that only affected the government." 
  The protest letter reiterates that the government "does not 
have and it has never had any intention to hide troops."

  [Text] Brigadier Raul Dique from the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] has denied reports that he was detained and 
assaulted by his troops in the Mocubela assembly area in 
Zambezia Province. He denied the report in a telephone 
interview with Radio Mozambique on his return to Maputo from 
Zambezia. 
  [Begin recording] [Dique] It is true that I was in Mocubela. 
On my return to Maputo via Beira I was surprised by reports 
appearing in the media. In Beira, there are reports that I am 
dead, and here in Maputo, there are reports that I was beaten 
and so on. That is not true. It is true that I left for Beira 
aboard a UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] plane on 1 June. 
From Beira, I left for Mocubela by helicopter. There was a 
small agitation by Renamo troops there. The reason for this was 
that a Unomoz monitor stationed at the assembly area told the 
troops waiting to be demobilized that they would receive a 
subsidy of 75,000 meticals for six months instead of 35,000 
meticals for three months. 
  When the demobilization team went to Mocubela and began 
paying 35,000 meticals for three months for a simple soldier, 
the troops were infuriated because the Unomoz monitor had always 
told them that they would receive 75,000 meticals for six 
months. They asked for clarification and they rioted against 
the demobilization team. 
  When I received the information, I went there and clarified 
the matter. I told them that the monitor was wrong and that the 
truth was that they should receive 35,000 meticals for three 
months. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] But we received information 
that 
you were assaulted. Is that true? 
  [Dique] I was not assaulted. I am in very good shape. I 
wish the people in the media could see me physically. I was not 
beaten. The truth is that when the troops became infuriated they 
surrounded their commander and people thought that he was being 
assaulted. That is not true. I can present myself to the media 
at any time and you will see that I am in good shape, without 
any wounds or bruises. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by President Joaquim Chissano at a National Frelimo </F>
Cadres Meeting in Maputo on 31 May--published as an 
advertisement] 
  [Text] Comrade members of the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] Central Committee, comrade militants and cadres of 
Frelimo, comrades, 
  It is with great emotion that I convey the most fraternal 
and 
warmest greetings to all the comrades coming from different 
corners of the country and different sectors of national 
activity. 
  The present National Frelimo Cadres Meeting is taking place 
during a crucial moment in the life of our people, particularly 
in the life of our party. 
  We say crucial because of the immense and urgent tasks that 
we face today. With peace, we have gained renewed hope to 
reconstruct Mozambique, to normalize the life of each citizen, 
and to follow the steady path of development, democracy, and 
progress for all our people, firm and united as always. 
  We say crucial because the wishes and aspirations of our 
people, affirmed in our political ideals, will only be realized 
if there is a strong and competent government after the October 
elections, if the elected Assembly of the Republic is truly 
representative of our people's political and cultural diversity, 
and if the president -- to be elected by the people -- 
represents and intends to realize these political ideals. 
  It is crucial, therefore, that our party emerge convincingly 
victorious in the coming general multiparty elections. 
  It is clear to us that Frelimo's victory in the coming 
elections is a national necessity, a patriotic cause which goes 
far beyond political party limits and interests. 
  What we are going to do here, esteemed comrades, is to 
prepare and organize our victory. We are going to prepare and 
organize a better future for our people. 
  Our mission and pledge before all of our countrymen: to 
provide a better future for each and every Mozambican, with more 
hospitals, more schools, more workplaces, more houses, and 
better working conditions in factories and farms. 
  This path that we have to thread is already reflected in the 
immense work we have carried out since we gained peace for our 
people with wisdom and patience: hundreds of kilometers of 
roads have been opened or repaired; dozens of bridges have been 
rebuilt; hundreds of hospitals and schools have been rebuilt and 
new schools and health posts built; factories and other 
production centers have resumed production; more than 800,000 
Mozambicans who lived as refugees in neighboring countries have 
returned to the fatherland and about three million people who 
lived as displaced people inside the country have normalized 
their lives. 
  All these things reinforce our conviction that we are on the 
right path and that the hope that our people have today is 
strengthening their desire to participate in the reconstruction 
of Mozambique. We have to know how to use all this potential 
knowledge, experience, and love for the fatherland of which our 
people are the rightful custodians. 
  Dear comrades: 
  The National Frelimo Cadres Meeting will specifically center 
its discussions on the electoral manifesto, the government 
program after elections, and the party tasks in preparation for 
the coming elections. These are the principal components of our 
electoral strategy. Our proposals and recommendations will be 
channeled to the Special Session of the Frelimo Central 
Committee scheduled to take place after this meeting. The 
session will also center its discussions on the above issues. 
  Today there is a lot of talk about democratization, as if 
this was the most important issue for our people. It is true 
though that the consolidation of democracy constitutes a 
necessity in our present moment, our party's goal. 
  Democracy has no meaning, however, if people have no food; 
if 
everyone does not have access to health care and education; if 
everyone cannot enjoy freedom of movement throughout the 
national territory. 
  We always have to bear in mind what our people's priorities 
are. To better realize these priorities, we have to increasingly 
create better conditions for the participation of citizens and 
all social forces in decision-making at all levels of our 
country's life. 
  The example of democracy begins in our midst, with our 
militants, in our party organs. This meeting expresses the 
consolidation of the democratic exercise in our party. We have 
to constantly improve our working methods to reveal our 
individual and local initiatives, with a view to heightening the 
intervention of our party organs and militants in society. 
  The cohesion and unity among party members, sympathizers, 
and 
all citizens who support Frelimo's cause must be reinforced, 
particularly if we take into consideration the wave of violent 
and defamatory criticism leveled against us by some political 
forces. 
  We must always be present in society so that these 
defamations do not make the Mozambican people forget what the 
principal reason was for the present situation of misery 
experienced by most of our People. 
  The principal reason for this misery was the war of 
destabilization mounted from abroad, where Mozambicans were used 
to destroy their own country, villages, schools, and hospitals 
which were useful to their countrymen and their families; 
factories, farms, shops, roads, and bridges, which produced, 
traded, and helped to distribute products which we all need. 
  Mozambicans used to serve the interests of revengeful 
settlers, Rhodesian racists, and "apartheid" bosses, ended up 
becoming victims of this criminal process. 
  Now that they are part of the national political chess game, 
they need houses, schools, hospitals, shops, and factories which 
they themselves destroyed. Today they want voters and these 
voters are among those who lost their loved ones, among those 
who suffered the most inhuman physical mutilations carried out 
on orders of anti- Mozambican forces abroad. 
  The atmosphere of national reconciliation, peace, and the 
need to reunify the Mozambican family cannot make us indifferent 
to attempts to manipulate the awareness of our people and 
falsify history. The darkest pages have been registered in the 
life of our people in our country's history, but the most 
beautiful pages have also been registered. These beautiful 
pages of freedom, independence, fraternity, and national unity, 
peace and reconciliation of which we are so proud to champion, 
constitute our constant source of inspiration, the constant 
foundation of our convictions to face the great challenges of 
today and tomorrow. 
  Dear comrades: 
  On 25 June this year, Frelimo will celebrate 32 years of 
existence and Mozambique 19 as an independent country. 
  During all these years, we accumulated abundant political 
and 
technical experience. Our party has always had the capacity to 
adjust course following the country's reality in each historical 
moment, as well as the courage to identify inadequate policies 
and mistakes in order to find solutions. These are some of the 
reasons which make our party an esteemed organization. 
  We are proud to note that most of the participants of this 
meeting are cadres who were trained academically and/or 
professionally after national independence, as is the case with 
dozens of thousands of others found in every corner of this 
beautiful Mozambique. 
  It was these cadres, alongside all other militants and the 
people, who enabled Frelimo to draw up objectives and realize a 
vast plan of actions for the benefit of the people, despite the 
adverse conditions created by acts of aggression carried out by 
the racist regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa. 
  Between 1975 and 1977, the Frelimo government overcame the 
crisis in the operation of public administration, following a 
massive exodus of qualified technicians. 
  Until 1982 access to education increased. The number of 
primary school pupils doubled, while the number of secondary 
school students quadrupled. 
  More than 5,000 higher institute technicians have been 
formed 
since national independence. We reduced the rate of illiteracy 
by 20 percent. We established another 358 health posts and 
centers; while laboratory network quadrupled. 
  More than 400,000 people began to have clean water, 
particularly from wells; important projects were carried out 
through the dams of Pequenos Libombos, Corumana, Cuamba, and 
Lichinga; we realized our development strategy in 
telecommunications and rehabilitated railroads on the Nacala, 
Beira, Limpopo Corridors, as well as textile factories in the 
north of the country. 
  I have just cited a few examples of what was accomplished. A 
lot of what we built was destroyed by the enemies of Mozambique. 
Since our mission is to serve the people, however, even during 
the war, our party cadres have always carried out the best of 
their work for the country. 
  Today, with renewed hope and conviction, once again our 
cadres demonstrate their political maturity, their technical and 
professional abilities, and their immense love for the people. 
  On behalf of the Frelimo Central Committee, I would like to 
salute with great affection all our cadres, men and women, who 
throughout the country gave and continue to give great lessons 
of patriotism, self-denial, and commitment to our project to 
make Mozambicans a truly happy and prosperous people. 
  Cadres are pillars of the party. That is why we must 
continue to do the best we can so that together we can 
consolidate peace, justice, and democracy, promote our country's 
development and progress, so that each of us can develop and 
realize his or her talents as a citizen. 
  Dear comrades: 
  We have favorable conditions for obtaining victory in the 
coming general elections. 
  We have a people who continue to respect and admire Frelimo, 
because our party has always been known to embody their most 
noble ideals and aspirations. 
  Proof of this are the visits that I recently made to the 
Provinces of Gaza, Sofala, Tete, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado. 
  The affection accorded to the president of the Republic and 
other government officials demonstrate the deep esteem for 
Frelimo. We need to respect and guarantee the development of 
this attitude. 
  We have a party which has more than 900,000 members. We have 
the best cadres in the country. We have youth and women on our 
side. What we need is just to work hard, with great tenacity, 
since no victory is obtained without efforts and sacrifice. 
  I repeat: Victory has to be prepared, victory has to be 
organized. Let us therefore devote ourselves, with all our 
knowledge and energy to work after we have prepared and 
organized ourselves here for victory. 
  Comrades: 
  As from 1 June, the voter registration process will begin 
throughout the country. This is an important pointer for us to 
view with optimism the peace process in Mozambique. 
  This is an important step forward so that in October this 
year Mozambicans aged 18 and over can exercise their right and 
civic duty to vote in the first multiparty elections the 
president of the Republic and deputies of the Assembly, those 
whom they feel are the best representatives of their 
aspirations, those whom they feel have the ability and 
experience to remove our country from the present state of 
poverty and decisively move toward economic and social 
development. 
  What we want today is what we have always wanted, but the 
mentors of war against Mozambique never allowed us to realize 
this. 
  We want happiness, prosperity, and progress, in brief, 
wellbeing for all our people. 
  It is true that we have been experiencing some delays in the 
implementation of the General Peace Accord. 
  These delays do not, however, jeopardize the implementation 
of all phases of the process as provided for in the accord. The 
Mozambican Government will continue to carry out all efforts to 
guarantee that the multiparty elections take place on 27 and 28 
October this year. 
  There are other positive aspects that need mentioning. 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] officials, particularly 
its leader Afonso Dhlakama, have repeatedly reiterated before 
the national and international communities their commitment to 
never again resume war, even in case of defeat in the coming 
elections. 
  Renamo has been presenting lists of areas under its control 
to be integrated into state administration. This process, 
however, must on one hand be carried out speedily, so that these 
areas can be opened to all political parties and allow 
businessmen to carry out their activities there. 
  On the other hand, the process must be carried out with all 
seriousness, common sense, and good faith, to avoid pretexts 
that could lead to new delays in the implementation of the 
General Peace Accord. 
  We are still concerned about the lack of freedom of movement 
of citizens in areas under Renamo control; the movement of armed 
elements belonging to this organization; and the policy of 
violence and torture against citizens who do not obey their 
orders or who simply do not show sympathy toward Renamo. 
  The beating of local officials in Xai-Xai, on the Renamo 
leader's orders, are a serious human rights violation and a 
gross violation of the law and the General Peace Accord itself. 
This issue does not stop being a political issue, even if this 
is a criminal offense which must be examined and resolved in 
accordance with the law in force. 
  In other words, there are still Renamo elements who have not 
abandoned the tendency to commit crime, which has always 
characterized them during various years of the war. 
  This is neither the first nor the most serious violation of 
human rights and breach of the law by Renamo. Frelimo and the 
government have been exposing such actions carried out by Renamo 
men. 
  The national and international communities, as well as the 
UN 
Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz], must not minimize these 
incidents. 
  We would like to call on the Renamo leadership to behave in 
a 
civilized manner in the political game and order its men to 
strictly adhere to the General Peace Accord, as well as to 
respect the law and the legally installed authorities. 
  Dear comrades: 
  The present political atmosphere being experienced in 
southern Africa encourages us to view our future with promise. 
  In South Africa, the African National Congress' victory, and 
the election of our friend and comrade, Nelson Mandela, as the 
first South African President chosen by the people marks the end 
of "apartheid" and the birth of a new South Africa where 
citizens of all races and ethnical groups are equal before the 
law; where repression and oppression ceased to be the policy of 
the state; a new South Africa which replaces the policy of 
destabilization of neighboring countries, including Mozambique; 
a South Africa which stands for cooperation and good 
neighborliness. In South Africa, the people have chosen the 
party that has always defended them from massacres and acts of 
aggression, the people chose the party that better embodied 
their interests and aspirations. 
  The end of "apartheid" in South Africa and the establishment 
of a democratic government represents a great victory for all of 
mankind, particularly for the peoples of southern Africa. 
  The peoples of our region were targets of the policy of 
destabilization of the "apartheid" regime. Mozambicans today 
still bear the scars of the policy of aggression of the racist 
regime. 
  Now that South Africa has reemerged with a new political 
stance in the region, this reinforces our hope for a better 
future for the region and Mozambique in particular. 
  We all anxiously await South Africa's admittance as the 11th 
member of the Southern African Development Community. 
  In Malawi, a new President, Bakili Muluzi, was 
democratically 
elected, ending a regime that had ceased to have the support of 
the people long ago. 
  Armed men who took part in massacring Mozambican populations 
and destroying economic and social infrastructures transited 
through or from Malawi. 
  We give major importance to the visit that President Bakili 
Muluzi has just made to Mozambique. 
  This is the first time that a head of state or the 
Government 
of Malawi made an official visit to our independent country. 
Mozambique is also the first country that the Malawian head of 
state visited. These facts reflect the new political situation 
in that country. 
  All conditions have now been created so that relations of 
friendship and cooperation between Mozambique and Malawi can 
reach the high levels that we have always desired. 
  Beginning now, our relations with Malawi are based on mutual 
respect, on noninterference in the internal affairs of each 
country and on a mutually advantageous cooperation. 
  We continue to view with optimism the conclusion of the 
present peace talks between the Angolan Government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
  Although there is still concern about eventual impasses 
which 
could be artificially introduced in the process by the mentors 
of war in Angola, the news that the parties are moving toward a 
negotiated solution of the conflict is a positive step forward. 
  We would like to encourage the government led by the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola to continue with efforts 
aimed at establishing peace in Angola, and we would like to urge 
UNITA to finally respond with seriousness to the appeals of the 
Angolan people and the entire world to silence arms in that 
fraternal country. 
  We would like to reiterate our solidarity with the Angolan 
people, and it is our hope that they will finally have peace and 
tranquility and thus contribute to their national development. 
  Dear comrades: 
  As we begin the National Frelimo Cadres Meeting, we would 
like once again to stress that we came here to hear your views, 
welcome your views and opinions, in order to build the solid 
foundations of our victory in elections. 
  Let us improve our image with better political and 
professional engagement, as well as by assuming a public and 
moral posture which corresponds with our principles and our 
people's desire. 
  We expect the best participation from all of you. 
  Let us move toward victory, toward a better future.

  [Text] Dr. Brazao Mazula, chairman of the National 
Electoral Council [CNE], has acknowledged [words indistinct] 
that logistical and transportation problems are hindering the 
smooth registration of voters. Mazula said that as a result of 
the CNE appeal, the government, and the UN Operations in 
Mozambique have already provided vehicles, light aircraft, and 
helicopters which are scheduled to arrive in various provinces 
this week. Mazula was speaking after he registered at Maputo's 
1 May Industrial School for the October elections.

  [Text] The National Democratic Party, Panade, has accused 
the Manica Province government of allowing foreigners to 
register for the elections and then vote for the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo]. Cardoso Saide, Panade's deputy 
national coordinator, says foreigners are being brought from 
neighboring countries for registration in Mossurize, Manica, and 
Barue Districts. In a communique sent to our Chimoio 
correspondent, Saide said before the registration began, 
Mossurize District had about 31,000 inhabitants, but now the 
figure has risen to 98,000, most of them having come from 
Zimbabwe. Panade urged all unarmed political parties, UN 
Operations in Mozambique observers, and monitoring and 
registration teams to be vigilant and report cases of that 
nature, as these are likely to create serious problems during 
the October elections. Saide said this is yet another delaying 
tactic by the Frelimo government to prevent the upcoming 
multiparty general elections from being free and fair. It has 
not been possible to get comment from acting Manica Provincial 
Governor Carlos Falcao and Henrique Munguambe, chairman of the 
provincial National Elections Commission.

<F P=106> [Article by Christo Retief] </F>
  [Excerpts] A high-level investigation in United Democratic 
Front [UDF] ranks has been launched after confidential and 
sensitive information was apparently "leaked" to local 
newspapers on the UDF's role in attempts to establish a new 
political group comprising smaller opposition parties. UDF 
President Mr. Justus Garoeb yesterday confirmed to DIE 
REPUBLIKEIN that he is personally in charge of the investigation 
and that "there will be trouble" if a UDF member turns out to be 
the source of the information. In a news release Mr. Garoeb 
also confirmed the UDF's involvement, as stated in the release, 
in the preliminary negotiations with opposition parties in the 
National Assembly concerning the formation of a new political 
coalition and the reaching of election agreements. 
  He stated that the formation of a coalition and cooperation 
agreements is a normal occurrence in a democratic system and 
declared that the latest negotiations between opposition parties 
is nothing strange or exceptional. "We are, however, deeply 
concerned about the deliberate and untimely leakage of official 
documents to the press at this sensitive stage of negotiations 
on coalition. These actions are highly irresponsible." [passage 
omitted] 
  He did not want to comment further on the establishment of 
the planned coalition since he did not have a mandate to release 
information to the media. According to him the launching 
committee on coalition, under the leadership of Mr. Che 
Ngaringombe, was responsible for ironing out "hitches" between 
participating parties and will report to the leaders of the 
various parties "as soon as possible". 
  Some of the parties, such as the UDF, will discuss the issue 
with their respective Central Committees before any decision is 
taken on the planned coalition. According to him the "hitches" 
include, among other things, the usual administrative details 
between the various parties such as the proposed name and motto 
of such a coalition. Mr. Garoeb also did not want to comment on 
a list noting names and portfolios of the proposed coalition, 
which was released to DIE REPUBLIKEIN by sources in the 
launching committee. 
  According to the document the coalition will be known as the 
Democratic Coalition of Parties with Mr. Garoeb as president, 
Mr. Moses Katjiuongua, of the NPF [National Patriotic Front], 
and Mr. Hans Diergaardt of the Rehoboth Free [Democratic Party], 
as vice presidents; Mr. Gerson Veii of SWANU [South-West Africa 
National Union], chairman, and Mr. Kephes Conradie of the FCN 
[Federal Convention for Namibia], secretary general. The 
members of the politburo are: Mr. Peter Kayser of the German 
Action, Mr. Allen Liebenberg, a Mrs. du Plessis, Mr. Oiva 
Angula, Mr. Hans Peters, Mr. Eric Biwa, and Mr. Gabriel Sisehe, 
all of the UDF.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Justice Minister Dullah Omar on the </F>
SAPA PR Wire Service on 7 June] 
  [Text] 1. On 27 May 1994 an indication was given to 
Parliament of thinking within government on the need to set up a 
commission of truth and reconciliation to enable South Africa to 
come to terms with its past. 
  I reiterate that reconciliation is not simply a question of 
indemnity/amnesty and letting bygones be bygones. If the wounds 
of the past are to be healed, if a multiplicity of legal actions 
are to be avoided, if future human rights violations are to be 
avoided - and indeed -- if we are to successfully initiate the 
building of a human rights culture -- disclosure of the truth 
and its acknowledgement are essential. 
  We cannot forgive on behalf of victims -- nor do we have the 
moral right to do so. It is the victims themselves who must 
speak. Their voices need to be heard. 
  The fundamental issue for all South Africans is therefore to 
come to terms with our past on the only moral basis possible 
namely that the truth be told and that the truth be acknowledged. 
  International human rights norms and standards and other 
international experiences provide us with guidance. 
  2. In finalizing our proposals we are considering the 
following 
  matters: 
  (i) Composition of the commission the commission should 
consist of eminent respected South Africans and must be broadly 
representative. 
  (ii) The terms of reference of the commission would include 
investigating and establishing the truth about human rights 
violations and their acknowledgement. Gross violations of human 
rights must be fully and officially investigated with due regard 
to fair procedures. The identity of the victims and what 
happened to them, and the identity perpetrators must be made 
known. There must, as indicated, be both knowledge and 
acknowledgement. The events need to be officially recognized and 
publicly revealed. Truth telling responds to the demand for 
justice for the victims and facilitates national reconciliation. 
  (iii) Fair procedures: The commission should perform its 
task 
and responsibilities on the basis of fair procedures and the 
adherence to international law relating to human rights must be 
assured. 
  (iv) Reparation/compensation: This is another difficult 
matter. However, a framework needs to be created to deal with 
all claims -- especially those based on gross violations of 
human rights with the power to bring finality to such matters -- 
it being borne in mind that it is the democratic government that 
will have to bear the financial burden. 
  (v) Time frame: The commission is to complete its work 
within 
a prescribed period of time for example 18 months or two years. 
  (vi) Reporting to the nation: There should be reports 
submitted to the president from time to time as well as a final 
and complete report after which the president shall report to 
the nation and thereby close this chapter on South Africa's past. 
  3. Amnesty/indemnity 
  It is in the above context that legislation should make 
provision for amnesty/indemnity. 
  (i) The commission may set up a specialized structure to 
deal 
with all applications and make recommendations. 
  (ii) The cut-off date in respect of offences committed will 
be no later than 5 December 1993. 
  (iii) The offences in respect of which amnesty may be 
applied 
for will be defined strictly within the framework of the 
constitutional provision on national unity and reconciliation. 
  (iv) The recommendations of the commission shall be referred 
to the president whose decision will be final. 
  (v) There will be a fixed cut-off date for applications. All 
persons seeking amnesty/indemnity will be required to submit 
applications by not later than such date. 
  4. Participation 
  Participation in the process will help the nation to heal 
itself. Whilst the above represents the thinking within 
government, individuals, organizations, religious bodies and 
members of the public generally are invited to submit their 
comments and proposals by 30 June 1994 to the Ministry of 
Justice before legislation is finalized. Such comments, 
suggestions and proposals will receive consideration in the 
finalization of legislative proposals which will then be placed 
before the cabinet. 
  5. Outstanding applications 
  Whilst we are in the process of preparing legislation along 
the lines set out above, there exists great concern about the 
various applications for indemnity submitted under the existing 
indemnity laws to the previous government. Such applicants have 
an expectation that their applications will be processed and 
finalized in terms of the existing indemnity laws. 
  I agree that these applications cannot await consideration 
until a new law is passed. Hence consideration of all such 
applications under the existing indemnity laws will be 
expedited. An advisory committee under the convenorship of Mr 
Brian Currin, national director of Lawyers for Human Rights will 
be set up immediately. Its task will be to scrutinize all such 
outstanding indemnity/amnesty applications which are still 
pending and to make appropriate recommendations to the state 
president. Those who qualify in terms of the two indemnity laws 
will be released immediately. Those who do not qualify will, 
together with the new applicants be given an opportunity to 
apply for amnesty through the new mechanisms which are being 
established in terms of the constitution. 
  Issued by the Ministry of Justice 
  Cape Town 7 June 1994

<F P=106> [Interview with Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom by </F>
announcer Freek Robinson; place not given; on the "Agenda" 
program; italicized passages in Afrikaans--live] 
  [Text] [Robinson] As I understand it, as it has been 
reported, you are basically at loggerheads with your own deputy 
minister on this particular case, but the principle underlying 
is market value for farms. What is the position? 
  [Hanekom] No, it's not really true that I have been at 
loggerheads with our deputy minister. There is a clear 
provision in the constitution for compensation, and we would of 
course adhere to the constitutional provisions, but it requires 
a lot more thought. The constitutional provisions say that there 
will be just compensation, fair and equitable, in fact. What it 
means, and what it also says is that various factors will be 
taken into account -- the historical terms of acquisition. So 
what we are saying is that if in the event of farmers having 
obtained the land under favorable conditions, in fact conditions 
of less than market value, then we could certainly not justify a 
case of farmers profiteering out of forced removals, in other 
words getting market value in compensation when they paid less 
than market value originally. If that is the case.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] But at the same time they, having 
lived on the farm for a number of years they had made some 
improvements, and that certainly must also be taken into account. 
  [Hanekom] Absolutely. I don't see any difference between 
myself and Mr. Meyer, unless he has made certain public 
statements which I'm not aware of. In my discussions with him, 
we recognized that where improvements have been made on the land 
full compensation would only be fair if people had erected 
fences and built dams, and put up structures. They would have 
to get paid at full market value for those improvements on the 
land. 
  [Robinson] Let's just get down to basics now. As I 
understand it, the date stipulated in the constitution is the 
19th of June 1913 -- no claims can be made further back than 
that, and as from now, whenever this new process starts, and 
that must be some time in August I believe, when this law comes 
into effect through Parliament, the new Parliament, then within 
three years the claims must be put to the new commission. So 
when is that new commission going to start operating? 
  [Hanekom] Well, as soon as possible. We would see that as 
being one of our priority policy moves, if you like. We have to 
pass the necessary legislation in order to set up the land 
claims court. We would like to see absolutely minimum delay in 
getting the land claims court fully functional. The minimum 
delay probably means not before October this year. It's an act 
required to be passed by Parliament, and then a certain minimum 
time delay to set up the necessary structures which means the 
court on the one hand, and commissions based on all of the 
provinces on the other hand. 
  [Robinson] And that can take until the end of this year to 
get that all practically implemented? 
  [Hanekom] Realistically, it could well take until the end of 
the year. In the mean time, the present government appointed 
with its tasks, albeit of a very limited nature. 
  [Robinson] But that has no real standing in law because all 
of those things must go through the to-be-appointed commission, 
and then going to the land claims court. 
  [Hanekom] Correct. But in the meantime the commission on 
land allocations is a legitimate body. It has limited terms of 
reference, it has to deal with those cases in front of it as 
effectively as possible, and then as soon as possible we get the 
land claims court operational with the accompanying new 
commission. 
  [Robinson] Obviously, the immediate thought is that most of 
those people who will go to the commission and to the land 
claims court will be black people, people who have been driven 
off their land. But at the same time white farmers have also 
been forced, so to speak, from their land because the state 
needed their land to consolidate it into homelands. Will they 
on the same basis equally be able to go to the land claims court? 
  [Hanekom] Your first mistake, Freek, is that the state did 
not need their land to consolidate homelands. They should never 
have embarked on a homeland consolidation program in the first 
place. But never mind... 
  [Robinson] That's not my mistake, of course. That policy was 
in place as you know. 
  [Hanekom] If they wanted to implement such policies then in 
theory they needed that land, yes, correct. But be it as it 
may, white farmers were expropriated, and certain white farmers 
may indeed go to the land claims court to go back to the land 
from which they were also forcibly removed in a sense. 
Circumstances were different. They were different in a sense 
that white farmers were compensated at full market value, and of 
course had the opportunity to buy land of equal value elsewhere 
in the country. Black people were paid far less than market 
value, if they got any compensation at all, and had very little 
opportunities to resettle themselves elsewhere. 
  [Robinson] How many claims have you received so far? All in 
all? 
  [Hanekom] We haven't received any claims insofar as the 
claims are still going to the commission on land allocations. 
They received something in the order of 1,300 claims. Many of 
them would be claims that would not fall under the jurisdiction 
of the land claims court we are talking about. We have in our 
department approximately 90 rural claims which would certainly 
fall within the definitions of the land claims court, within the 
constitutional provisions of the land claims court. 
  [Robinson] Now I would like to continue with this 
discussion, and later we will come to the practical side of how 
to help people who are on the land. But can we just try to 
clarify a few things? If you have so many claims, it's doubtful 
that you will be able to process all of those claims within 
three years. As I understand it, those complaints must be 
lodged within three years, but actually getting to the practical 
implementation of settling their claims will take a lot longer. 
  [Hanekom] Yes, firstly we would like those historical claims 
not to drag on forever. It is an ugly part of our history, and 
a shameful part of our history which we want to deal with as 
quickly as possible, and as fairly as possible. So we are 
saying that we can't go on forever. People can't rediscover 
claims forever and forever, therefore, we say there should be a 
three-year period during which people can lodge their claims. 
Clearly there will be a delay. We are hoping that the whole 
process will be completed within a five-year period. 
  [Robinson] And how much will it cost? 
  [Hanekom] It is quite difficult to say because it is not 
like 
housing where you can say we are going to build x-number of 
houses over the next five years. Because we don't at this point 
know exactly how many claims will come forward, but we're 
looking at a possible cost of the entire land reform program of 
something in the order of two and a half billion per year, 
something of that nature, which would include the broader 
redistribution program as well as the restitution program. 
  [Robinson] There's a perception that you will institute a 
special land tax to pay for it. 
  [Hanekom] It certainly is a matter under consideration, not 
alone tax to pay for the restitution program, but a land tax as 
part of a land reform program. A land tax is not really 
intended for central government revenue at all. The cost of the 
restitution program has to be paid for out of government coffers 
in the same way that housing is paid for out of central 
government coffers, and education, and health services and so 
forth. So we don't see the land tax as a source of revenue to 
cover a land reform program, but it could have other desirable 
effects in the interests of land reform. [passage omitted] 
  [Robinson] Let us just talk about the criteria of 
people who have to return to their land. Are there any criteria 
-- just the fact that they lived there before, or do you also 
look at whether they will be able to use that land 
productively? 
  [Hanekom] Freek, may I just say something before I 
return to your question. It was indeed an inspiration for me to 
see just now what happened in Riemvasmaak. I was there 
personally. It was the most fantastic experience of my life, 
and I must say it in Afrikaans, because although I am mainly 
English speaking, I was there and we spoke Afrikaans to each 
other, and it was just fantastic. It was also the first 
real public event in my new responsibility in my 
office, and it has been such an inspiration. I must say it 
tells us what it's all about. It is about justice, about 
creating opportunities, and so on. Now to come back to your 
question. 
  Yes, in the first place there are many people who have 
the right to return to their own land, and for that provision 
has been made in court, irrespective of how they want to use 
that land, or whatever their plans are. Of course, we very much 
want them to use that land well, and they must get the necessary 
support for that, but that is their own land, and they have the 
right to return to their land. There are of course many other 
cases where there is a need for land. There too state 
assistance is needed. But those are different cases, they will 
not go through the courts. 
  [Robinson] But if these people end up on their land 
then that land should at least be used productively. To what 
extent will you help the people to do that? 
  [Hanekom] In the first place, it is the 
responsibility of the state, because the people were forcibly 
removed from their land, and in many respects people lost 
their skills, and are not in an immediate position to make full 
use of the land which they have now got back, and we must take 
into account those factors. People, white farmers enjoyed a lot 
of support. We are not saying that we want to go through the 
same subsidy systems and get people indebted on the land, but we 
are saying that white farmers enjoyed a certain amount of 
support which got them going. And we are saying that these 
people who are going back to their land, they do have skills, 
they have energy, they would like to work their land, but they 
will be in a much better position to do so if they are given 
some support by the state. 
  However we don't believe it's state responsibility alone, 
and 
that was the nice thing about your footage. Where we have 
situations where the farmers assist, where local or adjacent 
farmers assist the people returning to their land, that is 
really a win-win situation. That's the most desirable 
situation, because those farmers next door to the land, they 
know the conditions better than anyone else and they are right 
there to give support. So we really do like to see situations 
of full cooperation between those going back to their land and 
the farmers who are there. 
  [Robinson] But I imagine there must be some kind of formal 
structure to give training to those people, apart from the 
training that they can get from farmers next door? And whose 
responsibility is that? Is it yours, or with the minister of 
agriculture, or the minister of provincial affairs, or who? 
  [Hanekom] There is a whole package of support which would 
have to go along with the return to land. On the one hand it is 
agricultural training to help people to make better decisions -- 
in other words, good extension work which would be provided by 
the Department of Agriculture. But there is a whole planning 
process which goes into the return of land. People have to make 
decisions -- where are we going to build our houses, how are we 
going to get water? Water affairs would most certainly be 
involved, because we have to see it in the context of the whole 
Reconstruction and Development Program. It is one component of 
a much bigger program of rural development and the improvement 
of people's quality of lives. 
  [Robinson] Who will coordinate that process? Mr. Jay Naidoo 
or you, will have a lot of work to do, that's for sure! 
  [Hanekom] No, no, Mr. J. Naidoo would give us as much 
support 
as possible, and would certainly see himself as assisting when 
it comes to coordinated activities between the relevant 
departments. For example, housing, water affairs, and the parks 
board could be involved in certain cases.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] But the principle.... 
  [Hanekom, continuing] The main responsibility would lie in 
my 
department. We are responsible for land reform and ensuring 
that people who go back to their land are given the necessary 
support that they can take full advantage of the new 
opportunities opening up for them. 
  [Robinson] And just one last one -- the matter of communal 
farming. Is that something that you will leave up to the people 
to decide for themselves, or will you encourage them to be 
individual productive farmers? 
  [Hanekom] In certain cases people would choose to be 
individual productive farmers, in other cases people will farm 
under the traditional system, and they do it well. They 
understand the system, and if that is what they choose, we would 
certainly not wish to impose anything else on people. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Hanekom, thank you very much for your 
participation here tonight, and I'm sure we will hear more in 
the future on this very sensitive matter, but anyway we now have 
a few guidelines. Thank you very much. 
  [Hanekom] Thank you very much, Freek.

  [Text] Pretoria June 6 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela has 
enacted a public service act, paving the way for a new civil 
service to replace that of the former central, homeland and 
self-governing territories' governments. 
  Minister of Public Service and Administration Zola Skweyiya 
said on Monday [6 June] the act would replace the Public Service 
Employment Acts of all previous government entities. 
  "It makes provision for 32 national departments and 
organisational components and nine provincial administrations. 
It will now be possible to rationalise the administrative 
structures of the former public services into these new 
structures. It also paves the way for the establishment of 
uniform terms and conditions of employment for all public 
servants. This has been a bone of contention in a number of 
regions. I wish to emphasise that more work needs to be done 
before the implementation of uniformity in the terms and 
conditions of employment can be finalised. This process will, 
however, be expedited," Dr Skweyiya said in a statement. 
  He said the act was an important step in the rationalisation 
of the public service. "Various government institutions are in 
the process of urgently finalising their planning with the view 
to implementing further rationalisation actions. Obviously all 
relevant role players will be consulted in this process. 
  "I sincerely regard the public service as one of the most 
important elements of the state. The government cannot develop 
the country and build the nation without an efficient public 
service and for this reason the government is committed to 
establish the best possible public service for South Africa and 
one which will be accepted by the community at large," Dr 
Skweyiya said.

  [Text] Pretoria June 6 SAPA -- State armaments procurement 
agency Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] was 
trying to shed its "cloak and dagger" image as it prepared for a 
more visible international role, Arsmcor Chairman Johan Moolman 
said on Monday [6 June]. He was speaking at the handing over of 
Armscor's 1993/94 annual report to Defence Minister Joe Modise 
at Armscor's Pretoria head office. 
  "We want to overcome the perception that Armscor and the 
industry in South Africa is a cloak and dagger business and that 
there is a crook behind every propeller. That is not true. The 
fact that we had to get products into the country through 
so-called channels we will admit," Mr Moolman said in a 
reference to South Africa's illicit purchase of armaments and 
weapons technology during three decades of a United Nations arms 
embargo on South Africa. He said South Africa had always tried 
to be an honest arms dealer. 
  Mr Moolman said he welcomed debate on the countries to which 
Arsmcor sold weapons, saying this was a cabinet decision. He 
would welcome the issue being discussed in a parliamentary 
standing committee. 
  The report notes a decrease in the defence budget over the 
past few years. "Consequently the South African National 
Defence Force had less funds available for the acquisition of 
equipment," the report says. 
  "Arsmcor and the defence industry are national asset that 
will play an important role in the development of South Africa. 
In close collaboration with the local defence industry, Arsmcor 
will continue to ensure that South Africa remains 
self-sufficient in key military and security systems." 
  Arsmcor spent R4,481 million [rand] in 1993/94 on arms and 
equipment. Of this sum, R2,487 million was spent on aerospace 
equipment, including the replacement of the aged Harvard 
aircraft with the Pilatus PC-7 aircraft. Delivery of the first 
aircraft is expected in October this year. 
  Money was also spent on upgrading existing aircraft. The 
Rooivalk combat helicopter was developed. 
  Vehicle and weapons systems absorbed R1,014 million. Among 
the projects were developing tank technology, producing armoured 
vehicles for the South African army and for the South African 
Police Services. 
  The remainder of the acquisitions budget was spent on 
electronics and maritime products. A tactical radio system was 
developed, communications infrastructure for the Bushveld 
Airspace Control Centre was developed as well as underwater 
telephones for use on surface ships and submarines. 
  The Arsmcor report also highlights steps taken to harness 
military technology for civilian use.

  [Text] The Human Rights Committee of South Africa says 
thedeath toll from violence in South Africa has dropped by 60 
percent from 487 in April to 195 last month. The committee says 
in a report that the decrease gives a clear signal that the 
peace, which prevailed during the election days, has been 
maintained. It says that despite ongoing tensions in 
KwaZulu-Natal, violence has continued to drop in this region, 
with the death toll last month being the lowest recorded by the 
committee since January 1993.

  [Text] King William's Town June 6 SAPA -- The Border region 
of the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] has decided to launch a 
recruitment drive in predominantly white areas and to 
discontinue the use of the slogan "One settler, one bullet". 
  A resolution to this effect was adopted at a regional 
meeting 
at King William's Town at the weekend. The meeting was attended 
by the PAC's sole representative in the Eastern Cape 
legislature, Mr T T Letlaka. 
  PAC regional secretary Mr Mvuyo Mhangwane said the 
organisation would work with other community organisations to 
eliminate no-go areas in the province and to strive to make it 
"peaceful enough" to attract investors. 
  Mr Mhangwane said the meeting also endorsed the integration 
of Azanian Peoples Liberation Army members into the South 
African National Defence Force. 
  Structures to prepare for the local government elections 
would be set up, he said.

  [Text] Pietermaritzburg June 4 SAPA -- Newly-elected 
National Party [NP] KwaZulu/Natal provincial leader Danie 
Schutte paid tribute to his predecessor George Bartlett at an NP 
special congress in Pietermaritzburg on Saturday [4 June]. 
  Former Home Affairs Minister Mr Schutte replaced Mr 
Bartlett, 
who has been appointed provincial MEC [member of executive 
committee] for agriculture. The congress was called to formally 
adopt the NP's new federal constitution and elect new office 
bearers. 
  Mr Bartlett had led the NP in Natal through four-and-a-half 
difficult years, Mr Schutte said. "In those years he 
consolidated support in this province for the reform process; 
confirmed the principles of federalism, also to the benefit of 
this province; and played a major role in ensuring there was an 
inclusive settlement and a peaceful transition and election 
process." 
  Mr Bartlett had also played a major role in fostering good 
relations and stability in the province, he said. 
  The NP's greatest feat was the implementation of a new 
constitutional dispensation, but this was only the beginning of 
its mission. The party now had to make the new constitution 
work in the interests of all the people, and to ensure minority 
and group rights were respected. 
  In KwaZulu/Natal, the NP had to ensure the provincial 
constitution was fair to all population groups and would ensure 
growth, stability and prosperity. "It is sad that it appears 
the spirit of a government of national unity has not yet 
permeated KwaZulu/Natal. Everything has taken so long to happen 
here," Mr Schutte said.

of swearing in UNITA members of Parliament. Our Lusaka 
correspondent Alves Antonio has the details: 
  The UNITA negotiators claim they are still considering the 
issue that was placed on the negotiating table on 3 June. This 
afternoon the two negotiating teams were at the Mulungushi 
Conference Center to once again try to find a way out to that 
issue, but to no avail. Meanwhile, efforts continue to be made 
to overcome the obstacles so that other aspects relating to 
national reconciliation can be addressed. It was not a 
productive day, but the delegations are still eager to negotiate.

  [Text] Cape Town June 7 SAPA -- Mr Arthur Chaskalson has 
been appointed president of the Constitutional Court. This was 
announced on Tuesday [7 June] by the minister of justice, Mr 
Dullah Omar. 
  Mr Chaskalson, an honorary professor of law at Witwatersrand 
University since 1981, was a member of the Technical Committee 
on Constitutional Issues appointed in may last year to advise 
the multi-party negotiation forum which drafted South Africa's 
interim constitution. 
  Born in Johannesburg on November 24 1931, he is also a 
former 
long-standing member of the National Council of Lawyers for 
Human Rights and has been a consultant to the African National 
Congress on constitutional issues since April 1990. 
  Mr Omar told a news conference in Cape Town that Mr 
Chaskalson was one of South Africa's most distinguished 
advocates and enjoyed international recognition and standing as 
a jurist. 
  Mr Omar also announced the composition of the Judicial 
Service Commission which is to recommend six of the 
Constitutional Court's 10 judges. 
  It is: Chief Justice Michael Corbett; Mr Chaskalson; the 
senior judge president, Mr Justice J A Howard; Mr Omar himself; 
Professor Etienne Mureinik; Senators I W Direko, E S Mchunu, B T 
Nqcuka and Ray Radue; Adv David Gordon, SC [senior counsel]; Adv 
George Bizos SC; Adv Kgomotso Moroka; and Mr J Ernstzen, a trade 
unionist. 
  Mr Omar said the further names of two practising advocates 
and two practising attorneys would be announced once different 
positions adopted by the Association of Law Societies and the 
General Council of the Bar, on the one hand, and the National 
Association of Democratic Lawyers, on the other, had been 
resolved. 
  He hoped this would occur "so as to enable the chief justice 
to proceed with the convening of the first meeting of the 
Judicial Service Commission". 
  Mr Omar pointed out that in terms of Section 99 of the 
interim constitution, four Supreme Court judges are to be 
appointed to the Constitutional Court by President Nelson 
Mandela in consultation with the cabinet and with the chief 
justice. 
  In addition to recommending judges and related judicial 
matters, the Judicial Service Commission would also play an 
important role in the rationalisation process flowing from South 
Africa being divided into nine provinces.

  [Text] In the past few months, the Chadian Government has 
initiated peace talks with political and military movements 
based in the Lake Chad and southern Chad region. One such 
movement is the Movement for Democracy and Development [MDD], 
and Moussa Medella, one of its officials, talked to our 
correspondent Malam Yaro in Niamey about the progress made in 
the negotiations with the government. 
  [Begin recording] [Medella] Yes, we have been contacted 
several times by Ndjamena through the official channels but 
Ndjamena wants to hold separate negotiations whereas the MDD 
wants general negotiations involving all the sons of this 
country. Since Chad experienced a civil war some time ago, we 
really want a general solution for all Chadians. 
  [Yaro] Another question, Sir: Does the MDD plan to 
participate in the upcoming elections in Chad? 
  [Medella] Well, we are far from resolving the election 
problem because none of the conditions have been met. The 
negotiations have not been completed, there is no national Army 
in the country, and about 60 to 70 percent of Chadians live 
outside because of the insecurity in the country. The 
conditions have therefore not been met. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with RPF Chairman Alex Kanyerengwe by Colette </F>
Braeckman in Byumba; date not given] 
  [Text] [Braeckman] When the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) 
launched its offensive in October 1990, could you foresee that 
your struggle would lead to today's massacres? 
  [Kanyerengwe] Yes and no. We knew that there were already 
plans in each MRND [National Republican Movement for Democracy 
and Development] cell, but we could not predict the scope or the 
wickedness of the current events, with massacres that have 
decapitated all the active classes in the country, both Tutsis 
and Hutus. We feel that civilian society has practically been 
swept aside and that an entire generation of active, dynamic 
people, intellectuals, professionals, and merchants has been 
wiped off the face of the earth. These were the people who 
jeopardized the Habyarimana regime, so they were liquidated. 
  [Braeckman] According to you, where are the brains behind 
what has happened? 
  [Kanyerengwe] Apparently all the MRND's structures are 
involved, from the highest level to the local authorities who 
often led the groups of killers. As time went by, the group 
which formed around President Habyarimana solidified, with 
ramifications for the entire country. This group is responsible 
for the current situation. 
  [Braeckman] If you win a military victory, with whom will 
you 
govern this decimated country and how will you deal with the 
MRND? 
  [Kanyerengwe] We consider that the MRND as a party and 
institution, is no longer part of the political scene and 
completely disqualified. However, it is still possible to hold 
talks with individuals. We desperately hope that an 
international investigation will help us to shed light on that 
party's responsibility at all levels. Moreover, we must revive 
the dialogue with the survivors from the other parties and the 
survivors of civil society. 
  [Braeckman] You signed the Arusha agreements which enshrine 
the principle of power sharing. Are these agreements still 
valid? 
  [Kanyerengwe] Their spirit is valid, in any case, even if 
adjustments will have to be made as far as the MRND is 
concerned. We want to form a provisional government of national 
union with all the survivors of the other parties that signed 
the agreements. 
  Halting the Massacres Is a Precondition for any Cease-fire 
[subhead] 
  [Braeckman] Do you wish to move rapidly toward elections? 
  [Kanyerengwe] Elections? How can we talk about that today in 
view of the situation in the country, and the thousands of 
refugees, displaced persons, and people who have disappeared? 
The very first thing we have to do is reestablish a minimum 
level of security for the population. After that, of course, we 
will see. The war must stop; that is the first thing. 
  [Braeckman] So why has a cease-fire not yet been concluded? 
  [Kanyerengwe] We feel that the precondition for any 
cease-fire is that the massacres be stopped. All the people 
being held hostage must be evacuated so that they can go where 
they like. A cease-fire means that each side stops its troops 
where they are and that hostilities cease. 
  [Braeckman] So you are not seeking to win total military 
victory? 
  [Kanyerengwe] Of course not. We do not want either military 
victory or the surrender of the Army. We want a political 
solution. However, if a political solution is not forthcoming, 
then the RPF will continue its struggle. 
  [Braeckman] With whom will you agree to talk? 
  [Kanyerengwe] With the government Army, in the first place. 
Of course the Army has its share of responsibility for 
unleashing and continuing the massacres, but it is still a 
national and legal institution. On the other hand, there is no 
question at all of initiating talks with the current interim 
government, which has no legitimacy at all. This government was 
put together by resurrecting legislation which had already been 
abolished by the Arusha agreements. The text of these 
agreements is valid as basic law. Furthermore, we hold the 
members of this government directly responsible for the 
massacres. In Butare, in particular, they called for murder. 
In both Butare and Kibongo, the prefects who had managed to 
prevent the massacres were kicked out and then killed. The 
massacres started afterward. The only way we will meet with 
this government is with an arrest warrant. 
  [Braeckman] Many refugees fear RPF reprisals. 
  [Kanyerengwe] The current drama is that all or almost all 
Rwandan citizens have been implicated in the massacres. The 
massacres were planned at the highest level but they had to be 
implemented by organized corps of the MRND and the Coalition for 
the Defense of the Republic (CDR) (an extremist Tutu party) and 
groups of delinquent youths recruited for this purpose. Then, 
all Rwandan citizens were forced to kill or they too would be 
exterminated. Everyone who did not participate in the massacre 
was endangered, as was everyone who helped and hid the victims. 
Today, those who have killed are afraid and wonder what will 
happen to them, whether or not they will be forgiven. In 
reality, we have to distinguish between the leaders who herded 
the people before them, and the poor manipulated peasants who 
acted to save their own skins. 
  [Braeckman] Is there any chance of an amnesty? 
  [Kanyerengwe] Certainly not. It is because all past crimes 
and successive massacres have gone unpunished that we have the 
current drama. We want to end the cycle of violence. We want 
the leaders to be arrested and we want the international 
community to help us do this. 
<H5>  The Main Problem Is Abandoned Children and Orphans </H5>
  [Braeckman] Why do you insist that the people remain grouped 
together, even in those areas controlled by the RPF? 
  [Kanyerengwe] For safety reasons: We are trying to organize 
people in the areas we hold, and we know that the Interhamwe 
[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic militia] are hiding 
in the hills. That is why we are controlling movements people, 
at least for the time being. It is also true that the fighting 
is continuing at such a rate that the administration cannot keep 
up, and there are gray areas. We must first chase out the 
Interhamwe. Then, of course, we plan to let the people return to 
their homes. 
  [Braeckman] The refugees in Tanzania accuse the RPF of 
having 
carried out massacres, too. 
  [Kanyerengwe] I know. We have made inquiries about where 
these massacres we are supposed to have committed took place. 
The state of decomposition of the bodies found there shows 
clearly that these people were killed a long time before the RPF 
arrived in these areas. We also know that this is what is being 
said by people who themselves participated in the killings and 
are now hiding abroad. 
  [Braeckman] What will be Rwanda's main problem in the 
future? 
  [Kanyerengwe] The problem of abandoned children and orphans. 
There are thousands, tens of thousands of such children 
wandering around the country, wounded, mutilated, and 
traumatized. We appeal to all nongovernmental organizations, to 
all the friends of Rwanda, to come to the aid of the children of 
our country.

  [Excerpt] In Rwanda, fighting with heavy weapons continued 
today on several fronts. The counteroffensive launched on 
Monday [6 June] by the regular army is reported to have failed. 
Valerie Hirsch reports: 
  [Hirsch] Violent fighting is taking place on three fronts: 
north of Kigali, where the army has launched an attack from the 
town of Ruhengeri, in the capital itself, and 20 km from 
Gitarama, the town where the interim government has taken refuge. 
  According to the United Nations, the army has not regained 
any ground from the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which is 
still holding the initiative in the fighting. 
  However, the Front does not want a military victory. This is 
what the RPF president said in an interview published this 
morning by LE SOIR. 
  Besides, according to the Ugandan president, the Front is 
not 
in a position to get the upper hand militarily. President 
Museveni, who is considered an ally of the RPF, has criticized 
the Front: they have to accept a cease-fire, the Ugandan 
president said, because the international community has promised 
to try those behind the slaughter. 
  Negotiations on a truce in the fighting will resume on 
Thursday, 9 June or Friday in Kigali. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Kigali, June 7 (AFP) -- Rwandan troops and 
rebels exchanged fire on Tuesday [7 June] in the capital Kigali 
and close to Gitarama, the interim government's base, as the 
United Nations postponed a new round of peace talks planned for 
Wednesday. 
  Heavy shelling and small arms fire rocked several parts of 
the city in the morning as several empty UN trucks for Kabale on 
the Ugandan border to load up with relief supplies flown into 
Uganda's Entebbe airport Monday. Kigali airport has been closed 
since Sunday when it was shelled by government forces just after 
a UN flight had landed. 
  The fighting died down during the day in a city largely 
deserted by its inhabitants, where the rebels are pitted against 
the army and extremist Hutu militias who have holed up in the 
southwestern Nyamirambo district. 
  Government forces also battled the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF) about three kilometres (two miles) from Gitarama, 50 
kilometres (30 miles) from Kigali, Colonel Mooen Ahmed, 
operations chief in the UN mission, said. 
  The leader of the General Paul Kagame, late Monday said his 
men had pushed back the government troops, who had begun what UN 
officials described as a "major counter-offensive." Fighting 
was also reported to the north of Kigali, in the direction of 
rebel-held Ruhengeri. The army has sent reinforcements 
northwards to try to halt rebel advances. [passage omitted on 
previously filed material] 
  A UN spokesman announced that ceasefire talks planned for 
Wednesday had been postponed for at least 24 hours because the 
chairman of the talks, Ghanaian Gen. Henry Anyidoho, was out of 
the country and had been unable to fly directly back to Kigali. 
"Even if he arrives on Tuesday night, he'll need time to 
prepare for the talks, which will now be held on Thursday or 
Friday," UN civilian spokesman Pierre Mehu said. 
  Anyidoho, the deputy chief of the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR), had left the Kenyan capital Nairobi for Kampala 
in Uganda, flown by helicopter to the border and was to make his 
way to Kigali by road, Mehu said. 
  Two sessions of UN-mediated talks took place last week, 
enabling agreements to be reached on evacuating civilians and 
providing food and medical aid amid the battle, but led to no 
ceasefire accord. [passage omitted] 
  The international Red Cross has evacuated more than 700 
orphans and abandoned children from Butare in the south, a town 
still in government hands, to Burundi, a Red Cross official 
said. [passage omitted] About a hundred more children, some 
with dreadful injuries perpetrated in cold blood, arrived 
overnight in Rome in an evacuation operation mounted by the 
Italian Red Cross and government. 
  The children, some under a year old, were all taken to Rome 
hospitals and will eventually find foster families, Maria Pia 
Fanfani, president of the Italian Red Cross, said.

Government and UNICEF were in Mulindi, Byumba Prefecture, where 
they held talks with representatives of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF]. [passage omitted] 
  The talks ended with the donation of a large amount of money 
which Italy intends to offer to Rwanda. According to agreements 
reached with the RPF, the money will be used for assisting 
refugees and war-displaced people, particularly in the areas of 
nutrition, health care, and assistance to the orphan population 
caused by the massacres.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 7 Jun (AFP) -- The Zairian opposition 
press today published the criticisms leveled against France on 5 
June at a rally organized by the Union for Democracy and Social 
Progress [UDPS], Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi's radical opposition 
party. 
  UPDS executive committee member Kibassa Maliba had on that 
occasion severely criticized France's position on Zaire -- 
France was accused of "supporting dictatorship" -- and announced 
that a campaign would be organized to boycott French interests 
in Zaire. 
  According to LE PHARE, this is a "real declaration of holy 
war reminiscent of what Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] 
has launched against French interests, in particular. 
  "Both in Kinshasa and up-country, people are today convinced 
that France does not deserve anything better than the war now 
being waged against her by FIS fighters," the paper continued. 
  "Thank God," the paper adds, "the difference is that the 
Bantu is essentially nonviolent by nature." So, French 
nationals in Zaire do not risk waking up one day to the reality 
of finding their throats cut, their children's heads smashed, 
and their women raped. But it must be repeated that this does 
not in anyway attenuate the hatred which the Zairian public 
henceforth has for this Mitterrand style of hypocrisy. 
  In its own installment, LE PALMARES is of the view that 
"France is a thorn in the flesh of Democratic Zaire" and accuses 
her of "infiltrating the Zairian democratic process to draw 
attractive dividends from it." 
  The paper further writes, "France is enticed by the hope of 
deriving economic benefits from the rich Central African 
region." For its part, LA REFERENCE-PLUS points out that "the 
spontaneous enthusiasm" created by the criticisms leveled 
against France among participants at the 5 June rally is a 
testimony "that it will not be a good thing for a countryman of 
Francois Mitterrand to invest tomorrow in Zaire."

  [Text] Lagos, June 7 (AFP) -- Former senators who went into 
hiding after criticising Nigeria's military regime, indicated 
Tuesday [7 June] they would surrender within 48 hours. A 
spokesman for the group told AFP by phone that they would 
surrender "en masse within the next 48 hours". 
  He expressed the hope that former members of the dissolved 
house of representatives, also sought for opposing the November 
takeover of General Sani Abacha, would surrender themselves to 
the security agents after the senators have done so. 
  Four of the senate members have so far been arrested and 
detained in the past week for their opposition to the government 
and for calling the Abacha government "illegal" in a communique 
issued last Wednesday. In it they called on Abacha to stand 
down to pave the way for the installation of Chief Moshood 
Abiola, the undeclared winner of presidential elections held 
last June 12 and cancelled immediately afterwards. 
  Two of the ex-senators under arrest, namely former Senate 
president Ameh Ebute and Polycarp Nwite were formally charged in 
a federal high court on Monday with "conspiracy and sedition", 
an offence punishable by life imprisonment on conviction. Many 
other legislators are being hunted by the police, some of them 
stated from their hidouts. 
  "The legislators are prepared to pay the price for 
democracy. 
Democracy is not achieved on a platter of gold, anywhere in the 
world and so, we must keep on the struggle to achieve it, not 
minding the pains that go along with it", one of the ex-senators 
said. "If we (legislators) are arrested, that may not be the end 
(of the struggle). Rather, I strongly believe that it will be 
the beginning", he told in a call to AFP by cellular phone. 
  The senators said Monday that plans were afoot to groom "a 
relief group" that would take over the struggle if the present 
crop of legislators in the forefront of the struggle were jailed. 
  One of the events being organised by the legislators in 
conjunction with the recently-formed National Democratic 
Coalition (NADECO) opposition group, is a "solidarity visit" on 
Wednesday to Abiola's Lagos residence by representatives of some 
pro-democracy groups who will urge him to form a government. 
  The deputy leader of the military junta Lieutenant-General 
Oladipo Diya warned on Monday in the northern town of Kaduna 
that the regime would "not spare" any individual or group who 
threatened its transition programme, press reports said Tuesday.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has again 
called on Nigerians to use the forthcoming constitutional 
conference to reinforce their belief in the unity of the 
country. He was speaking in Abuja today when the Idoma 
Traditional Council, led by the Ochi Idoma, Dr. Abraham Ajemi 
Okpabi, paid him a solidarity visit. 
  Gen. Abacha said that the nonpartisan nature of the 
constitutional conference was deliberately designed to provide 
all Nigerians with the opportunity to present all their views 
and interests for consideration at a national forum. 
  He reemphasized the need for Nigeria to draw up its own form 
of democratic peculiar to its culture and political aspiration. 
  Earlier, the Ochi Idoma had pledged the loyalty of the 
people 
to the present administration. Dr. Okpabi appealed to all 
Nigerians to support the government's transition program and 
work toward the promotion of peace and stability in the country.

  [Text] The military has reaffirmed that it will not 
participate in the forthcoming constitutional conference. This 
was again emphasized by the director of defense information, 
Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, in Zaria, Kaduna State, while 
answering questions from newsmen. He said that as an 
organization responsible for the defense of the sovereignty and 
integrity of the nation, the military should not take part in 
the conference. Gen. Chijuka said that the Armed Forces 
expected Nigerians to [words indistinct] rather than the 
military asking to play certain roles in the government of the 
country. On the Bakassi Peninsula, the director stated that 
Nigerian troops had succeeded in checking the activities of the 
Cameroonian gendarmes.

  [Text] The regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko of the 
Republic of Zaire is still bent on destabilizing Angola. That 
is why it is permitting its territory to be used as an emporium 
for the supply of weapons and other logistical means to Jonas 
Savimbi's organization. Our correspondent Joao Caluque reports 
from Moxico Province: 
  Commander Jose Joao Rafael says that Jonas Savimbi's 
organization is receiving logistical supplies from trains 
travelling from Bilondo in Zaire to Luau District of Moxico 
Province, which has a border with that country. The commander 
of the government forces in Moxico says that another consignment 
of military equipment is being carried by aircraft coming from 
Zaire. Within Angola light aircraft transport the equipment out 
of Luau, Cazombo, and Lumbala N'guimbo Districts in Moxico 
Province. Speaking about the immediate intentions of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in 
the province, Brigadier Jose Joao Rafael also said that Jonas 
Savimbi's organization has brought into Moxico more than two 
battalions with the aim of attacking and dislodging government 
forces from positions in the city of Luena.

  [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of

long-range guns. The early hours of today were characterized by 
powerful blasts from shells fired by long-range guns and 
successive attacks by Jamba's men against positions held by 
government forces. The aim is to take the martyred city of 
Kuito by storm. Military sources with the Angolan Armed Forces 
Bie Operational Command say there is a strong indication that 
the war could intensify over the next few hours. The number of 
dead is increasing alarmingly. Provisional figures for the past 
24 hours say 16 people were killed and 52 wounded.

  [Text] The headquarters of the Northeastern Military Front 
in Malanje today issued a report saying that since dawn today 
clashes have been under way in the Cambondo location of Caculama 
District, some 19 km from Malanje. 
  During the clashes in Dumba, (?Tema), and Cambondo regions, 
the combined FAA Angolan Armed Forces, National Police, and 
Civilian Defense forces killed 23 rebels and captured 17 
weapons, 13 antitank missiles, 14 antitank land mines, three 
antipersonnel land mines, eight Claymore antipersonnel land 
mines, eight TNT charges, 65 meters of a slow burning fuse. 
  Government forces launched a hot pursuit operation against 
the rebels in the Lau Comercial location, 16 km north of 
Malanje. The rebels fled eastward. On 6 June government forces 
spotted UNITA rebels on a chicken farm. Six UNITA soldiers were 
killed and eight AKM's, nine clips, 3,757 rounds of ammunition 
of various caliber, and one antitank land mine were recovered. 
  Meanwhile, in Kuito there was a lull in clashes this 
afternoon. The International Committee of the Red Cross used the 
opportunity to distribute food to the residents. The house of 
Belgium's Doctors Without Borders was hit by more than five 
shells during UNITA's attacks last night and at dawn today.

  [Begin Jota recording] The Angolan Armed Forces are capable 
of bombing Huambo at any moment of the day or night but had not 
done so until now. On this occasion, they bombed Huambo as an 
act of retaliation against UNITA because of what UNITA has been 
doing in Bie. [end recording] 
  That was Brigadier Jota confirming that Huambo has been

  [Text] General Jose Pedro, commander of the Cabinda 
Military Region, has accused the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Front for the Liberation 
of the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] of jointly having murdered five 
civilians in the Micuma area -- two men, two women, and a child. 
  [Begin recording] [Pedro] A few days ago we were working to 
establish the connection between Bucu-Zau and Belize, since the 
bridge over (Bungozimunu) River had been destroyed. We were 
reconstructing the bridge to permit the free movement of people 
and goods between the two districts, as well as with the city. 
Considering previous UNITA and FLEC activities, it is not 
surprising that two days ago they again discharged their fury on 
civilians, killing five people including a year-old child. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Where did this happen? 
  [Pedro] In the Micuma Primeiro village. 
  [Correspondent] It has been reported that UNITA forces are 
entering the Viede settlement near the border with Zaire, 
heading toward Necuto, which is described as Front for the 
Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda 
[FLEC-FAC] headquarters. Do you have anything to say about the 
issue? 
  [Pedro] It is no news that they are entering Viede. As you 
know, UNITA's main bases are in the Zairian territory, and it is 
from there that it carries out attacks in Cabinda Province. It 
is only possible for UNITA to carry out operations in that area 
with a major cooperation of the FLEC-FAC, since without the 
cooperation of FLEC-FAC it is impossible for them to operate 
there. 
  [Correspondent] Has the Military Front Command taken 
measures 
in view of this? 
  [Pedro] Yes, we are taking measures, and you will be 
informed 
of them. [end recording]

  [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano said 
today that his ruling party, Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation 
Front], acknowledges that many initiatives could have already 
been taken to resolve the most serious problems affecting 
Mozambican society, particularly now that peace prevails in the 
country. President Chissano said there was indecision in 
dealing with problems like corruption and slackness, but that 
was to ease the transition from war to peace. 
  Chissano added that his colleagues realize that the 
government has not introduced corrective measures to deal with a 
number of serious problems because it is facing a lack of means 
due to the 16-year war. 
  President Chissano, who has been chairing the Frelimo 
Central 
Committee's second special session since yesterday, said Frelimo 
and its cadres are aware of the solutions to be introduced to 
resolve the country's main problems. He added that far reaching 
initiatives have been taken to improve the situation. That 
appears to have been the message Chissano conveyed during his 
recent tours of Nampula and Cabo Delgado Provinces. 
  Commenting on the confinement and demobilization of 
government and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] troops, 
he said government troops are being demobilized despite a brief 
interruption. Turning to an alleged proposal from Renamo leader 
Afonso Dhlakama that his men could be demobilized at their bases 
without having to report to assembly areas, Chissano said: 
  [Begin Chissano recording] I think that would be against the 
peace accord. The accord ought to be adhered to as long as it 
is possible to do so. Right now we think it is possible to 
fulfill the accord, particularly because Renamo does not have 
many troops left to demobilize. So, one does not understand why 
Renamo troops should be demobilized at their bases. I think 
troops can still be confined to assembly bases. [end recording]

  [Text] The Mozambican Government has denied statements by 
UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello that it withdrew 
complaints made last week against a memorandum sent to the 
Supervision and Control Commission by Colonel Segala, chairman 
of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. The memorandum concerns 
differences of figures for government military personnel to be 
confined in 29 areas recommended by the United Nations. The 
NOTICIAS newspaper quotes Lieutenant Colonel Osorio Mateus, 
assistant of the government's representative in the CCF, as 
saying that our complaints are still in force. He questioned if 
there wasn't another intention behind Aldo Ajello's statements 
on 3 June, that the government withdrew its complaints.

already completed training. A ceremony was held in Boane today, 
marking the end of the first phase of infantry training. The 
ceremony coincided with the close of the course for the third 
battalion that had been undergoing training for the past six 
weeks. The ceremony was chaired by Tobias Dai and Herminio 
Morais, head of the government and Mozambique National 
Resistance delegations to the Joint Commission for the Formation 
of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, respectively. Also 
present at the event was British Ambassador Richard Edis and 
other officials. The two other battalions were trained at the 
Manhica and Dondo centers. Sources close to the training of the 
new army say the new training phase will begin shortly [words 
indistinct] before the October elections.

  [Text] Aldo Ajello has categorically denied allegations 
that the government has withdrawn from the CCF [Cease-Fire 
Commission]. In its edition yesterday under the title "Is Peace 
Already Burning?" IMPARCIAL, widely regarded as a mirror of 
Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] positions, reported: 
"The government yesterday indefinitely suspended, without any 
explanation, its participation in the CCF, in the most serious 
incident between the former warring factions since the General 
Peace Accord was signed." 
  "It is a lie," Ajello said, when we contacted him yesterday 
morning to learn whether the government had effectively 
withdrawn from the CCF. "What happened was this: The government 
has requested for the suspension of the meetings of all 
commissions scheduled for this week, due to meetings Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front] is holding at present. Nothing 
else." 
  Ajello says that the government's request was made through 
Ambassador Francisco Madeira, diplomatic adviser to President 
Chissano. 
  In a telephone interview, Madeira confirmed these reports to 
MEDIAFAX. "We only requested the postponement of planned 
meetings. We needed time to consider all issues so that we may 
hold productive meetings. We shall meet again on 10 June." 
  The UN special representative confirmed that "the 
postponement is not for the whole week, just until the evening 
of 9 June. On 10 June there will be a tripartite meeting of the 
CCF which will be followed by the regular meeting on 13 June. 
The CSC [Supervision and Control Commission] will meet on 14 
June." 
  Ajello commented: "At present nothing is happening that 
should be described as alarming." 
  We asked Francisco Madeira whether there was a serious 
obstacle within the government affecting the process of the 
demobilization of soldiers. 
  "Not at all. We are still committed to this process. Ajello 
himself has already confirmed the list of 5,000 soldiers which 
we have confined, and within a few days the government will once 
again present the list of soldiers to be demobilized." 
  Regarding the differences between the government and CCF 
Chairman Colonel Pier Segala, Ajello reiterated what he had 
already said: "The government has withdrawn the charges against 
Colonel Segala." 
  In yesterday's edition of NOTICIAS, Lieutenant Colonel 
Osorio 
Mateus denied Ajello's allegations, saying the government 
maintained the charges against Segala. "Deputy Minister Tomas 
Salomao, the government's representative in the CSC, has twice 
agreed with my proposal for the government to withdraw the 
charges." 
  "And it was on 17 May, not on 27 May," Ajello added, 
referring to the relevant date mentioned by Osorio Mateus. 
  Madeira told MEDIAFAX that, "there has been a 
misunderstanding over the whole of this issue." 
  "Within a few days everything will be clarified."

  [Text] Kampala 7 Jun (PANA) -- President Yoweri Museveni of 
Uganda has urged the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) to 
accept a ceasefire and work toward power sharing. Addressing 
newsmen in Kampala Monday [6 June], he said RPF has no capacity 
to capture power and topple the current Rwandan Government 
quickly. 
  Museveni was addressing the press for the first time after 
his return Saturday from a 12-day working trip to the Nordic 
countries. He said that a quick victory for the RPF which lacked 
equipment, would be long and elusive. "Even if you win totally, 
you would have to share power" said the Ugandan president, who 
came to power in January 1986 after a gruelling five-year 
guerrilla war. He said condemnation of the on-going genocide by 
the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human 
Rights Commission was a sound basis for the rebels to accept a 
ceasefire. The latter would even help in having the 
perpetrators of genocide tried. 
  "If RPF insists on fighting, I think they are making a 
mistake in my view -- fighting has its own problems," added 
Museveni, who has been accused by Rwanda of aiding the rebels. 
  Reacting to international suspicions that his government was 
backing the RPF he said "if we armed them, it would be a 
different story. Without equipment, RPF would never get a quick 
victory. My advice was and is -- you don't have equipment and 
the international community is willing to investigate -- why 
don't you have a ceasefire instead of wasting our time." 
  Asked why there were numerous international delegations 
jetting into Uganda in search of a solution to the Rwanda war, 
the president said they had the wrong address. "The suspicion 
about Uganda being the RPF's quartermasters, [words indistinct] 
from the history of the Rwandan diaspora, because most of them 
had been in Uganda and in the National Resistance Army (NRA). 
The problem is they (international community) tend to have 
stereotype perceptions" Museveni added. He said it was 
ignorance on the part of the accusers to imagine the RPF or any 
other force could never fight a war without being externally 
aided with arms. He cited his NRA as an example. "I smuggled 
arms through Rwanda without the knowledge of (the late Gen. 
Habyarimana's government). He said fighting forces could secure 
arms from several states without incumbent government knowing 
about it. He said he had written to the UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali to stop involving Uganda in the crisis.

  [Text] Cape Town June 7 SAPA -- Chief Justice Michael 
Corbett has agreed to continue in office for a further two 
years, Justice Minister Dullah Omar said on Tuesday. Mr Omar was 
speaking at a Cape Town press conference where he announced the 
appointment of advocate and academic Arthur Chaskalson as 
president of the Constitutional Court. 
  Mr Omar said Mr Justice Corbett's term of office was due to 
expire at the end of September, but he had accepted an 
invitation from President Nelson Mandela to stay on until 
December 31, 1996. 
  The chief justice will chair the newly-appointed Judicial 
Services Commission [JSC], which will nominate six of the 10 
judges of the Constitutional Court. 
  The JSC will also make recommendations on the appointment, 
tenure, term of office and removal from office of all judges and 
will advise the national and provincial governments on all 
matters relating to the judiciary and the administration of 
justice. 
  Other members of the JSC are: Mr Chaskalson; Natal 
Judge-President Mr Justice Alan Howard, representing the 
judges-president; Mr Omar or his nominee; Prof Etienne Mureinik 
of Wits [University of the Witwatersrand], representing the

Isabella Direko, Ernest Mchunu, Bulelani Ngcuka and Ray Radue; 
Advocates David Gordon, George Bizos, Kgomotso Moroka and trade

  Mr Omar said he was unable to announce the names of two 
practising advocates and two practising attorneys to serve on 
the JSC because different nominations had been forwarded by the 
Association of Law Societies and the General Council of the Bar 
on the one hand, and the Black Lawyers Association and National 
Association of Democratic Lawyers on the other. 
  However, negotiations were underway to resolve the matter so 
that Mr Justice Corbett could convene the first meeting of the 
JSC.

  [Text] The appointment of Mr. Arthur Chaskalson as 
president of the constitutional court has been welcomed by 
political parties and legal organizations. The announcement 
that a commission is to be named to appoint other members of the 
court has, however, been greeted with caution. The legal 
organization [not further specified] says the appointment of Mr. 
Chaskalson, a respected senior advocate from Johannesburg, is a 
blessing, and the commission represents a fine legal balance 
which will guarantee the appointment of independent members of 
the constitutional court. 
  The National Party has welcomed the appointment of Mr. 
Chaskalson, but has pointed out that nine of the 13 members of 
the commission are ANC sympathizers. The Democratic Party has 
also welcomed it, but also pointed out hat Mr. Chaskalson had 
close links with the ANC.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria June 8 SAPA -- Public Service and 
Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya said on Wednesday he would 
create at least 1,000 new civil service posts at all levels to 
address apartheid imbalances. "The Public Service Commission 
and I have (consequently) embarked on a programme to ensure that 
groups that are under-represented are targeted for immediate 
employment in the public service," Dr Skweyiya said in a 
statement. He said all existing posts which needed to be filled 
would be filled. "At least 1,000 posts will be made available 
for filling and the posts will be at all levels, ranging from 
entry posts up to and including posts in the management 
echelons," he said. 
  A spokesman said this included directors-general of 
government departments. Earlier this week, Dr Skweyiya 
announced the promulgation of a public service act that lays 
down guidelines for the rationalisation of the central 
government and former homeland civil service corps. 
  Dr Skweyiya said "the filling of posts will be dealt with 
within existing budgetary allocations". He said he was 
establishing a "component to assist the (Public Service) 
Commission [PSC] with all issues relating to representivity will 
be established in the office of the PSC. [sentence as received] 
  "An organisational component will be established in each 
department to assist the management in promoting representivity. 
A data base will be established to analyse the composition of 
the public service continuously. The public service as a career 
will be promoted amongst under-represented groups." 
  Dr Skweyiya indicated that he already had several candidates 
for some posts. "I am aware of many well-qualified persons from 
under- represented groups who could play a key role in the 
public service. I call on them to respond positively when posts 
are advertised." 
  Dr Skweyiya said that although the posts were aimed at 
under- 
represented groups, persons from "other groups" were welcome to 
apply. Serving civil servants could also apply. He said 
departments would be advised that where a Public Service 
Commission had already made recommendations on the filling of a 
post, that recommendation was withdrawn with immediate effect. 
He said the posts would be re-advertised. 
  In addition to existing vacancies, further employment 
opportunities would be created. "If suitable candidates apply 
for these positions, new posts will be created in consultation 
with departments." 
  Dr Skweyiya said the new government was committed to 
transforming the public service into a democratic, non-sexist 
and non-racial public service to serve all South Africans. 
  "After the struggle against apartheid all South Africans are 
anxiously waiting for the transformation of the public service. 
In this regard my ministry will do its utmost to ensure that, 
in the spirit of the Reconstruction and Development Programme 
and of the new constitution, the public service will be 
restructured to serve the needs of all South Africans. 
  "South Africa's public service is not broadly representative 
and therefore fails to comply with the constitutional 
requirements of Section 212(2)(B). This needs to be addressed 
as a matter of urgency. The problem is not just the lack of 
representation of racial groups in many categories, but also 
gross under-representation of women, particularly black women. 
A well-planned and structured approach, comprising definite 
positive actions by the Public Service Commission, the 
provincial service commissions, departments and management at 
all levels is called for."

  [Text] Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen questioned the 
establishment of the truth commission. General Viljoen said he 
did not believe that the commission would help with 
reconciliation and that its findings would negatively influence 
the public. Turning to the granting of amnesty, he said a case 
could be made concerning the extension of the amnesty date to 
May the 10th, the date of President Mandela's inauguration.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] One of the most contentious issues, which the Truth 
Commission will have to face, is what to do about politically 
motivated crimes committed after December the 5th last year. 
More than 30 members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, the 
AWB, which boycotted the April elections, were picked up in 
connection with the wave of bombings in the last days of the 
campaign. On the line to Johannesburg, Timothy Ecott asked AWB 
spokesman Fred Rundle how he reacted to the setting up of the 
Truth Commission: 
  [Begin recording] [Rundle] Well, that's what they perceive 
to 
be abuse. You mustn't forget that Mr. Dullah Omar is a 
communist, a member of the Communist Party. You must also 
remember my people will never bow down before any man. They 
will only bow in front of God. 
  [Ecott] But Mr. Omar is the justice minister and it seems 
like an attempt by the government to get to the bottom of who 
may or may not be guilty of human rights abuse in the past and 
in the present. 
  [Rundle] We offered them our hand in an attempt to bring 
about peace. We said to them: give amnesty to all right 
wingers awaiting trial, the same as the De Klerk did to their 
people and those that have been convicted, and we will suspend 
our struggle while we are negotiating for a volkstaat 
[homeland]. He has rejected this by his cut off date in 
December. We believe, as I say here, no government can blame 
the flame of freedom burning in the hearts of our people. No 
government can build enough jails to lock up an entire nation. 
We will get our volkstaat no matter what the cost. We go on and 
we also say: what they have now done by their proposed amnesty 
legislation is to create a huge powder keg which begs to be 
ignited by all and sundry opposing the authoritarian and 
antiwhite method of government. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Armscor Executive General Manager Tielman de </F>
Waal by defense correspondent Norman Chandler; place and date 
not given -- first pagragraph is THE STAR introduction] 
  [Text] Amscor's [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] 
executive general manager, Tielman de Waal, speaks about the 
organisation and its future role in southern Africa in general: 
  Q: What problems has Armscor faced in adjusting to its new 
role and function since converting to its new status as the 
acquisition organisation for the SANDF [South African National 
Defence Force]? 
  A: It has primarily been an organisational and functional 
change. We had to change our vision of the present and future 
South Africa as well as our view of Armscor's position in the 
country's economic household (and this) involved scaling down 
manpower activities in certain areas, and strengthening manpower 
in others. Our relationship with the arms industry has never 
been healthier. 
  Q: Do you place a high premium on local companies increasing 
their international market share? 
  A: Exports are of paramount importance for the economy to 
grow to required levels over the next 10 years. Companies have, 
for too long, suffered from a "blockade mentality" and need to 
broaden their outlook. The only way our economy can grow is 
through active participation in international markets. To be 
successful, however, we need to become far more productive and 
competitive. 
  The arms industry has a tremendous advantage over other 
players who have been manufacturing under licence agreements 
from overseas companies for a considerable time (as) Armscor's 
producers are mostly unique and that is why the arms industry is 
the [as published] 
  Q: How do you see Armscor's future as the acquisition 
organisation for the SANDF? 
  A: Since the SANDF will need to replace most of its major 
equipment over the next two decades, or face a massive reduction 
of its capabilities, Armscor will still have a vital function to 
fulfill. 
  The local military industry will have to contend with full 
foreign competition, and this means it will have to look closely 
at performance, value and cost-effectiveness. 
  We are not only acquiring capital equipment for the army but 
are engaged in procuring everyday necessities, which may sound 
mundane but are important for the well-being of the soldier -- 
items ranging from basic foodstuffs to socks and boots. 
  Q: What specific areas of growth would there be for Armscor? 
  A: There are tremendous growth opportunities, not only in 
servicing established clients, but also extending services to 
government institutions. We can also be of invaluable help to 
other countries in southern Africa, and this is an area in which 
I perceive growth potential. 
  The whole of the sub-continent has a wealth of military 
vehicles and equipment left over from recent wars (and) these 
need to be maintained and upgraded. Armscor's biggest growth 
area, however, lies in the field of counter trade, in which we 
are the leaders in this country. 
  By being active in this field, we can contribute towards the 
growth of industrial enterprise and contribute further towards 
the saving of foreign exchange and new job opportunities.

<F P=106> [Article by Norman Chandler] </F>
  [Text] America has the Avon cosmetics lady and the Fuller 
brush salesman, both of whom have become part of that country's 
folklore. 
  Destined to become part of South African legend is the 
"Armscor [Armament Corporation of South Africa] Man"...now 
hanging up his hat after 17 years of foot-in-the-door 
international canvassing to convince the world that South Africa 
needed military equipment and offering, in return, 
top-of-the-range systems to anyone with the capability to pay 
cash or barter. 
  Like the cosmetics lady and the brush salesman, "Armscor 
Man" 
has on occasion been spectacularly successful, but has also, at 
the same time, endured a hard, long slog in representing a 
beleaguered armaments industry trying to reach out 
internationally during years of weapons sanctions imposed by the 
United Nations as part of the campaign to end apartheid. 
  Last month, the UN decided apartheid had ended and, as a 
result, the imposition of crippling sanctions should also be 
terminated. That was, of course, due in no small measure to the 
stunning victory at the polls of President Mandela's ANC. 
  -- The story of how Armscor -- the Armaments Corporation of 
South Africa -- developed its expertise in a number of fields 
will probably remain classified for years, but from what little 
is known the company has taken South Africa into the big league 
of arms manufacturers, exporters and procurers. 
  -- Executive general manager Tielman de Waal went on record 
immediately after the lifting of sanctions as saying: "Armscor 
will be able to conduct its business in an open and transparent 
way. 
  "We do not foresee that the lifting of the (UN) embargo will 
substantially change the procurement pattern of the past, except 
that foreign procurement will no longer have to be conducted in 
secret, and it can be conducted in a more cost-effective manner." 
  The organisation is at pains to emphasise that its staff did 
not conduct highly secretive meetings in the back alleys of 
Baghdad, Casablanca or other such mysterious cities but rather 
"worked the room", as the saying goes, finally getting what it 
wanted in the boardrooms of the world. 
  What has been acquired overseas remains a matter for 
conjecture. 
  Armscor calls its acquisitions operations (or sales pitch, 
in 
plain English) the "value-for-money option", with expertise on 
tap to provide specialist guidance to ensure maximum 
cost-savings, without sacrificing quality and product capability. 
  During the last five years, the organisation has made 
acquisitions totalling R30 billion [rand], the bulk of which has 
been for South Africa's defence force. 
  Armscor says: "This was made possible through a 
well-developed system comprising dedicated teamwork, the highest 
technical expertise, strict financial discipline, advanced 
project management and marketing, quality assurance, logistical 
support and product-lifecycle management." 
  Behind those claims are the men and women who have put South 
Africa at the cutting edge of international armaments, as well 
as of commercial products. 
  Peet Smith, the company's general manager for import and 
export control, puts it rather quaintly: "We can assist in 
bringing the horse (the international client) and the water (the 
South African product) together. In the end, the attractiveness 
and the taste of the water will determine how much the horse is 
going to drink." 
  The water has certainly been tested by many governments. 
Horses such as Iraq have liked our long-range artillery pieces, 
such as the G5 used in the Kuwaiti war and earlier in the 
10-year battle between Iraq and Iran. Oman is buying Rooivalk 
attack helicopters, regarded as far more efficient than anything 
else on earth (Britain is evaluating the machine as well). 
  Certain unnamed countries have battle-tested armoured 
equipment and mine-resistant vehicles, and assault rifles have 
been sold to many others. 
  Also coming to light is how Armscor coped with the 
international leaders in the armaments field, as well as with 
the end of the Cold War, and what it has been doing since in the 
local and international markets. 
  With the disintegration of the former Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics, the end of Russian influence in Angola, the 
end of the total onslaught era and the abolition of apartheid, 
the organisation had to find something else to do other than 
sell weapons, which had suddenly become a dirty word in the 
maelstrom of international politics. 
  It decided that to guarantee the survival of the highly 
focused local armaments industry, and at the same time ensure 
continuing state-of-the-art technology, adaptation was the name 
of the game. 
  Armscor decided to split into two: the original company 
continuing to acquire armaments and related products and 
services, and the new firm -- known as Denel (Pty) Ltd, with a 
host of subsidiaries -- the manufacturer. 
  During the 1980s, Armscor was a "fully fledged player in the 
international arms market", but was winning customers in the 
marketplace "through liaison at ministerial and other levels." 
  As part of its legacy as an armaments organisation, Armscor 
at the end of March last year had paid R3.6 billion for 
armaments out of its share of the Special Defence Equipment and 
Activities Account (SDA) -- part of the R10 billion defence 
budget. 
  The SDA is an account which, unlike many in other government 
departments, need not be fully spent during the fiscal year. 
Eighty percent of the money can be committed for the following 
year, and the year thereafter. 
  Outstanding commitments on contract at that time stood at 
R4.2 billion and approved commitments not yet contracted 
totalled about R668 million, with a further R93 million in fixed 
assets with contractors. 
  The effort now is concentrated on technological 
sophistication, which could in fact be of help in non-military 
products and processes, similar to the United States's space 
programme, which has helped bring many products to the consumer 
marketplace over the years.
